<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Frank, Yeah I live in a house that&#x27;s had lots of activity for the 
past 34 years.  We are the longest residents to remain in the house and 
it surprises even some former residents who stopped by on New Year&#x27;s 
day and confirmed a lot of what we&#x27;ve experinced in the house, 
including the black robed figure in the bedrooms.

I&#x27;ve never done the pipe ceremony, I do meditation and stuff with 
chrystals and stones. 
It&#x27;s just very cool to finally get some EVP from the house :) 
next up is a digital camera....any advice from the tech arena as to 
which cheap camera is good to take pictures?

&gt;  Ya don&#x27;t have to go anywhere &quot;haunted&quot; to get spirit contacts, they 
&gt; will come to you. I have not done an investigation yet, I went to one 
&gt; of Chris Moon&#x27;s GHUs to observe once, and went to the Stanley to see 
&gt; the new Mini box, but not to investigate. Not only that, I don&#x27;t ask 
&gt; questions (or rarely ask questions), nor ask for any certain 
&gt; individuals. I used to protection stuff, particuallt Native Amnerican 
&gt; type pipe ceramony, but they convinced me to stop smoking, and I 
won&#x27;t 
&gt; even touch the pipe for fear of the tabaco hook. So I just don&#x27;t do 
any 
&gt; of that stuff, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.
