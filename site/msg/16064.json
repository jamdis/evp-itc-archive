See the video halfway down this page:\n\nhttp://www.keyportparanormal.com/ghostboxsamplevideos.html\n\nAlso, just a heads up:  I think it&#39;s kind of frowned upon to call the entities &quot;demons.&quot;  Even &quot;spirits&quot; can be questioned in some circles, as there seems to be evidence not all of those we talk to have lived as a human being on earth.\n\nJill\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, JeffL1965 &lt;JeffL1965@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi group!\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve just been approved, and can&#39;t wait to learn more about the EVP field,\n&gt; as I&#39;m very interested in it, and the Paranormal. :-)\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Without getting too OT, I hope, can some kind soul tell me what other\n&gt; similar devices there are to this? I recall seeing one such box that a\n&gt; spirit/demon communicates with a synthesized voice using only 1 word. I\n&gt; think this one will be very helpful to me as well, as I begin my Paranormal\n&gt; research career.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance, and eagerly looking forward to learning from all of you.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff\n&gt;"}
