putting two good quality audio amps in series (solder new input to radio/cdplayer.  direct couple center prong.  capacitor couple ground prong) makes it j-u-s-t possible to hear suspect voices directly without need to record.  this helps immensely in experimenting.  the voices are still too weak to understand very well  but are buried in 60 cycle hum, which can be filtered, and not in noise.
   
  most of this stuff didnt work with 1930 technology or with 1980 technology but a lot more of it can be made to produce now with kmart or walmart inexpensive radios amps etc , especially when coupled with ultra-hot front end using mrf901,mrf571,mrf904,mrf9011,mrf981--which are now cheap/obsolete(?!) but were too expensive to risk in early 1980's
