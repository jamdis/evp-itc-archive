<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Been gettng something aobut May 17th, now &quot;they&quot; say it starts May
15th--I&#x27;m like WTF is this? There seems to be othere that have  pridistion
as well, but it&#x27;s almost as reliable as this stuff. This is from EVPmkaer
tonight, using the origianl raw files I used ten years ago.

&quot;Thanks for writing Frank!  However, it was not me who made the
prediction....I was talking about a Christian scholar who has done some
research and through his recalculation has determined that the predicted
2012 shift will be occurring around May 17th 2011...he also says this is the
date when Jesus will be returning to Earth.  Very interesting, we&#x27;ll
see......&quot;


Soooo, whatever.

F-S
