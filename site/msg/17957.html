What is your name RJ? and where do you live?  There are probably tons  of

RJ's in this world, and if i am going to ask any of my guides if they want =
to 
 play this game with you, I will not ask them to run around the world a=
 
lookin  for you. sf

I have placed a little=
 something on top of my computer monitor, right  in 
front of me. It is now=
 7/10/2010. I will leave it there 4 days, and remove  
it Noon Denver time,=
 on Wednesday, 7/14/2010.

All you have to do is ask  your boxes/spirits/al=
iens/etc, what it is.

I have taken a picture of  it, and posted it to the =
files section here, so 
there is no way I can squirm  out of the results:

(h=
ttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip) 

Ple=
ase  do not try to open the file before noon Wednesday. But feel free to 
d=
ownload  it to your computer beforehand, so you can be sure I won't change =

it during,  or after, the test.

Answers anyone reveals after noon Wednesd=
ay don't  count. Partial answers 
(like just the color, or shape, or some e=
motion vibe)  don't count. Just tell 
me what it is.

Best of Luck. I hope =
for this to  be a regularly occurring experiment, and 
I hope we all can le=
arn from the  results.
