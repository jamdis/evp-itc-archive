Sometimes we ask others =\r\nfor their \n        input.&nbsp; Sometimes we only hear it once someone else=\r\n tells us it \n        first.&nbsp; Sometimes we hear it wrong.&nbsp; Someti=\r\nmes we hear it \n        right. And so on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be useful to know=\r\n, as an individual, \n        how good we are at hearing it right, so we hav=\r\ne some idea how \n        trustworthy our skill, or methods, or technology, =\r\nis.&nbsp; If we can \n        measure that, or even get a feel for it, we ca=\r\nn look for ways to improve \n        it.&nbsp; If we can&#39;t measure it, then =\r\nwe could be stuck.&nbsp; \n        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, by restricting the answers on=\r\nly to the timeframe of the \n        experiment, we can help filter out some=\r\n of the problems of subjectivity: \n        for example, one theory is that =\r\npeople can hear what they want to hear, \n        or can these sounds in a c=\r\nertain way, once you already know the \n        answer.&nbsp; Or, given 2 wa=\r\nys to hear a sound, being influenced, even \n        subconsciously, to hear=\r\n it one way over the other.&nbsp; We want to rule \n        that out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;This is one reason we can only count on answers given \n        during the =\r\ntimeframe.&nbsp; That is when the answer is most \n        objective.&nbsp; =\r\nOnce the object has been announced, we move into \n        a&nbsp; period wh=\r\nere we can&#39;t discount possible influence from already \n        knowing the =\r\nanswer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, I am confident that if a person&#39;s method \n        or te=\r\nchnology really can reveal the correct answer outside the \n        timefram=\r\ne, then doing it within the timeframe should be just as easy, \n        and =\r\nwould then be a valid objective result for all to see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On \n     =\r\n   &lt;b&gt;Wed, 7/14/10, SnowfireL@aol. com \n        &lt;i&gt;&lt;SnowfireL@aol. com&g=\r\nt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid r=\r\ngb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: \n          SnowfireL@aol. com &lt;SnowfireL@aol=\r\n. com&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re: \n          [EVP-ITC] Experiment 20100710 - RESULT=\r\nS!&lt;br&gt;To: \n          EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;br&gt;Date: Wednesday, July 14, =\r\n2010, 2:50 \n          PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n          &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1951680305&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n          &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=3D=\r\n&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;div&gt;&lt;font color=\r\n=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;it doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s in \n        =\r\n  the whole file, I didn&#39;t think it was possible to have a radio sit on \n  =\r\n        top of a pc screen i guess.&nbsp; But, I know He did say it, that&#39;s=\r\n \n          all the proof I need. haha! &lt;G&gt; would you like the whole =\r\n4 \n          minute question the whole tape?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n          &lt;div&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n       =\r\n   &lt;div&gt;\n          &lt;div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;I=\r\nn a message dated \n          7/14/2010 5:46:11 P.M.
