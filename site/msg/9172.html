<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am a libertarian and believer in the laissez-faire market system (I use 
the lower-case libertarian as a subscriber to a political philosophy, not 
necessarily as a member of a political party). I figure that if this 
person is going to sell them and people are going to pay these prices, 
then that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to happen.  That market isn&#x27;t going to go on 
forever, and sooner or later people are not going to pay that much, if 
anything, for his product if they figure out it can be done more cheaply. 
Let supply and demand meet until demand diminishes. So I agree with the 
&quot;Do Nothing.&quot;

(Note it&#x27;s not me selling them - I only have one eBay logon and it&#x27;s w9sz, 
same as my ham radio callsign.)

&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I have been reading the back and forth posts about ideas on how to
&gt; deal with the individual selling the hacks on ebay for inflated
&gt; prices.
&gt;
&gt; I posted my thoughts on that individual yesterday. I would now like
&gt; to render my opinion as to the subject of what we or anyone can do
&gt; about it.
&gt;
&gt; My suggestion is DO NOTHING! Now before everybody&#x27;s jaw hits the
&gt; floor, hear me out.
&gt;
&gt; A couple of months ago I would have been the one to lead the charge
&gt; in the assault on this guy in the name of box justice.
&gt;
&gt; I can now say with confidence, That is not the way to handle it.
&gt; Let me explain why I believe this way. Without going into a lot of
&gt; detail, I was a tough street kid that grew up on the streets of
&gt; Brooklyn, I also served my country proudly for six years as a us army
&gt; green beret, then to a career as a FDNY Fireman whose heart and
&gt; health where both broken at 911.
&gt;
&gt; My point is, I have always lived my life believing that anything I
&gt; did not agree with or that did not fit my sense of right and wrong
&gt; whether it be right or wrong, could be easily solved with aggression
&gt; of some kind.
&gt;
&gt; It took a long while and much sole searching and a lot of
&gt; communication interpretation from our friends on the other side.
&gt; But I have come to learn that aggressive action in any form is
&gt; detrimental to the harmony and peace of the whole involved.
&gt;
&gt; Guy&#x27;s like this guy on ebay do not and can not last in the face of
&gt; good and well intentioned people that are here and willing and trying
&gt; to get the word of this miraculous research and spirit communication
&gt; out to as many people as are in need or want of it.
&gt;
&gt; That is how we can stop people like this bottom feeder. By spreading
&gt; the knowledge of this research from one person to the next. Our
&gt; friends have stated time and time again that any negative energy will
&gt; be detrimental to the communication and the research, and positive
&gt; harmony and vibration will serve to strengthen the bridge between our
&gt; worlds.
&gt;
&gt; So even if you are not religious and do not believe in Jesus Christ
&gt; as I do, these words ring true no matter what context they come from
&gt; this wisdom was spoken by my lord two thousand years ago.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;do not check the splinter in your brothers eye, until you have
&gt; checked the plank in your own&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Truthfully, anything we could do to sway this individuals sale of
&gt; these boxes would be minimal. Negativity and greed always find a
&gt; crack to seep through.
&gt;
&gt; My suggestion is lets try a little harder to spread the word of the
&gt; research and educate individuals that are or may become interested,
&gt; through all the various outlets available to us on the web concerning
&gt; the paranormal research community. There are endless chat boards,
&gt; groups and forums plus websites and word of mouth.
&gt; Instead of trying to stop this idiot from defrauding innocent
&gt; unknowledgable people. Lets make sure the knowledge is out there for
&gt; them and we are here to help them and guy&#x27;s like Mr. ebay will
&gt; disappear on their own.
&gt;
&gt; And we will not have expended an ounce of negative energy in the
&gt; process.
&gt; That&#x27;s how I feel, but that&#x27;s just me.
&gt;
