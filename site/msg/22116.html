=C2=A0 
I ab=

have, it's others that try to take over the "invention", almost claiming it=
 as 
their own, and if you fail to properly kiss his ass, then you get publ=
ically 
insulted and belittled. He's done it with other people besides me, =
recall Joe's 
Box, and the Mini Box. Nothing wosre than someone that uses o=
ther people's work 
to make a name for himself.

Then, all forget there is =
a history to radio voices, it goes back to the first 
invention of radio, i=
n the beginning, it used to be called Direct Radio Voice, 
no one here is i=
nventing anything new. As far as different sweep modes aka 
Random, as far =
as I can tell --useless. As far Edison--no evidence to show he 
made any of=
 this stuff. 


No one gets concept, provide the raw audio and they will ta=
lk. Doesn't matter 
how you make bits of speech, anything will work. 


No =
matter how fancy you make the technology, it turns into a joke when people =

sit in a dark room and ask what color their underwear is, and insist on 
e=
nhancing any fear of spirit communication.

Yeah, I know---who cares--where=
