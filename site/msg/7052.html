<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks all fro listening. I wanted to show that direct mode, or as 
the Mini box works seems to result in clearer voices, even if it&#x27;s 
not amplified.

&gt; A couple voices from just now testign another car tuner. I have 
veryu  few of 
&gt; these, and out of four I had in the junk box, only two work. These 
are  weak, 
&gt; almost like regular EVP. Rigel is one that comes through every once 
in  
&gt; awhile, not sure if that his name, or home, as sometimes he 
says &quot;this is your  
&gt; friend from Rigel&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; It&#x27;s still looking like the sound  chamber is completely un needed, 
and may 
&gt; even hamper the voices. What I get  form the Ghostman, and even 
directly from a 
&gt; tuenr module is easier to  understand that the ones through an 
sound chamber 
&gt; and mic amplifiers. the  Gostman in direct mode yields longs, and 
more 
&gt; coherent voices than the  original box, at least compared to what I 
was getting last 
&gt; night.
&gt; Tonight  I&#x27;ll modifiy #32 to get either direct recordings out of  
the tuner, 
&gt; or through the sound chamber so I can compare.  I had one from 
2/5/08 from the 
&gt; Ghostman that said &quot;that Earthquake will  occur-------I had one 
from 2/5 
&gt; Chile (Falklands?)C  There  was a EQ today off Brazil, but no 
island there.
