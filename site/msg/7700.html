If I'm understanding you correctly, I'd say yes.  Most of the clear 
messages I get through my 469 seem to be more like standard evps - the 
sounds formed from the base energy as opposed to put together from 
separate syllables pulled off the airwaves.

Actually, this gives me an idea.  On the low tech end, I wonder if just 
using humming as a base would give the spirits the energy and 
frequencies they need to form the sounds of language.  I will play with 
this and let you know if that pans out.
