<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi LC,

Yes, it does take a bit more tweaking and adjusting when using the 
chamber; just to get the volume levels set properly to be able to 
hear the raw audio clearly.  My fist sesion ever was with the older 
12-470 in the open air, using a digital recorder.  I got results 
during that one.  I have yet to run a real session (other than some 
testing) with my other configurations.
Maybe later this week sometime.

Thanks for sharing!
- Mike

&gt; Mike, I had an incredible session yesterday with the 12-469 and 
amped 
&gt; speakers.  I have not uploaded the file, yet, but I am ruined.  
Great 
&gt; questioning and answering...very discernable.  It seems when the 
&gt; person operating the device tunes in, the mish mash of audio bits 
&gt; become something else when the spirits start using it.
&gt; 
&gt; As Halliday said, no box needed with these radios.  The box made it 
&gt; difficult to record clearer voices and made things a bit muffled 
for 
&gt; me.  I made an echo chamber and used a sound chamber, but didn&#x27;t 
like 
&gt; it as well.  The amplified speakers seem to give a nice &quot;hiss&quot; 
which 
&gt; fills in the gaps with white noise (?), but that hiss makes it 
&gt; difficult for clarity when dropped in a chamber. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now I am excited to use the 12-470 (older version) without the 
&gt; chambers and with (just to compare, as well).

&gt; &gt; Ahhh... Welcome to the world of 12-470 (older version) 
ownership.  
&gt; I 
&gt; &gt; think you will find it a bit better than the 12-469, in my 
opinion 
&gt; &gt; anyway.  I guess since I own both models... I can say that after 
a 
&gt; &gt; side by side comparison.  You can say goodbye to that AM sweep 
&gt; &gt; clicking found on the 12-469, anyway.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Enjoy your new experimental device... once it arrives!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you.  I had to pay a pretty price for it, but I need it 
for 
&gt; &gt; my 
&gt; &gt; &gt; experiments and there are none left around here.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It appears there is an older 12-470 (hackable version) on 
&gt; ebay.
