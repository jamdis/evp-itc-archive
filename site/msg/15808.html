Here is a little poem by Kipling,  btw I love all my lists,  Bonnie
 
 
_Rudyard  Kipling_ 
(http://www.everypoet.com/archive/poetry/Rudyard_Kipling/kipling_contents.htm) 
If 

If 
If you can keep your head when all about you 
Are losing theirs and  blaming it on you; 
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  
But make allowance for their doubting too; 
If you can wait and not  be tired by waiting, 
Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies, 
Or,  being hated, don't give way to hating, 
And yet don't look too good,  nor talk too wise;  
If you can dream - and not make dreams your master; 
If you can  think - and not make thoughts your aim; 
If you can meet with triumph  and disaster 
And treat those two imposters just the same; 
If you  can bear to hear the truth you've spoken 
Twisted by knaves to make a  trap for fools, 
Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,  
And stoop and build 'em up with wornout tools;  
If you can make one heap of all your winnings 
And risk it on one  turn of pitch-and-toss, 
And lose, and start again at your beginnings  
And never breath a word about your loss; 
If you can force your  heart and nerve and sinew 
To serve your turn long after they are gone,  
And so hold on when there is nothing in you 
Except the Will which  says to them: "Hold on";  
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, 
Or walk with  kings - nor lose the common touch; 
If neither foes nor loving friends  can hurt you; 
If all men count with you, but none too much; 
If you  can fill the unforgiving minute 
With sixty seconds' worth of distance  run - 
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, 
And - which  is more - you'll be a Man my son!

Yep April you are right. Remaining open to the possibility is hard  enough 
for most people. Again its a case of prove or disprove it for  yourself. Not 
everyone comes to the same conclusions or gets the exact  same results. 
Maybe similar but not exact. 
 
I tend to use a variety of methods. When voices come from things  such as 
water or out of thin air sometimes its a easier for some to  believe there is 
something there that they were not aware of.

But again they have to prove it for themselves to be able to have  that eye 
opening moment.
 
I only comment on what I hear or dont hear. My speaker set up is a  bit 
different than most. I hate headphones. Others prefer them. Some use  pc 
speakers. Results vary based on the individual. What I hear you may  not then 
again you just might hear it exactly the same. I dont worry  about that. Just 
keep exploring with an open mind.

To be honest, I am still very  skeptical about the Frank's Box type of 
technology, as I have not  heard anything convincing enough for me personally to 
say  yeah-that is spirit communication. But I do remain open to the  
possibility.
 
But that is my problem not anyone  else's, and this is why I have refrained 
from commenting too much  on anyone's results.

I think it varies depending on who you ask as well as what they  have 
personally experienced. As an example, some people believe in  angels and demons 
others do not. Therefor some may get messages that  correspond to their own 
beliefs as well as the beliefs of those who  are speaking.

Almost every person who does this eventually  develops a theory that may 
change over time based on what they  experience and what their beliefs are. 
Then there are those who  remain undecided or have doubts.

As for me I look at it as  purely educational, a learning experience. Ive 
met many people I  never knew existed. Ive researched topics I'd never even 
considered.  Ive gotten messages and images that are awe inspiring and many  
interesting concepts to ponder and explore.

There are many  glimpses of truth, as well as momentary proof along the way 
that  lead me to develop my own theory and eventually you will develop  
your own too. This research is fascinating and can be quite mind  blowing.

I dont worry what anyone else thinks. I have no need  to prove anything to 
anyone else. They can do that for themselves. I  always say honesty is the 
best policy and if you are honest with  yourself and others the only ones who 
object are those who's lies  arent tolerated. So just look for the truth 
yourself and dont let me  or anyone else tell you what that is. 

It's a great journey  and your path is your own!

Misty

some sort  of reasonable theory I can live with. I know we will never have 
a  true answer, at least not any time soon, but surely those who have  been 
doing this for years and years must have a working theory on  what these 
entities are? Based on their behavior rather than what  they say? Based on 
consistencies from researcher to researcher?  Based on things these entities 
know and don't know (e.g. knew my  dad's friend Gordy was dead, while I did  
not)?
