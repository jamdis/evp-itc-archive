Misty,
 
You are right to a certain extent, I have found in my experience
=
that traditional evp does not lend itself to astral communication.
 
It is =
more for field investigation and capturing grounded spirits.
Personally I f=
eel that each individual is comfortable with their own
style of spirit comm=
unication.  For the new people, The information
I give about box research a=
nd para research in general comes from personal 
of experience.

I agree with some of what Bruce said. But dont go throwing =
out everything you have learned about ITC research it STILL applies no matt=
er what method you are using you are building a bridge of contact. I get al=
