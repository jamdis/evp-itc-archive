<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Laura,

The designs are in the primitive stage, prototype sketch is all. I am
thinking about using wood for the casing and then building a rather
more advanced version is the prototype if it shows promise.

&gt; That&#x27;s great. Do you have a proto type built?
&gt; 
&gt;  I would enjoy testing it for you! 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, please send me your designs would enjoy looking them over.

&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; This is my first post. I was wondering if anyone had created an all in
&gt; one ITC EVP device. I know that researchers such as Seidle had created
&gt; the psychophone that seemed to cover many aspects of ITC but I have
&gt; yet to see all ways of communication in one device.
&gt; 
&gt; I have created an all in one design that covers most of the devices
&gt; used. If you wish I will share the design.
