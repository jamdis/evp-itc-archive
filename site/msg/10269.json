I don&#39;t know much about electronics and that&#39;s why if you read \nmy post from yesterday i referred Kay to ask you about how the box \nworks.  I never claimed to know anymore than the next person, i don&#39;t \nbelieve i have an ego either.  I&#39;m still learning and always trying \nnew things to stay refreshed in what i&#39;m doing here.  I know you no \nlonger like me for whatever reasons you have, but i don&#39;t go bashing \nyou on public forums.  Some call that cheap shots, i only speak about \nyou with respect and will continue to do so.  As a matter of fact, \nyesterday i called myself a dopey box researcher.  Does that sound \nlike i&#39;m above the rest?\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; \n&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Told ya! Let the friggin&#39; entities talk, and you might get \n&gt; something more meaningful, but then that wouldn&#39;t justify the ego \n&gt; crap, and the so called theories, and paranormal expertise.  So \nwhat \n&gt; good is it doing to ask all the &quot;right&quot; questions when you get \nvague \n&gt; junk back!? You have to let go the presumptions, and everything you \n&gt; think you know. \n&gt; \n&gt;  What makes you two(Steve and Bruce) think you are so special that \n&gt; you can get the answers to technology questions when they don&#39;t \neven \n&gt; tell me, Stefan, Bill, Ron, or any physical techs anything! At \nleast \n&gt; we could implement any technical suggestions. Y&#39;all wouldn&#39;t know \n&gt; microfarad from a microbus(VW). \n&gt; \n&gt;  I think your guides quit talking cuz you&#39;re both are ego tripping \n&gt; into outter space. Yet you&#39;re pissed cuz I wouldn&#39;t allow myself to \n&gt; obligated to you for &quot;donations&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt;  I been tryin&#39; to hold back, but this girl&#39;s still got hair trigger!\n&gt; \n&gt;  So &#39;nuff public venting!\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
