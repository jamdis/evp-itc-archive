My name is Suzanne, my husband is Sarge and we&#39;re new to the \n&gt; group.  We recently formed MMPS or MI Metro Paranormal Society.  We \n&gt; have thirteen members and are based in southern lower MI.\n&gt; We&#39;re so happy to have found this group!  My husband is working on our \n&gt; first &#39;box&#39;.  I&#39;m amazed at what I&#39;ve heard and can&#39;t wait to try ours \n&gt; out!  Have a wonderful day everyone :)\n&gt;"}
