Hiya Jill. 
=C2=A0
Most likely most are busy with work, kids going back to =
school, and family from the holidays. No you arent the only one who gets th=
ose types of messages. As for the name thing some do give names and some do=
n't. I have been given full names of those who passed or those who I will l=
ater meet many of which I never heard of until then. I dont think names are=
 quite as important once the physical body it was labeled upon passes on. S=
ome have stated they do not have names or never have been born as we were.

=C2=A0
As for why you dont get the reply you wish for or the magic words...=
. take a look around. This board is a good example of how you dont always g=
et the reponse you wish for or the answers to all of your questions hehehe.=

=C2=A0
Hope you had a great holiday and good luck in the upcoming year!

 Why? Do last names cease to exist on the other side? Or is there some unwr=
