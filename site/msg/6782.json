I am always willing and hopefully able to help new researchers with \nmy=\r\n advice and knowledge I have gained through experience. But my ideology is =\r\nnot the end all explanation or truth of box research\nall opinions here are =\r\nvaluable and deserving of consideration and attention.\n \nAs for your questi=\r\non, the fact that I am blessed enough to receive a fairly good level of com=\r\nmunication I believe is based once \nagain on the relationship I have built =\r\nwith my tech/guides and the synchronization of energy we have developed.\nTh=\r\ne level of communication we are at I believe is only the very tip of the ic=\r\neberg. My goal in &quot;MY&quot; research is to reach a level of communication that \n=\r\nallows us to speak easily and freely with our spirit friends in a fluid and=\r\n continual fashion as if having a pleasant telephone conversation.\n \nThe gi=\r\nst of the messages I am receiving now are directed toward our spirit counte=\r\nrparts achieving the same goal. It is already a comfort to me to know they =\r\nare there and I have had the opportunity to speak with close family members=\r\n and friends that have crossed over. And also recently Ms. Sarah Estep who =\r\nhas made the transition and is beginning to work now on the\nspirit side to =\r\nfurther the communication. Any information I receive from the spirits I rec=\r\nognise to be friends is invaluable. Something as simple as a yes or no answ=\r\ner to a direct question that has just been asked is a small miracle in and =\r\nof itself. considering how it was attained and where it is from. Most resea=\r\nrchers I think after a certain amount of time succumb to the human flaw of =\r\ncomplacency and take for granted that when they turn a box on they will rec=\r\neive communication.

Funny thing is, I recognize Mike and Lisa on your recordings too.  I&#39;m =\r\naware that they are acting as facilitators and guardians, that they are con=\r\nsistent in their ability to use varied modes of communication, and that the=\r\nir contact appears to be purposeful, as compared to so much that seems to h=\r\nave no rhyme or reason.  \n \nAs a newbie I&#39;m admittedly intimidated by and i=\r\nn awe of the results you more experienced researchers are accomplishing.  W=\r\nhat I find most awesome is that everyone can have different methods, belief=\r\n systems and opinions and come together in one forum to share and learn fro=\r\nm one another.  I feel so lucky to have found you!  Bruce, your ability to =\r\nhear and accurately repeat my one posted EVP is the only validation I&#39;ve pe=\r\nrsonally ever received that makes me know I&#39;m involved in something real an=\r\nd life altering.  I&#39;m supposed to be here!  I think a big part of my educat=\r\nion will continue to come from the knowledge and experience you all are wil=\r\nling to keep sharing.  It&#39;s also a fact that each of us needs to find his/h=\r\ner own individual truth.  \n \nI&#39;m still troubled by the possibility that we =\r\ncould be pawns in Someone Else&#39;s science experiment.  I can sense Frank&#39;s c=\r\nynicism related to the messages being meaningless and the messengers being =\r\nuntrustworthy.  In your own case, what is the goal?  Is the fact that you&#39;v=\r\ne established communication and continue to communicate enough?  Are we hop=\r\ning to gain invaluable information from our guides, or just to have the com=\r\nfort of knowing they are there?  \n \nThis is the week I&#39;ve promised myself t=\r\no start doing sessions with the Radio Shack hacks!  \n \nRobin\n \n \n \n \n \nhoog=\r\nroups.com \n\nSent: Sunday, February 03, 2008 6:25 AM\nSubject: RE: [EVP-ITC] =\r\nRe: File from tonight\n\n\nRobin, I agree with Steve on a couple of points. Fi=\r\nrst let me say that Ido believe that we all have a &quot;technician/guide/guardi=\r\nan&quot; call them what youmay. but I usually call them by the names they introd=\r\nuced themselves by. I know for a fact through many, many, many box sessions=\r\n that when I turna box on, could be Frank&#39;s box or the minibox or the RS 47=\r\n0 does not matter which. The same two entities will come through immediatel=\r\ny, So much so now, that I do not even ask for conformation thatit is in fac=\r\nt them. I recognise their individual voice patterns. I have built a solid r=\r\nelationship with these two spiritsI know as mike and Lisa so much so that I=\r\n have even gotten to know their individual personalities. There are other n=\r\newer researchers here that will attest to the fact that when they where doi=\r\nng their first sessionsI had asked my two &quot;Friends&quot; Mike and Lisa to assist=\r\n in getting them started and invariably the spirits that came through to th=\r\nese new researchers during their first sessions identified themselves as Mi=\r\nke and Lisa. Steve says he does not turn on his box and use them as a crutc=\r\nh, that is not entirely true. I had done research very closely with Steve u=\r\nntil recently and I would venture to say that 99% if not every session he s=\r\ntarts with &quot;Mike & Lisaare you available to talk with me&quot;  Also I don&#39;t con=\r\nsider working with my technicians as using them as a crutch, They would not=\r\n allow that.They are not there like butlers at our beckoned call when we fe=\r\nel they may be of some use.Quite the opposite, without them we would get no=\r\n communication at all, they are allowing us the honor of receiving this cel=\r\nestial communication. They are the moderators, facilitators and generators =\r\nof all we hear and send to and from the spirit realm.And they also stand as=\r\n guards and protectors to do the best they can to keep us from being deceiv=\r\ned or taken down a dark path. Some here wait for others to state an opinion=\r\n and then tend to agree with that opinion no matter what they have experien=\r\nced to be true. Robin, my advice to you as a new researcher in this field. =\r\nForm your own beliefs through your experience and research.Listen and learn=\r\n from others but do not let what you believe to be true or not, be swayed b=\r\ny popular opinion.

Technicians i &lt;BR&gt;have fou=\r\nnd were used to get you up and running and i only now call on &lt;BR&gt;them if i=\r\n need assistance. I don&#39;t turn the boxes on and ask for &lt;BR&gt;them like a cru=\r\ntch, i conduct my session and if i need help they will &lt;BR&gt;supply it to me =\r\nif needed. I think the whole idea is to find out who &lt;BR&gt;we are communicati=\r\nng with, maybe we will never really know for sure &lt;BR&gt;but i still try and f=\r\nind out as best as i can. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-Steve H.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A title=3Dmailto=\r\n:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@ya=\r\nhoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Robin Searcy Henson&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;MudPuddleFarm@&lt;WBR&gt;..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Hi Frank, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When you mention b=\r\neing distrustful of what comes through the boxes, &lt;BR&gt;are you saying you&#39;re=\r\n skeptical of the &quot;technicians&quot; being who they &lt;BR&gt;say they are?
