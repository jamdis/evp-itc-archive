It plugs into the earphone jack of your sound  \ndevice, and has fairly decent sound for something so small and cheap.  \nThey had about 4 or 5, I bet other BB&B stores would have them. Photo  \nattached below. Its a Spi Mini Hi-Fi Speaker, they had black or white,  \nfor $4.99 (half price). It takes 2 AAA batteries. Works great with my  \nnew RS 12-470.\n\nDeb T"}
