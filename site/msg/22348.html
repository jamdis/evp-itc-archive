<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Welcome, Ron. It gets that way once in a while here. Actually, it&#x27;s been
pretty laid-back lately. Just realize some people are often tongue-in-cheek
and don&#x27;t get too serious about anything anyone says. Sometimes it almost
seems like we&#x27;re a big extended family here.
