I know what you mean Misty -=
 it does seem that interpretations are often varied.=A0 I am thinking that =
the best way to make progress is to get an audio sample that you think is m=
ost representative of a given approach's effectiveness, and send that priva=
tely to several people.=A0 Name the file something innocuous (like File1) a=
nd don';t tell the people you send it to what you think you hear.=A0 Also, =
ask the people not to discuss the file with anyone else, and have them send=
 what they think they hear directly back to you,rather than posting the res=
ults in a forum or group.

I think that kind of test is helpful, since it s=
eems to me that once someone tells me what the audio clip sounds like, then=
 it's hard for me to hear anything else in it.=A0 But,that could be influen=
cing my interpretation (like someone pointing to a cloud, telling me its a =
horse, and then I have trouble NOT seeing a horse) ,so it's better to liste=
n before it is suggested to me what i should be hearing.

This way, I think=
 the most progress can be made, because if people just keep confirming what=
 we think we hear, and it turns out it's just noise that we are forcing an =
interpretation into, we won't be making progress (though it might make us f=
eel good to believe that we're being successful).=A0 Getting negative feedb=
ack to one's approach is not as fun, and might feel like some non-believer =
is trying to debunk us.=A0 But, really, that can be the best feedback for p=
rogress, since it helps us to change tactics when our current approach is n=
ot effective, rather than continuing down an ineffective path, getting acco=
lades from friends, but missing out on other paths that might show more pro=
mise,.

Thanks RJ

I never know who will hear what. No matter which method is us=
ed. Everyone hears differently, different speaker setups, different softwar=

times the one thats not one I think of as clear is the one everyone agrees =
