<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi All, Thanks to those here on helping me understand How To Do a sweep recording with a radio (AM mostly)! Last night I finally was able to do it correctly as when I carefully listened back with headphones I heard: YOU ARE STONED, FOR . . . YOU (which sounded like Tiny Tim singing it!?), THE FIRST TIME . . . FOR YOU, then on FM, when I asked, &quot;Is anybody here?&quot; I heard: SHUT . . .UP! LOL  Probably that one was a &quot;Darkie&quot;! Most of the EVP&#x27;s/voice messages seemed to be OK and not negative = which is good. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing a lot as they tend to go by too fast and my ears are not used to it, yet! I have the time, daily to do the experimental research on this and hope to continue recording &amp; making notes! Tune in, same time, same station (AM) as they used to say!  Thanks.  =Judy=    P.S. I like the sterio idea &amp; smaller boxes!</pre>
