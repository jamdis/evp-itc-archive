This file i got in the first 8 seconds of the recording.  Pretty funny that they know Bruce and I before we even say anything.  I was alone during this recording, but bruce and i do a lot of sessions on Skype.  So, they probablt thought we were both there during the recording today. \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Simple%20FM%20Sweep%20Radio%20Design/how_you_doin%27--bruce_and_steve.mp3 \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/help/us/groups/files\n\nRegards,\n\nurkel232002 &lt;urkel23@...&gt;"}
