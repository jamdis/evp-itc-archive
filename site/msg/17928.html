Very good example of my points:
More 'personal' claims. 
More attacks on th=
e person with a different opinion (hard hearted, close minded, etc)
And sti=
ll, no addressing the problems of lack of credible evidence.
The problem th=
at noise can 'sound like something', but that doesn't make it from spirits.=

The problem of claims of predictions, but no predictions.

Nicely done.
