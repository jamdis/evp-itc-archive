<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>YES. Actually, getting the flash as far away from the lens as possible
plus either bouncing it off the ceiling or using a diffuser will
almost eliminate dust orbs. A speedlite flash is well worth the $$. 

To make this a little more on topic, I have a 469 radio shack hack
unit. I&#x27;ve tried it a few times and haven&#x27;t received any messages at
all yet. I&#x27;ve even tried just letting it run for a while while I&#x27;m
doing other things and haven&#x27;t gotten anything. I guess there isn&#x27;t
anyone around who wants to talk to me :( Do you know of anything I can
do to try to drum up some conversation?

&gt; Hi Elabeth,
&gt; 
&gt; Have you found that using the diffuser helps to eliminate dust orbs?
 I&#x27;ve 
&gt; been using the built-in flash on my D70S but think it&#x27;s about time
to get 
&gt; one of the Nikon speedlights to go with it.
