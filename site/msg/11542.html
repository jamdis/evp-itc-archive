<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Andrea,
I have experienced this before.  In my case it had to do with a spirit
that attached itself to us while at Waverly.  It became very strong, and I
had to have assistance to rid my home of him.  We also experienced very
dense, black masses moving towards us.

&gt; Hi Andrea,
&gt;
&gt; Sounds like a vortex may have been opening up in your hallway.  Have  you
&gt; had
&gt; any paranormal ativity in your house before?

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; I am Andrea Carr who is a 41 year old wife and  mom of 1 daughter. I am
&gt; sorry
&gt; I have not written before but I have a terrible  year and haven&#x27;t had the
&gt; time to concentrate on EVP like I had prior. I won&#x27;t  get into the details
&gt; but it
&gt; has left me in the midst of OK just trying to pull  through all of this BS
&gt; &amp;
&gt; I will get back to it when I  can.
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunatley I am leaving for the weekend  tomorrow morning and won&#x27;t see
&gt; my
&gt; e-mails until Monday morning.
&gt;
&gt; I have a question for any one here. I believe in  aliens, spirit and ghost
&gt; communications via evp but tonight I had an  experience I never had
&gt; before.
&gt;
&gt; I woke up at exactly 2:22 by my stove&#x27;s clock and  went and cleaned my
&gt; sink
&gt; of dishes while I heated up some cream chipped beef  (albiet not too
&gt; exciting)
&gt; but while I sat there after in the dark with my  family sleeping my
&gt; hallway
&gt; ilummating a light clored blue several times.  Anyone else ever seen this?
&gt;
&gt; I look forward to any responses.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Andrea
&gt;
