<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s always questionable when dealing with paranormal. In this it seems like misinformation is a past time but with this being on a fairly large scale across the ITC world. 

I&#x27;ve got pretty much nothing myself that meshes with anything anyone else has though other than stay out of it ... etc etc.. but I do keep trying.

&gt;  Yeah, I don&#x27;t know what to make of the predictiosn either, but it seems
&gt; everyone that asks gets the same answers.  If we were asking anything else
&gt; the answers would be taken as evidence, but with predictions it&#x27;s not
&gt; believed. Doesn&#x27;t that make all information obtained via EVP questionable?
