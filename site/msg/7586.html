Just found this about your new box.  Looks and sounds promising.  But I suppose in my Land-of-Weak-Signals I would get nothing.  On the other hand, I almost feel I would sacrafice a volume of sessions and signals for good, clear, multi-word messages.  I am getting EVP block because I am afraid I will get nothing during a session or, worse yet, I may be getting messages but I cannot hear or understand them...if you get my drift.  Good stuff at your end.  Ron L

I am testing that scans to strong signals only on the FM band, with 
scan rate and range adjustments. This method is different sounding, 
being somewhat choppy, but may yield clearer audio. The downside, as I 
have been discussing elsewhere, may be the lack of weaker signals 
between, and less white noise to be utilized. I'll keep working with 
it and post my results as I have them. If spirits can manipulate 
audio, then this method may have merit, too. ;)
