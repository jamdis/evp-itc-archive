<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t know why random is clearer, unless they have the raw audio, but
don&#x27;t have it on continuously so it interference with their speech(?) Back
when I first started and there was sunspots the voices were amazingly clear.

&gt; communication, just not as clearly.
&gt;
&gt; Do you have any opinions on why you think random works better with your
&gt; boxes?
&gt;
&gt; I hear the first two messages. For the message at .11, I could not make out
&gt; the first part but the second part sounds like &quot;Fuck the people,&quot; not &quot;for
&gt; the people.&quot;  I did not hear anything in the last one.

&gt;&gt;  I send this type of box out and invariably I hear back &quot;that doesn&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; work!&quot; This is single supply random mode, seems to work here! Starts out
&gt;&gt; &quot;--be good&quot;, at 4 seconds &quot;This is to calm Chris down&quot;, at 11 seconds &quot;this
&gt;&gt; is recorded for the people&quot;, and at the end &quot;the girl is seventeen&quot; --I get
&gt;&gt; that alot, and I don&#x27;t why it is important. &quot;They&quot; claim the &quot;princess&quot; was
&gt;&gt; kidnapped, it&#x27;s the one thing I do remember, and at the same age she was,
&gt;&gt; 17,  I actually relived the event, so maybe it&#x27;s for validation. I don&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; believe in living in the past,  reliving past traumas, or grieving.
&gt;&gt;  I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m still uncertain if random has an advantage, the
&gt;&gt; messages seem longer and in a more natural sounding voice.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Single supply random takes some finessing to make it work, so I prefer to
&gt;&gt; use dual supplies. + and - 12 volts.===more batteries==more $$$ to operate.
