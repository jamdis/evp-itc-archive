<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>&gt;  Y&#x27;all have to keep in mind, we come from spirit, and return to spirit, so why make the communication all magical, mysterious and scary?
&gt;  Frank-S


Trying to communicate without asking questions seems to me to be making it all magical and mysterious.  Asking questions is the most natural way to find out something from someone.

&gt; &gt;  Just adding: thats exactly how it works. When we contact a spirit or see
&gt; &gt; one they wont talk &quot;unless&quot; a question is asked. Then they will speak or
&gt; &gt; send a picture or noise or whatever.
&gt; &gt; Talking to spirits is a series of questions. One you notice that you have
&gt; &gt; the ability, then people just look at it awhile, then it hits them to ask
&gt; &gt; questions and then they find that the spirits answer things too. :) The box
&gt; &gt; is a tool to bring the conversations on the outside of your head. Its a big
&gt; &gt; deal. How did this first get thought of, Frank? How did Frank get the idea
&gt; &gt; to ask it questions? That is what mediumship is all about.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My son has built one of the boxes. I am trying to get him on here because
&gt; &gt; he will do the work for me of building them. I help a little from having 6
&gt; &gt; months of electronics too. This is really going to go far. This is a brave
&gt; &gt; new adventure and I am happy to be here.
&gt; &gt; Thank you
&gt; &gt; San

&gt; &gt; Well, I consider myself a &quot;Psychic&quot; too I use a &quot;monitor Technique not
&gt; &gt; unlike the CIA was said to employ (I discovered it on my own and later read
&gt; &gt; that the CIA was using a similar method) I use a &quot;monitor&quot; or person to ask
&gt; &gt; questions and I find I can reply psychically It involves not using the
&gt; &gt; &quot;questioning/judgemental&quot; part of my brain and staying in the &quot;declaritive
&gt; &gt; mode&quot;--somehow THAT holds the psychic &quot;conduit&quot; open and I can function as a
&gt; &gt; medium. The monitor person asks the questions and the replies come. Should I
&gt; &gt; ask the question myself, however, the conduit shuts. It IS interesting
&gt; &gt; though, I can ask questions indirectly, staying in declaritive mode, by
&gt; &gt; saying to my monitor something like &quot;ask me to look at the flag or ask me
&gt; &gt; what color is his coat---The monitor asks and THEN I get my answer--I stay
&gt; &gt; concious, but with a slight &quot;buzz&quot; and often the info does not go to my long
&gt; &gt; term mem ory.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My suggestions on how the boxes work are based on my own years of
&gt; &gt; experience with random viewing fields. once it became obvious how THEY
&gt; &gt; worked, it was a simple thing to see the correspondence with audio factor in
&gt; &gt; boxes. One thing the boxes have taught me, however, is that it is NOT &quot;all
&gt; &gt; in the head&quot; as these sound files can be shared with others.---This is
&gt; &gt; making me rethink that my VIDEO random feild stuff may also not be &quot;in the
&gt; &gt; head, and perhaps may be captured on imagery.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You&#x27;re making alot of presumptuous statements that have no basis in fact.
&gt; &gt; &gt; You&#x27;re just jealous cuz you can&#x27;t hear the boxes. I don&#x27;t need any noise
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; hear spirits, and I do just fine seeing through the third eye. It&#x27;s just
&gt; &gt; &gt; that same old skeptic BS that it&#x27;s all in the brain.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The random sounds make it easier to hear spirit voices in your head. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discovered this effect VISUALLY staining at rsndom dots on a viewing
&gt; &gt; screen.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the visual mode the spirit only has to suppress the light spots and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enhance the dark spots that do not match the image it is
&gt; &gt; sending----Light
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and dark spots on the screen that correspond to the image dont have to
&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; modulated at all---the result is a SAVING of &quot;psychic energy&quot; on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observers part, perhaps not much, but enough to make the difference
&gt; &gt; between
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seeing and NOT seeing, however. Random sound would work the same way
&gt; &gt; only
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the frequencies that did not match the sounds being sent would have to
&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blocked or replaced, the frequencies already present would NOT have to
&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; modulated--so SOME energy is saved and not as much effort is needed to
&gt; &gt; hear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the entity. Effectively enhancing one&#x27;s innate abilities. It a lot
&gt; &gt; easier to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hear a spirit sound if some of the waves are already in place, than it
&gt; &gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be if you had to build the entire word from scratch.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That doesn&#x27;t surprise me at all. I wish someone could figure out why
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using the box enhances one&#x27;s abilities as a medium, but apparently this
&gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so -- I know it was true for me. As much experience as you have, Frank,
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would seem to follow you&#x27;d have built up some considerable ability.
