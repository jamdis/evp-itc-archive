<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ahh yeah this pc&#x27;s video aint the greatest either. Its good for basic 
things but will need a new hd soon. Bought the new one because  
figured I worked hard enough all year I deserve a newer one hehehe 
plus the price was too good to resist.

&gt; &gt; No charge at all unless you own land or rent. You can
&gt; &gt; purchase 
&gt; &gt; different avatars, clothing, accessories, etc...
&gt; &gt; for your avatar. Second Life currency is called
&gt; &gt; &quot;Lindens&quot;. You can by 
&gt; &gt; quite a lot of lindens for a couple of bucks via Paypal.
&gt; &gt; You can also get many avatars and clothes, costumes, you
&gt; &gt; name it, for 
&gt; &gt; free. There are a lot of &quot;freebie&quot; type places on
&gt; &gt; SL.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For a long time, I got everything free and had a lot of fun
&gt; &gt; playing 
&gt; &gt; with my avatar. You can get pretty creative. I once saw
&gt; &gt; Jesus float by 
&gt; &gt; and angels were singing around him - it was a riot - and
&gt; &gt; later saw a 
&gt; &gt; very strange looking Elvis. You can be anything in SL.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Many different spiritual &amp; metaphysical groups meet in
&gt; &gt; SL. They have 
&gt; &gt; places to meditate, talk, you name it. It&#x27;s a lot of
&gt; &gt; fun to explore.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For a recording group, I was envisioning meeting once or
&gt; &gt; twice a month 
&gt; &gt; (or more) to discuss our research and perhaps even try to
&gt; &gt; record as a 
&gt; &gt; group... combine energies. Might be fun &amp; interesting!

&gt; &gt; &gt; w. I checked out the site quickly. Looks like a
&gt; &gt; monthly charge is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; involved or no? I will get back to it again when I
&gt; &gt; have more time. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you envision with a recording group...I might
&gt; &gt; be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; interested? ron l
