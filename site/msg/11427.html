LOL! Why dont they just give the winning lotto numbers that would be 
easier to aquire =)

Personally I never seek to prove this to anyone, they should 
prove/disprove it themselves. Even amongst those who arent skeptics, 
hearing varies. Sometimes everyones hears the same sometimes they 
dont. 

I also dont ask about lotto numbers LOL I dont play it.

As for building one yourself, most are trying out the radio 
modifications like the 12-470 or the 12-469 (horrible clicking on the 
469 model but a few have gotten around it. Theres a few others Frank 
and Steve have messed with. I think ones the 12-125 but I am a bit 
tired so all the model numbers arent popping in my head at the moment.

A few &quot;how to&quot; videos have been posted on youtube. You can type in 
the model numbers to access a few of Mike Colletta&#x27;s (ufogeek)
available posts as well as several others who have made thier video 
instructions available online. 

I did try out a fan test session the other day. Tho they werent as 
loud as with water, I could still discern a few statements. They were 
so &quot;bass&quot; in tone that its almost out of my hearing range on a few so 
I didnt post them all. As for the ones I did they can be found on my 
esnips

That should take ya to the right folder

&gt; Hi everyone, 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m sure lots of you know who James Randi is, the skeptic who 
offers $1 
&gt; million for proof of the paranormal. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am wondering why there hasn&#x27;t been an EVP demonstration good 
enough 
&gt; to win the prize. I have never captured an EVP, but many people 
have 
&gt; including those in this group. I cannot say (like James Randi 
&gt; apparently and others like him) that I think every person who 
captured 
&gt; an EVP is a fraud or captured a fluke or something like that. I 
don&#x27;t 
&gt; think that at all, it appears to me that many of them are the real 
&gt; deal, of that I am almost 100% certain and will be 100% certain if 
I 
&gt; can ever capture my own. 
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t know a lot about James Randi or EVP for that matter, but it 
is 
&gt; a question that came up. Can anyone enlighten me? 
&gt; 
&gt; I tried a few sessions last night but came up empty handed. I am 
&gt; starting to think my white noise isn&#x27;t loud enough. I&#x27;m going to 
keep 
&gt; trying. 
&gt; 
&gt; Also I hope to experiment with ITC images. And soon I want to build 
&gt; a &quot;box&quot; which I keep hearing so much about. I don&#x27;t know the first 
&gt; thing about these ghost/spirit boxes as I&#x27;ve heard them called, all 
I 
&gt; know is I want to learn to build one and use it as I&#x27;ve heard some 
&gt; interesting audio files here. But that&#x27;s probably a good subject 
for a 
&gt; separate post unless anyone can give me an informative how-to link 
or 
&gt; anything. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Angela
