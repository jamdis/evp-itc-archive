<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am open to any ideas. I am just trying to figure out the best way 
to list just the hack information.

&gt; Hi Kay.  I think it should be a brief description on how to do all 
the hacks.
&gt; 
&gt; 12-469 old
&gt; 12-469 current
&gt; 12-470 old
&gt; 12-820 current
&gt; 20-125 current
&gt; 
&gt; Did I miss any?  For a $1 listing fee, and no hassles of buying 
product in advance then 
&gt; having to ship, that would be totally worth it.  Unlimited 
downloads (for how long can you 
&gt; list - 9 days?) would reach a heck of a lot more people than 
selling units at cost.  :-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; I checked to see what it would cost to sell one of ebay. To 
list 
&gt; &gt; it 
&gt; &gt; &gt; it is $1.00 for $25.00-449.00 plus 8.75% of the initial $25.00 
&gt; &gt; &gt; ($2.19), plus 3.50% of the remaining closing value balance 
($25.01 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to $1,000.00)
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would be willing to list the one I have plus give the 
&gt; &gt; information 
&gt; &gt; &gt; on the free hacking and that fact that you can get one at 
Radio 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Shack for $24.99 just to shut this guy down. At the most I 
would 
&gt; &gt; be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; out $1.00 to not sell it!!!! Well worth it I&#x27;d say.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Can someone send me the written instructions on how to hack 
the 12-
&gt; &gt; &gt; 249.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Either that, or anyone willing to make them for $25 + 
shipping 
&gt; &gt; &gt; with 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no profit?  You could then list them just like the ones that 
are 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; selling...so they pull up identical to the listings that are 
up 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there.  :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was thinking if someone would list a FREE DOWNLOAD of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instructions for the various hacks 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the Radio Shack units, it could put an end to the 
business 
&gt; &gt; &gt; for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sellers that are taking 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advantage of people who are unaware that they could 
probably 
&gt; &gt; &gt; hack 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the units for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen &quot;downloads&quot; of various things listed before.  
Why 
&gt; &gt; &gt; not 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this?
