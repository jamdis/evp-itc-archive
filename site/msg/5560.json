I&#39;m someone who prays and meditates often, but I\n&gt; wonder if bad spirits are capable of disregarding the boundaries we set\n&gt; for them.  I do know that when I told my threatening EVPer to go back\n&gt; outside it worked; in fact, I haven&#39;t been able to record ANY EVP in my\n&gt; house since then.  I&#39;ve never gotten the cursing so many people describe.\n&gt; Besides having a bad mouth, did the Waverly entity do other things?\n&gt;\n&gt; Robin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: Carol B.&lt;mailto:cbreck@...&gt;\n&gt;   To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, January 15, 2008 2:41 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: PROTECTION RITUAL FILE POSTED\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Robin...\n&gt;   I never use protection...and have had a problem with a spirit that came\n&gt;   home with us from Waverly. He&#39;s gone now, with the help of a great\n&gt;   individual. I have evp&#39;s of this entity saying horrible things. I think\n&gt;   I may start using protection now...\n&gt;\n&gt;   Carol B.\n&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; As someone who has never used a protection ritual (even though I\n&gt; consider\n&gt;   &gt; myself a very spiritual person), I&#39;m not sure I understand what the\n&gt; ritual\n&gt;   &gt; is intended to protect the person invoking it from. I&#39;m not being a\n&gt; smart\n&gt;   &gt; ass; I&#39;m simply trying to learn. Can we be hurt physically or\n&gt; psychically\n&gt;   &gt; by certain spirits, or can our experimentation open a dark portal\n&gt; that&#39;s\n&gt;   &gt; not meant to be opened? My instinct has always been that if I don&#39;t\n&gt;   &gt; acknowledge evil it can have no power over me, but perhaps that&#39;s\n&gt;   &gt; ignorant. I once invited spirits into my house from outside and\n&gt;   &gt; immediately recorded a negative EVP while heating a cup of coffee in\n&gt; the\n&gt;   &gt; microwave. I was too ecstatic to be frightened by the message, but\n&gt; since\n&gt;   &gt; then I&#39;ve wondered what kind of spirit would want to say such a thing\n&gt; to\n&gt;   &gt; me and if I should be more cautious in the future. I would love some\n&gt;   &gt; feedback on this recording.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Robin\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   &gt; From: Frank\n&gt; Sumption&lt;mailto:franks-boxes@...&lt;mailto:franks-boxes%40hotmail.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; To:\n&gt; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Sent: Sunday, January 13, 2008 8:09 PM\n&gt;   &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: PROTECTION RITUAL FILE POSTED\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Bad idea! In my opinion. You just create fear with that crap, and\n&gt;   &gt; fear feeds itself. Once again, you will create what you expect to\n&gt;   &gt; get. If you use protection BS, you&#39;ll have convinced yourself that\n&gt;   &gt; there is something to be affraid of, and so you will tend to creat a\n&gt;   &gt; thoughtform to fulfill that expectation.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Frank-S\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; --- In\n&gt; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt;   &gt; &quot;bhali333&quot;\n&gt;   &gt; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; everyone,\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; I have written up the short protection ritual I use before every\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; session, I have been using it for quite a while now and have had no\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; problems with dark heads other than the occasional curse word.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; I recommend that all researchers experienced and new use this or a\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; similar protection ritual before every box session if you are not\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; already.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; hey it&#39;s better to have it and not need it , than need it and not\n&gt;   &gt; have\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; it!\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; I will post it in the files section in a folder marked\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &quot;protection ritual&quot;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; Thanks guy&#39;s\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt;   &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
