<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi everyone,

 I have been hearing the word &quot; Purple &quot; alot lately in my sessions.
Does anyone in the group know what it pertains to ? It&#x27;s been bugging 
me alot. Could that be a special group on their side ? I have no clue. 
Also has anyone questioned the voices if they have a last name ? All I 
hear on the RS boxes are first names and haven&#x27;t recieved anyone 
telling me their last name. Does Mike and Lisa have a last name ? Did 
anyone here ever ask the question &quot; Are you Demonic Spirits ? &quot; What 
was their reply if any ? I did one time and got a response saying &quot; 
All of us are &quot;. Don&#x27;t know whether I believe that Spirit or not. 
Probably a Joker saying that. I have asked for specific people for 
them to find so I could talk to and got an answer &quot; We&#x27;re looking. &quot; 
Then I never heard from them after that. I&#x27;m still waiting to be 
contacted by Telephone so far nothing yet. They make me laugh 
sometimes. I had the RS-12-469 on the one day I was just listening to 
what they were chatting about. I found my daughters old Fart Machine 
and was playing with it while the RS radio was running to see if it 
still works which it did. All of a sudden after I made it &quot; Toot &quot; I 
heard a female voice say &quot; Phew !!! .&quot;
LOL, I guess she thought I really passed one. Also, the other day I 
was on the RS 12-469 and I said &quot; Hello Lisa how are you doing 
today ? &quot; Then a few seconds later I hear a female voice say &quot; 
Bruce ? &quot; like she thought that I was Bruce talking to her. I told her 
no it&#x27;s me Ralph from Harrisburg,PA she replied &quot;Oh, okay fine. &quot; I 
hear all the time voices calling for Lisa she must be a very Popular 
Technician. Oh well I guess it was more than one question LOL. Hey you 
all take care and &quot; Keep the Sweep &quot; a new slogan for here LOL. just 
kidding. You all have a great day.

Regards,

Ralph the Ghost Hunter</pre>
