But full fledged researchers. Of \ncourse they have much to learn, but so do we all.\n\nWhich brings me to my suggestion.\nSteve and I have recently been discussing the point we have reached \nin the research, both in process and knowledge. We agreed on most \npoints,\nthe most important one being. It is time to move beyond the same \nmundane session content and the same rudimentary line of questioning.\n\nThis research is stagnating for lack of direction, any posted files \nor discussions revolve around the same stale subjects such as, \n&quot;Is there anyone there that wishes to communicate&quot; , \n&quot;What is your name&quot;\n&quot;who am I speaking with&quot;\n&quot;what is it like where you are&quot;\n\nI believe we have all received every combination of answer to those \nquestions that we possibly can, yet we continue to ask them session \nafter session. And still become amazed at a yes or no answer or the \nsimplest of phrases.\n\nI am not saying this about any single level of researcher but all of \nus myself included have fallen into this rut. We are not learning \nanything, All our efforts are amounting to nothing.\n\nWe already know that we are communicating with someone or something. \nI believe we have all come to believe that through our personal \nresearch and the evidence presented by all of us.\n\nWithin the last year the technology and potential of this type of \nresearch has exceeded all expectations in it&#39;s quality and speed of \ndevelopment. We are actually letting it go to waste.\n\nI and a few other researchers believe that whoever is on the other \nside of the line has had a hand in some of us developing this new \nequipment and methods of research be it obvious or subtle.\n\nBut our methods of research have not excelled, we are conducting \nresearch in the same manner as we did when there where only about 5 \nof us in the whole world actively doing this research.\n\nNew individuals are joining our ranks and becoming interested in box \nresearch every day. The protocol they are being instructed to use is \nantiquated and obsolete.\n\nIt is fine to teach them these methods as a basic foundation of the \nresearch and to get their feet wet. But like any other education \nprocess it must evolve and develop with the accumulation of knowledge.\n\nIf we approached academic education the way we approach box research, \nwe would all still be in the first grade.\n\nI propose a committee to develop a method of research and protocol \nthat can deal with the ever evolving technology and decide what and \nhow we should approach the type of communication we seek and the \nsubject matter that should be addressed, that will be continually \nchanging.\n\nOnly in this way will the wheels of research and learning move \nforward and we will gain the knowledge we seek and hopefully be able \nto share it with the world someday.\n\nBut if we continue to ask &quot;Is anyone there willing to speak with me&quot;\nWe are doomed.\n\nAnyone that wishes to discuss this and give opinions or suggestions\nplease lets try and get started every minute we waste is a missed \nopportunity for learning.\n\nBruce\n\n    \n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
