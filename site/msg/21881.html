<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>From a Honda car tuner, manual sweep, and it&#x27;s directly off the tuner&#x27;s
audio output. @34 seconds &quot;Some people think it&#x27;s not normal&quot;. The buzzing
sound is from my overhead light, the dead spots are cuz I had no way to
listen as I recorded.

 Yeah, I can figure this stuff out when no one--it seems--in the world can,
and yet some think I am so retarded to believe anything the box says, such
as the warning of wormwood.  Fact is, I don&#x27;t know if that stuff is true, so
am I not supposed to post it cuz I presumably know better? That would be way
over the top arrogant and egotistical.

F-S
