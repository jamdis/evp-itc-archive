Yes I am another day older. Ive been ill so didnt get to go out of town for my b-day like I hoped so instead I stayed home, rested, and got a few audio sessions in.
   
  They been mentioning my birthday for months and I told them do something different like sing it to me or whatever. I got nothin. Not one more mention of it. Til it became hours before my b-day LOL. Still no singing but other messages of interest including this one.
   
  The only reason I even thought to look at chinese language is because it reminded me of something one of our exchange students at work said to me in her language when it was someone elses birthday last month. I looked it up and it didnt match exactly but was very close. I saw that the chinese language is comprised of many languages including cantonese, which did closely match the evp I recieved as well as the phrase she tried to teach me last month. Took me a while to figure it out tho.
   
  I dont know why they enjoy doing this they know I have a hard enough time trying to decipher english LOL
   
  Anyways here it is and if anyone speaks cantonese I'd enjoy knowing if its pronounced correctly or with an accent LOL because I cant tell and I doubt I'd even try and explain any of this to the girls at work. 
   
  I am also throwing in a couple others. If there werent so many fuzzy ones I'd post em all. Theres a bunch. I may add a few to another email later if anyones able to hear these. There were many about being able to communicate and make contact and others of more personal interest. I guess I had been a little worried that earthly/physical issues would still cloud the connection but they let me know over and over "we are able to make contact" and "your hearing us again". They also mentioned "you have not yet listened to communications and I realized I had accidentally skipped analyzing a file session LOL
   
  Theres a couple more spirit name ones, Ed Anderson...dunno them. And Otto being mentioned as working on something there. I get his name alot. Tho when I saved it to mp3 and replayed it today it sounds more like Autumn than Otto. Adding those even tho they are very hard to hear/fuzzy.
