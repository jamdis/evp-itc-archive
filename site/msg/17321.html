<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

Well, I&#x27;ll still be hoping... and watching things like composite Z-scores at the EGG project.  After all, the dates could refer to something in their world, not ours, but still show up here as energy anomalies... if we know where to look.

Checking last year&#x27;s EGG composite numbers, I see a notable drop between August 14th (7 spikes) and 15th (7 spikes), and the 16th (4 spikes) and the 17th (3 spikes).

That doesn&#x27;t mean anything, of course, but it&#x27;s something that I check now &amp; then. (I&#x27;d have a better sense of the significance if  August&#x27;s monthly graph was available, but that file is showing no data right now.)

On May 7th of this year, there was a significant dip (6 spikes on the 6th, 2 on the 7th, then 6 on the 8th).  But, it was one of three similar dips this month.  I&#x27;m not sure that they correlate to anything geopolitical.

There may come a time when the puzzle pieces fit together.  Until then, I feel a little color-blind trying to figure which piece goes where, and which aren&#x27;t even part of the puzzle I&#x27;m studying!

Cheerfully,
Fiona

&gt;  I&#x27;ve gotten dates before, and nothing happens. It&#x27;s a non-specific
&gt; rpediction, so it doesn&#x27;t mean much. We had August 15th last year, nothing,
&gt; and I had May 7th, this year, nothin&#x27;. someday something will happen on one
&gt; of these dates and we&#x27;ll have our proof ;-0
