We&#39;ll see if it gets approved:\n&gt; \n&gt; I was skeptical about the various radio sweep methods out there, until I tried them for \n&gt; myself.  While this method is especially vulnerable to &#39;false positives&#39;, I observed a \nnumber \n&gt; of  phenomena which couldn&#39;t easily be explained:\n&gt; \n&gt; * The spoken response phrase is directly relevant to my proceeding question or \ncomment, \n&gt; and in some cases it was immediate, just as it would be in a normal conversation.\n&gt; * The duration of the phrase lasts for several seconds, far longer than what could have \n&gt; come from a single broadcasting station.\n&gt; * The words are spoken in a single tone of voice, thereby ruling out that it was simply a \n&gt; fortuitous assembly of broadcast fragments.\n&gt; * The intonation and cadence are suggestive of normal human speech patterns.\n&gt; * Multiple people agree upon the proposed interpretation of the response.\n&gt; * In several instances, the voice has been identified by a loved on as being &quot;just like&quot; \nthat \n&gt; of the person when here in the physical.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I realize the last item in my list is subjective, but when combined with the other \n&gt; observations, it believe it makes an overall persuasive argument for the validity of the \n&gt; various techniques that fall in the radio sweep family.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps a little experimenting of your own would have you feeling differently?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@...m, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi LK.  I used to want to educate people like this, but have somewhat reached a point \n&gt; &gt; where I feel it&#39;s not worth the time and effort.  Perhaps though, I will shoot her over \nthe \n&gt; &gt; article I wrote on radio sweep.  It was included in the most recent AAEVP news journal \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; seemed to be received well, even by those previously unopen to the idea of the \nvalidity \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; this technique.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Margaret\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Laura Kimberley &lt;ghuny1@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Guys, here&#39;s a site I thought you all would be interested in...this site is dogging \nthe \n&gt; &gt; works being done.
