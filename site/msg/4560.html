<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bill,

The PC thing to say is.. &quot;I like them all just the same, and use them 
equally&quot;.  Now none of them will get to jealous over another.
Actually the one I have spent the most time with is the Micro Box, 
since I keep adding more things to it.
I do fancy the RSH 12-470 though... it&#x27;s my favorite... but please 
don&#x27;t tell the others.
It&#x27;s easy to carry around, has a built in speaker, and does not have 
that clicking when sweeping.
Although I have not had the opportunity to use any of them as much as 
I&#x27;d like, but maybe in the coming year I will have more chances to 
dabble.
Plus.. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be adding more things to the Micro Box, as long 
as there is still room to stuff components and wires.

Happy Holidays!
- Mike

&gt; What a nice assortment of gear. Although we shouldn&#x27;t pick favorite 
&gt; babies, care to name if any of these are your most often used and 
&gt; why? Thanks and Happy Holidays Mike. -Bill

&gt; &gt; Maybe I&#x27;ll use this picture for next year&#x27;s Christmas card.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Each one of these I have either designed and built, or hacked and 
&gt; &gt; assembled. Check em out...
