As an example, some people believe in  angels and demons \nothers do not. Therefor some may get messages that  correspond to their own \nbeliefs as well as the beliefs of those who  are speaking.\n\nAlmost every person who does this eventually  develops a theory that may \nchange over time based on what they  experience and what their beliefs are. \nThen there are those who  remain undecided or have doubts.\n\nAs for me I look at it as  purely educational, a learning experience. Ive \nmet many people I  never knew existed. Ive researched topics I&#39;d never even \nconsidered.  Ive gotten messages and images that are awe inspiring and many  \ninteresting concepts to ponder and explore.\n\nThere are many  glimpses of truth, as well as momentary proof along the way \nthat  lead me to develop my own theory and eventually you will develop  \nyour own too. This research is fascinating and can be quite mind  blowing.\n\nI dont worry what anyone else thinks. I have no need  to prove anything to \nanyone else. They can do that for themselves. I  always say honesty is the \nbest policy and if you are honest with  yourself and others the only ones who \nobject are those who&#39;s lies  arent tolerated. So just look for the truth \nyourself and dont let me  or anyone else tell you what that is. \n\nIt&#39;s a great journey  and your path is your own!\n\nMisty\n\n--- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroups  .com_ \n(http://us.mc329.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) , &quot;mrscaptainjack2&quot; &lt;jjkamp@...&gt;  wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you, guys, but I just wanted to make  sure -- really sure. \nSometimes it&#39;s hard on here to figure out which  post is replying to which!\n&gt; \n&gt; So I&#39;ve been thinking  about this over and over -- I&#39;ve been able to \nthink of little else  in the last few days -- trying to figure this out and make \nsome sort  of reasonable theory I can live with.
