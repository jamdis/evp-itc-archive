&gt; Awesome clip Frank, that is clear as a bell.  I love the fact that 
they seem to know so much as to what is going on in our personal 
live, such as your pizza clip or Bruce&#x27;s phone ringing clip.  As you 
take a step back and look at the bigger picture as to what the true 
means are regarding the clips, we can assume that they acknowledge us 
more than what we actually know.  By them comfirming facts here on 
this plane and what we are experiencing at that moment is hugh for 
our research.
&gt;    
&gt;   Just my thoughts!

&gt;            They report on her. Barbara Simpson is a talk show host 
from San Francisco, she used to fill in for Art Bell eons ago. I used 
to get stuff on EVPmaker like &#x27;Barbara Simpson--astral&#x27;. 
&gt;  
&gt;  There&#x27;s alot more to ITC than getting a dead person&#x27;s name, or 
some techno guide, it can be amazing if ya don&#x27;t prejudge what&#x27;s 
supposed to come thorugh, or block it by expectations.
