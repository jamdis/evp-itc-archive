Thanks Margaret and Bruce
   
  I downloaded the software. I cant seem to find my mic at the moment so I think I am going to just do a few test sessions without recording to make sure my radio is hacked correctly and sweeping the bands. I have it hooked up to the speakers so I can hear if anyone comes through.

  Hi Kay. All you have to do is plug in an external speaker, setup your computer to record 
(plug in mic, open up software and start recording - I use Audacity) turn on the radio and 
get the scan going, then start talking like you would if you were on the phone to a friend 
(but give a little extra time for them to answer). 

You can open the conversation with something like, "Can you hear me?" or "Can anybody 
use this radio to speak to me?" or you can try asking for someone specific. 

After you are done, close the conversation (again, like you might do if you were on the 
phone wrapping up the conversation with a friend), stop the recording, stop the radio, and 
go back and listen for responses. If you think you hear something 'real-time' during your 
session, repeat what you think you heard, so that interaction is recorded. 

Have fun! Margaret

how to set it up.

has a long anntena, and the 12-469 you can hold it in your hand, and you act as the 
anntena. That way you get better reception. Only problem with the 12-469 is that it 
clicks a little, but I can't hear it anymore. I train not to hear it.
