<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Of course i wanted comments.  Based on your previous posts on this 
group, you don&#x27;t believe that real time spirit communication is 
possible.  I just wanted to post a couple files proving otherwise, 
but i will take what you say into consideration.  I appreciate the 
honest responses.

&gt; I&#x27;m not ignoring or arguing anything. I&#x27;m only saying what I heard.
&gt; Did you not want comments?

&gt; 
&gt; Really????  What about the other 2 files i posted?  You can&#x27;t deny 
&gt; 
&gt; that there is some sort of communication going on, even the hardest 
&gt; 
&gt; skeptics as yourself have to admit the validity of those files.  I 
&gt; 
&gt; believe in a random chance of a stray radio signal coinsiding with 
&gt; 
&gt; the question asked at that time, but after 2 years and 4000 files 
&gt; 
&gt; later i have to believe that this communication is real.  I also 
use 
&gt; 
&gt; other methods that do not involve a radio at all, what could make 
&gt; 
&gt; that happen?  These are all good questions to make someone re-think 
&gt; 
&gt; their stance on RTSC and other ITC devices.  How can a scrambled up 
&gt; 
&gt; file on a computer program called evpmaker say full sentences up to 
&gt; 
&gt; 25 words in length?  Did i mention that the original file that was 
&gt; 
&gt; used had no words in it at all, only bits and pieces of audio 
&gt; 
&gt; segments.  Something to think about anyway.  I used to stand on 
your 
&gt; 
&gt; side of the fence, but after a while it can no longer be ignored 
that 
&gt; 
&gt; what we are hearing is really happening.

&gt; &gt; I didn&#x27;t hear anything intelligible.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If I try to work out the sounds as phonemes, it sounds like:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ah He La Naw Tay
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Try reading that: Ah He La Naw Tay
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Then listen to the sound again.
