<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>There seems to be a problem wiht other techs getting my circuits to work as 
well, although they are getting closer. I think it takes a tech/engineer 
first with an interest in the paranormal to be be even interested in 
building the circuits, then it seems to take a certain amount of intuition 
to get thsi stuff to work. Then, there&#x27;s a ever present problem of the 
researcher actually being able to hear any contacts.

&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Radio Interview Yesterday on Ghostly Talk...
&gt;Date: Mon, 04 Jun 2007 19:48:35 -0000
&gt;
&gt;Sorry, all...really late notice by me here. I was interviewed by
&gt;Scott and Doug for about an hour yesterday on Ghostly Talk (
&gt;http://www.ghostlytalk.com ). The topic? New research I&#x27;ve done on
&gt;the infamous &quot;Spiricom Mark IV&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;If you&#x27;re familiar with the story - basically I believe I&#x27;ve helped
&gt;dispel the goofy thought that Dr. George JEFFRIES Mueller did NOT
&gt;work for NASA (people have confused him with Dr. George EDWIN
&gt;Mueller who DID work for NASA and is considered the &quot;father of
&gt;Skylab&quot;, etc.). Plus I was able to disseminate 2 previously unknown
&gt;audio recordings (by Dr. David Rivers and the late author Harold
&gt;Sherman) which showed inconsistencies in the Spiricom recordings and
&gt;how O&#x27;Neil &quot;could&quot; have used an artificial larynx to fake the
&gt;conversations. On the other hand - I tracked down a lot of
&gt;documentation which definitely shows that Dr. George J. Mueller was
&gt;a real person and nearly everything written about him (in the
&gt;Spiricom manual, &quot;The Ghost of 29 Megacycles&quot;) is verifiable so...
&gt;
&gt;The big questions are:
&gt;
&gt;1. If this was a hoax - how DID Bill O&#x27;Neil get so much detailed
&gt;information on Mueller (he actually claimed that Mueller told him
&gt;all this via clairaudience)? Was he really an extremely good psychic?
&gt;
&gt;2. If the Spiricom Mark IV really DID work, why were other users
&gt;(such as Sarah Estep from the AAEVP) unable to get it operate?
&gt;
&gt;I still have more things to look into so maybe some more answers
&gt;will be forthcoming (or muddy the waters even more). And I want to
&gt;thank member Jaime (i.e. xtal32768@...) for finding the
&gt;Cornell Alumni News with photo of Mueller at Picatinny Arsenal.
&gt;
