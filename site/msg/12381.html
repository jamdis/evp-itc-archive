<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Short .469 session yesterday, I asked if they could tell me my name.
Response I got was &quot;your actual name?&quot;

I replied yes, my actual name and received &quot;Andy....Mike&quot;

My name is Andrew Michael, and the response was almost immediate. The
file I posted was compressed for space saving, but from my initial
question I shaved several seconds off between the &#x27;yes my actual name&#x27;
and the &#x27;andy...mike&#x27;. total clip time before compression was about 10
seconds. Still pretty new at this, so hearing my first and middle name
repeated back to me takes some getting used to, but very exciting. 

Thanks,
Andy</pre>
