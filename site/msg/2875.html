&gt; Frank, on your recent (long) video where you ask for your first name
to be spoken I can hear a response. I enhanced this part a bit for
clarity. I can hear

&gt; 
&gt;  What kind of camcorder do you have?  Is there anyway to hook a mic
up to it, or is that what you mean about not being able to put an
audio input?  I&#x27;ll try hooking my speakers up instead of using my
headset and see if I can hear it louder.
&gt; keep posting them!  That is fascinating, I have never seen the boxes
before!

&gt;  That&#x27;s as loud as I can get it without feedback. If I had a regular
camcorder with an audio input it would come though better. I stil
haven&#x27;t gone to yiou tube to see the videos myself! Thanks for watching!!

&gt; I thought I heard it say Frank too.  Frank is there anyway you can
turn up the volume of the box?  Maybe it&#x27;s my headphones but it
doesn&#x27;t seem very loud on the videos?  I love it, thanks so much for
sharing :)

&gt; Hi all;
&gt;  
&gt;  Okay, finally got a video converter to work, so up loaded longer
videos to you tube. There should be three from today. I&#x27;m not usre if
the largest one went through, it&#x27;s only 6 minutes though. then another
is aobut a minute, and the next about 20 seconds. I had to do
multiples cuz the random mode wouldn&#x27;t work for the first run. the
purpose of the videos are to show the world waht the box is supposed
to soudn like. I ask them to say my name, and they may have said
Frank, but I could hear them say Princess a couple times.
