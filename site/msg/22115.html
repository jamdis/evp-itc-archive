<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>All I know about it is what I heard on C2C, and it sounded more like a focus on the dark, and fear aspects. 

 My apologies, at times I make the mistake of reading messages on the group.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This book is such a great read, people should check it out.  Did you know that radio sweep is nothing new?  Many researchers have been using it for years.  Franz Seidel used it in the 1950&#x27;s.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess that&#x27;s where frank got the idea, just duplicate what has worked since the 50&#x27;s.  I thought frank came up with the idea of radio sweep, this book is full of stuff i never knew.  People should pick it up and read it, i got through 165 pages in just a few days.
