&gt; *Don&#x27;t know how you guy&#x27;s feel, but I still marvel at all of this, I went
&gt; to turn off the box tonight, and I just said, &quot;God Bless&quot; to them, and I got
&gt; back a man&#x27;s voice clearly repeating back to me, &quot;God Bless&quot;  in a soft
&gt; smooth tone, yet so clear it was as if he were in the same room as I.   It
&gt; still shakes me, these people are dead folks, they are dead,
&gt; dead people, that seem very much still alive some where, and isn&#x27;t it
&gt; wonderful to know that we do live on too?  I still cannot get over how
&gt; amazing, this communication. it is like having a great dream become
&gt; alive!  sf*
