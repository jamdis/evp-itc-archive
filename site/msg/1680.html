<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Wow, excellent!  I was kind of leading into that - possibly it could be 
used in conjunction with Frank&#x27;s box or just by itself on an 
investigation.

I&#x27;ve been fascinated with &quot;radionics&quot;, &quot;psychotronics&quot;, &quot;psi machines&quot;, 
or whatever you want to call them, for decades. There&#x27;s some interesting 
stuff in the book &quot;The Excalibur Briefing&quot; by Thomas E. Bearden.

(Sorry about the late response, I&#x27;ve been terribly busy and I&#x27;m getting 
caught up on some e-mail).

&gt; Hi Zack, I have a new radionics kit based on the original Hieronymus
&gt; machine. It made from Bakelite, even the stick plate is. I still need
&gt; to wire it up so I just placed the components on the still unassembled
&gt; board and uploaded a pic in my photo album on this forum. The stick
&gt; plate is also made of Bakelite but I placed a small plastic square
&gt; where the stick pad goes. My crazy plane was to adapt it to the tuning
&gt; mechanism of Frank&#x27;s Box to allow an intuitive tactile feedback
&gt; interface so I could try to find the frequencies where spirits contact
&gt; us.
&gt;
&gt; Sort of like the manual linear sweep but with a stick pad added. These
&gt; 3 dial machines are still available from Bill Jensen out of Knoxville
&gt; TN who makes them to original spec except with modern internal
&gt; circuitry. -Bill Murphy

&gt;&gt;&gt; This time I made a small plastic echo box. I tried plastic years
&gt; ago, and it
&gt;&gt;&gt; didn&#x27;t work, this time it seems to. The injection speaker accounts
&gt; for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; weaker voices I think, since it&#x27;s an ear bud, and is 32 ohm,
&gt; normal speakers
&gt;&gt;&gt; are 8 ohms. More voices are in my folder.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There are so many different types of plastics with so many different
&gt;&gt; characteristics ... ABS plastic, PVC, Delrin, acrylic, PTFE (teflon),
&gt;&gt; Cyrolon ZX ...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It might be interesting to experiment with different types and see what
&gt;&gt; works the best.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anyone here ever build a Hieronymus machine?  I understand teflon (or
&gt;&gt; fiberglass-teflon PC board material) works incredibly well for the
&gt;&gt; &quot;stick&quot; sensor plate.
