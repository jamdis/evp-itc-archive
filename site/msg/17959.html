Considering the attacks people continue to make against me on here just for=
 having a different opinion of people's results, I think you will understan=
d why I will not post my name and address here.

Try anyway though.=C2=A0 I=
 don't know how your personal beliefs here work, but others seem to get mes=
sages about people they've never heard of, or places they've never seen.

I=
 would also suggest anyone who tries this experiment, to post your results =
on the list here rather than sending them personally to me - so I won't be =
accused of losing any.

All you have to do is ask

Please 
  do not try to open the file before noon Wednesd=

  it to your computer beforehand, so you can=

  or after, the test.

Answers anyone r=

Best of Luck. I hope for this to
