Oh, you went beyond that assumption.

You said I thought there had to be fo=
ul play involved.=C2=A0 You said I assumed right away it doesn't work.

But=
 what I said was: 

"As I have said in the past, my experience with 
those =
boxes has shown me nothing paranormal yet.=C2=A0 However, people 
continue =
to say there is more to it than my experience.=C2=A0 And so, I am 
keeping =
an open mind and trying to examine the evidence you provide."

You misquote=
d me to all the people reading this list. Why did you do that?
