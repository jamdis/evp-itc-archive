<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m new here, but have been into paranormal research for 6 years now.
I am the type of person that never gets EVP voices with a recorder so
I thought I would experiment with things like the Frank&#x27;s box and
Ovilus. I recently got the ovilus and brought it to a cemetery and
field where a church burned down many years ago. I can not get too
specific without having people thinking I am making stuff up but it
got fairly wild towards the end of the session. For most of the time
we were there the Ovilus seemed to be spitting out a lot of random
stuff but it kept mentioning the name Seth. After we moved over to the
field where the church was, the ovilus got a lot more active and
started saying relevant words like cross and priest. The Ovilus was
MUCH more active when being used by our female member. Towards the end
the Ovilus said I am Seth, and the woman that was with me told Seth
that she did not want to talk to you I&#x27;ve heard bad things about you.
After that the Ovilus said rather nasty things to her and she started
feeling nauseous and she ripped the headphones off her head. Needless
to say we ended the session and got out of there.

Over the course of our investigation we found that the Ovilus was
saying many words that are not on the 500 word list, so yesterday I
did some test recordings to see what words would come up and one of
the first things that came up was: seth  blamed  rest   I am   not 
gare   demon (all in that order). Needless to say this has me
concerned that whatever seth is is still with the box so I am not even
storing this thing inside of my house. I have an MP3 of the ovilus
saying this. 

Also from my experience about 50% of the words it is saying aren&#x27;t on
the list. Chris Fleming has been getting words not on the list, and
Barry FitzGerald has stated that just over 50% of the words he is
getting are not on the list. Is there really a much larger list than
advertised or is this thing really magic? Highly doubtful IMO.

My most important question is is anyone else getting the name Seth out
of the Ovilus? How many people use this device here?</pre>
