Very nice... good job!  You \n&gt; covered all the bases and shared some very good information.

I&#39;ll be\n&gt; &gt; on Darknessradio.com at 9 p.m. Pacific time. This message has been\n&gt; &gt; posted after speaking to Frank since for me, ITC includes the research\n&gt; &gt; that is covered by this group as well as the video ITC experiments\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve done. -Bill\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
