<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello Suzanne.  Yes I am new to this forum.  I&#x27;m not sure of the
purpose of your post though: was there part of my recommendation that
you think was wrong or could be improved?

And I do hope, like you, that this is a forum where ideas and
knowledge are shared regarding EVP/ITC, rather than those forums that
rely on personal attacks or only on arguments-from-authority, instead
of on objective testing and process.  The ideas I am sharing, in fact,
relate to EVP/ITC process, and in improving the objectivity of that
research.   And again, I am more than happy to hear of what parts of
the ideas I have shared you think need improvement, or conversely, you
have found valuable.

&gt; I love this forum and do not like to get involved in the online mish
mash . . . I have to say, though . . . Rick . . . are you new to this
forum? Mike is respected in this field and though I cannot speak for
him I am 100 % certain that he knows what he is getting into . . . I,
as well as several members of my team follow and respect his work and
his ideals. 
&gt; 
&gt; I thought this was suppose to be a forum that shared ideas and
knowledge with regard to EVP/ITC rather than what I see happening here
on a daily basis.
&gt; 
&gt; Rock on Mike!!

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the clarification Mike. I would still warn that, even in 
&gt; your experiment here, you yourself could become your own weak link in
&gt; objectivity. As Cheri pointed out, even someone with the best 
&gt; intentions, who truly wants to provide accurate &amp; honest information,
&gt; is only human and subject to error. This is especially true if they
&gt; have already decided which parts of their theories are right or wrong,
&gt; without, again, objective testing. This is not a phenomenon that only
&gt; effects the home experimenter, but experts in all fields, and they
&gt; have learned of methods over time (such as the double blind testing I
&gt; mentioned) to help weed out weak processes and develop and explore
&gt; their theories on the firmest foundations possible.
&gt; 
&gt; But I understand you are not trying to prove or test anything in this
&gt; case, or use them to claim any kind of proof: you&#x27;re just trying an
&gt; experiment. So, good luck with it.

&gt; &gt; I understand where Rick is coming from, BUT his suggestion is a good 
&gt; &gt; example of how to conduct the test IF I were testing those I asked to 
&gt; &gt; help, which I&#x27;m not. This is not a test, just a means of gathering 
&gt; &gt; audio with the use of material associated with a plane crash, at a 
&gt; &gt; location other than where the crash happened.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; All I asked them to do is provide five, 30 second audio files which 
&gt; &gt; they record while using the pieces of debris I will be sending them.
&gt; &gt; I have faith in the researchers on this forum who have volunteered 
&gt; &gt; (six people so far have been selected). 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Whatever is found on the audio files will be studied, and since I 
&gt; &gt; will be the one listening to the recordings, and since I already know 
&gt; &gt; all the details of the incident, I have not set my mind to 
&gt; &gt; predetermine anything.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yes, a different type of test could have been done, and I could have 
&gt; &gt; hidden all information, but that would not have mattered for this 
&gt; &gt; effort, since the outcome is to only get the audio files, what ever 
&gt; &gt; may be found on them.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks to those who have volunteered, I cound still use four more 
&gt; &gt; people too.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have to agree with Rick, the less information in a situation like 
&gt; &gt; &gt; this- the better. When we do investigations, I supply very little 
&gt; &gt; &gt; information to my team, as a matter of fact, I prefer to be kept in 
&gt; &gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; dark (no pun intended) as much as possible myself. This type of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; phenomenon is common in many fields, it is simply the power of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggestion, there are hundreds of document cases where a well 
&gt; &gt; meaning 
&gt; &gt; &gt; witness who truly wants to provide accurate &amp; honest information, 
&gt; &gt; can be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; led by innocent suggestions.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; A really really good example of this is Derren Brown. Watch this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; video... http://www.youtube. com/watch? v=ZyQjr1YL0zg Of 
&gt; &gt; course, I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#x27;t think Rick nor anyone was suggesting you would intentionally 
&gt; &gt; lead 
&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone, but it is sooo easy to do so.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Prejudice refers to prejudgment. So, in this case, prejudice 
&gt; &gt; meant to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already be ready to hear what someone already described, 
&gt; &gt; rather than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; listening before you have that information, and so can 
&gt; &gt; maximize your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; objectivity.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe you could clarify what you meant by my viewpoint? I

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To insure this testing is objective, wouldn&#x27;t it have been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to inform everyone what kind of disaster these items were
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from? Now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that everyone knows they are from a plane crash, that 
&gt; &gt; will set
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prejudice of hearing plane/travel related words in the 
&gt; &gt; evp noises.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And as you probably know, once that prejudice is active, 
&gt; &gt; once
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Doesn&#x27;t that sound like someone saying
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sssssstewardesssss ...&quot;, then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone hears THAT word, rather than just noise, or, for 
&gt; &gt; example
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Stewed ass&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And, if something does sound like a plane/travel related 
&gt; &gt; word, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will now be highlighted as an example of why this was a 
&gt; &gt; successful
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test, and the other less-relevant words ignored. This is 
&gt; &gt; a form of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confirmation bias, which again, hurts the value of the 
&gt; &gt; test.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A more objective way would have been to send out both 
&gt; &gt; crash
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; related
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; items, and completely innocuous items, with no 
&gt; &gt; explanation of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each was from, and see what kind of EVPs were returned on 
&gt; &gt; each.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Further, the returned EVPs should then be returned to 
&gt; &gt; someone to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evaluate who ALSO doesn&#x27;t know the origin of the objects, 
&gt; &gt; so that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they do not torture the interpretations into the forms you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hope and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expect them to be (again, plane/travel related). While 
&gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course lacks all kinds of controls, this would at least 
&gt; &gt; be a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; start to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defining a double-blind test, which is the gold standard 
&gt; &gt; for good
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; research in this kind of research.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even though you have tried to keep some of the 
&gt; &gt; information quiet,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is still quite a large opportunity for guessing and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coincidence. For example, one person might assume this 
&gt; &gt; was from an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; airshow (since, as you said, the event was very fast, and 
&gt; &gt; many
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saw it), and so only send in EVPs that would be relevant 
&gt; &gt; to that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation (I.e. Not sending in child-like sounds, or 
&gt; &gt; sending in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sounds that sound like scratchy tower or inter-plane
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication) . If the crash was a commercial airline, 
&gt; &gt; then dozens
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of different people could have been killed, which means 
&gt; &gt; you could
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find SOME relevancy no matter what noises are returned to 
&gt; &gt; you:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practical any word, name, or sound will support some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speculation that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it could have been relevant to one of those people.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do think it is a good idea to test your theories. But 
&gt; &gt; my purpose
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here is to suggest ways to help these tests be as 
&gt; &gt; objective as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible, and for your efforts and testing to be as worth 
&gt; &gt; while as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible, and for the youtube video results you make to 
&gt; &gt; be as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; valuable and bulletproof as possible. But I am concerned 
&gt; &gt; that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; above scenario is full of opportunity for subjectivity and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misinterpretation.
