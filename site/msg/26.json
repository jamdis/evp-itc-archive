Then its seems that it ope=\r\nned a door for them, they are conversing amongst themselves saying hello to=\r\n each other, that they can see, they can see the computer, one of them said=\r\n he was beseiged. I didnt record again till yesterday, and i kinda wonder i=\r\nf they are mad? i kept getting vibes to record but have been to tired with =\r\nmoving. Can they get mad with you? i assume they can. When i recorded, i ha=\r\nve been using microsoft word and typing my questions, and a little bit of t=\r\nalking too, if they can see the computer &lt;so they said&gt; why not?! I also us=\r\ned this thing from EVP maker that shows pictures and makes clicks and tones=\r\n. The only thing they had to say was &quot;watch&quot; watch&quot;, wether they ment to no=\r\nt say anything and just watch m e or refering to some of the questions i ha=\r\nd, i dont know, cant assume anything lol. What can i do to get them to talk=\r\n to me more? Answer questions? like no one has indentified themselves and i=\r\n would really like to know who they are. I have a few people i would like t=\r\no talk to that have passed over. However anyone is nice lol. I just would l=\r\nike to open this door MORE now, that i have closed off. I think that I open=\r\ned a doorway for them but i want to interact more! People have been referin=\r\ng to me as a &quot;sensitive&quot;? I assume meaning that i am able to tell if they a=\r\nre here etc. Which i usually can. Is it possible that because in the past f=\r\nor the most part i have kept this part of me closed off, except those entit=\r\nies that refuse to be silenced come through, that they are skeptical of tal=\r\nking to me? That i cant handle it?\n\n      Anyway, justthought id talk with =\r\nsomemore people who have &quot;been there done that&quot;\n      I would like to have =\r\nsomeone over who has alot of history and do an evp in my home and talk to t=\r\nhem for me. &lt;sigs&gt;\n\n      Amy\n\n\n\n\n      http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-I=\r\nTC/\n\n      LON3_S7AR  YAHOO MESENGER ID\n      _____________________________=\r\n_____________________\n      Do You Yahoo!?\n      Tired of spam?
