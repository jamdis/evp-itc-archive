My friend has been working on \nthese \n&gt; for me and i&#39;m trying them out and starting to get results.  It \n&gt; really takes an aquired ear to catch it real time though, better \n&gt; success playing it back later.  I can slow the randomness down, but \n&gt; than people will just say it was a radio station.  I&#39;m sure \neveryone \n&gt; knows how that goes.  I feel if it&#39;s really fast like i&#39;ve done it, \n&gt; it&#39;s really not on a station long enough to get a sentence \n&gt; out...Right???\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;urkel232002&quot; &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Radio is automatic sweep.
