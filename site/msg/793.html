          Hi everyone! I'm new here, though I know of some of you from other 
boards, IAH, Haunted Times, etc.

I am Amy from Staten Island Paranormal Society. I just got to meet 
Chris Moon this weekend and got to experience "Frank's box"! It was 
amazing! The box actually asked for me by name and told us about 
papers that are supposedly hidden in the house. Frank, I just have 
to say, "WOW"!! 

Yesterday we went to try to find them, but the one floorboard we 
managed to get up didn't have any papers in it. Because it is a 
historical location, we can't rip up the entire floor, though we'd 
love to! LOL!!

Has anyone successfully been able to contact the people who came 
through on the box in another method, say through their digital 
recorders? I'd like to try to get more specific instructions 
from "Jonathan" on where the papers may be. The director seems to 
feel strongly that these papers are really there.
