<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I actually heard most of what came out of the box that night.  On 
one occasion one of the boards that had a Bio on it of the history 
of that cell block actually jumped out and Chris and I and that&#x27;s 
where the shadow went up the wall.  I didn&#x27;t see it, but i was 
working a lot of equipment that night.  They were pissed at that 
time and we heard them talking at the end of the hall and not from 
the box, so they were really there.

&gt; Here is the link to it, Frank. Give a listen when you have a 
couple  
&gt; hours.
&gt; 
&gt; I also listened to Steve H.&#x27;s 2 hour recording from Eastern State  
&gt; Penn last night. I found some of it amazing and some of it wildly  
&gt; annoying, especially the researcher close by the microphone who 
was  
&gt; chewing gum. That aside, there was more very odd and wonderful  
&gt; communication, and also a lot of Chris seeing shadows, 
apparitions,  
&gt; black masses crawling down hallways, and other things that no one  
&gt; else seemed to see. I wanted to ask Steve H. if he had witnessed 
any  
&gt; of this, since he was with Chris the whole time. For the 
listener,  
&gt; the effect was that of a veritable mob of live humans who (the 
posse  
&gt; that night) who were kept in a constant state of anxiety. They 
didn&#x27;t  
&gt; need the extra hype, HMO, &#x27;cause the pissed off dead inmates were  
&gt; being surly enough on their own.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;d say I agreed with Chris&#x27;s interpretations--and granted, I was 
not  
&gt; there and did have problems hearing because of gum smacking and 
other  
&gt; people rustling and talking--about 30 percent of the time. That 
said,  
&gt; I heard a lot of things loud and clear.

&gt; &gt;  Interesting. This is the &quot;eveidence&quot; I usaully don&#x27;t get to 
see  
&gt; &gt; and hear. All I usually hear is someone saying how every other  
&gt; &gt; researcher in the world gets nothing, he is the only one that 
gets  
&gt; &gt; the valid communucation, which personally I find highly 
insulting.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  One fact is, I did not make a &quot;telephone to dead&quot;, I don&#x27;t 
know  
&gt; &gt; what the f--- that is, and I don&#x27;t endorse it! Nor do I 
appreciate  
&gt; &gt; my name being connected to the so called &quot;Telephone to dead&quot; on  
&gt; &gt; every friggin&#x27; ad for Moon&#x27;s public appearances. I just make 
the  
&gt; &gt; boxes, I&#x27;m not someone&#x27;s lacky.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank--I have listened to this APSR broadcast and was 
incredibly
&gt; &gt; impressed with what occurred at this event. Chris&#x27;s box is quite
&gt; &gt; capable of behaving like John Edward--directly bringing relations
&gt; &gt; through to talk to those who need to hear them. Some of the 
responses
&gt; &gt; were astoundingly clear and loud. It certainly sounded similar 
to what
&gt; &gt; I have heard of what Bruce is getting, and honestly, it is 
exactly
&gt; &gt; what I hope to get with my box when I receive it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you haven&#x27;t listened to this, you really should. I think 
Chris
&gt; &gt; made his usual statements about Edison and the 30, but aside from
&gt; &gt; that, this was a wonderful session and people were extremely 
moved.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you want, I&#x27;ll find the URL.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Christopher was immediately taken by what he had seen and 
heard.
&gt; &gt; He was able to &gt; make a direct connection with spirits. 
inhabitants,
&gt; &gt; victims, participants, and &gt; witnesses...describing amazing 
events and
&gt; &gt; even some unspeakable acts that had &gt; happened within the walls 
of
&gt; &gt; these notoriously haunted places. The details &gt; afforded by these
&gt; &gt; spirits gave answers to lingering questions that could not &gt; 
have come
&gt; &gt; from anyone but the parties involved. Already amazed by the &gt;
&gt; &gt; instrument&#x27;s ability to connect with these historical figures,
&gt; &gt; Christopher soon &gt; realized that other entities were trying to 
reach
&gt; &gt; out as well. Deceased fathers, &gt; sons, mothers, daughters, and 
friends
&gt; &gt; of session participants were sending &gt; messages through the 
device.
&gt; &gt; Talk of this spread, and last year, at the Ghost &gt; Chaser&#x27;s 
Weekend
&gt; &gt; Conference in Savannah, Georgia, Christopher was asked to do a &gt;
&gt; &gt; presentation about his research with the Telephone to the Dead. 
This
&gt; &gt; quickly &gt; turned into an impromtu public demonstration, with
&gt; &gt; participants, one by one, &gt; coming forward requesting to speak 
with
&gt; &gt; loved ones who had died. Surprisingly, &gt; even to Christopher, 
these
&gt; &gt; requests were met with comforting and sometimes vital &gt; 
messages. The
&gt; &gt; presentation was recorded and broadcasted by A.P.S.R. Radio.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From a recent add for another presentation, but apparently 
the
&gt; &gt; rest of us get nothing like this, so it doesn&#x27;t even work for us.
&gt; &gt; Guess I&#x27;ll just go back to killing time wth Ham radio, and quit
&gt; &gt; wasting all my time and money on useless boxes.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Curious that no one else gets any &quot;real&quot; contacts--event the 
so
&gt; &gt; called box inventor gets nothing.
