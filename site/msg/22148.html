I have been reading the arguments for a few weeks now and can I say what =
I think? Just as Newton and Einstein and others like them are giants, they =
have people such as Stephen Hawking that stand on their shoulders. The Hawk=
ings that stand on the shoulders of giants are no less genius in their own =
right and should also be given credit also. But we can't forget that the gi=
ants themselves made mistakes and had failures along the way. They are no l=
ess than genius for their trial and errors as well as their successes. For =
had we not had the giants, failures and all, we would not advance any furth=
er in technology and wisdom. :)

Another thought is many times ideas come a=
round the same time in different locations. This is a phenomenon that has f=
ascinated me and I often wonder how 2 or more people can get the same thoug=
ht in roughly the same time period. Take for instance the discovery of smal=
l particles in atoms (or molecules, I am rusty at my science sorry). There =
were scientists discovering these in different locations around the world a=
t the same time! I'm sure it can be argued that one scientist discovered th=
e break through before another but it doesn't dispute the fact that both we=
re working on the same thing in the same time period.=C2=A0

So for argumen=
t sake let's give credit to those who have successfully engineered the spir=
it boxes and those who have stood on the shoulders of the original inventor=
s and keep in mind there may be a few of the original inventors at the same=
 time! You discovered it. GREAT! How wonderful that you contributed to some=
thing so genius! I hope that you continue to experiment and enrich us with =
your findings and failings as those are important too. (Remember that Ediso=
n failed many times with the light bulb before he got it right.) I would en=
courage all of you to go forward and advance your technologies and remember=
 there is always someone trying to steal fame and fortune. You can protect =
your ideas with patents before releasing them to the public if you are real=
ly concerned with ownership of originality.=C2=A0

I hope I haven't overste=
pped my bounds but I want to reassure those who are frustrated that there a=
re those who recognize genius and those who stand on shoulders from those w=
ho steal. Just because we are silent doesn't mean we are blind, deaf, and m=
ute. I hope this helps.=C2=A0
