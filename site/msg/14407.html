&gt; Would it be possible for you to post those recordings? Might be interesting
&gt; to see what some can actually find!

&gt;   I have a recording provided to me by some people whose house is
&gt; supposedly haunted. The recording is of a couple messages left on their
&gt; landline phone answering machine. The messages are mostly garbled and
&gt; unintelligible. I&#x27;ve tried every method of processing them to try to bring
&gt; out the words in the messages, mostly with no luck (that&#x27;s how distorted
&gt; they are.) I was able to hear &quot;This is your father ...&quot; in one message and
&gt; &quot;I love you very much very much&quot; in another.
&gt;
&gt; The people suspect the house is haunted by their father and mother, who
&gt; both passed away within 6 months of these messages. It could very well be.

&gt;&gt; I agree. You need to try every way possible to find the best one.

&gt;&gt;&gt;   *Wish I knew how to &quot;enhance&quot; the correct way, because they sure have
&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot to say over there, and I all ready had my mom come through loud and
&gt;&gt;&gt; clear last night again, even a little boy and dad maybe from this
&gt;&gt;&gt; neighborhood talked directly to me, although for me it sounded like they
&gt;&gt;&gt; were in a tin can.   There is plenty of other stuff coming through as well,
&gt;&gt;&gt; what do I care if people don&#x27;t believe this, I do because, I know this is
&gt;&gt;&gt; meant to be, and I am sure of it it&#x27;s going to be something for other&#x27;s like
&gt;&gt;&gt; seeing is believing and there is nothing we can do for them, it&#x27;s like the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Wright Brother&#x27;s flying for the first time here people, they said how in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; world will that big heavy thing get off the ground?  I say lets go for it, a
&gt;&gt;&gt; machine will be found to make them come in loud and clear one day.  sf*

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now I may be biased to the &quot;investigation&quot; way of doing things.  I do
&gt;&gt;&gt; clean up evps if I hear something and can&#x27;t make it out do to ambient
&gt;&gt;&gt; noise.  So hear is my question.  When do you stop cleaning up?  Wouldn&#x27;t to
&gt;&gt;&gt; much enhancing &quot;taint&quot; the results?  To me the more enhancing you do the
&gt;&gt;&gt; less convincing it becomes.  I hope no one finds this offensive, it is not
&gt;&gt;&gt; meant to be I am just really curious.  The way I look at it is that if you
&gt;&gt;&gt; have to do so much enhancing to find anything, was there really something
&gt;&gt;&gt; there to begin with.  Are we just making ourselves believe there is
&gt;&gt;&gt; something there??
