ing about "it hits the earth" again last night while testing one of those s=
ingle supply dual sweep boxes, so set up a hack radio I had handy. "--Behin=
dTheSun--ComesFarFromEarth--(jack-frag)IsComin'--Session-EarthWillThenColli=
de-ItEnds--Comet-Good(?)". The jack thing is Jack FM, 105.5 FM a rock stati=
on. Presumable 2012. The December 21st date from the Mayans seems to b=
e a middle number, there's like a window right around Christmas, as they se=
em to mention the 17th along with this stuff. Who knows if it means anythin=
g, but what I don't like are those that profess to "know better". </div>
