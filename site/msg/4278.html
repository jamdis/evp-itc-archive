<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi LC,

Yes, the &quot;click&quot; can be cut down a bit by using a chamber.  It&#x27;s 
a &quot;phase&quot; thing.  When the &quot;click&quot; (or any sound wave) is reached at 
the input mic at 180 degrees out of phase with the original I 
understand there is a cancel effect.  That works with any sound wave I 
think, so you&#x27;re bound to have some &quot;clicks&quot; and their 180 out of phase 
wave reaching the mic nearly at the same time, cancelling somewhat.
There is so much bouncing going on in there I would love to see what 
the entire pattern looks lke on a scope.  There must be alot of phase 
shifting going on.

I tried my prototype with and without the chamber yesterday.  I found a 
BIG different, and I&#x27;m sticking with the chamber effect.  For one 
thing, it increased the amplification at least three-fold when I used 
the chamber, not to mention all the mixing and phasing.

I hope to play some of my box audio files tonight on my internet radio 
show. Both from my chamber system and from the three 12-469/mixer 
system.

Hey, LC... keep up the good work, and thanks for sharing!

- Mike

&gt; Thanks, Mike.  
&gt; 
&gt; I am still working on different set-ups in a sound chamber.  I 
&gt; realize the chamber is not necessary, but I think with the 12-469, it 
&gt; helps to run it into a box to mix it, which helps remove the &quot;click&quot; 
&gt; noise received while it sweeps the AM band.  Also, I want to try 
&gt; bouncing down an echo chamber, so it slows the sound down a bit to 
&gt; possibly make it easier to hear. Still experimenting here.
