<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just put in several more pictures of the construction process in my
goldBox directory:

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Marty%27s%20goldBox/

Added a SPST power switch to the 820 pcb just like explained in the
last method.

Constructed an echo box with removable input (so other future devices
can be plugged in and the box reused ), and attached amplifier with. 
Also used quartz plates for the divider walls in an attempt to
experiment in aiding in communication.  As always, I&#x27;m trying to use
slightly modded off the shelf parts for ease of duplication.

Parts needed: 

- Radio Shack 6&quot; x 3&quot; x 2&quot; project box
http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062282

- Radio Shack Deluxe Pillow Speaker (these are no longer sold on the
site, and on clearance at local Radio Shack Locations.  Of note is
this will accept a stereo signal and combine them to mono, instead of
just ignoring one of the channels as some mono speakers do.

- Radio Shack Stereo Amplified Listener (33-1096).  This is a small
amplifier with built in sensitive directional mics that are normally
used for helping hard of hearing people hear better.  You may have
seen cheaper versions on late night infomercials with spouses using
these to listen to the tv at lower levels while not waking their
husband/wife.

- 3 Quartz Plates 2&quot; x 2&quot; 1/8&quot;, from Prism Research Glass, Inc.

- Hot glue gun.


To mod the pillow speaker, pry open the case with a screw driver. 
You&#x27;ll notice that the wires connecting the speaker to the volume dial
pcb are very short.  You&#x27;ll simply need to desolder the wires and
replace them with longer length wires.

To mod the amplified listener, you&#x27;ll remove the single screw holding
the case together and pry open the case.  You&#x27;ll see a piece of
cardboard with shiny &quot;silver&quot; coating over half the pcb.  Carefully
pull this off (I say carefully because its attached by a single
soldered staple and industrial hot glue, with wires hidden underneath
the cardboard.  The glue can pull the wires with it as you lift up). 
You&#x27;ll see it comes with dual mics inside, you&#x27;ll want to be careful
to keep the mic heads clean from any particles or accidental contact
from your fingers (always handle them by the attached rubber guards).
 The mics suffer from the same problem as the pillow speaker, short
wires.  You&#x27;ll simply want to desolder them and reattach them with
longer length wires.  I then reattach the protective cardboard piece
with electrical tape, which I also use to mount it to the echo box. 
Leave the back side off, as it won&#x27;t fit anymore with the new wiring. 

Use a hot glue gun to mount the pillow speaker and quartz plates
inside the project case.  Make sure the speaker is &quot;floating&quot; (by
gluing the foam backing of the speaker) and that the cone is not
touching any of the box edges.  Also with the quartz plates, be sure
to make sure and seal off the two edges of each plate that come in
contact with the box walls.  I put a coat of glue directly on the
plate edges, and then once seated in the box I run along the edges (as
you see in the pics) to improve stability.

Use electrical tape (or whatever else you like) to mount the amplifier
to the echo box on the side.   Make sure and mount it with the battery
compartment extended well enough above the echo box so the batteries
can be easily replaced when needed.  Bend the mic wires down so the
mics are inside the echo box.  The wires are sturdy enough so that
they&#x27;ll &quot;float&quot;.  If you want more support, take the foam discs off
the amplifier pcb (the mics were set in to these, and they are glued
on and should simply peel off) and stick them on to the walls of the
echo box.  Then glue the wires to them.

The quartz plates and the speaker extend about an 1/8 of an inch above
the project box edge, so the lid will no longer fit.  You&#x27;ll want to
get some sound proof foam, mount it to the lid, and then fasten it to
the box.  Besides sound proofing and protecting the wires from the
speaker and mics, it&#x27;ll add a little more shock protection to the
plates if traveling.  You can mount a Velcro faster or any other
method you want so that its sealed tight yet still removable.
