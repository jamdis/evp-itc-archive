April, could you hear the one with the 3 men talking  about a "rat" mouse" 
2 " " where is the super?" pregnant mouse" that came  in loud and clear for 
me.  They  kept me up all night, made me  laugh.

There is a movie called "What the Bleep Do  We Know" which is along these 
lines. Very interesting.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Perception is  Probabilistic



Thought these comments might be interesting in light of  recent
threads. Dr. Sam El-Khazen recently published an article in  the
Journal of Neuroquantology (study of brain function at the  quantum
mechanical level). In this paper entitled "DNA The Gateway  to
Time", El-Khazen talks about the relationship between the  structure
of DNA, time, conscious perception and gravity. There is  credible
evidence that these are intimately correlated. 

An  important finding for this group has to do with how we may in
fact detect  external influences in the physical world. If El-Khazen
has it right, two  EM waves must align in order for the preception
process to even begin. If  this does not happen, there is nothing to
perceive, even though we may be  impacted by an external potentially
influencing EM wave. The second wave  is generated from borrowed
energy within our brain cells and is modelled  upon the structure of
DNA strands. So yes we are impacted by billions of  EM signals per
second but we actually detect only a small portion of  these that we
later process in the late-stage perceptual processes.  

This would nicely explain why two people would perceive  events
differently despite the fact that they were literally side by  side
witnessing the same event. Again this is strictly a matter  of
random probability, it seems to have nothing whatsoever to do  with
volition or intention. That is more the focus of the  later
perceptual processing which is in turn dependent upon  this
probabilistic process.

This could also explain why it is that  EVP and ITC signals are
perceived differently by different people even  when no physical
alteration to the media has occurred and why different  things are
heard more easily at different times by the same  person.
