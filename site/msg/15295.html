<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I bought a couple extra 12-587 radios today and hacked them, so i can offer them
to the group to those who are having a hard time finding them.

They were like $32 with tax plus whatever shipping cost to your location would
be. I also have other boxes for sale:

RS 12-587----$32 plus shipping-(Actual Cost of unit)

MiniBox Plus----$400 plus shipping-(I paid $550 originally)

Joe&#x27;s Box----$150.00-(I paid $250 originally)

MiniBox 2----$150

Let me know if anyone is interested in any or all of the boxes, i need to free
up some space in my home and am offer them at a discounted rate. I rarely have
time to use all of these, so they must go. I figured that i would offer the
group first before putting them on Ebay.
