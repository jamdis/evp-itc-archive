I am going thru a similar situation with  my \nfather but he refuses to take care of himself.  Most of all I got on him  about \nthe smoking which is funny because I still smoke.  But he has a sever  case of \nsleep apnea that has not been diagnosed yet and he is robbign his body  of \nmuch needed oxygen.  Anyways, the spirits had a message for me today  regarding \nmy father and they called him a puppy.  WHich he is at this point  always \nstriving for attention, boy do they have his number.  I hope all  goes better with \nyour wife.\n \nJeff\n \n \nIn a message dated 2/29/2008 2:11:03 P.M. Central Standard Time,  \npurplealiengirl@... writes:\n\n \n \n \n&quot;5d.
