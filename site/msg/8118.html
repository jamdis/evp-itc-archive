After playing it a few times, I was not able to hear the toothache

&gt; 
&gt; The first one says &quot;you have a toothache&quot; and I did!
&gt; 
&gt; The other I am asking about mike and he tells me 
&gt; &quot;foget about me you are the teacher&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe I they feel I have outgrown my tech&#x27;s and hopefully have the 
&gt; right theories and opinions I am passing on to the new researchers.
&gt; 
&gt; hope everyone had a good holiday :)
