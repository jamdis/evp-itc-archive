I&#39;m thinking EVP Asst. might be interesting to \ncombine with some of the radio sweeps.  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I experimented today with EVP assistant as a backdrop to my session \n&gt; with EVP maker.  The file i just posted was from using white noise in \n&gt; the background from that program along with a regular allophone \n&gt; session.  If anybody wants to experiment with different sounds in the \n&gt; background, you can download that program too.  \n&gt; \n&gt; More Freeware:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.evpuk.com/evp_assistant_software.html\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
