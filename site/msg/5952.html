RE: [EVP-ITC] Babs has Issues!

Frank R., Once again pal, we are on apposin=
g sides.As far as Babs having many friends here Welllll??? Anyway I want to=
 address the subject of removing time from a file.The way I am understandin=
g what you mean by removing time is tocut segments of the recording out of =
the file. I myself do cut out simple noise or static fragments that are nat=
urally occurring in the sweep of the boxfor instance the minibox has an inh=
erent hum or thump as it's Creator calls it. When I receive a response thro=
ugh the minibox it will go something like this "yes HUM Bruce HUM we HUM ar=
e HUM here HUM"I will definitely remove every HUM from between the words bu=
t that does not change the message or affect the words that are spoken.I'm =
assuming that is what you are talking about when you and babs mention "remo=
ving time"  I'm just guessing but maybe babs is trying to insinuate that re=
searchers here are altering their files., If so maybe she should be looking=
 for that in her own back yard. There must be someone she knows for a fact =
that isaltering communications. And mike please lets not turn this into a w=
hole big thing! Bruce

Very good observation Babs. Let me say that you h=

 an interest in ITC, are a researcher and a complex thinker. I think we hav=

removes time from their recordings. I have never removed time from my recor=
dings and see no reason why anyone else would without saying so in an accom=
panied post.I have limited experience with the 12-469's as a single piece o=
f equipment. I have arranged mine per Mike's, "Spiricomp" design. I have 3,=
 12-469's feeding a four channel mixer, which goes into a laptop running DC=
6 with Soundsoap 2. Mine scan equally spaced on the FM band. I have had pre=

 I had a feeling I was getting a different group than I normally have for t=

 would tell me they will look for them. Well about 2 weeks ago the 12-469 a=
rrangement started generating a lot of interference and feedback. I started=
 hearing radio static voices as I use to get with shortwave. Not voice frag=

 first messages to come across was from a familiar voice telling me and I q=

e clear messages I have been getting using water and fan noise. That does n=
ot mean I have given up on the 12-469's but I won't use them again until I =

Alright, you all know I'm v=
ocal and I haven't made any "friends" herebut, if we can put that aside for=
 a moment...Spirit communication has been my passion since day one, a littl=
e over6 years ago. I am a believer in the afterlife and a believer inspirit=
s attempting to communicate with us for a variety of reasons. Ihave spiritu=
al beliefs that I feel strongly about and devote much ofmy waking (and slee=
ping) moments to thoughts about this field.However, I am also a researcher =
and a skeptic. In order for me toallow ideas to become part of my reality I=
 must experiment. In orderfor me to believe something is paranormal I HAVE =
to rule out all otherpossible causes. That being said, I have some question=
s. My hope isthat there are some here willing to enter into discussion with=
 me.I have a difficult time with many of the files here. Many times, therei=
s no question included in the file. I can not determine whether ornot the "=
reply" is an intelligent reply. Maybe this has to do withallowable file siz=
e.Some of the files I have been able to download. (I don't always keepmy em=
ail settings on for this group as I get too many - lol) When Ilook at the f=
ile I see problems. There will be complete flat linesilence between the wor=
ds. Many times the "reply" is also at the samedecibel as the question asker=
s voice. Those two things should notoccur naturally considering the devices=
 being used. That tells me thatthere is manipulation of the files. Now, wha=
t is manipulation to me,may not be manipulation to others. To me, any alter=
ing of the recordedfile constitutes manipulation. I do not know if the repl=
y wasintelligent or manipulated to be intelligent. Some say that they simpl=
y remove the "no response" time. I've beentold it can be as much as 18 seco=
nds removed from between words. Nowwe run into the problem of us deciding w=
hat word fits in with thequestion. What words are being ignored? Did we tak=
e nonsense and makesense? Did we amp every noise/word or only what fit?I th=
ink it's great that files are offered for peer review. However, Ithink we h=
ave to load them untouched or at the very least, offerexactly what was done=
 to the entire file. Time elapsed between words,what was amped, etc. I'd al=
so love to see some of these sessions videotaped with the question asker fa=
cing the camera and a second handclock visible. Truly, we aren't researchin=
g if we don't have someprotocol in place.Here is an issue I have with the R=
S Hacks. I have the 469. It takesapproximately 18 seconds to scan through t=
he AM frequencies. Now, thetypical person would think that we can take that=
 18 seconds and divideit by the number of AM stations to determine how long=
 we are on eachstation before moving on to the next one. In that way we cou=
lddetermine what is impossible to be said via a radio fragment. However,tha=
t's not correct. The scan cycle can vary from one frequency to thenext and =
of course the biggest problem is that some stations arepicked up over multi=
ple frequencies; AM 640 can be heard on 630, 640,650, 660 and maybe even 67=
0. That extends the time a great deal. Thisis a difficult problem because i=
t is almost impossible for the averageperson to be able to make a determina=
tion on time this way. I heard about the following today; An experimenter r=
ecords at the sametime every day Mon-Fri. We hear about the importance of m=
editating,automatic writing, etc at the same time every day but what we hav=
e toremember with this, is that now we are in essence tuning into the samer=
adio show every day. One of my first experiments with the 469 had mehearing=
 this deep male voice over and over again. What was he tryingto tell me, I =
wondered. Than I realized that he was speakingapproximately every 18 second=
s; every time the scan hit that station.So, if you are removing up to 18 se=
conds between words, then you arereally only recording the words from one s=
tation. This post is IN NO WAY trying to start anything besides discussiona=
bout some research problems. I know that there are those who are notconcern=
ed with anything more than the communication itself but I thinkthat it is o=
f the utmost importance to attempt to factor in someprotocol in order for t=
his to be considered serious research at all.
