I found myself \nalmost changing the word skeptic to cynic in my former post. ;)\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi LC and Stefan.  I think the term skeptic is often misapplied to \nthose who are cynics.  \n&gt; Skepticism is healthy and usually these people are somewhat open-\nminded given enough \n&gt; persuasive evidence, whereas someone who is cynical is not open to \nchanging their view \n&gt; no matter how much evidence is presented them.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Just a thought that semantics might be getting in the way here, \nwith some people using \n&gt; the word skeptic in it traditional/literal sense of the word, and \nother are actually meaning \n&gt; &quot;cynic&quot; but using the term skeptic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Stefan, yes, I agree.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I should clarify.  Some skeptics/critics never intend to \n&gt; &gt; believe...their mind is made up.  That&#39;s who I avoid.  Now a \nskeptic or \n&gt; &gt; critic who is at least open to the possibility of communication \nfrom \n&gt; &gt; the other side, I will point them in a direction to seek answers \nwithin \n&gt; &gt; for themselves.  :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi LC,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There will always be skeptics and critics, but one thing seems\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certain: everyone has their own time when they become open to \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possibility of the paranormal/spiritual existing.  I just \nchoose to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; share with those whose time has come.  :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I wouldn&#39;t see an skeptical/critical attitude as something \nnegative.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some people just aren&#39;t &quot;believers&quot;, their intellect wants to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; satisfied, too. :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So being skeptical/critical doesn&#39;t necessarily mean not being a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;seeker&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stefan\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
