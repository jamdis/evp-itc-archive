&gt;  *Wish I knew how to &quot;enhance&quot; the correct way, because they sure have a
&gt; lot to say over there, and I all ready had my mom come through loud and
&gt; clear last night again, even a little boy and dad maybe from this
&gt; neighborhood talked directly to me, although for me it sounded like they
&gt; were in a tin can.   There is plenty of other stuff coming through as well,
&gt; what do I care if people don&#x27;t believe this, I do because, I know this is
&gt; meant to be, and I am sure of it it&#x27;s going to be something for other&#x27;s like
&gt; seeing is believing and there is nothing we can do for them, it&#x27;s like the
&gt; Wright Brother&#x27;s flying for the first time here people, they said how in the
&gt; world will that big heavy thing get off the ground?  I say lets go for it, a
&gt; machine will be found to make them come in loud and clear one day.  sf*

&gt; Now I may be biased to the &quot;investigation&quot; way of doing things.  I do clean
&gt; up evps if I hear something and can&#x27;t make it out do to ambient noise.  So
&gt; hear is my question.  When do you stop cleaning up?  Wouldn&#x27;t to much
&gt; enhancing &quot;taint&quot; the results?  To me the more enhancing you do the less
&gt; convincing it becomes.  I hope no one finds this offensive, it is not meant
&gt; to be I am just really curious.  The way I look at it is that if you have to
&gt; do so much enhancing to find anything, was there really something there to
&gt; begin with.  Are we just making ourselves believe there is something there??
