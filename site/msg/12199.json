And I also have a diagram Frank Ratka may have sent me (unless I misfiled it LOL). As for materials its better to ask Frank what he used for that.\n\nAttaching files to this post.\n\nMisty\n\n\n--- On Fri, 9/19/08, lanmonkey_1999 &lt;lanmonkey_1999@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: lanmonkey_1999 &lt;lanmonkey_1999@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Echo Chamber - Specifics\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, September 19, 2008, 1:57 PM\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt; I did a search of the group messages and found a reference\n&gt; to:\n&gt; 042508-BoxChannels.jpg\n&gt; However the link is broken as I believe the file was\n&gt; probably moved.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, two questions: \n&gt; 1) Does someone have a good link to this file? \n&gt; 2) Can someone provide specifics on an Echo Chamber. Size,\n&gt; material,\n&gt; diagrams, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you all very much,\n&gt; Jay\n&gt; IRLab.com\n\n\n      \r\n--0-2030311610-1221859199=:68056\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;042508-BoxChannels.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;042508-BoxChannels.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--0-2030311610-1221859199=:68056\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;Echo Chamber.JPG&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;Echo Chamber.JPG&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--0-2030311610-1221859199=:68056--"}
