Nicely said. I am new to this group as well as to this type research so I h=
ave been just sitting back and reading so that I might better understand th=
e whole area of EVP. Quite truthfully......the squabbling is juvenile and w=
orthless and a big turn off. Those who are arguing and power playing.... sh=
ut up (AT LEAST ON THIS SITE) or get out because your personal attitudes to=
wards each other can carry on some where else on your own time. Please eval=
uate your your true motives for being involved in a feild we are barely tou=
ching the surface of. Time can be spent much better...dont you think.

Just a note to remind everyone we arent here to argue we are here to resear=
ch together. So if you have negative remarks to make to each other or discu=
ssions which should be done in private take them off this group to private =
emails. We dont need the negativity here it interferes with the work we are=
 trying to do and wont be tolerated.

Nobody is better than anyone else or =
less worthy for contact than anyone else.
