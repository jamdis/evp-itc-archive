They\n&gt; claim they have &quot;an expert&quot; to analyze it, but I think everyone realizes\n&gt; they have no one honest to test the box, they just want it to go away. Which\n&gt; means many get verifiable information through the box and &quot;science&quot; doesn&#39;t\n&gt; like it. How can the box work when they know there are no spirits, and since\n&gt; it works, they are wrong and they just can&#39;t *be* wrong!\n&gt; \n&gt;  I subscribe to the skeptic newsletter, it&#39;s a way to see what&#39;s out there\n&gt; for alternative science. Generally, if something works, the skepdicks are\n&gt; all over it.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
