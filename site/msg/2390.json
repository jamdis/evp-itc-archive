I have always heard and read articles\nsuggesting that low compression (ELF/VLF) waves in the 5Hz to 40Hz\nrange caused physiological responses and not the magnetic fields.\nThese frequencies resonate and produce secondary harmonics that can\ncause changes in behavior as well. Such as aggression, euphoria,\njumpiness, depression and so on. \n&gt; \n&gt; There is an altered state of consciousness that will give a person\nthe feeling of invisible presences and a heightened sense of paranoia,\nits called the Hypnogogic state and it is usually associated with\nsleep paralysis or the &quot;old hag syndrome&quot;. It can be reached from a\npoint of total relaxation or a type of trance state.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please let me know if you can find those articles, I really am\ninterested in reading them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank R.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; From: psi_research &lt;vilhellm@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Friday, September 28, 2007 12:11:51 PM\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: A new gadget?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;             We&#39;ve been using the K II for about a year and a half\nand they&#39;re ok as a low cost emf \n&gt; \n&gt; detector. Moving any emf meter too fast will likely result in false\npositives but a slow pan \n&gt; \n&gt; across a wall to look for electrical ground leaks will increase\nreliabilty. We look for emf \n&gt; \n&gt; fields in excess of 7 milligause, the K II can detect of to 20\nmilligause. Studies suggest and \n&gt; \n&gt; controlled experiments verify that consistant exposure in excess of\n7 milligause can result \n&gt; \n&gt; in the precieved feeling of being watched or a presense by an unseen\nforce. People \n&gt; \n&gt; sometimes feel it&#39;s an invisible intelligence but really it&#39;s the\nbrains response to the \n&gt; \n&gt; synapse activity.  People sometimes interpret stimuli in a way that\nis familiar, in the case \n&gt; \n&gt; of high emf exposure we think it may be a spirit in the room. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; But that&#39;s not to say the location can&#39;t be haunted as well. It&#39;s\njust that if a particular room \n&gt; \n&gt; has a lot of reported paranormal activity and there is a high emf\nfield then you may want \n&gt; \n&gt; to consider that fact in your evaluation of the location.\nInteresting, there is alternate \n&gt; \n&gt; research that suggest that exposure to substantial emf fields and\nthe resulting increase in \n&gt; \n&gt; nerve ends firing in the brain that genuine psychic abilities are\npossible. This was referred \n&gt; \n&gt; to in the book Spook by Mary Roach.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Any device can be repurposed as a communication tool including the K\nII. While some \n&gt; \n&gt; users believe that the involutary muscle twitches that occur while\nholding down the switch \n&gt; \n&gt; is sort of like what happens when holding a pendulum, others prefer\nto have a selectable \n&gt; \n&gt; on / off switch on their K II. The manufacturer has started offering\nthat option according \n&gt; \n&gt; to some of the local groups that have been selling the modified\nversions on eBay.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -Bill\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Lynn burton &lt;sunplex_chef@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Good morning all,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;       I have used this meter with great success as well as with\ngreat dismay.  I have had \n&gt; \n&gt; the meter &quot;pennied down&quot; sitting on a table top, and have a toy in\nanother room respond \n&gt; \n&gt; to me without any activity on the meter.  I feel it is the spirit&#39;s\nchoice and in which manner \n&gt; \n&gt; it feels more comfortable in communicating with you.  I have had\nlights turn off and back \n&gt; \n&gt; on again in succession in response to questions and no activity on\nthe meter, and then I \n&gt; \n&gt; have had no other responses except the meter, so once again it is\nentirely up to the entity \n&gt; \n&gt; and how it wishes to respond.  In regards to the new apartment\nbuilding, check the history \n&gt; \n&gt; of the land that it sits on.  In a few of my occasions it has been\nthe energy tied to the land \n&gt; \n&gt; or former land owners that has caused the activity.  I have done an\ninvestigation in a &quot;new \n&gt; \n&gt; construction&quot; home site that the family had not moved into yet and\nthe activity was on the \n&gt; \n&gt; increase, the new owners bought this piece of property as a wooded\nlot with\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  no prior establishment being on site, to anyones knowledge that\nis.  To all of our \n&gt; \n&gt; surprise, land records had nothing available for that property other\nthan the location and \n&gt; \n&gt; the pertinent info, however further research and many phone calls\nlater it was discovered \n&gt; \n&gt; that the property sat on the edge of a local Indian tribal\nsettlement from the 1700&#39;s \n&gt; \n&gt; (thanks to the Dept. of the Interior and the Bureau of Native\nAmerican (Indian) Affairs.  It \n&gt; \n&gt; just goes to show you that persistence and continued research pays\noff in the long run \n&gt; \n&gt; ( this one took about 4 months to research).  So Travis just keep\nchecking and get all you \n&gt; \n&gt; can on the property from as far back as you can, you never know what\nyou might fond out.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Lynn Burton\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;!--\n&gt; \n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg {font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean,\nsans-serif;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg table {font-size:inherit;font:100%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg select, input, textarea {font:99% arial, helvetica,\nclean, sans-serif;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg pre, code {font:115% monospace;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg * {line-height:1.22em;}\n&gt; #ygrp-text{\n&gt; font-family:Georgia;\n&gt; }\n&gt; #ygrp-text p{\n&gt; margin:0 0 1em 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-tpmsgs{\n&gt; font-family:Arial;\n&gt; clear:both;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vitnav{\n&gt; padding-top:10px;font-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;margin:0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vitnav a{\n&gt; padding:0 1px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-actbar{\n&gt; clear:both;margin:25px\n0;white-space:nowrap;color:#666;text-align:right;}\n&gt; #ygrp-actbar .left{\n&gt; float:left;white-space:nowrap;}\n&gt; .bld{font-weight:bold;}\n&gt; #ygrp-grft{\n&gt; font-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;padding:15px 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-ft{\n&gt; font-family:verdana;font-size:77%;border-top:1px solid #666;\n&gt; padding:5px 0;\n&gt; }\n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg #logo{\n&gt; padding-bottom:10px;}\n&gt; \n&gt; #ygrp-vital{\n&gt; background-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:2px 0 8px 8px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vital #vithd{\n&gt;\nfont-size:77%;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;color:#333;text-transform:uppercase;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vital ul{\n&gt; padding:0;margin:2px 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vital ul li{\n&gt; list-style-type:none;clear:both;border:1px solid #e0ecee;\n&gt; }\n&gt; #ygrp-vital ul li .ct{\n&gt;\nfont-weight:bold;color:#ff7900;float:right;width:2em;text-align:right;padding-right:.5em;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vital ul li .cat{\n&gt; font-weight:bold;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vital a {\n&gt; text-decoration:none;}\n&gt; \n&gt; #ygrp-vital a:hover{\n&gt; text-decoration:underline;}\n&gt; \n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #hd{\n&gt; color:#999;font-size:77%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov{\n&gt; padding:6px 13px;background-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov ul{\n&gt; padding:0 0 0 8px;margin:0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov li{\n&gt; list-style-type:square;padding:6px 0;font-size:77%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov li a{\n&gt; text-decoration:none;font-size:130%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #nc {\n&gt; background-color:#eee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:0 8px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad{\n&gt; padding:8px 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad #hd1{\n&gt;\nfont-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#628c2a;font-size:100%;line-height:122%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad a{\n&gt; text-decoration:none;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad a:hover{\n&gt; text-decoration:underline;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad p{\n&gt; margin:0;}\n&gt; o {font-size:0;}\n&gt; .MsoNormal {\n&gt; margin:0 0 0 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-text tt{\n&gt; font-size:120%;}\n&gt; blockquote{margin:0 0 0 4px;}\n&gt; .replbq {margin:4;}\n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;      \n____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Tonight&#39;s top picks.
