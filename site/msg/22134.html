=C2=A0 
I have found, it doesn't=
 matter what time of day or where you are physically at, 
the spirits can s=
peak to you through the box.

I use mine for missing person cases, and I do=
n't need to go on site anywhere to 
get reliable information. I prefer to s=
it in my house and ask the spirits for 
help or to get a spirit that can he=
lp me. Going on site is a PIA and is not 
needed.
