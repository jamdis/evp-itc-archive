<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Sorry for the long delay, I get busy at work here at a school 
district in the summer.

 I don&#x27;t use the radiosthe same as most do. As for the 820, instead 
of doing the hack, I cut the trace formthe VT wire, and insert an 
external sweep voltage. Steve m ight be able to give better 
instructions for doing the hack on the 820. 

 I generally don&#x27;t ask questions, but I do all my sessions from 
home. I just announce out loud that I am doing an EVP recording, 
even when I&#x27;m just testing a system, and start recording. &quot;They&quot; 
seem to know when I&#x27;ll turn on a box, and what I need/want to know. 
I have picked up radios in thrift stroes, and when they have 
batteries int them I turn them on, &quot;they&quot; will talk as I spin the 
dial (slowly).  

 There seems to be more than spirits out there. There&#x27;s what&#x27;s 
called ehterics, or Astral entities. It&#x27;s kind of the next level up 
for the physical. That&#x27;s where alot of supposed ET contacts come 
frmm--I think. There also seems to be almost infinite level of 
spirit. 

 For me, it&#x27;s just the voices that keep me intrigued.
