<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>They could have had it on AM regular mode, not AM wide.  AM wide pulls in a lot of radio, but AM regular mode only pulls in a few.  Also, i think i heard somebody say they were wrapping it in tin foil to make a faraday cage.

Not sure about that, because you can&#x27;t see it in the video.

&gt; I wonder why her radio doesn&#x27;t seem to have any static it&#x27;s like they say a 
&gt;  word or two, then it&#x27;s silent and then another word, i wonder if she is 
&gt; using it  in FM or AM, on the RS 12-125, yes, I have one of those, it&#x27;s my 
&gt; best of the  radio&#x27;s, i like it because i can change the bass treble, and it 
&gt; doesn&#x27;t have as  much static, but it&#x27;s no where as clear as hers.  sf

&gt; It says in the comments below, that they were using a 12-150 shack  hack. I 
&gt; believe you already have one of those radios.
