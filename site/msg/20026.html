<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>yeah, that&#x27;s for sure.

These things have happened in the past over the decades. The past
occurrences noted were probably due to natural phenomena. This one
could be, also. I wonder if anyone has performed autopsies on the dead
birds and determined anything? And if they&#x27;re allowed to publish the
results?

&gt;&gt; I have seen speculation of testing of an electromagnetic weapon such as
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; millimeter-wave devices talked about a year or so ago in various places.
&gt;&gt; These would be aimed at a specific target area that would not be too big.
&gt;&gt; It
&gt;&gt; would not be noticed by anyone.
