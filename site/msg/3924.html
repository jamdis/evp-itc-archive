Thanks for the validation.   I am using the sweeping band uploading directly into adobe audition 1.5.  I believe its similar to your methods.  I however like to have the audio continually run through the series of questions, due to the fact sometimes they do not answer immediately to the question or more than one voice seems to chime in.
   
  I have also come to discover that sometimes when I am asking a direct question, that prior to me finishing they also answer before I am done.  Which leads me to believe that they somehow know what I am going to ask.
   
  My daughter who is 10 walked into my office yesterday, only to have the unit say "Hi Alexxis".  She is amazed that they in fact knew who she was just by walking into the room and not saying a word.
