Then, &quot;Rj&quot; and friend filled in the skeptic gap, big time.  \n\nI deal with enough critics and skeptics in the rest of my work. I don&#39;t work nearly as well when I&#39;m upset, and fretting because someone has insulted me (or my intelligence) or someone I respect, like Frank.\n\nI&#39;m learning that insulating myself allows me to focus on my work. If that&#39;s what I have to do... well, that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do.\n\nI&#39;ve been in &quot;wait and see&quot; mode here, in case there are yet more critics and skeptics who&#39;ll fill in the &quot;Rj&quot; gap.  I want to believe that everything&#39;s okay now, but I&#39;m still stinging from recent negative comments, on and off of this list.\n\nBut mostly, I&#39;m about to leave for my biggest annual gig, in a field that&#39;s become more land mines than safe paths.  Between the anxiety and the pre-event preps, I&#39;m in lurk mode here... and I&#39;ll be offline entirely for most of the first two weeks of September.\n\nSo, those are the reasons why I&#39;ve been quiet.\n\nIn haste,\nFiona \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Soooo, the skeptic types are responsible for most of the dialog?  Weird,\n&gt; you&#39;d think more would feel safer posting and commenting. Get rid of the\n&gt; ones that accept no evidence, can&#39;t test, ignore all of our resutls, can&#39;t\n&gt; hear and acuse us of halucinating this and---dead silence.
