<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce &amp; All, I&#x27;ll have to visit my local Walgreens; to check these mini-speakers! I saw the same ones, at Longs Drug store but for about $10 or so! I found, yesterday, for $1. at a thrift store, &quot;Hi-Fi Mini-Speakers for Sterio receiver &amp; cassette by Tectron&quot; Model HT-12    www.tectronint.com which I found helps a tiny bit to increase the volume rather than the other ones I&#x27;ve been using. Seems both need to have the RS Hack 469 turned to MAX volume though!!  =Judy=                                                         --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:

&gt; hey guy&#x27;s these speakers are about three inches long. they are not very 
&gt; powerfull but get the job done, they take 2 aaa batteries to run and 
&gt; plug right into the top of th RS 12-469. I bought them at a burlington 
&gt; coat factory for 4.99
&gt; 
&gt; I will try to find them on line and post the url.
&gt; there is a pic in the photo section in the Bruce folder.
