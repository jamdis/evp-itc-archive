Not to mention \nit is the last place where living humans were quickly lost.  Just \nimagine the amount of energy that must be imprinted on that exact \nspot.\n\nThat is where I hoped to gain a better understanding of that energy \nwhich is imprinted... and I must say, I think I have done just that.\n\nToday I processed a number of the files I captured from the impact \npoint using numerous devices of the non-microphone type.  After I put \neach of these files through a four step process (which I&#39;ll explain \nin great detail in my video), I was able to listen to some amazing, \nand very relivent sounds.\nMy wife was so upset after I told her what I had heard, she refused \nto listen to the audio.\n\nLet me just say... the combination I used was able to capture a very \nchilling scene.  One I just have to believe were the last moments of \nthose who perished.\n\nOnce I publish the final results, I hope others will be able to \nverify what I am hearing...\n\nI&#39;m figuring to put a multi-part video on my Youtube page.  One part \nexplaining what will be seen an heard, as well as describing the \nevents of that day.  Another part with my sessions at the various \nlocations, using various methods.  And a final part with the audio of \nthe researchers who assisted with this experiment using the debris I \nsent each of them.\n\nBottom line... I really do believe that energy is imprinted in \nobjects, and at locations where energy was strong at a time of \nimprint.\n\nHappy Holidays to all.... have a safe and fun Holiday Season!\n\n- Mike C.

It seems kirlian photography captures certain\n&gt; &gt; types of energy on film. In the demonstration a picture of a \nhouse \n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; shown. Later that same house had a fire and part of the house had \n&gt; been\n&gt; &gt; burned to the ground but the photo taken with kirlian photography\n&gt; &gt; later showed that part of the house still there.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m no expert but maybe energy we can&#39;t see leaves an imprint in \nthe\n&gt; &gt; non physical universe and can be viewed or demonstrated using the\n&gt; &gt; right instruments and technique. Of course I really have no clue \nand\n&gt; &gt; am fascinated by the evp and itc phenomena.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Enjoyed visiting your site, thanks for the link.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Richard"}
