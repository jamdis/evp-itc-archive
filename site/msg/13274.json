I hope someone else can find it, as I&#39;ve\nlooked around there and really don&#39;t see what you&#39;ve described.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thought I had it in a file but cannot find. Be clear on this\nhowever, it was a test with parameters similar to what you suggested.\nNot simply comments as you implied. Again, if you take time to\nresearch that site you will find much to look at. Maybe Margaret (I\nshe reads this) knows the date, etc. because she is an active member\nthere as she is here with many posts of her evp sessions. good luck ron\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Reality Is Your Idea\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 1/17/09, Rick &lt;rasterer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Rick &lt;rasterer@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Need volenters for validation experiment\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Saturday, January 17, 2009, 12:11 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Oh ok. I didn&#39;t realize is was just some ocmments at that site,\n&gt; rather than a more formal study. So thanks anyways.

Count me in on the test. By the way, some here might\n&gt; be interested in knowing that the American Association of EVP did a\n&gt; similar blind test and their results showed about a 33% hit rate for\n&gt; people getting the same words from a file. That would be a pretty\n&gt; good number to match, I would think.

I have a couple\nfiles \n&gt; &gt; that I feel are pretty clear. So if you would like to volunteer just \n&gt; &gt; send me an email with your email adress and I will send you a file\nnot \n&gt; &gt; too long but it will be unedited and in its original form.\n&gt; &gt; I will not amplify it or edit or change it in anyway from its\noriginal. \n&gt; &gt; Those who recive the files do the same NO editing untill you render \n&gt; &gt; your opinion to me about it after that you can do what u like with it.\n&gt; &gt; Remember after listening email me DO NOT post what you hear on the \n&gt; &gt; board I will do that later when I have everyones opinion.\n&gt; &gt; Mike W\n&gt; &gt; nightparanormalrese arch@yahoo. com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
