my life as I am about this.

Thank you, Mike, for the info.

I listened to your shows, too, and liked them very much.

&gt; Hi Ann,
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m happy for your happy news! Looks like more and more people are
&gt; taking possession of the many different boxes now available. I look
&gt; forward to reading about your adventures with your new Mini Box.
&gt; Looking at their website, it appears the box already might have the
&gt; jack you&#x27;re asking about. The box has three connectors on the front,
&gt; (Mic, Recorder, and Speaker) Looks like the output is already tapped
&gt; off in two places, one for the speaker and one for the recorder. I&#x27;m
&gt; guessing the mic jack is so you can interface for a session, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Let us know how your works...
&gt;
&gt; - Mike

&gt; &gt; Is the speaker all I need or any kind of jack? For it?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Steve, will also ask Lisa if she&#x27;s aware of the &quot;technician&quot; who
&gt; will
&gt; &gt; hopefully be assisting me? I just want to get confirmation or
&gt; &gt; rejection of what I seem to be sensing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Ann,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I went to radio shack and bought a speaker model #21-549 and it
&gt; seems
&gt; &gt; &gt; to work fine. I got mine yesterday and didn&#x27;t seem to thrilled
&gt; about
&gt; &gt; &gt; the results and gave another try tonight. Tonight, i spoke to
&gt; several
&gt; &gt; &gt; different people in their own voices and really have to give
&gt; credit to
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike and Lisa for making this communication keep getting better.
&gt; This
&gt; &gt; &gt; really is another valuable box in my research, as long as
&gt; different
&gt; &gt; &gt; designs become available i will test them all. Every box is unique
&gt; &gt; &gt; and offers different results, but they all work off the same
&gt; premise
&gt; &gt; &gt; of raw audio bits. Real time communication is finally here and
&gt; gets
&gt; &gt; &gt; better every day, some day&#x27;s frank&#x27;s box is better and than some
&gt; day&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; RS box...etc. Depends on your surroundings, your mood, the weather
&gt; &gt; &gt; but all these devices have worked for me up to this point and i&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; &gt; grateful.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; p.s.--here is the link to the speaker so you can get a visual.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Your going to love this wild ride and watching new people get
&gt; involved
&gt; &gt; &gt; and posted results makes it all worth it for me.
