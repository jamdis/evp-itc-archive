<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello,

I&#x27;m Ann and Bruce woke me up. ;)

I think you should just let this whole thing go. It&#x27;s not your Karma,  
first of all, and second, there are some people--like me--who with  
all the written knowledge of the universe still could not hack a  
12-249 or any other model of Radio Shackeque device. Those people  
need someone else to do it for them. Period. If they need to turn to  
someone on eBay, then so be it. They will pay what they think its  
worth to them. I personally paid $400 for one of the first miniboxes.  
I have no regrets at all and feel that in no way I was unjustly bled.

I think that the proper position for me, personally, is to not  
attempt to make a profit on this research or any mediumistic activity  
I have done or will do. However, it is not my place to say what is  
right for others--moreover to go on a vendetta against them. The  
feedback these people have received indicate that the buyers were  
happy with the transactions. Maybe they couldn&#x27;t hack their own or  
find someone to do it for them. My only issue with what they&#x27;ve done  
is using the term Frank&#x27;s box in their description. But if Frank has  
no problem with it, then how can I?

If you want to become a box supplier at no profit on Ebay, however,  
knock yourself out. It&#x27;s wonderful altruism and I salute you.

HMO only. And nice to meet you.:)

Ann

&gt; Hi Kay,
&gt;
&gt; That was what I posted on my original idea over a week ago and I  
&gt; was blasted about it especially that I would look like a fool that  
&gt; I was willing to take a loss of a few bucks.  But atleast the  
&gt; hacking information and links would have been posted on ebay for  
&gt; all to see.

&gt; I checked to see what it would cost to sell one of ebay. To list it
&gt; it is $1.00 for $25.00-449.00 plus 8.75% of the initial $25.00
&gt; ($2.19), plus 3.50% of the remaining closing value balance ($25.01
&gt; to $1,000.00)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I would be willing to list the one I have plus give the information
&gt; on the free hacking and that fact that you can get one at Radio
&gt; Shack for $24.99 just to shut this guy down. At the most I would be
&gt; out $1.00 to not sell it!!!! Well worth it I&#x27;d say.
&gt;
&gt; Can someone send me the written instructions on how to hack the 12-
&gt; 249.

&gt; &gt; Either that, or anyone willing to make them for $25 + shipping
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; no profit? You could then list them just like the ones that are
&gt; &gt; selling...so they pull up identical to the listings that are up
&gt; &gt; there. :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; I was thinking if someone would list a FREE DOWNLOAD of
&gt; &gt; instructions for the various hacks
&gt; &gt; &gt; on the Radio Shack units, it could put an end to the business
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; sellers that are taking
&gt; &gt; &gt; advantage of people who are unaware that they could probably
&gt; hack
&gt; &gt; the units for
&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen &quot;downloads&quot; of various things listed before. Why
&gt; not
&gt; &gt; this?
