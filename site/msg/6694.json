The communication with Frank&#39;s Box has always been my favorite.  The more boxes I hear and work with, I still have to say it&#39;s Frank&#39;s Box hands down.  \n   \n  I mentioned last week the difference in pitch and formatted responses from the Mini Box and the RS Hacked.  The only 2 box&#39;s that I do not have to pull out the 2 way communication is Frank&#39;s and Joe&#39;s.  Nothing like an oldie but a goodie!!!  Frank&#39;s is brillant indeed!!!\n   \n  Juli\n   \n   \n   \n  \n\nurkel23@... wrote:\n             \n  I have been having weird sessions with Frank&#39;s Box #27, but in a good way.  They told me to change the antenna, which it did and the random started working and never has on this box.  They told me tonight to put the old antenna back on and the sessions keep getting better and better.  I dragged Juli and Joel in on what i believed and felt was going to be a great box session and here is a file only a couple minutes in to our hour long session.  This is a bit rough sounding, but hearing it live is pretty clear and you can hear me respond and than Joel agrees that he heard it too.  My sessions are pretty incredible since the random mode started working on the FB#27 and i feel the random is the best thing out there...hands down.  I have done Sessions on the internet through Skype all week and i feel the energy between Juli and I are really bringing them through clearly.  I only use FB#27 now in random mode and it is the best feature on any box, between the white noise, echo\n and random there is no competetion up to this point.  The hacks are good, but nothing is better than an original frank&#39;s box.  Our friends on the other side told me that they fixed the random mode to go and teach others and i am going to a meeting on wednesday to demonstrate the different boxes and our friend made a promise to come though if i go....so we will see.\n   \n  Here is one of the files i got so far.\n   \n  -Steve H.\n\n\n\n    \n---------------------------------\n  Who&#39;s never won?
