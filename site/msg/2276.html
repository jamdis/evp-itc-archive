 This is from the 2nd of September, so the time is just a week or so away,=
 if it's true--big if!
I hear "...unleashes Val-cain-oe...", and "..unleash=
es Al-quaida...", can't tell which is correct, or if it matters. 
 I think =
the ambiguity is intentional on "their" part.  Which is one reason why I sa=
y this "evidence" is dubious at best(but not unreal!). Not only is the comm=
unication unnecessarily unclear, but the information often inacurate, and o=
ften just false. People try to read too much into this stuff, which makes i=
t even more subject to manipulation by that unknown something, which makes =
me less than enthusiastic about supplying "tools" to access that unknown le=
vel out there. The box users out there already seem to on an unalterable co=
urse of the down hill slide into the dark, and I don't know why, nor do the=
y consider me worthy to listen to. I think they all want to be TAPS. It's s=
ubtle, but starts maybe with those little tidbits slipped in, like the dubi=
ous nature of another box user's personality, then slowly creeps into the e=
go. I, being the "first box user" am well aware of the manipulative nature =
of this "other side", and I don't think it's confined to box users, all doi=
ng spiritual or EVP work are subject to the darker side. Now, after about 4=
0 years of study, I can understand why it's not wise for the unintiated to =
attempt this work, and why the angels constantly say "just stop it!", as th=
ey told me for years, and still do. It is also very unwise to expose the un=
intiated to this stuff. Initiated meaning that certain level of understandi=
ng that's hard to describe. Perhaps the wrong word?
 You can choose to igno=
re all the warnings, as I do, but you better be 100% honest, with yourself =
especially! You can't afford an ego either.
