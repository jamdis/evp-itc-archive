<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ann and I both made private comments to each other about 
the &quot;negative&quot; energy, for lack of knowing what it was. I think it&#x27;s 
still hangin&#x27; around, but not as strong. I&#x27;ve had to bite the be-
jeeeses out of my tongue lately.

&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ralph here again. Seems every time I come back on to leave a 
message
&gt; &gt; there&#x27;s some bickering going on. I can&#x27;t leave you people for a 
minute
&gt; &gt; without some hoopla going on LOL (just Kidding). Well how ya&#x27;ll 
doing ?
&gt; 
&gt; There seemed to be something happening all around over the last 
few days 
&gt; or week.  It wasn&#x27;t just here.  I am on 62 Yahoogroups and almost 
all of 
&gt; them broke out in arguing and bickering at the same time. I have 
NEVER 
&gt; seen that happen! And one of my favorite area bands had some 
really 
&gt; bizarre and unpleasant things happen at a show on Saturday night. 
And we 
&gt; had three earthquakes here. Some thought all of these events were 
caused 
&gt; by the full moon.  I dunno, it was still very odd but seems to 
have passed 
&gt; now. Lives are retue=rning to normal.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Fine I hope. I have been busy with my Paranormal Group and
&gt; &gt; investigations and Gettysburg. I was in Gettysburg over this past
&gt; &gt; weekend and got an EVP in the Triagular Field that said &quot; Never 
trust
&gt; &gt; Abe Lincoln &quot; LOL must have been a Rebel soldier. I thought that 
was
&gt; &gt; pretty cool.
&gt; 
&gt; It also could&#x27;ve been a Union soldier who didn&#x27;t like his outcome!
&gt; 
&gt; I really want to get the chance to visit Gettysburg.  I am pretty 
sure 
&gt; Batleground, Indiana (the site of the Battle of Tippecanoe in 
1811) is 
&gt; haunted by some of the former soldiers.  I&#x27;ve been to that one 
many times 
&gt; but never tried to get any EVP there.
