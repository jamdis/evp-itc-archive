<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Clara... I forgot to add about the Radio Shack units... if you decided to go with 
automated sweep, you can pick up one of three current models at a RS retail outlet, or 
order online:  20-125, 12-820, or 12-469 (the 469 is my least favorite model as it makes 
an annoying click-click-clicking as it sweeps ... none of the other models do this).

If you should happen to see an old 12-469 (grey/white, not all white) that works well, as 
does the old 12-470 (grey/white, not all black).  The new all black 12-470 isn&#x27;t hackable.  
Please don&#x27;t pay crazy prices for either of these models, as the currently available ones 
work perfectly well.

The hack is pretty much the same... open them up and snip the wire running to the &#x27;mute.&#x27;  
On the 12-469 you can snip, or bend, the mute pin.  And there&#x27;s videos on YouTube that 
can help you through the modification process.  Really, it&#x27;s pretty simple.

This will make it so the units continuously sweep through the channels for you.  I find that 
manual sweep (at least for me) produces longer, clearer responses often in a single tone 
of voice, but the shack hacks can produce some pretty amazing material as well.

Let us know what you decide to try and how you do with it.  :-)

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I am Clara and I live in Central California. I have been a paranormal
&gt; investigator since 2006 and I have been very fortunate to record many
&gt; messages with digital and analog voice recorders.
&gt; 
&gt; Within my investigative groups, I have always been the EVP tech. I
&gt; have discovered that there are many more angles to EVP than just
&gt; straight recording.
&gt; 
&gt; I joined your group to learn more and boy I have been so fascinated
&gt; with all the talk among you all with your equipment.
&gt; 
&gt; How should I start? Who can give me some good advice on what I should
&gt; try next? I am not gifted to be able to build things, maybe unless
&gt; they are very easy.
&gt; 
&gt; I would travel (with time to plan it) if I was able to learn more
&gt; about other methods for capturing evp.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for your time to read my message and hopefully you can help me.
