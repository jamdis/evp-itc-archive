But, they did use the itc video looping\nmethod live as well as with the session on the radio.\nThats all I could gather.\nThey seem to have archived footage as well at the site after you\nregister. \nI hope that helps. Let me know what the files give I sent ya.\nTC and thanks for being kind. \n\nLK\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; LK:  Hi!\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a question for you:  Who was doing the session, btw, and what \n&gt; box did they use?  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope you get better!!\n&gt; \n&gt; LC\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, LauraKimberley1@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Hi LC,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes I recorded the session in part about 1 hrs worth.
