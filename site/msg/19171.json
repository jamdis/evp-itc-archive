The only thing that we do know is\nthat there is a correlation between spikes in EMF&#39;s and paranormal events.\n I have used various meters during GB sessions and there is a correlation at\ntimes, but this has to be discounted solely because a radio uses part of the\nEMF spectrum.\n\nIt is theorized that EMF measurements are to be taken solely in DC current\nbecause it is natural electricity.  So any EMF meter you have that measures\nAC is worthless on an investigation because it picks up man made\nelectricity.  As for the range, well that is also speculative at best.  The\nmost current theories hold that under 30 Hz DC is where you will find the\nmost paranormal activity.  This is because the Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta\nbrainwaves of a human are all below 30 Hz.  This is where the Body Electric\nfires and consciousness is formed.  If we are dealing with a continuation of\nconsciousness, results are more apt to be found in this range.\n Interestingly enough, the earth vibrates in this same range with 5 standing\nwaves at or below 33Hz (Shuman Resonance), so it appears that the new agers\nare right when they say we vibrate with the Earth.\n\nBut, as always, no one knows for sure.  And no one knows if these\nfrequencies have anything to do with what we receive in GBC.\n\nOn Tue, Nov 9, 2010 at 5:10 AM, Adriana Jones &lt;adrianamjones@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This has probably already been discussed a hundred times over by people\n&gt; building ghost boxes, but... what&#39;s the average emf range of ghosts... and\n&gt; would creating sounds in that emf range make it easier for the ghosts to\n&gt; communicate?
