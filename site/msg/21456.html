&gt;  Doing ghost hunts most are going into old, usually abandoned, not
&gt; maintained--or cleaned buildings. There&#x27;s mold, dust, dirt, insects, rat and
&gt; mouse droppings that contain viruses and bacteria, lead based paint,
&gt; asbestos, radon, and who knows what other toxins. No one takes any
&gt; precautions, they get this stuff in their hair, clothes, and cars, then
&gt; bring it home to their children, freinds and families, then wonder why the
&gt; kids are getting wierd deseases. Who is going to pay your health bills, the
&gt; property owners, the event promoters? I don&#x27;t think so! Still think it&#x27;s all
&gt; fun and games, a quest for fame and fortune?
&gt; 
&gt;  I wouldn&#x27;t go ghost hunting without a full hasmat suit, including a
&gt; respirator!
&gt; 
&gt;  Just tell yourselves I don&#x27;t know anything, bring your pregnant wife on
&gt; your hunts, or your newborns--couldn&#x27;t hurt--right?
