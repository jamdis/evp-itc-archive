<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My thoughts exactly Stefan.  I was wondering on how he hooked
allophones and the emf together.  That&#x27;s a hell of an idea.  I&#x27;m
working on a few detection type boxes that I only want to run when
someone is near and not all the time.  

I&#x27;ll be glad to post my information too for everyone once I get it all
worked out.

&gt; Yeah, and I&#x27;d be interested in the schemtics, especially the EMF part.
&gt; How did you map the EMF field intensity/frequency/whatever to the
&gt; individual allophones?
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m also looking forward to some audio clips with direct 2-way
&gt; communication. :)

&gt; &gt; This sounds pretty interesting.  Can you send some more info or a
link?
&gt; &gt; Thanks,

&gt; &gt;&gt; Just finished box number 3.  And yes that&#x27;s a trifield meter
built in.
&gt; &gt;&gt;  It seems to work great.  Once the meter shows any EMF field at all
&gt; &gt;&gt; the box starts to spit out the allophones.  The meter also has a very
&gt; &gt;&gt; sensitive antenna and it is tied together with the
&gt; &gt;&gt;  A to D converter antenna that I use to get the emf into the box.
&gt; &gt;&gt; This is by far the most sensitive of the three boxes.  If you are
&gt; &gt;&gt; building your own just let me know if you need any info.  I will of
&gt; &gt;&gt; course upload audio files as I get them.  I did have a few headaches
&gt; &gt;&gt; with this box as I am driving the LM386 all the way up.  Somehow the
&gt; &gt;&gt; audio was getting back into the negative bus!  Took a couple hours to
&gt; &gt;&gt; get the right capacitor for the ground shunt.  Funny though as it
&gt; &gt;&gt; worked great on the breadboard but once I soldered it together
&gt; &gt;&gt; UHHHGGG.  I think I will hang onto this one  for a while.  I have
&gt; &gt;&gt; young lady in mind that is doing very promising work so I guess she
&gt; &gt;&gt; gets box # 1.
