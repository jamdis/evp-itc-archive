Hey Guys & Gals
   
  I am thinking about buying a P. Puck, and I was wandering how the research is going?  Is it all crack up to be, and do you really think it works?  I have listen to a couple of files from Steve, and it all sounds good.
   
  What I'm wandering is can anybody explain in regular people terms on how does the P. Puck work.  The way I took it was that their are all types of words in the puck and spirits use those words to form sentences.  Is that correct or am I totally wrong.  Please let me know.
