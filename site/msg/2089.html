<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Years ago, when I was taping on a reel to reel, mostly, I often got  
voices that sounded maddeningly not like me, but like people I knew  
who were not dead. They never identified themselves as those people,  
but the voices were dead ringers (ar ar ar).  I am also, apparently,  
able to randomly project my voice into the minds of people I know. It  
begins to happen to almost everyone that I bond strongly with. I  
can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have heard someone I know spin around  
and say, &quot;What?&quot; They always say they hear my voice, but don&#x27;t  
understand what I am saying. This is always accompanied, on my end,  
by a sort of ringing sound in my head. I cannot control it at all.  
I&#x27;m just throwing this out there as food for thought that may pertain  
to your discussion.....

&gt; Very true, Frank! The ghosts who are producing the EVP&#x27;s certainly  
&gt; don&#x27;t
&gt; have brains. :-)
&gt;
&gt; I have no doubt that there may be a few people around who could  
&gt; create EVP
&gt; phenomena in an electrronic device, but it would be an extremely small
&gt; number. I think most of the EVP we get are from disembodied beings who
&gt; have figured out how to do it.

&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s not brain! We are all spirit, of course we can create our  
&gt; own EVPs. You don&#x27;t suddenly become spirit when you die, you just  
&gt; wake up. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t ask questions, I don&#x27;t want to create  
&gt; the answers I&#x27;m looking for.
