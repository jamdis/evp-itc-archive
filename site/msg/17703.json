You have no interest in truth, facts or science. \n\n Nuff said!\n\n Frank-s\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lizzie Broden &lt;yahuli69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank, you didnt let me post and took away my rights to do so.  You got no room to talk about such things.\n&gt; \n&gt; And even as of last night you posted that you were going to leave the board.  Yet here we are?\n&gt; \n&gt; Shit or get off the pot Frank!  Manke up your mind!  Do what you say and say what you mean!  Grow some balls!  Man up!\n&gt; \n&gt;  &quot;Nature is showing us only the tail of the lion, but I have no doubt that the lion belongs to it even though, because of its large size, it cannot totally reveal itself all at once.&quot; \n&gt; -&quot; Albert Einstein \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;It is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusions, however satisfying and reassuring.&quot;\n&gt; --Carl Sagan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;There is no such thing as an insignificant detail.

This one convinced I&#39;m out to form a group of groupies, and she ignores all else.\n&gt; \n&gt; Guess we are not allowed to question out loud, or throw thoughts and theories out there for the consideration and comment of others. Sorry, not being from &quot;here&quot; I didn&#39;t learn all the social taboos of this primitive culture. I tried goose stepping once, it made my ankles hurt.\n&gt; \n&gt; I took the skeptics off moderation in a mistaken effort to be fair, but all this does is disrupt the conversation about what these voices are, and how to hear it and interpret it better. This group is not about how to explain all the inconvenient truths away. \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;"}
