Been \ninterested in the paranormal for as long as I can remember. Was \nrecently in an investigation group but the leader was a very pushy, \nobnoxious individual that basically scared everyone off. Anyway...\n\nI was listening to some of the files. Nice work! However some of them \nwon&#39;t open, when I try to open some of them I get a message that \nsays &quot;Windows Media Player cannot find the file&quot; or cannot open the \nfile something like that...anyone know why some files play and others \nwon&#39;t? \n\nAlso...I am interested in capturing EVPs myself. However I don&#39;t have \nmuch equipment. \n\nI have a computer of course, and a pair of stereo quality headphones \nwith microphone attached (like the kind a call center would use) My \ncomputer is right next to our air conditioner so that could provide \nthe &quot;white noise&quot; \n\nCould I possibly record with nothing more than a headphone mouthpiece \nand a freeware program like Audacity? Or do I need something more \nextensive? \n\nAlso are there any risks of doing EVP in one&#39;s home? I don&#39;t suspect \nparanormal activity here but I read Tom and Lisa Butler&#39;s book &quot;There \nis No Death and There are No Dead&quot; where they talk about making \ncontact with &quot;The Other Side&quot; even in locations that are \nnot &quot;haunted&quot; such as one&#39;s home. \n\nAny suggestions, tips, advice, input would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks! \nAngela"}
