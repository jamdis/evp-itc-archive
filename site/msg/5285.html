<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for the fast reply, Bruce!  Definitely something to add to my 
notes for further examination.

&gt; Sharon,
&gt;  
&gt; In my experience through research, most of the time mike will wait 
for a masculine fragment or signal
&gt; and lisa will wait for a feminine one. I believe they try to answer 
in the apropriate gender so that I 
&gt; don&#x27;t get confused about who is answering. Sometimes I will get a 
response or message that is made 
&gt; up of both male and female voices together, even in the same word 
sometimes but very rarely.
&gt;  
&gt; And I think when that occurs it&#x27;s because they lose the particular 
fragment midstream and pick up 
&gt; whatever is available at that instant to complete the message , 
word or phrase.
&gt;  
&gt; I hope this answers your question and please keep asking them. It 
forces me to formulate an answer
&gt; and you to further your knowledge as a researcher. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s 
all about.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Bruce,Is it common to receive a response comprised of a mixture of 
men and women sound bytes/voices (like I heard in this one)? My guess 
is that we hear predominantly male voices because they&#x27;re more male 
radio announcers. Therefore, does the entity who announces herself to 
you as Lisa come through with a male voice at times (because those 
are the voices that she gets most of the time to formulate a 
response)? Please tell me if my reasoning here is way off 
base...Thanks,Sharon--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-
