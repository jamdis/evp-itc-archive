I think this group has been over run by debunker/skeptics and any discussion has become impossible. They will tell everyone it&#39;s just imagination, except in rare ocassions so they can maintain some credibilty. I don&#39;t know where everyone else has gone, but they never comment. Guess the rest just want only ghost hunter related stuff, and igore all else.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  f-S\n&gt;"}
