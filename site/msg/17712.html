<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You just go to &quot;Edit membership&quot; at the top of the group page, and leave group. This stuff totally voluutary!

 I was trying in a very ineffective way to address what the skeptics say, but they accect no evidence, and  what we hear in our recordings is completely dismissed.  I don&#x27;t do like most other groups and require members to only discuss the group topic. 

 I have been banned from groups for posting voices that were not ghost hunter enough, or had a swear word. Everyone thinks they know better.

&gt; Please remove me from this group. I am asking most respectfully. There is so much contention, outright animosity and name calling the topic goes from being about the EVP&#x27;s to personal attacks on such a regular basis there is almost no space for what this group is truly about. The negative energies are too much for me. 
&gt;  
&gt; I truly hope, Frank, you get the support you need and deserve to further your research. I see how passionate you are about this and my wish for you is one day you won&#x27;t need to prove to others how exactly correct you are about the voices of those speaking from the other side. I know they are speaking. I have many EVP&#x27;s that have been proven correct. They are clear and concise. Mine were from using a voice recorder. Frank, I believe you.
&gt;  
&gt; I won&#x27;t argue and beleaguer the point. No, it is not from a place of &quot; oh you just can&#x27;t stand up under scrutiny,&quot; it is from the place of all of this sidetracking and negativity is useless. I have no need to prove myself or the recordings. The families for whom they were done proved it. Clear voices. Clear messages. 
&gt;  
&gt; Some individuals feel the need to argue everything endlessly due to the need to feel superior and always right. Some individuals do it due to a lack of self esteem and they feel superior when putting others down, making rude challenges, pushing the envelope and manipulating a situation to appear as superior when in fact they are not.
&gt;  
&gt; I need nor want none of this in my life and choose to be removed.

&gt; Take every chance you get because some things only happen once...

&gt;  You keep repeating yourself, you keep ignoring all facts, you keep ingore what everyone here gets, and you keep implying all of us are somehow brain damaged, and you keep attacking me personally, making this all about &quot;my cult&quot;,  and you keep repeating yourself,  saying the same thing over and over, ignoring all facts, and implying we are all idiots that don&#x27;t bow down to your superior intellect. 
&gt;  Sciecne, science, science--so since when is science all about ignoring all facts and making the results fit preconcieved notions.  That means ideal science, not the bought and paid crap in this country where you an pay science to get any result you want.  The science where first you decide what is true, then beat everyone to death that doesn&#x27;t buy into it, and that&#x27;s not cultish.

&gt; &gt; sooooo, is pareidolia just an auditory thing, or does that apply to reading as well?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This stuff ain&#x27;t gospel, as I&#x27;ve said over and over, it gets confusing. We get messages and information that can often be validated, which is enough to &quot;prove&quot; to most of us that something is going on, but it seems to evaporate when one tries to pin it down. Just this moring I hear a &quot;voice&quot; from tape talking about the 17th, &quot; you&#x27;ll be making a big jump&quot;, back the tape up, and hear rhe same voice &quot;quit making all the jokes&quot;--so, which is it?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As for the 17th, I&#x27;ve learned not to hold my breath waiting for something to land. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I get more than alittle annoyed by people that act like this stuff is all cut and dried, all perfectly understood, and known--all easily explained.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You claim I don&#x27;t listen to any of this stuff because I can&#x27;t take the chance I might hear something.Ã‚Â  I do listen to some of them.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  I hear stuff.Ã‚Â  But I don&#x27;t hear anything that I can&#x27;t explain by simple pareidolia or random radio transmissions. So you&#x27;re wrong there.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, to try to control for my own pareidolia, that is why I suggest the files not be labeled or explained.Ã‚Â  That would help make listening to them a little less likely to be influenced by the perceptions of others, or made to &quot;fit their personal expectation&quot; as you noted.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I continue to be at a loss as to why Frank is so defensive when people disagree with him.Ã‚Â  If I don&#x27;t listen or comment, Frank attacks me.Ã‚Â  If I do listen and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; comment, Frank attacks me.Ã‚Â  Is there no room for individuality and personal opinion?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I got your two cents! Post the freaking voice, unlabeled and not even a comment from the self proclaimed science dorks. Won&#x27;t even give it try, to GD busy telling everyone what this stuff really is. Y0ou can&#x27;t even listen to any of this stuff cuz yopu can not takle the chance you might hear someyhting. The rest, they are so locked up in the ghost hunter mentality they can&#x27;t hear anything else.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t care if no one hear this shit, but not listen, or to say it said something else! That is number one probelm wiht this craop, everyone wnats it to fit their personal expectations, and only they can be the world&#x27;s expert.
&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My two cents then:Ã&#x27;â€šÃ‚Â  it depends on the purpose of the announcement how best to go about the experiment.Ã&#x27;â€šÃ‚Â  If the purpose is to confirm to yourself or others that this was a valid prediction, or be able to make a case for there being something to this ITC stuff, or to have a prediction you can wave in the face of them darned skepdicks, then specifics have to be presented before the event.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If the purpose is not to do any of those things, but just try to see for yourself &#x27;what works&#x27;, then it doesn&#x27;t much matter whether you give details after the event, or even bothering announcing the event at all.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So the only confusing part is why announce the event at all, if no details are given before it takes place?Ã&#x27;â€šÃ‚Â  Besides, if the details might help save someone from harm, it would be really a bad thing to do to keep them to yourself, wouldn&#x27;t it?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, if I thought I was getting predictions of future events that might cause harm to someone, I&#x27;d be posting those details far and wide, in the hope of helping who I can.Ã&#x27;â€šÃ‚Â  Not doing that... well, I just hope the person doesn&#x27;t believe in karma.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, here&#x27;s my two cents:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If we want to rule out as much &quot;observer&quot; interference -- whether PK or whatever -- the fewer details we know, the better.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, I&#x27;m happy with a date, period. I trust Frank&#x27;s integrity to tell me if the event (if any happens) is a reasonable match, or not.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;d rather stumble onto the event on my own, than be accused of trying to mold the event -- or selectively focus on just certain aspects of it -- to fit criteria known ahead of time.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That&#x27;s why I like things like the PEAR project (aka Global Consciousness Project); it&#x27;s just numbers. If and how it correlates.. . that&#x27;s what gets interesting.
