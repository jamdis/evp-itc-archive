<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, I have listened to him on Coast to Coast AM before.  He was never 
able to explain how his levitation of objects worked.  The military was 
interested in his experiments...but could never dulicate the effects.  
Not sure where he is with things, now, other than selling his videos.

I can&#x27;t believe you posted this, as I was just thinking of him 
(especially his workshop and connecting it with Frank S for some 
reason) in the last day or so.  Coincidence? Probably not.
