Yep April you are right. Remaining open to the possibility is hard enough f=

everyone comes to the same conclusions or gets the exact same results. Mayb=

I tend to use a variety of methods. When voic=
es come from things such as water or out of thin air sometimes its a easier=
 for some to believe there is something there that they were not aware of.
=

But again they have to prove it for themselves to be able to have that eye=
 opening moment.
=A0
I only comment on what I hear or dont hear. My speaker=
 set up is a bit different than most. I hate headphones. Others prefer them=
. Some use pc speakers. Results vary based on the individual. What I hear y=
ou may not then again you just might hear it exactly the same. I dont worry=
 about that. Just keep exploring with an open mind.

I think it =
varies depending on who you ask as well as what they have personally experi=
enced. As an example, some people believe in angels and demons others do no=
t. Therefor some may get messages that correspond to their own beliefs as w=
ell as the beliefs of those who are speaking.

Almost every person who does=
 this eventually develops a theory that may change over time based on what =
they experience and what their beliefs are. Then there are those who remain=
 undecided or have doubts.

As for me I look at it as purely educational, a=
 learning experience. Ive met many people I never knew existed. Ive researc=
hed topics I'd never even considered. Ive gotten messages and images that a=
re awe inspiring and many interesting concepts to ponder and explore.

Ther=
e are many glimpses of truth, as well as momentary proof along the way that=
 lead me to develop my own theory and eventually you will develop your own =
too. This research is fascinating and can be quite mind blowing.

I dont wo=
rry what anyone else thinks. I have no need to prove anything to anyone els=
e. They can do that for themselves. I always say honesty is the best policy=
 and if you are honest with yourself and others the only ones who object ar=
e those who's lies arent tolerated. So just look for the truth yourself and=
 dont let me or anyone else tell you what that is. 

It's a great journey a=
nd your path is your own!
