<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>THANKS FOR YOUR KIND REPLY, AT LEAST YOU HAVE THE GOOD MANNERS NOT TO
 THROW LABELS AT ME.

I HAVE NEVER EXPERIMENTED WITH THE BOX AND WOULD MOST CERTAINLY LIKE
TO ACQUIRE ONE FOR TO HEAR THE VOICES SPEAK TO ME, I PLAN TO RECORD IT
ON MY COMPUTER SO I CAN DOWNLOAD AND SHARE IT.

CAN YOU BE SO KIND TO SEND ME A WORKING BOX ?

MY ADDRESS IS 

NATHAN SHARMAN
P.O. BOX 1022, 
BELLAIRE, TEXAS 77402.

&gt; Nathan,
&gt;  
&gt; I do very extensive and detailed box research and including myself
there 
&gt; are probably three other researchers in this field right now that
have an 
&gt; equal amount of experience, Steve Hultay is one of them.
&gt;  
&gt; I have never received a message , phrase or answer to a question
that would lead me to the 
&gt; theory that aliens control the astral plane. and human spirits are
no more than slaves.
&gt;  
&gt; As a matter of fact I have gotten numerous messages to the contrary.
That spirit world is a beautiful
&gt; and serene place where there is no pain and suffering. I have also
gotten messages pertaining to there
&gt; being a spirit plane that exists on a lower level, between physical
and spiritual. This may be the realm you are referring to.
&gt;  
&gt; I strive every day to advance the research and communication as I
know other researchers do, if there is a method, 
&gt; technique or new technology that we are not utilizing and you have
knowledge of please share it with us.
&gt;  
&gt; Like Steve I would be very interested in hearing your audio files.
&gt; And it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi read books by Robert Monroe.He had the ability to travel out of
the body and go tothe Astral.There are Technologically advanced Aliens
that seem tocontrol the political situation in the Astral planes,and
they do not want Earth humans to develop fullcommunication with human
spirits in the Astral.WE HUMANS ARE BEING EXPLOITED IN THE ASTRAL
PLANES,that is why when communications are going good, all ofa sudden
you no longer hear from the spirit any more,THAT IS BECAUSE THE SPIRIT
WAS FORBIDDEN tocommunicate further.WE NEED TO START DOING SERIOUS
RESEARCH AND NOT GETALL EXCITED TO JUST HEAR VOICES.WE also need to
study the physics involved, this ishigh energy
physics.__________________________________________________Do You
