ive been out on hunts, the best advice i can give is this, shut down everything in your house, the heat/air etc tv's. At night whenits quiet sit in a room and introduce yourself, and if theres anyone here that would like to communicate. Can as them to make a noise or stop a clock, grandfather type work best, have seen one stopped by a grandmother "residing" in her sons house. The work that you will see mostly on this evp group is done at home and not for "ghost hunting" per say, rather making contact with those on the other side that are able to make contact. We have people here that are in constant contact with "groups" on the other side and relatives. Frank receives communications about events people etc as well. This is a rather broad mineded group and very evp smart.
if you need anything else or advice you can always catch me on yahoo messenger too.

 I'm not sure how to advise you. Sometimes you need some kind of background 
 nosie for the spirits to make a voices out of, like running water, a fan, or 
 white noise. I have my own method I use, but I don't have anything I can 
 offer at the moment. Often it takes several attempts before you get results.
