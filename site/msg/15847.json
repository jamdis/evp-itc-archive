One of the best I&#39;ve ever\ngoten though was at the former Manteno State Mental Hospital in Illinois.\n\nI was there with a group of about 8 people and the place was very active\nthat night. The building we were in is shaped like an &quot;H&quot;. We were in one\narm of the H looking across at the other and saw a shadow figure moving\naround. We were just commenting on the figure when a voice came up in my\nrecording saying &quot;It&#39;s Harold Wing.&quot;  It repeated this once and then said\n&quot;It&#39;s Harold.&quot;\n\nNow, none of us heard any of this while we were standing there and none of\nus knew or ever heard of Harold Wing. One of the people there later managed\nto get into the old records for the hospital and found Harold Wing was a\npatient there who died of typhoid fever there in 1938.\n\nZack\n\nOn Fri, Aug 21, 2009 at 4:08 PM, alan.story &lt;alan.story@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am new to the group, I am a practicing Spiritualist but have never done\n&gt; any EVP work.
