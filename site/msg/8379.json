But generally it&#39;s an \ninteresting approach to include the experimenter in the process of \nEVP generation.\n\nStefan\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Stefan, et al.  I just ran a test session by dropping the Speak \nJet Allophones WAV into \n&gt; SoundSoap2.  I pressed play, then used my cursor to sweep back and \nforth through the \n&gt; file.  I was essentially trying to replicate something similar to a \nmanual radio sweep using \n&gt; the tones.  I immediately received two direct, relevant responses \nto my questions, which \n&gt; really surprised me!\n&gt; \n&gt; In the first, I asked, &quot;How does this work?&quot; The reply is, &quot;I have \nto say the people are \n&gt; talking, but I don&#39;t really care.&quot;  LOL - guess I&#39;ve been told.  ;0)\n&gt; \n&gt; In the second, I asked for a name and was told, &quot;It&#39;s Patrick.&quot;  \nThis really surprised me as \n&gt; Patrick (along with David and a female I have never been able to \nidentify) is the name of \n&gt; one of my tech helpers who speaks to me mostly through the MiniBox, \nbut also has come \n&gt; through during radio sweeps. \n&gt; \n&gt; The last message was a comment I don&#39;t quite understand, &quot;I&#39;m in \ncontact with \n&gt; [counterfeits or counterbase.]&quot;  Whatever that means.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I thought I share this discovery about the SoundSoap2/\nallophones combo with \n&gt; the group because it appears to also have potential for receiving \ncommunication, and I \n&gt; figured some of you might want to try it as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret"}
