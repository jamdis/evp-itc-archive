Thanks for posting that info.  i was *just* wishing for that \nagain yesterday, along with video capability from the camera.  The hacked phones have \nhad both of these features for eons but I never had the nerve to start messing around with \nmine in that way.  I knew I was not technically savvy enough to fix it if something went \nwrong!  LOL.  \n\nMargaret\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, black bear hollow &lt;blackbearhollow@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I just found that there is now an Application for iPhone to record  \n&gt; with. FINALLY! It&#39;s called &quot;Recorder&quot;. I just bought it. A mere 99  \n&gt; cents. If you have an iPhone, you can click on the App Store button  \n&gt; (small blue button with a ruler, brush & pencil in the shape of an &quot;A&quot;  \n&gt; with a circle around it) and install it. To purchase it, it&#39;s located  \n&gt; it the &quot;Top 25 - Top Paid&quot; section.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can record for minutes or hours and email recordings too. It was  \n&gt; worth every cent. Can&#39;t wait to play with this in other areas to see  \n&gt; what I get.\n&gt; \n&gt; w\n&gt; ‡•ê\n&gt;"}
