Hey Frank,
  I told my deceased brother  "Go see Frank and get your portrait taken"  , lol.. :)
   
  I don't think you'd even need to go to the cemetary, 'they' pretty much want to communicate with us as bad as we do with them and I would  bet they are just crowding around you...

        Thanks! I know I have been pretty independent with it. I tried to form a group in my area, but the interest wasn't too high. People didn't want to do this, they wanted to go ghost hunting into cemeteries. Fine for some, but I am much more into ITC.

    Oh yeah, Welcome to the group! I think mostly we're independents, and wildcatters of the paranormal world.
