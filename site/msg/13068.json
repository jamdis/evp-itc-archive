For example, one person might assume=\r\n this \n&gt; was from an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; airshow (since, as you said, the event was v=\r\nery fast, and \n&gt; many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saw it), and so only send in E=\r\nVPs that would be relevant \n&gt; to that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation (I.e. Not sending=\r\n in child-like sounds, or \n&gt; sending in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sounds that sound like sc=\r\nratchy tower or inter-plane\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication) . If the crash was a c=\r\nommercial airline, \n&gt; then dozens\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of different people could have =\r\nbeen killed, which means \n&gt; you could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find SOME relevancy no matt=\r\ner what noises are returned to \n&gt; you:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practical any word, name, =\r\nor sound will support some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speculation that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it could have b=\r\neen relevant to one of those people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do think it is a=\r\n good idea to test your theories.

Now&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that everyone knows they are from a plane crash, that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; will set&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; up the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prejudice of hearing plane/travel related words in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; evp noises.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And as you probably know, once that prejudice is active, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; once&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I say&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Doesn&#39;t that sound like someone\n saying&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sssssstewardesssss ...&quot;, then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone hears THAT word, rather than just noise, or, for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; example&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Stewed ass&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And, if something does sound like a plane/travel related &lt;BR&gt;&gt; word, it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will now be highlighted as an example of why this was a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; successful&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test, and the other less-relevant words ignored. This is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a form of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confirmation bias, which again, hurts the value of the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; test.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A more objective way would have been to send out both &lt;BR&gt;&gt; crash&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; related&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; items, and completely innocuous items, with no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; explanation of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; where&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each was from, and see what\n kind of EVPs were returned on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; each.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Further, the returned EVPs should then be returned to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; someone to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evaluate who ALSO doesn&#39;t know the origin of the objects, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; so that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they do not torture the interpretations into the forms you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; hope and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expect them to be (again, plane/travel related). While &lt;BR&gt;&gt; this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; test of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course lacks all kinds of controls, this would at least &lt;BR&gt;&gt; be a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; start to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defining a double-blind test, which is the gold standard &lt;BR&gt;&gt; for good&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; research in this kind of research.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even though you have tried to keep some of the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; information quiet,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is still quite a large\n opportunity for guessing and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coincidence. For example, one person might assume this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was from an&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; airshow (since, as you said, the event was very fast, and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; many&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; people&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saw it), and so only send in EVPs that would be relevant &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation (I.e. Not sending in child-like sounds, or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sending in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sounds that sound like scratchy tower or inter-plane&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication) . If the crash was a commercial airline, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; then dozens&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of different people could have been killed, which means &lt;BR&gt;&gt; you could&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find SOME relevancy no matter what noises are returned to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; you:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practical any word, name, or sound will support some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; speculation\n that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it could have been relevant to one of those people.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do think it is a good idea to test your theories. But &lt;BR&gt;&gt; my purpose&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here is to suggest ways to help these tests be as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; objective as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible, and for your efforts and testing to be as worth &lt;BR&gt;&gt; while as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible, and for the youtube video results you make to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; be as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; valuable and bulletproof as possible. But I am concerned &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; above scenario is full of opportunity for subjectivity and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misinterpretation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-771033619-1229123956=:33461--"}
