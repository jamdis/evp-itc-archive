Frank,
 
The files i heard clearly was the "Frank, i'm talking"and "Thank you,  
princess".  The other i heard "He's" and "The Voltage", but didn't  catch the 
"Checking" part.  All in all, sounds like a "Frank's Box" to  me.  Although boxes 
automate the raw material, i'm finding that other  methods prove success as 
well.  Even traditional EVP with my Panasonic  rr-dr60 is proving to be a positive 
attribute.  I think once they get in  touch with your life signature or aura 
or whatever they see in us, you can use  any method and get great results.  I 
have used every box and method known  and have had success with every one, i 
keep all my files backed up from this  journey for future reference.  My 
problem is that i don't stay on one style  of EVP, i keep jumping around to try new 
things.  I also have another small  project in the works, an idea i passed by 
Stefan the other day.  I bought  an old pocket pc off Ebay that i didn't get 
yet.  It is a bit older and has  a windows CE based program installed on it, 
Stefan seems to believe that  EvpMaker might work on that kind of palm pilot 
because it is a C+++ designed  program.  Well, in a couple days i will let you 
guys know if it  works.  If it does, it could be a handheld unit to bring out on 
location  and it has already proved to work great for me and some other 
researchers  on here.
