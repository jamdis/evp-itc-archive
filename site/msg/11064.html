    <div>Thanks Charm. I have been using Gold Wave. ACtually I am
learning it as I go. I have heard the raw evps' that some people have
caught. Then I hear them after they cleaned them up. Allot of
background noise has been removed. I thought if anyone could tell me
how to remove the noise of the fan, I may get something.<br>

I will check your link out and appreciate the help you offered.<br>
