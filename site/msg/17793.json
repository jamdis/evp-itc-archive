I also change the\ntiming cap to 100uf, and use a 100K linear pot for frequency, in series with\na 10k resistor instead of the 560 ohm.  The 10k resisitor is to try to\nprevent the motorboating sound when the sweep is too fast. Instead of\nproviding the trianlge out, I used the last op amp for level setting, adding\nthe DC offset, which goes to the + input, instead of the usual inverting\ninput.\n\n F-S\n\nCan' eally ell by he me e , looks almos he same as he iangle sweep. excep i seems o slow sligh ly a he peaks.
