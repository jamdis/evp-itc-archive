 I think those are Misty's pix. I did some experiments using a "box" to scan a TV/VCR tuner, and got some interesting, but unverifiable images, such as the MIB guy on the group home page. It would be interesting if someone could figure out how make one of the little RS portable TV's scan.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] ITC Photos--Question

      Hi Frank & All group members,

I'm new to the group and have been into the paranormal investigations 
field for about 10 years now. I am anxious to start ITC-EVP 
experimentation. I was looking over the photos section. Can someone 
explain to me what they represent and how and when the photos are 
taken. What is the procedure?

Thanks much to all!
Rita
