<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Within the last week I came across the concept of the ghost box 
(Frank&#x27;s box) and have had immediate results.

This is actually using a mobile phone on radio mode with a manual scan, 
simply holding down the button and it scans through the FM bands either 
up or down. There was no white noise being played at the same time nor 
on review.

What surprised me was the clarity of the answers to direct questions 
which could then be checked on a reviewing the tape. But also that on 
one ocassion the replies weren&#x27;t audible until the replay of the taped 
session was heard.

Is this typical?

I can upload the sessions which are quite interesting due to the 
subject being discussed.</pre>
