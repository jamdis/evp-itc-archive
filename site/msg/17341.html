Same here - I have said=C2=A0 (several=C2=A0 times before) that since I hav=
e no results I consider can only be explained paranormally, I have not post=
ed them.=C2=A0 As soon as I=C2=A0 get those, I will post them.=C2=A0 But I =
don't see the point of me just posting stuff to say 'me too!', or to follow=
 the crowd, or to try to fit in.=C2=A0 I am not disparaging those who have =
those results, and do post them.=C2=A0 And since this is a discussion,group=
, it seems we should be able to discuss them, and question, and make sugges=
tions.

Civilly.

Also, Misty, there is more to 'research' than everybody d=
oing and saying the same thing.=C2=A0 Even in what might seem a well-scoped=
 area of study, people can be at different levels of knowledge, or interest=
, or focus.=C2=A0 Some people here are interested mostly in the hardware.=
=C2=A0 Some have no interest or talent there, and focus on using the techno=
logy.=C2=A0 Some stand back some, looking at process, controls, quality ass=
urance.=C2=A0 Some may just be interested in the psychic or paranormal comp=
onents.=C2=A0 Some may be more interested in the "Is there anything there" =
question.=C2=A0 Some, "I know something's there, but what is it?".=C2=A0 So=
me "I know there are ghosts there, what do they want?".=C2=A0 Some, "I know=
 what they want, how can I help?".=C2=A0 And so on.

One person giving thei=
r perspective, in a different focus, or a different opinion, is not, "crap"=
, or "wasting time".=C2=A0=C2=A0 It should be seen as healthy, helping a sc=
ience stretch and check, redirect or confirm,=C2=A0 grow and explore.=C2=A0=
 To swat that down is a source of the negativity.=C2=A0 And if you are conc=
erned about negative comments, go back and read the threads, and see who is=
 actually making the insults.

But, to make what I consider a positive sugg=
estion, I would suggest people stop insulting others with different opinion=
s, and allow civil discussion, and consider that none of us knows it all, a=
nd can still learn things from others.=C2=A0 In fact, I hope that is the re=
al purpose of the group.
