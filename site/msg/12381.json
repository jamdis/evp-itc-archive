The\nfile I posted was compressed for space saving, but from my initial\nquestion I shaved several seconds off between the &#39;yes my actual name&#39;\nand the &#39;andy...mike&#39;. total clip time before compression was about 10\nseconds. Still pretty new at this, so hearing my first and middle name\nrepeated back to me takes some getting used to, but very exciting. \n\nThanks,\nAndy"}
