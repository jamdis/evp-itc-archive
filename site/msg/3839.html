Nothings stopping us that are activily involved investigating haunted 
locations. Where EVP has to an extent proven a haunting, going back 
to the location to use a Box is worth a college try. I can hardly 
wait... 

If it does work, helping earth bound spirits to discuss their 
predicament, and eventually crossover, would be a win win win 
situation!

&gt; &gt; After doing box research for a while now and having the 
opportunity  
&gt; &gt; to work with several different
&gt; &gt; types of boxes. I would have to agree the boxes are meant for 
and  
&gt; &gt; work better as a stationary communication device
&gt; &gt; sort of like a communication station that is consistently under 
the  
&gt; &gt; same basic conditions. I have never taken my boxes out of my home
&gt; &gt; or done a session out side of my home and I don&#x27;t believe that  
&gt; &gt; taking the box , any box not just yours to a remote allegedly  
&gt; &gt; haunted location
&gt; &gt; will not serve to enhance communication. And if anyone is really  
&gt; &gt; concerned about summoning dark entities they have a much better 
chance
&gt; &gt; of that communicating with a grounded and maybe disgruntled or  
&gt; &gt; confused entity at a haunted location.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; so I agree with your assessment of box use 100%

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This &#x27;negativity&#x27; is bad enough, I wouldn&#x27;t even want it on the  
&gt; &gt; group except Moon is the one that says everyone else,  me and 
the  
&gt; &gt; group included, gets only &#x27;false communcation&#x27; or &#x27;bad guys&#x27;, 
and  
&gt; &gt; that&#x27;s from his own friggin&#x27; blog, I didn&#x27;t make that up, or 
pull  
&gt; &gt; it out of my butt. So it effects us all, and I think is open for  
&gt; &gt; discussion/comment knowing this will get forwarded back to him. 
In  
&gt; &gt; fact I&#x27;ll cc Moon this posting.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  When he says all these scan radio users, that means me to, since 
I  
&gt; &gt; use the things, and I prefer the linear scan mode. What I say 
about  
&gt; &gt; the box use is completely disregarded, and what I get through 
the  
&gt; &gt; box, myself, as The Box Maker, is minimalized by Moon. Moon puts 
my  
&gt; &gt; name out there connected with his so called &#x27;telephone to the  
&gt; &gt; dead&#x27;, and I very much disapprove of my name being applied to an  
&gt; &gt; unauthorized use of my equipment. I don&#x27;t give a crap what he 
gets  
&gt; &gt; through the boxes, or does with it, but don&#x27;t make it look like 
I  
&gt; &gt; designed it specificaly as the &#x27;telephone to the dead&#x27;, I 
designed  
&gt; &gt; it as a friggin&#x27; ITC device, that is capable of two way  
&gt; &gt; communication--SOMETIMES, it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a guarenteed  
&gt; &gt; connection, and you can&#x27;t just dial up anyone, anytime, that&#x27;s 
an  
&gt; &gt; exageration! The &quot;box&quot; was intended by me to be used in a fixed  
&gt; &gt; location, just by taking it to a GHU, or an &quot;investiigation&quot; is  
&gt; &gt; using it in a way I did not intend, and I still say it&#x27;s better 
if  
&gt; &gt; used in one place. All guide lines I have offered for box use 
are  
&gt; &gt; completely ignored, not just by Moon, to be fair.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  It has been shown that many different approaches work for this  
&gt; &gt; communcation, I suggest Moon design and build his own &#x27;telephone  
&gt; &gt; the dead&#x27; and leave my name out of it.
