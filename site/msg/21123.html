&gt; btw Steve did you tell all the people about the time you got old King Hezekiah when you did a ghost box meeting one time?  For those that don&#x27;t know, King Hezekiah is in the Bible, and he came to Steve, and  I still have that file, sf

&gt;  &gt; Well, Tech David said something very nice this morning, &quot;Father God has the 
&gt;  &gt;  whole Earth in His Hands, and He&#x27;s holding on to the Earth plane&quot; reminded 
&gt;  &gt; me of  that old time song, &quot;He&#x27;s got the whole world in His Hands&quot; so, 
&gt;  &gt; thought I&#x27;d  share this new, and very old information with everyone.  sf
