&gt; I&#x27;ll take that as a challange, Bruce!After proper burn in time, to 
attune the Box to me, I will go forth.I plan to take it to several 
places that I know spirits dwell. We shall see through experimental

several different&gt; types of boxes. I would have to agree the boxes 
are meant for and work better as a stationary communication device &gt; 
sort of like a communication station that is consistently under the 
same basic conditions. I have never taken my boxes out of my home&gt; or 
done a session out side of my home and I don&#x27;t believe that taking 
the box , any box not just yours to a remote allegedly haunted 
location&gt; will not serve to enhance communication. And if anyone is 
really concerned about summoning dark entities they have a much 
better chance&gt; of that communicating with a grounded and maybe 
disgruntled or confused entity at a haunted location.&gt; &gt; so I agree 
with your assessment of box use 100%&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday

This &#x27;negativity&#x27; is bad enough, I wouldn&#x27;t even want it on the group 
except Moon is the one that says everyone else, me and the group 
included, gets only &#x27;false communcation&#x27; or &#x27;bad guys&#x27;, and that&#x27;s 
from his own friggin&#x27; blog, I didn&#x27;t make that up, or pull it out of 
my butt. So it effects us all, and I think is open for 
discussion/comment knowing this will get forwarded back to him. In 
fact I&#x27;ll cc Moon this posting. When he says all these scan radio 
users, that means me to, since I use the things, and I prefer the 
linear scan mode. What I say about the box use is completely 
disregarded, and what I get through the box, myself, as The Box 
Maker, is minimalized by Moon. Moon puts my name out there connected 
with his so called &#x27;telephone to the dead&#x27;, and I very much 
disapprove of my name being applied to an unauthorized use of my 
equipment. I don&#x27;t give a crap what he gets through the boxes, or 
does with it, but don&#x27;t make it look like I designed it specificaly 
as the &#x27;telephone to the dead&#x27;, I designed it as a friggin&#x27; ITC 
device, that is capable of two way communication--SOMETIMES, it&#x27;s not 
like it&#x27;s a guarenteed connection, and you can&#x27;t just dial up anyone, 
anytime, that&#x27;s an exageration! The &quot;box&quot; was intended by me to be 
used in a fixed location, just by taking it to a GHU, or 
an &quot;investiigation&quot; is using it in a way I did not intend, and I 
still say it&#x27;s better if used in one place. All guide lines I have 
offered for box use are completely ignored, not just by Moon, to be 
fair. It has been shown that many different approaches work for this 
communcation, I suggest Moon design and build his own &#x27;telephone the 
dead&#x27; and leave my name out of it. Frank-S&gt; &gt; &gt; Connect and share in
