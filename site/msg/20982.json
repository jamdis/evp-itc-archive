My question was , What must be conected to pins 4 and 11 ? What voltage ? ... I didnt know if , for example , pin 11 must be conected to 0v (ground level), or to\n&gt;  -12v , That was the question .

How is the conection ? ... 11 to -12v or 0 . 4 to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; +12 ? .... I tried , and conecting 11 to 0 v , i got a triangular wave ,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; but , i couldnt get a apropiate dc level , the minimum level i got was\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; almost 14v , when i tried more low dc level , the wave lose the form , and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the offset pot didnt go ok , it didnt have any effect in triangular wave .\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
