Rhonda, what Mike said is absolutely right. It's all for entertainment purposes. No ratings means no more show. Normal investigations can be fairly boring and the majority of the time yield no results.

On an investigation, once the equipment is set up and we are ready to begin, we like to sit quietly and take in the atmosphere, get a "feel" for the location. 

When doing EVP work, we will ask questions, giving ample time for a response from our spirit friends. If we ask for a response in the form of a "knock" or other similar noises and get one, we will thank them and seek out where it occurred and try to communicate some more. 

Jeremy

Hi Rhonda,

My opinion follows:
What you are seeing is for entertainment purposes.  The production 
companies know that they can not capture and keep an audience with 
slow or no action, and a theme that drags on.
They need that high energy spark to keep the viewers coming back, 
especially viewers who are not able to get out and do investigations 
as much as they'd like or for those that have never done an 
investgation, but like ghost hunting stuff.

Their show ratings depend on viewer numbers which equate to 
advertising dollars.  That is the bottom line for any show and 
entertainment venue on TV or radio.

So... what you are seeing with all that over-drama stuff is for 
entertainment and shouldn't be taken as serious investigation.

That's how I see it at least, and that's why I don't usually watch 
those type shows, although I will check them out once-in-awhile to 
see if they are using any type of new tool or paranormal device.

Shows like "Haunting Evidence' that don't have screamng, running, and 
constant yapping when none should be happening, don't last.
'Haunting Evidence' was just dropped from the TruTV lineup. They 
tried to be a more serious documentary type show, whether they really 
were or not? But it didn't work for the rating numbers.

I think you'll be seeing more and more of the 'entertainment' type 
investigation shows being put on a number of different networks, 
because that's what's selling right now.

Rhonda, the type of good manners investigation you are describing 
does happen I'm guessing in many groups around the world, when a 
production company is not involved.  Get that production company 
involved... and the entertainment factor takes over.

(wish I knew people in arizona I could go on an investigation with)  
I know when I do my research here with my radio shack hack I always 
say thanks and am polite and have never freaked out or cussed in 
response to one of the responses Ive gotten.  Anyways just curious.  
Hope everyone has a
