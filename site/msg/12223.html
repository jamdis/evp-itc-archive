<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi again Mike E.

I record alot of water sessions so by speaking during these sessions I often drown out or destroy whats being said. I am also careful not to record on full mic volume (I use half volume on the mic at all times) because the water noise will drown out the underlying voices even tho its 15+ feet away from the mic.

Franks right theres little need to speak but it does make it seem more &quot;real&quot; or proof positive to some people to get the direct reply to thier own voice. If you feel it interferes with your sessions when you speak there are ways around it. Try asking the question in your head or make a list using wordpad of your questions to save with the files if you dont want to forget what ya asked. Just do what you feel comfortable with.

Misty

&gt; Hi Misty been a long time since we spoke.
&gt;  
&gt; I remember back early this year when I first met Frank, and
&gt; he too made the same comment as you, that you need not say
&gt; anything.
&gt;  
&gt; I on the other hand could not accept this concept, but now
&gt; after many of my crime case recordings, and reviewing all my
&gt; questions asked, the voices told me what I needed to hear to
&gt; get the right leads. As soon as I turn that radio on ,they
&gt; start talking about what happened, and even when i am asking
&gt; them a question they are still talking. I have had to learn
&gt; how to block out my questioning to hear what they said when
&gt; I was talking. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I did try a recording without asking a question once, but
&gt; just could not do it again as I have this in my head you
&gt; need to ask questions.
&gt;  
&gt; Its hard to let go of, but you are right, they know what
&gt; you need to hear.
&gt;  
&gt; Mike
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They have made mentions of it over the years including a
&gt; recent statement pertaining to the contact world which I
&gt; just posted over on my esnips from last session. They said
&gt; when the contact world first began it was very hard, and
&gt; that access was terrible. Perhaps it is easier with some of
&gt; the newer methods researchers are using to maintain contact.
&gt; Franks box has opened up a new avenue for those who had a
&gt; hard time hearing the traditional forms of evp. 
&gt; 
&gt; When I ask what the best method for contact is they always
&gt; maintain its the method that no words are necessary. Or as
&gt; one stated recently (also posted on esnips in water files)
&gt; &quot;I can telepathic, you just can&#x27;t hear good
&gt; telepathic&quot; &quot;it will always be tenuous&quot;. This
&gt; coming after a few restless nights of being woken up to loud
&gt; voices speaking to me or saying my name. Also a few things
&gt; going on when I was wide awake and fully alert. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have also had some info come thru on &quot;stations&quot;
&gt; and even one recording where voices I know seemed to jump
&gt; from one group to another as I switched methods they could
&gt; be heard introducing themselves to those surrounding them
&gt; stating why they were barging in there to communicate. I
&gt; find it all of interest tho it tends to be alot to wrap ones
&gt; mind around.

&gt; &gt; for Misty   Not a surprise here about ETs being
&gt; &gt; involved.  From day one I have been sort of tracking
&gt; what
&gt; &gt; is reportedly said about &quot;who is involved and who
&gt; is in
&gt; &gt; charge&quot; of communications on the others side.  I
&gt; hope
&gt; &gt; more researchers ask the question so we can all
&gt; compare
&gt; &gt; notes.   For example, one evper report there are
&gt; 10,000
&gt; &gt; &quot;communications stations&quot; staffed on the
&gt; other
&gt; &gt; side.  My question are; staffed by who or what, what
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; their purpose, do they have regulations for what can
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; said to this side, and many, many more questions. 
&gt; Like it
&gt; &gt; has been said, if we knew all the answers this would
&gt; not be
&gt; &gt; research.  Hope to hear more on this from you and
&gt; others. 
&gt; &gt; Thanks for that....ron

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks K yes most of it is very clear for me. I will
&gt; try
&gt; &gt; and get the rest of the files up in the next few days
&gt; or so.
&gt; &gt; My schedules a little crazy with work and life but I
&gt; will
&gt; &gt; get a couple days off later in the week to post more.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Misty! I listened to the sweep files on your
&gt; ESnips
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; they were
&gt; &gt; &gt; incredible. Very clear and easily understandable
&gt; - at
&gt; &gt; &gt; least to me! Very
&gt; &gt; &gt; cool validation for Andy. Congrats!
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; K

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello everyone. I posted a few files from my
&gt; recent
&gt; &gt; sweep
&gt; &gt; &gt; tuning 
&gt; &gt; &gt; session. I will try and post more from it later
&gt; when I
&gt; &gt; get
&gt; &gt; &gt; time. There 
&gt; &gt; &gt; was one very lengthy message that seemed to be a
&gt; &gt; higher
&gt; &gt; &gt; level &#x27;poetic&#x27; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; type voice. Also some messages involving a new
&gt; member
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; our group. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#x27;s up to him if he wants to share his
&gt; &gt; experiences.
&gt; &gt; &gt; However I did post 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the one file with his name because it has some
&gt; &gt; significant
&gt; &gt; &gt; meaning to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; me that I explained on the file post there. It
&gt; &gt; reminded me
&gt; &gt; &gt; of something 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank Sumption sent me years ago when I was a
&gt; newbie
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; had the same 
&gt; &gt; &gt; effect on me that it had on the new member.
