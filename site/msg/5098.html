I figured that factors differ each time a do a session.   I know I probably will never be able to pin point key elements in this whole line of so called communication, but its worth a try.  I'm looking at how many channels are being scanned during the course of the day (morning, noon and night) for my own curiosity.  I have included weather as well as my mood (happy, sad, stressed, etc.) also to see if the mental state may play a part with all of this.
