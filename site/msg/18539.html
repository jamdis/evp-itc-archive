<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am very glad for your atention Frank , i will make a box and i need it be very good , for best results . So , your answer says to me the diferents results take origin by materials , not much the dimensions , isnt it? . Another important question , what is the range of frecuencies of the triangle wave ? I know about the model of radio determine that , but what is the common range ? ... hz? , khz? ...

&gt;  Aluminum seems to work the best. I got a voice that sounded like Raudive
&gt; saying copper. I have used plastic and wood. Different materials seem to
&gt; allow different levels, but it&#x27;s hard to tell for sure who/what is talking.
&gt; 
&gt;  Folding the tube seems to make it act like a larger tube. With just a long
&gt; straight tube the sound tends to be tinny. I made a chamber 12 inches square
&gt; and 4 feet long from MDF board lined with aluminum foil years ago, the
&gt; voices were almost demonic sounding, so I took it apart.
&gt; 
&gt;  The only difference with the hacked radio is the sweep. With the hack radio
&gt; the sweep steps so the radio is tuned in 10khz increments. With the box it&#x27;s
&gt; a continuous sweep, linear uses a triangle wave.

&gt; &gt; Ok Frank , thanks for your answer , but , what material you recommend for
&gt; &gt; the best results? , what is the diferent whith the long of tubes in results
&gt; &gt; ? and could you say a hacked radio produce the iddentical results like a box
&gt; &gt; built ? (considering echo in box)

&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#x27;s just a chamber, an enclosure, anything can be used depending on how
&gt; &gt; &gt; much room you have. The effect is like a mechanical sound filter. The
&gt; &gt; larger
&gt; &gt; &gt; the siaze the lower tyhe effected frequencies. I use tubing so it can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; made smaller to fit inside a cabinet. I don&#x27;t even measure anything when
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; make an echo chamber, it&#x27;s just made to fit whatever cabinet I&#x27;m using.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The boxes work without the chamber, but the chamber seems to add
&gt; &gt; something,
&gt; &gt; &gt; maybe a space where the sound can be more easily manipulated.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I need to know about the echo chamber ... dimensions, materials ,
&gt; &gt; anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knows it?
