  Mr. Frank Sumption ( most intelligent person in the paranormal field )
  =
I would like to know what your honest opinion of the Ghost Box Hacker
is? o=
r ( Mike's box)
  Can the radio at Radio Shack really do that?
  Because it=
 us definately a cheap device.
  You have opened up the door to new possibi=
lities for understanding the
paranormal,
  and as a person who is searching=
, I hope that you know how much we all
really
   respect and admire you.
  =
 Thankyou for all you have done, and are doing for the future of this
field=
 of study.
