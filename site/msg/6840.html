I'm on a forum with the mother of one of the kids.  She says that it is 
real, but there are some issues on the production end.  Basically any 
attempts at the technical side of investigation gets cut.  The kids 
aren't used to being on camera, so you do see a lot of retakes that seem 
rehearsed.  She was also not thrilled that they chose to emphasize so 
much demonic stuff right off the bat.  That was way out of balance.

No, I was also howling over that.  So talking to dead people is bad, 
eh?  Maybe I should take their word for it that all dead people are 
nasty, negative entities, as well.  This kind of thing drives me nuts.  
Repeat after me, A&E: Ghosts are people, too!
