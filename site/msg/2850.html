<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This group has turned into a first grade class when the teacher leaves 
the room !

It&#x27;s supposed to be about a free exchange of idea&#x27;s concerning evp-itc
not a mud slinging forum or a research bashing arena.

Frank, myself and Steve are continuously posting files and asking for 
feedback and for the last three months I have gotten maybe one or two 
responses to my posts and files and I don&#x27;t think Steve has gotten any.
also it seems like the only reason everyone jumps to reply to a post 
that frank makes is because he is the man with the boxes, I know there 
will be a 100 posts now saying &quot;OH THATS NOT TRUE AT ALL&quot; but be truth 
full with yourselves and you will find that it is.

I myself are guilty of that to a certain extent and I have a Frank&#x27;s 
box already. lets all stop the bull and play nice. Let&#x27;s try to further 
the research and work together with positive feedback or CONSTRUCTIVE 
criticism, CONSTRUCTIVE being the key word.
