<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Great !!!  Thanks Everyone.
this is all new to us still,  my daughter &amp; I watch ghost hunters (for years 
now)
but many times I cannot make out the evps they play on the show.
so we were surprised when ours were clear enough for us to understand most 
of them.
I will make a folder for evps and one for pics, as we get orbs around my 
cats alot.

would like to hear from others,  need help undertsanding evp&#x27;s, the spirits 
in my house,
and what to do next, how to deal with them etc.
I have lived here 11 yrs and many many things go on around us, voices, orbs, 
loud noises,
things moving in front of us, etc.
its an active house.
we had an investigation, but seems I captured more than expected.

looking forward to hearing from others and learning about this.

I have been on the group, just quietly reading and learning,
now I&#x27;ve done my own, and am amazed..but need to learn more and to 
understand.

Thanks
Lyn
