Suzy feel free to share your evp's with the group thats what its here for. Some people post things in the file section tho the yahoo groups are limited on file space so most of us just attach them to our posts or emails so those who have it set for individual email in preferences can listen to them. Those who do not want to recieve file attachments use other settings. 
   
  Also for those of you who want to share alot of files with people you can get a free ESNIPS http://www.enips.com account which will allow you to share your recordings, images, or whatever you want to upload. Its easy to signup and they give you 50 gigs of space which is alot. It allows you to share with the public or privately it's up to you.
   
  Attaching an evp from my last session to this post (you need individual email settings to get it in your inbox).
