Sending all 1.5 million of them to him now hehehe. Just \nkiddin. I wouldnt know where to start/end. \n\nI did get one evp last night I am excited about tho. Was a nice gift. A \nrepeat of my very first evp from my mother, saying exactly what she \nsaid how she said it all those years ago. A bit off on her soft tone \nvoice but the message was the same. It is loud and clear and was using \nST method which she doesnt like to use usually.\n\nI was always a bit disheartened that I didnt know what I was doing when \nI got that first message and screwed up on saving it before my pc \ncrashed. I didnt think it would ever be recovered completely to how I \nheard it that night. But for this one I saved it right, no pc crashin \ngoin on, and now I am left with a nice repeat today to hold onto.\n\nI may post that to the files area in a bit. \n\nMisty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;misujoey&quot; &lt;Debbie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The Maury Show is asking for Evp&#39;s and Spirit Video and Photos ..\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeffrey Wands, Chris, and I did a quick &quot;How to&quot; segment for \n&gt; people &quot;new&quot; to the Paranormal World ...\n&gt; \n&gt; www.1800heaven.com/aboutme.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Debbie\n&gt;"}
