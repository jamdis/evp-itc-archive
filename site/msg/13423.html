oor To The Dead


                      I have to admit that I thought I ha=
d seen the worst 'paranormal' show on television already. I was wrong. Door=
 to the Dead has exceeded my worst expectations.

                      Gen=
erally, I respect John Oliver's work as a medium. While I have no personal =
experience with him, in the past he has looked and acted more genuine than =
not, the rolling of the eyes put aside for the moment.

                   =
   I do take exception to the characterization of the talking box as an Edi=
son device. I have documented the history of Edison, ITC and EVP  elsewhere=
. This is however the smallest concern I have with this show.

            =
          Prior to wathcing I had just had a conversation with a respected =
colleague on the West coast regarding interesting phenomena he and others a=
re constantly observing in sites with phenomena similar to that on Door to =
the Dead. None of those measurements were made by this team. The use of the=
rmal in this situation is not indicated as well.

                      The=
 real concern is that no attempt was made to help this family in a broader =
context. The skeptic did and said nothing skeptical as far as I could tell.=
 Key questions were not asked (at least on-camera) that would reveal the ps=
ycho-dynamics of this family. We know fairly well at this time that PK phen=
omena is often centered on a focal person who can exhibit specific characte=
ristics. That the team seems unaware of this is quite disturbing to a perso=
n like myself.

                      A real research opportunity was lost =
in this case, as was an opportunity to educate the public on the right way =
to approach such situations. Continually sending the messages that phenomen=
a is based on 'demons' and 'spirits' exclusively does nothing to further th=
e position of serious investigators, which is perhaps most troubling of all=
.
