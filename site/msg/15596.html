<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well in the beginning when everyone was thinking hurricane we had our eyes turned to the afrcian coast, this doesn&#x27;t seem to the case anymore. 

There seems to be something to this though as several of us have gotten something similar about either august or the 15th.

I know you don&#x27;t actively participate in the communication Frank but could you ask for more information on the type of event perhaps?

When I inquired I just got a &quot;let it go&quot; piece.
