I have posted a direct recording in my file under RS12-469 Direct Recording.  This may be a good opportunity to get help with my technical challange here in Mexico.  I have posted what I recorded from AM signals along the beach here on the Gulf with the recorder patched directly into the RS 12 469.  Most channels are Spanish language although one or two channels skip across the Gulf fromTexas.  So you shouldn't hear many English words from the radio if any.
   
  I am submitting this because, with the help of this group, I recently learned that I have been missing all the messages on my recordings.  That is...I couldn't hear anything where others with experience hear plenty.
   
  My previous post was with EVP maker.  If somethng could be heard on the RS recording patched directly into my recorder that would be another amazing event for me.  I of course hear nothing from the other side.  Ron L
