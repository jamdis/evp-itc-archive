Nope not sure, the news just said she collapsed and was pronounced dead. Some say drug overdose but they wont say much til the autopsy.

  I tried to post these to update my website this morning but my ftp was down and didnt have time to email before work so I am going to go ahead and post this one since it would have gotten posted before it bugged me.
   
  The Anna Nicole Smith death happened and was all over tv today. I got this name at about 2 am this morning/last night. I dont know a Nicole. I do know an Anna and some Smiths but I didnt get those names just this (attached to this email is the sound files)
   
  And the other remark which of course now makes some sense since her son just died in a likewise manner not long ago.
   
  Chip is a name I do recognize. I had a Chip Peters show up when I first started recording. Anyway perhaps you can hear it or maybe you cant. I was experimenting with a revised technique and had some pretty impressive results. I will post more later from that session. Theres alot of them to share and I was hoping the website would resolve its problem by now...but they are still down ftp wise.
