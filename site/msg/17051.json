The ritual lets the person release this energy in a constructive\nmanner. After a while though, it builds back up.\n\nAlso, people have reported seeing glimpses of apparitions even in\npoltergeist cases. So it is something for you to consider. That Jay sees the\napparition could mean that the energy is coming from him.\n\nThe good news is that if it is PK energy, it should go away eventually.\nSince it seems to relax after ritual, you may try some experiments with\nthat. Have Jay do some personal ritual work and see if the phenomena\nsubsides. If it doesn&#39;t subside, then do some personal ritual yourself and\nsee what happens. Just see if you can effect or find some patten to it. If\nyou are able to establish that it does consistently respond to ritual work\nby either of you, then that may be your answer. You just need to do some\nkind of regular ritual work to release the energy constructively.\n\nEven if it is an actual entity, since ritual does seem to affect it, this\nmay still be your answer-maybe you can make a ritual around communicating\nwith it.\n\nIf it is an actual being, unfortunately there just is no sure fire method to\nmake them leave. I am sure you have run into this before in your work as a\nmedium - you can ask them to leave, but it&#39;s just like asking a living\nperson to leave. If they don&#39;t want to go, they won&#39;t.\n\nMy suggestion in this case would be to keep trying to communicate with it.\nEventually hopefully you will get through to it.\n\n\nOn Fri, Apr 23, 2010 at 4:56 PM, AzureDamselfly &lt;azuredamselfly@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you , April.

I have not written much but have visaully followed this\n&gt;&gt; group over the past year. I have much experience in the realm of the\n&gt;&gt; paranormal.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Here is the issue. Our home has an inhabitant that we cannot seem to\n&gt;&gt; remove. It does not speak to us on the frank&#39;s box nor will it communicate\n&gt;&gt; through either me or my partner, Jay. We are both mediums. It slams and\n&gt;&gt; bangs in the house almost ceaselessly at night. It hits the walls, windows,\n&gt;&gt; the tv, the bedside tables and the doors. I am at a loss as to how to\n&gt;&gt; otherwise communicate because as I said with the 2 boxes we have, it won&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; speak.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I am open to any and all suggestions. We have told it to go, tried many\n&gt;&gt; different suggested rituals and to no avail. It will go quiet for a day to\n&gt;&gt; three days after ritual work but begins again, only louder.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Please, if anyone can help or direct us to someone who can I would be most\n&gt;&gt; grateful.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt;&gt; Annie & Jay C.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nYou welcome :)Pol e geis phenomena could also explain why i ge s quie e a e i ual, especially i he pe son om which he ene gy is s emming is in ol ed in he i ual.
