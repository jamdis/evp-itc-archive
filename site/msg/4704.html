<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>We actually don&#x27;t know who we&#x27;re communicating with using the boxes. I 
suspect it isn&#x27;t what we traditionally call a &quot;ghost&quot;.

I also suspect that people are not hearing their loved ones.  The loved 
oneshave probably been elsewhere for some time ...

&gt; I personally have seen Chris use his box in public forum four times.
&gt; I have heard the box give audible yes and no type answers to peoples
&gt; questions.  I do feel though that the ones that get emotionally moved
&gt; the most are the ones wanting with all their heart to hear from a
&gt; loved one.  When these people get an answer that may or may not be
&gt; heard by all, they feel that it is indeed from a loved one and it
&gt; hits them in the heart as if it was real.  I would love to hear a
&gt; recorded session from start to finish as an investigator.  After all
&gt; this research is for all not just &quot;30&quot;....  :-)
