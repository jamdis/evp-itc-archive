<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>&quot;This is a good point. It&#x27;s like a mirage. Just because the (visual)
information looks good, and is actually wrong, there is still something giving the information.&quot;

 What I meant was I&#x27;m guilty of reading between the lines, and seeing/reading stuff not really there.

&gt; This is a good point.  It&#x27;s like a mirage.  Just because the (visual) information looks good, and is actually wrong, there is still something giving the information. In this case, it&#x27;s just the interaction of the heat and light interacting in non-paranormal ways and creating something we misinterpret as real.  Just because we perceive it doesn&#x27;t mean it is really there, and people have risked their health chasing after it too long.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Too funny, Zack!  Maybe that&#x27;s why several locations at the PEAR project map (showing RNG measurement devices) are flaring like fireworks today!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know what the heck is going on. Several Yahoogroups I&#x27;m on have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exploded into arguments lately. A rift in the Force? Humidity too high?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pollen allergies?
