Does one need special permission to get in there?   You folks should go 
back, and release them since a few of them already know you  Steve, this is 
Steve?  Right?  sf

Unfortunately I did not get to attempt to cross them. After my  
demonstration, another group that was also there started complaining that the  box made 
too much noise and was hendering their investigation so I turned it  off. I 
wouldn't want my direct communication with the deceased inmates to  mess up 
their EVP work, now would I? I apoligized and put it away for the rest  of 
the night.
 According to the prison staff, the inmates firmly believed that if  they 
died in prison their souls would be forever trapped there. This  belief was 
so strong that the prison officials would take the elderly inmates  who were 
dying of natural causes to a local hospital so they  would'nt have to die in 
the prison. Maybe their beliefs were well founded.

This is a wonderful recording, were you able  to free any of them?  So sad 
to see them still there behind bars, must be  very lonely for them, they 
should be moving on so, they can start to work on  making up for things on the 
other side.  You folks should go up there  again, and hold a small prayer 
vigil for them, of course they would no longer  be ghosts trapped there, but 
there are plenty more around.  sf

I was invited to spend the night in the West Virginia Penitentiary this  
past weekend.. I was asked to give a short demonstration with my Optimus  
12-797 hacked radio. Deep inside the prison surrounded by concrete and  steel, 
the radio could not pick up any radio stations in manual mode. I  wasn't sure 
how this might effect the demonstration. I was pleasantly  suprised with 
the results. I recorded the session and the results can be  heard at this 
link. _http://www.youtube. com/watch?  v=KwDYu4RULlk_
