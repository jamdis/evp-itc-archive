<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I found this great electronics tutorial online that is easy to 
understand with great diagrams and assumes no prior knowledge of 
electronic circuits. I love tinkering with things, but sometimes when 
more electronically gifted folks here start talking about their work, 
I get overwhelmed because I only understand bits and pieces. This 
tutorial was a great help in that department and I found it very 
useful, perhaps others here might as well...

I feel confident enough to start some breadboard prototyping of some 
of the simple circuits in the back of &quot;Strange Frequencies&quot; by Craig 
Telesha. Obviously my goal here is to build a box according to Frank&#x27;s 
plans, but baby steps for now.

Thanks
Andy</pre>
