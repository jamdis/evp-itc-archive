For some it is all about haunted places. For others theres no such thing as a haunted place. It's a bit different than the work we do but none the less it is still work and putting forth effort with an open mind is what this work is all about no matter which side you approach from. People take many different avenues in the beginning often because they cant quite put a name on what they experienced. Angels, Demons, Spirits, Ghosts, Entities....they are just labels used to describe.
   
  Dont lose patience with them all just because one ticks you off LOL some are on thier way to greater things.
   
  Your boxes have  had success in both types of environments..yours and thiers (ghosthunters). I dont see that as a negative thing Frank. Perhaps a few of the contacting people's intentions are not what they should be. But there are alot of genuine researchers out there that fit both categories. I work from home as well usually but evp can be picked up most anywhere.

work from my basement. I think the only purpose of EVP is to prove to 
oneself that life is forever. I find these "investigation" sites with all 
the ghastly images of demons, skeletons, and ghosts an abomination, and very 
mis-leading to anyone that has any interset in non physical research. It's a 
focus on the frightenning for the purpose of giving cheap thrills or making 
a quick buck.

I'm getting "requests" for my systems from these investigator types for my 
boxes. I would prefer that my stuff not be used for these negative purposes, 
for which is is not designed, nor intended. It's intended to be used as a 
home type reciever system for contact with spirits and other enities, not 
for the rather dubious activity of "ghost investigations".
