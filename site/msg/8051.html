No, I was saying the phototransistors work well. The germanium diode on the other hand was hard to tell what was terrestrial radio and what was transdimensional so it had to be scrapped. The phototransistors are worth looking into though.

Well but at least now we know what they meant about the blue light. LOL so I wouldnt call it a complete failure.

          Juli,

The germanium diode showed a lot of promise in the beginning because of its ability to locate radio signals. Unfortunately, as I experimented with it more and more I noticed that some of the "voices" were weak radio stations, both locally and as far away as Michigan (I'm in Texas). Even though some of the voices I received were genuine in my belief, I had to scrap the idea of Germanium diodes because of its questionable nature.

What I have been playing with lately are different configurations of phototransistors. These things have shown a lot of promise. They react to different colors and intensities of light. The messages I receive have shown to be stronger or weaker depending on the light color and of course loudness by its intensity. So far, blue to violet seems to have the best results.

Frank R.

  Juli,
   
  Thanks for jumpin in there I appreciate it. Work was long so I am trying to play catch up. I agree with you the sound is the carrier. Even in silence voices have been recorded. But I like using sound it has more energy for my sessions.
   
  Actually the h2o method is one of the easier methods for me. I have a standard procedure I follow and I usually only record for about 30 seconds. In that 30 seconds there may be many voices. A few in the normal range and most located in the -74 range. The number of results and clarity varies as with any method sometimes everyone hears it sometimes they hear something else or nothing at all.
   
  As for amount of messages coming thru, I dont record for long periods of time anymore because the sessions are more focused and easier to analyze. Just to
 give an average of results last few sessions I recorded amount of results varied tho recording time was typical @ 30 seconds. Items = number of clips of conversation. 
   
  3-16-08  7 items
  3-13-08 21 items
  3-11-08 17 items
  3-09-08 14 items
   
  It varies in intensity as well as clarity. I experiment with alot of stuff but its always the base method I return to because its how I recieved my first evp.
   
  I think in our hearing each others files alot of the differences we experience not only has to do with how we hear or percieve things has to do with what equipment we use. My speakers may sound different than someone elses so I may not always hear it exactly as they did and vice versa. In fact I am more surprised when people hear some of the words I cant quite make out and xx out hehehe. I will upload a few from recent session to files
 section.
   
  As for the diode thing..refer to the others, cant help ya there =) Frank R was messing with one and a few others here have used them with results.

        William, 
                   I know this was directed for Misty, but if I may I would like to also answer your question.
   
                   The natural back ground noise is used as a "carrier" to reveal the presence of undetectable signals in an ambient.  Misty and many others use water as a source.  I use tap
 water running in an ambient as the source of white noise.  Other noise sources can be used, such as  a fan, or AM radio tuned between the stations (which is also used by many on this board.) 
                     It is important to call your attention to the act that the voices are very weak, and trained ears are necessary for their identification in most cases.  It is very hard because only a few words will become clear among many minutes or hours of tape recording vs. box research.  This was in my case and I use to get completely frustrated in the process.
   
                      Some researchers have upgraded their systems using a germanium diode plugged into the tape recorder's microphone input (1N34 or equivalent).  The
 noise generated by this component, and also ambient detected radio signals, are used as well.
   
                      I have in the past also left a fan running as wind source, which also proved effective.
   
                     I applaud those who focus on this form of communication, for its a lot of hard work and in my opinion.  It takes time, and patience none of which I seem to have anymore and find the box communication more rewarding.
   
  Just my thoughts!

  What is the water method?

  Perhaps it has to do with vibrational frequencies I dont know. Once the lines are open and communication is flowing it gets interesting to say the least =)
   
  Just
 experiment and find whats working best for you personally.

      This is an interesting conversation. Personally, I use my hack to
communicate with a spirit who is definitely grounded. Sometimes the
communications come through as bits of radio waves put together to
form words or sentences, and other times, they sound more like
traditional evps. One of the little things I'm trying to figure out
is why I could never get evps from him after a year of trying, but he
has taken to communicating through the box like a fish to water.
