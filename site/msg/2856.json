The teacher never leaves, everyone who is here has the opportunity to fill those shoes at some point =) We are all equals.\n   \n  It&#39;s the same everywhere, people post files, nobody responds...doesnt mean nobody is listening usually just means either they have nothing to say besides I hear that, or they just dont have the time. A few are just lost as to how the group works maybe LOL.\n   \n  I will tell ya the same thing I tell everyone, dont post your files for response or recognition, if you really just need to ask someone do you hear this or what do you hear my email is always open and eventually I will respond. A few others here will do the same. Just post because you feel the need to share.\n   \n  I post files all the time and get no feedback. I listen to files all the time and give no feedback. It&#39;s not something I take as disrespectful when others do it to me, nor is it meant as any disrespect to those who took time to post and I didnt post feedback. Sometimes theres 5-30 files available that are new for me to listen to in the inbox and by the time ive downloaded and listened to 4 or 5 its time for me to go to work. When I get home same scenario only its time to go to bed. When I seriously need feedback on something I simply send it privately.\n   \n  I listen to you guys files all the time, I really do. I just only have a limited amount of time to touch base on certain things going on around here. I am sure that many others have the same issue. I do respond to emails outside the forums when someone needs me to listen or wants to talk I put them on the top of the priority list.\n   \n  As far as the research bashing or mudslinging... the only thing a good researcher can do is make sure none of those events involve you doing the bashing or the mudslinging and let the rest think what they want to. LOL they will anyway.\n   \n  Take care and enjoy the research! \n   \n  =)\n  Misty\n\nbhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n          This group has turned into a first grade class when the teacher leaves \nthe room !\n\nIt&#39;s supposed to be about a free exchange of idea&#39;s concerning evp-itc\nnot a mud slinging forum or a research bashing arena.\n\nFrank, myself and Steve are continuously posting files and asking for \nfeedback and for the last three months I have gotten maybe one or two \nresponses to my posts and files and I don&#39;t think Steve has gotten any.\nalso it seems like the only reason everyone jumps to reply to a post \nthat frank makes is because he is the man with the boxes, I know there \nwill be a 100 posts now saying &quot;OH THATS NOT TRUE AT ALL&quot; but be truth \nfull with yourselves and you will find that it is.\n\nI myself are guilty of that to a certain extent and I have a Frank&#39;s \nbox already. lets all stop the bull and play nice.
