Thanks to you folks, I have learned to do that too, always save the  
original, it's hard to know how to enhance the correct way, but I tried some of  
Kristin's idea's, which seem to clear it up a little bit, still sounds 
scratchy,  the stronger voice's that come through are people that have probably 
saved up  enough energy somehow to come through stronger though.

You are right-if you have to do too much  enhancing to hear something, then 
you just can't call it EVP.
 
But that really doesn't mean that there  isn't anything there, because 
there could be, but it isn't good enough to be  considered.
 
You can tweak and play with a recording as  long as you want, so long as 
you always keep the original in pristine  condition for comparison. When I go 
to process my audio, upon opening the  track, I immediately save it to 
another name so that I am sure not to  accidentally save over the original.
 
If you have tweaked the audio to the point  that it is completely 
unrecognizable from the original, I would say that may  be too far.
 
"Are we just making ourselves believe there is something there??"
 
Unfortunately I think alot of the  times we are. It is called pareidolia, 
or matrixing. It is a  natural functioning of our brains to pick out familiar 
patterns out  of randomness. Like faces in the clouds and sounds in white 
noise. This  make our job of deciphering what is authentic EVP and what is 
just matrixing  very difficult. You can't even trust yourself entirely.
 
Now before Frank kicks my butt on that, I  need to state the disclaimer 
that this is only if we wish our evidence to  stand up to scientific scrutiny. 
I do  know that there is some value to gut feelings, but gut feelings won't 
get you  anywhere in the scientific world.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] I have a  question.



Now I may be biased to the "investigation" way of doing things.  I  do 
clean up evps if I hear something and can't make it out do to ambient  noise.  
So hear is my question.  When do you stop cleaning  up?  Wouldn't to much 
enhancing "taint" the results?  To me the  more enhancing you do the less 
convincing it becomes.  I hope noone  finds this offensive, it is not meant to be 
I am just really curious.   The way I look at it is that if you have to do 
so much enhancing to find  anything, was there really something there to 
begin with.  Are we just  making ourselves believe there is something  there??
