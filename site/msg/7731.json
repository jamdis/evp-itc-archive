There&#39;s menu on the left side \nthat \n&gt; &gt; should have it listed. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Those RS radios are prabably the most economical way to start \n&gt; &gt; experimenting with that method. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;msm00&quot; &lt;fvshkatie@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m Katie, the founder of Fox Valley Spirit Hunters in Oshkosh \n&gt; WI.  \n&gt; &gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have developed a lot of interest in the audio/video aspect of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; investigating and was pleased to find this group.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a request.  I have been reading up on Frank&#39;s box and \nthe \n&gt; RS \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hack and have been curious to experiment with a gadget of this \n&gt; &gt; sort. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I haven&#39;t gone ahead until now, since I just \n&gt; unexpectedly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; found an older model 12-470 in our local RS store and snapped \nit \n&gt; &gt; up. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What I need are written instructions (versus the video) for the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; modifications needed.  Unfortunately, hubby and I live in the \n&gt; stix \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; do not yet have high speed access. THe videos look wonderful \nbut \n&gt; &gt; simply \n&gt; &gt; &gt; take far too long to download on dialup for us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is someone out there in possession of written instructions and \n&gt; &gt; would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they be willing to share them?  I would really appreciate it.  \n&gt; Thx!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
