<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce,

I&#x27;ve really tried to listen to as many files as I have time for, and 
for the most part, am quite impressed with what people have captured 
from the boxes.  To echo your closing sentiment on flying a little on 
faith that the voices coming through are who they claim to be, I&#x27;d 
like to add that one can never be 100% sure and so I simply accept 
them at face value, giving more weight to to the message than the 
messenger.

&gt; Ann,
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks for listening that batch of files came from a recent session 
when the signal was not at it&#x27;s optimum.
&gt; Some times you will receive a less than adequate session due to the 
conditions at the time the session is in progress
&gt; I and a couple of other researchers  are now in the process of 
documenting the exact conditions present during
&gt; a box session and the different affects some conditions have on the 
clarity and strength of the communication.
&gt;  
&gt; As far as the Elvis message goes, we have to remember that spirits 
where also people at one time and that when 
&gt; we go to the first spiritual level after we leave the physical we 
carry with us many of the characteristics we had in our earthly 
personality.
&gt; some spirits are shy some out going some serious some are comedians.
&gt;  
&gt; I believe the Elvis impersonation was not meant maliciously but as 
a joke. Also the way I determine the validity of the communications I 
receive is
&gt; I have gotten to know my techs and have built a relationship with 
them, I recognise the way they speak and they will even go out of 
their way
&gt; to manipulate certain sound fragments so that the voice they create 
is familiar and recognisable to me. I can pretty much rely on what I 
get from them.
&gt; But you can never be 100% sure, you can only use your best 
judgement and gut instinct and fly a little on faith.

&gt; 
&gt; Bruce--I listened to them all, every single one that got posted 
yesterday.
&gt; 
&gt; I didn&#x27;t comment because I didn&#x27;t find this batch to be as strong 
as yours usually are. Although I meant to post and say that I was 
quite sad that the Elvis we heard might be an impersonator. Would you 
ask them why they allow a fake to come through--since that EVP was 
quite long and elaborately &quot;staged,&quot; for lack of a better term. 
Surely Mike could stop a fake? I&#x27;m very curious about what&#x27;s 
happening over there as we are operating the box, and it is very 
important to me to feel a good amount of certainty that the people 
coming through are who they claim to be. If you can ask, I&#x27;d be 
grateful. I don&#x27;t seem to be able to get those kind of responses yet 
on my own.

&gt; 
&gt; But ,yesterday I posted like 20 files and did not recieve one reply 
on any of them.Yet a post about a broken cell phone recieves a 
hundred replies.What is this group about?Frank is right what the hell 
is the sense of posting files to an EVP-ITCgroup if no one pays 
attention to the evp&#x27;s or files that are posted.I admit I do not 
reply to every single post myself but I do try and reply to most.If 
no one is even bothering to listen to the files you are really 
missing what this is all about.Come o9n guy&#x27;s this is supposed to be 
about the exchange of ideas and constructive suggestions on evp-itc 
research. It&#x27;s not a chat board or a forum for personal 
vendeta&#x27;sLet&#x27;s get with the program and do some evp work.And I&#x27;ll bet 
I get some replies to this post that&#x27;s for sure !Bruce
