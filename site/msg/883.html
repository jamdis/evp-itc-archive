<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Interesting, I get voices about pyramids too, and I have a copper pyramid 
that hangs from my workroom cieling. It&#x27;s lined with aluminum foil, and has 
a quartz sphere in the apex. I used to use it as the echo box, and still 
have a speaker mounted in it. The pyramid was part of a larger meditation 
pyamid, over six feet tall, but I only use the top, made of 3/4 inch copper 
pipe. Hmmm, wonder if I need a pyramidal enlosure for the system?

&gt;Nice find Frank, I&#x27;m sure that kit would do the the job coupled to a motor 
&gt;which in turn is coupled to the tuning dial of a radio. Maybe there is 
&gt;enough random information to do a simple sweep, the radio signals are 
&gt;constantly modulated with changing information. The part that has got me 
&gt;thinking is how some of the voices drag across several different stations 
&gt;and sound like the same voice. At first thought it appears to have 
&gt;something to do with amplitude variation and time. I can sometimes get the 
&gt;&#x27;dragging voice&#x27; effect using EVP maker, it is not nearly as clean as the 
&gt;radio method. I have to look through my stuff in the basement, I think I 
&gt;may have a Delco auto-tuning car radio from about 1970 that was mechanical.
&gt;I&#x27;m attaching a reverse playback message from today.
&gt;&quot;Pyramids helpful.....That&#x27;s a secret&quot;

&gt;This is from Gateway Electronics, they used to have a store here, but 
&gt;closed
&gt;it. I almost bought one of these! This would be great for tuning a radio,
&gt;and I bet it would be farly easy to randonly control, but that may not be
&gt;necessary, maybe like Dave said, just steady tuning acorss the band, back
&gt;and forth?
