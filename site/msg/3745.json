It was very simple and easy on my part,  all I \ndid was ask for help and the help was provided.  I have actually  reached out \nand touched somebody, LOLOL.  Sorry I always loved that phrase  from the \nphone company.  But I have reached out and touched, to my  amazement.  But when I \nhave played back he recordings of the sessions a lot  of the audio is not \nthere.  There is the truth that some things are only  meant for me to hear and not \nfor anyone else.  I wish they could be  recorded so I could substantiate this \nbut at this time I cannot.  And as  you already know they do have the ability \nto predict the future.  Some  things about the future we should never know \nbut alas it does come thru to  us.  Again it could not be recorded or \nsubstantiated.    I  am still waiting for a certain date to come to see if the predicted \nfuture will  actually happen.  I pray that it doe not.  But in the even that \nit  does you will be the first ones to be informed of this.\n \nJeff\n\n\n\n**************************************Check out AOL&#39;s list of 2007&#39;s hottest \nproducts.\n(http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)\n\r\n-------------------------------1196706817\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3DUS-ASCII&quot;&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16544&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY id=\r\n=3Drole_body style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot; =\r\n\nbottomMargin=3D7 leftMargin=3D7 topMargin=3D7 rightMargin=3D7&gt;&lt;FONT id=3Dr=\r\nole_document \nface=3DArial color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Frank,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I have received real contact.&nbsp; It was very simple a=\r\nnd easy on my part, \nall I did was ask for help and the help was provided.&=\r\nnbsp; I have actually \nreached out and touched somebody, LOLOL.&nbsp; Sorry=\r\n I always loved that phrase \nfrom the phone company.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;have =\r\nreached out and touched, to my \namazement.&nbsp; But when I have played bac=\r\nk he recordings of the sessions a lot \nof the audio is not there.&nbsp; The=\r\nre is the truth that some things are only \nmeant for me to hear and not for=\r\n anyone else.&nbsp; I wish they could be \nrecorded so I could substantiate =\r\nthis but at this time I cannot.&nbsp; And as \nyou already know they do have=\r\n the ability to predict the future.&nbsp; Some \nthings about the future we =\r\nshould never know but alas it does come thru to \nus.&nbsp; Again it could n=\r\not be recorded or substantiated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I \nam still waiting for =\r\na certain date to come to see if the predicted future will \nactually happen=\r\n.&nbsp; I pray that it doe not.&nbsp; But in the even that it \ndoes you wil=\r\nl be the first ones to be informed of this.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Je=\r\nff&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;color: black; font: normal 1=\r\n0pt ARIAL, SAN-SERIF;&quot;&gt;&lt;HR style=3D&quot;MARGIN-TOP: 10px&quot;&gt;Check out AOL Money &=\r\n Finance&#39;s list of the &lt;A title=3D&quot;http://money.aol.com/special/hot-product=\r\ns-2007?NCID=3Daoltop00030000000001&quot; href=3D&quot;http://money.aol.com/special/ho=\r\nt-products-2007?NCID=3Daoltop00030000000001&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hottest prod=\r\nucts&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A title=3D&quot;http://money.aol.com/top5/general/ways-you-are-was=\r\nting-money?NCID=3Daoltop00030000000002&quot; href=3D&quot;http://money.aol.com/top5/g=\r\neneral/ways-you-are-wasting-money?NCID=3Daoltop00030000000002&quot; target=3D&quot;_b=\r\nlank&quot;&gt;top money wasters&lt;/A&gt; of 2007.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n-------------------------------1196706817--"}
