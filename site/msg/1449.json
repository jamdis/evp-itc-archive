(Baseball?) (Football?) etc.\n\nDid you have any hobbies?\n\nWhat do you miss the most?\n\n-------------------------------\n\nI&#39;ve gotten some interesting responses.  Last year I asked &quot;Do you know \nwhat year it is?&quot; and a woman&#39;s voice plainly said &quot;1996&quot;. On one \ninvestigation I asked &quot;Do you want us to leave?&quot; and a male voice said \n&quot;You just got here.&quot; At another site someone asked &quot;What was your cause \nof death?&quot; and I heard &quot;poisoning&quot;.\n\nIt&#39;s funny when the ghosts join in on your conversations even though \nyou&#39;re not asking questions.  Some of them are very playful.\n\nI was on one investigation a couple years ago when someone asked &quot;Do you \nknow the Cubs are in the World Series this year?&quot;  :-)\n\nIf you are at the location of a tombstone you can ask if the person is \n(name on tombstone) or knows (name on tombstone).\n\nI hope those help a little bit.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Thu, 28 Jun 2007, Steve Hultay wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I want to do another EVP session with the box, but am tired of asking\n&gt; the same questions.
