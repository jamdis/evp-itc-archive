 When you get a voice that talks about a specific situation, does that pro=
ve something is talking that is not a broadcast fragment? We do have a dog =
with a broken leg, so it would seem outrageous to suggest the comment recei=
ved about a dog and a break would be just a stray broadcast. I hate to have=
 an animal suffer, but what a piece of evidence! This is what I mean  by ju=
dging content and context.   I don't ask questions, I did not ask about the=
 dog. I was only testing the #24 box, and announced, as usuall, that I was =
doing an EVP recording to test the box.   Frank-S
