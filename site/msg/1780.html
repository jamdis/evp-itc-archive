<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Juli,

Just catching up with this.  Many thanks for your comments.  I agree
that messages sometimes do not pertain to place, but to someone who
needs the message, and who may not even be present.  That happens
sometimes with &quot;regular&quot; EVP, and may account for why some messages
don&#x27;t make much sense.

&gt; I just wanted to say that what I really find amazing with the make 
&gt; up of the box, that no matter what field your working in 
&gt; (paranormal, UFO&#x27;s etc.)is the fact that if a message needs to be 
&gt; delivered it will find a way of coming through to the right people 
&gt; to be delivered.  
&gt; 
&gt; I really believe that there is a hugh misconception that the box 
&gt; needs to be at specific location and will only recieve the messages 
&gt; pretaining to the history there, which is so not true.  
&gt; 
&gt; I know in on many occassions that a special message was to be 
&gt; delivered to certain people, especially in times of trouble and 
&gt; the &quot;greater powers that be&quot; have followed through alerting us, when 
&gt; the box was not in our possession, which is an example in RoseMary 
&gt; Ellen&#x27;s case. Knowing RoseMary Ellen personally, I can tell you that 
&gt; she has devoted much of her life to the paranormal and through her 
&gt; writings and teachings have been able to convey messages in many 
&gt; ways and her intentions are sincere.
&gt; 
&gt; I do have a theory on this, and is only my opinion.  
&gt; 
&gt; I have watched and observed the box on many occassions.  I have 
&gt; worked on many evp&#x27;s from the box, and for the most I understand 
&gt; much of what is coming through immediately. I have had one on one 
&gt; conversations many with the same voices and reconized them.  I see 
&gt; how many people claim it doesn&#x27;t work or they can not understand 
&gt; it.  Me however, truly believe that people whomn are &quot;pure&quot; with 
&gt; their intensions and their heart is in the right place with their 
&gt; research can fully understand and make a connect with the 
&gt; otherside.  The otherside know&#x27;s who they are and what they stand 
&gt; for and build a respect for them to carry on their work.  
&gt; 
&gt; I myself do not have a box at this moment, base on a respect issue 
&gt; for Frank and his work.  See, I truly believe that when you are 
&gt; suppose to acquire this tool of communication, the message will come 
&gt; through to let you know, and only then if your dedicated and 
&gt; passionate, should you be an advocate for the otherside.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; These are just my thoughts.....
&gt; 
&gt; Juli
