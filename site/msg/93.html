this is a concept i have not been able to conceive........BUT thats the whole point i guess. The whole idea behind EVP, that it seems INCONCEIVABLE! So, having said that, there is a great possibility that they are able to change the messeges POST recording. ITS all electronic, and they are OBVIOUSLY able to manipulate sounds to thier liking to produce thier voices. SO WHY NOT!
  Maybe they wanted you to hear something and wanted me to hear something, so the events that lead to me NOT being able to send out messages to the group, and that i had time to play around and listen to those tapes, maybe they needed me to hear something for you, or a messege for me or that you and me needed to join heads!
  it is quite intriguing <dunno how to spell that> when you put all the pieces together!
  Maybe you should try talking to them about me and see what they have to say?
  It could very well just be a fluke too, IN that they knew i was going to have problems and you were gonna be the one to help me out that day. Thats something they knew that was correct! They hadnt mentioned me before or since........hummmmm
  who know? ask em! they like to give you info!

              Well, they just give me these predictions from time to time, usually I don�t hear it right, or they�re just wrong, but they have some hits. In March I got that voice �June 16th there�ll be no one left to use (or hear) your boxes� They said the 16th cuz something is supposed to happen on the 15th. I�ve been getting little bits of update information from them ever since. So I was trying to get some confirmation. It�s not that it upsets me, it�s confusing when nothing happens, cuz then I don�t know how much I can trust anything I hear form the voices. This voice is from April 17th, and it�s really distorted.

     I have my own �group� on the other side, or on the etheric levels, that claim I�m one of theirs, that�s why I get this stuff. 

     I have no fear of death, I�ve even gone to where some of these voices said I was supposed to have a heart attack, and just stood there thinking how interesting it was, and mentally telling them �brave enough for ya�. It�s a line from the movie �Defending Your Life�. 

     I doubt if they are talking about somewhere else, but they may have their times all mixed. I think when events, like asteroid impacts happen, it creates time ripples, and we pick these up in our voices. The closer we get to the event, the stronger the voices, and ripples get.

            ok heres a stupid question frank


      are these the kind of things that you want to know from "them"? are they just telling you? AND if they upset you why dont you tell them to stop? I personally would NOT like them telling me this type of information, true or untrue, i lean toward the OCD side, <obsessive compulsive disorder> my mom has it severe and somethings i have it bad too.................like about death, and i get feelings about not driving a certain route to somewhere etc so this kind of stuff makes my brain hurt lol


      just wondering why you do evp and how it evolved to getting "PRIVILAGED" information from them?  Do you wonder if theyre talking about somewhere other than HERE? maybe in thier realm or things that have already happened?


      curosity kills me lol
