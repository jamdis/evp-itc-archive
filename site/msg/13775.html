      Well, if=
 my husband would let me actually experiment with one, that would be the fi=
rst step LOL!

      But what I would try and do is get some kind of verifi=
able information from the "entity" that I contact with the board to prove t=
hat it is communication from an actual, intelligent being and not just my o=
wn motor responses making he planchette move. It would have to be informati=
on that I have no knowledge of.

      If I could do that, and consistently=
, then I would be comfortable saying that I am actually talking to a spirit=
.

      The reason I have my doubts is that you have to be touching the pl=
anchette to get it to move. If it were an actual spirit, I would think that=
 shouldn't be necessary. We all know ghosts can a do move objects.

      B=
ut this brings up another mystery - if the Ouija board is actual spirit com=
munication, maybe there is a difference between the entities you can contac=
t with it and your common ghost.

        .


        When it comes to the Ou=
ija, I just want to study it to find out if it is really spirit communicati=
on, or just kinetic energy or your subconscious mind moving the planchette.=


        I agree that we all have the ability for extra sensory perception=
, just some are better at it than others. Like running, for instance. We al=

 get better.

        But that is not my aim with the Ouija.

          You forgot yawn from boredom, that'=

          Use it, don't use it.  I don't care.  Bu=

          There's always=
 the question in the back of your mind whether your partner's moving it.  T=
