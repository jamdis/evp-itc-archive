<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Steve.  I only have a minute to respond, but will come back later.  I have gotten only 
ONE clear (class A) EVP with my DR60.  Most everything is garbled (but intelligible much of 
the time) yet I still find it a fascinating little unit.  My clip is titled &quot;This is Shawn that&#x27;s 
talking&quot; and it&#x27;s in the folder called &#x27;traditional evp&#x27; under my main folder.

&gt; I got this recorder a couple weeks back, but haven&#x27;t messed with it  much.  
&gt; But every time i record, i get an EVP.  This recorder is really  strange, it 
&gt; seems like it doesn&#x27;t have great sound quality for recording  us.  The answers 
&gt; are much clearer than the questions.  I know this  isn&#x27;t box research, but it&#x27;s 
&gt; still communication.  Like i said, i never  settle on one style.  To me, all 
&gt; styles work and if you mix it up it will  never get boring as long as we are 
&gt; getting results.  Here are just  a few traditional Evp&#x27;s i thought were pretty 
&gt; good and worth sharing, the  thing is that i hardly had to touch these files.  
&gt; What you hear is pretty  close to the original files, listen and let me know 
&gt; what you guys think.   Has anybody else got good stuff from this panasonic 
&gt; recorder, if so i would love  to hear it.
&gt;
