By double-clicking an entry in the cue list, the according section within the waveform will be selected, and by clicking the play button, the allophone will be played. You can also select and play more than one allophone by dragging the selection while pressing the left mouse button, and then click play.\n\nYou will notice that most EVP are composed of allophones that apparently don&#39;t match, or which obviously aren&#39;t intended by the chip designers to be used for this particular speech element. Other allophones are misplaced or superfluous, but will be simply ignored by our hearing. Nevertheless, EVPs that are composed of apparently &quot;wrong&quot; allophones sound amazingly clear to us, while &quot;correctly&quot; synthesized speech, as for instance my sample file &quot;Hello, good morning&quot; (see \nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Stefan/Speech%20Recognition%20Training/SJ-HelloGoodMorning.mp3) doesn&#39;t sound very well.\n\nThis shows that our hearing is very flexible, and that spirit entities have more possibilities than the mathematically expected number to combine allophones to their intended messages.\n\nStefan\n\n\n\n                           \n\n\nMichael Edwards:  f1cracker75@...\n       \n---------------------------------\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
