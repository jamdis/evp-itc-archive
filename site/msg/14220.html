While some codes are used differently, many are used the same.
All the 10 c=
ode references I've found indicate a 10-7 is an out of service.
Can you poi=
nt to a reference that shows a different meaning?

Code 7 is either c=
ode for being out of service (short for 10-7), or a meal break:

      Tonight at work I was talking to =
a state trooper, there had been an accident. I asked him if there were any =
deaths (it was very very bad) and he said he didnt know so he got on his ra=
dio and called in and asked them if it was a 7 at the site. They told him n=
egative, and he told me the little boy who was the worst off was still aliv=
e. I asked him why did you ask them if it was a 7. He said code 7, I was as=
king them if they were dead. So if you ever hear anyone call 7 over the rad=
io that means someones dead.

Just thought I would pass that on. I find =
it interesting since I know alot of us have heard this before when used to =
describe who is speaking rather than a name they say seven.
