According to some, &quot;...the Spirit Technicians and Spirit \nGuides on the other side have repeatedly explained that the way that \nthe Telephone to the Dead technology works, is by spirit energy \nmanipulating the random voltage generator (RVG) and using white and \npink noise, as well as radio fragment, to create real time voice \nanswers to questions posed from our side. The most important aspect \nto this device is the medium operator who works as an antenna \nor &quot;interpreter&quot; for living individuals asking the questions.&quot;\n\nSo, that said (or copied and pasted) I have decided that my next \nattempt with the older version of the 12-470 will be the following:\n\n1) Add a method of variable voltage used to adjust the tuning \ncircuit, similar to the RVG mentioned above. I went out and purchased \nanother older 12-470 today, to do just this.\n(Frank... I did some measurements of that VT and found a range to \nwork with.. I hope!)\n\n2) Add that white or pink noise to be mixed with the sweeping raw \naudio already available from the modified 12-470.\n\n3) Add an internal antenna for the 12-470.\n\n4) Add an interface so the user will be a active/passive part of the \nradio. As mentioned above, as the antenna between the \nentities/spirits.\n\nSo... if I can accomplish all that... maybe the little ole&#39; 12-470 \nwill be recognized by the &quot;experts&quot;, as having what the big mahcines \nnow have... :-)\n\nWish me luck in my adventure... and oh, by-the-way... I hope to add \nall this, inside the existing case.\n\n- Mike"}
