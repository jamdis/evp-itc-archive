Maybe you can break thru the skepticism surrounding modern day evp methods. They did a show on the subject before and were none too receptive to the idea. Well let me rephrase that...one was open to possibility it &quot;might&quot; exist, other thought there was no way evp is coming thru a radio...its just radio fragments. I find this happens alot on many different forums.\n   \n  Sometimes even the most openminded are closed to new ideas of change in regards to what they think they know is true. \n   \n  Invite them to try it or even just try manual sweep tuning at a quick rate when they arent on air. I have had wonderful results with that including live feedback when I heard a name mentioned (I now recognize LOL) during a session while Frank R was working on his laser setup. Attaching a few samples below.\n   \n  Good luck!\n  Misty\n\n&quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n          I have been invited to be a guest tonight on TAPS Family Radio.
