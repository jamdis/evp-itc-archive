Since my pers=
onal results do not show anything paranormal,  I ask experts to help with t=
he tests: the experts being the people here. That I way I can learn.  I hav=
e contributed a testing process so far, run several public tests, and even =
though they were not positive results, I did not "tout it all over the web"=
.  I have not criticized.  I just don't automatically believe everything pe=
ople tell me.

I don't understand why you would think that should be reason=
 to be kicked out of the group.

 That is really obnoxious=
! Like no one knows all you want to do is build up a list of failed predict=
ions so you can tout it out all over the web and make a name for yourself. =
There are some here that suggest you be kicked off the group cuz you contri=
bute nothing, can't do any recordings of your own, can't hear any of the EV=
Ps, can't see any of the images, yet are quick to criticize and test everyo=

 Same old thing, heard them talking about "it hits the earth" a=

is stuff. Who knows if it means anything, but what I don't like are those t=

 The unconverted wave sounds a littel better=
, but it's over 3mb.
