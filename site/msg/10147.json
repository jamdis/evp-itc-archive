In the \nfile I have in my folder of the 30 second test of #36, the very first \nvoice is &quot;Thomas Edison(sung)--I Never Visited Frank&quot;, I did not hear \nthis until the third time I listened to the entire session. I&#39;m not so \nintent on runing session after session all friggin&#39; day that I don&#39;t \nhave/take time to listen. If I was trying to hear this stuff direct, I \nwould miss it, and simialr voices about 99% of the time. That&#39;s why, \nforget the damn questions, and just listen--over and over till you \nthink you&#39;ve gotten it all. Even my dad, and son come through in their \nown time, I don&#39;t costantly ask for them. I swear to God, they know who \nis listening, when you are listening/recording, and what you need to \nknow! Trust it!\n\n I know, the idiot scientist type will insist you have to ask \nquestions, and confirm the answers, but that is BS, and results little \nuseful information. Useful, as in has personal signifgance. \n\n Frank-S"}
