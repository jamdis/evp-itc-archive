I can hear that
   
  I think the group forum is just an outlet for researchers who wish to share ideas and results. Since most everyone who joins a group forum about evp already believes in the fact it exists, they have less questions as to why it happens than the average joe.
   
  You are right about the ego trips getting in the way. I have noticed most research groups go thru the problem of having disagreements or fighting and it usually has nothing to do with the research going on, it has more to do with clashing personalities who just cant take thier fighting out of the public forum or let go of the negativity completely. Whether its ego or just human error, it nevertheless hinders whats trying to be accomplished.
   
  When we get wrapped up in proving a point to someone who refuses to hear, we waste our energy, we get angry, we lower our vibration. That in turn attracts lower vibration entities. 
   
  Interesting enough, last night I was listening to an old recording of Ghostly Talk with Mark Macy and he was talking about his group of 13 and how they had tried to focus thier thoughts and energies to stay positive to help improve thier research/communications. Even amongst a close knit group of 13 private members they had some problems accomplishing that...staying on the same level of positivity. Whether its life getting in the way or your own emotions, negativity always tries to find a way in.
   
  I think perhaps it is more about finding a balance of the positive and the negative aspects of life, dealing with negativity in a positive manner rather than becoming part of the negative energy flow.
   
  Theres old sayings about kaarma....what goes around comes around. What you put out to the universe you get thrown back at you times three. And theres an old saying in the evp community "like attracts like". I think both ideas hold one basic truth.
   
  As for the skeptics, you dont have to prove anything to them. Why waste the time? If you are bored and you have that much time to kill I have a few group experiments for you to try out that will keep you busy LOL

   I get more intelligent questions about audio, and video ITC on non EVP groups, than I have ever gotten from these EVP groups. I get a much better discussion going if I go to various �new age� groups, and get away from the EVP groups. To me, not wanting to sound negative, and I am guilty too, but it seems everyone is so intent on sharing, and presenting what they get it becomes a contest of egos.
