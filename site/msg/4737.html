It might be the person, this morning while "sitting" in the bathroom 
I'm seeing pig faces on the towels, and wondering where the hell am I 
going to see pigs on new years day!? So I go in the kitchen, and the 
wife has animal planet on and it's about some womans pet pigs! I get 
the same effect in the voices, I often hear stuff I'll hear in the 
imediate future. Most of the time it seems it's trivial stuff. If I try 
to listen for those profound bits of truth I get whacko prophecy crap 
that never happens, and lunatic space aliens. It's the fact of the 
voices that keeps me working, not the information that I get through 
it.
