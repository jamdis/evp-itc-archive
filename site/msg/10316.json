I tried to clean it up using wavepad, but their \nwas this annoying ringing sound I tried to get out of it.  I got all of \nthis message when the radio shack hack was scanning the band, and it \nall in a row no cut and pasteing or taking out garbage.  I will remove \nthis pretty quick because its embarassing, so you might want to listen \nto only a few seconds in it. It might be anonying lol I will post the \noriginal if anybody is interested.\n\nWilliam Rees C."}
