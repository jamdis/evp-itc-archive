 [EVP-ITC] Box Sale !!!!





I bought a couple extra 12-587 radios today a=
nd hacked them, so i can offer them
to the group to those who are having a =
hard time finding them.

They were like $32 with tax plus whatever shipping=
 cost to your location would
be. I also have other boxes for sale:

RS 12-5=
87----$32 plus shipping-(Actual Cost of unit)

MiniBox Plus----$400 plus sh=
ipping-(I paid $550 originally)

Joe's Box----$150. 00-(I paid $250 origina=
lly)

MiniBox 2----$150

Let me know if anyone is interested in any or all =
of the boxes, i need to free
up some space in my home and am offer them at =
a discounted rate. I rarely have
time to use all of these, so they must go.=
 I figured that i would offer the
group first before putting them on Ebay.
