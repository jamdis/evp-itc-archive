<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, been told this. I get the impression there&#x27;s some joining this group
hoping to get their ghost huntng or spirit beliefs validated, or confirmed,
when they hear this junk they bail. This stuff is ITC, Instrumental
Trans-Communication. That can be audio, video, or still images. I think
there is a mis-conception in the paranormal whatever world that EVP is ghost
voice, weak whispery barely audible noise, and ITC is video feedback loop
images, an never shall the two ever, ever mix. Some seem to think it&#x27;s all
perfectly well defined and laid down in laws and protocols. Afterall it&#x27;s
repeated on TV week after weak after week.

 I managed to completely offend the guy that told me about the embedded
images, Richard Roberts. He started laying down all these absolute
undeniabel laws and definitions of EVP, and when I disagreed openly, he got
all pissed off, deleted all his Facebook content, and went away, sulking in
some dark internet corner I guess. I feel bad about offending him, but come
on! Grow up out there.

 Think I&#x27;ll replace the tuner in this box, too frikin&#x27; noisy. I don&#x27;t have
tuners to spare, but this one is unacceptabel.

 F-S
