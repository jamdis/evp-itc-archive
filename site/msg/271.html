thats progress. Its programming, from our family and society to ignore and tune out whats going on because if you hear them or see them "YOU ARE CRAZY"! They used to way back when they thought you were posessed literally drill into your skull to release the demon that possesed you. Not to metion other things lol. Its just not socially acceptable to believe that spirits are here but even more so to publically say that you can hear them or see them. What everyone is doing with ghost hunting evp seance etc etc etc, we are closet believers! My mom is the only one that i can talk to about this, the rest of my family would have me committed. So, her saying that maybe its for her, she said it, not you. I am thinking that this expierience has shook her. That death really does happen. Or that something triggered the belief that you can go on. Either way, take it slow, try to get her involved, just a little at a time. Make it interesting for her. How about seeing if she wants to
 record with you. Do a basic session, like on your pc, or a tape deck, have her do the questions with you. Then if you get EVP she will know that you two were the only ones there. Or like i said go on a ghost hunt, i dont know if you blong to a ghost hunt society in your town? <i do>. Make it a date! Be like this is so cool! I want to take you to this ghost hunt, ive never been to this place and i want you there with me. Then if you can get her to go, DONT TELL HER, but after wards or before, take her out to dinner and a movie, to her favorite place. She will then associate the hunt with fun and a date with you! GOOD expereince instead of fear.

Sometimes I wonder if we get stuck sometimes trying to wake up just one person.

          yall should get into that conversation sometime, has she ever gotten involved in your work? Have you tried to involve her? Maybe she feels scared or put off, or not wanted <involving> hell if i know lol

    how about taking her on a "hunt". See how she respioinds to that.

    Since i have been delving into this more, i am less scared of death, still scared ofcourse but less. I tell my husband not to worry that ill stick around, ill be back. That gives me alot of comfort actually, that i dont HAVE to leave.

    oooh yeah almost forgot, do you think the heartattack warnings were NOT for YOU?

    maybe relistening to that evp might clarify?
