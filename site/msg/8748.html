<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Stefan.  I&#x27;m hoping my article did a good job of countering Alec&#x27;s take on the radio 
sweep.  &quot;To Sweep or Not to Sweep&quot; was written by me.  :-)

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; just received the latest AA-EVP NewsJournal. Especially the radio sweep
&gt; method and EVPmaker are discussed quite controversially in this issue.
&gt; Alec MacRae for instance wrote:

&gt; Like EVPmaker, the swept receiver method is capable of producing EVP,
&gt; but it is also even more capable of producing false results. Some years
&gt; ago, I did a series of experiments with EVPmaker.... What EVPmaker does
&gt; is take a few seconds of speech, chop it into little pieces called
&gt; phonemes and then randomize these phonemes. If you are lucky, you will
&gt; find EVP.
&gt; 
&gt; What some people do, frustrated at not getting very much, is they make
&gt; the slices wider, so then what you are getting are actually sizeable
&gt; little chunks of the sentence. Actual words are still there. In that
&gt; case you seem to be getting more EVP, but what you are getting is simply
&gt; a rearranged sentence.
&gt; ---- end quote ----
&gt; 
&gt; My comment on this:
&gt; 
&gt; If only phonemes are used, as is the case for the SpeakJet allophones
&gt; file, this won&#x27;t happen, since this source material definitely doesn&#x27;t
&gt; already contain speech. In order to rule out doubts as to getting &quot;false
&gt; EVPs&quot;, only audio sources should be used in the future which aren&#x27;t
&gt; already finished speech. So perhaps using SJ allophones are one step
&gt; towards the right direction. Interesting, that this comes up right now...
