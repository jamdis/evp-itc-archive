I have about 70 of the LM3820 chips, they are an AM radio chip,\n&gt; with all functions except the audio detector. I had trouble getting this\n&gt; chip to work a couple years ago, but since I&#39;ve learned some tricks, like\n&gt; adding the oscillator buffer to keep the freq counter from pulling the\n&gt; frequency way off, other wise, ya think you have the frequency range set,\n&gt; but in use it&#39;s completely out of the AM band, so no stations get picked\n&gt; up.Then I was not aware of how to set up the ferrite rod antenna. The\n&gt; 602/612s are $2 something each, the Lm3820--12 cents from B. G. Micro(in\n&gt; tubes of 25). I set up the oscillator last night, then re-drew the\n&gt; schematic. I used a regulated supply to hopefully make the oscialltor more\n&gt; stable, but the chip will function on 12 volts-besides, come to think about\n&gt; it, it has a built in regulator, so the 8V regulator is overkill, maybe even\n&gt; harmful in that  the internal regulator wouldn&#39;t have enough head room.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\nI know i 's mo e complica ed, bu ha e you hough o using a di ec equency syn hesis chip like he Analog De ices AD9835 o AD9850 and a PIC o AVR mic ocon olle o adjus he equency?
