All kidding aside, I do want a puck\npretty bad. For ITC work, it has a much larger vocabulary, and you can\nhave it save and write a log file for later review. And as always, you\ncan use a prg. such as Audacity to capture the session in real time.\nAnother huge plus about the puck is that there are I believe 9 sensors\nfor emf and temperature, and it has datalogging ability. That makes it\nworth it right there, kindof a swiss-army knife of paranormal\ninstrumentation. Also if I am looking at the device right, it looks\nlike there is an expansion port for future upgradeability. I would\nlove to be able to purchase one of Bill&#39;s &quot;research units&quot; which as I\nunderstand it, is a puck with more sensors and goodies.\n\nOne benefit to the ovilus is that it is handheld, but the handicaps\noutweigh that benefit if you are looking for better vocabulary, emf\nreadings, and logfile records. I hear the next version of the ovilus\nwill have some of those features. I really cannot wait to get my hands\non this technology, and even moreso now after reviewing the files of\ngroup members here who have used these devices.\n\nthanks, \nAndy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;juswitchy&quot; &lt;Alwaysguess@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Was jus wondering what you all thought of the Ovilus and the puck?
