I&#39;m wondering, though, why do you need hard evidence?  Who for?  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jay&quot; &lt;jeremy2infinity@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks to Frank for letting me join.I want to build my own box and I think I have enough parts.I wont lie and say it&#39;s tempting to just go buy one lol.The house I live in now I believe is haunted but not by a malicious entity.The previous ovner was an elderly widow.It is known that she passed away in this home.I dont know if her husband met the same fate nor do I know if she died of natural causes or not but I assume she had.All 3 of us who live here have seen,heard or felt something.None of this was known to me until I brought it up to my girlfriend one day,whome I live here with along with her 12 year old son.WE have chosen not to mention anything to him so as not to disturb his mindframe.We all agree tha twe have felt liek we were being watched and we also tend to get glimpses of what feels like something peeking at us from around a corner.Her son wont sleep without a nightlight on thoguh he keeps his bedroom door closed,nor will he go in the basement alone at night.When its only him and myself here at home he tands to hold long conversations with himself as if someone else is in the room.He states that hes just talking to himself.I want to try to get some kind of hard evidence,so I&#39;m goign to have to figure something out.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
