answer to margaret&quot;  are y&#x27;all talking about people that answer in lengthy post.  Unless the 
post is worth reading, and is something about the GB research.  I will read the whole post, 
but if its about something not pertaining to the GB research &quot;delete&quot;.  Thats just how it is!!!
&gt;   I am probaly totaly off subject, but I just had a look at the Subject, and that was the 
first thing that came out!

&gt; I hate to admit this but when I first heard about the Franks box on 
&gt; paranormal state I went to ebay to see if there were any on there. I 
&gt; also did a search for Ghost box but lucky for me there wasnt any on 
&gt; ebay at the time, cause I would of foolishly paid the $49.95 plus 
&gt; shipping to get the RS hack that is on ebay now. (dont think I would 
&gt; of gone as high as some of the bidder have gone)

&gt; &gt; Margaret,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In my initial reply I voiced my disdain for low lives that take 
&gt; advantage of unwary people
&gt; &gt; but did not advocate any action by any researchers on this board.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My goal is not just pacifism for it&#x27;s own sake, believe me any of 
&gt; the old timers here can attest to my temper.
&gt; &gt; My concern is for the negative disruption in the energy flow of 
&gt; the communication.
&gt; &gt; I think that following the example of &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; will 
&gt; be very well received on the other side and therefore 
&gt; &gt; contribute to strengthening the bridge.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In the past couple of days I know Kristin has received messages 
&gt; about the seven and the circle, 
&gt; &gt; these are metaphors for peace, harmony and cooperation of energies 
&gt; within the communication.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is not the first time we have received messages with these 
&gt; examples, I personally have received numerous 
&gt; &gt; messages pertaining to circle, circles and the power of seven. It 
&gt; has been contemplated in length here more than once.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have, through interpretation of communication over a long period 
&gt; of time, come to PERSONALLY believe that the urgence of 
&gt; &gt; harmony and positive energy is the fertilizer of the growth of our 
&gt; communication with the spirit world.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m sorry, I drifted off the subject at hand, but my reason is 
&gt; relevant to this commentary. 
&gt; &gt; Taking any action against this ebay fool will first and foremost 
&gt; serve our ego&#x27;s and secondly
&gt; &gt; may help to provide information to unwary buyers that is contrary 
&gt; to what this thief is putting out.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But could that not be accomplished through other venues that would 
&gt; help to educate many more people that
&gt; &gt; are would be box researchers and do not look to ebay as a source 
&gt; for an RS hack. But are seeking general knowledge.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And Margaret to thine own self be true, when this was brought up 
&gt; my first reaction was to figure out a way to sabotage
&gt; &gt; this guy&#x27;s business venture. After thinking it over and asking 
&gt; myself what the first reason for doing that would be. My answer
&gt; &gt; Was, to get this asshole that is exploiting something that I hold 
&gt; very dear, and in turn help to steer unaware buyers away from 
&gt; getting screwed.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But still my initial and primal reason was to inflict some sort of 
&gt; punishment on a person that I felt was unscrupulous. And I decided 
&gt; that this was
&gt; &gt; a negative emotion and would generate negative energy, no matter 
&gt; how I tried to convince myself it was in the name of justice.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That goes without even mentioning the fact that we are not the say 
&gt; all and do all of this research. There are other entities involved 
&gt; that I would think 
&gt; &gt; have better influential power than we do. If they want it stopped 
&gt; they will find a way to stop it. I know what your going to say, 
&gt; maybe we are the 
&gt; &gt; tools they are using to stop this injustice. That may very well 
&gt; be, and if so then that is the way it will play out.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think you mistake what I am implying. I am not saying do 
&gt; nothing, quite the opposite. It is actually our duty to do 
&gt; something. All I&#x27;m saying is there 
&gt; &gt; are alternative ways to educate unwary possible researchers that 
&gt; would be 100% positive and not entail any type of stone throwing 
&gt; tactics.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have said my piece now at the expense of boring everyone to 
&gt; death. So I will see how this unfolds, and during my daily session 
&gt; will inquire about how our friends feel about it.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi Bruce. I don&#x27;t see this so much as an assault on anyone, as it 
&gt; is simply bringing awareness into a forum (ebay) where it is 
&gt; desperately needed. Was it not you who recently stated sellers who 
&gt; take advantage of others in this way are &quot;no more than thieves 
&gt; without guns&quot; and &quot;should not be patronized no matter the 
&gt; circumstances.&quot; You have characterized them as &quot;wolves&quot; and &quot;demons&quot; 
&gt; but now are saying &quot;do nothing.&quot; Which, honestly, I could understand 
&gt; if my suggestion was coming from a place of vengeance. It is 
&gt; not.THIS IS ABOUT EDUCATION FIRST AND FOREMOST, and standing up for 
&gt; those who are, unknowingly, being taken advantage of. The byproduct 
&gt; of providing this education will be allowing consumers to make an 
&gt; informed decision and if that hurts the sales of unscrupulous 
&gt; sellers, then so be it. Ann has just echoed some of my remarks in 
&gt; earlier posts in support of sellers rights to take advantage of the 
&gt; market ... that some people may find it&#x27;s worth it to pay more to 
&gt; someone to receive a previously hacked unit. I would venture to 
&gt; guess, this educational information will A) help prevent those who 
&gt; are capable of doing the hack themselves from being duped, and B) 
&gt; force sellers who do offer pre-hacked units to do so for a 
&gt; more &#x27;reasonable&#x27; fee. This is neither spiteful nor aggressive, and 
&gt; it&#x27;s certainly not any kind of vengeance driven on my part. It&#x27;s 
&gt; standing up for the uninformed, leveling the playing field for 
&gt; sellers, and it&#x27;s bringing more people the knowledge that 
&gt; doing &#x27;box&#x27; research is not an exclusive club that only the rich can 
&gt; take part in (and given the pricing on the bids for these units, 
&gt; people are under the false assumption that you have a pay a high 
&gt; price to get your hands on a limited resource, when that simply is 
&gt; not the case.)I can see nothing but positive benefits coming from 
&gt; educating people about their options.Margaret--- In EVP-

&gt; &gt; Hi Everyone,&gt; &gt; I have been reading the back and forth posts about 
&gt; ideas on how to &gt; deal with the individual selling the hacks on ebay 
&gt; for inflated &gt; prices.&gt; &gt; I posted my thoughts on that individual 
&gt; yesterday. I would now like &gt; to render my opinion as to the subject 
&gt; of what we or anyone can do &gt; about it.&gt; &gt; My suggestion is DO 
&gt; NOTHING! Now before everybody&#x27;s jaw hits the &gt; floor, hear me out.&gt; 
&gt; &gt; A couple of months ago I would have been the one to lead the 
&gt; charge &gt; in the assault on this guy in the name of box justice.&gt; &gt; I 
&gt; can now say with confidence, That is not the way to handle it.&gt; Let 
&gt; me explain why I believe this way. Without going into a lot of &gt; 
&gt; detail, I was a tough street kid that grew up on the streets of &gt; 
&gt; Brooklyn, I also served my country proudly for six years as a us 
&gt; army &gt; green beret, then to a career as a FDNY Fireman whose heart 
&gt; and &gt; health where both broken at 911.&gt; &gt; My point is, I have always 
&gt; lived my life believing that anything I &gt; did not agree with or that 
&gt; did not fit my sense of right and wrong&gt; whether it be right or 
&gt; wrong, could be easily solved with aggression &gt; of some kind.&gt; &gt; It 
&gt; took a long while and much sole searching and a lot of &gt; 
&gt; communication interpretation from our friends on the other side.&gt; 
&gt; But I have come to learn that aggressive action in any form is &gt; 
&gt; detrimental to the harmony and peace of the whole involved.&gt; &gt; Guy&#x27;s 
&gt; like this guy on ebay do not and can not last in the face of &gt; good 
&gt; and well intentioned people that are here and willing and trying &gt; 
&gt; to get the word of this miraculous research and spirit communication 
&gt; &gt; out to as many people as are in need or want of it.&gt; &gt; That is how 
&gt; we can stop people like this bottom feeder. By spreading &gt; the 
&gt; knowledge of this research from one person to the next. Our &gt; 
&gt; friends have stated time and time again that any negative energy 
&gt; will &gt; be detrimental to the communication and the research, and 
&gt; positive &gt; harmony and vibration will serve to strengthen the bridge 
&gt; between our &gt; worlds.&gt; &gt; So even if you are not religious and do not 
&gt; believe in Jesus Christ &gt; as I do, these words ring true no matter 
&gt; what context they come from&gt; this wisdom was spoken by my lord two 
&gt; thousand years ago.&gt; &gt; &quot;do not check the splinter in your brothers 
&gt; eye, until you have &gt; checked the plank in your own&quot;&gt; &gt; Truthfully, 
&gt; anything we could do to sway this individuals sale of &gt; these boxes 
&gt; would be minimal. Negativity and greed always find a &gt; crack to seep 
&gt; through.&gt; &gt; My suggestion is lets try a little harder to spread the 
&gt; word of the &gt; research and educate individuals that are or may 
&gt; become interested, &gt; through all the various outlets available to us 
&gt; on the web concerning &gt; the paranormal research community. There are 
&gt; endless chat boards, &gt; groups and forums plus websites and word of 
&gt; mouth. &gt; Instead of trying to stop this idiot from defrauding 
&gt; innocent &gt; unknowledgable people. Lets make sure the knowledge is 
&gt; out there for &gt; them and we are here to help them and guy&#x27;s like Mr. 
&gt; ebay will &gt; disappear on their own.&gt; &gt; And we will not have expended 
&gt; an ounce of negative energy in the &gt; process.&gt; That&#x27;s how I feel, 
&gt; but that&#x27;s just me.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt;
