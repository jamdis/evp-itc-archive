I does \n&gt; have a cadence similar to someone  speaking, but it could just as easily \nbe \n&gt; something present in the  environment-&lt;WBR&gt;a natural background noise. \nThere is \n&gt; no  way for me to tell for certain as it is just too feint. I can&#39;t make \n&gt;  out any clear words. Sure-I could probably matrix some in, but that is \nall it  \n&gt; would be. For an EVP to be considered proof positive of spirit  \n&gt; communication by the community at large, it has to be clear enough  that \nmany people \n&gt; hear the same thing, without hints or coaxing. If  you have to have high \n&gt; quality devices to make it out, it just isn&#39;t  good enough. That does not \nmean it \n&gt; isn&#39;t a true EVP, just that it  isn&#39;t good enough to stand as evidence. \nAs \n&gt; for the whistle, it  sounded like feedback to me as well, but I will have \nto \n&gt; take you word  for it that you were no where near any other electronics \nor \n&gt; EMF&#39;s  that could contribute to feedback. Even so, if I am trying to \nremain \n&gt;  unbiased and objective, there is no way for me to say this is a spirit,  \n&gt; without personally being with you when you caught it. The only thing  I \ncan \n&gt; still say about it is could be, but for me it is non  conclusive. If \nsomeone \n&gt; does not hear what you are hearing, try to  remain objective and just \n&gt; understand that it isn&#39;t personal. You have  to understand that with just \nthese \n&gt; recordings alone, there is no way  to scientifically prove what you have \n&gt; recorded is spirit  communication. If you could get consistent, \nintelligent \n&gt; question and  answer recordings, then you would be alot closer. Here \nagain, we are \n&gt;  back to the &quot;So what?&quot; thing.

The labels you give can influence \nthe \n&gt; listeners: when  you have a sound that could be several things, and you \nnote \n&gt; that it  sounded like &quot;keep it moving&quot;, the listener can find it nearly \n&gt;  impossible to try NOT to hear what you heard, and so not be able to give \na  \n&gt; fresh perspecive to help your research methods. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In  _EVP-ITC@yahoogroup --- In\n&gt; (mailto:_EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) ) ,  \n&quot;James W.

For an EVP to be consider=\r\ned proof positive of spirit \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; communication by the community at l=\r\narge, it has to be clear enough \n  that many people &lt;BR&gt;&gt; hear the same =\r\nthing, without hints or coaxing. If \n  you have to have high &lt;BR&gt;&gt; quali=\r\nty devices to make it out, it just isn&#39;t \n  good enough.

The only thing \n  I can =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; still say about it is could be, but for me it is non \n  conclusive=\r\n. If someone &lt;BR&gt;&gt; does not hear what you are hearing, try to \n  remain =\r\nobjective and just &lt;BR&gt;&gt; understand that it isn&#39;t personal.
