Rather than risk the scanner and the bending required, I thought about usi=
ng my camera.

I tried taking a single page at a time but even in Macro mod=
e, the type was out of focus.

So I just uploaded 4 pages (2 pages per imag=
e) of my first attempt with the camera.

I wanted to know if it was good en=
ough.=A0 If so, I'll redo those and the remaining pages with brighter light=
 and keeping my thumb out of the picture :))

If if it not good enough then=
 I'll try the scanner.=A0 Although I was able to read them just fine so it =
should be good enough.

Let me know,

Don

I have one of a handful of the Edison Autobiography that ha=

I suppose ultimately, it doesn't really matter if Edison made a

have to st=
and on their own results anyway, and if they've managed to
discover somethi=

I have also heard varied cla=
ims: that Edison did make this box; that
Edison was working on it but never=
 finished it; that Edison was joking
when he mentioned working on it. So fo=
r my own sake, I'd like to know
the real story.

If you have a link to wher=
e you got your information from his
assistants and staff, I would really li=
ke to read it. Please make
sure it is as close to the source material as po=
ssible, and not
someone quoting someone quoting an article. For example, he=

That is the ki=
