&gt;&gt; Nathan,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I suggest you read the headline and description of this group.
&gt;&gt; We are a group of real time communication researchers that are
&gt;&gt; continously seeking the truth. The founder of this board
&gt;&gt; Mr. Frank Sumption has alway&#x27;s made it clear that It is not a place
&gt;&gt; for sceptics and they will not be tolerated. We are here to study and
&gt;&gt; further real time soirit communication, not have to defend every post
&gt;&gt; we make or file we add. I suggest you take your negative accusations
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; detrimental unfounded criticism and scepticism somewhere else.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You are wearing your welcome thin here, not to mention within 5 posts
&gt;&gt; you have contradicted yourself three times. and went from the
&gt; philosophy
&gt;&gt; of aliens enslaving human spirits to questioning any chance that
&gt; this method
&gt;&gt; of spirit communication could or does exist and is a conspiricy to
&gt; fool unsuspecting
&gt;&gt; people like us by means of a super transmitter.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have learned by experience to try and keep this type of post
&gt; civil, So for any moderators that are reading this
&gt;&gt; Please review the situation.

&gt;&gt; Nathan, I am amazed you would suggest or even think that!  I live in
&gt; Cary, North Carolina and record when I have the time. There is no set
&gt; schedule, and when I turn my radio on and someone says hello Michael,
&gt; or even shouts out &quot;Mike Edwards&quot;, or a spirit tells me I am holding a
&gt; carving in my hand, who would even know I turned the radio on? Only my
&gt; wife knows I record, and we have kept this research from our children
&gt; as well as our neighbors. So you are suggesting that Margaret, lets
&gt; say who lives where I do not know, is playing a joke on me with a high
&gt; tech two way radio?

&gt;&gt; Hi Nathan. I always look to relevance as a key in determining
&gt; whether or not something is appropriate to the session. If this were a
&gt; hoax, I would then have to seek an explanation for how private
&gt; information is known by the &#x27;hoax perp&#x27;, particularly information that
&gt; would require visual awareness. Some of us have examples of
&gt; appropriate responses being given when asking things like, &quot;Can you
&gt; name something nearby me?&quot; or &quot;Please tell me what I&#x27;m holding in my
&gt; left hand.&quot; A sophisticated multi-transmission two way radio would not
&gt; explain answers which require &#x27;visual&#x27; information of some kind
&gt; (though I&#x27;ll be the first to admit my understanding of electronics is
&gt; limited but I&#x27;m fairly confident on this aspect.) Of course, there is
&gt; always the chance that the person running the hoax is also, or in
&gt; partnership with, an extremely talented remote viewer or psychic who
&gt; is able to glean that visual information from the ether or the mind of
&gt; the experimenter. And what of those examples where people have
&gt; confirmed the sound of the voice being &quot;just like&quot; that of their loved
&gt; one in spirit? Surely the hoaxer isn&#x27;t also able to mimic people&#x27;s
&gt; loved ones.If you are using EVP Maker with anything other than the
&gt; allophones file, which contains no words to begin with, you are also
&gt; running the possibility of &#x27;false positives&#x27; albeit they wouldn&#x27;t be
&gt; from a hoax. Again, I look to relevance to be key, and relevant info
&gt; that would not come easily to a stranger is even better. For example,
&gt; I turned on my MiniBox for the very first time and said, &quot;Hello?&quot; and
&gt; immediately received the response, &quot;Hello Margaret.&quot; If this were a
&gt; hoax, how could that person know in less than 10 seconds, who I was by
&gt; name. I had not given this information out. Not to mention that you
&gt; have people experimenting 24/7 and receiving similar responses. How in
&gt; the world could an organization have the manpower, technology, or even
&gt; the desire, to attempt such a hoax? I mean that as a genuine inquiry,
&gt; because there might be an explanation I have not thought of. I have
&gt; one example where, via radio sweep, my communicator was able to
&gt; correctly identify the status and location of a missing person (who it
&gt; turns out was alive and well, so we ended up with confirmation that
&gt; the info given had indeed been correct - which is much less
&gt; complicated that trying to track and understand the clues when
&gt; associated with the dead, or missing but not found.) Again, if a hoax,
&gt; would that have simply been a lucky guess on the part of the
&gt; hoaxer?Bottom line for me is ... have I wondered if it could be a
&gt; hoax? Or simply a fortuitous tuning of the dial? Yes, on both
&gt; accounts. But there is enough compelling evidence to rule out both of
&gt; them as an explanation for the far too many relevant examples received
&gt; by so many of us.Good food for thought, but after digesting it, I&#x27;d
&gt; have to say, &quot;No, a sophisticated hoax does not sufficiently explain
&gt; the phenomena on a large scale.&quot;Margaret--- In
