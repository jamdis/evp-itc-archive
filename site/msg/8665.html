  This is probably a stupid question, what type of program can I use to open this file?
   
  Thanks

The frequency display is now useless, so it's face down, and the power and band buttons will be added to a new front panel. I'm not sure if I want to make this direct out, or make it just like any other box. The audio should be more better than anything I've done so for, at least it sounded real good when I was using a manual control, but only could tune half the AM or FM bands wihtout the negative tuning voltage component. 
 
 The radio playing in the background is just C2C on a regular radio.
