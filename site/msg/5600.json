We are the longest residents to remain in the house and \nit surprises even some former residents who stopped by on New Year&#39;s \nday and confirmed a lot of what we&#39;ve experinced in the house, \nincluding the black robed figure in the bedrooms.\n\nI&#39;ve never done the pipe ceremony, I do meditation and stuff with \nchrystals and stones. \nIt&#39;s just very cool to finally get some EVP from the house :) \nnext up is a digital camera....any advice from the tech arena as to \nwhich cheap camera is good to take pictures?\n\nSaqqara\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Ya don&#39;t have to go anywhere &quot;haunted&quot; to get spirit contacts, they \n&gt; will come to you. I have not done an investigation yet, I went to one \n&gt; of Chris Moon&#39;s GHUs to observe once, and went to the Stanley to see \n&gt; the new Mini box, but not to investigate. Not only that, I don&#39;t ask \n&gt; questions (or rarely ask questions), nor ask for any certain \n&gt; individuals. I used to protection stuff, particuallt Native Amnerican \n&gt; type pipe ceramony, but they convinced me to stop smoking, and I \nwon&#39;t \n&gt; even touch the pipe for fear of the tabaco hook. So I just don&#39;t do \nany \n&gt; of that stuff, and it doesn&#39;t seem to matter. \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
