Some members commented I should not take that route as it may offend the loved one contacted.  But I have some methods planned to try and help ensure no one is offended. \n   \n  I have a few spirits that want to contact their loved ones, but getting the key info is a problem.\n   \n  I have tested several methods to try and get it, but due to the 12-469 on am clicking noise, and several spirits talking at the same time, the info, and confirmation of info is not coming through clear enough.\n   \n  I tried a new method today where i asked each spirit in the room to to take turns. One would hold my hand, and say their name, and then I would ask for info about the spirit for my spirit profile. When done I would go to the next, and so on. \n   \n  I have heard many of you talk about evp maker. I downloaded that today. In a nutshell, will that program help me get better responses?\n   \n  Switching to another type of box, may be the answer too. Please advise\n   \n  There has to be a way to get first and last name, city and state and country of the spirit and the same of the loved one. Having this info will allow me to do research on the internet, white pages, etc. An then there is the confirmation of the info gathered that has to be done, by the spirit, and once all gathered, then I have to make the final decision whether to attempt contact and how to do that without hurting anyone. \n   \n  Any advice on how to get the info from them, and what radio or tool I can use with my existing radio that would help me move forward will be much appreciated.\n   \n  To all of you what methods of gathering info have proven best for each of you, and to the more experienced members, to do what I want to do, what upgrades do I need to make from my 12-469 to get better results?\n   \n  Without each of you I would be lost, and look forward to your comments and guidance\n   \n   \n\n\nMichael Edwards:  f1cracker75@...\n        \r\n--0-840951033-1208192628=:42460\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Members, I need your help.&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;As I believe I already mentioned to some of you and&nbsp;perhaps all other members, I have taken my research to try and help spirits to make contact their loved ones.
