I decided to look up old recordings of the man to see what does he sound like as a live person. I didnt find much but I did manage to download one recording of harvey firestone introducing him and saying it was the first time he allowed his voice to be recorded. It was done in early 1900's.The stranger thing is the first words out of his mouth were the same as the evp "this is edison speaking"
   
  I made a little side by side comparison and tho it doesnt sound exact it is remarkably similar to his voice in the rest of the recording. Id upload that but its too big for an attachment. If anyone wants the link to download the whole thing http://cylindersontheweb.angelcities.com/rare_recordings.htm look for the "firestone" one from 1919 14 THOMAS EDISON introduced by HARVEY FIRESTONE - Let Us Not Forget 
   
  Heres the side by side of his voice and my evp for anyone whos curious.

          Just as an aside, Misty--I've heard recordings of Edison's voice and this struck me right away as a very similar one. Each time I listen to it, I feel more strongly that it could be him.   

  The third recording "We have conscious..." is equally as amazing.
  

  Wonderful stuff!
