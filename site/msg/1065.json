If the flame is set too high the unit \n&gt;generates lots of noise from the flutter of the flame. Also the room should \n&gt;be dark and computer monitor turned down to reduce noise the mic will pick \n&gt;up produced stray light sources.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMortgage refinance is Hot. *Terms.
