<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, sadly they found the second lost little boy today, his body was 
around  3/4 mile from home, no other details, they have moved the other 
case for Syler up to criminal investigation.  Have no other information 
on this yet.

Subject: [inside_the_box_rtsc_ghost_box_research] Another mising child 
in AZ,

 
There is another two year old boy that has gone missing in AZ, why not 
lets ask spirit about this, this child lives about 1.5 hours from the 
Syler boy, who is now a criminal investigation, it looks like they 
ignored the name of the man that spirit said took him, oh well.  It may 
be the same guy in both cases, they are now looking into local child 
molesters lists.  This other little kid, was missing, his dog came 
back, but it looked like someone picked him up too. sf</pre>
