I'm not saying it is you, but it is deep and gravelly like your voice.

Be =
careful of assigning any type of class to different voice types. Just becau=
se a voice might sound low and growly does not mean it is a lower life form=
. If we hear a spirit voice that sounds week and feint, we think the spirit=
 is in pain or trouble. But that isn't necessarily the case. It could be th=
at is all it could do at the moment due to any number of inhibiting factors=
.. Breaking the dimensional barrier is probably not easy.

Just like for us=
 living. You have a deep and resonant voice. That doesn't say much for your=
 class or personality, it is just the way your body was made. It wouldn't b=
e right for me to think you were of a lower or higher stature than me becau=
se of the sound of your voice.

Also, a voice may take on a different tone =
depending on how it is being transmitted.

People also like to make stateme=
nts about the color a spirit may appear in. Those assessment though are mad=
e in human ignorance. For instance, if a ghost appears black, out of the ba=
ggage we humans have attached to that color, we automatically assign and ev=
il label to it. But that isn't a proper assumption. It is our own inability=
 to remain objective. We see a color and we get an instant motor response. =
Those responses are human in nature and imposed upon us by other's beliefs =
or other environmental factors.

Bottom line is when it comes to this stuff=
, you cannot assess anything based on beliefs. "Just the facts maam..."

Yo=
u have to got by the spirits actions to tell what their demeanor is. Even t=
hen, a spirit's action can be misunderstood. Say a spirit has just thrown a=
n object in your direction. We may automatically think of that as an aggres=
sive attack. But the spirit is probably just trying to get your attention i=
n the most obvious way possible. It didn't throw the thing at you to hurt y=
ou.

See what I'm saying? The only way you can really tell a spirits demean=
or is by studying that same entity for a period of time to see what the nat=
ure of its actions are.
