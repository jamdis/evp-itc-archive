Where did I say it was impossible? All I said was given the experiments tri=
ed, we've had no success, which is not judgmental: it is simply true.

Peop=
le ask me to do some work here. I organized experiments, listened to claims=
, and tried to collect objective data.=C2=A0 Then I asked asked for comment=
s on improving the 
experiments.=C2=A0 How is that making you perform like =
a 'puppet'?

You seem to be making up a lot of accusations that you can not=
 demonstrate are true.=C2=A0 Why?=C2=A0
