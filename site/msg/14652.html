Well, if this leads to fighting, I'm sure Spirit will stop talking to us  
altogether, I tried to call Bill's machine, but I couldn't hear much of  
anything, maybe sound was too low, or maybe someone was hearing what I should  
have been hearing, I'm sure they heard me, but someone on the other end was  
reaping the rewards of my one sided conversation, I'm sure.  Left me very  
unhappy, (p...is..ed o..f). , I sure wish people could make this work for all 
of  us though, and give credit where credit is due, Edison told me, he was 
working  with a certain couple of people, poor guy, he's running all over 
the place, when  people keep asking for his help, he has to stop what he's 
doing to inspire one  person, then has to run over to see what all the 
hollering is all about with  someone else.  Don't forget, none of this would be 
possible were it not  given to us by the Man upstairs, and no one gives Him any 
credit, it's not  "religion."  It's called life.

Yeah, I think a lot of pretenders do try to find ways  to promote 
themselves into more credibility.  In fact, I wonder  about that project you are 
going to be doing with Mr Moon.  It's  my guess he is the one who suggested it 
(maybe even dropped some  profitability hints?).  Realize, his method of 
performing medium  with the box, and charging the vulnerable large amounts of 
money, is  under attack from many quarters, and he has begun to go on the  
defensive.  One thing that is hard for him to defend, is how he  can be so 
expert with the box when he had nothing to do with its  construction.

Now consider, if he can get the box's maker to  participate in a project 
together, even just once, he can add to his  list of credentials things such 
as "Worked together with the original  box's designer, Frank Sumption, on new 
designs." Or even "Co-creater  of the new Box", whatever it is.

You will be giving him that  very credibility, that those "do my shows" are 
looking for.   Maybe even getting him new customers.  Just by associating 
with  him on one project.

My advice is, be careful that you aren't  just being used for your 
credentials Frank.

Yeah, real interesting, if ya know something about these  various "players" 
in the field. Yet they wonder why I don't play  those "do my show" games. A 
certain amount here left unsaid, so not  too many will get it.
