I addressed this guy in a session at home on November 3rd when he popped up
again.  In this clip (unadulterated so its a little fast), I get a clear
response from my tech as to who it is, another freak message from him, and a
singing tonal response from others.

&gt; Tim,
&gt;
&gt; I think he&#x27;s been hanging out during our recordings lately too, lol.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ve been called a &quot;freak&quot; in at least half a dozen sessions I&#x27;ve held over
&gt; the last 2-3 weeks. I also heard and recognized &quot;Pete&quot; from your recording.
&gt;
&gt; Nice files and thanks for sharing!

&gt; I was at Rolling Hills with Frank that night.  Here are a few I recorded
&gt; with him during a different session.  In one of the clips you will hear
&gt; someone from the other side call me a freak.  I picked this guy up over a
&gt; month ago and he likes to hang around and call me freak whenever I do a
&gt; session.  I find it pretty funny because he is so consistent; during this
&gt; session he called me freak multiple times.
