I&#39;ve about had it with Hi-8 or Digital-8 tape drives that break \ndown and cost a fortune to repair if they do.\n\nZack\n\nOn Fri, 21 Sep 2007, HKaczmarek wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi!\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m new to the group. I was doing ITC looped through the TV until my camcorder broke. Now I am saving for a new one. Digital this time! Anyway, I thought the pictures were just wonderful and I would be excited about them too!! I am also curious what you are doing to get such clear photos. I have gotten &quot;scenes&quot;, faces, silhouettes, etc. Nothing that clear.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have also used running water too for ITC with good results.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am very curious about how you are set up!\n&gt;\n&gt; Heather\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  I have to agree with you on this one.  That is pretty impressive.  What configuration are you using.  I have done some video work using the continuous loop idea of recording the television screen showing the same television screen that I was recording, if that makes any sense.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Lynn\n&gt;\n&gt;  Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;    A face of woman in a black background. Now this one impresses even me.\n&gt;\n&gt;     It&#39;s a bit frustrating to be excited all to hell about something and nobody cares!\n&gt;\n&gt;     Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;    More photos; more messages; more whatever - Get MORE with Windows LiveT Hotmailï¿½.
