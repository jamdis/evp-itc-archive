Just want to thank Bruce, Margaret and Stefan for taking time to listen and comment.  I will go back to the drawing board and reprogram my evpmaker and my brain.  Will give it another go.  
   
  Couple comments regarding your comments.  One, I have had limited experience recording traditional evps and have been able to hear and recognize messages.  I can also hear about 80 percent of the messages posted here by others...true the written description makes it vastly more easy to do so.  I recognize that I need a lot of practice deciphering my own session and I intend to do that.    Like Bruce and a few others here, I feel very positive about using evpmr  with stefan's enhancements and due to my signal problems with radio it is the only thing I will focus on for now.    Thanks again for making time for me.  Ron L

          Hi Ron. Your example doesn't sound anything like that of my session, or the sessions of 
others I've heard. I'll be interested in hearing what you get with the new download of the 
72 allophones file (there definitely should not be a beep in there) and double check to 
make sure you've selected the CUE option.

I agree with Stephan, that it takes some getting used to the sound (by the way, turn the 
volume of the recording down, which will have prevent the distortion that is present in 
your current example.) I also agree that having experience in traditional EVP work helps, 
and I, too, recommend that people (not saying this is your case, I don't know what your 
experience is) should gain a foundation in traditional EVP work, prior to jumping into 
sweep/box/EVPM research. Though clearly, it isn't necessary to do so in order to obtain 
good results with these methods. :0)
