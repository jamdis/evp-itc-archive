I lost the website that I can buy a Mini Boxe from Ron.  Will somebody post it in the forum for me? 
   
  Thanks

I am curious to see how the mini and Frank's compare. I feel that the
my minibox is a bit like a TARDIS in a way--I hate to say it has
bonded with me or imprinted on me (or I've imprinted on it), but that
does seem to describe it. The entities operating through it have bent
their communication style to my circumstances. I will be curious to
see if 31 does something similar. Who knows? It may decide it likes my
son Nick over me, or my friend Julie.

Whatever happens, I shall enjoy the experience!
