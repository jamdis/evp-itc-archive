show... :)

I&#x27;m going to start posting a few things about Alec&#x27;s work with the 
Alpha Interface Unit he developed.

Here&#x27;s an article from Fate magazine (July 1, 2000):

&quot;The Alpha Mystery&quot; by Jose Feola

Plus I&#x27;m adding 2 papers Alec has written about EVP and the Alpha 
Unit (particularly of importance is the capturing of EVP in a 
soundproof Faraday cage):

&quot;A Bio-electromagnetic Device of Unusual Properties&quot; (published in 
the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research)

http://www.skyelab.co.uk/review/aa.htm

&quot;Report of an Anomalous Speech Products Experiment inside a Double 
Screened Room&quot;

http://www.skyelab.co.uk/review/bb.htm

You can also buy Alec&#x27;s book and EVP sampler CD online:

Next time - I&#x27;ll post about Alec&#x27;s funded EVP research project 
called &quot;The Intelligence Project&quot; along with charts and the samples 
that the international listening panel (which I was a member of) 
judged. Hopefully - he&#x27;ll be sending me both the interim report and 
final report so I can put them in the &quot;Files&quot; area.
