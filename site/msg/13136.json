I am not on here much as I\nusually just read the posts and contribute when I can. I am very busy\nwith my group so balancing my time isn&#39;t easy.\n\nI guess as of now it is hard to say whether or not an EVP is from a\n&quot;living&quot; entity or just a sound bit floating in time. All we can do is\nspeculate on such matters, really. I think that time may lead to\nfinite answers to our questions, but as it stands with our limited\nequipment and devices we use to measure phenomenon, we cannot say 100%\nfor certain. I have my theories, as does everyone.\n\nThat being said, my personal belief is that EVP and ITC can be both.\nThough my research has been much more focused on EVP and recently, on\nthe Radio Shack hack box, I have seen what I believe to be evidence of\nboth. I have many EVPs recorded that seem to suggest both &quot;living&quot;\nentities and those that suggest residual phenomenon, or &quot;residue&quot; of\nthings in the past.\n\nOne example is the EVP I captured at the Camp Creek Trustle in\nMcDonough, GA. In the EVP, the voice picked up seems to suggest that\nhe is not dead. Tou can check this file out in my folder here. Also,\nat the investigation of the trustle, EVPs were picked up seeming to\nanswer questions. For example, when I asked what kind of music was\nenjoyed by the entity, I received &quot;orcha&quot; as an response. I took this\nto be an attempt to say &quot;orchestra,&quot; a popular music choice from the\nearly 1900&#39;s when so many lives were lost at this spot. As for the\nRadio Shack hack, just last night I was again at the trustle\nconducting a hack box session. When we asked about which of us were in\nattendance, the answer came back very clearly with two of our names,\n&quot;Nate&quot; and &quot;Chad.&quot; These were very clear and in an area where radio\nreception is not that great.\n\nPerhaps one of our more compelling EVPs as they relate to whether or\nnot these are &quot;living&quot; entities we are communicating with is one that\nwe recorded in the White House located in McDonough, GA. A team member\nwas talking about someone and how poorly they kept up their yard when\nwe picked up a very clear voice saying &quot;You are so mean.&quot; On the same\ninvestigation we captured a voice talking about Kurt, another\ninvestigator and how he was stupid.\n\nNow to the other side of the coin. We have picked up &quot;EVPs&quot; of things\nsuch as gunshots and cannon fire at civil war battlefields we have\nvisited. These appear at first to be residual sounds, yet other\naspects of the investigation seem to provide proof of intelligent\nentities. Perhaps the soldiers who died in that battle are still\nfighting. We cannot really say based on only the EVPs taken during\nthose investigations. We do have other evidence, but I will not go\ninto that here as this is an EVP/ITC group.\n\nFeel free to take a look at our group&#39;s site.\nwww.georgiastateparanormal.com\n\nI am happy to send our files to anyone for research purposes if requested.\n\nI am sure that many of the members of the group will give you their\ntheories as well on this matter, and I&#39;m sure that as you begin to\nexperiment on your own that many fascinating and unexplained events\nwill present themselves to you. Good luck, and again, welcome to the\ngroup.\n\nChad"}
