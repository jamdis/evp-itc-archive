I do with a cell phone. I think you'd have to be there to judge it. 

Personally I'm always disappointed at my stuff being out there, and 
the incredible lack of clarity obatained with it, to me that's a huge 
failure! I know the stuff works, but how to get it to a level that can 
be understood by most, that's the problem, and my focus at the moment. 
The Mini Box is big step in that direction, so some of the pressure if 
off, but I still need to get my boxes to professional level.
