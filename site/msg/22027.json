The dr&#39;s give me \nabout a year and that was back in May. I&#39;m ok with it but all my funds - \nand future funds - are going to my final arrangements and affairs. I \nwant everything completed before hand :-)\n\nPlease don&#39;t think me crass but I have an appeal. I want to do a video \njournal of what is going on. I want to continue this in and out of the \nhospital and ultimately, to the end. Someone will manage the camera \nafter that until after all is complete. My friend Mimi Burns has offered \nher acoustic version of her Irish band for a wake :-)\n\nSometimes writing comes hard since they changed my meds. This is one \nreason why I gave up the short stories. My appeal to all of you is, is \nthere anyone who could let me have or lend me an ir video cam to \naccomplish my goal? I can try to work out some payment arraingment with \nthose who want compensated. My pc is old so it would have to be one \nwhere I can upload vie usb or memory chip. There are so many expenses \ngoing on in my life right now that I can barely keep up with rent. \nPassing is an expensive task!\n\nI&#39;m trying to keep as positive as possible but it gets hard. I seldom \nhit FB anymore. The ir is because many times I do things in the dark and \nmy place is haunted. There are spirits floating around everywhere here!\n\nOk, that&#39;s it. Hope I don&#39;t lose any friends over this.\n\nYour friend,\n\nMick\n\n\n-- \nhttp://www.facebook.com/micksghosts"}
