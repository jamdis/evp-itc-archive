The paranormal field is truly a circus of ego and\nprofiteering. Not many folks give a damn about helping or elevating\ntheir fellow researcher.

It&#39;s too bad so many are willing to  \n&gt; pay and follow such egomaniacs when, as Frank S. said, anyone can  \n&gt; spend a few bucks at Radio Shack and record with no prior experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps people should start boycotting these self proclaimed experts.  \n&gt; If no one shows up or gives them money, they&#39;ll just disappear  \n&gt; eventually. They will eventually disappear anyway as once people  \n&gt; actually start researching on their own, they&#39;ll see right through  \n&gt; these people.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone can record. It&#39;s easy. No training required. As for the boxes,  \n&gt; Franks sent me maybe 2 emails of maybe 3 sentences of how to fiddle  \n&gt; with the knobs. I figured the rest out and my goodness, NO CHARGE!\n&gt; \n&gt; w\n&gt; ‡•ê\n&gt; \n&gt; On Oct 9, 2008, at 1:49 PM, threadsintyme@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t laugh at this idea!
