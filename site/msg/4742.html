<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey, Misty at least people are responding to your audio files.  I 
haven&#x27;t had any feedback on my posts in months.  Being that this 
board has nothing to do with ITC research anymore and more about 
appliances that are broken.  People are probably wondering why 
occasionally some are posting audio files, maybe we are wrong for 
imposing on their chat room.  I have a toaster on the fritz so maybe 
i can join in on the chat now.

&gt;   Happy New Year to you too! Thanks for tryin but sometimes its 
just not for everyone ears. Never know who hears what til ya post it 
=) I dont worry about quality so much anymore because whats crystal 
clear for some sounds like blahbedeblah to others.

&gt;           Misty,
&gt;  
&gt; Happy new year, I listened to the files a few times and unless you 
read 
&gt; what they are labeled I could not hear anything but misty in the 
second one
&gt; I don&#x27;t think it was quality just volume of the voice itself.

&gt;       I don&#x27;t know if maybe the audio pick up from the box wasn&#x27;t 
very good, 
&gt; but I can&#x27;t make out much of that either. It sounds like the 
recordings 
&gt; I do with a cell phone. I think you&#x27;d have to be there to judge it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Personally I&#x27;m always disappointed at my stuff being out there, and 
&gt; the incredible lack of clarity obatained with it, to me that&#x27;s a 
huge 
&gt; failure! I know the stuff works, but how to get it to a level that 
can 
&gt; be understood by most, that&#x27;s the problem, and my focus at the 
moment. 
&gt; The Mini Box is big step in that direction, so some of the pressure 
if 
&gt; off, but I still need to get my boxes to professional level.
