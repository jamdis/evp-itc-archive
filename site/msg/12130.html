I dont think thier comment was directed at you Stephen tho I know some of your wonderings matches others. 

As to who or what they are, again I think the label applues to whom you ask more than anything. When spirit is asked the answer varies from angel, to ghost, to energy, to echo, to purples, to dead people. A few references usually match likeminded with the person they are communicating with. I tend to be very open minded so I have had all those answers and then some. 

Personally I can only attest to the fact that I have had "people" I knew come thru in thier own voices with info that was later verified by outside sources. My first evp was of my mothers voice and it was quite unexpected. She had been passed for quite a long time. I never really went hunting for ghosts they tend to hunt for me instead.

In the end everyone will believe what they want to believe. I dont seek to change that. I dont seek to prove anything to anyone they ned to do that for themselves. In the meantime everyone can help each other and use a little tact when speaking to the energies around you whether living or dead, respect goes both ways. I see no reason for the hostility that is underlying in this field, or the jealousy as someone put it =) You are all adults (well most of you anyway) and whether you have been at this 20 years or two days I think that working together is more fruitful than working against each other.
