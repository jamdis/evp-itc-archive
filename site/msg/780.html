i dont think so, in most cases. If you remember the messages u n me sent back n forth ? that CHANGED as they went through the email. So, its not you. The messages are heard and then changed for another reason. I think its alot like the multi-layer messages.

 wanted open. I tried that a few times, and it made no difference. It turns 
 out that if I leave the front panel of the receiver open, the feedback 
 between the echo box mic, and the monitor speaker is almost eliminated. On 
 one of the mini boxes I drilled 3/8 holes in the cover to cut out feedback, 
 in a recent system I raised the front panel on 1/2" stand offs and that 
 works. So I do get some guidence from the "guys", I just don't understand 
 it.......most of the time!! Curiously, when I first got that message I heard 
 "Frank has a girl friend", which was false, then it seemingly changed to 
 "leave the box open" both having the same amount of syllables. That was back 
 in 2003. It really makes one question one's hearing!
