YES!

 

We have had cell phones set off our EMF meters.

What made me ban=
 the use of two way radios was when I noticed that they were causing interf=
erence on the DVRs..

they also cause humming and static on some audio reco=
rders - as do some cell phones.

 

 

For large aeas like Gettysburg, ffor=
t Mifflin, ESP, etc, what we do is map out the area ahead of time, with a s=
cheduled rotation of small groups. That way we know where everyone is at al=
l times. So far this has been successful for us. This method assumes a leve=
l of responsibility and respect on the part of the investigators - I have f=
ound that if you are doing an event where others and the public are invited=
 it is essential to have them see the schedule and agree to abide by it whe=
n they sign up and then again when they arrive.

Tom, 

 

I own a Motorola =
Razor. On a recent investigation I had my Razor set to vibrate. I recieved =
a phone call that set off the EMF detector and it subsequently "spiked" fro=
m the color green to red and did so for each vibra signal the the phone was=
 receiving... This false positive reading led me to make sure that everyone=
s phone was instead turned off entirely.

 

I have also recieved radio int=
erference or bleed over from other two-way radios in the area that can be c=
onfused as EVP if not mentioned when recording audio. Still, I find 2-way r=
adios convenient if not necessary for larger scale field investigations. I'=
m sure my colleagues in the Gettysburg area would agree with me ... but I a=
lso hear from my friend Bill Murphy that many have resorted to hand held GP=
S systems to mark particular areas of interest when conducting EVP or ITC s=
essions in the field...

That's interesting Laurie. How have you seen radios like that messing
u=
p equipment? What equipment do you think is susceptible to that kind
of rad=
io interference?
