&gt;       Now I hear this very different from the other day &quot;you are the key 
&gt;to this
&gt;  (Reversed) they&#x27;re coming to know&quot;. I don&#x27;t like attention, and 
&gt;definitely
&gt;  not the center of anyone&#x27;s attention!  Sounds like more all nighters to 
&gt;me!!
&gt;  I stayed up almost all night Monday so I could build yet another board,
&gt;  while I&#x27;m working I have these other ideas floating around in my head,
&gt;  waiting for a place to land. Like revisiting Spircom, and trying to apply
&gt;  what I know to it, thanks to Ryan! I think if I were to make a square 
&gt;wave
&gt;  audio generator, since a square wave contains all hamonics, randomly tune 
&gt;it
&gt;  to get that random function, then use that to modulate a simple 
&gt;transmtter,
&gt;  then receive that signal on a simple reciever a short distance away, 
&gt;maybe I
&gt;  can do something like Meek did. The transmitter/receiver can be made with
&gt;  mixer chips, like the SA602, and I have some in my junk box (a techy&#x27;s 
&gt;parts
&gt;  bins). Then the audio circuits are again just op amps, and I just got an
&gt;  order in.
&gt;
&gt;  I&#x27;ve often wondered about the possiblity of modulating a White Noise
&gt;  signal, then listening for a response on a White Noise based receiver, 
&gt;using
&gt;  White Noise instead of a local oscillator, yeah, using normal voice to
&gt;  modulate the noise. You could use crystal filters to narrow the 
&gt;transmission
&gt;  to a small RF spectrum, something easy, like around 10mhz, but I&#x27;m not 
&gt;sure
&gt;  if ultra sound might not be better, since there&#x27;s  some that claim that&#x27;s
&gt;  where the spirits hang out. We need an Edison set up, a room full of
&gt;  researchers testing ideas.
