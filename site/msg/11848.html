<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Al,

I refrain from associating religious myth with paranormal research. I  
respect people&#x27;s right to whatever beliefs they choose, but I also  
respect those who aren&#x27;t religious, but spiritual or whatever.

Having experienced &quot;death&quot; twice, I feel fairly secure in my  
experiences and would say you&#x27;re in for a big surprise. I wouldn&#x27;t  
call or refer to these energies as &quot;souls&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure where you get  
the idea or assume these energies are more than or &quot;above&quot; what you  
term a &quot;lowly entity&quot;. Making statements assuming everyone believes  
the same way or experienced the same things is not only without sense,  
but incredibly arrogant in my mind. We&#x27;re all in the same boat here.  
I&#x27;d rather hear people speak about their experiences, not tag comments  
with religious like dogma in an attempt to explain.

There are no experts in this research as Misty stated not long ago.  
We&#x27;re all learning, experiencing and floundering for answers. All I  
can share are my own experiences in the hope it will help others in  
their own research. That&#x27;s it.

The initial topic was the Fish Group. I&#x27;ll stick with that. Other than  
Frank, Erland, and a rare few others, I don&#x27;t know anyone else who has  
experienced the Fish Group. I did hear that the author of &quot;Moth Man&quot;  
recorded evp and he ran into what he termed a malevolent group that  
disgusted him so that he quit recording. I have to wonder if it was  
them.

&gt; Wisteria,

&gt; I forgot but you may be quite right! There are spirits who have  
&gt; never been incarnated into human form. They tend not to be involved  
&gt; in any way with lower forms of vibration.
&gt;
&gt; Edgar Cayce spoke of them. Their souls were created as the moment of  
&gt; Creation. They chose not to have ever incarnated. Since their  
&gt; vibration level is far more than a lowly entity, I highly doubt that  
&gt; they would interact with lower entities. They are on a completely  
&gt; different level of existence.
