&gt; Is your photos and audio so good that it&#x27;s worth fighting over?  Get your
&gt; new group going and start posting new stuff from that.  Forget about the
&gt; other stuff for now, you still have it on your computer if you want to
&gt; listen to it.
&gt;
&gt; Take it down and re-post it in 6 months when they forgotton about it.

&gt;&gt; I have a legal question that I cannot seem to find an answer to. I
&gt;&gt; recently
&gt;&gt; went on an investigation to a public place with a  paranormal group. While
&gt;&gt; my experience is much less than theirs, I found them to be too
&gt;&gt; disorganized.
&gt;&gt; Three people came from the group. One had no equipment and the second used
&gt;&gt; his cell phone. I never even saw a pencil. So, I started a small group,
&gt;&gt; specifically for amateur investigators staying in local public places so
&gt;&gt; we
&gt;&gt; don&#x27;t get in over our heads. We aren&#x27;t trying to get any resident
&gt;&gt; investigations and are non competitive. On our site I put photos and evps
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; had gotten while on the investigation and put at the bottom that some
&gt;&gt; evidence was obtained while on investigations with other groups. I didn&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; use any of their names. As with any of my photos, I blocked out any faces,
&gt;&gt; and it was all on my equipment. I signed nothing and agreed to nothing.
&gt;&gt; Yesterday he sent me an email saying he wants it taken down. It&#x27;s
&gt;&gt; technically and legally his ( technically and legally?). If I wanted to
&gt;&gt; start my own group all I had to do was ask. He has said that I invited a
&gt;&gt; 16
&gt;&gt; year old to join the group (Definitely didn&#x27;t). And that he thought I
&gt;&gt; would
&gt;&gt; join their group.
&gt;&gt; -I don&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s right on the legal issue. Ethically, I would have
&gt;&gt; accredited the group if he was more diplomatic and maybe even taken it
&gt;&gt; down.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; - wouldn&#x27;t making false accusations make him guilty of liable?
&gt;&gt; - I don&#x27;t need to ask him to do ****. I&#x27;ve met him twice.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Does anybody know of any place where I can find something written on the
&gt;&gt; law
&gt;&gt; about those photos and media being mine.
