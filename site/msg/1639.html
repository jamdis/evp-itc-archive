Hi To All
I have been listening to every posted file, and there are several=
 that are so distinct. This one is one of them! Very nice, very interesting=
, definatley something happening! I am fixin to get my own and start as wel=
l. I got to witness the box belonging to Bill Murphy at a Paranormal Meetup=
 group. This was the first time I had seen such a thing and to be honest at=
 first was a bit skeptical, even though I strongly believe and feel have co=
llected much credible evidence of paranormal activity for many years now. I=
 have come to conclude that I am extremely sensitive to energies as well as=
 extremely intuitive. The box has a definate energy about it. I continue to=
 read everything thats posted and listen in hope to grasp this whole concep=
t. I cant get it out of my mind. How amazing this form of EVP is. Good job =
to all, hopefully I will be able to contribute some time soon. You know yea=
rs ago my kids had Furbies (sp?), and they would just start talking out of =
no
 where and say very revelent things that I felt was strange at the time =
and out of context to anything my kids said....LOL, I wonder if there is an=
y connection. Maybe not but I never forget them, Frank's Box conjures up th=
e same energy to me.
