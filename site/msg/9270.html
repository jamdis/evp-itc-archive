Hi Frank,
 
Never go the idea that you were desperate for funds.  As well a=
s  everyone 
else here was willing to donate also never felt that way.  If =
it  offended you 
in any way I apologize.

Hi All; 
As I said before, I mistakenly supplied the 469 with 3  v=
olts( in my head 3 
betteries =3D3 volts-sleep deprived), instead of the 4.=
5  volts that would 
normally come from the batteries(3 X 1.5). Well, that'=
s  pretty close to 5 volts, so 
I just tweaked the regulator up to five vol=
ts, and  it(the 469) runs fine. So 
just a 78L05 will do to power the 469 o=
n the  sweep board. For those crazy 
enough to try this. 

BTW, I  guess I =
left the impression I was desperate for funds, that's not the 
case,  the o=
nly thing I really need is time! I just don't have the time to 
make boxes =
 non-stop. The Old' Lady will let me buy whatever I truly need, and 
this m=
onth  that will be circuit boards. I'm not going to to spend every spare 
p=
enny on  ghost boxes. 

I make a few boxes for special cases, such  as--sin=
ce day one "they" have 
talked about Chip Coffey, so he gets #34. Ann  and =
Misty have been waiting years, 
so I'm hoping to get thiers shipped this  w=
eek.  I did do one of my super 
hacks for someone, but it was almost by  in=
tuition that I found it acceptable, 
they supplied the 469. I can't do that=
  for many, again I just don't have the 
time. This is going to be a weird =
one,  it'll do a regular hack function, or it 
can be swithed to normal box=
 mode.  BTW, all these boxes are going to women, 
except for Coffey. Most o=
f the  boxes I've ever made were to test various 
ideas, then when I was do=
ne I just  gave them away to who ever I could pawn them 
off on, now it's a=
 different  story. They even say to give Moon more boxes, so 
the demands e=
ven come from  the spirits.

I'm hoping to set aside building by the end of=
  the week so I can focus on a 
printed circuit board design. I want like a=
  universal sweep/amplifier board. 
This last one I made over the weekend t=
ook  ten hours to wire by hand, I can 
eliminate that much labor by having =
some  boards made, since the sweep, and 
amplifiers are pretty much the sam=
e from  system to system. 

Frank-S
