It is often considered to be a form of clairvoyance. Clairaudience is essentially the ability to hear in a paranormal manner, as opposed to paranormal seeing (clairvoyance) and feeling (clairsentience). Clairaudient people have psi-mediated hearing. Clairaudience may refer not to actual perception of sound, but may instead indicate impressions of the &quot;inner mental ear&quot; similar to the way many people think words without having auditory impressions. But it may also refer to actual perception of sounds such as voices, tones, or noises which are not apparent to other humans or to recording equipment. For instance, a clairaudient person might claim to hear the voices or thoughts of the spirits of persons who are deceased. \n   \n  I have had this happen many many times. Mostly just before I am falling asleep (when the mind chatter starts to settle down). I don&#39;t feel what I am hearing is really spoken out loud but it is heard in my head. Hope that makes since. For any of you that meditate you know what I mean by this.\n   \n  Kay\n\n\n  __________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam? Yahoo!
