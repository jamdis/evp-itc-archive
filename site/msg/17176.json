I&#39;ve only used linear in my boxes and I&#39;ve gotten fantastic results. Frank would be the best to speak about the random mode, but from what I understand at least from what I&#39;ve heard and what I&#39;ve heard captured by Steve is that &quot;they&quot; seem to push/ask for the random mode. Maybe the random mode can be manipulated easier on their end. I&#39;d love to try the random mode but have no clue how/ or where to start. The ability to alter the rate of sweep is important too. Thinking of the 587 as an example, it sweeps so slow that it&#39;s easy to hear complete words which can sometimes be mistaken for actual communication. That doesn&#39;t mean that there isn&#39;t communication but the skeptics will beat you to death over it. The adjustable sweep rate allows you to set it so fast that it&#39;s almost impossible to pull any single words from the sweep as you listen. Im my experience, no matter how fast the sweep sweeps the\n&gt;  band the communication doesn&#39;t seem rushed, in fact it seems like they may be altering the sweep as needed to communicate clearly. Like I said, I&#39;m not an expert by any means and this is just what I think based on my work with the boxes I&#39;ve used. Hope this helps, I&#39;m sure Frank and Steve can add much more to this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chris\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: &quot;dc3644@...&quot; &lt;dc3644@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Tue, May 18, 2010 3:52:47 PM\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Sweeps\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; So when the radio is doing the sweep, is it important to have a random sweep or a linear? Does one work better than the other? Also is it important to be able to very the speed of the sweep?\n&gt; \n&gt; Dwayne Claud\n&gt; \n&gt; In a message dated 5/18/2010 12:34:05 P.M.

For the past couple years I&#39;ve been using\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mostly what I call direct mode, or no echo chamber. When I use an\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; aluminum\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; foil chamber I seem to get more ET types, and that&#39;s what I used to get\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;we\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; come from the 6th planet&quot; years ago.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A very large echo chamber can have a dramatic effect, like 12 inches\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; square, and 4 feet long. I made one that size out of MDF board and lined\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; wiht aluminum foil, the voices were so demonic sounding that I took it\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; apart.
