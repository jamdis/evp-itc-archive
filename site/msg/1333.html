<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Jessie, welcome to the forum. There are lot&#x27;s of web based 
resources with different suggestions on recording evp&#x27;s but the #1 bit 
of advice is to make certain other people nearby are speaking. The mic 
can be more sensitive than your ears and the recording is amplified so 
contaminated evidence is always a concern. If you&#x27;re recording with 
other folks make sure no one whispers, if they do announce out loud 
ythe name of the person and announce that they whispered. EVP&#x27;s often 
sound like a whisper and usually have a different accoustic quality, 
ex: the room noise or echo sounds different.

If you don&#x27;t have audio editing software check out &quot;Audacity&quot;. Just 
Google it, it&#x27;s a free download. You&#x27;ll want to transfer your files to 
a computer and sometimes filter out hum but be careful not to over 
filter. You can also cut down long recordings into reasonable sizes. 

Although, people have recorded EVP&#x27;s in many different places, try 
locations that you can connect with emotionally. This facilitates a 
possible psychic connection which some people theorize helps get 
successful recordings.

We&#x27;ll be listening , Bill

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I am from Northern Michigan, and am interested in capturing EVPS. I
&gt; have a digital recorder in which I have gotten a few my first try. But
&gt; I would like to see what others say as far as ways to get the best
&gt; results. So I am pretty new to this, but excited to try some
&gt; experiments. Thanks, Jessie
