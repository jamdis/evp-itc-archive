I haven't checked out how you have the group files set up, so maybe this su=
ggestion won't help anything.

Maybe you could set up and Member's EVP fold=
er for people to upload their clips to with the understanding that their cl=
ips will only be stored temporarily. Then maybe monthly you could delete th=
e old clips.

The keepers like Stephan's could be stored in a different fol=
der, maybe labeled "Reference", or whatever.

I think it is nice to have th=
em handy on the group site for a while because links in posts get buried so=
 quickly.

Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: File uploading rules DO NOT UPLOAD WAV FILES





       =
 If using esnips it has buddy list availability to add other members and yo=
u can post your link here when you update and upload new files.  The same g=
oes for storing it on any other file share site. Just post a link and let u=
s know when you upload new files. 

        I don't mean to seem anal but I=
 just went thru and cleaned out all the wav files and that alone took up mo=
re than 40% of our groups total space. For instance one member has posted a=
bout 10 files in mp3 format which didnt even equal 1/4 of the space taken u=
p by another members single wav format file. When it comes down to being 98=
% full you realize some changes have to be made and this is just one of the=
 many changes this group has had to make to allow more members to join us a=
nd have fair access.

        For those who are posting many files I sugges=
t you do the same because eventually it will come down to one of the mods a=
sking you to do so in order to clear some room. I like the idea of post now=
 then remove after a time period but the truth is that some peoples files n=
eed to remain without restraint such as Stefans who has been more than gene=
rous to post some files which may come in very handy for some of you to exp=
eriment with using his EVPmaker software. These files are for the group as =
a whole to make use of and they will not be deleted. 

        That being s=
aid, ask for help when you need it and feel free to share with people using=
 the best possible approach for the group as a whole rather than as an indi=
vidual. When there were only 5 of us here it wasnt a big deal, but once you=
 get past 500 it starts to take a toll and sacrifices must be made. Ive del=
eted alot of things I didnt wish to and had to ask alot of members who have=
 been around a very long time to help clear some space and they did so will=
ingly for the betterment of the group. They had some really great files too=
. Most now share them other ways including Sumption who started this group =
himself.
