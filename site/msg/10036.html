<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I formally thought &quot;hoax,&quot; too, until I found how easy it is for 
ghosts/spirits, etc to use these different devices we have today to 
communicate through.  

It&#x27;s almost as if the ability to talk to the other side has been 
there the whole time, or better yet, that the other side has been 
communicating with us the whole time, but we simply needed to 
become &quot;awakened&quot; to it...

&gt; When I first listened to the Spiricom samples several years ago, my 
immediate impression was: Hmm, it sounds like someone using 
an &quot;electronic larynx&quot; (speech aid device). This impression was 
strengthened by the observation that the buzzing sound often was even 
modulated by O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s own voice during the dialoges between him 
and &quot;Dr. Mueller&quot;! (Did O&#x27;Neill forget to remove the device from his 
throat while talking to his counterpart?)
&gt; 
&gt; And what about the &quot;13 frequencies&quot; that are supposed to be used as 
the &quot;carrier&quot; for the spirit voices? Why aren&#x27;t they audible in the 
recordings? And why does a mixture of the 13 tones created with 
Audition sound so different from the typical &quot;Spiricom buzz&quot;? - Well, 
if you analyze the frequency spectrum of the buzzing sound (this can 
be done with Audition etc.), you will find a lot of harmonics (peaks 
in the spectrum), and some of these harmonics more or less match the 
13 Spiricom frequencies...
&gt; 
&gt; To me, the entire Spiricom saga produces more questions than 
answers...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks Guy, I have heard a few people mention that O&#x27;Neil hoaxed 
it 
&gt; &gt; but I don&#x27;t know enough about this to really pass any sort of 
&gt; &gt; judgement.  Looking forward to seeing your website.

&gt; &gt; &gt; In regards to the Spiricom story - I have to assume you&#x27;re 
referring to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Mark IV model as diagrammed/written up in the Spiricom 
manual (as 
&gt; &gt; &gt; opposed to the INCORRECT diagram made by Polish researcher 
Wojciech 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Drewniak...http://www.worlditc.org/k_06_spiricom.htm ).
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; While my research is still not finished (and I&#x27;ve been working 
on this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; for a little over 2 years), I&#x27;m leaning toward the Mark IV 
&gt; &gt; &gt; conversations as having been hoaxed by Bill O&#x27;Neil. HOWEVER - I 
believe 
&gt; &gt; &gt; he acted alone and that none of the other members of the 
Metascience 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Foundation were involved with this hoax. As to O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s 
motivation for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the hoax - I still don&#x27;t know. But I will also say that the 
veridical 
&gt; &gt; &gt; evidence that O&#x27;Neil claims to have received about Dr. George 
J. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mueller through clairaudience is amazing and it is tough to see 
how 
&gt; &gt; &gt; O&#x27;Neil would have gotten this information given his finances, 
location, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the timeframe, etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve been promising to get my personal website up and operating 
for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; some time now but have been busy. Hopefully soon. Then I&#x27;ll 
start 
&gt; &gt; &gt; posting what I have found out so far.

&gt; &gt; &gt; P.S. The recordings of the Spiricom cassette that can be found 
at the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; GOS website ( http://www.ghostpix.com/spiricom/spiricom.html ) 
are very 
&gt; &gt; &gt; poor. Scott L over at Ghostly Talk pulled much a much cleaner 
version 
&gt; &gt; &gt; directly from a source cassette provided to him by Mark Macy ( 
see 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ghostly Talk show archive noted as a &quot;Bonus&quot; and &quot;Repost&quot; for 
August 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 22, 2006: http://www.ghostlytalk.com/node/616 ).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     I&#x27;m new on this group. Not too sure whether this topic 
was 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussed already or not but I wanted to get your oppinion on 
the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiricon device.  Does anyone know more about it?
