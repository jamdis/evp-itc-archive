Margaret,

Before I became engrossed in box research I had done tons of research 
with every method of ITC imaging.

I did Video Loop, water reflection, crystal, mirror, you name it.
And got pretty good results from most.

My most astounding visual itc came from a dicovery in my home.
I have a crystal window in the front door of my house facing west, 
when the sun starts to go down it shines through this crystal window 
and projects onto the walls in my family room.

I was sitting watching tv one day and happenned to look over at 
something that caught my attention, when I looked over there was a 
face looking back. I ran to get my digital camera and that started a 
year long process of experiments and spirit images I name VPI (visual 
projection imaging) I have literally hundreds of detailed images of 
spirits that where reflected through the crystal onto the walls in my 
home. as far as I can discern the spirits were forming the images 
inside of the crystal window, and the sun was acting as sort of a 
slide or movie projecter. Projecting their images onto the walls when 
it came through the window.

I had a page on I am haunted for the longest time, and drew quite a 
following for my images. Alas since I discovered box research I have 
not done one imaging session.

What got my attention was the mention of the horse image. I also 
captured the image of a horse, very detailed and a cat that you would 
think was sitting right in the room.

Maragaret, please post the link to your site I did not get it and I 
would love to take a look.

If anyone is interested let me know and I'll post some of my images.

Bruce
