<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Judy.  I think if that type of research interests you and you can afford the $160 (and 
anything else you might need to go along with it for EVP purposes), why not?  For myself, I 
just find it to be too time consuming and frustrating to go through so much recorded 
material for so little in return, content wise, when we already have the ability (albeit in it&#x27;s 
infancy) to engage in real-time, or nearly real-time, two-way conversations.

Yes, Sarah got amazing results and bless her pioneering spirit which helped bring us to 
where we are today.  I&#x27;m not sure how much of her success was her equipment and how 
much was her energy (I think we are all a component in our sessions).  In regard to 
traditional EVP work, given how good many of today&#x27;s inexpensive digital recorders are, 
that is the route I&#x27;ve gone for situations where sweep isn&#x27;t an option.  I&#x27;ve gotten good EVP 
with my Panasonic RR-US360, the Sony B26, and a handful of others.  I know some are 
still successfully using cassettes.  

I guess it all boils down to a matter of preference and the type of EVP research that most 
interests you.  As my dear hubby says, &quot;Whatever floats your boat!&quot; ;-)

If you do decide to try Sarah&#x27;s method, let us know how you do.

&gt; Hi All, Been awhile since I&#x27;ve posted here, but was wondering about the 
&gt; methods Sarah used with her reel to reel tape recorder (Technics or 
&gt; Teac model - anyone know which???) as it seems she got MANY Spirit 
&gt; voices or EVP&#x27;s this way. Not to knock, Frank&#x27;s Boxes or other Ghost 
&gt; Boxes!  Just a though! I may have an opportunity to get a $160. 
&gt; refurbised Teac or Technics reel to reel tape recorder, but am 
&gt; wondering IF I should get it or not (it&#x27;s a 1970&#x27;s model appearently)! 
&gt; Comments/ideas?  Thanks!   =Judy=   8-D
