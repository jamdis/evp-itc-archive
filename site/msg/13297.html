I think Misty makes some good points, and I agree that the issue is similar=
 to how one exposes a child to a belief system, such as a religion.=A0 I ag=
ree, too, that it will depend on the individual situation, as some will do =
this in a healthy way, and some may not: for example, we could all probably=
 name some religious cults that have been more harmful than good.=A0 In the=
 ITC world, I suppose a bad situation would be one where a poor ITC researc=
her (one who thinks they are getting results, but isn't) insists to the chi=
ld that they can hear spirits. And I suppose a good situation would be as M=
isty suggested: where an open mind is presented to them.=A0 

And as Frank =
noted, this likely also depends on the child. And Frank also mentioned some=
thing I thought was interesting: mental health.=A0 What is normal for menta=
l health is often defined as what the majority believes.=A0 Since ITC is st=
ill not as big a belief system as other religions or belief systems, it cou=
ld be seen as abnormal by the uninitiated.=A0 And if Social Services were t=
o get involved (depending on how open minded the worker was) it could resul=
t in a messy situation for someone who was insisting they could hear voices=
 talking to them over the radio or other devices.=A0 

Or do you think this=
 is an overreation on my part to what Frank meant there?
