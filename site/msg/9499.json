I was =\r\n17. She was 15. She had had her second kidney transplant a few months earli=\r\ner and died of gas gangrene.\n\nShe died at 3:15 PM and I felt it. I knew tha=\r\nt she had died. It is very difficult to explain, but I knew that she was go=\r\nne. So, it wasn&#39;t surprising to me when I got home from school and my eldes=\r\nt sister was on the phone telling my Mother that Rena had died.\n\nMy Mother =\r\nhad moved us to Texas from Oklahoma a few months earlier. I knew that Rena =\r\nwasn&#39;t doing good as she was before I left, but no one expected her to die.=\r\n She made a turn for the worse late that morning and by 3:15 she was gone. =\r\n\n\nLate that afternoon I took the Greyhound bus back to my hometown in Oklah=\r\noma. When I got to my sisters house, it was around 1 am. My sister is 18 ye=\r\nars older than me, so I have a niece that is a year younger than me. My nie=\r\nce and I both heard Rena call my name and I then heard her call my name aga=\r\nin a little later before I went to bed. That night after I had gone to slee=\r\np, it woke me up as I felt someone sit on the side of my bed. I knew it was=\r\n Rena telling me she was okay, but this was before I knew anything about th=\r\ne paranormal, so I was a bit scared to open my eyes and see her. \n\nShe was =\r\nmy first love and I am hoping that I will hear from her someday via EVP/ITC=\r\n.\n\nI consider myself very blessed to of heard her call my name and sit besi=\r\nde me to let me know she was okay. \n\nWishing everyone a wonderful weekend.\n=\r\n\nJeremy \nNew York, New York \r\n------=_NextPart_001_0386_01C89C7B.5F965FA0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Dunicode&quot;&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16643&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY id=\r\n=3DMailContainerBody \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-RIGHT: 10px; PADDING-LEFT: 10px; PAD=\r\nDING-TOP: 15px&quot; \nbgColor=3D#ffffff leftMargin=3D0 topMargin=3D0 CanvasTabSt=\r\nop=3D&quot;true&quot; \nname=3D&quot;Compose message area&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D=\r\n4&gt;Hello Rhonda and Everyone,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D4&gt;=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D4&gt;I have heard my name c=\r\nalled out loud before, but it \nwas not an EVP situation it was after my fir=\r\nst girlfriend died.
