I basically used Mike Coletta&#39;s set up he did with the \nghost box, minus the ghost box and direct recording the session.  \nListen to the audio, as it is much clearer and may provide a better set-\nup for adjusting it than direct plugging it into the audio recorder.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nLC\nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I recorded this with a RS 469 patched direct into by handheld \nrecorder.  I hear a two sylable word over the background noise.  Hoping \nI can get some help from the group to define the word or words.  \nThanks   Ron L\n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Looking for last minute shopping deals?
