<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Shame on you April :) (sounds like me) LOL. I&#x27;ll give you a hint. I believe it says &quot;let&#x27;s wait and bury him&quot; This was from inside the house where I stay. There is one EVP that DOES sound simular to my voice. It is the one &quot;keep moving it&quot;. I&#x27;m thinking (because is what I have read) that the growling type evp (as in keep moving it) are of the lower life form types. And the EVP was having a difficult time speaking (seems like I can hear breathing too) Then real words began to form. And to me it is very close to some of my voice traits. Maybe in &quot;keep moving it&quot; he was like a foreigner using the &quot;accent&quot; of his teacher?? But this upload (that I didn&#x27;t say what was said) has e &quot;robotic-mechanical&quot; cadence.Well...it too was simular to the &quot;keep moving it&quot; as well. There sure was a lot of echo in my home recording. I have read recently that need to do checks (record in differnt locations) in the same room. Because furniture, walls, curtains  and air currents can all affect your evp results or success.  --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;April Abercrombie&quot; &lt;april@...&gt; wrote:
