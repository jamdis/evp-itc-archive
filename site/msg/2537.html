either.  If i had a couple hundred bucks to spare, i would get on 
the phone and say hey.  We&#x27;ve been friends, but maybe he is too busy 
to send e-mails anymore.  There are a lot of suckers out there and 
until recently frank...you were one of em&#x27;.

&gt;  We were supposedly working together to do a &quot;Scole&quot; like thing 
here weekly starting last month, but that quickly bit the dust as 
Moon doesn&#x27;t seem to understand weekly, nor consistencey, as the 
first voices requested. He also never said anything about being on 
C2C again, and &quot;Frank&#x27;s Box&quot; will be  specifically discussed, as 
mentioned in the show promo on the C2C site. I think niether Moon, 
nor the C2C staff want facts to interfere with the discussions! I 
think he can stick his &quot;Scole&quot; meetings, and any other scams up his -
----, and may he get the spirit contacts he deserves!

&gt; Sat 10.20 &gt;&gt;Paranormal investigator and editor of Haunted Times 
Magazine, Christopher Moon will discuss hauntings as well as his 
work with Frank&#x27;s Box, a device which summons the dead&quot;
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  Great, once again making public claims about a system he&#x27;s never 
paid a dime for, makes untold amounts of money with, has no 
knowledge of how it works, and what it&#x27;s really for....on and on! 
better hit send before I really get pissed!

&gt; Frank-- are you and he speaking or on the outs? I think I may have 
missed a rapprochement between you this summer when I was off in the 
wilderness camping.
