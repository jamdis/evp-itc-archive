If I had the chance to test one of your machines, I wouldn't do that. I don=
't really care about that part of it. I just want to prove legitimate, spir=
it communication if I can. If I was testing the box, and I didn't get what =
I considered to be spirit communication, I also wouldn't call it a loss eit=
her. Just because I can't get anything, doesn't mean it can't work for some=
one else, under different circumstances. The worse I would ever say was tha=
t my results were inconclusive. I have heard it working for you, so I know =
it is possible, therefore I could never disprove it.

That wasn't meant to =
be a hint or anything, I am just sayin'.
