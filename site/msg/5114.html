By the way, Nick is my son, age nearly 16. :)  The box
seems to like him a lot and actively seeks his
participation. It also seems to react very positively
for my friend Julie, who is lurking somewhere out
there. (Say hello, eh?)

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Box in the morning

                  
Hey,
	Anyone have any odd problems in the morning with
using it.  I am  
sitting here checking my email so i just thought i&#x27;d
turn it on  
and... not check my email.  Anywho.... Then right at
about 6:20 i  
heard a voice say  &quot;Nicholas Etheridge please turn off
the dsfnlsd&quot;   
not quite sure what word it used... possibly portal. 
I just thought  
it was weird.  Also under all of the jumble and this
voice speaking i  
heard a deep male voice almost chanting &quot;seven&quot;.  Not
sure if I  
actually heard this or its the want to have an excuse
to stay home  
and not take the HSAs.

Anyway.. just curious if anyone has gotten heard this
or if they know  
something I don&#x27;t about using the box in the morning.

Peace,
Nick
