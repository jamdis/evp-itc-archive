They could not hear the responses aloud, as I \nhad the audio piped directly into a mixer, then outputted to the \nrecorder (but I could hear & had on headphones to listen in).\n\nI immediately then uploaded the audio to my laptop, and began playing \nthe audio aloud, allowing the group to help me analyze what we had \ncaptured.  We received great messages that were not lower level, but \nsentences of information (not just &quot;hi,&quot; &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; etc).  \n\nSo, I would like to add to this discussion that group sessions can \nwork well, but it may depend on how you do it and what the intentions \nare.\n\nLC\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Steve   Just to jump in with a friendly point of view.  I was \nreally appreciative of you providing the videos on the boxes.  One \nreason for my excitement is because I wanted to see the new RS 125 \nthat I have ordered.  The other reason was because I want to \nintroduce a techie type friend to this whole phenomena and I thought \nyour presentation would be a good starting point.   After watching \nyour video you satisfied my first interest, but I chose not to refer \nmy friend to the video.   I found the video to be very interesting \nand I was only a little disappointed that responses to your questions \ndid not come across to my ear.  But I could only imagine how a newbie \nlike my friend would react.  Even though he is a techie, I think he \nwould have wanted to HEAR something from the other side.  I felt that \nsomeone who did not previously know about the successful sessions \nthat so many researchers have had here, would have experienced a guy \ntalking to himself or, worse yet, asking\n&gt;  questions to a radio and then answering himself.  Again, I think \nsomeone who takes the time to see such a presentation also wants to \nsee the results.  After all, getting a message from the other end is \nthe purpose of what&#39;s being done.  Audience expectations should not \nbe underestimated.   Hope this helps.   Thanks again for the \nvideos.

I was going to go and do a brief background on my \n&gt; limited time so far in ITC and box research and maybe turn the \n&gt; different devices on for those to hear how each one sounds. I \n&gt; probably wasn&#39;t going to ask questions due to the halloween event \n&gt; when i received no spiritual contacts, but that wasn&#39;t a meeting \n&gt; either where i could explain what i was doing. I also am going to \n&gt; bring the 4 spare hacked 470 radios i have to offer to potential \n&gt; future researchers. Nothing is etched in stone yet with me going, i \n&gt; have to contact them first and see if that&#39;s what they want. I was \n&gt; supposed to go in November, but declined because i wasn&#39;t ready to \n&gt; display yet. Now, there is so many different radios out there that \ni \n&gt; can offer the idea for those who wish to approach this research \nwith \n&gt; an open mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday \n&gt; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Steve,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I listened to the file, It could have said what is labeled.\n&gt; &gt; It was kinda rough and I don&#39;t think anyone but an experienced\n&gt; &gt; researcher used to listening to Frank&#39;s box would hear anything\n&gt; &gt; from the random mode especially.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think you may have gotten caught up in the moment, I know those \n&gt; group sessions can get exciting.\n&gt; &gt; My advice would be to hold off on any public display sessions \nuntil \n&gt; we refine the communivation to \n&gt; &gt; where the average listener is capable of hearing a response. \nDon&#39;t \n&gt; forget what happened on halloween in staten Island.\n&gt; &gt; Or what happened to those knuckle heads at pulse radio.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think it would be detrimental to the research not to go \nsomewhere \n&gt; and have a group of people hear nothing but what \n&gt; &gt; they discern as noise. for the simple reason that they are not \n&gt; equiped to hear the actual responses.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just my opinion as afriend and fellow researcher. also I believe \n&gt; our friend Frank believes that the box was not meant \n&gt; &gt; for field work and does not perform to the best of it&#39;s ability \nin \n&gt; a public situation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@: urkel23@: Sat, 2 Feb 2008 22:11:07 -\n&gt; 0500Subject: [EVP-ITC] File from tonight\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have been having weird sessions with Frank&#39;s Box #27, but in a \n&gt; good way. They told me to change the antenna, which it did and the \n&gt; random started working and never has on this box. They told me \n&gt; tonight to put the old antenna back on and the sessions keep \ngetting \n&gt; better and better. I dragged Juli and Joel in on what i believed \nand \n&gt; felt was going to be a great box session and here is a file only a \n&gt; couple minutes in to our hour long session. This is a bit rough \n&gt; sounding, but hearing it live is pretty clear and you can hear me \n&gt; respond and than Joel agrees that he heard it too. My sessions are \n&gt; pretty incredible since the random mode started working on the \nFB#27 \n&gt; and i feel the random is the best thing out there...hands down. I \n&gt; have done Sessions on the internet through Skype all week and i \nfeel \n&gt; the energy between Juli and I are really bringing them through \n&gt; clearly. I only use FB#27 now in random mode and it is the best \n&gt; feature on any box, between the white noise, echo and random there \nis \n&gt; no competetion up to this point. The hacks are good, but nothing is \n&gt; better than an original frank&#39;s box. Our friends on the other side \n&gt; told me that they fixed the random mode to go and teach others and \ni \n&gt; am going to a meeting on wednesday to demonstrate the different \nboxes \n&gt; and our friend made a promise to come though if i go....so we will \n&gt; see.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here is one of the files i got so far.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Who&#39;s never won?
