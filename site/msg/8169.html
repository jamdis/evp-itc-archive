Holly,
              Frank's Box, Joe's Box and the Mini Box clips are similar to the audio with the Spiricom.  The RS Hacks were not designed for the purpose of two way communication, where as the actually boxes were.  I think in my opinion that the audio gotten then is just as good as the communication we are getting now (which is just my own thoughts).  
   
               I think that the more people who's curiosity gets the better of them to try this form of communication, the stronger the audio becomes!
   
       Juli

          I think its sort of along the lines of what Frank is workin on now, with the robochip type thing....if ya listen to his clips from those it sounds very similar to the old Spiricom that Doc Mueller used and doesnt have the sounds of the band sweep.  I dont think it actually uses the am/fm radio sweep on the newest device Frank's workin on (but I may be wrong).

I bought my radio shack 20-125 and hacked it. It's not going to be my 
final device. But, right now with my limited knowledge it will have to 
do !!!!
(by the way) thanks Bruce for your response to my email.

I found the site with the Mark IV spiricom and it recordings of Dr. 
Mueller (quite remarkable isn't it ?!?!)
What is it about their device that doesn't seem to have the annoying 
background noise of the sweep, the clarity of the voice is remarkable
and there is actual conversation going on ?!?!?
