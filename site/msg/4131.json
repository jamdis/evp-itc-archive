Very nice... good job!  You \ncovered all the bases and shared some very good information. Thanks!\n\n- Mike\n\n-----\n\nAll my Radio Shack Hack videos can be found at:\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The folks behind the event at The Stanley Hotel that Frank attended\n&gt; last month have invited me for a chat tonight to discuss ITC. I&#39;ll be\n&gt; on Darknessradio.com at 9 p.m. Pacific time. This message has been\n&gt; posted after speaking to Frank since for me, ITC includes the research\n&gt; that is covered by this group as well as the video ITC experiments\n&gt; I&#39;ve done. -Bill\n&gt;"}
