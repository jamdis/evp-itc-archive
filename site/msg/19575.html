<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have tried both.  I think the Spectrogram program is too outdated and the
resolution is really bad.  It has a save to bitmap, but does not allow you
to save.  This program was developed for Win 95 and the last update was in
97.  There is not even an option to register it so I am assuming it is
unsupported software and this version was freeware for testing purposes only
(hence the no save option).

The SEA wave software on the other hand offers much better resolution but
less parameter tweaking.  There is no logarithmic function like the other
software has.  In the original link, the person claims to have achieved his
results via visual logarithms, but after seeing the visual quality of
Spectrogram, I seriously doubt that any of the images he posted are real.
 But, this software does allow for instant snapshot saving.  As a
feedthrough device for GBC, it may work much like it does over on the Bridge
site with an instant snapshot function.  But, this version is a demo that
only allows for processing of 128 mB.  To actually stream a whole session,
you will have to upgrade the software.

I still find it interesting though and it may have some use if the spirits
can manipulate it.  There are some amazing images that have been captured at
the Bridge site over the yeas.

&gt;  I have tried numerous EVP files and short box clips and so far
&gt; nothing discernible has appeared on either program.  I still have a lot of
&gt; hope though.
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but I am going to try to work this in to a
&gt; session tonight!
