"I do not control what spirits say though, after

 too. "

Actually, it's more interesting than that.=C2=A0 Not only do you n=
ot control what the 'spirits' say, you also don't control what broadcast ra=
dio says, and to a large extent you don't control what your brain finds and=
 interprets in the noise you are hearing.

I listened to these (trying not =
to look at the labels, since once a person looks at the labels, they prime =
their brains to interpret the sounds in YOUR way, not their own way).=C2=A0=
 To me, they were either just a mess of random radio snippets, exactly what=
 you'd expect if a 3 year old were randomly twisting the radio dial, or the=
y were just noise.=C2=A0 Nothing paranormal in the least.

I think your ins=
tinct to stop posting this stuff might have been a good one. I suspect you =
are feeling a bit overwhelmed with this field right now, and it may be some=
thing is nagging at you inside someplace, saying it is a waste of your time=
 or a burden on your life and health, or that you just need a little more s=
pace for a while.

In any case, I'd recommend a break: take a nice month of=
f.=C2=A0 See how you feel being away from all this for a while.=C2=A0 Come =
back fresh if you feel ok after that.=C2=A0 But if you feel obsessed when a=
way, it might be good to ask your friends and loved ones for some opinions =
on what they see in you.=C2=A0 Your health is more important than anything =
here anyways, and you can't really do a job with interpretation of your res=
ults, much less your other responsibilities in life, unless you put your he=
alth first.
