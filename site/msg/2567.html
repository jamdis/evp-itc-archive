<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have had many instances where crystal clear EVPs I have recorded 
have often been heard by myself and others several times, only to be 
reviewed again and suddenly no longer heard. 

In agreement with Frank, sometimes there are voices I hear, messages 
that come through in my recordings that no one else can hear at all. 
I have always known these messages were meant for me, and I am 
grateful to have had the privilege of the communication.

&gt;  I didn&#x27;t get to listen, I can&#x27;t get to the Yahoo group site from 
here at work, but it&#x27;s a huge problem that others seem to rarely hear 
the voices the same, if at all. I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve 
posted voices from my boxes(and other esources) that to me seem 
perfectly clear, and no one else can hear it. I think the concensus 
is that the voices are like to tuned to the individual, which makes 
getting &quot;proof&quot; pretty difficult. I think this stuff is mostly to 
prove to the individual that life continues, and we get just enough 
that can be shared to get others interested.
