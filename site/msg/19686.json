Remember the saying, *&quot;In the\n&gt; twinkling of an eye?&quot;*\n&gt;\n&gt; 10,000 years here may only seem like a few precious moments over there, and\n&gt; vice versa.\n&gt;\n&gt; They also remind me of the quantum field, string theory, our holographic\n&gt; Universe (etc) and that *ALL time is &quot;ticking&quot;* (past, present & future)\n&gt; at the very same moment. It&#39;s all happening RIGHT NOW in various levels,\n&gt; layers, alternative realities and spiritual/energetic dimensions.\n&gt;\n&gt; The end of the Earth has already happened (for them and us!) in many ways.\n&gt; Depending on who you&#39;re speaking to, some even describe *what it was like*when the planet Earth was destroyed, speaking as though it has/had already\n&gt; occured. There would also be dimensions in which this event has already\n&gt; occured thousands of years ago, 5 minutes ago, 3 days from now and 10,000\n&gt; years into the future and every other possible scenario.\n&gt;\n&gt; So which one is the RIGHT one then?\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, I think they all are.\n&gt;\n&gt; Because &quot;they&quot; live in a world of &quot;source energy&quot;, light, consciousness and\n&gt; perfect information fields...one that&#39;s so completely and totally different\n&gt; to our own experience here/now and are not limited by linear time and\n&gt; local/non-local space or relativity like we are, it&#39;s likely very difficult\n&gt; for most of the beings we would speak to through the box to give us specific\n&gt; information regarding such an event or the exact time (or even &quot;which Earth&quot;\n&gt; they are referencing, dimensionally speaking!).\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, they don&#39;t experience any of this stuff (and\n&gt; especially &quot;time&quot;) like we do.\n&gt;\n&gt; To end, for several years now I&#39;ve been a devoted care-giver to the ancient\n&gt; quartz crystal skulls of Mayan legend and much of the mythologies and\n&gt; folklore surrounding these objects is focused around 2012 and the\n&gt; impending Great Shift. I&#39;ve also studied South American culture (past and\n&gt; present), anthropology, folklore and tribal customs along with their\n&gt; indigenous wisdom systems in varying depth with the Kogi Indians, Quechua\n&gt; Curanderos and residents of the Amazon.\n&gt;\n&gt; For many years I followed the work of Terence McKenna rather closely and\n&gt; Terence is someone I consider a man-genius far ahead of his time (may he\n&gt; rest in peace). He developed a time-mapping system based on the I-Ching, the\n&gt; Mayan Calendar, Great Pyramids, DMT-beings, fractals, plant\n&gt; consciousness and other mathematic systems that showed a sharp spike\n&gt; followed by a near-perfect &quot;dip&quot; before it went off the charts and moved\n&gt; into &quot;nothingness&quot; completely around December 21st, 2012...and even Terence\n&gt; didn&#39;t think this is when the world would end, necessarily.\n&gt;\n&gt; (His &quot;official&quot; position is that he simply didn&#39;t know what to make of it\n&gt; or expect. One theory is that his algorithms reflected such a change during\n&gt; a time that humanity may have finally broken the time/space barrier and\n&gt; uncovered the keys to time travel and 4th dimensional plane-shifting, to\n&gt; name just one possible solution.).\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve also been fortunate enough to live in Swaziland, South Africa with the\n&gt; Swazi, Zulu, Xhosa and San Bushmen tribes who (like most other cultures\n&gt; throughout time and history) also have their own teachings and mystery\n&gt; traditions surrounding\n&gt; this and other events.\n&gt;\n&gt; Given that the San are the most ancient tribal peoples and humanities\n&gt; oldest ancestors still living in the world today and whose incredible\n&gt; healing knowledge, spiritual wisdoms and mystical practices far exceed any\n&gt; I&#39;ve ever heard of or personally witnessed anywhere else in the world and\n&gt; they don&#39;t seem to feel that life on this planet is going to end anytime\n&gt; soon, so I&#39;m not going to panic just yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; These amazing people have their ears pressed up very closely to the\n&gt; heartbeat and rhythms of Mother Earth and told me firsthand that before the\n&gt; end comes certain events will take place on a scale the whole world will be\n&gt; instantly made aware of...events that could still take several hundred or\n&gt; even thousands of years to unfold.\n&gt;\n&gt; All I know for my own self, personally, is that I have no clue what&#39;s going\n&gt; to happen...but it will be okay, no matter what takes place. There are worst\n&gt; things than dying, believe me...and part of what makes our work with the\n&gt; Ghost Box and ITC in general so helpful and inspiring is that we can find a\n&gt; level of peace and comfort through our sessions and recordings we might\n&gt; actually need one day, whether soon or in some distant time - we&#39;re all\n&gt; going to end up there eventually, no doubt about it!\n&gt;\n&gt; *FINAL NOTE:* I don&#39;t have all the answers...I don&#39;t even have all the\n&gt; questions, and I know it. My guess is as good as any and I could be\n&gt; completely and totally WRONG about all of this (I&#39;m open to that and I&#39;m\n&gt; perfectly fine with it). Believe you me, if the world ends when a lot\n&gt; of folks think it might I&#39;ll be just as surprised as anyone. Until then I&#39;ll\n&gt; keep doing what I do now; realizing that I don&#39;t know a damn thing, taking\n&gt; life as it comes to me day by precious day, treating it with respect and\n&gt; honoring my experience here as the gift it is, loving others, being good to\n&gt; the people around me and enjoying my family and time spent here while I can.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; And I won&#39;t be afraid...not even for one second or when I&#39;m looking up and\n&gt; seeing that big f***ing rock heading right towards us, hahaha. For all I\n&gt; know (or anyone here for that matter), I could be blindsided by a Mac truck\n&gt; later this evening!\n&gt;\n&gt; Many of the people worried over 2012 won&#39;t even be here when 2012\n&gt; arrives...now how&#39;s THAT for a mind-f**k!?!?\n&gt;\n&gt; ;)\n&gt;\n&gt; -J\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Mon, 12/20/10, Urkel23 &lt;urkel23@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Urkel23 &lt;urkel23@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: A bit of validation\n&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Monday, December 20, 2010, 4:10 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank,\n&gt;\n&gt; Remember last year when we both got the August predictions?
