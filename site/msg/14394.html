<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Now I may be biased to the &quot;investigation&quot; way of doing things.  I do clean
up evps if I hear something and can&#x27;t make it out do to ambient noise.  So
hear is my question.  When do you stop cleaning up?  Wouldn&#x27;t to much
enhancing &quot;taint&quot; the results?  To me the more enhancing you do the less
convincing it becomes.  I hope noone finds this offensive, it is not meant
to be I am just really curious.  The way I look at it is that if you have to
do so much enhancing to find anything, was there really something there to
begin with.  Are we just making ourselves believe there is something there??
