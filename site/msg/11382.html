seanjankowski1 , thanks for the detail I requested and best of luck with your project. Through much trial and error I have determined that the use of germanium transistors can be helpful as far as clarity of EVP voices. There is a four page thread over on AA-EVP forum where I outlined my experiments with a four (germanium) transistor tape recorder (DC bias) and a germanium transistor walkie talkie. The walkie talkie is used mainly as the microphone pre-amp for the tape recorder. The equipment vintage is 1963. This is one of the captures.
&quot;David you found the voice&quot;
Thanks 
Dave

Spelling corrections, information corrections... Thanks for the edit
and for the information. I&#x27;ll make sure before I post again that I
have all the information straight. Not here to argue or anything as a
matter of fact I want to thank you for giving me the facts as they
should be. It&#x27;s been a while since I actually read anything from WITC. 

As I said, I was searching out ways to bring all the devices and their
uses into one unit. It might help prove that the phenomena is real if
I could get multiple confirmations on one unit. Of course you can
always just use many units at once and get the same effect. 

Thanks for the info.

&gt; There is NO research anywhere which shows that germanium diodes are 
&gt; superior to silicon diodes as far as the &quot;diode method&quot; is concerned.
&gt; 
&gt; Konstantin Raudive didn&#x27;t pioneer the &quot;diode method&quot; (sorry - exactly 
&gt; who did escapes me for the moment). I have a copy of &quot;Breakthrough&quot; 
&gt; which is the only English translation of any of Raudive&#x27;s books and 
&gt; the &quot;diode method&quot; is described in an appendix. The diagram in the 
&gt; appendix note shown there (and I can scan in the page in the book and 
&gt; post here, if anyone likes) shows a typical 1N914 diode which uses 
&gt; silicon as the base semiconductor.
&gt; 
&gt; The only &quot;transcommunication device&quot; I&#x27;m aware of that specifically 
&gt; called out for the use of germanium was the one diagrammed by the 
&gt; spirits in one of the Scole Experiments (and even then - it was a 
&gt; block of this material - not a component diode).
&gt; 
&gt; By the way - it was &quot;Konstantin Raudive&quot; (with a &quot;k&quot;), &quot;Franz Seidl&quot; 
&gt; (not Seidle...See Jean de Muelder&#x27;s website for original diagrams of 
&gt; the Psychofon from Seidl&#x27;s book 
&gt; http://jeandemeulder.transcommunicatie.nl/psychophone2.htm) 
&gt; and &quot;George Meek&quot; (no &quot;s&quot;). Additionally - George Meek&#x27;s Metascience 
&gt; Foundation developed at least 5 different models of the Spiricom 
&gt; (most people are only familiar with Bill O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s Mark IV).

&gt; &gt; Sure RetroCom,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; According to WORLDITC there are many different devices using 
&gt; different
&gt; &gt; aspects of the radio and white-noise spectrum. Constantine Raudive
&gt; &gt; used germanium diodes to capture EVPs. Siedle built his psychophone,
&gt; &gt; George Meeks had the Spiricom tone device. Now you have the diode 
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; white noise, radio wave HF static, and a tone device. I am 
&gt; attempting
&gt; &gt; to build an all in one audio recording and communication device. I 
&gt; am
&gt; &gt; doing this to see if by having a combined unit you can get contact
&gt; &gt; with either one or the other or perhaps multiple contacts at one 
&gt; time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you define with some detail &quot;all ways&quot; ?

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is my first post. I was wondering if anyone had created an 
&gt; all in
&gt; &gt; &gt; one ITC EVP device. I know that researchers such as Seidle had 
&gt; created
&gt; &gt; &gt; the psychophone that seemed to cover many aspects of ITC but I 
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; yet to see all ways of communication in one device.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have created an all in one design that covers most of the 
&gt; devices
&gt; &gt; &gt; used. If you wish I will share the design.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
