I just document each and move on. They said in one evp that &quot;5 to 1 people dont hear perfectly&quot;. I had asked why theres such a difference in perceptions. Reminded me of some test they gave in school where everyone wears earphones and they make you raise your hand when you hear a tone. \n   \n  I sometimes get the CLEAREST evp ever and only a couple people hear it as I do. Then there are times when I get messages that I think are &quot;crappy&quot; in quality and yet everybody can hear the same message. I learned a long time ago what each individual hears is thier own perception, and that if they cant hear a message it just wasnt meant for thier ears to hear. Most things we get are for us but there have been times when messages are sent for others. \n   \n  As far as translating goes, go with phonetics and work your way up from there. I often get messages in other languages so actual translation must be performed.
