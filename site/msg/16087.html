Hi Everyone & Frank,
I just completed my first RS-470 Hack, and was success=
ful in my first 2 mini session. Mine bc I so startled that I got a reply on=
 the first try,(got "Frank" on the other end, not Frank S.) then on the sec=
ond session, I tested the radio by telling them I'm writing a name on a pie=
ce of paper, which was my name, "John", and they told me "John" before I co=
mpleted the "n". I, unfortunately didn't hook up the RS-470 to a recorder d=
ue to that I didn't have a microphone set-up to mix me and the box. While t=
his was happening, I kept hearing my walls admit the sound of furniture mov=
ing, I looked around my duplex, nothing was moving, I looked outside to see=
 if my neighbor might be home, but his car wasn't there. I got spooked, eve=
n though I've been an investigator since 1998. I did remember to tell them =
to go back to the other side before I shut my unit off, they said, "wait", =
then "o.k.".

On the next day, I tried another session that didn't go so we=
ll. I live in SE Florida and there is so many radio stations that I was bon=
barded with sound and I guess my ear wasn't quite trained enough to get the=
 astral being/ technician on the otherside. I did 2 session and felt helple=
ss to all the different station that were coming through. Later that day, I=
 was able to get a mixing unit and hook up my professional microphone (I wa=
s a Dj in a former life), then attached the RS-470. I asked for a technicia=
n and for reply with a name, I swear, I couldn't hear them, and kept saying=
, "repeat your name". I thought to myself, "I would have been pissed gettin=
g someone that couldn't hear me, asking me to repeat my name, over and over=
 again. Upon playback on my computer, I heard the responses, His name was P=
ete, and after asking his name again, he said, "I Did". I definately did wa=
nt to piss off anyone, especially someone I haven't met before, but especia=
lly a spirit that I can't see. I did asked them to test the unit by repeati=
ng the word "Dragonfly", I got a reply, but it was very weak. Sounded like,=
 "ragon fly". You could hear the fly more than the dragon part.

Is there a=
 way to squelch the bonbardment of stations coming throught? If I can't hea=
r them, will they get pissed off and stop communication? Beside being a inv=
entor, ie, Frank Sumption, who I feel is the most qualified and talented in=
 this field, can "we", those who have little technical skills, do any bette=
r in getting a, or creating a better unit from the RS-470 hack? Does the tr=
aining of your ears take a long time with the multiple use of this unit? Am=
 I hearing the otherside, or am I fooling myself into hearing what I want t=
o hear from fragments of the stations coming through?

I would appreciate a=
ny response to my questions and any help in my quest to be a better RS-470 =
Hack owner.

Happy Haunting,
John Marc Carr
