Well, things got noisy again on our boxes folks, the first group have gone  
through, crossing into the Light, they are happy campers now, but now here 
we go  again, another group of darkside rabble rousers are fighting to get 
into the  line, and some are baddies, they don't know what the heck they are 
going to do  yet, stay in darkness for the 1000 years or repent and cross 
into the light,  here's one sad fellow asking for help, you should here all 
the dark ones he is  around, hope fully he got help.  This new group of people 
are swearing,  like drunken sailors, just like the other one did, they it 
was quiet for awhile,  now all these new dark side people must make a choice 
to either get in line or  stay in the mud.  Hope you can all hear this one, 
i didn't send the cussing  guys, sf
