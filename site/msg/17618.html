<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You have nothing to worry about there Frank. There isn&#x27;t anything anyone can
do to make the boxes go away. Even if they somehow convinced everyone else
that there isn&#x27;t anything to the ghost boxes, would that matter to you? It
certainly shouldn&#x27;t.

&gt; No. It&#x27;s the dorks that try to claim scientific testing to make something
&gt; like the boxes go away, despite the fact the countless users get verifiable
&gt; information almost daily through the box, and yet these crackheads
&gt; deny-deny-deny!! Need I remind anyone how many times &quot;science&quot; has been
&gt; wrong--over and over and over--it&#x27;s a freaking useless discipline, all it
&gt; does is build egos!

&gt;&gt;   From what you&#x27;ve posted so far, it sounds like an interesting effort,
&gt;&gt; and I look forward to reading the entire study.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also, from what you posted, it did not say they didn&#x27;t use double-blind
&gt;&gt; testing. It says one of the reasons they do not consider the current
&gt;&gt; radio-sweep claims reliable, is that those making those claims do not do
&gt;&gt; double blind tests.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So if you are calling BS and clueless those who are not doing double blind
&gt;&gt; testing, that begs the question - are you?

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  It&#x27;s probably not kosher to post this, but I find this highly insulting
&gt;&gt; to all of us. As usual, igonore all facts and all other methods, such as
&gt;&gt; EVPmaker, which forms all the voices inside the computer. Ignore all phone
&gt;&gt; EVP messages, ignore all voices heard with no electronic aids. Ignore
&gt;&gt; messages received via turned off TV and printers--and on and on, yet they
&gt;&gt; know all about EVP..Ignore the fact that probably thousands use boxes
&gt;&gt; successfully.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &quot;We have conducted a few listening studies of reported radio-sweep EVP and
&gt;&gt; the results have not been good. We have also worked with a variety of such
&gt;&gt; devices. Based on what we know about trans-etheric influences, how EVP and
&gt;&gt; visual forms of ITC are formed and what we know about mediumship, it is
&gt;&gt; difficult to fit radio-sweep into any established hypothesis. Without solid
&gt;&gt; research supporting it as producing EVP, it is impossible for us to
&gt;&gt; recommend it or support its use. If there were double-blind studies
&gt;&gt; conducted by experienced researchers that shows it does produce phenomena,
&gt;&gt; we would gladly promote it as an alternative technique.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We are pretty sure that, in transform EVP (ordinary recorder), the voice
&gt;&gt; is formed in the electronics by transforming available audio-frequency noise
&gt;&gt; in an active part of the electronics such as a transistor junction. We think
&gt;&gt; the process is amplification of a weak telekinetic signal via stochastic
&gt;&gt; resonance and we have found that the optimum audio-frequency signal for this
&gt;&gt; is a chaotic one rich in voice-frequencies with many transient perturbation.
&gt;&gt; That is our working hypothesis. &quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I can&#x27;t say who this is from, cuz almost certain I&#x27;d get sued. There&#x27;s no
&gt;&gt; double blind testing their BS either. Clueless!!

&gt;&gt;&gt; When people start calling themselves experts at something that is not or
&gt;&gt;&gt; may never be fully understood the crap gets deep. I love these so called
&gt;&gt;&gt; experts that tell us that we can only make contact using their exact methods
&gt;&gt;&gt; and we need to refrain from any other way of doing research because in their
&gt;&gt;&gt; eyes were just spinning our wheels. So we can&#x27;t get communication from
&gt;&gt;&gt; modified radios and were all just hearing what we want I guess. I have heard
&gt;&gt;&gt; it all,,&quot;I wrote a book and im an expert&quot; or &quot;believe me that wont work, I
&gt;&gt;&gt; know cause im physic&quot;….in one ear and out the other. Everyone is an expert
&gt;&gt;&gt; these days and most of what they say is BS. If I start hearing someone or
&gt;&gt;&gt; something talking through my dogs butt guess what im recording it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sounds like these so called experts are just trying to deter and silence
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything they dont agree with by doing there Scientific tests. If it works
&gt;&gt;&gt; it works and if it didnt work what the hell are we all still doing here.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thousands

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Pseudo scientific BS! Their testing reveals exactly what they expectt,

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; is the nature of the paranormal. Getting the results they wanted, they
&gt;&gt;&gt; puff
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; out their chests and proclaim yet another victory for science! Science
&gt;&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; a habit of supplying exactly the results wanted by whoever is paying

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; First, where do they find people that are somehow qualified listeners!?
&gt;&gt;&gt; WTF
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; is that S---!? It&#x27;s BS, and they know it. Same old skeptic/science
&gt;&gt;&gt; crap,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; except from a group that wants to be the worlds onlyest EVP authority.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m sure there will be articles in major paranormal mags proclaiming
&gt;&gt;&gt; how
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the experts thoroughly debunked the boxes.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; They keep testing and getting nothing, and the rest of us keep
&gt;&gt;&gt; recording
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; and have no shortage of voices that others can hear, can be validated,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; gives infromation that&#x27;s unknow to the listener. I just posted a video
&gt;&gt;&gt; where
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; a voice says &quot;I said fuck&quot; just to show it&#x27;s not broadcast frags. This
&gt;&gt;&gt; stuff
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; conveniently ignored. I&#x27;ve been kicked off groups for getting voices
&gt;&gt;&gt; thast
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; somehow were judged not ghostly enough, cuz all the experts know ghosts
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; can&#x27;t cuss, they can barely even talk and communcate!
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; They send me their stupid results thinking I&#x27;m the one out there
