Perhaps it is just a failure to merge with the collective. I finsd often when they speak they try to obtain thier original voice. I have gotten phrases with accents as well as them seemingly surprised by the end result and remarking "I used to have an accent". 
   
  I used to get many other languages in my evp. Once in a while I will actually understand it and save it. They think more together and speak with one voice as asked so I dont get things I cant understand quite as much anymore. 
   
  Heres just a few examples for the french speaking. (Attaching to this email. If you dont get attachments and want to recieve them you must put your group settings on "individual emails") For the non french speakers they are simply asking "do you speak french" and some remark about a "bad boy"

to date, i can find no explanation why so many ghosts seem to speak 
only french or german-sometimes obsolete british "english" with a 
snobby accent. older or believing cultures, perhaps?

one possibility staring me smack in the face is the possibly 
irreparable trauma to the collective Id rendered by world war one.

........so maybe were looking at a perennial lost generation , now; 
hard to face.

ps, my wife is a multi degree'd french language professor and frank 
sumption fan.
