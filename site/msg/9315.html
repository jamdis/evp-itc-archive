Hey Guy's 

I read Frank's post about him shipping you two a Frank's box!

That is just great two more family members, I just want to say 
I wish you guy's the same sucess that we that have Frank's boxes 
have enjoyed.

And I know Chip Coffey is not a member here and I do not know him 
personally, but if someone happens to speak to him, please offer my 
congrats on getting #34, even though all three of you guy's took my 
title a newest box owner. :)

I can't wait to hear the files.
again welcome to the fold.

Bruce
