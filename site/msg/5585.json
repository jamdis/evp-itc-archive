I also have some friends from past lives, one is Otto.\n\n BTW, I wasn&#39;t able to listen to anyone&#39;s files tonight, I&#39;m \nuploading videos to You tube, and that almost takes all the band \nwidth. \n\n Frank-S\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jules&quot; &lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I was thinking tonight as Frank S. welcomed some of our new comers \nto \n&gt; the group if in fact anyone during a box session inquired to the \nnames \n&gt; in which the other side call us?\n&gt; \n&gt; For instance Frank has been addressed as princess, and I know I \nhave \n&gt; gotten a spirit stating he was my brother (I am an only child).  I \nam \n&gt; curious as to whether or not this could in fact be affilated with a \n&gt; past or former life.  That at one time Frank S. could have been of \n&gt; royality and I could in fact have had siblings.\n&gt; \n&gt; How far fetched is it that we could be actually talking to spirits \nwe \n&gt; once had a relationship with or if that is even possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would welcome any imput on my wild and crazy thoughts!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Juli\n&gt;"}
