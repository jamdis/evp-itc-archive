Greetings Vicky-
=C2=A0
I can clear this up for you. Unless you signed a le=
gal contract (reason I say legal is a contract must follow a specific forma=
t to be binding), the pictures are yours. 
Without getting too deep, ethica=
lly the previous group may ask that you credit that group as it was their i=
nvestigation. Example Photo Property of Vicky Cox, formerly of USA Ghost Hu=
nters. This is your choice, and as they are being turds, I=E2=80=99d tell t=
hem to pound sand. Keep in mind, some clients may have you sign a non-discl=
osure contract, meaning that no evidence may be posted without written cons=
ent of the client. 
Also, although photos taken are yours, if you post them=
 publically without a legal Copyright tag, or statement such as =E2=80=9CNo=
 photo may be copied or reproduced without written consent of Vicky Cox,=E2=
=80=9D you risk anyone copying and pasting them for their own use without p=
ermission or acknowledgement to you. And even if you do Copyright, etc. peo=
ple still will do this.
Bottom line, it=E2=80=99s ghost hunting, not rocket=
 science. Hope that helped.

=C2=A0 




I have a legal question that I cannot seem to fin=
d an answer to. I recently went on an investigation to a public place with =
a=C2=A0 paranormal group. While my experience is much less than theirs, I f=
ound them to be too disorganized. Three people=C2=A0came from the group. On=
e had no equipment and the second used his cell phone.=C2=A0I never even sa=
w a pencil.=C2=A0So, I started a small group, specifically for=C2=A0amateur=
 investigators staying in local public places so we don't get in over our h=
eads. We aren't trying to get any resident investigations and are non compe=
titive. On our site I put photos and evps I had gotten while on the investi=
gation and put at the bottom that some evidence was obtained while on inves=
tigations with other groups. I didn't use any of their names. As with any o=
f my photos, I blocked out any faces, and it was all on my equipment. I sig=
ned nothing and agreed to nothing.
Yesterday he sent me an email saying he =
wants it taken down. It's technically and legally his ( technically and leg=
ally?). If I wanted to start my own group all I had to do was ask. He has s=
aid that I invited a 16 year old to join the group (Definitely didn't). And=
 that he thought I would join their group.
-I don't believe he's right on t=
he legal issue. Ethically, I would have accredited the group if he was more=
 diplomatic and maybe even taken it down. 
- wouldn't making false accusati=
ons make him guilty of liable?
- I don't need to ask him to do ****. I've m=
et him twice.
=C2=A0
Does anybody know of any place where I can find someth=
ing written on the law about those photos and media being mine.
