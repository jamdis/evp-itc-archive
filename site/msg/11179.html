            Why do you need to "sweep" the AM spectrum? 
  Has anyone tried this but without sweeps on the shortwave band? Has any research been done? Could it be that the AM band has some sort of "special properties" that would allow such communication? 
  Why is it that the AM band has to be used with a radio station playing? There are parts of the spectrum that is just outside of that spectrum that might provide a better form of communication.
