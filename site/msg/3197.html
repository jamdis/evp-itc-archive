<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I also meant to add that this mini-box is hardly going into mass  
production. If you want one, you have to cough up $400-$500, just  
like I just did. That fee alone is enough to deter casual users. The  
people who buy these are not going to buy them on a whim.

&gt;  It&#x27;s not that concerns are not considered, I think no one knows  
&gt; what to do with it. There&#x27;s not enough box users, and ITC  
&gt; researchers out there to really good feel for what the pitfalls  
&gt; are. So far after seven years of EVP/ITC work I can say onlly that  
&gt; these dark entities, or wahtever it is talk bad, and threaten, and  
&gt; that&#x27;s about all they do. They threaten, I tell them to bring it,  
&gt; and....nothin&#x27;! Paper tigers I say.
&gt;
&gt;  As far as some fears that portals are opened, and all kinds of  
&gt; evil comes in, I don&#x27;t believe that either. They are already have  
&gt; full access, they already exist in more demensions, making this  
&gt; physical level about the lowest level of spiritual existence/ 
&gt; evolution. Just about all these worries are old fear crap to keep  
&gt; people in church.
&gt;
&gt;  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to with hold the stuff cuz of a few nut  
&gt; jobs, you have the same problem with everything from bicycles to  
&gt; airplanes.
&gt;
&gt;  I had that concern about selling my boxes, but how would you  
&gt; screen users? You can&#x27;t. Not everyone can use a quija board, and  
&gt; not too many unbalanced ding dongs get in trouble with those anyway.

&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Family hour around the radio
&gt;
&gt; I am a fairly quiet person, most of the time. I have my thoughts and
&gt; opinions on topics but feel strongly about &quot;to each his own&quot;. Unless
&gt; something strikes me as completely wrong, I won&#x27;t debate. No one here
&gt; has heard from me other than recently with this mini-box yet, I am
&gt; here several times weekly reading and offering my energy in support of
&gt; the research.
&gt; However...something is striking me here and again, I can&#x27;t keep my
&gt; mouth shut. The discussion about the family hour with the box has led
&gt; the way for people to mention negativity and even &quot;the dark guys&quot; can
&gt; be fun if not taken seriously.
&gt; I ask you to consider the fact that many who purchase the mini-box
&gt; will not be of the right frame of mind. Most will not be in harmony.
&gt; Many will take &quot;the dark guys&quot; seriously. Yet, you feel it&#x27;s a good
&gt; idea to let anyone who wants a box have one? All in the name of
&gt; sharing technology.
&gt; I know that my previous posts expressing my concern over the mass
&gt; marketing of the box, was barely given consideration. Realize that I
&gt; am not being selfish- I do not own a box. EVP is my passion and has
&gt; been from day one 6 years ago when I jumped fully into the field. I am
&gt; successful in capturing EVP, always have been. I still do it the &quot;old
&gt; fashioned way&quot; with open air techniques. Would I love to be able to
&gt; hold real time 2 way communications with the other side? Of course.
&gt; However, I do not think enough research into the possibilities has
&gt; been done to warrant the approval let alone production of these boxes.
&gt; Those of us who have been on countless investigations with many people
&gt; will quickly admit that there are some people we&#x27;d rather not
&gt; investigate with. When they are present, negative things tend to
&gt; happen. We all know one or two people who we can say &quot;felt dark&quot; from
&gt; the first meeting. We all admit that being mentally sound is an
&gt; important quality in this field. If you have mental issues, this may
&gt; not be the area of research for you. We don&#x27;t bring children on
&gt; investigations for obvious reasons. BUT! If you want a box that could
&gt; possibly open up a portal and bridge the gap between here and the
&gt; dark, sure! Anyone who wants one should have it!
&gt; You might feel that I am over reacting or being overly dramatic.
&gt; That&#x27;s fine. My concern is not what you think of me but that you
&gt; consider the possibilities here. Many of which we do not know. Can you
&gt; be 100% sure that this is a good idea or that it&#x27;s worthy of saying
&gt; &quot;well, we&#x27;ll see what happens&quot;?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You have the right idea, I recently have dealt with a lot
&gt; &gt; of negativity from my Frank&#x27;s box. Harmony is very important
&gt; &gt; as is the right frame of mind before turning the box on.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; hope you &amp; the family had a good holiday.

&gt; &gt; Maybe we&#x27;re just a little unconventional in our household, but most
&gt; of us here are pretty open to the idea of the multiverse. Gathering in
&gt; a circle around our Frank&#x27;s Box is our idea of quality family time.
&gt; The messages are relevent, the interest is high, and we&#x27;re very well
&gt; grounded and do not let the tricksters push us around.Happy
&gt; Thanksgiving from our home to yours. -Bill
