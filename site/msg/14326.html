    For an EVP to be considered proof positive of spirit comm=

    As for the whistle, it sounded like feedback to me as well, but I =

ctronics or EMF's that could contribute to feedback. Even so, if I am tryin=

   Here again, we are back to the "So what?" thing. You don't HAVE to prove=

    The theory that is being kicked around is that some EVP'=
