<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think those are his own files he recorded either near the source of 
impact or using debris. He is just sharing as he goes. Giving the raw 
audio for those who would rather have that than the processed or 
denoised files. Interesting sounds tho.

&gt; On going through them all, I think I see now that you did not post 
12 samples. You posted perhaps four, with 2 or 3 duplicates as 
they&#x27;ve been variously processed. Is this the case? The processing 
to me sounds like audio-cleanup processing, based on the amount of 
audio pixelation it seems to have introduced, some rather severe? 
&gt; 
&gt; However, I didn&#x27;t hear anything in any of these other than noise. 
Is there anything particular you wanted to highlight? Were you 
looking for any input?

&gt; Thanks for posting.
&gt; 
&gt; I think in your original experimental specs, you request five 30 
second audio clips from five-to-ten people. Which would be 25-50 
clips. Here you&#x27;ve posted 12. Will you be posting the others?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I&#x27;d like to hear from the people who created these clips. 
How did you go about that? Did you do exactly five 30 second clips? 
Or did you do more, and send in just the best?
