Hi Kay,
 
That was what I posted on my original idea over a week ago and I was  blasted 
about it especially that I would look like a fool that I was willing to  take 
a loss of a few bucks.  But atleast the hacking information and links  would 
have been posted on ebay for all to see.

I checked to see what it would cost to sell one of ebay. To list it 
it  is $1.00 for $25.00-449.00 plus 8.75% of the initial $25.00 
($2.19), plus  3.50% of the remaining closing value balance ($25.01 
to  $1,000.00)


I would be willing to list the one I have plus give the  information 
on the free hacking and that fact that you can get one at  Radio 
Shack for $24.99 just to shut this guy down. At the most I would be  
out $1.00 to not sell it!!!! Well worth it I'd say.

Can someone  send me the written instructions on how to hack the  12-
249.

Kay
