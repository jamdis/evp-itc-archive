lol. well if they come here to live I'll put em to work, they can help me  
clean up this house, I doubt they would come here though, because it's a  
mess.  I have lots of pets, and my Autistic adult son likes to tear up  paper, 
so it gets scattered all over the place, all I know is I don't make the  
mess, I didn't do it, and I'm tired of cleaning.  My guides are so strong  
though, they may not get in the door, I have some really great guides I  
think<s>, and I'm sure not Whoopie Goldberg, lol in "Ghost."  Though  I have the 
movie, and a big screen 65 inch TV, hey, maybe they can come visit  and watch 
movies. lol

I hear that! I think many of them out there are used to going to  the 
supposed haunted location to get their messages out. It's my contention  that the 
entites travel, and will come to you when you dojm EVP sessions. As  such, 
there isn't really a haunted location, I think they are a show for the  
living, a way of showing that spirit exists in a place that isn't in your  
house, something many are affraid of.
