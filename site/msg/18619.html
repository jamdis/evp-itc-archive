what i dont understand is, why if people have others ideas, other opinions
etc. they must be freaked out?
why its not possible to accept other ideas and opinions and maybe take over
they statement in our existing personal ideas?
i really dont like the flame war that many people are starting over and over
again. they think, only what they made is 100% ok
the rest is BS. THATS NOT TRUE!
 
we all can learn each other from our experiments and experiences.
 
for example, look at my homepage www.transkommunikation.ch (i know, for the
moment only in german, but when i am finished 
with the german version, i translate it also in english, promise :)). look
now how many experiments that i have made so far. many 
and many differents methods. some are good, some are faulty, but these are
MY experiences, and these results are MY results. 
i want to say, everybody has his methods and if this methods are ok for him,
ok lets go. lets talk about, lets change our ideas
and our knownledge but always in respect from the other. if others make
experiments with radio fragments, and he
have results, that is fine for him. and if he publish his records or results
from his experiences, whats wrong with this?
 
now, lets stop that aggressive complain and lets talk together to reach our
goal. making contacts with "dimension X",
make the voices listen clear and try to find a way to see, what is the
"dimension X". 
 
ok? tutto bene? :)

ps: in the states you have many researchers concerning the paranormal
research. here in europe is the interest of
such things near 0%. what a pity. a reason more to concentrate our energy in
our goal :)

Many people here don't seem to understand anyone else. I'm beginning to
wonder since people can't even understand things sent by other living people
by e-mail, how can they understand anything spirits are trying to
communicate?
 
This is scary.

 I think groups pretty much useless. Everyone has a damn opinion that is
gospel truth. Then the freaking skeptics- that no one can question when they
say this all imagination, and when we question them we are attacking. Figure

attacked ?? Wow , how dramatic... It's just a fact that you will make Frank
mad again.
For instance: IT is very obvious that when Frank gets something from the box
about
stuff that says what is going to happen, YOU have to say I will add that to
your predictions.
Those are not Frank's predictions, he is just posting the messages, and it
is very clear
that he does not like you saying or posting that those are his
predictions.....
Maybe you should pick your words a little better in the future, or better
yet, maybe you should just
not say anything, and just put the info in your little files to save, and no
one would be 
the wiser..
I'm tired of giving you so much time in this group, so I hope I don't have
to ATTACK you anymore LOL

BTW, if anyone is wondering what I am talking about, this was a good
example.
I offer a suggestion on getting things back on track with less hostility,
and I am immediately attacked for making the suggestion.

that would be fine, if you didn't piss Frank off....... But you do.....
AND THAT IS NOT OKAY.....
The same thing will happen when you do it again....
So what's the point in you being here.

I expect none of us like all the recent attacks, insults, accusations,
threats, hurting of feelings, and attempts to piss people off. 

Can I suggest we stick to the purpose of the group: "the discussion,
promotion, and developemnt of Electronic Voice Phenomenon, and Instrumental
Transcommunication methods and technologies as used in the communication
with spirit, and other entities."

And that we go with Frank's philosophy "just take the approach, try
different methods, see what works."

No more threats. No name calling, insults, or accusations. Just try to keep
a positive group attitude, be open that not everyone believes what everyone
else does, and that's ok?
