<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Not sure what this flute sound is. The sweep hung up, and put AM reception
down below the band--I think. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s a weird feedback signal, as
it was only audible in the echo chamber. Could it be an amazing example of
spirit communication, naw, I think it much more mundane. It was after I put
the top cover on, so my vote is feedback notes.

 This is not intended to reflect on any other systems out there, real or
imagined, only my own work is in question.
