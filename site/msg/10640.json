Your boyfriend&#39;s opinion is one of the reasons why I put \ngreat weight on relevance \n&gt; of content in a session.  For example, when I recently asked for \nRees&#39; great uncle to say \n&gt; his name, and an immediate reply of &quot;It&#39;s Chuck Clarke&quot; is heard \n(even though Rees \n&gt; referred to him as Charlie, both are nicknames for Charles) I think \nthe odds would be quite \n&gt; astronomical of that being coincidence.  Same goes for any of us \nasking a question, any \n&gt; question, and receiving a relevant response ... it would be highly \nunlikely for it to be from \n&gt; stray signals (of whatever flavor.)  \n&gt; \n&gt; Then again, if he has trouble even hearing and/or agreeing on the \ncontent, it&#39;s going to be \n&gt; hard for you to get him to view an answer as relevant, even when it \nis.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have let my boyfriend listen to some of my files.

Any imput on \nthis? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kay\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
