I have so many strange phenomena and I have grown quiet, i suppose as others may have, due to ridicule. It has made me wonder if the ghost boxes pick up some of the human thoughts of the living. If the mind can influence machine I think it is very possible. \nI am not very knowledgeable on electronics but I have been looking for a group I can discuss some psychic phenomena. I would openly discuss it here but I do not want to distract the focus of the group.  perhaps I can explain my weirdness to the people who are in the GCP group or one of the sites. I could here too, if it doesn&#39;t bother anyone.\nThis seems to go right along with what I saw that I have yet been able to fully explain. Anyways, Thanks for the link.\nJennifer\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Fiona Broome&quot; &lt;email@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m interested in very recent EVP-ITC messages... what people have heard on boxes, etc.  \n&gt; \n&gt; This morning, there&#39;s an unusual display of RNG anomalies at the GCP (Global Consciousness Project) site: http://gcpdot.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; If you read this too late to see it, I&#39;ve posted a screenshot and some blather about possible connections, at http://extreme.hollowhill.com/global-consciousness-dot-blip\n&gt; \n&gt; At this point, it&#39;s a stretch to connect the dot anomalies with anything else.  I just figured I&#39;d mention it, in case anyone looks at the data and has an &quot;ah-HA!&quot; thought.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheerfully,\n&gt; Fiona\n&gt;"}
