<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>reading Rick&#x27;s and Frank&quot;s comments here i started to wonder.
what is the best way to post EVP&#x27;s ??
i know to crop out the segment that has the EVP you want others to hear 
and see if they can make it out.
So do we label the file what they are saying or just mark it with a 
number and keep track in a log file what that Number file says.??
I do like the idea of  not labeling the file what it is saying to see if 
they come up with what i think i hear.
But then again some times I&#x27;m tired and knowing what the file says when 
I&#x27;m listening to it from some one else does help.
