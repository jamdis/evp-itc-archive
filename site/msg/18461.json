{"id": "18461", "subject": "Wisconsin Paranormal Conference Looking for Speakers", "author": "msm00", "timestamp": "2010-08-15T20:41:27Z", "full_text": "This will take place on Nov 12=14, 2010 in Oshkosh Wisconsin. We are putting together our schedule of speakers and I would really like to add at least one speaker who can demonstrate ITC/EVP techniques and talk about it in general. Anyone here close enough and interested in doing this? \n\nWe can&#39;t pay much if anything but speakers get a free table to sell, promote, demonstrate, espouse, whatever. We expect to have a large attendance. We will also be blocking out rooms in the convention center hotel nearby and will be able to get reduced rates.\n\nIf you are interested in finding out more about it, go to http://www.wiscparacon.com.  The site is always being updated, so check back often."}
