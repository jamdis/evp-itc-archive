I'm working with a few really great techni=

 programs. 
=C2=A0
Getting images from our audio and employing visual modal=

we do. It makes so much sense to me and if it works as suggested will allow=
 our depth of communication to extend so much=C2=A0further than it has prio=
r to this...almost like a conscious mind (GBC, surface messages) and the su=
bconscious mind (sound/audio imaging and everything that lies beneath the s=
urface) sort of thing. 
=C2=A0
I really get a good, STRONG feeling about th=
is. It seems so obvious! =C2=A0
