<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yep thats true Charm, and also hit the local libraries. Depending on the year it happened, old newspapers, obituaries, or books can usually hold info like that and if its something curious they may already have a folder of info if it pertains to local history on the hotel. A simple phone call to the libraries in the vicinity should give you an idea if they have any mircrofiche or digitally saved info from that era.

&gt; you could look on the website for the city of Gatlinburg,
&gt; and check to see if they have a historical society there. (
&gt; we have one here) if so, they are usually a fountain of
&gt; historical information ( with the added bonus that they have
&gt; already done all the research and verifications, saving you
&gt; countless hours of doing it yourself)
&gt; If people ask why you want to know this stuff ( I have
&gt; never had a history buff ask me why I wanted to know about
&gt; history) but if they asked, I would say something along the
&gt; lines of-&#x27; im interested in the history of this
&gt; place&#x27;.. after all, historical stuff, legends and
&gt; stories real or imagined can be fascinating.
&gt; hope that helps and good luck
&gt; Charm

&gt; I am going to Gatlinburg, TN. While there I will be doing
&gt; an
&gt; investigation at a hotel. I was wondering where would be
&gt; the best
&gt; place to research two murders that occurred at the hotle.
&gt; Should I
&gt; start at the police department? I have searched the
&gt; internet, but
&gt; found no details.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance.
