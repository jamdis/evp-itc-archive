<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree wholeheartedly.  With the group of people I&#x27;m involved with
investigation wise, we decided when helping someone to only take
&quot;donations&quot; for gas, etc.

Although, wouldn&#x27;t you guys love to have a large entourage and reality
tv show?  Ghost Boxers, starring Frank Sumption. ;)

&gt; I for one would not have any interest in a &quot;certification&quot; program
or any fee involved with one. I do believe a fee for direct expenses
such as meeting room, coffee, equipment rental, gas expenses for the
coordinator etc. is not only appropirate but esential for a group
meeting. I also heartedly believe that a small fee for direct
expenses is important for demonstratingappreciation of value on the
part of participants. If zero is paid, it&#x27;s too easy to say &quot;yes, I&#x27;m
in&quot; and then never show.The money is a token. That&#x27;s been my
experience.But that&#x27;s just me. ron

&gt; Don&#x27;t laugh at this idea! A lot of paranormal groups do just this
and charge a good deal and then use the money to further their &quot;work.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Last night on Haunted Times Magazine radio , guest Brian Harnois
(Ghost
&gt; &gt; Hunters International) told the radio listening audience that he
didn&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; think anyone should use a Franks&#x27; Box, (or a ghost box is what he was
&gt; &gt; insinuating) unless they had training from Christopher Moon.
&gt; 
&gt; *LOL*. Frank - you&#x27;re not qualified to use your box, better go get
&gt; training from Chris. Better yet, we should change the name of this
&gt; group to Haunted Times EVP-ITC (tm).
&gt; 
&gt; My question is, who certified the certifier? Maybe we should start
&gt; our own certification club and state anyone who&#x27;s not training from us
&gt; is not certified. I&#x27;m sure some of you could use the money a lot
&gt; more? That way we can all be certified. Or would that makes us
&gt; certifiable? ;)
