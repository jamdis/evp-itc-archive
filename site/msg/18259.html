I have an old Aiwa it has two large stand alone speakers, it was down  
stairs for a long time, I got discourage because the dog chewed the plug end and 
 i just left it down there, it's got wet, being down there for couple 
years, I  just got it upstairs, i would like to see if i could fix it, but don't 
know how,  where can i buy a new electric cord for it?  Are they easy to 
fix?   Anyone of you want to take it and make a ghost box out of it for me?  
It's  kind of big, so I don't know what shipping charges might cost.  Wish I  
had got it up stairs long time ago, oh well. sf
