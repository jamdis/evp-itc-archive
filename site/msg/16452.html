S=
orry to hear that Frank. I can think of plenty of actual researchers who wo=
uld love to test one and are already getting great results with other metho=
ds and versions of your work. I am also sorry I didnt make it very far past=
 the second paragraph. Karen obviously does not research before she writes =
her articles.
 
"However, the precise location of the Sanatorium is a close=
ly guarded secret." 
 
Ummm Karen needs to learn to use Google as well. If =
she had she would have been able to print out a map to Waverly which includ=
es information such as tracks, businesses, adresses AND golf courses at the=
 corner.  It even shows you an overhead view of each building you pass alon=
g the way on each street. Hint to Karen click sattelite view after you expl=
ore closeups of map view. 
 
Im sorry but if you are going to write a well =
informed article the first step is become well informed. I wont bother read=
ing the rest of her articles because I wont waste my time looking at resear=
ch from someone who cant bother to cover the basics like look at a map befo=
re you drive out to someplace you've never been before and then misinform p=
eople that it is in a secret location. Nor do I see walking on a tour as as=
 actual "investigation" .
 
Alot of the people once believed the earth was =
flat, unfortunately they were not "well informed" and they too were victims=
 of shoddy research. Luckily there are those who do look beyond the horizon=
 and open their minds to the possibility that there is more out there.
 
Ha=
ppy New Years everyone and may your journey next year be in the right direc=
tion!
