If you also listen to the last clip, where they say it's tricky, its preference, a male voice appears to swear F****, and a women also say "I knew It".  
   
  Needless to say, I didn't switch the boxes!  I figured I didn't want to make them mad!

  I asked them if they thought I should switch boxes for better reception, and oviously Frank's Box just happens to be their favorite!
   
  Enjoy!
