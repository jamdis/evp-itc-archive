I actually have an EVP that says &quot;Get outta \nhere.&quot;  I was herding my chickens into the hen house one night and \ndidn&#39;t notice the recorder was turned on in my pocket.

The \n&gt;   smallest Yorkie let out a loud bark, and I swear it said &quot;get \noutta \n&gt;   here&quot;. I heard it as plan as any other speech. \n&gt; \n&gt;   I know, anecdotal evidence. \n&gt; \n&gt;   Frank-S\n&gt;"}
