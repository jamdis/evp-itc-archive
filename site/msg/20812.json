[2 Attachments]\n&gt; \n&gt;  Been gettng something aobut May 17th, now &quot;they&quot; say it starts May\n&gt; 15th--I&#39;m like WTF is this? There seems to be othere that have  pridistion\n&gt; as well, but it&#39;s almost as reliable as this stuff. This is from EVPmkaer\n&gt; tonight, using the origianl raw files I used ten years ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Thanks for writing Frank!  However, it was not me who made the\n&gt; prediction....I was talking about a Christian scholar who has done some\n&gt; research and through his recalculation has determined that the predicted\n&gt; 2012 shift will be occurring around May 17th 2011...he also says this is the\n&gt; date when Jesus will be returning to Earth.  Very interesting, we&#39;ll\n&gt; see......&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Soooo, whatever.\n&gt; \n&gt; F-S\n&gt;"}
