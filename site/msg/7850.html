Hi Chrissy
   
  Mike Colletta was nice enough to help out in that area and post some step by step video so you can watch it as he modifies the radio(s). Check out his site ufogeek.com =)
   
  Or heres the links for some of his youtube postings

  There are quite of few people posting thier sessions and you will find a few Frank S. and others did on youtube as well. 
   
  That pretty much covers the how to step by step, you can rewind or pause for each step thru the process. After that its just a matter of running the sessions and recording any results that might come thru.
