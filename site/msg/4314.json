The ad picture is of the older \nmodel 12-470 though, not the 12-469.  I know the Radio Shack website \nhas the same mistake; they have the two pictures mixed up. Their 12-469 \npage has a picture of the older 12-470 and their 12-470 page has a \npicture of th 12-469.\nThat is probably where this person got the picture from, thinking it is \ncorrect.  If that in fact was a real &quot;older 12-470&quot; he was selling, \n$14.95 would be a great price since it is very hard to find any olde 12-\n470 in the stores anymore.  Remember, only the older 12-470 can be \nhacked, no newer 12-470 (all black case) has been hacked yet.\n\nIf someone were interested I would contact the guy and ask him to take \na picture of the box. Then you would know exactly which radio he has on \nebay for sale.\n\n- Mike\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, a 12-469...now up to $6.49 plus $8.55 S/H.  ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;judy_in_hollywood&quot; \n&gt; &lt;Ticket_to_Heaven@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hey All, Just looked in at Ebay, and found, what appears to be, a \n12-\n&gt; 469 radio awaiting to be Hacked by one of you!!!
