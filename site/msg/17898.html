<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

Thank you, the &quot;young minds&quot; comment completely made my day!  (Hey, a few days ago, I took an online quiz and was thrilled to see that I&#x27;m not actually &quot;older than dirt&quot;! *chortle*)

Also, in reply to Frank: I agree. If this was a sterile discussion about EVP -- just reporting the news -- I&#x27;d be bored out of my mind. Sure, nasty, narrow-minded flames irritate me, but healthy banter makes this list fun!

Now I&#x27;m going back to lurk mode, while I get some zines ready to mail...

In haste,
Fiona

&gt; Hey Fiona, yes EVP is the focus of the group yest it is. So, what does that have to do with superstitious nonsense? Please tell me? Can we not keep the subject about EVP?
&gt;  
&gt; I am sorry but I thought this was a serious group about EVP phenomena. Instead its a sympathetic shallow collection of young minds. 
&gt;  
&gt; I am moving on and Snowfire may Jesus save you from the beast and from his dad.
