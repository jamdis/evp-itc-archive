The strength of your connection and the clarity\nof your messages depends on the strength of the bond or bridge you\ndevelop with your friends on the otherside. The equipment is only\nneeded to materialize the message. This is why you can use almost\nanything as a medium to bring them across.\n\nI love to see people learn on their own through their own reasoning.\n\nRegards,\n\nFrank R.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I think your correct Kay!\n&gt; \n&gt; psfponies &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:          Bruce \n&gt; \n&gt; I hate to say it but out of all the responses I have heard Mike \n&gt; Edwards seem to get the best reponses to his questions on his \n&gt; clickity 12-469 shack hack box.

But full fledged researchers. Of \n&gt; &gt; course they have much to learn, but so do we all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Which brings me to my suggestion.\n&gt; &gt; Steve and I have recently been discussing the point we have \n&gt; reached \n&gt; &gt; in the research, both in process and knowledge. We agreed on most \n&gt; &gt; points,\n&gt; &gt; the most important one being. It is time to move beyond the same \n&gt; &gt; mundane session content and the same rudimentary line of \n&gt; questioning.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This research is stagnating for lack of direction, any posted \n&gt; files \n&gt; &gt; or discussions revolve around the same stale subjects such as, \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Is there anyone there that wishes to communicate&quot;, \n&gt; &gt; &quot;What is your name&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;who am I speaking with&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;what is it like where you are&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I believe we have all received every combination of answer to \n&gt; those \n&gt; &gt; questions that we possibly can, yet we continue to ask them \n&gt; session \n&gt; &gt; after session. And still become amazed at a yes or no answer or \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; simplest of phrases.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am not saying this about any single level of researcher but all \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; us myself included have fallen into this rut. We are not learning \n&gt; &gt; anything, All our efforts are amounting to nothing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We already know that we are communicating with someone or \n&gt; something. \n&gt; &gt; I believe we have all come to believe that through our personal \n&gt; &gt; research and the evidence presented by all of us.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Within the last year the technology and potential of this type of \n&gt; &gt; research has exceeded all expectations in it&#39;s quality and speed \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; development. We are actually letting it go to waste.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I and a few other researchers believe that whoever is on the other \n&gt; &gt; side of the line has had a hand in some of us developing this new \n&gt; &gt; equipment and methods of research be it obvious or subtle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But our methods of research have not excelled, we are conducting \n&gt; &gt; research in the same manner as we did when there where only about \n&gt; 5 \n&gt; &gt; of us in the whole world actively doing this research.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; New individuals are joining our ranks and becoming interested in \n&gt; box \n&gt; &gt; research every day. The protocol they are being instructed to use \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; antiquated and obsolete.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is fine to teach them these methods as a basic foundation of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; research and to get their feet wet. But like any other education \n&gt; &gt; process it must evolve and develop with the accumulation of \n&gt; knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If we approached academic education the way we approach box \n&gt; research, \n&gt; &gt; we would all still be in the first grade.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I propose a committee to develop a method of research and protocol \n&gt; &gt; that can deal with the ever evolving technology and decide what \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; how we should approach the type of communication we seek and the \n&gt; &gt; subject matter that should be addressed, that will be continually \n&gt; &gt; changing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Only in this way will the wheels of research and learning move \n&gt; &gt; forward and we will gain the knowledge we seek and hopefully be \n&gt; able \n&gt; &gt; to share it with the world someday.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But if we continue to ask &quot;Is anyone there willing to speak with \n&gt; me&quot;\n&gt; &gt; We are doomed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyone that wishes to discuss this and give opinions or suggestions\n&gt; &gt; please lets try and get started every minute we waste is a missed \n&gt; &gt; opportunity for learning.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                            \n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
