<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just watching a show about UFOs/Philadelphia Experiment. Morris K. Jessup
wrote a book about that back in the 50s, then supposedly killed himself.
Well I get Jessup from time to time, and just found out from the show today
he had a daughter-Mary Alan Jessup. Just a coincidence that the name
mentioned in the manual sweep was &quot;Hi Mary...&quot;? It is not unusual for me to
get something via the box than hear it in real life in the next days.

&gt; I have yet to get any EVP that I&#x27;d consider as evil. Once got one upset
&gt; being who demanded &quot;Leave this building!&quot; but nothing of any consequence
&gt; other than that. I think all he (it was a male voice) was capable of was
&gt; making that statement.
&gt;
&gt; It&#x27;s funny, other voices in the same place said different things. I asked
&gt; if we should leave and a voice said &quot;You just got here!&quot; Another similar
&gt; question (Is it OK if we stay?) got &quot;Yes&quot; for an answer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  I don&#x27;t have the time and resources to mass produce this stuff.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Besides, I find what most want to use the boxes for, ghost hunting and demon
&gt;&gt;&gt; chasing very discouraging. I don&#x27;t know of anyone that uses this stuff, be
&gt;&gt;&gt; it hack boxes, or any other method to try to actually get higher level
&gt;&gt;&gt; contacts. No one just allows the entities to speak, all want to second guess
&gt;&gt;&gt; something that has more access and is in a higher state of being. Everyone
&gt;&gt;&gt; wants to be TAPS, and get the crap scared out themselves. Most hear only
&gt;&gt;&gt; what they want to hear. I don&#x27;t know what the answer is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Well, &quot;the box&quot; in nothing more than a radio with swept tuning--as far
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as I know and have experienced, sweep across the radios tuning range, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; band generates bits of speech music and noise that the entities use to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reform into their voices, although there maybe more involved, but I don&#x27;t
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know how one would test it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Most of the boxes for sale out there are the hack radio boxes. Many of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the modern digital radios have a function that mutes, or quiets the radio
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; while tuning between stations. I&#x27;m not sure why, but unmutting the radio
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; allows the audio to be heard while the radio searches for the next
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; station--and--the radio is disallowed form locking onto a station, so it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keeps sweeping all the way to the end of the band--AM or FM, then starts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; over. This creates the raw audio and &quot;they&quot; speak. The sweep can even be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; done by hand, tuning a radio slowing by hand. I sue cheap radios I get at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thrift stores for this, gluing a dowel to the tuning knob to make it easier.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then record form the speaker--open air.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  So as long as the radio sweeps at not to fast and not too slow, it&#x27;ll
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; works. Some are better than others.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  It takes some practice, and maybe even a certain allowing to hear the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ghost voices.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  I prefer to take a tuner out of a radio, such as a clock radio and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; supply an external sweep voltage. The sweep circuits are just basic op amps,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and you can buy a function generator kit to supply a triangle wave for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; linear sweep. See keyportparanormal.com for more info on using this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kit, and building boxes.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  One problem with this stuff is that it can be extremely subjective,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; others may not hear what you hear, or hear it the same. I think mostly the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; messages are meant for the one that receives it. We go round and round with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the skeptics and debunkers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, we&#x27;re new here hello!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We just had a couple questions. HOW do you tell if you&#x27;re being ripped
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; off if you are searching online to buy a box? If you can point us in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; right direction of where to purchase a &quot;frank&#x27;s box&quot; would be deeply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appreciated.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We saw that you can try and make your own but with my husband&#x27;s work
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; schedule and mine with 4 kids, sports etc.. the only time we get to work
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with EVP&#x27;s and such is when we schedule an investigation and secure a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; babysitter! LOL Not to mention my husband isn&#x27;t that technologically
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inclined. That is my job... and I would be afraid that I&#x27;d have done
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something incorrectly and what we were experiencing really wasn&#x27;t &quot;true&quot;.
