The part number is 42-2496.  I use them all \nthe time.  You can then plug in a recorder and speaker or ear buds at \nthe same time.\n\nEnjoy... and welcome!\n- Mike C.

I recently joined the group after becoming very \ninterested in EVP and basically \n&gt; the whole idea of after death communication. Thus far I have only \nused a digital recorder to \n&gt; record at random times during trips to cemeteries etc. without \nsuccess.Now I would like to \n&gt; try some more controlled efforts as far as set times, set questions \nand have purchased a \n&gt; hacked radioshack 12-469? \n&gt; \n&gt; My questions if anyone can help\n&gt; \n&gt; my hacked radio has no external speaker only a place for earbuds, \nis there some kind of a \n&gt; cord or connecter I can get that will hook it to a external \nspeaker? how about some kind of \n&gt; cord to hook it to a digital reorder..or a spit cord to do both?? I \nam very, very electroncially \n&gt; challenged so do these exists?? what are they called? and where can \nI buy them?\n&gt; \n&gt; my next question has to do with attempting to record EVP , anything \nyou have noted which \n&gt; seems to encourage success?\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks in advance!\n&gt;"}
