Yeah Frank knows he left a few details out, he mentioned that a while back its why he keeps updating schematics. The ST method is something him and Dave termed, and I just took the idea, ran with it and put it to the test...still testing. So far it works as well for me as any other method tho its sound frequencies can be heard easily by more people.
   
  Congrats to you both on your upcoming engagements I wish it wasnt on the other side of the states i'd drop in. I am not much of a "speaker" but I try and get my typing in as much as I can hehehe. Im a big goof when ya stick me in front of a room of people. 
   
  You should give it a try I think you may be surprised. But again, I am getting great results with all methods as far as my own hearing goes...but I do see others can hear these easier for the most part. It has to do with the frequency levels it hits. Spirit says 5 to 1 people do not have perfect hearing and that is why we all hear so differently and why some agree while others cant hear a thing but static. Think of it as a dog vs human scenario...dog whistles hit that frequency many people cant hear...I hear them but for some its silence....for the dog its very loud and clear. I think they match each recording mediums vibrations and in effect tune into speaking in a way so you can hear them...even if you are the only one that can hear them.
   
  Very interesting about the stone circles, I was just thinking of this not too long ago and also researching "singing" stones after I saw a headline about them on the news. They do exist. Some also have electromagnetic functions which come into play. I love rocks, always have, and I have collected them since I was small long before I knew as much as I know now. They also play a big part in some of my ITC images that have come thru. They still shock me with the clarity sometimes. 
   
  It is all very very humbling for me. I am nobody special, not someone who wants to be famous, nor one who would have ever thought I would/could be involved doing research on something such as this for so long and remain so dedicated (or is that addicted LOL) but one small voice sent me on a sharp turn and now I am on this path. 
   
  Paranormal has always been just normal...now moreso than ever. I think perhaps they have always been watching me and they are the voices that kept me awake at night, the invisible person sitting on my bedside so I couldnt fall asleep and would scream for my mama to come stay with me until I fell asleep. I could probably name 1000 things that I have witnessed and others have witnessed over my lifetime but too tired to start that list tonight LOL

  I never realized how closed my eyes were until they opened wider. I always knew what was there I just never realized it in detail.

          Thanks, Bill! (Pssst...check is in the mail...he he)

I want to make it clear that I was NOT criticizing Frank about his 
box or the document! It's just that I read it over thoroughly 
yesterday and found some things that were missing or unreadable. 
Otherwise - it's the only "one-stop shopping" for details on Frank's 
box. The setup is not rocket science...anyone versed in electronics 
could build one and even improve on the design (I have several 
thoughts on that).

I haven't had a chance to check out Misty's "sweep tuning" method 
but just that name seems to indicate something close to the "manual" 
way of creating Frank's box as I previously mentioned (i.e. randomly 
pushing radio buttons).

Lastly - as Bill said - he and I will be presenters at the 
conference in July. My particular presentation (which I'm still 
piecing together) will be on Paranormal Sound Phenomena. Rather than 
rehash techniques for recording/analyzing EVP - I plan on going into 
more depth on present/past research in paranormal sounds (such as 
playing the first spirit voices ever recorded, ultrasonic pulses 
detected at stone circles, etc.) and make a plea to participants to 
stretch beyond present emphasis on just recording said sounds but 
get into broader research projects. I'm not one to "toot my own 
horn" but I'm also slated to appear on the June 3 show of Ghostly 
Talk (http://www.ghostlytalk.com) to go into more depth on the 
famous (or infamous) Spiricom Mark IV story.
