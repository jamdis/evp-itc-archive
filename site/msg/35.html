What ever it is you guys do, the voices are crystal clear. I am just waiting to hear how this works? In my mind <lol> i would think that these are carryover voices on the3 radio. Like the TV thing <ofcourse of neither i have ever even seen done live or tried lol> that the imigaes are carryover. Where as just doing it on my PC, i know that no voices are in the room by accident or getting a signal from another pc <radio staion tv channel>
