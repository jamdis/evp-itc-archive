&gt;I played the &quot;from our system&quot; one first. That one I hear quite different 
&gt;on first impression tho I did hear some of what you did.
&gt;
&gt;   &quot;From a distant (three point eleven) star, tell a story today. &quot;
&gt;   Under that I hear &quot;(theyre bombing in north kira)&quot; but I also hear the 
&gt;end the way you did if I stop/start it at the right point

&gt;Usually some can&#x27;t hear foreign language method voices, especially those
&gt;that speak the language. &quot;Norma&quot; is my wife, and &quot;Max&quot; is the kid from next
&gt;door that used to be over almost everyday to work with the voices, but he&#x27;s
&gt;lost interest of the past year.
&gt;
&gt;The foreign language method is just using a shortwave receiver to pick up a
&gt;foreign language broadcast, and recording it open air style, placing the
&gt;tape deck, or recorder a short distance from the radio, and announcing you
&gt;are doing an EVP recording. Almost any language will work, I like the voice
&gt;that come through using Japanese, or Chinese. I use my ham rig as a
&gt;receiver, but also have a compact Sony AM/FM/SW. Charli Claypool told me
&gt;about this method, and she uses languages from the internet. I used this
&gt;method to demonstrate EVP to the guys on last fall&#x27;s hunting trip, they we
&gt;able to hear the voices straight from the little tape deck I used.
