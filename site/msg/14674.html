Thanks Zack-Huge help.

Do you think this sounds like a possible cause of t=
he taps/EMF spikes? Would a bad power meter cause the tapping sound?

    Hi All,

    Is there someone here th=

    During the case that I r=

 the lights in the Kitchen will dim occasionally.

    Now these taps are n=

    Thanks!
    April
