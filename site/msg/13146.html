Richard, Misty, and all other fellow researchers,

This is =
a fasinating topic, one that I am currently most interested 
with as my lat=
est experiment/research project is all about.
The crash debris that was sen=
t to 8 researchers, I believe, does hold 
imprints from a violent past.
As =
does the area where the original crash happened, since there are 
still amo=
unts of debris scattered around the immediate area, as well 
as beneath the=
 surface where now stands a memorial. Not to mention 
it is the last place =
where living humans were quickly lost. Just 
imagine the amount of energy t=
hat must be imprinted on that exact 
spot.

That is where I hoped to gain a=
 better understanding of that energy 
which is imprinted... and I must say,=
 I think I have done just that.

Today I processed a number of the files I =
captured from the impact 
point using numerous devices of the non-microphon=
e type. After I put 
each of these files through a four step process (which=
 I'll explain 
in great detail in my video), I was able to listen to some a=
mazing, 
and very relivent sounds.
My wife was so upset after I told her wh=
at I had heard, she refused 
to listen to the audio.

Let me just say... th=
e combination I used was able to capture a very 
chilling scene. One I just=
 have to believe were the last moments of 
those who perished.

Once I publ=
ish the final results, I hope others will be able to 
verify what I am hear=
ing...

I'm figuring to put a multi-part video on my Youtube page. One part=
 
explaining what will be seen an heard, as well as describing the 
events =
of that day. Another part with my sessions at the various 
locations, using=
 various methods. And a final part with the audio of 
the researchers who a=
ssisted with this experiment using the debris I 
sent each of them.

Bottom=
 line... I really do believe that energy is imprinted in 
objects, and at l=
ocations where energy was strong at a time of 
imprint.

Happy Holidays to =
all.... have a safe and fun Holiday Season!
