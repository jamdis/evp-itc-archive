It is truly ironic that part of my professional background and training happens to be in broadcast production. So I am intimately aware of what it takes to produce and distribute television programs and why and how this is done. I concur completely that it is inaccurate to view these shows as "reality". They are of course "entertainment." (Actually they have their own classification which came into being a few years ago.)

What is troubling, perhaps only to me because of my background, is that such shows have come to represent to the public the state of affairs in this and related fields. The more investment there the more this is obvious.
