This is for reso=\r\nnance inside the box(hence the name echo chamber) correct?  \n\nSo things I p=\r\nossibly need to take into consideration when building mine are:\na.  Types o=\r\nf material provide better results, copper and aluminum versus materials tha=\r\nt absorb/dampen such as egg crate foam or cloth lining.\nb.  Size of box (le=\r\nngth, width, height) to produce the suspected resonance frequency.\nc.  Amou=\r\nnt of chambers (I noticed 3 is the magical number )  Having chambers increa=\r\nses the resonance effect more than just having an empty box without chamber=\r\ns.  \nd.  Outside influence such as air which is why Frank mentioned it need=\r\ning to be air-tight\ne.  The types of outside influence is from the spirits =\r\ngetting to the inside.  So is it or is it not a good idea to wrap the box i=\r\nn absorbing/dampening materials since they are manipulating the sound insid=\r\ne a box?  I wouldn&#39;t think that it would matter what&#39;s on the outside as lo=\r\nng as noise from the outside isn&#39;t bombarding the outsides of the box causi=\r\nng internal problems and distorting anything.\n\nPardon my thought process, b=\r\nut I&#39;m just trying to learn the concepts here.  So if I am way of base, wil=\r\nl someone please let me know.  :)\n\nThanks,\nBryan\n\n\n----- Original Message -=\r\n---\nFrom: Bryan Whatley &lt;bryan_whatley@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom\nSent: Saturday, April 26, 2008 7:07:26 PM\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Copper =\r\nChannels\n\n\nThis is for the echo chambers right?
