I have to say I was skeptical about the Frank&#39;s box but no longer, it has been amazing and for validation I asked them to say my name which they did several times.\n I have had several paranormal experiences all through my life and it led me to do more investigations.  I have several evps from my digital recorder without using Frank&#39;s box but decided to add a new tool to my equiptment and so far am very pleased with it.\nHugs to all and continue the search for the truth.\nDiane"}
