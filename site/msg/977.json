I have in no way perfected it, but then again it seems no \none has....but I am constantly upgrading, only to find the older \ntools seem to work better.\n\nI am interested in knowing how or where to hear these evp clips you \nhave been posting about most recently.  Looked in the files and links \nhere and found nothing recent.\nCan someone clue me in?  \n\nAlso, I want to learn how to use the am radio sweeping for evp.\nI have a few oldies around here I&#39;d like to try it with, but i need \nto know how and what to connect it to.  \nIf anyone has time to explain it in layman&#39;s/beginners terms I&#39;d \nappreciate it very much.  \n\nI am also practicing on an old 1950&#39;s reel to reel.  I&#39;ll let you \nknow what I come up with.  Very exciting.\n\nI am not a &quot;ghost hunter&quot;, not into finding anyone&#39;s relatives that \nhave passed on...just connecting to the other side for beneficial \nand/or useful information for myself, and others.  It gets more \ninteresting as I go along.\n\nNice to meet/read you all and will write more soon.\n~ Lunalamia"}
