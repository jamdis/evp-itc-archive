I have sony acid pro 6, I use it for loop creation for a website Im working=
 on currently and for a track for a animated video Im doing for the intro t=
o my site (that Im doing in 3d studio max 9). As far as I can tell sony aci=
d pro is really not a program you'd want to use for evp related things, I m=
ean you can but you are over complicating what you want to be doing. What I=
 use for evp's is cool edit pro. I dont believe the new company that took i=
t over calls it cool edit pro any longer but, I use the older version becau=
se it works great for evp's, so if you google it you can find it no problem=
, it makes it easier to strip out ambient noise (like white noise) while le=
aving the voices completely entact. its basically like diving deeper and de=
eper into the sound and it works great for it. Regards,
