Hi Bruce~I understand the light heartedness of the "family hour" posts. =
I don'ttake any issue with that at all. The families of those of us involve=
din the paranormal HAVE to be a bit different then the average Joe's orSmit=
h's. I only referred to that topic because of the other stuffmentioned- neg=
ativity and dark ones.There is absolutely nothing in place to safe guard wh=
o purchases thebox and who doesn't besides the cost. If you've got the mone=
y or acredit card, the box is yours- whoever "you" are.I don't think we sho=
uld presume anything about the purchasers of thebox. I know people in the f=
iled who have never experienced anythingevil or dark and wouldn't know what=
 to do if they did. Admittedly,they can be and will be deceitful. I am in f=
ull support of further research and groups and individualsworking together.=
 However, IMHO, I think this falls into a differentcategory. Morally and et=
hically, I think it is short sighted toapprove of or promote in any way, th=
e distribution of this device atthis time. When we imagine the possibilitie=
