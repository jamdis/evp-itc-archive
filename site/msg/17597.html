<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>&quot;Listening to the box is certainly not like listening to an EVP and I
personally disagree vehemently with the people out there who call box
communications EVP&#x27;s!&quot;

I totally agree. Electronic Voice Phenomena is a completely different
animal. That is not to say however that one couldn&#x27;t get an EVP during a
ghost box session.

&gt;
&gt; So you have stated that the person conducting this study was an EVP expert?
&gt; That leads me to question how the study was actually conducted. Listening to
&gt; the box is certainly not like listening to an EVP and I personally disagree
&gt; vehemently with the people out there who call box communications EVP&#x27;s!
&gt;
&gt; In an EVP situation, you are listening closely for a voice to sound
&gt; typically over the quiet. A box session forces one to listen through the
&gt; noise as opposed to the silence.
&gt;
&gt; Were these sessions recorded and listened back too or was an analysis made
&gt; strictly from real time? I do sessions all the time and I am lucky if I can
&gt; pick up 35% of what comes through in real time.
&gt;
&gt; And finally, try not to be too dismayed. An EVP &#x27;expert&#x27; makes their bread
&gt; and butter parading their EVP techniques. I witnessed one such expert who we
&gt; all have at least heard of create an EVP. How? The person in question
&gt; scratched their thumb nail against the recorders mic to create a sound. This
&gt; person then played back the recorder to me and pitched it down to make what
&gt; this person say what was heard sound more convincing.
&gt;
&gt; If I made my money parading my EVP ability, I would discredit your box too.
&gt; Why? Because box users are the future of ITC and paranormal research. It is
&gt; relatively cheap, vastly available, and provides instant gratuity when
&gt; operating. Who wants to sit alone in the dark talking to silence when you
&gt; can hear the responses in real time? EVP is still a valid form of
&gt; communication, but ghost boxes threaten an EVP experts way to make money.
&gt; Boxes are being used more and more, especially on the television shows and
&gt; public hunts. This hurts the revenue stream for EVP experts who used to be
&gt; the ones getting invited to guest star on hunts for a fee; they are now
&gt; being replaced by box users.
&gt;
&gt; In short, box use can be discredited by every expert and skeptic in the
&gt; field. It doesn&#x27;t matter. Ghost box use now has its place in paranormal
&gt; culture and it is not going to leave it anytime soon. Being situated in a
&gt; paranormal group that is lead by a para-celebrity has put me in the unique
&gt; position of visiting other groups and working with the other
&gt; para-celebrities in this field quite frequently. I can assure you that ghost
&gt; boxes aren&#x27;t going anywhere because the majority of these people have at
&gt; least a shack hack in their paranormal arsenal.
&gt;
&gt; So let this expert discredit to his or her&#x27;s hearts&#x27; content. When they
&gt; publish their results, the results become public and they are on the hook
&gt; for what they say at that point (which could bite them in the ass one day).
&gt; Their results will not hurt the work that you are doing today Frank, nor
&gt; will what they say influence this forums core group in any way because we
&gt; know the boxes work.

&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s probably not kosher to post this, but I find this highly insulting
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; all of us. As usual, igonore all facts and all other methods, such as
&gt; &gt; EVPmaker, which forms all the voices inside the computer. Ignore all
&gt; phone
&gt; &gt; EVP messages, ignore all voices heard with no electronic aids. Ignore
&gt; &gt; messages received via turned off TV and printers--and on and on, yet they
&gt; &gt; know all about EVP..Ignore the fact that probably thousands use boxes
&gt; &gt; successfully.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &quot;We have conducted a few listening studies of reported radio-sweep EVP
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; the results have not been good. We have also worked with a variety of
&gt; such
&gt; &gt; devices. Based on what we know about trans-etheric influences, how EVP
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; visual forms of ITC are formed and what we know about mediumship, it is
&gt; &gt; difficult to fit radio-sweep into any established hypothesis. Without
&gt; solid
&gt; &gt; research supporting it as producing EVP, it is impossible for us to
&gt; &gt; recommend it or support its use. If there were double-blind studies
&gt; &gt; conducted by experienced researchers that shows it does produce
&gt; phenomena,
&gt; &gt; we would gladly promote it as an alternative technique.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We are pretty sure that, in transform EVP (ordinary recorder), the voice
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; formed in the electronics by transforming available audio-frequency noise
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; an active part of the electronics such as a transistor junction. We think
&gt; &gt; the process is amplification of a weak telekinetic signal via stochastic
&gt; &gt; resonance and we have found that the optimum audio-frequency signal for
&gt; this
&gt; &gt; is a chaotic one rich in voice-frequencies with many transient
&gt; perturbation.
&gt; &gt; That is our working hypothesis. &quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I can&#x27;t say who this is from, cuz almost certain I&#x27;d get sued. There&#x27;s no
&gt; &gt; double blind testing their BS either. Clueless!!

&gt; &gt; &gt; When people start calling themselves experts at something that is not

&gt; &gt; &gt; may never be fully understood the crap gets deep. I love these so
&gt; called
&gt; &gt; &gt; experts that tell us that we can only make contact using their exact
&gt; methods
&gt; &gt; &gt; and we need to refrain from any other way of doing research because in
&gt; their
&gt; &gt; &gt; eyes were just spinning our wheels. So we can&#x27;t get communication from
&gt; &gt; &gt; modified radios and were all just hearing what we want I guess. I have
&gt; heard
&gt; &gt; &gt; it all,,&quot;I wrote a book and im an expert&quot; or &quot;believe me that wont
&gt; work, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; know cause im physic&quot;….in one ear and out the other. Everyone is an
&gt; expert
&gt; &gt; &gt; these days and most of what they say is BS. If I start hearing someone
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt; something talking through my dogs butt guess what im recording it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds like these so called experts are just trying to deter and
&gt; silence
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything they dont agree with by doing there Scientific tests. If it
&gt; works
&gt; &gt; &gt; it works and if it didnt work what the hell are we all still doing

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m sure there will be articles in major paranormal mags proclaiming
&gt; how

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They keep testing and getting nothing, and the rest of us keep
&gt; recording
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and have no shortage of voices that others can hear, can be
&gt; validated,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gives infromation that&#x27;s unknow to the listener. I just posted a
&gt; video
&gt; &gt; &gt; where
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a voice says &quot;I said fuck&quot; just to show it&#x27;s not broadcast frags.
