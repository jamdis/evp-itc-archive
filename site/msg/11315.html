<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve just been so darned busy. :( I&#x27;m trying to get all kinds of  
stuff written so that I can take my annual camping vacation in July  
and actually be away from the magazine for 2 whole weeks. But I was  
really intrigued by what happened the other day. I think Nick and I  
are going to give a go again today, since he&#x27;s now out of school. But  
I can say that 31 seems to like us as adoptive family. ;)

Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve forgotten about you, buddy. Not happening.

&gt; &gt; Sorry to have been so out of the loop. I&#x27;ve had loads of articles
&gt; &gt; due. Rosemary Guiley and I also almost died of heatstroke at a
&gt; show
&gt; &gt; we were both working last weekend. It was over 100 at 10 am. I
&gt; told
&gt; &gt; her I was sorry to meet her looking so disreputable, but
&gt; &gt; circumstances were what they were... Anyway, Rosemary, let&#x27;s try
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; meet up in more civilized circs soon. :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, Frank gifted me box 31 about a month and half ago, and it
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; only been this week that my son and I have been able to A.) Get
&gt; all
&gt; &gt; 18 batteries in the right direction without any falling out ;) ,
&gt; B.)
&gt; &gt; Sit down and see if we could make the connection. Yesterday got it
&gt; &gt; rolling, but first he had to turn on his RS hack and tell them
&gt; about
&gt; &gt; box 31 and that he wanted them to try it. He says almost
&gt; immediately
&gt; &gt; he began hearing Frank&#x27;s name and &quot;purple&quot; through 31.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Frank, I don&#x27;t know what you do, but I swear it&#x27;s like a baby
&gt; taking
&gt; &gt; its first breath or something--the &quot;reflex&quot; of the box seems to be
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; call for you. Even my mini did, remember?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So, we just did a session today. We didn&#x27;t record it, because we
&gt; &gt; didn&#x27;t figure we&#x27;d get much and would fooling about with where to
&gt; &gt; hang the antenna wire and all. But, sure enough, within minutes,
&gt; we
&gt; &gt; were getting responses to our simple questions, hearing the tech
&gt; &gt; words I have become used to, such as &quot;check,&quot; the technician Stu
&gt; said
&gt; &gt; his name, someone called my name, and when I asked if we should
&gt; sign
&gt; &gt; off, someone clearly said, &quot;Yes.&quot; I said &quot;Thank you,&quot; and the
&gt; &gt; immediate response was, &quot;You&#x27;re welcome.&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 31 is very different to my mini--I can see that already. Nick and
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; will keep you posted about our next round of contact.
