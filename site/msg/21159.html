<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Im glad Frank and you Zack have no interest in the dark side. its refreshing to hear you say youve never encountered a demon because its my only hesitation is getting a Frank box and communicating with the spirit world, it fasinates me.

&gt; I have no interest in &quot;demons.&quot; In fact, I wonder if they even really
&gt; exist. I have never encountered one.
&gt; 
&gt; I do have a lot of ghost recordings. So far, all I&#x27;ve gotten indicate
&gt; they are/were just people like you and me.

&gt; &gt; That can not possibly get any further away from spirit, and what spirit
&gt; &gt; communication really is, and what it is for. You all can follow the childish
&gt; &gt; crap is ya want, but I will not particapate. I will not make anymore boxes
&gt; &gt; for people that want to run around in the dark chasing evil, and trying to
&gt; &gt; get a fear rush going.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Already dumped one group this week, I can dump this one too. Y&#x27;all can&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; hear one freaking thing I say anyway.
