I am an actual &quot;card \ncarryi=\r\nng Scientist&quot; myself (no PhD yet)  I have KNOWN this stuff was real \never s=\r\nince I was a kid.  You can STILL be a real Scientist and accept the \nparano=\r\nrmal though.  &quot;the unknown&quot; only upsets frightened, insecure people \nwith n=\r\no desire to learn anything new. \n\n Being a &quot;Scientist&quot; with no drive or des=\r\nire to learn something new and \nprofound about the nature of the universe i=\r\ns like being an &quot;explorer&quot; who \nnever goes out  of his front door.  We have=\r\n a LOT of people who call \nthemselves &quot;Scientists&quot; who are just like that--=\r\n--  Mere &quot;Tech&#39;s&quot;, \nactually who USE currently accepted science in their wo=\r\nrk, but NEVER \ndiscover anything new beyond some extra decimal points or a =\r\nsubspecies of \nclam. \n\n  I, on the otherhand, am fascinated with the Parano=\r\nrmal---after all, \nParanormal is only those aspects of nature and reality t=\r\nhat we do not \nunderstand yet.  History shows us that anything that mankind=\r\n did not know \nabout, was once considered &quot;Paranormal&quot; or &quot;supernatural&quot;.  =\r\nLightning, for \nexample, was once thought of as supernatural &quot;bolts from Ze=\r\nus&quot; or &quot;the \nwrath of God&quot;.  Once Ben Franklin got a handle on it though, i=\r\nt became \nde-mystified and became normal science of the day.  I feel that o=\r\nne day, \nwhat we call &quot;Ghosts&quot; Spirits&quot; and parallel worlds, etc will one d=\r\nay \nbecome part of &quot;conventional science&quot; and lead to new technologies, jus=\r\nt \nas electricity has.\nThis will open the way to faster than light space tr=\r\navel, teleportation, \ntime travel, direct contact with aliens and the so ca=\r\nlled &quot;dead&quot; \netc.--Hell yes! its worth studying. \n\n\nTime and energy should =\r\nnot be wasted arguing to &quot;Pseudo Skeptics&quot; who have \nemotional issues with =\r\nany thing they do not know about.\nREAL Science involves a methodical approa=\r\nch to problems and mysteries, \nScience keeps us from becoming the excited, =\r\nemotional  &quot;Flakes&quot; who will \nbelieve ANYTHING on an emotional basis (the e=\r\nxact opposite of Pseudo \nSkeptics)  Neither Flakes nor Pseudo Skeptics use =\r\nReal Science  They base \ntheir assertions on emotions rather than experienc=\r\ne and experimentation. \nYa gotta be &quot;Skeptical&quot; but not take it too far.  D=\r\non&#39;t dismiss the fact \nthat &quot;something is there&quot;, simply because you don&#39;t =\r\nlike the folk tale \nexplanation of it.---Find out what&#39;s really going on.  =\r\nThat&#39;s the key to \n&quot;balanced research&quot;.  What is generally considered &quot;The =\r\ntruth&quot; changes \nover time with new knowledge.
