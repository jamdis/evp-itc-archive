<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have a puck, and I have been getting the name Seth too.  I also have had
my puck give words that are not on the list.

&gt; I&#x27;m new here, but have been into paranormal research for 6 years now.
&gt; I am the type of person that never gets EVP voices with a recorder so
&gt; I thought I would experiment with things like the Frank&#x27;s box and
&gt; Ovilus. I recently got the ovilus and brought it to a cemetery and
&gt; field where a church burned down many years ago. I can not get too
&gt; specific without having people thinking I am making stuff up but it
&gt; got fairly wild towards the end of the session. For most of the time
&gt; we were there the Ovilus seemed to be spitting out a lot of random
&gt; stuff but it kept mentioning the name Seth. After we moved over to the
&gt; field where the church was, the ovilus got a lot more active and
&gt; started saying relevant words like cross and priest. The Ovilus was
&gt; MUCH more active when being used by our female member. Towards the end
&gt; the Ovilus said I am Seth, and the woman that was with me told Seth
&gt; that she did not want to talk to you I&#x27;ve heard bad things about you.
&gt; After that the Ovilus said rather nasty things to her and she started
&gt; feeling nauseous and she ripped the headphones off her head. Needless
&gt; to say we ended the session and got out of there.
&gt;
&gt; Over the course of our investigation we found that the Ovilus was
&gt; saying many words that are not on the 500 word list, so yesterday I
&gt; did some test recordings to see what words would come up and one of
&gt; the first things that came up was: seth  blamed  rest   I am   not
&gt; gare   demon (all in that order). Needless to say this has me
&gt; concerned that whatever seth is is still with the box so I am not even
&gt; storing this thing inside of my house. I have an MP3 of the ovilus
&gt; saying this.
&gt;
&gt; Also from my experience about 50% of the words it is saying aren&#x27;t on
&gt; the list. Chris Fleming has been getting words not on the list, and
&gt; Barry FitzGerald has stated that just over 50% of the words he is
&gt; getting are not on the list. Is there really a much larger list than
&gt; advertised or is this thing really magic? Highly doubtful IMO.
&gt;
&gt; My most important question is is anyone else getting the name Seth out
&gt; of the Ovilus? How many people use this device here?
