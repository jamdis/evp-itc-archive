No, I'll post it here. It's =

They have reeked havoc with a fe=

Everything from serious poltergeist activity to=

hem. They come through all things electrical and love radios. Which is prob=
ably why Frank gets them every so often.=A0


They're the types to tell peo=
ple to kill their family members and all sorts of weird crap. They get a hu=
