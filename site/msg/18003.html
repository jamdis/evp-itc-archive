For this first

As to your comment on the audio

        to include the audio.=C2=A0 Maybe that is still a good idea.=C2=

This seemed liked a rabbit hole, and I'm no=

        handle it. So for this trial, I figured we'd just no=
t go there, and 
        require replies only be valid if they are given du=

        specified time frame. Once the actual object =

But yeah, we need to see

      =
    
          Since we're talking about experiments and protocols here are=
 some 
          ideas to improve
          the protocol RJ suggested initi=
ally. Using a test target is one 
          way of establishing a 
        =
  truth in time, which is the basis of this experiment. But there 
        =
  are a couple of issues.
          =C2=A0
          It is quite possible t=
hat someone could discern the target 
          through remote viewing alon=
e.
          This would negate the need for involvement of a spirit 
      =
    communicator or discarnate entity.
          Outcomes=C2=A0depend on th=
e word of those reporting. The true 
          skeptic (not cynic) would 
 =
         therefore say that this experiment contains a basic flaw in that 
=
          it=C2=A0does not uniquely 
          indicate that the informatio=
n was obtained in the prescribed 
          manner. Providing access
      =
    to the raw audio file would not necessarily constitute proof 
         =
 either, since many of these 
          communications can only be heard by=
 certain people, 
          =C2=A0
          If the audio file were quite c=
lear, timing=C2=A0=C2=A0becomes an 
          issue. In other words, when w=
as 
          the audio actually recorded?=C2=A0 This issue can be mitigate=
d 
          simply by requiring any
          claimant to email the audio =
file to a trusted party before the 
          test ends. It would be best 
=
          if the trusted party were not otherwise involved in the 
        =
  experiment and it was=C2=A0 their duty 
          simply to=C2=A0collect =
the claims. Once all claims had been 
          collected they could be pos=
ted 
          publicly for review=C2=A0by the community in general.=C2=A0 =
The 
          experimenter could decide if any 
          of the claims se=
emed to have hit,=C2=A0and this decision could be 
          reviewed by an=
yone if desired. 
          =C2=A0
          The important detail however i=
s that this experiment does not 
          completely answer the 
         =
 question. It is a first attempt and certainly can be improved on 
        =
  successive trials.
          =C2=A0
          Successive trials are alway=
s a good idea, since it provides 
          replication. And it would be
  =
        best if others replicated the experiment using a very similar 
    =
      protocol. If these were to
          succeed, the community could the=
n state that out of X trials Y 
          had succeeded (by 
          some=
 definition of success) potentially=C2=A0giving a success 
          rate a=
bove that expected 
          by random chance. This would make the outcome=
 quantifiable and 
          measureable 
          and thus meaningful.
  =
        =C2=A0
          But also important to note, this would only prove =
the potential 
          veracity of the messages.
          It would not (=
and cannot as far as I can tell) prove the origin 
          of the message=
s. This detail
          will, I fear, remain a matter for belief and specu=
lation for 
          quite some time to come.
