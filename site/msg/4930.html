<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for the explanation, Zack!  Yes, a chip that&#x27;s already been 
coded to perform this function would be certainly be a fine find!  In 
the meantime, I&#x27;m going to add some white-pink noise to the mix to 
see if I can muffle some of the snippets of radio broadcast voices 
that comes through ...

&gt; The chip is a microcontroller.  It needs a program 
called &quot;firmware&quot; put 
&gt; into it before it will do anything useful.  The chips have a 
program 
&gt; memory which comes blank when you buy them.
&gt; 
&gt; The &quot;code&quot; is the representation of what is called machine language 
&gt; that tells the various parts of the microcontroller what to do.  In 
this 
&gt; case, I imagine it increases a voltage with a certain pattern and 
then 
&gt; drops it down to zero, starting over again and repeating at a 
certain 
&gt; rate. This would produce a repetitive sweep of the radio at a 
certain rate 
&gt; when the microcontroller is hooked up to the radio correctly.
&gt; 
&gt; It wouldn&#x27;t be difficult for me to write my own program to do this 
with a 
&gt; PIC microcontroller, but if someone else has already done it, why 
bother?
&gt; 
&gt; If I can&#x27;t get my hands on the machine code, I&#x27;ll write some myself.

&gt; &gt; Frank, please let me know if you should, for whatever reason, 
decide
&gt; &gt; to sell that chip (to control the scan rate of the &#x27;469).  I&#x27;d 
like
&gt; &gt; to purchase it from you, if possible.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,

&gt; &gt; P.S.  I&#x27;ve read the follow-ups to my initial question and being a
&gt; &gt; layman at modifying electric apparatuses, what do you all mean by
&gt; &gt; code?  Does one need the code and the chip in order to speed up 
the
&gt; &gt; scanning on a hacked &#x27;469; or can one do it with simply a code, or
&gt; &gt; the chip, alone?

&gt; &gt;&gt;  Yeah, the guy that first made the hack was giving away a chip to
&gt; &gt; control the scan rate. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still available. I 
have
&gt; &gt; one of the chips, and no &#x27;469.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m still relatively new to building boxes and would like to know
&gt; &gt; if it&#x27;s possible to speed up the scanning a bit on a hacked RS 12-
&gt; &gt; 469. Thanks,Sharon --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption

&gt; &gt; problem with noise reduction methods, they tend to take out 
voices. I
&gt; &gt; think if I used the muffled sound consistently they would talk
&gt; &gt; through it though, the goal being to get higher level voices, and
&gt; &gt; audio. The clarifier is just a low pass filter that can be 
adjusted--
&gt; &gt; just an idea.&gt; I have some female guides that speak sometimes, and
&gt; &gt; there&#x27;s the seven sisters that come though sometimes, but I don&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; know much about that. &gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@: debbie@:

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Frank, Thanks for the extra instructions, it doesn&#x27;t sound too
&gt; &gt; difficult for me so I&#x27;ll give it a shot. &gt; &gt; By the way, I did 
listen
&gt; &gt; to your tone control clip. Since I&#x27;m new to this my comments are
&gt; &gt; probably not &quot;worth&quot; much at this point. I thought the entire clip
&gt; &gt; itself was a lot smoother and clearer than most I&#x27;ve heard so far
&gt; &gt; from various sources (the mixed station sounds are in smaller 
pieces
&gt; &gt; so for someone like me it would be easier to pick out the EVPs as
&gt; &gt; opposed to entire words from radio announcers). The short piece 
about
&gt; &gt; 2/3 of the way through, where I&#x27;m guessing you used a clarifier,
&gt; &gt; sounded muffled to me, which makes me think it would also muffle 
the
&gt; &gt; EVPs. Definitely easier on the ears but for someone inexperienced
&gt; &gt; (and I seem to be the only one here!) it seems it would be harder 
to
&gt; &gt; pick out the real words too.&gt; &gt; By the way, in listening to the
&gt; &gt; deluge of clips uploaded last night, I can&#x27;t help but notice that 
the
&gt; &gt; voices are all men. Just curious -- is that always the case?&gt; &gt; &gt;
