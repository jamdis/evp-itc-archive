       I don't believe in trapped/lost souls, I think that's Hollywo=
od. The trouble with doing investigations, I think, is you get the evidence=
 you expect to get, so it will tend to support the concept of stuck souls. =
When I record it supports my concept of sprits travel, and hauntings are fo=
