This is about how to correctly and fairly moderate a \nlist.\n&gt; \n&gt; If this was the wild west, things would have transpired something \nlike\n&gt; this:\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce stood in the public street and offered a completely legitimate\n&gt; exchange with the townsfolk.\n&gt; \n&gt; Laura walked out of the saloon and took a shot at Bruce and at the\n&gt; window of Frank S&#39;s telegraph office.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce shot back at Laura.\n&gt; \n&gt; Johnny Marlboro stepped out onto the balcony of the Imperial hotel \nand\n&gt; took a shot a Bruce.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce shot back.\n&gt; \n&gt; Laura pulled out a deputy&#39;s badge, stuck it to her lapel, and shot\n&gt; Bruce dead.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann ran out into the street and said, &quot;Don&#39;t you think there&#39;s a\n&gt; problem here? Maybe the sheriff needs to step in,&quot; to which Laura,\n&gt; acting under the color of law, replied that if Ann didn&#39;t like it \nshe\n&gt; could leave town and if she stayed she better not question authority\n&gt; again. \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s what happened here.

I sit idly by and watch 200+ people get bad \n&gt; &gt; information on a daily basis, which hurts any good research.  The \n&gt; &gt; best way to go about what we are doing is to come up with our own \n&gt; &gt; theories and post them as examples for others to read.  We \nshouldn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; have anybody dictate every aspect of this as fact.  If anybody \ncan \n&gt; &gt; give information on box use it would be Frank, who nobody who \nowns \n&gt; &gt; boxes has listened to...myself included.  He knows how they work \nand \n&gt; &gt; offers a great amount of knowledge to this subject or else none \nof us \n&gt; &gt; would even be here.  This board has started to be a dictatorship \nof \n&gt; &gt; one persons opinion and if nobody listened...they were wrong.  \nAnd to \n&gt; &gt; me, that&#39;s wrong.  I started out with Joe&#39;s box and moved forward \nand \n&gt; &gt; nobody helped me in my path.  I since aquired other boxes and \ntaught \n&gt; &gt; myself them as well, which means it can be done.  People...do \nyour \n&gt; &gt; own thing and get results the best way you can and learn from \nyour \n&gt; &gt; mistakes, that&#39;s what i did.  And getting Bruce his first Joe&#39;s \nbox \n&gt; &gt; and Frank&#39;s box and getting him started in box research, i \nsomewhat \n&gt; &gt; feel responsible for what transpired on this board and i \napologize to \n&gt; &gt; those involved.  Frank, i&#39;m sorry that another person has taken \nyour \n&gt; &gt; box and claimed to know all and not listening to what you adhere \nwe \n&gt; &gt; do.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nuff Said,\n&gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With all due respect, I am going to put my 2 bits in on this.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I love the sharing of info, but have elected to post less and \n&gt; &gt; retire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to reading more. :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; That said, I must agree with Ann that the initial post, though \n&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps posted to be humorous, came off as disrespectful (in my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion as a reader looking in on this forum) not only to BH \nbut to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; FS.
