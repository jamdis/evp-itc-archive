Other than various claims, there is no evidence that anything will happen i=
n=A0 2012: it will be the same as every other end-of-world prediction made =
before.

Then someone will "recalculate", or proclaim a new EVP message, an=
d point at 2013!=A0 Or 2014!=A0 

However, I really do like it when people =
pick specific dates for predictions.=A0 Besides being entertaining, it give=
s everyone a chance to judge for themselves just how much the predictor is =
like all the others who have marched around carrying=A0 those "THE END OF T=
HE WORLD IS NIGH" signs.=A0 Full of nothing but themselves and their=A0 del=
usions.
