More infor=
mation about the NJ Devil:


The Jersey Devil is a legendary creature or cr=
yptid said to inhabit the Pine Barrens of Southern New Jersey. The creature=
 is often described as a flying biped with hooves, but there are many varia=
tions. The Jersey Devil has worked its way into the pop culture of the area=
, even lending its name to New Jersey's team in the National Hockey League.=



Legends and reported encounters:


Most accounts of the Jersey Devil leg=
end attribute the creature to a "Mother Leeds", a supposed whore although t=
he tale has many variations. According to one version, she invoked the devi=
l by saying "let it be the devil" while giving birth to her 13th child, and=
 when the baby was born, it either immediately or soon afterward transforme=
d into a devil like creature and flew off into the surrounding pines. The c=
hild was born with horns, a tail, wings, and a horse-like head. The creatur=
e revisited Mrs. Leeds every day. She stood at her door and told it to leav=
e. After awhile, the creature got the hint and never returned. 
According t=
o legend, while visiting the Hanover Mill Works to inspect his cannonballs =
being forged, Commodore Stephen Decatur sighted a flying creature flapping =
its wings and fired a cannonball directly upon it to no effect. Joseph Bona=
parte, eldest brother of Emperor Napoleon, is also said to have witnessed t=
he Jersey Devil while hunting on his Bordentown, New Jersey estate around 1=
820. Throughout the 19th century, the Jersey Devil was blamed for livestock=
 killings, strange tracks, and reported sounds. In the early 20th century, =
a number of people in New Jersey and neighboring states claimed to witness =
the Jersey Devil or see its tracks. Claims of a corpse matching the Jersey =
Devil's description arose in 1957. In 1960, the merchants around Camden off=
ered a $10,000 reward for the capture of the Jersey Devil, even offering to=
 build a private zoo to house the creature if captured.
There are many othe=
r versions of the legend. The legends say it was the 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, =
or 13th child, It was born normal or deformed, and the mother confined it t=
o the cellar or the attic. Although there are many discrepancies in all of =
these stories, there are 3 pieces of evidence that tie all of the legends o=
f the Jersey Devil's origin together. From the pre 1909 era, few documented=
 records of sightings still exist. The ones that do, confirm the existence =
of the devil.
