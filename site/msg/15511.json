You guide may be Princess Kira, I would bet she lived one \n&gt;  time, you could do a search for her, or you might ask my guide Lydia to \n&gt; help you  identify her for you.  Lydia recently came through for me over the  \n&gt; radio(box), and she even responded to Sharon over her box, Sharon was really \n&gt;  surprised I guess, I could hear Lydia say, after Sharon asked for her, my \n&gt; Lydia  said &quot;if your good&quot; in other words, Sharon must get naughty \n&gt; sometimes, so Lydia  wanted her to be good, then she would come through.  The last \n&gt; time I heard  Lydia&#39;s voice was back in 1974 I am so happy to hear from her \n&gt; again.   Purple is also the color of my main guide&#39;s robes, she lived long, \n&gt; long ago, she  came from what is now Turkey, she was a rich well to do \n&gt; business lady in her  day, and made and sold purple garment&#39;s  to the rich, she \n&gt; always wears  purple robes herself, and is known as the purple lady, she was/is \n&gt; a healer, and  she and her entire household became Christian, she used to \n&gt; allow Peter and Paul  and other&#39;s to hold secret meetings at her home when \n&gt; they were in her  area.  She got the purple dye from shell fishes off the \n&gt; Mediterranean  sea coasts, had vats of purple dye, and produced the purple color \n&gt; in  clothing.  She recently came through for me, she comes from the highest \n&gt;  Heaven, I knew her voice right away, so I know this is real.  Here are a  \n&gt; couple of her recordings of Lydia, she is my &quot;main control,&quot; guide and has \n&gt; been  with me all my life, and came up with a few of my ancestors as well.   \n&gt; Bonnie\n&gt; In the first one Sharon is asking at my request for Lydia to come forward,  \n&gt; she says her name loud and clear, then I ask her to give me her identifying \n&gt;  color, she says, &quot;purple.&quot;  I don&#39;t know what type of box Sharon was \n&gt; using,  but rest assured it was not a radio, must have been a Franks or a Joe&#39;s  \n&gt; model.  She does come through on my little radio sometimes, but she is very  \n&gt; busy, and had to come a long way into this heavy atmosphere, she is always  \n&gt; working over there, nice lady, and I am blessed to have her as my main \n&gt; guide.In  this last one with Sharon, Lydia has someone say for her, &quot;be good and \n&gt; we will&quot;  for her to come through, and speak to Sharon as Sharon asked her \n&gt; to come through  for me &lt;g&gt; and she did.  One of these days, I will buy a \n&gt; radio from  you when i get some extra cash, I think that if you use silver for \n&gt; the wires you  may get better contact, but i could be wrong, what do i \n&gt; know?

They call me purple, and that&#39;s a catholic \n&gt; thing.  Catholic it the only religion they mention. &#39;course they also call me a \n&gt; girl!  Purple Princess Kiera, it&#39;s pronounced a little different than  Kira.\n&gt; \n&gt; the different boxes give different results for me, and whether  it&#39;s \n&gt; randiom of linear sweep.

I \n&gt; &gt; was once  listening to yahoo chat where someone was giving their idea of \n&gt; &gt;  Scripture, and the religion they belonged to, which had certain beliefs, \n&gt; that  \n&gt; &gt; I did not agree with, I feel asleep, and I heard a very distinct  voice \n&gt; come \n&gt; &gt; into my right ear saying, &quot;Bonnie, I will teach you the  Bible&quot; guess \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; person didn&#39;t want me to listen to that person  anymore thought I&#39;d be \n&gt; led \n&gt; &gt; astray or something. But, little do they  realize my conviction is so \n&gt; &gt; strong, it will never brake down, sure I  get upset sometimes when things \n&gt; don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; always go my way, but nothing  can take what I know away that is, what I \n&gt; know \n&gt; &gt; to be true. It&#39;s all a  matter of perception, that is so, but in one way \n&gt; &gt; or another we are  all shown at some point, that there really is a &quot;Prime \n&gt; &gt; Mover,&quot; and  there really is no death, it&#39;s only becoming unwired from \n&gt; our \n&gt; &gt;  physical body, and going home. Bonnie\n&gt; &gt; Here are a couple more  files,\n&gt; &gt; One is of a couple fella&#39;s name&#39;s, and the other one is telling  me I \n&gt; guess \n&gt; &gt; to get use to feeling tired, geez great! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In a message dated 7/28/2009 12:26:30 P.M.

They were asking for you,  this was a few \n&gt; &gt; days \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ago, over my radio the RS  20-125 they sound very clear to me, didn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; say \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  what they wanted maybe I can go through the recording, and see what \n&gt; &gt;  else \n&gt; &gt; &gt; they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are saying. They like to watch  baseball sometimes on my big screen, \n&gt; &gt; had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; whole group of them here last weekend, for fun I asked them where  \n&gt; they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; were \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the house, they said &quot;all  around&quot; and &quot;4 are sitting on the \n&gt; floor,&quot; \n&gt; &gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said,  well I must walk right through you people then, they said \n&gt; &quot;yes&quot; \n&gt; &gt; I  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked them if they felt any sensation, they said they do  feel when \n&gt; we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; walk \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through them. I always ask  them if they want football or baseball, \n&gt; &gt; they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; say  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;baseball&quot; I had one spirit fella here routing for Seattle,  it was \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tigers _Mariners game, since I&#39;m not much into  sports, I wasn&#39;t \n&gt; really \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sure if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was a  rerun or not, but they seemed to be happy, when I went into \n&gt; &gt; my  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; room to work, I could hear them in the front room chatting  amongst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves. Sometimes it&#39;s neat to have company out  here, and I \n&gt; don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; even have to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feed them.  Would you know anything about who the fella is in the \n&gt; &gt; second \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; one? He is saying &quot;save a company.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bonnie\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; ************ ************&lt;WBR&gt;**An Excellent Credit Score  is 750. \n&gt; See \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Steps! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; (___http://pr.atwola.http://pr.http://pr.atwohttp://pr.atwolhttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.http://pr.ahttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.atwolahttp&__ \n&gt; (http://pr.atwola.http//pr.http://prhttp://pr.atwolhttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.http://pr.ah\n&gt; ttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr&_)   \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; (_http://pr.atwola.http://prhttp://prhttp://pr.atwolhttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.http://pr.ahtt_ \n&gt; (http://pr.atwola.http//pr.atwhttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.http://pr.ahttp://p) \n&gt; &gt;  _r.atwolahttp:r.atwolahttp:&lt;WBr.atwolah&_ \n&gt; (r.atwolahttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.atwo&) )  &lt;WBR&gt;hmpg&&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WB\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; (__http://pr.atwola.http://pr.http://prhttp://pr.atwolhttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.http://pr.ahttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr&_ \n&gt; (http://pr.atwola.http//pr.atwhttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.http://pr.ahttp://\n&gt; pr.atwolahttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.atwo&) &lt;WBR&gt;hmpg&&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WB\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; (_http://pr.atwola.http://pr.atwhttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.http://pr.ahttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.atwolahttp://pr.atwo&&lt;WBR&gt;hmpg&&lt;WBR&gt;bc_\n&gt;  \n&gt; (http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100126575x1221823322x1201398723/aol?redir=http://www.freecreditreport.com/pm/default.aspx?sc=668072&hmpgID=62&bcd=Jul) \n&gt; )  \n&gt; &gt; ) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yExcfooterNO62)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  ************ ************&lt;WBR&gt;**A bad cr& below.
