<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>the ghost thing never seems to go anywhere, anyway, probably because 
the real ones usually move on to other realms pretty quickly.  whats 
left are mostly the lowlevel fakes that only want to waste your time.

but , there are other and better possibilities.

&gt; Just FYI. I am no longer connected to Haunted Times in any way, 
except Chris 
&gt; Moon can keep and use the Ghost Boxes he has, I won&#x27;t be supplying 
anymore.  
&gt; I very much dislike the concept, and activity of &quot;ghost huning&quot;, 
there too 
&gt; many egos, associated wiht it, to many that think they are the 
worlds only 
&gt; paranoramal experts, and way too much focus on the negative, 
and &quot;scary&quot; 
&gt; aspects.  My systems are not designed for that ....stuff, and I 
can&#x27;t 
&gt; support those activities, even it means that I don&#x27;t personaly put 
any more 
&gt; of my boxes out there in the public. The information for making 
this stuff 
&gt; is out there, and others can build this stuff, and do whatever they 
want 
&gt; with it. I doubt if there will be many &quot;Frank&#x27;s Box&quot; clones out 
there, while 
&gt; the circuits are straight forward, it takes the &quot;certain 
understanding&quot; to 
&gt; get it to work.
