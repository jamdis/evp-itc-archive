LOL yeah that one took a moment to notice I tried making the word article complete I thought oh its missing the "e" that didnt work LOL so then i went back and noticed the period on the end. 
   
  Great work though I didn't get a chance to make a long post on that as I was late for work. You do very nice work. It was very detailed.  It is nice that finally some people look at it from Franks perspective, many have experienced his work but few get to know the man befind the the scenes or see the unbelievable lengths he goes to to work on these and ask nothing in return. 
   
  I personally want to say I have known Frank privately for years now and I dont know anyone more dedicated...yeah a few of us come close but most do not have constant scrutiny, attacks from all sides, and words put into thier mouth. 
   
  He is a tough guy, and I owe ya a personal thank you again Sumption. Not for any boxes you made or for any of the great ideas you gave and not for answering about a jillion technical 'evp word' questions that I couldnt understand. Just for being a friend. You are a great friend Frank!

          Thanks for the feedback everyone! I'll be interested to see what 
rolls in through the TAPS magazine. The issue will be featured next 
weekend at the next Ghost Hunters haunted event, at Eastern State 
Penitentiary in Philly. People will be getting it, and it's sure to 
generate some converation. (Bill, Randy & I will be there). BTW, 
Randy alerted me that the hot link for the pdf includes a period 
which makes it not work, and I don't know how to edit the original 
post, so I would suggest highlighting & cutting the period out. My 
apologies. I fixed it on itcbridge.com under Forum/EVP/Ghost Box.
