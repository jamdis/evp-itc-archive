Babs, lol, I use to hate that ticking noise on the am, but I got use to it!  Good luck, you will soon be able to turn it out.  The 470 doesn;t have the ticking and the speakers are built in.  Joel uses the 470 more than I do. The 469 I consider MY BOX, lol use I'm attached to it just a little more than he is.

Steve, hope your holidays were wonderful. We haven't had the chance to
speak in a few weeks.
What are the difference in the 469 and the 470 besides 2 channel vs.
4? You are still choosing one channel and it is still a linear sweep
right? Technically, what would be the difference in choosing AM on the
469 and AM on the 470? The pulsing sound is absolutely annoying.
