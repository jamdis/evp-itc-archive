<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ann,

Thank you for your reply. I honestly appreciate your views and the
obvious thought put into your reply. 

You are right, there is no harmony meter, no dark-guy scale, no way to
effectively measure anything. What we do know, is that the &quot;dark-guys&quot;
do come through. Something happens that enable them as well as the
&quot;light-guys&quot; to speak to us in real time. As of yet, we are unable to
claim with any certainty the possible effects of either on our world.

I also agree that it is possible that they communicate through classic
EVP as well. However, the communication is not in real time and to the
best of my knowledge a give and take conversation rarely occurs. With
the communication capable of coming through the box, a relationship
begins to form. A trust that when one turns on the box, he/she will be
spoken to and be able to speak back in return. It is common belief
that the &quot;dark-guys&quot; can be quite deceitful. Why is that? Why not just
announce that they are the bad guys? There is a motive and intention
to disguise who they are. What are they capable of? We simply can not
say with any certainty.

I also can not say with any certainty that a portal can be opened. No
one can say that one can not be opened. I for one am not comfortable
with the &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude. I definitely see the positive
possibilities from any sort of EVP. However, I see the enormous
potential for negative. Enormous. To not see that is, IMO, short-sighted.

&gt; My thoughts:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; From: babiarz3@...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I ask you to consider the fact that many who purchase the mini-box
&gt; &gt; will not be of the right frame of mind. Most will not be in harmony.
&gt; &gt; Many will take &quot;the dark guys&quot; seriously. Yet, you feel it&#x27;s a good
&gt; &gt; idea to let anyone who wants a box have one? All in the name of
&gt; &gt; sharing technology.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; There is no such thing as a Harmony meter. There is no such thing as  
&gt; a Dark Guy meter, nor an authorized comparative scale for the effects  
&gt; of &quot;Dark Guys&quot; on people who are not &quot;In Harmony.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Honestly, what does In Harmony actual mean? Okay to play in the club  
&gt; as per Raudive and Technician? How about Edison or Tesla? Or how  
&gt; about not barking mad? Slightly depressed? Having a bad hair day? Not  
&gt; a practicing &quot;fill-in-the-blank?&quot; And who is a Dark Guy? A dead human  
&gt; with a bad attitude, a hellspawn demon, an alien, or nothing at all  
&gt; except the accidental radio broadcast fragment?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Realize that I
&gt; &gt; am not being selfish- I do not own a box. EVP is my passion and has
&gt; &gt; been from day one 6 years ago when I jumped fully into the field. I am
&gt; &gt; successful in capturing EVP, always have been. I still do it the &quot;old
&gt; &gt; fashioned way&quot; with open air techniques.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you have similar concerns about your recorder? Isn&#x27;t it also  
&gt; capable of allowing the Dark Guys to interface with living humans?  
&gt; Shouldn&#x27;t the technology that was and is freely available to do  
&gt; classic EVP have been and be vetted by an august body that would  
&gt; study potential tapers against EVP&#x27;s potential side effects,  
&gt; including measuring them on the scale of Dark guys/In Harmony?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Would I love to be able to
&gt; &gt; hold real time 2 way communications with the other side? Of course.
&gt; &gt; However, I do not think enough research into the possibilities has
&gt; &gt; been done to warrant the approval let alone production of these boxes.
&gt; 
&gt; Again I have to ask: what kind of research and by who?
&gt; 
&gt; There is nothing exotic about the electronics of the box itself. It  
&gt; can&#x27;t *physically* hurt a person more than an a portable radio can--  
&gt; and yearly few people die or are injured at the hands of  their  
&gt; portable radios. What&#x27;s left, and what it seems you&#x27;re fearful of, is  
&gt; potential psychic injury by the box rather than plain old blunt-force  
&gt; trauma. I would submit that diagnosing psychic injury is not anymore  
&gt; possible than diagnosing Harmony. And what it comes down to is that  
&gt; the only people who can make up the body that researches and judges  
&gt; whether the box should be approved are the very people who are using  
&gt; it right now.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Those of us who have been on countless investigations with many people
&gt; &gt; will quickly admit that there are some people we&#x27;d rather not
&gt; &gt; investigate with. When they are present, negative things tend to
&gt; &gt; happen. We all know one or two people who we can say &quot;felt dark&quot; from
&gt; &gt; the first meeting.
&gt; 
&gt; So, you move away from those people because you don&#x27;t like their  
&gt; vibe. You drop them from the investigation team or join a new team or  
&gt; investigate on your own, don&#x27;t you? But you don&#x27;t stop investigating  
&gt; all together. Because you have a subjective feeling about someone is  
&gt; not evidence that they are &quot;dark&quot; and shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to have a  
&gt; simple piece of electronic equipment.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; We all admit that being mentally sound is an
&gt; &gt; important quality in this field. If you have mental issues, this may
&gt; &gt; not be the area of research for you.
&gt; 
&gt; While I agree with out on this point, it is also wonderfully true of  
&gt; all careers, avocations, and hobbies, not just EVP research. If you  
&gt; are nuts, you are going to act nuts in whatever activity or process  
&gt; you&#x27;re involved in. Unless your behavior crosses the line to  
&gt; criminal, the rest of us have to deal with you in the traditional  
&gt; away--avoidance. The only way that an out-of-Harmony type person can  
&gt; hurt anyone else with a box is to hit them over the head with it,  
&gt; electrocute them with it, scare them with it, or attempt somehow to  
&gt; gain sway over them with it. All that they can do to themselves by  
&gt; using it is hit themselves over the head with it, electrocute  
&gt; themselves with it, scare themselves with it, or use it to bolster  
&gt; whatever neuroses or psychopathies they have. And while that is  
&gt; unfortunate, it is also true of everything from revival meetings to  
&gt; household appliances.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; We don&#x27;t bring children on
&gt; &gt; investigations for obvious reasons. BUT! If you want a box that could
&gt; &gt; possibly open up a portal and bridge the gap between here and the
&gt; &gt; dark, sure! Anyone who wants one should have it!
&gt; 
&gt; Wait--how do you know that when you use the box it opens a  
&gt; &quot;portal&quot; (implying that something can come through into the physical  
&gt; space where you are located) versus simply communicate over an  
&gt; electronic device that tunes into frequencies that other phones  
&gt; can&#x27;t? I&#x27;ve seen absolutely no evidence that anything can slither  
&gt; through open cassette, reel-to-reel, digital, or box-induced doorways  
&gt; to torment us. The person on the other end of a phone conversation,  
&gt; no matter how evil, cannot undulate his way through the fiber optics  
&gt; to axe murder us. We know that and we simply hang up and cut off the  
&gt; conversation. If he calls back, we hang up again. While sometimes we  
&gt; get EVPs that are rude, nasty, or mean, I think that 30 years of  
&gt; research has shown us that whoever said, &quot;Screw you,&quot; on your tape  
&gt; recorder is not also capable of slashing your tires. All they can do  
&gt; is frighten you. That may be unpleasant, but it is this internal  
&gt; biochemical process of your own body that leaves most lingering  
&gt; effects, HMO.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You might feel that I am over reacting or being overly dramatic.
&gt; &gt; That&#x27;s fine. My concern is not what you think of me but that you
&gt; &gt; consider the possibilities here. Many of which we do not know. Can you
&gt; &gt; be 100% sure that this is a good idea or that it&#x27;s worthy of saying
&gt; &gt; &quot;well, we&#x27;ll see what happens&quot;?
&gt; 
&gt; The question that I have for you is have you considered the enormous  
&gt; amount of good that comes from use of the box or any EVP technique?  
&gt; For every person who scares herself silly there at least a dozen, in  
&gt; my opinion, who lose their fear of death. For every person who goes  
&gt; on a power trip because they can contact spirits, there are a dozen  
&gt; who share messages of hope all comers. The subjective evidence for  
&gt; positive outcome outweighs the subjective evidence for negative  
&gt; outcomes.
&gt; 
&gt; HMO and YMMV,
&gt; 
&gt; Ann
