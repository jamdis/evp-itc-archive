Well steve, 
 
you need to remember I was around when the halloween incide=
nt took place
I just did not want the research to take another blow. But wh=
at you are planning I think 
is a good thing to offer new individuals the o=
pportunity to get involved.
 
Not that you owe me or anyone an explination =
but I thank you for that one.

EVP-ITC] Re: File from tonight




I appreciate the concern, however i have=
 learned from the past experience. I was going to go and do a brief backgro=
und on my limited time so far in ITC and box research and maybe turn the di=
fferent devices on for those to hear how each one sounds. I probably wasn't=
 going to ask questions due to the halloween event when i received no spiri=
tual contacts, but that wasn't a meeting either where i could explain what =
i was doing. I also am going to bring the 4 spare hacked 470 radios i have =
to offer to potential future researchers. Nothing is etched in stone yet wi=
th me going, i have to contact them first and see if that's what they want.=
 I was supposed to go in November, but declined because i wasn't ready to d=
isplay yet. Now, there is so many different radios out there that i can off=
er the idea for those who wish to approach this research with an open mind.=
