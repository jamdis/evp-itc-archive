&gt; Just picked up and modified the RS 20-125. Before I gave it a test
&gt; run, I made it clear I was only doing a test and that I did not intend
&gt; to make any contact. About half way through the first sweep, I heard
&gt; my name.
&gt;
&gt; Very exciting and somewhat startling at the same time. Hopefully I
&gt; can get time to do an actual session tonight. I understand it can
&gt; take some time for the box to get &quot;imprinted&quot; as Bruce says.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you Steve for finding this hack and thanks to the others here
&gt; for your endless help to everyone on the board.
