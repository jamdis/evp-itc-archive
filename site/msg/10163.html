ce & NEone else I may have offended





Bruce,
And anyone else who I may h=
ave offended with my email in response to Juli's.
 
When I said that about =
dishonest people, I wasn't talking about you......Juli mentioned some guy w=
ho posted bogus pictures and how she would be leery listening to any of his=
 recordings(and I agree, I would be leery too).   
Quote from Juli down bel=
ow:
 
"However, there are those who I do question, such as the post of Mr.R=
oundtrees photo's (posted the previous day) and given the manufacturing of =
those so called ghost photo's I would serious NEVER take any audio he produ=
ced as creditable. 
This is the point I was trying to make."
 
(That's what=
 I was responding to in regards to dishonest people and frauds). 
 
I'm sor=
ry if it came across differently to you, that wasn't my intention....If edi=
ting(cutting out junk) makes you a "fraud" then I guess I am a fraud too cu=
z I've been cutting junk(static) out of all my clips too!!  But if you read=
 my email it also kinda directs that towards people who cut and paste answe=
rs from different parts of the session, to make it match the question they =
asked.....editing stuff to make it sound good, like ya just had a 5 min con=
vo, or to get the perfect answer to a question you asked.(when I say "you" =
Im not talking aboutYOU Bruce)
 
"it never occurred to me to edit my stuff =
to make it sound good nor did it occur to me that others on here would eith=
er....but ur right there are people out there who are dishonest and would d=
o that without blinkin an eye"
 
I do agree to the skeptics and debunkers b=
e damned!  And ur right, we don't have to prove anything to them...only rea=
l way for them to believe is to be sitting right next to us.  
 
I would, h=
owever, like to be taken seriously(not saying that people don't take you or=
 anyone else seriously)...but since I'm a newbie at this....I feel like i d=
o have to prove myself.....I just don't want people thinking I'm one of tho=
se dishonest types that are out there in the WORLD(not here in the forums) =
so I'm gonna try to remember not to edit my sessions but Im sure I'll forge=
t. (I do save my raw files too incase anyone questions my clips.)...the spi=
rits usually answer any questions almost right away, within 10 to 20 second=
s normally.  I just figured I'd cut out the garbage(static in between) in o=
rder to make smaller files and save space. (Cuz someone said we had to star=
t posting mp3's and making our files smaller...think Misty said that) 
 
Li=
ke I said it never crossed my mind to pull of some trickery like moving ans=
wers around to make it fit to my questions(and I know you would NEVER do th=
at either...heck I didn't even have a single thought about anyone on the tw=
o forums doing such a thing...it never crossed my mind that people doing th=
e box research would be dishonest like that until Juli posted that part abo=
ut the guy with the bogus photos)...but there are all kinds of dishonest pe=
ople in this world(NOT YOU BRUCE!!!) and I'm sure they would do just that w=
ithout batting an eyelash.(Maybe I just like to see the innocense in everyo=
ne til they screw it up)
 
Oh and I had no idea Juli had sent out a 2nd ema=
iling excluding you and Steve...never got that email...probably made its wa=
y into my bulk folder like some do.
 
I'm thinkin maybe you misread what I =
wrote...when you put part of my email into bold and underline you left out =
a part:
"...it never occurred to me to edit my stuff to make it sound good =
nor did it occur to me that others on here would either....but ur right the=
re are people out there who are dishonest and would do that without blinkin=
 an eye."
 (meaning it never crossed my mind that anyone on these forums wo=
uld ever be dishonest like that and I still believe the people posting are =
honest and will stick by that..the only thing that would make me change my =
mind on that is IF someone got busted)
 
Anyways wanted to clear that up wi=
th you...I wasn't directing my email towards you or anyone else on the foru=
ms and I wasn't calling anyone on here a fraud...cuz that would be like the=
 pot calling the kettle black then (I edited my files by cutting out junk i=
n between too!) and I'm sorry if you felt it came off that way...I didn't m=
ean for it to...sometimes I have a bit of a hard time trying to express mys=
elf via email...if we was talkin in real life, face to face that would be a=
 whole `nother ball of wax.
