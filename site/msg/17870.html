Ok, these are about a fella calling himself "Ike" and  to get into the 
light, they had to put him in "community shackles" he says, he  is "grateful."  
From what I understand he at least came out of the lower  plains, and in the 
light, she is probably at least in the light now, but retains  some type of 
shackles  probably to keep him out of trouble.  Earlier,  I was getting him 
asking for prayer, sf
