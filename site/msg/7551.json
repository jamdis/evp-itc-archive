With that being said, I ask if this\ntechnology you all talk about on this group would help me speak with\nthose presences I feel with me? I do not claim a label such as medium,\npsychic or any other title as I think labels are limiting. I am just\nsensitive.\nIt is a sense that has run in my family for generations and somewhere\nalong the line we started calling it radar.\nI have had experienced a situation with a very close friend that a\nshadow literally popped in on us at the exact time her father passed\naway. She was unable to see it and I was. It literally scared the @#$\nout of me. I have been trying to figure out why he came to us and why\nI was the only one to see this. I was hoping this technology would\nhelp me understand the presences that come to me. I have no intentions\nof using this for monetary gain or for other people, I just want to\nunderstand the presences that come to me. Seems the older I get the\nmore prevalent they are.\nLet me know your thoughts.\nMichelle"}
