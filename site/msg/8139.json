Seven represents the enlightened person, full special \norientation, awareness of \nmanifestation. Seven represents perfect groupings, fullness of \nplanetary and angelic \norders. Seven symbolizes perfection of order, energies and spiritual \nprincipals. Seven \nrepresents eternal life and the perfection of a complete cycle. It \nsymbolizes a fresh start \nafter a cycle has been completed and positive regeneration. Seven is \nthe fullness of \nspace and time and the fullness of the universe in motions. Through \nits hidden \nproperties, the number seven maintained all things in being, mundane \nand spiritual, and \nbestowed life. Seven is the number of crowning achievement.\n\nA modern interpretation of the number seven affirms that you are on \nthe right spiritual \npath and that what you are working on creating is very close to \ncoming into being.\n\n__________________________\n\n\n\n\nThis seems to make the most sense to me so far about the #7 some of \nus have been getting.\n\n-Steve H."}
