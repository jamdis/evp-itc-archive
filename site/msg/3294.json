I wonder if a lot of this comes down to some sort of clairaudient ability developing in experimenters.  I mean, the voices are definitely there, but depending on your level of clairaudience (inborn or developing with experimentation) you hear the voices more clearly?  \n  Thanks for your insight.\n\nMisty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n            Ursula\n   \n  For me there is no translating.
