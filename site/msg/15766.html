I second what Misty says, its a great point. believe me=A0Frank is a nice g=
uy he didnt mean any offence, so lets carry on with research and put a pin =
in this silly argument

to be honest I would take what you said to Frank as=
 pretty negative, in his defence he just reacted because he cares about his=
 work, he didnt mean offence...believe me I have been in a similiar situati=
on and then realised, actually I took it the wrong way..heat of the moment,=
 emails can be miscontrued.

its a new day guys and gals lets move on! peri=
od! :-)

=A0 
I am getting pretty=
 tired of a few whos sole purpose in this group is to provoke Frank and oth=
er members into negativity. If it continues you and your fake nicknames wil=
l be removed. Your attempts to promote your "other group" will be viewed as=
 spam and deleted as such. They may go unnoticed by the group but they dont=
 go unnoticed by me. Funny how its always just that one person/group that y=
ou promote while every post you make is not about your research or anyone e=
lses but rather a play on words meant to provoke someone. You should run a =
quick background check on your friend the owner of that "other group" you m=
ay find you know less than you thought you did. You know who you are. And s=
o do I.

As for Frank, he knows I dont always agree with what he says. He k=
nows I definitely dont agree with the namecalling or public venting. Having=
 said that. Frank is the founder of this group. As such he will ALWAYS have=
 a voice here. Those who dont like that or dont agree are free to move on.

If you are here to learn about EVP-ITC, Frank's Box, or share your researc=
h, by all means do so. If you are here for another purpose then dont be sur=
prised when you go to sign in and find you are no longer a member here.
