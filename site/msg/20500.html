<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Question:

I don&#x27;t hear most of the files you post, but you hear them so clearly.  The only way to validate what you hear is true, would be to follow up with something that you got that actually happened.

Have you ever heard a message that came true that nobody else heard, basically validating your experience?

&gt; not going to say anymore, ( I know,  what a relief ! right?), we all know in 
&gt; our hearts how we feel about  things.  I keep getting these kind of 
&gt; messages, and so feel compelled to  let everyone know.  I was also told those that
