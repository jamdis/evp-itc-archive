I got a voice that sounded like Raudive\nsaying copper. I have used plastic and wood. Different materials seem to\nallow different levels, but it&#39;s hard to tell for sure who/what is talking.\n\n Folding the tube seems to make it act like a larger tube. With just a long\nstraight tube the sound tends to be tinny. I made a chamber 12 inches square\nand 4 feet long from MDF board lined with aluminum foil years ago, the\nvoices were almost demonic sounding, so I took it apart.\n\n The only difference with the hacked radio is the sweep. With the hack radio\nthe sweep steps so the radio is tuned in 10khz increments. With the box it&#39;s\na continuous sweep, linear uses a triangle wave.\n\n F-S\n\nOn Fri, Aug 20, 2010 at 4:01 PM, Luis &lt;luispucp098@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok Frank , thanks for your answer , but , what material you recommend for\n&gt; the best results? , what is the diferent whith the long of tubes in results\n&gt; ? and could you say a hacked radio produce the iddentical results like a box\n&gt; built ?

The effect is like a mechanical sound filter. The\n&gt; larger\n&gt; &gt; the siaze the lower tyhe effected frequencies. I use tubing so it can be\n&gt; &gt; made smaller to fit inside a cabinet. I don&#39;t even measure anything when\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; make an echo chamber, it&#39;s just made to fit whatever cabinet I&#39;m using.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The boxes work without the chamber, but the chamber seems to add\n&gt; something,\n&gt; &gt; maybe a space where the sound can be more easily manipulated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; F-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Aug 20, 2010 at 1:40 PM, Luis &lt;luispucp098@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I need to know about the echo chamber ... dimensions, materials ,\n&gt; anyone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knows it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nAluminum seems o wo k he bes .
