It&#39; not like I&#39;m the big expert or something. I \nthink everyone needs a varity of methods to use, cuz it seems like \neverything has it&#39;s time when it works, and nothing else does. I use other \nstuff as the whim hits, but it might be kinda intuition. I want to play with \nthe manual radio method, but I go downstairs, and there sits the \nboard....waiting, so I start playing with that, next thing I know it&#39;s \nmidnight!\nThe only requirement is a radio with a tuning knob, preferabley non-digital. \nYou want a radio that doesn&#39;t kill the audio between stations as you tune \nacross the band. I was &quot;playinig&quot; just a bit, and it does seem to work \nbetter with smooth, constant motion while tuning, maybe taking only a few \nseconds to cover the whole band. I was using the &quot;shower&quot; radio in the \nbathroom. I&#39;m gonna have to do some experimenting, maybe I don&#39;t need the \nrandom voltage, maybe just a slow traingle wave would do, so the tuning \nvoltage slowly goes up, then slowly down. That would be a piece of cake! No \nfinicky noise transisitor would be big plus. I already modified the latest \nboard to take an external VT signal (V-oltage-T-uning), that&#39;s just adding a \nconnector, with a blocking diode to isolate the external voltage from the on \nboard VT amp.\n\n\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWatch free concerts with Pink, Rod Stewart, Oasis and more.
