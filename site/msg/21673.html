<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey, I was noticing that one-word-at-a-time thing the other day. I think
you&#x27;re right. Some of them are way better at this than others. It very
well could be that the blabbery ones are the lower spirits (or what I
think of as the less enlightened ones). The lower ones tend to be
deceitful, too, and more malicious, kind of like they&#x27;re bitter. I just
ignore them, mostly, but sometimes if they get to mouthy, I just turn it
off.  If the more enlightened ones have to work around the others, maybe
that just forces them to make their messages more clear.

&gt; Thanks, but I just think Spirit are getting better with talking to us
then
&gt; it use to be when we first started this, now I can even just talk with
one
&gt; of  them, and they will skip through others with one word at a time
over the
&gt; others  talking, which is really cool!  The ones in the lower plains
really
&gt; do need  prayer and encouragement from us to keep them moving in that
&gt; &quot;long, line of  regrets&quot; as David calls it.sf

&gt; Those are nice recordings, Snow! I can hear most of them very 
clearly.
&gt;
&gt; Nice work!

&gt; &gt; Well, I have some info from the peanut  gallery, most is high
pitched
&gt; so
&gt; &gt; many of you guys won&#x27;t understand  it, signing type angel files, I
&gt; didn&#x27;t want
&gt; &gt; to believe how a mother  could kill her own child, but it seems she
&gt; did the
&gt; &gt; deed. Seems from  what the angels say, the grandma and mom Casey got
&gt; into a
&gt; &gt; fight,  Casey was mad so when the parents were gone, she put the
baby
&gt; into
&gt; &gt;  the truck, and closed the lid, she may have been tied so she 
couldn&#x27;t
&gt; get
&gt; &gt; out and or druged. In one of the files, you can hear  Caylee crying
&gt; for her
&gt; &gt; mama, she stills asks for her mother, and the  angels are saying,
that
&gt; &gt; &quot;Christ holds the baby&quot; I have lots of files  now, there are but a
&gt; few. I think
&gt; &gt; the spirit say, her mother will  &quot;get life.&quot; sf
