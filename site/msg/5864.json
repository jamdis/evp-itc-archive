It wasn&#39;t in the final \nstate of weird yet.  Now I&#39;ve updated the pics to reflect what goes \non those prongs.

LOL  \n&gt; \n&gt; Yesterday, I thought of your little Listen Up! audio amplifier with \nthe \n&gt; Y adapter, headphones and the recorder as an EVP recorder set-up \nfor \n&gt; real time audio EVP on investigations.  My plan is to suit-up one \nof my \n&gt; EVP specialists and test in the field within the next couple \nweeks.  \n&gt; Perhaps, they might be able to hear the replies as it is being \n&gt; recorded, so they can then ask questions.  Interestingly enough, I \njust \n&gt; received an EVP over top of my ghost box sweeping audio on Friday.  \n&gt; Weird. However, I did not envision the chamber with &quot;prongs&quot;(?) \nlike \n&gt; you built, though.  \n&gt; \n&gt; LOL  Can&#39;t wait to hear about your results.\n&gt; \n&gt; LC\n&gt; http://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You know me and my weird devices... yes I&#39;ve built another.\n&gt; &gt; This one came to me in a dream last night.  I think it was \nbecause \n&gt; some \n&gt; &gt; of you guys were talking about echo chambers.\n&gt; &gt; Anyway... when I woke up I went looking around the house for \nstuff to \n&gt; &gt; make this thing before I forgot what it looked like in my dream.\n&gt; &gt; I completed it but now I guess I must test it to see if it is \nwhat I \n&gt; &gt; think it is... an EVP Box, maybe???\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Read more and see a few pictures, here: http://www.ufogeek.com/?\np=200\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
