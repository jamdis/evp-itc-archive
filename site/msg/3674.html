To ALL members of this group,
  I agree with Steve. Ive told you all this many times yet some of you like to get caught up in the heat of the moment.
   
  It is very disturbing to watch you all try to win this war of words. There is no winner just a bunch of losers. And while you are busy losing theres no GOOD research being performed by YOU.
   
  How much research did YOU do today? How much time did you spend firing off replies to attempt to respond to someone you dont even know about something that doesnt even involve YOU? How much time did you spend replying to join in the arguments you feel do involve YOU?
   
  The point being, this is a research group for ITC not a boxing room and definitely your own personal battlegrounds. Take that elsewhere. Healthy discussion is one thing but I have seen very few people offering that. In fact I know a few of you joined here just to go after someone who ticked you off. Then there are those who just seem to be firing in all directions, taget doesnt matter.
   
  Get a grip people!! Ive seen 4 year olds with more self control. If you arent interested in researching ITC for yourself then what the heck are YOU doing HERE. 
   
  ONCE AGAIN THIS IS AN ITC RESEARCH GROUP!! 
   
  As for the box Frank is and always has been the first/primary tester of any box he has built. 
   
  lol
  Misty
   
  P.S. I think you all are capable of finding better things to do, if not let me know and I will give you a few ideas =)

I think we should all focus at the research at hand and forget what 
everyone else is doing. I personally know Chris and think he's a 
great guy and frank feels the same way most days. This has gotten 
to the point where i can't even do a session anymore because i'm so 
blocked by negative thoughts from this group it's pointless to 
concentrate on the box and get results. Honestly who cares what 
chris does anyway, does it really affect everyone's lives that 
much. I have a job and this is a hobby that i used to really like, 
but now this board has brought me down. It seems all people want to 
do is make this like a street fight with challenges and negative 
views and for what reason? If anyone is concerned about hearing 
Chris's audio, i have about 2 hours of box sessions from Eastern 
State on my web site for all to listen to. It's 
www.keyportparanormal.com and go to investigation and click on 
eastern state. All the audio is at the bottom of that page and you 
guys can judge for yourself and i heard a lot come out of that box 
that night personally because i repeated a lot of stuff back to 
chris that i heard. Enough already, let's move on to the next great 
thing. That radio shack hack was a great breakthrough here, let's 
just be happy we got that before it was shut down. Now we have 
another avenue to go down, but we can't do it with all these 
negatives out there. Let's move on to new topics and anyone out 
there that bought a Radio Shack box, start sharing your files with 
the group so it's not just us same 5 that post all the time.

-Steve H.
