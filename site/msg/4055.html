<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = Hi Frank &amp; All, I&#x27;ve read that quartz crystals (because they are grown minerals), are good conductors for Spirits, so having some around while recording may be a good idea! Someone told me that they use a glass on it&#x27;s side and put a mic inside for a sea shell effect while recording EVP&#x27;s and that helps to capture more of them (I guess like an echo chamber effect)!!!    =Judy=           --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:

&gt;  Interesting, but there&#x27;s a few misconceptions about my work. I used 
&gt; quartz crytals, not as part of any circuits or for frequency, some of 
&gt; the &quot;contacts&quot; request the crystals, so I place them on, or in sound 
&gt; chamber, it seems to help with some entities, as do magents used in 
&gt; the same way. There&#x27;s no way to conect them to the circuit.
&gt; 
&gt;  I used radio modules from car stereos because they were already 
&gt; designed to be volatage tuned, so I could use the random voltage 
&gt; generator to tune these moudules randomly. Following EVPmaker as an 
&gt; example, I had thought the tuning had to be random, as I thought 
&gt; there was somekind of quantum resonance going on to get the voices. 
&gt; That assumption has proved to be false, a linear scan is far superior 
&gt; to random scan. I don&#x27;t care what the &quot;primary tester&quot; claims, he 
&gt; doesn&#x27;t make the things. I still don&#x27;t know how the voices are made. 
&gt; 
&gt;  We&#x27;ve also found anyone can do the same thing as a box by manually 
&gt; tuning a radio across it&#x27;s band slowly by hand while recording. It&#x27;s 
&gt; easier to have the precess automated, but the manual method is good 
&gt; for quickie messages and guidence when needed. You wouldn&#x27;t want to 
&gt; get hooked on doing sessions to ask about every little thing in your 
&gt; life though. 
&gt; 
&gt;  Personally, I don&#x27;t have all these higher ideals, asperations, or 
&gt; goals as some seem to claim in the paranormal field. I don&#x27;t insist 
&gt; only the higher beings coming through with only the blessing of some 
&gt; deity--I don&#x27;t care what talks. I get some cussing and name calling --
&gt; sometimes, but big deal! It does in fact show it&#x27;s not broadcast 
&gt; fragments. As for portals some claim opened--I don&#x27;t even know what 
&gt; they are talking about, I have never experienced a portal--or 
&gt; anything that might be considered evil--except perhaps some of the 
&gt; living. I can&#x27;t imagine box use being anymore dangerous than watching 
&gt; to much TV, and taking every show as gospel truth. Wonder how many 
&gt; live their lives by what&#x27;s on Friends, or Saturday Night Live!? 90% 
&gt; or more of what I get is just my familar guys, my unseen friends, 
&gt; talking, mostly very non-profound comments. I get some relatives, my 
&gt; son, and dad, maybe an uncle from time to time, I don&#x27;t take it like 
&gt; it&#x27;s all profound and mystical, it&#x27;s just communcations--ya don&#x27;t 
&gt; have to worship it, and you don&#x27;t need some guru to interpret it! I 
&gt; don&#x27;t know how many can hear this stuff rihgt away, it might take 
&gt; practice, since the voices are composites of various voices and music 
&gt; bits mixed with radio noise. 
&gt;  The function of the box is to provide the &quot;raw&quot; audio which &quot;they&quot; 
&gt; use to form a voice. It is not the only way, there are many method 
&gt; that work as well, and at times better. 
&gt; 
&gt;  As far as antenna, I just use a piece of wire and an Rf amplifier, I 
&gt; don&#x27;t care about resonating for each frquency, that would be very 
&gt; cumbersome, and useless. Imagine a car with 10,000 antennas sticking 
&gt; out it! Even on ham radio I have one 100 foot long dipole I use on 
&gt; all hf bands, and talk all over the world on less than 5 watts. Of 
&gt; course I use an antenna tuner to resonate it for the band I&#x27;m on. I 
&gt; also haven&#x27;t been on the air since starting EVP, it eats all my time!
&gt; 
&gt;  It&#x27;s only the audio that I consider important, radio is a convenient 
&gt; source of a mix of speech, music and noise that can be chopped up 
&gt; easily by tuning. There is a program that does this on the computer, 
&gt; called EVPmaker, and my boxes were an analog version of EVPmaker. I 
&gt; am still curious why some spirits seems unable to use the computer 
&gt; method, which lead to my boxes by asking waht else could I use?
