The\n&gt; &quot;very bored&quot; part, at least if I&#39;m hearing it correctly, proceeds as\n&gt; soon and the name &quot;Tim&quot; is ending and is at a lot lower decibel level.\n&gt; Could be one of those things meant for me to hear, as in I was boring\n&gt; them. It&#39;s any body&#39;s guess.\n&gt; \n&gt; I got better reception as I did the session at around 8:45pm. \n&gt; Nighttime seems better for reception around here. \n&gt; \n&gt; Jeremy\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday\n&gt; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jeremy,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hear the &quot; TIM&quot; very clearly but not the &quot; VERY BORED&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tim may be your assigned technition, next session ask for\n&gt; conformation about\n&gt; &gt; a permanant tech and who Tim is.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@: ecuyler@: Tue, 29 Jan 2008 10:20:26\n&gt; +0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now that I&#39;ve listened to it some more, I think I hear more stuff,\n&gt; butI&#39;m not sure what.
