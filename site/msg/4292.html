<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Even I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for kids. Maybe 15 years old or more, 
and only on their volition, that is only if they had an interest. 

 I can&#x27;t work with Mr. Moon, I do not agree with his &quot;theories&quot; about 
the paranormal, or how the box works. I would be willing to discuss 
it, but I&#x27;m not going to be told how it is. I don&#x27;t think there is a 
danger, other than suggestion, which members of this society are 
really good at giving themselves. 

 As far as &quot;testing&quot; all I can ask is ---Why!? This stuff is highly 
subjective, I know what I hear, and I know it works, I know I get 
meanningful messages. Others won&#x27;t hear what I hear --a test is 
meaningless!

 I think we create all this stuff, voices, hauntings--everything.

&gt; A few weeks ago I posted that Rick Moran had written an article
&gt; stating that children and high school students would be part of the
&gt; testing subjects of the mini-box. Later that day the article was
&gt; replaced with a different article about the mini-box. I was told 
that
&gt; I was stating mis truths. I wasn&#x27;t. I finally was able to locate the
&gt; missing article. I&#x27;m providing a link to the entire article along 
with
&gt; the statement regarding our children. If the link somehow becomes
&gt; unavailable, I have done a screen shot and will provide it to 
whoever
&gt; asks.
&gt; Believe me when I say that this isn&#x27;t to cause or stir crap. I was
&gt; basically called a liar and this clears up that misconception. If I 
am
&gt; banned from this group for telling the truth, than so be it. 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;...it was not the question of whether the phenomenon existed to 
begin
&gt; with, but rather what is the phenomenon.  That will require a good
&gt; deal more effort to explore and beginning in January we will be
&gt; undertaking test sessions all over north and east Texas as well as
&gt; other national locations with a wide variety of folks to see what
&gt; happens within the group dynamic.  The testing will include folks 
who
&gt; are both believers and non-believers, skeptics, critics, other
&gt; researchers, children, high school students, college and grad
&gt; students, and senior citizens to name a few categories.&quot;

&gt; Are you willing to &quot;see what happens&quot; with our children?
