Sorry, I can't remember the name of it. It's down there in Zebulon where
H.=
B lives.

I haven't experienc=
ed the EVP/ITC, but many cemeteries have guardians
that 
try to ward you of=
f in various ways. From my experience, if they finally

decide you're not t=
here to do harm they will kind of back off and leave 
you alone.

A simple =
thing like straightening a skewed tombstone or cleaning up a
mess 
will con=
vince them you're not there to harm. Also, tell them that you're

not there=
 to do damage.
