Hey   Great guys.  Nothing like a very informal but informative radio show.  I actually stopped all work, opened a beer, put my feet up and listened for two hours.  Bruce, living over here in Mexico for many years I was able to demonstrate to my wife and kids what the REAL English language is like.  Nothing like the Brooklyn accent again.  Having been brought up on the east coast near Philly, I really enjoyed listening to you guys.  Loved it.  Thanks.  Great information too.  I plan to share it with my web friends.  Ron L

on my Ghost to Ghost PM internet radio show tonight.
Bruce has helped many of us here, and was kind enough to give me 2 
hours of his time. You can hear that show here:
http://www.ghosttoghostpm.com
It will begin playing automatically once you are on the website.

Thanks...
