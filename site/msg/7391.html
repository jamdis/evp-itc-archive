<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was thumbing through Miss Guiley&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Ghosts and 
Spirits,&quot; today, and was happily surprised to see she is aware that 
the Greeks used the word &quot;daimon&quot; in literature (before Christ) - the 
word &quot;daimon&quot; being best defined as &quot;guardian spirits,&quot; and not 
something &quot;evil.&quot;  The word &quot;demon&quot; evolved out of this 
word &quot;daimon,&quot; and was turned into something believed to be evil and 
fearful by religion over the last two thousand years.  Why can&#x27;t this 
truth get out there to the ghost investigating community?  I plan on 
writing about this in depth over the next month...I am so tired of 
seeing supposed &quot;experts&quot; on TV using demons to try and frighten 
people with this religious dogma. 

Thanks Rosemary for having this fact in your book under the 
word &quot;demon&quot; - most people are not aware this truth.  ;)

&gt;  Personally, I don&#x27;t watch that Hollywood stuff. Interesting that 
&gt; they &quot;have to&quot; use the term demon.
&gt; 
&gt;  and No, don&#x27;t ask!

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;     Yes, the old &quot;demon chasing&quot; crap, once again. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I brought the following thought up elsewhere and will bring it up 
&gt; &gt; here for consideration, too. If ghosts are coming through the box 
&gt; &gt; and thus are not in a good state of mind, how come on Paranormal 
&gt; &gt; State CM was willing to believe the message given by the ghost 
via 
&gt; &gt; the box as being truth (The ghost via the box said a &quot;demon&quot; was 
&gt; &gt; holding the ghosts captive there)? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would suggest that perhaps a ghost (assuming we are talking 
about 
&gt; a 
&gt; &gt; disembodied person who remains earthbound) is not in a healthy 
&gt; state 
&gt; &gt; of mind one would consider &quot;stable,&quot; but trapped in emotional 
&gt; trauma 
&gt; &gt; of some sort. Thus, how reliable could the message of a ghost 
then 
&gt; &gt; be? ;)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Don&#x27;t know if anyone caught it, but Frank&#x27;s box was used on last
&gt; &gt; &gt; night&#x27;s episode of Paranormal State on A&amp;E. They were 
&gt; investigating
&gt; &gt; &gt; an old insane asylum, and they had Chris Moon as a guest 
&gt; &gt; investigator
&gt; &gt; &gt; with the box. You can see the promo clip here:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.pennstat eprs.com/ ps_asylum. mov
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Here&#x27;s the site for the show itself:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.aetv. com/paranormal- state/index. jsp
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; For those not familiar, its a half hour show that follows along 
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Penn State Paranormal Research Society&quot; and different cases 
they 
&gt; &gt; take
&gt; &gt; &gt; on. Their niche in the &quot;paranormal reality tv show&quot; market is 
that
&gt; &gt; &gt; the group&#x27;s leader follows a more Christian orientated skew on
&gt; &gt; &gt; happenings. Lots of &quot;demons&quot; (they have Lorraine Warren guest 
all 
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; time), and they usually try to do investigations/ communication 
&gt; only
&gt; &gt; &gt; during what they call &quot;dead time&quot;, 3am-4am, or &quot;the polar 
&gt; opposite 
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3pm - the time Jesus gave is life for all mankind&quot; as they put 
&gt; it. 
&gt; &gt; Oh,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and they have an &quot;occult specialist&quot; on the team that so far 
has 
&gt; &gt; been
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything but.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; On the positive side, they did actually get (and record for 
later
&gt; &gt; &gt; analysis) live communication on the box in response to 
questions 
&gt; &gt; being
&gt; &gt; &gt; asked. And on the analysis and isolation of the recorded parts, 
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; could actually hear what was being said (as opposed to the 
usual 
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Chris acting as a go-between for very distorted sounds like on 
&gt; those
&gt; &gt; &gt; youtube videos). So it was good to see it a)working in 
the &quot;field&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; and b)get some exposure on a tv show.
