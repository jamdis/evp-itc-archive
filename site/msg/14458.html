2 different things happening-that's why. When you get EVP that everyone und=
erstands, it is outward, in the environment. Not a communication through su=
bconscious means.

EVP that people swear they hear, but noone else can make=
 sense, may be a message to them via subconscious means. That isn't to say =
that ALL EVP's like this are true messages, I am sure alot are just matrixi=
ng.

But then that is how the art of scrying starts-matrixing. Like the Ror=
schach tests. The images you matrix with those gives the psychologist an in=
sight into your mind.

By gazing into a dark, reflective surface, you start=
 to see cloudy images. At first, you will just be matrixing faces in the cl=
ouds and not getting much substance. Try it, you will see what I am saying.=
 With practice, you start to see clear, concise images.

I think that is wh=
at happening with audio as well.

We already know for a fact pareidolia can=
 occur in audio as well as visual stimulus.
