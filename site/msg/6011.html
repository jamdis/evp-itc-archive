For those of you who don't know, I had an opportunity to do a box session this weekend in Kentucky.  It was a chance to work with some very serious people in EVP-ITC work.  This allowed us a platform to introduce the boxes to new comers interested and continuing the research in this field.  We assisted 8 new people in hacking the RS 469 in our efforts as well as getting additional exposure with another colleagues to spread the work about what we doing on future radio broadcasts.  
   
  I posted the files in the group for your listening.  I was able to conduct a session with Joe's box and found many differences from the RS.  I had not had a chance to conduct a session with a Franks box since April of last year, therefore to get a custom to the classic transmission (the original sounds and voices conveying) took a few sessions to get my ear in tune.  It was like riding a bike, and I must admit in reviewing my RS 469 & 470 there is quite a bit of difference with the recorded audio. (if you get a chance, listen and compare).
   
  I have discovered that with the RS versions they voices what is being heard in real time are very similar in sound, not radically changing in the pitch.  Where is the Joe's box, the voice fragments are mixed and can be female and male blended together to form the response.
   
  This is amazing and very interesting, but regardless, the real time communication is there, and giving your determination for a good session the other side will come through.

            Juli,
   
  It was awesome this weekend.  Got some great material.  It was great to do  box sessions with you,  especially with the results we got out of it.  It was a pleasure to be working with such professional people.  I am looking forward to doing more sessions with you and Joel, and of course Joe ....:)  Talk to you soon.

          Guys, 
I just posted several files from a joint session this weekend in 
Kentucky. I would appreciate the imput from those who are serious 
about the research here. Many of the serious researchers have spent 
years, and countless hours a day testing these lines of communication. 
I for one refuse to allow the negitive get to me and will continue to 
work either independently or with my fellow colleages who truly respect 
each other and their contributions in this area.

So with that being said, I hope you enjoy the audio clips. 
They are from a Joe's Box session.

In addition, I have introduced several new researchers to the 
RS hacked in hopes that their their future studies will add in our up 
hill climb in pursuing what we started.

Thanks!
Juli
