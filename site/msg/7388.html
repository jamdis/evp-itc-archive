Chrissy:  That's OK! 
   
                 The recorders are your preference as well as the software.  I currently have 3 different recorders, that are digital.  My favorite by far is the olympus digital voice recorder WS-100.  It  just unsnaps and you can up load it right to the computer and into your audio program.  You can choose any recorder, just make sure you can up load it directly with the USB port.  If they do not, then once again you will have to purchase a Patch Cord.
   
                  As far as the software, this too is your preference.  Frank uses EVP Maker, I Adobe Audition, Steve & Jeff, Cool Edit Pro etc.  You need to find out what works best for you.  Maybe some of the others can suggest different programs as well.
   
                   As far as a mixer, I do not use one.  Mike and I believe LC (and maybe Frank R. correct me if I am wrong) use them, but they are not necessary.
   
                   Everything is trial and error, nothing etched in stone.  We all use different method and its all about what you feel comfortable with and what works best for you. 
   
                   You have to remember, we all have different theories, and beliefs, and our comment element here between us all is the desire for 2 way communication.  Therefore, we all are trying something new all the time, and sharing our techniques and experiences.
   
  I wish you luck!

  What type of recorder do I buy that will work with a computer. Also what type of mixer do I need and where do I find the program. Sorry for all the questions.
  Hugs

  Christine,    Welcome aboard!!!  
   
                   I currently do convential recordings with all of my boxes, just by simply seting the recorder next to the speaker when doing a session.  Depending on the recorder, I just download it to the computer via your audio program.  If you don't have a usb cord with your computer, purchase a patch cord from Radio Shack and that should do the trick!  
   
                   Mike and many others here use additional things to enhance the best out of their sessions, such as putting them in boxes, additional white noise, (such as water, ceiling fans ect.).  I suggest to try many different things and find out what suites you best!
   
                     I'm looking forward to your clips!
