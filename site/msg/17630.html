&gt;    Easy to claim one is all modern and sophisticated, that all is known,
&gt; there are no demons, gods,or angels. Easy to forget, modern man doesn&#x27;t know
&gt; squat! All your science, all your universities, all your &quot;logic&quot;--nothing!
&gt; Y&#x27;all don&#x27;t know anythin&#x27;!
&gt;
&gt;  Awhile back I had an experience where I was awakened in the middle of the
&gt; night to what seemed to be some entity crawling up inside my body starting
&gt; at my feet, accompanied by weird visions/hallucinations, unable to move.
&gt; Easy to dismiss as dreams, maybe a bit of undigested beef-to quote scrooge,
&gt; but none of my usual protection stuff worked, till I thought &quot;Jesus!&quot; The
&gt; thing lifted it&#x27;s head and took off. I&#x27;m still not a believer, but I&#x27;m not a
&gt; total rejector either. There has been times when I needed &quot;His&quot; help, and
&gt; was answered, plus, what I guess were angels, in open air &quot;Frank, He heard
&gt; you&quot;. I don&#x27;t believe in the church crap, but God is out there!  Not only
&gt; that, is been &quot;:scientifically&quot; -as close to -proven as possible-- that the
&gt; Shoud of Turin is in fact waht it appears to be--Jesus! Same question, what
&gt; the hell kind of evidence will you find acceptable?
&gt;
&gt;  Some here will still insist all is known, and they are in fact the most
&gt; advanced being the universe has ever seen--they have a great deal to learn!
&gt; I try to tolerate their arrogance, but my patience is gone for that stuff.
&gt; When they get over their name calling, maybe they will be allowed to post.

&gt;&gt;    Snowfire, if i was dead (passed on) and was able to by happenstance
&gt;&gt; come across you and the evp device and you asked me the question, what makes
&gt;&gt; you think I know what I am talking about? Because I would tell you that
&gt;&gt; their is no antichrist, no devil, no anthropomorphic hebrew savage god who
&gt;&gt; commands his people to murder children and women in one town and in the next
&gt;&gt; town kill all but virgin girls (old testament).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would say that there is only consciousness, not confined to any man made
&gt;&gt; religion.

&gt;&gt;  this one is very scary, I have not cleaned it up, I was asking about the
&gt;&gt; antichrist, and if he was released yet, and they are saying, &quot;yes, he has
&gt;&gt; been released, yes, he has, and that Christ is coming.&quot;  Please, don&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; get left here, just believe in what JC did, and don&#x27;t be left behind, &quot;the
&gt;&gt; teleport is going to be instantaneous, &quot; we won&#x27;t feel a thing, one minute
&gt;&gt; you will be sitting at a desk, next minute we will find our self in some
&gt;&gt; grassy field is what I was told.  I have more, I haven&#x27;t cleaned them up
&gt;&gt; yet, but you can see how plain and clear they are from that newer RS that I
&gt;&gt; messed up the other day.  They are saying scary things on it, they said, he
&gt;&gt; is not the devil, that the antichrist is a &quot;spirit energy&quot; &quot;worse then the
&gt;&gt; devil,&quot; and will &quot;infect&quot; posess some person after Obama.
