Just a question I am certain you have covered, but...
Could you tell me what your set up is when you use the MB.  How you
record and what you use.  What is plugged into what and so forth?
Thanks
Rob.

&gt; hey,
&gt; 
&gt; I did a MB session today and asked for Ms. Estep.
&gt; Mike and lisa were kind enough to bring her forward and help with the 
&gt; communication. I believe she is still adjusting to being on the other 
&gt; side and has not fully grasped how to send communication from the other 
&gt; side, with an array of different boxes to work with.
&gt; 
&gt; I asked about the prior message concerning her whistle statement, the 
&gt; answer I recieved was &quot;they whistled often&quot; I&#x27;m assuming she meant her 
&gt; spirit contacts.
&gt; 
&gt; The files are posted in a sub folder marked MB_files in my main folder
&gt; Bruces box files. In the future all sub folders for different box files 
&gt; will be in this sub folder.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks guy&#x27;s
