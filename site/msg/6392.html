&gt; Hi Ann,
&gt;
&gt; Could be &quot;Estep,&quot; rest is not clear to me. Sounds like a male voice,
&gt; maybe someone talking about Sarah?

&gt; &gt; Gimme some opinions on this one, gang. The first part of the clip is
&gt; &gt; the speed it can through at. The repeat is slowed by about 70  
&gt; percent.
&gt; &gt; I hear it as &quot;Estep.&quot; I thought I had heard the word yes, so I ask,
&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes?&quot; Under my voice is the name &quot;Andrew,&quot; then &quot;I&#x27;m Stu.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Perfect.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &quot;No..??...asshole...fucking scared.&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Do you hear this as I do? I&#x27;m postulating right now that because I
&gt; &gt; live immediately across the street from a cemetery, and in a
&gt; &gt; 100-year-old sitting atop a 200+-year-old foundation and cellar,  
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; perhaps local dead folk who haven&#x27;t crossed are popping in during
&gt; &gt; sessions. The voice that said &quot;fucking scared&quot; I swear I heard in
&gt; &gt; another file in my folder saying &quot;scared people.&quot;
