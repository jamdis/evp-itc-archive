<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>How much do you trust your own observations? How certain are you of what you
see and hear and don&#x27;t see and hear? I think it comes down to that.

People with a lot of uncertainty may claim things like &quot;pareidolia&quot; or
whatever, but if you have the certainty and confidence to say you hear this
or that, then you really don&#x27;t care.

No doubt some people DO fall pray to pareidolia (whatever that is) but I&#x27;m
not one of them. I do have to wonder about the people who see &quot;orbs&quot; in
every photo but don&#x27;t know enough about photography to say whether they may
in fact be something uusual or not. I&#x27;m not one of them.

I think it&#x27;s a good idea to put the audio clips up here for others to listen
to. Others may hear something different. That doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re wrong in
your initial interpretation. You&#x27;re free to agree with the other person and
revise what you say you hear. And you&#x27;re free not to.

Does this make sense or do I need more coffee this morning?

&gt; That person is no longer allowed ot contribute! I&#x27;ve had it with these
&gt; nasty negative attacks when we present--at least to us--what seems to be
&gt; evidence, and/or discuss various methods and techniques. These &quot;skeptics&quot;
&gt; accept no evidence and basically call anyone doing this research either
&gt; crazy or liars. They have no place on this group, this group is not about
&gt; gettng accpetable evidence, or the &quot;proof&quot; that will play in some air head
&gt; university, it&#x27;s about exploring something that is real and demonstratable.
&gt; I do think for myself and I don&#x27;t need some duffus to tell me what is
&gt; acceptable to think about.

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It seems to me that simply being on this list and taking these
&gt; discoveries seriously, we already ARE thinking for ourselves.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Seriously, why would anyone use/waste time on this subject (and this
&gt; list) if he or she wanted the safety of accepted, mainstream, dogmatic
&gt; thinking? (Rhetorical question.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I understand that some people feel obliged to play &quot;Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot;
&gt; with new and extraordinary theories and R&amp;D, but it seems to me that the
&gt; Devil has enough advocates, thank you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Healthy skepticism is one thing. All I&#x27;m seeing here is compelling
&gt; evidence supporting EVP/ITC, followed by attempts to shout down the
&gt; concepts.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It looks like you&#x27;re attacking the messenger. I don&#x27;t think this is the
&gt; right forum for that... if any is.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; However, since I&#x27;m new to this Yahoo Group, maybe I misunderstood what
&gt; this group is about.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bemused,
