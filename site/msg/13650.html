My thing is I am in it for my self only. I care not what other people think=
 about me or my methods. I stay out of all the back stabbing gossip and do =
my thing. I don't trash talk other teams, and I don't listen to them trash =
talk anyone else.

Frank should just do his thing and ignore the bull. He s=
houldn't let it bother him so much. In this field, nothing has been proven,=
 so therefore there is no right or wrong. He should do it to please himself=
 only.

        It sounds like a tricky situation, =
and I'm not sure what to suggest. I suppose one route is to, as you suggest=

e and decide if it's worth the frustration, the stress, and the angst, espe=
cially what it does to your health.  Nothing is worth throwing your health =
away over.  

        Even dropping all this, just for a while, might also =
tell you if any health problems you are experiencing might be being aggrava=
ted by all the drama.  And it might have the side effect of letting all the=
 negativity and egos out there burn themselves out, so if you do look back =
into things a while down the road, it could be a prettier picture then.

  =
      Other than a full retreat, I don't think anything else would make a d=
ifference other than a full attack: creating, for  instance, good objective=
 standards for evaluation and test of the technology and results, which the=
 shows and 'experts' seem to find anathema.  Then, if their claims were to =
be confronted by such standards, they'd find themselves unable to stand up =

                    Thanks Rick! You seem to have pu=
t alot of thought and time into that. 

                     What really bo=

         =
            I don't do ghost hunts or invesitgations, but the hauntings I'v=
e heard of seem to be nothing more than something trying to get someone's a=
ttention. It's these experts that turn it into something that must be negat=
ive.  There's Hollywood, such as the "Haunting In CT", these same experts w=
ill proclaim is based on fact, when the facts are probably nothing more tha=
n your creaking floors, just to make the whole paranoramal field dark and d=
emon filled. In my case, fear does not sell, I won' watch those movies.

                    I think there is good EVP evidence, and I've heard many=

That is an interesting observation. I think the core of the issue is that t=
here seems to be a `sweet spot' in paranormal beliefs where there is just e=
nough science, just enough technical backing, just enough paranormal claims=
, and just enough indefinite evidence that keeps people interested in the g=
host hunting mentality

                      Evidence which becomes too in=
definite turns off most people. As they become more aware of sensitives who=
 simply make claims ("I feel there is a GHOST here!"), but provide no evide=
nce other than statements, people eventually get bored. Similarly, people e=
ventually grow tired of the anthropomorphism of every little occurrence in =
a house: a creak implies a footstep, which implies a person, which, if not =
seen, implies a ghost. But a creak does not equal a footstep.

            =
          And while this kind of indefinite evidence can lose an audience, =
so can evidence that is claimed to be "obviously" evident by technology. He=
re, the investigator is no longer making vague claims, but waving science a=
round, like FLIR cameras, or EMF meters, and then making proclamations of t=
he results. But again, people eventually see these are just lights and soun=
ds from electronics, and investigators making more claims. It's like the ps=
ychics again, but with visual aids.

                      I think the reas=
on EVP studies are not securing more interest, as you noted, are a little o=
f both effects. First is the anthropomorphism problem: I notice many EVP ex=
perimenters proclaim what their results sound like, or name the sound file =
by what they've heard. But like the creaks, "sounds like" does not equal "i=
s". This is then compounded by the technology backing: regardless of how va=
lid the EVP researcher's results are, the technology can seem intimidating,=
 but the researchers often proclaim the obviousness of their results. Peopl=
e again become turned off by it because it is not obvious to them, and in t=
he end it is just another piece of technology presenting sounds, with no ob=
vious connection to the paranormal, except by the claims and interpretation=
s of the presenters.

                      I believe, taking these issues =
into account, there is a way for EVP studies to garner more interest. For n=
ow, the analysis coming from the researchers usually seems like a claim, an=
d it is these claims, imho, that is being classified by the public with the=
 rest of the paranormal claims, and so, it also becomes less of an interest=
. A new approach could be one without the claims and interpretations of the=
 investigators, one where the sounds are simply played and not labeled. The=
 interpretation of the data could be left to the listeners. Web sites which=
 present EVPs could be developed where people could not see others interpre=
tations until they entered their own. I think this would be such a novel ap=
proach, that it would give the public a better feeling of true involvement =
in the research, and feel less like they are simply being exposed to the cl=
aims of others. And I think that feeling of involvement is what is needed t=
o reignited the public interest here.

    =
                  which implies a person, which, if not seen, implies a

m: I notice many EVP experimenters proclaim what

         equal "is". This is then compounded by the technology

           backing: regardless of how valid the EVP researcher's

             results are, the technology can seem intimidating, but the 
  =
                    researchers often proclaim the obviousness of their

                    results. People again become turned off by it because i=

<BR>I believe,

 For now, the analysis

sually seems like a claim, 
                      and it is these claims, i=
mho, that is being classified by 
                      the public with the=
 rest of the paranormal claims, and so, 
                      it also beco=
mes less of an interest. A new approach could 
                      be one=
 without the claims and interpretations of the 
                      inves=
tigators, one where the sounds are simply played and 
                     =
 not labeled. The interpretation of the data could be left

           developed where people could not see others

   interpretations until they entered their own. I think this

          would be such a novel approach, that it would give the 
         =
             public a better feeling of true involvement in the

            research, and feel less like they are simply being exposed 
   =
                   to the claims of others. And I think that feeling of

                    involvement is what is needed to reignited the public
