When you email a file, if it is =\r\nnot saved as a compressed format, the email filtering process will actually=\r\n compress the file automatically.\n\nSo even if you have attached a wav. file=\r\n, it will loose resolution over the email process. It will not sound exactl=\r\ny the same as the original wav. file. How much it differs depends on the si=\r\nze of the file you are attaching. If it is a very large file, it will sound=\r\n much different.\n\nThe only exception to this is if the wav. file is small e=\r\nnough that the filtering process will ignore it. It has to be pretty small =\r\nthough, like under 1 MB (I am not exactly sure of the threshold).\n\nThe best=\r\n way to share files over the internet if you want them as close to the orig=\r\ninal as possible is to upload them directly to a website.\n\n  ----- Original=\r\n Message ----- \n  From: Rj \n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, =\r\nMay 10, 2009 10:54 AM\n  Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n =\r\n       Pixelization doesn&#39;t clean-up the data: it replaces it.  Imagine tak=\r\ning a picture of a field of flowers, and beginning to add levels or pixeliz=\r\nation to the picture.  Soon, you would not be able to tell there were flowe=\r\nrs there at all.  You would see a lot of colored blocks.\n\n        Or in the=\r\n other direction, imagine you are looking at a competely randomize bunch of=\r\n pixes on your screen: a complete screen of truely random static snow.  Pix=\r\nelizing this, after a while, you would again start to see colored blocks.\n\n=\r\n        What&#39;s happening is that it is processing an area of the image, tak=\r\ning (for instance) the average value of that entire area, and replacing all=\r\n the blocks in that area with the average.  In video processing, this would=\r\n result in a field of multi-colored flowers being replaced by, for instance=\r\n, a big greyish-bluish block, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the noise=\r\n example, it maybe replace all the random pixels with another big greyish-b=\r\nluish block.  If you did not know beforehand what the original picture was,=\r\n you couldn&#39;t tell whether your pixelized image was really a field of flowe=\r\nrs, a chevy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.\n\n        It =\r\nworks the same with the sound files.  Taking something as complex as speech=\r\n, and replacing frequencies with their averages, loses the speech the farth=\r\ner you go, until you head strange fluctuating square waves.  Doing the same=\r\n to random static will eventually produce the same thing.  And random fluct=\r\nuating square waves can sound a bit like speech - or at least, you could ha=\r\nve fun sharing with each other what you thing they &#39;sound like&#39;.\n\n\n\n\n\n     =\r\n   --- On Sun, 5/10/09, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n       =\r\n   From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt;\n          Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC=\r\n] File uploading rules\n          To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n          Date=\r\n: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 9:29 AM\n\n\n                I always save the whole f=\r\nile in wav format then do my clips as mp3.

While some formats (like wav)=\r\n can store the audio very close to the way it was recorded, formats like mp=\r\n3 compress the file, and in so doing lose some of the sonic details.  This =\r\nmay not be a big deal in music, where the audio is fairly clear to begin wi=\r\nth.  But with sound sources with a lot of noise (like evps), this can not o=\r\nnly obscure any real sounds, but pixelize non-sounds (like white noise) and=\r\n make them start to sound like speech.\n\n                        So mp3 migh=\r\nt be good for sharing the data, once you&#39;ve already formed an opinion based=\r\n on an analysis of the wav file.
