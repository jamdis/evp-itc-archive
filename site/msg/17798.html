<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Not in a cabinet yet, but all assembled. In the videos I was trying to hold
the cell phone close to the speaker since I had tthe volume down cuz of feed
back. The digital scope really interferes with AM. Digital===crap!!

 The MP3 starts out &quot; I&#x27;ve got your money!....&quot; and at 6.7 seconds &quot;Just
love those boobs&quot;, and that seems to repeat at 26.69 sconds, followed by
&quot;Frank saw me&quot;. At 35 seconds &quot;we--We talk--that brings comfort&quot;. This echo
chamber is 4 1/2 inches long, 1 inch PVC conduit, but only two channels. The
speaker is from a an old modem, and the mic from a dead tape deck. This
first segment was FM.
