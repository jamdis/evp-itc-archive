After learning more, I decided to pursue my interest with the help of EVP Maker software rather than a hacked radio. Today I picked up an EVP on my first attempt. I&#39;ve uploaded it to the new &quot;Al&#39;s Files&quot; folder. \n\nThe significance: My full first name is Alger, but I go by &quot;Al&quot; because most people mispronounce Alger. It appears that the spirit entity knows my full first name. Do you guys understand the sentence the way that I am hearing it: &quot;Alger help me&quot;  ? Most people incorrectly pronounce Alger with a &quot;grrr&quot; growling sound rather than the softer &quot;jer.&quot; The evp seems to have gotten the pronunciation right, though it is difficult to make out distinctly in the robotic voice.\n\nAnother question: I get a lot of &quot;Help me&quot; statements. What is that all about? Any theories? From what do they need help? Anyone else get a lot of calls for  &quot;help&quot; ?\n\nThanks,\nAl"}
