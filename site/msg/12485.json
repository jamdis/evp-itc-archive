I asked him if he carries all of\nthat...how does he have the hand movement to carry a digital camera,\nParanormal Puck, temperature detector, EVP recorder? He has yet to\nanswer...LOL. ..\n&gt; Another guy who is a local investigator once posted that he carries\na GUN with him when he goes out on investigation! ! THIS guy scares me\nway more than the relic toting, holy water thrower...\n&gt; Al\n&gt;"}
