Frank, I really don't understand what you are saying here, what do you mean 
 by: " "Not only that, you are not this body, you are not this ego, you are 
 not this personality-"Not only that, you are not this body, you are not 
this ego, you are  not this personality-<WBR>-in reality. Everyone of is 
someone/somethi  ???
 
And I don't know anything about any cd's, as for old Mr Horns, if people  
stopped giving him recognition, he would probably get bored and leave them  
alone, also, that is the reason to say the psalms to protect yourself, and 
that  is why to "test the spirit's to see if they be of God."  Guess, I 
thought  you were someone else, I only stumbled into these groups, out of 
interest, I  knew they were doing the evp's but, i had no idea you all were doing 
Real time  evp's.  Their are many ways you can test the people you get, if you 
say the  Lord's Prayer anything not of God would leave, say the Psalms; 91. 
27. 23 and 8  and you never have to worry, they make you a spiritual 
shield.   As  for what you said about "victory for......" well, if we keep God 
first nothing  else matters.

"Not only that, you are not this body, you are not this ego, you are not  
this personality-"Not only that, you are not this body, you are not this ego, 
you are not  this personality-<WBR>-in reality. Everyone of is 
someone/somet 

I already had someone send me a bunch of CDs claiming all this was  
predicted years ago. I sent the stuff back. I don't care what was  predicted, cuz 
most of that stuff comes from someplace that usually doesn't  have your best 
interests in mind. What a victory for Satan if he can  trick many into 
abandoning their life's path/lesson in favor of listening to the  dearly 
departed! I'm not religous, but there is that level out there.  "
