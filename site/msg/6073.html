adios but no idea what to do with them.

  Car=
ol B.,
   
  I'm sure you will associate me with the hoopla that took place=
 yesterday.
  I must apologise for my conduct. Please understand this is no=
t a typical thing here
  it is a rare occasion.
   
  To answer your questi=
on, I have been a long time researcher and do research daily with every box=
 that is available today
  including a Frank's box.
   
  If you already ha=
ve your RS box and it is modified, you are 75% of the way there. 
  I will =
explain in detail how to do a successful session.
  Let your spirit friends=
 know you are about to turn the box on and ask if they would please join yo=
u in a communication session.
  Turn on your recording device(whichever you=
 choose to record the session) state the date and time and number the sessi=
on so you have a referral at a later date.
  Turn your RS box on and start =
the scan. I prefer and always use the AM band to do a session, it is less c=
luttered than FM and I find it easier to hear real time messages and answer=
s.
  At first you can ask simple questions that will require short answers =
such as " are there any spirits listening that wish to communicate with me"=
 
  "can you say my name", " can you tell me your name" questions along tho=
se line will glean short understandable answers and messages. Not only for =
hearing in real time but also later when reviewing the recording.
   
  It =
will take time for you to develop what we call an ear for hearing the commu=
nication, that just means your listening skills during a session will becom=
e more honed and acute to the messages and answers being sent. Do not get d=
iscouraged if you do not hear any responses the first couple of sessions. O=
ur friends need time to adjust to a new researcher and assign you a technic=
ian.
  But you can rest assured the communication will come.
   
  Keep the=
 sessions to a limit of 10 to 15 minutes as to not overwhelm yourself when =
you need to listen back carefully to the recording or stress the energy sup=
ply of your spirit contacts.
   
  When you are done with your session let =
your spirit friends know you are about to end the session and turn the box =
off and give them about ten seconds before you do turn the box off.
   
  e=
xtend the same courtesy as you would speaking to someone on the phone, say =
goodbye and thank you and you will almost always get a cordial response.
  =
 
  shut your box and again thank them for their efforts. you have now done=
 a rudimentary box session. load it onto the computer and review it for mes=
sages and answers to your question that you missed during the live session.=
 when you have done this post a message to the board and I will explain how=
 to do a basic edit of the recording to better understand the responses tha=
t are less clear.
   
  good luck Carol and I am looking forward to researc=
hing with you.
   
  Bruce
