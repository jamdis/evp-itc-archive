On the lazer I used the lazer (I know it is spelled laser but i like to use=
 the 'z') as a transmitter. The beam itself is the carrier! As for the spir=
icom type device I used a couple cheap (29.99) multichannel walkie talkies =
that you can get at walmart or RS. I modified the transmitter side to key t=
he transmitter via computer (evpmaker) and added a 9mm jack as an input. I =
also modified the receiver by adding a 9mm audio jack so I could record wit=
h or without ambient noise.

I don't know if it makes a difference since=
 they seem to know what I'm doing with me telling them but I told them what=
 frequencies I would transmit at just in case.
