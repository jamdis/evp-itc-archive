I organized=\r\n this group in 1998, and have been in\nthe research of Ghost and Paranormal =\r\nhappenings ever since. I&#39;m the\nofficial paranormal researcher for the Stran=\r\nahan House which is Fort\nLauderdale&#39;s oldest and most haunted historical la=\r\nndmark. We have gotten\nmany EVP&#39;s by use of digital recorder. There are 5 i=\r\nntelligent haunts\nthat are in the house and one residual haunt outside of t=\r\nhe house. Most\nof the evp work has been handled by me, but I have been teac=\r\nhing some of\nmy member to work their own recordings.\n \nI am totally fascina=\r\nted by your use of the &quot;Frank&#39;s Box&quot;. My\ncongradulations to your success, F=\r\nrank and those who use the box on the\nresearch that you&#39;ve accomplished. In=\r\n this, I&#39;m also dissappointed by\nthose who have used your box to make money=\r\n or notority to gain fame by\nit. I won&#39;t mention names, to mention them wil=\r\nl only give them more\nstrength. \n \nWe are currently trying to do the Radio =\r\nShack hack of the 12-469 and\nhope to be successful in this trial by error. =\r\nHoping that our work will\nproduce something that we&#39;ve been trying to accom=\r\nplish like you all\nhave, two way communication with astral beings. It&#39;s fus=\r\ntrating to do\ndigital recordings and having to wait and sift through the re=\r\ncordings to\nget information. We hope to elliminate that with the hack.\n \nAr=\r\ne Frank&#39;s boxes available for retail? I&#39;ve heard of the Mini Box that\nis co=\r\nming out soon and they are taking pre-orders for this product. Our\ngroup is=\r\n small and we don&#39;t charge for our research at the historical\nlandmarks tha=\r\nt we do here in Fort Lauderdale, so we are looking for the\nbest at the lowe=\r\nst route approach.\n \nOur next project is a Historical Firehouse that is hau=\r\nnted by the ghost\nof Robert Leland Knight. There is a mystery on how he die=\r\nd, but legend\ngoes that he fallen in a water puddle that was electricfied b=\r\ny a downed\nwire. He was a large man and a Golden Glove champ of Florida. It=\r\n was his\nsecond week of working at the firestation and he didn&#39;t have his g=\r\near\nbecause it had to be ordered. There is some who think (psychics) that h=\r\ne\nmight have been pushed out of the firetruck as a prank that went wrong.\n =\r\n\nThis firehouse has had media play with the Sci-fi channel in a show\ncalled=\r\n &quot;Proof Positive&quot;. The firestation is becoming a museum, and is\nallowing us=\r\n to spend the night in doing an investigation about Robert.\nThere are some =\r\nwho believe that some of the haunt has to do with a\nhanging tree that was a=\r\nt the opposite corner of the Firestation. We are\nexcited about doing an inv=\r\nestigation of this Historical Landmark, but\nare cautious of the fact that t=\r\nhere will be low level spirits/astral\nbeings that might be present.\n \nFrank=\r\n, If you have the time to answer me, that will be great. Those who\nhave the=\r\n &quot;Frank&#39;s box&quot;, if you can tell me how you obtained yours, that\nwill be hel=\r\npful also. I would be greatful for any help at this point.\n \nThanks for let=\r\nting me listen in on all of your discoveries and\nsuccesses.\n \nBest Regards,=\r\n\nJohn Marc Carr\nwww.sefgr.com\n \n\n \n\r\n------_=_NextPart_001_01C87A40.73EC2F14\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.=\r\nw3c.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-eq=\r\nuiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Dus-ascii&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=\r\n=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3268&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY style=3D&quot;BACKGROU=\r\nND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D323052619-280=\r\n22008&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;John,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D323052619-28022008&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;Frank does not make any boxes to sell.
