Got one evp...man said &quot;were dead&quot;, I also went over to the Jewish Burial Site. I asked to have an Elder or someone with an accent to speak so I could have some proof. I get this EVP. It says &quot;Jim &gt;Salonika &lt; Hanukka&quot; Now I&#39;m NOT positive it says &quot;Solonika&quot; but I tried to use &quot;savonika&quot; (spelled it something like that) and Google gave the Salonika suggestion. But I do know it says &quot;JIM.........HANUKKAH&quot;. \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Jim%27s%20RR-DR60%20EVP%27s/Jim_Salonika_Hanukkah-2-evp.mp3 \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles\n\nRegards,\n\nclockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt;"}
