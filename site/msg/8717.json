I have many good examples but no \norganization (other than keeping the clips from a session, or a day, grouped together in \nthe same folder).  It&#39;s hard for me to keep track of everything.  Eons ago, I used to create \nsimple databases with Filemaker Pro.  I&#39;ve been thinking lately, I need to come up with \nsomething to use as references for the details for various clips.  I&#39;d be interested in \nknowing what, if anything, others are using.  \n\nMargaret \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yeah, i only post the files if they have a certain meaning or are \n&gt; really clear for others to listen.  I probably average about 15 files \n&gt; in a 5 minute session, but will only post maybe 3 or 4.  If you do \n&gt; enough sessions, the good files with start to add up.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Steve.
