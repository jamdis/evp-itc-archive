Marked me as spam... bastards! lol I just cleaned house myself of some trou=
blemakers that worked their way into my spirit group. Seems to have worked,=
 for now. Could it be in any way a technical fluke that you are not getting=
 responses or are these email addresses that worked until recently.

If you=
 are being ignored, oh well you can't control the responses of the ignorant=
. With such a petty attitude they are not cut out for this type of "bigger =
than myself" research. I have had people comment on the "spirits" language =
in my recordings. Saying its negative and unnecassary! Some of my spirit fr=
iends may use bad language and speak in slang to make a point or just carry=
 on a conversation but that is because I encourage the free flowing of info=
rmation as long as it is progressive and positive. I still get significant =
information and good communications from them. They still have a helluva lo=
t more insight than most of the living critics I run into from time to time=
.

Anyway, don't get off your path or distracted by this crap Frank. You ha=
ve too much important work to do. I received a file for you the other day t=
alking about spaceships again. They called you Sumption though and talked a=
bout shaving off your balls. Misty and I thought it was funny. Another atte=
mpt at making you more feminine...LOL

Regards,

Frank R.

            Hey Frank-R;



Yahoo marked yo=
ur message as spam, and I can't go approve it from here at 

work. But anyw=
ay, I don't know if I should name names, in an attempt to be a 

nicer bitc=
h. I don't get it, I made the damn things, gave them away free, 

yet I can=
't be trusted to fix it, or at least verify the box works for me. I 

think=
 there may indeed be a limit, or at least a certain state of mind for 

use=
rs. So I guess these people are left with ugly little door stops? I tried 
=

to e-mail  but one e-mail came back, the other ignored,  so I'm thinkin' 
=

blocked maybe, which does not show they are anymore honest then the user 
=

they all hate------without naming names. BTW-Steve's not one of these 

pe=
ople.



This probably sounds vague, but they know who they are, and I don'=
t get a 

response any other way, so probably a mis-use of the group, sorta=
.



I didn't realize just how crappy car tuners were until I got the homeb=
rew 

tuner working. I don't have anywhere near the static and noise in the=
 HB 

tuner.
