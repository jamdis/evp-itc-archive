We were just too well shielded for the boxes to\n&gt; scan properly.  I had on hand my Frank’s Ghost Box 22, Ron \nRicketts’\n&gt; very first Mini-Box to come out of production, the Radio Shack Hack,\n&gt; and a Craig’s Box, a modified Daewoo car stereo done by Craig \nTelesha.\n&gt;  In addition, I had a gold-beryllium alloy antenna made by Marcus \nLeader.\n&gt; \n&gt; There’s no doubt about it, the box technologies and spirit\n&gt; communication are hot topics, and will continue to be in the\n&gt; spotlight, especially as more people are able to obtain a device. \n&gt; Hopefully, this will lay to rest the nonsense about a “circle \nof 30”\n&gt; or any such ridiculous claims of monopoly on who can and should use\n&gt; boxes.  Box technology is already democratic.  As more people obtain\n&gt; and work with them, many possibilities for coordinated research and\n&gt; experiments will unfold.\n&gt; \n&gt; As an interdimensional interface, the boxes are neutral.  They are \nnot\n&gt; dark, demonic, negative, etc., as some fearful people worry.  \nNegative\n&gt; experiences are always possible, just as in any work in the\n&gt; paranormal.  People who don’t know what they are doing, who are \nin it\n&gt; for a lark, and who harbor fears and anxieties about the paranormal\n&gt; are not well-suited to any kind of paranormal exploration, whether\n&gt; it’s with a box, in automatic writing, or with a deck of Tarot \ncards.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rick Moran, the executive director of the Association for the study \nof\n&gt; Unexplained Phenomena, the sponsors of the research for the Mini-\nBox,\n&gt; shared some observations with me after the show that illuminate the\n&gt; topic.  Here are his comments:\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a connection between every one of the designers/technicians\n&gt; who have worked on the box from its inception by Spiricom. Every one\n&gt; of them was a licensed Ham Radio Operator, including Frank, Ron and\n&gt; Myself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Someone asked about different antennas… because of the Ham \nconnection,\n&gt; that has been done already. The original Spiricom was an enormous\n&gt; device and operated on the ham bands because it was the only part of\n&gt; the spectrum that could offer a clear channel. They tried both\n&gt; vertical and horizontal antennas. We did the same in our early\n&gt; devices, both Ron and I have “antenna farms” as do many of \nthe ASUP\n&gt; investigators, who are also hams.\n&gt; \n&gt; Spiricom sounded very robotic, due in part to the equipment being\n&gt; used… tubes and crystals to set the frequency. This was common\n&gt; practice through the 1980s.  I recently heard someone spouting a\n&gt; theory that because the Spiricom used a crystal system, it was \nsomehow\n&gt; mystical in nature. Crystals were used in all ham radios, all \nmilitary\n&gt; radios and a lot of commercial applications… nothing mystical at \nall.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I think Frank dropped the crystal frequency generation due to cost \nin\n&gt; favor of a plain old radio tuner he pulled from an old receiver. \nMost\n&gt; of his designs were admittedly adaptations of junk radios, which is\n&gt; what separates his from ours. We spared no expense in designing\n&gt; circuits that were critical to a clean signal.\n&gt; \n&gt; In your discussion last night, George did not even mention the EARTH\n&gt; SOUNDS project at NASA on the Ultra Low Frequency Bands. Down there\n&gt; NASA has been hearing “voices” for years, which they admit, \nthey can’t\n&gt; explain. As you might have already guessed, that is one of our\n&gt; upcoming projects. The great problem there is the length of the\n&gt; antenna, to do it right an ULF antenna would be buried and would be\n&gt; about 11 MILES long.  In the production model of the MiniBox, Ron \nhand\n&gt; tuned the antennas, winding row upon row of fine wire to match the\n&gt; necessary length of the frequencies being scanned, another \ndifference\n&gt; that helped to eliminate noise and upgrade the voice quality.\n&gt; ____\n&gt; Thanks, Rick.  And thanks to Frank, Ron, Craig, Marcus and all the\n&gt; other researchers in the ITC field.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rosemary\n&gt;"}
