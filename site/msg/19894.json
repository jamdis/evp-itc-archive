If my guys are honest, there isn&#39;t enough time left for anything petty. \n\nF-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;draiga1&quot; &lt;mail@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am so sorry to hear this, Frank. And I can&#39;t imagine what would possess anyone to try to send any of this type of research to anyone&#39;s job! That is just plain wrong! This research isn&#39;t entirely accepted among the paranormal folks yet, let alone people who aren&#39;t open to aliens, ghosts, or any other unusual things.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your box is what started this aspect of research for me. I saw it used on a tv show, and wanted one of my own! I still don&#39;t have a Frank&#39;s box, but feel honored to be on this list with you, and hear the files you&#39;re getting. I don&#39;t understand the nuts and bolts of building a Frank&#39;s box, Steve&#39;s box or Rich&#39;s box, but I am so glad that you guys are out their pushing the envelope in making better and better communication between us and the unseen. \n&gt; \n&gt; There are always going to be people who are set in their own ideas, and not accept anything new. Didn&#39;t they used to think the earth was flat? But then there are always going to be pioneers who know there&#39;s more than meets the eye, and keep working at it no matter who says otherwise. It&#39;s the pioneers of any field that allow new discoveries and allow us all to grow from their efforts. Anyway, that&#39;s my 2 cents, and I hope you stay on the list, even if you take a break for awhile.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~Draiga\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Well, for one thing, I don&#39;t own the group anymore. Due to one of these incessent argurments, I had to back away from this some years ago as I almost got fired becuase yet someone else that thought they knew so much more forwarded all my e-mails to my boss. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Then someone else seemed to be insinuating that I may have tampered with the imgaes. Very insulting. This stuff goes on an on, regardless of the quality of voices, or the images. I have reached my saturation point. There seems to be nothing more to be gained by presenting anything else. Now, I can sympatize with Richard Roberts!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  The group will continue, as there are a number of box and paranormal experts here that are more than happy to tell everyone what this stuff really is and how it works. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  I didn&#39;t mean to create bad any feelings.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  F-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
