So which is \nit, false communication, which is no commnunication, or is it evil \nspirits. To make it worse, this idiot implies he has the backing of \nthe -------, and the church believes we are letting evil into the \nworld. I took this as a severe slap to the face, very insulting to \nme, and every paranormal researcher in the world. He claims the &#39;real \nvoices&#39; he gets are made out of white noise combined with broadcast \nfragments. Duffus!! That is exactly the kind of voices the living \nmind creates to get the voices it wants to hear. Yet only his are the \nreal voices! My old friend, you can take your &#39;serious session&#39; and \nyour bishop, and shove &#39;em. My apoplogies to the group, but I know \nthis will get forwarded, and this bozo finds me so easy to dismiss, \nthat normal e-mail would be useless. I had to cut some out for nice \nsakes.
