Boy you hit on my big question...who is it communicating at the other end...how are they organized...are they restricted from telling us certain things...and of course where are they.  Once we accept that the messages are real and not from other "living humans" then all these other questions come up.  It seems that if we restrict our questioning to "spiritual" issues the communications flows.  
   
  I am also wondering what happened to the techinical type communications that the old Spiritcom pioneers used to get.  Still would like to hear an answer to what causes autism in children?  What's the harm in answering that question?   Ron L

Couple pretty good files in here, sorry for the cursing file. That 
makes this more real to me and they know that. I don't believe they 
curse because they don't like me, i think they know i post the audio 
for others to hear and want to prove their existence. I also got 
the "Are We Dead?" file. That maybe the first clear message that's 
relevant to what we are doing, it must be grounded spirits asking 
that. If anyone has any thoughts of who would say that, it may be 
another discussion. Maybe it's not grounded spirits, but whom than?
