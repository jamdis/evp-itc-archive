Hi Deb.=C2=A0 I'm not trying to make any claims: I'm trying to determine wh=
at the claims are for the Frank's box.=C2=A0 And so I was asking the creato=
r of the Frank's box, and then summarizing.

The fact th=
at the operator CAN and DOES make recordings and files of
understandable wo=
rds and phrases shows that we are dealing with an
OBJECTIVE rather than a s=
ubjective phenomenon here. Two things appear
to be going on though. 

First=
 there is an actual voice modulated signal. Different people who
listen to =
it often hear the same thing. The sound is not perfect and is
very noisy, s=
o that would explain others who cannot hear the message.

The second thing =
is that some people can listen to the noise as a
"random field", and with a=
 slightly altered state of mind, this field
will induce latent "mediumship"=
 ability in the operator and he or she
will get a lot more information and =
voice material than another
listener.

            

Note that the content =
random fields have little or nothing in common
with whatever imagery or sou=
nds may be percieved from them. They simply
enhance the user to access psyc=
hic information that, while even not
being a "psychic" allows him to get in=
fo normally innaccessable to
him/her.

If there is any objective percieved =
sound similar to what is heard by
others impressed upon the background nois=
e, it might be due to the
spirit who is speaking being PRESENT. That entity=
 would then be able to
get the message through to the operator Psychicly on=
 another level.
that the words are also in the noise would be a co-incidenc=
e.

            

I work with VISUAL random fields---The imagery, while cle=
ar, is formed
in my mind/eye system , so I cannot photograph it. Some of th=
is EVP
background noise may be working the same way too---formed in the
Min=
d/EAR system. This is only heard by the primary operator and likely
cannot =
be recorded to a file. 

But some random field stuff IS objective--for exam=
ple, using a random
backdrop for ghost photos makes the ghosts easier to, a=
nd more often
appear in a photo. This is equavalent to the EVP that people =
can hear
on the recorded file.

            

I will discuss and explain ra=
ndom field theory itself, later, in its
own posting.
