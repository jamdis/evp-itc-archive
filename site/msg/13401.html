I have to admit that I thought I had seen the worst 'paranorma=

y worst expectations.
=A0
Generally, I respect John Oliver's work as a medi=
um. While I have no personal experience with him, in the past he has looked=
 and acted more genuine than not, the rolling of the eyes put aside for the=
 moment.
=A0
I do take exception to the characterization of the talking box=
 as an Edison device. I have documented the history of Edison, ITC and EVP=
=A0=A0elsewhere. This is however the smallest concern I have with this show=
.
=A0
Prior to wathcing I had just had a conversation with a respected coll=
eague on the West coast regarding interesting phenomena he and others are c=
onstantly observing in sites with phenomena similar to that on Door to the =
Dead. None of those measurements were made by this team. The use of thermal=
 in this situation is not indicated as well.
=A0
The real concern is that n=
o attempt was made to help this family in a broader context. The skeptic di=
d and said nothing skeptical as far as I could tell. Key questions were not=
 asked (at least on-camera) that would reveal the psycho-dynamics of this f=
amily. We know fairly well at this time that PK phenomena is often centered=
 on a focal person who can exhibit specific characteristics. That the team =
seems unaware of this is quite disturbing to a person like myself.
=A0
A re=
al research opportunity was lost in this case, as was an opportunity to edu=
cate the public on the right way to approach such situations. Continually s=
ending the messages that phenomena is based on 'demons' and 'spirits' exclu=
sively does nothing to further the position of serious investigators, which=
 is perhaps most troubling of all.
