There are\n&gt; many methods, many tools, and I would say the ghost box\n&gt; devices are a great tool to use.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Heres one I recorded recently doing sweep tuning on my fm\n&gt; card. Kind of pertains to this conversation and I was just\n&gt; sharing it with a friend. Attaching it to this post its too\n&gt; long of a filename wise to post here in file section.

That would reduce all of the\n&gt; &quot;ghost\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; phones&quot; to simply being tools rather than devices\n&gt; to\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; communicate with a spirit.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is a small group of us (paranormal\n&gt; investigators) in\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Muskegon, MI. We have had some interesting success\n&gt; with\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; photographs. In a month I am taking them in an\n&gt; entirely new\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; direction: using your body as a tool for ghost\n&gt; hunting. And\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; not for protection, either! LOL. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; This would fit right in with this idea of using some\n&gt; sort\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; of white noise...even in the field.Or at least, it\n&gt; will\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; give them something to really chew on! \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; (The Other) Al\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- &lt;alofbama@netscape. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; You&#39;re the only person I&#39;ve heard mention\n&gt; this, and\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; it makes me feel better knowing I&#39;m not crazy (at\n&gt; keast\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; totally). lol Long ago I noticed that running tap\n&gt; water\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; sometimes seems to sound like garbled speech. I never\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; tested this with a recorder, but I&#39;ve caught some\n&gt; evps\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; with refrigerator motors and other devices. Audacity\n&gt; has\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; the &quot;add white noise&quot; option, which allows\n&gt; you to\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; record directly to your computer and allow the\n&gt; entities to\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; organize the generic white noise. I&#39;m eager to try\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; that. An excellent observation you had, Misty. I think\n&gt; they\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; must grab hold of any babbling or whirring noise\n&gt; available\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; to communicate, whether we&#39;re able to pick it up\n&gt; or\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; not. That&#39;s why I carry around one of the\n&gt; lightweight\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Olympus recorders -- no telling where you&#39;re going\n&gt; to\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; find a babbling-brook or steady motor sound.
