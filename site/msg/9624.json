The founder of this board \n&gt; Mr. Frank Sumption has alway&#39;s made it clear that It is not a place \n&gt; for sceptics and they will not be tolerated. We are here to study and \n&gt; further real time soirit communication, not have to defend every post \n&gt; we make or file we add. I suggest you take your negative accusations\nand \n&gt; detrimental unfounded criticism and scepticism somewhere else. \n&gt;  \n&gt; You are wearing your welcome thin here, not to mention within 5 posts \n&gt; you have contradicted yourself three times. and went from the\nphilosophy \n&gt; of aliens enslaving human spirits to questioning any chance that\nthis method \n&gt; of spirit communication could or does exist and is a conspiricy to\nfool unsuspecting\n&gt; people like us by means of a super transmitter.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have learned by experience to try and keep this type of post\ncivil, So for any moderators that are reading this \n&gt; Please review the situation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: f1cracker75@...: Sat, 12 Apr 2008 19:24:11\n-0700Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re:First SuCcessful Recordings - Nathan\nre: Hoax\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nathan, I am amazed you would suggest or even think that!  I live in\nCary, North Carolina and record when I have the time. There is no set\nschedule, and when I turn my radio on and someone says hello Michael,\nor even shouts out &quot;Mike Edwards&quot;, or a spirit tells me I am holding a\ncarving in my hand, who would even know I turned the radio on? Only my\nwife knows I record, and we have kept this research from our children\nas well as our neighbors. So you are suggesting that Margaret, lets\nsay who lives where I do not know, is playing a joke on me with a high\ntech two way radio?\n&gt;  \n&gt; itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Nathan. I always look to relevance as a key in determining\nwhether or not something is appropriate to the session. If this were a\nhoax, I would then have to seek an explanation for how private\ninformation is known by the &#39;hoax perp&#39;, particularly information that\nwould require visual awareness. Some of us have examples of\nappropriate responses being given when asking things like, &quot;Can you\nname something nearby me?&quot; or &quot;Please tell me what I&#39;m holding in my\nleft hand.&quot; A sophisticated multi-transmission two way radio would not\nexplain answers which require &#39;visual&#39; information of some kind\n(though I&#39;ll be the first to admit my understanding of electronics is\nlimited but I&#39;m fairly confident on this aspect.) Of course, there is\nalways the chance that the person running the hoax is also, or in\npartnership with, an extremely talented remote viewer or psychic who\nis able to glean that visual information from the ether or the mind of\nthe experimenter. And what of those examples where people have\nconfirmed the sound of the voice being &quot;just like&quot; that of their loved\none in spirit? Surely the hoaxer isn&#39;t also able to mimic people&#39;s\nloved ones.If you are using EVP Maker with anything other than the\nallophones file, which contains no words to begin with, you are also\nrunning the possibility of &#39;false positives&#39; albeit they wouldn&#39;t be\nfrom a hoax. Again, I look to relevance to be key, and relevant info\nthat would not come easily to a stranger is even better. For example,\nI turned on my MiniBox for the very first time and said, &quot;Hello?&quot; and\nimmediately received the response, &quot;Hello Margaret.&quot; If this were a\nhoax, how could that person know in less than 10 seconds, who I was by\nname. I had not given this information out. Not to mention that you\nhave people experimenting 24/7 and receiving similar responses. How in\nthe world could an organization have the manpower, technology, or even\nthe desire, to attempt such a hoax? I mean that as a genuine inquiry,\nbecause there might be an explanation I have not thought of. I have\none example where, via radio sweep, my communicator was able to\ncorrectly identify the status and location of a missing person (who it\nturns out was alive and well, so we ended up with confirmation that\nthe info given had indeed been correct - which is much less\ncomplicated that trying to track and understand the clues when\nassociated with the dead, or missing but not found.) Again, if a hoax,\nwould that have simply been a lucky guess on the part of the\nhoaxer?Bottom line for me is ... have I wondered if it could be a\nhoax? Or simply a fortuitous tuning of the dial? Yes, on both\naccounts. But there is enough compelling evidence to rule out both of\nthem as an explanation for the far too many relevant examples received\nby so many of us.Good food for thought, but after digesting it, I&#39;d\nhave to say, &quot;No, a sophisticated hoax does not sufficiently explain\nthe phenomena on a large scale.&quot;Margaret--- In\nEVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Nathan Sharman &lt;v1230mail@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Has it\never occurred to you, that some one or&gt; organisation, could be using a\nradio to say the things&gt; you heard?&gt; &gt; This whole radio and spirit\nvoices, could be a MASSIVE&gt; HOAX, perpetuated by some one with a\nsophisticated&gt; multi-transmission two way radio.&gt; &gt; Think about it.&gt; &gt;\nTHAT IS WHY I USE EVPmaker only to commuincate with&gt; the other\ndimension.&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________&gt; Do\nYou Yahoo!?&gt; Tired of spam?
