&gt; I was in Radio Shack buying a couple batteries today for a couple 
of 
&gt; watches and noticed a radio that supplied AM/FM and Shortwave that 
also 
&gt; had an internal speaker.  I took a shot and brought it home and 
hacked 
&gt; it in a matter of minutes and was willing to take a chance for the 
sake 
&gt; of research.  Well it worked, it is model #20-125.  I took the 3 
screws 
&gt; out minus the antenna screw and opened it up.  I took away the top 
&gt; board and didn&#x27;t see much and seen a lower board below it.  No 
screws, 
&gt; they are held together by clips on the top and bottom of the 
board.  
&gt; The bottom board once removed has markings and you will look for 
the MU 
&gt; on the board.  The ribbon looks like a hardrive ribbon for a 
computer.  
&gt; It has glue covering the wires that you have to move away, i used a 
&gt; straight razor.  Once the wire is clean and able to be approached, 
cut 
&gt; it with the same straight razor. Just the wire marked MU for Mute. 
&gt; Close the unit up and your done. 
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps
&gt; 
&gt; Thanx,
