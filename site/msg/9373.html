<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I dunno gang. Everyone who knows me for any length of time knows that  
I have some real issues with the veracity of *some* of what went on  
during this time with this particular group. I was involved in the  
EVP community at the time and heard about it unfolding. I&#x27;m a  
journalist who specializes in things like behavioral science, so I am  
pretty capable of separating my own feelings and beliefs and hopes  
from facts. Before I get tarred again as a skeptic, I should also add  
that, at the time, I very much wanted everything emitting from this  
group to be true. All I can say is, I remain unconvinced that there  
wasn&#x27;t hoaxing going on *to some extent*. There was also genuine  
stuff happening. I&#x27;m not here to say what was what--I&#x27;m just saying,  
approach this with an analytical mind to make your own judgement.

I&#x27;m never popular for stating this, but I remain convinced of my own  
conclusions, although I am always open to any new evidence.

&gt; The communication was done not via radio, but telephone directly to
&gt; the researchers homes. There were numerous telephone calls made to
&gt; Maggy Harsch-Fishbach, Mark Macy and even to Sarah Estep. These phone
&gt; calls were made by members of the group on the Other Side working with
&gt; ITC researchers during the 1990&#x27;s. The group working with the ITC
&gt; researchers were guided by seven Ethereal beings on the Other Side
&gt; called The Seven. Contact was not only made via telephone, but also
&gt; fax and files placed in Maggy Fishbach&#x27;s computer. :)
&gt;
&gt; I highly recommend Mr. Macy&#x27;s book, Miracles In The Storm. He has much
&gt; of this information on his website. http://worlditc.org

&gt; &gt; &gt; That is the phone call made to Mark Macy by Konstantin Raudive.
