&gt;Cool Frank maybe you should go. It would be a great chance to try out one 
&gt;of the new boxes and get some orders for the prototypes. Orders=$$ for new 
&gt;parts.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Calling All Ghost Hunters and Ghost Lovers,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The National Ghost Hunters Getaway is proud to present
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;���The Shining��� Investigation
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;January 27th &amp; 28th 2007
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Join professional, amateur hunters and just plain ghost lovers as they
&gt; &gt;investigate the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, CO. This magnificent Hotel 
&gt;was
&gt; &gt;the inspiration to Stephen King���s ���The Shining��� and he himself spent time
&gt; &gt;there developing his horrific nightmare, that we still enjoy today. 
&gt;Granted
&gt; &gt;the spirits in his award winning book are more on the devilish side. The
&gt; &gt;hotel does house some of the less life threatening spooks and has 
&gt;possibly
&gt; &gt;done so shortly after its opening in 1909. This amazing structure offers
&gt; &gt;the ghost hunters a late night investigation as we venture into it���s
&gt; &gt;darkened halls and closed down facilities. The night may hold an eerie
&gt; &gt;silent chill, but who���s to say some spirits are just dieing to speak to 
&gt;an
&gt; &gt;unsuspecting ghost hunter. So spend the weekend learning what other ghost
&gt; &gt;hunters do, collecting evidence, sharing your findings or just make new
&gt; &gt;paranormal friends as we investigate the ghosts of Haunted Stanley Hotel.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Tickets for this event are $35 per person
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Rooms are $99 a night (double occupancy) for this special event
&gt; &gt;So please remember to let them know you are with the Ghost Hunters 
&gt;Getaway
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You will be responsible for your our own travel and hotel arrangements.
&gt; &gt;
