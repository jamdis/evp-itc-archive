<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The question, than 10 seconds and that&#x27;s it.  Anything else could be 
made to fit the researchers situation.  I cut out some crap that 
doesn&#x27;t belong, but i only wait 10 seconds before i ask my next 
question.

&gt; I agree with you totally, Juli.  I admit that I used to give 
upwards of 25 seconds between questions.  I&#x27;ve learned that if I&#x27;m 
going to get an answer, it usually comes a lot sooner than that, if 
not, then I&#x27;m not getting an answer at that time.  But that had to 
come with learning.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For those of you who are paranormal investigators alike, you know 
the first rule of thumb is NEVER edit your clips!  If you want to be 
taken serious in this field and not under a microscope with the 
question of whether or not you in fact did actually get a voice 
and/or response and that clip is edited, don&#x27;t bother putting it up 
for public display.  You can amplify it, take out the hiss, but you 
better not splice it in any way, cause your just asking for trouble.  
&gt;  
&gt; I had this very debate with Bruce long ago.  I know first hand that 
if in fact its edited many question your motives behind why you in 
fact would bother removing the dead airtime between.  The very first 
thing that came into question when editing EVP from Frank&#x27;s Box many 
moons ago (pun intended) that a certain person was in fact splicing 
his audio by putting the questions and response right after.  Many 
now consider him to be a fraud and this was just one of the reason 
built upon others as a direct result.  You are altering the clip, no 
ifs and or butts about.  It can therefore hurt your creditability as 
a researcher in the paranormal field.  Regardless with you save your 
original clips.  Everything you do comes into question.  You can 
clearly tell by the skip in rhythm as you play the audio vs the free 
flowing of the dial when it has been altered.  Real Time is real time 
people, not 15 seconds after the fact.  If you have to questions what 
you
&gt;  got....&quot;If in Doubt, throw It Out&quot;.
&gt;  
&gt; People, there is one thing that you have to remember.  The word of 
box research is spreading, and there are those who are implementing 
it as an additional tool on investigations.  This is not just some 
who are going to give up their current status as a ghost hunter to 
now slowly be a box researcher ( for that was never a thought for 
me).  I was hoping that through my research I could in fact 
incorporate it on my investigations.  Because of the radio fragments 
itself, there are many that do not support this research and believe 
we are reaching and grasping at nothing, and literally laugh when the 
subject of box research comes up.  Do you really want to give them an 
extra ammunition as splicing your clips?  I know myself that there is 
more that meets the eye in this line for communication, and I do 
stand proud and true of pursuing real time communication, myself, but 
cutting out the dead air is not just because you don&#x27;t want to listen 
to it, or you can&#x27;t
&gt;  fit it all is a lame excuse.  Use a different program!
&gt;  
&gt; I personally have questioned many on their clips and have to tell 
you that if you truly want to be considered as a professional 
paranormal investigator/ researcher that if you intend to use this 
protocol for you evp/box research clips, you stand to loose your 
creditability and the word fraud may just come into question.
&gt;  
&gt; However, if you have nothing to loose as far as your reputation and 
or not in it to prove anything to anyone, be my guest.  There are 
many here that are not involved in the paranormal field and a prefer 
evp-itc researcher vs. other areas of the super natural.  If they are 
not putting themselves out there for God and Country to see, and are 
only doing it for your personal results and curiosity, and can could 
careless with others thing, then clip away to your hearts content!  
&gt;  
&gt; Just remember, if someone who is currently studying evp and not box 
research sees and hears your clips, don&#x27;t be surprised, if they start 
questioning your motives and box research all together!
&gt;  
&gt; Just adding my 2 cents!

&gt; &gt; Stefan,

&gt; &gt; I do remove the &quot;garbage&quot; from my files.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; At this point in my research, the message is more important to me 
&gt; than the proof of it.
&gt; &gt; I think most of us here will agree that we are receiving some 
sort 
&gt; of paranormal communication.
&gt; &gt; but it definitely exists. now we need to concentrate on the 
&gt; messages they need us to hear and the answers to the questions
&gt; &gt; we ask and in turn our answers to their questions. Anyone that 
&gt; cleans a file in this way should not be touching any bit of the file
&gt; &gt; that has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously 
&gt; garbage like the &quot;EH O EH AH O EH UR&quot; in between words.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For example &quot;Is there anyone here that wishes to 
&gt; communicate_ YES_AH ER EEH AR OOO AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE&quot;
&gt; &gt; It is much easier for me as a researcher to be able to return to 
a 
&gt; file that I recieved two weeks ago and that I believe may hold some
&gt; &gt; relivence to a message I just received and be able to cleanly 
&gt; listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage sounds.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; At this stage in real time communication the messages are the top 
&gt; priority.
&gt; &gt; I do however agree that the untouched version should be retained 
&gt; and made available to individuals that make a request 
&gt; &gt; for any intelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that may 
&gt; be made, and god knows there are always fanatical 
&gt; &gt; sceptics lurking in the shadows awaiting an opportunity to attack 
&gt; an unwary or injured researcher. I do not think that 
&gt; &gt; our research files should be made available on request by every 
&gt; tom dick and harry that is unknown to us and may potentially
&gt; &gt; doctor the file to suit their own point and post it as such.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the 
&gt; researcher that receives the request for raw research data should 
&gt; &gt; scrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment 
&gt; before handing out any research data.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; These are my thoughts on the subject of cleaning a file.

&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Editing EVP
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I 
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a 
whole, 
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can 
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip 
&gt; (including
&gt; &gt; the experimenter&#x27; s voice), filter or denoise it to make it 
&gt; clearer, but
&gt; &gt; not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP 
&gt; match
&gt; &gt; with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should 
&gt; always
&gt; &gt; be provided along with the edited version.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But that&#x27;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to 
&gt; express, as
&gt; &gt; we should always be able to present our results to a critical 
&gt; public.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Stefan
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; -- 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these 
&gt; files.
&gt; &gt; &gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the 
&gt; message 
&gt; &gt; &gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise 
&gt; that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#x27;t belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can&#x27;t piece 
&gt; these 
&gt; &gt; &gt; files together to make something it&#x27;s not, so i keep them in 
&gt; true 
&gt; &gt; &gt; form pretty much to the original.
