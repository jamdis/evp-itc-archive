I agree!  I rarely post, but as I just wrote Frank under separate cover, it is all about respect!
  Respect for Frank, respect for the unknown, and the pure intentions that must go along with the right of ownership!  
   
  I could have had a box build long ago, but I can honestly tell you that if it didn't come under Franks direction, or the directions of the guilds, then to me I shouldn't have one.
   
  See what the others fail to see is the true mean of messages conveyed from these devises.  For the unknown to correspond these messages are of great importance, and not all people can not understand the depth in the meanings.  I can only hope that they do not work for those who are not worthy, and that those who shall come in possession who are sincere will utilize it in all position manners never expecting personal gain!

You gained your respect and credibility on the fact that you have a system that works and you are willing to give it away when you didn't have to Frank. This guy is coming out of the gate with a cheap imitation of EVP maker and your system (both of which are free) and putting a huge price tag on it. It just don't sit right with me!

Honestly, I know it is none of my business what Ron does but I guess I just needed to register my protest with this seemingly blatant attempt at exploiting good though naive people.

 Interesting. I can see the price for early models. This stuff take tons of time to put together. I don't want to fault anyone ---yet. I couldn't figure out how to sell the things, and keep it honest, but all that does is deny everyone from using it.

          $400 to $650 dollars a unit. This guy is retarded! If he is selling this unit, he doesn't get it Frank!

Yeah, I think this stuff is starting to take off with more users "getting it" and more people out there making different designs.
