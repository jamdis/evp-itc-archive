Described as brand new, box never opened, yada \nyada.  It arrived in seemingly perfect condition, and it took about a \nweek for us to get it through our pea brains that it wasn&#39;t holding a \ncharge. There was a lot going on around the house, and probably \nanother \ncouple of weeks went by before I decided it just needed a new \nbattery. \nSo I replaced the battery and got a cute little phone case to boot. \n\nYou might guess that the new battery didn&#39;t solve the problem.  By \nthis \ntime I had been in contact with the seller, who seemed genuinely \nsympathetic and suggested I send it back to Cingular/ATT since it was \nstill &quot;on warranty&quot; (yeah, right).  Instead, I sent it to an online \ncellphone repair company that promised they could repair any kind of \ndamage for $29.95.  Two weeks later they contacted me and said they \nwere very sorry but the phone had suffered irrepairable water damage, \nand they could dispose of it for me and give me a $15. credit towards \nmerchandise or send it back.  I had them send it back, probably just \nto \ntorment myself with the reminder that altogether I wasted close to \n$350.!!! I just kept digging the hole deeper and deeper..\n\nOh, I did contact Ebay and PayPal, but I had waited too long to file \na \nformal complaint with either company because I simply couldn&#39;t get it \nthrough my head that someone would misrepresent what they were \nselling.  \n\nSo my question is, IS IT TRUE A WATER-LOGGED CELLPHONE CAN&#39;T BE \nFIXED??  \n\nRobin"}
