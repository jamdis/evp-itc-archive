<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce &amp; All, I seem to be having the same problem . . . Asking for a &quot;Tech./Guide&quot; to show up and let me know who they are.  I&#x27;ve been getting many names, but maybe those are ones that want to say &quot;Hi&quot; &amp; who they are?!  I keep trying to record - daily or nightly.   =Judy=      ===============================                                --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:

&gt; Ann,
&gt;  
&gt; From what I can discern from mike and Lisa&#x27;s communication regarding techs/guardians
&gt; is that a tech is assigned to a researcher here on earth based on their compatible energy and harmonic vibration.
&gt; That is not so easy to do, so every time you do a session there is a temp assigned for that particular session.
&gt;  
&gt; Give it some more time and keep asking but I&#x27;m sure when you do get yours it will be a special relationship.
&gt;  
&gt; In other words you have to kiss the exact right frog for him to turn into your prince aah or princess 
&gt;  
&gt; I will keep the subject open with mike and Lisa until I get a definitive answer or you do.

&gt; 
&gt; Hmmmm. That second bit gave me the creepies, I must say. What are your thoughts on that, Bruce? I hear Lisa&#x27;s name at least a dozen times each time I run a session, so I feel confident that she is there, so I feel confident that I&#x27;m not in the hands of someone I don&#x27;t want to be in. Maybe they are still auditioning for the role?
