IHe was missing for 4 days and on Friday I went to the pound and found that he had been struck by a car (the first night he didn&#39;t come home). Severe spinal injury and they had to give him the shot. I asked about him (on the other side)...well seems like they don&#39;t have the answers either. Glad tjey heard me though.....maybe he does too. Gonna miss him. \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Jim%27s%20RR-DR60%20EVP%27s/I_dont_know-evp.mp3 \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/general.htmlfiles\n\nRegards,\n\nclockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt;"}
