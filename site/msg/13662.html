I have not personally met Chris Moon, but he is from Colorado and I am in C=
olorado, so I do hear alot about him, unfortunately mostly negative. So for=
 me, he does have a big red flag, but I try to just tuck it away until I ha=
ve the chance to meet and work with him personally.

I have seen him on TV =
Shows, and again, I wasn't "feeling the love" so to speak LOL! But as you s=
aid, that is TV, so I try to keep that in mind as well.

   Yeah, I'm sure it it the same. I was hesitant to put tha=
t up. Chip and Chris both work ion those shows for TruTV. I don't wnat to s=
ound too negative about Moon, I think the Edison thing ios fro show, and Ch=
ris cleim I told him it was Edison's invention, which I don't remember. Obv=
iously his claims that there's only 30 users allowed, and he's the only one=
 that can interpret the box has been proven wrong. I think Chirs Moon is a =
good man, at least in person, and this other stuff has more to do with putt=
ing on shows.

       I rarely=

kinda iffy."Princess, I never Liked that box..." is the same on as "Princes=
s I love that box...", I just hear it different this morning. That's the on=
ly one I hear different from last night. I included the forward, and revers=
e components. 

       These are from the test I did to see if I could use =
a pre-recorded RAW audio tape in areas wherer there's no radio stations, si=
ncve many insist on going to "haunted locations" that have few, if any radi=
o stations to use for the raw audio. #48 has an aux input so other raw audi=
o can be used.
