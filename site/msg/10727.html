Thanks a million Frank for the reply.  I was wondering on how the systems w=
ithout echo chambers that are hooked to direct output of an audio jack work=
ed  and if the spirits were indeed interacting with the electronic internal=
s.  I figured the box was there to enhance communication of cleaner evp of =
sorts.  I've used several different size boxes and materials as well, but I=
 haven't tried copper yet.  I've used copper on other projects thought and =
had great success.  I don't know why I haven't tried in on this one.  I wil=
l have to run down to the hardware store for some materials and build a 4x6=
 as you suggested.  I used a basic plastic box to help with noise filtering=
 from outside influence but I was wondering about it's effects.  That's ver=
y interesting mentioning the different levels of interaction based on mater=
ial.  I'm going to have to run some tests based on the different echo boxes=
 I have and see what happens for me.  Hopefully I'll get as good
 results a=
s others as long as I keep plugging away at it.   I believe your right thou=
gh, I don't want to drive myself nuts trying to figure it out, especially o=
vernight.

All the best,
Bryan

I gu=
ess there is form of mechanical filtering going on. I think the 
term echo =
box is probably incorrect to discribe it's function. These 
system do not n=
eed the sound chamber to work, like the Mini box, or 
hack radios, it seems=
 the entites work mostly inside the 
electronics. I even added direct mode =
to my boxes, an output that 
comes out of the tuner, and just through a pre=
-amp to bring it up to 
about one volt level for recording. You can record =
directly from the 
headphone jack of any of these systems, where there is n=
o air 
vibration, and you still get voices. The "echo box" seems to enhance=
 
the voices, but I have no idea how. Size does not seem to be a major 
fac=
tor. I have used boxes from almost as small as a pack of 
cigarettes, up to=
 four feet long. The material seesms to matter, 
with galvanized sheet meta=
l scrap, I get mostly spirit voices, with 
aluminum foil I get my ET guys, =
and with copper, it seems to be 
higher spirits, but I've only used it once=
 so far. I have made boxes 
in the form of an orgone accumulator, that is l=
ayered cotten, and 
steel screen. it seems like everything works, and there=
 is one level 
or another that will use wiaht you're using at any particula=
r 
moment. That's why I say there are no absolutes, no rules. They use 
wha=
t we use. It'll make ya nutz if you try to nail it down. I don't 
have the =
intellect, nor the education to figure this stuff out, so I 
run entirely o=
n intuition.  Cut and try is my favoite method.

Peraonlly I prefer an echo=
 box with 1 inch sqaure channels, two or 
three channels running lengtwise =
in 4 X 6 (very approximate) inch 
box. 

All the current boxes run in both =
modes, direct or with the echo 
box/sound chamber.
