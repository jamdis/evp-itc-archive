 Way cool, and pretty clear. Moon said both Tesla and Edison were working on machines. There&#x27;s people out there beating up Chris, but he keeps getting validated! That&#x27;s why I had to go back to work wiht him. I&#x27;m, an old crank, but I won&#x27;t let ego crap get inthe way---and I trust my intuition. 
 
 There&#x27;s some that believe life continues on thre other side pretty much as we are here, and &quot;they&quot; are as physical there, and we are here. Not the whisps of energy the paranormal experts would have us believe.

Trying a new technique on th computer using editing software called Sound Soap 2. I discovered a way to do a manual forward/reverse sweep of any audio file. Here is an example from last night. The effect is somewhat like EVP maker and exibits some layering.&quot;I&#x27;m down in Chicago on Tesla&#x27;s device alive!...Edison, should never meddle&quot;Dave
