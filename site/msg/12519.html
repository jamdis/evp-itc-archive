<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The ghost boxes work better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. I have a  
mini and one of Frank&#x27;s originals and they both are fantastic. After  
that, I had the most success with reel-to-reel. But using the boxes  
with a digital recorder and proper audio software is worlds beyond  
what we used to do in the 1980s.

&gt; &gt; Yes--Sarah used reel-to-reel and occasionally cassette. I bought
&gt; my
&gt; &gt; first reel-to-reel from her husband, back in the day. Sarah had a
&gt; &gt; bunch of them and her husband was always looking for them at yards
&gt; &gt; sales to pass onto AAEVP members. He&#x27;d get them and fix them up. I
&gt; &gt; still have the one he got for me. I used several back them myself
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; had three or four when I had to pause in taping for the birth of
&gt; my
&gt; &gt; son. It took me many years to get back to it...

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi All, Been awhile since I&#x27;ve posted here, but was wondering
&gt; about
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; methods Sarah used with her reel to reel tape recorder (Technics
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt; Teac model - anyone know which???) as it seems she got MANY Spirit
&gt; &gt; &gt; voices or EVP&#x27;s this way. Not to knock, Frank&#x27;s Boxes or other
&gt; Ghost
&gt; &gt; &gt; Boxes! Just a though! I may have an opportunity to get a $160.
&gt; &gt; &gt; refurbised Teac or Technics reel to reel tape recorder, but am
&gt; &gt; &gt; wondering IF I should get it or not (it&#x27;s a 1970&#x27;s model
&gt; appearently)!
&gt; &gt; &gt; Comments/ideas? Thanks! =Judy= 8-D

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi, Lisby! Were you able to get some EVP&#x27;s on any of those
&gt; recorders? Was it too time consuming to even get one or two? Just
&gt; wondering IF I should just stick to cassettes &amp; Sony, and my digital
&gt; recorder? =Judy=
