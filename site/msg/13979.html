I know this device caters more towards robotics interfaces, but I was wondering if anyone had ideas on how this could be used with box or speakjet projects? I was thinking it could be used (as there are several RNG projects floating around out there based of varying modes of this platform) as a random source for tuning and speakjet inputs.

I suppose you could also use it to interface sensor triggering. Seems like a cool idea, I think I will order one next payday.

thanks
