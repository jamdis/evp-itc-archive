Yep great files Bruce. Glad its working out well for you. Sometimes the clarity can be amazing =)
   
  How close to his voice was it in contrast to the voice you once recognized? I find that now and then they come thru with the original voice or tenor and characteristics.

Hi All;

I been sick as hell for ten days, and just starting to recover. One thing I 
rarely do is stop building boards long enough the use my own equipment for 
testing, and actually ask questions like this. I do have a Linear mode only 
system now, and almost have the Linear/RVG/Manual system in a box, I was 
able to work on it for several hours last night.
