I also heard someone in the \nbackground singing &quot; Happy Birthday &quot; too. How cool is that, no \ncoincidence seems like to me. Here is another story I was watching TV \nthe Grammy Awards and when Little Richard and Jerry lee Lewis was on \nthere was another singer with them from Credence Clearwater Revival I \ncouldn&#39;t remember his name. So as I was listening to the spirits I \nheard a voice today say &quot; John Fogerty &quot; is that his name I think it \nis? How cool was that ? Oh well just some stuff to ponder on. You all \nhave a great evening.\n\nRegards,\n\nRalph the Ghost Hunter"}
