A show that i had no knowledge of be=
rading me and frank for an hour. At least they could have had us on to defe=
nd ourselves. Not knowing what we do at all, most of what they said is base=
d on conjecture and 100% false.



Listen for yourself and see. David Rount=
ree is a huge piece of crap and adds nothing to any field or life for that =
matter. If you see a picture of him, you would want to punch him repeatedly=
.....at least that's how i feel.



Dr. Rorke i thought was a good guy, but=
 he's no better than the other skepdickheads.
