<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Oh dear. Here we go again.

Look, Babs--it&#x27;s really just this simple: if you are scared of lower  
entities and you think that the hacked radio you are using is really  
a channel for demon or whatever, then just stop. Put the fricking  
radio down and go get another hobby. Leave it to those of us who  
aren&#x27;t afraid and don&#x27;t care if someone calls us a bitch or a slut  
and tries to pawn themselves off as Bazoozoo.

Just. Stop. Listening. And. Worrying.

And on top of all that, in this quote below, you seem to be saying  
that the rest of us don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re doing or are being fooled  
by entities that only you have sussed. Guess what? You&#x27;re wrong on  
both counts, HMO.

&gt; I&#x27;ve recently started analyzing a 40 min 469 session. The results are
&gt; scary. I&#x27;d say at this point, and I&#x27;m only 1/2 way through, 90% of the
&gt; communication is negative in nature and mentions many supposed Demonic
&gt; names. The layers of voices are, in many cases, multiple. Often, the
&gt; listener hears very little of what is actually said. The voices can be
&gt; mocking or downright crude. I have not yet formed an opinion fully but
&gt; it would seem to me that these models are easy devices for lower level
&gt; entities to figure out how to use. I can not speak of the attitudes or
&gt; fears of those investigators present although at times, their voices
&gt; are a bit shaky.
