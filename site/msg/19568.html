I'm working with a=

=C2=A0
Getting images from our audio an=

 as suggested will allow our depth of communication to extend so much=C2=A0=
further than it has prior to this...almost like a conscious mind (GBC, surf=
ace messages) and the subconscious mind (sound/audio imaging and everything=
 that lies beneath the surface) sort of thing. 
=C2=A0
I really get a good,=
 STRONG feeling about this. It seems so obvious! =C2=A0
