we 20MB :)
&gt; 
&gt; I realized that you might want to see the other pages of this chapter.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of them are a little fuzzy,again because of the age of the
book, it was difficult to get some of the pages flat.
&gt; 
&gt; I could still read them so you guys should be able to.
&gt; 
&gt; You might have to download them so you can rotate the image though.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ll uploaded those pages later.

&gt;             Thanks Don!  Though I expect the quality would be better
with the
&gt; 
&gt; scanner, I am able to read what you uploaded after zooming in a couple
&gt; 
&gt; times, and with no other processing of the jpg.  So I think if you go
&gt; 
&gt; this route, it would work.

&gt; &gt; Rather than risk the scanner and the bending required, I thought
&gt; 
&gt; about using my camera.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I tried taking a single page at a time but even in Macro mode, the
&gt; 
&gt; type was out of focus.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So I just uploaded 4 pages (2 pages per image) of my first attempt
&gt; 
&gt; with the camera.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I wanted to know if it was good enough. If so, I&#x27;ll redo those and
&gt; 
&gt; the remaining pages with brighter light and keeping my thumb out of
&gt; 
&gt; the picture :))
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If if it not good enough then I&#x27;ll try the scanner. Although I was
&gt; 
&gt; able to read them just fine so it should be good enough.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Let me know,

&gt; 
&gt; jpg&#x27;s hardly any space taken up there (the file section is the one
&gt; 
&gt; thats always full) and if it sets our limit over then I am sure we can

&gt; post it other places as well like esnips.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I found the book.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is called &quot;The Diary and Sundry Observations of Thomas Alva
&gt; 
&gt; Edison&quot; the copyright for the edition I have is 1948. Since only a
&gt; 
&gt; limited number of 1st printings have Chapter 8, &quot;The Realms Beyond&quot;,
&gt; 
&gt; then I suspect 1948 would be the date of the first printing.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Each chapter ends with the year Mr. Edison wrote it (it is primarily
&gt; 
&gt; his diary). The part about spirit communication is dated 1922.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Obviously a 61 year old book is a bit fragile so I&#x27;ll start trying
&gt; 
&gt; to scan those pages but I&#x27;m not going to hurt the book for it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I suppose I just post them as JPGs in an email? There is not a
&gt; 
&gt; place to upload files here is there? Well I know there is but I
&gt; 
&gt; thought we were not supposed to use it.

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the link! Very interesting. I went to Edison&#x27;s place down
&gt; 
&gt; here in Florida in search of any information on the subject.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I found nothing. It was rumored that the executors of the estate had
&gt; 
&gt; anything of the sort removed.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I lost both my grandad and an uncle last month. People change their
&gt; 
&gt; minds about the afterlife. I&#x27;ve seen it first hand!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; How old was Edison when this article was written?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have one of a handful of the Edison Autobiography that has the
&gt; 
&gt; last chapter with his thoughts on the great beyond. His family had
&gt; 
&gt; that version of the biography recalled and reissued it without the
&gt; 
&gt; last chapter.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyway in this last chapter, Edison alludes to a way to communicate
&gt; 
&gt; with the dead but he never says he did it. He simply hypothesizes on
&gt; 
&gt; how it could be done and the fact that the dead are just on a
&gt; 
&gt; different wavelength than the living.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sorry, no links... This is from that old fashioned thing called a
&gt; 
&gt; book :))
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I can tell you how to find your own copy though if you wish. I need
&gt; 
&gt; to find the actual page count from my copy but I went to amazon&#x27;s used
&gt; 
&gt; books and asked every seller how many pages their copy was. The first
&gt; 
&gt; one to respond with the correct (bigger) number, that was the one I
&gt; 
&gt; bought.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Don
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; PS but don&#x27;t
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  spend alot. The info in the last chapter is not worth much.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I suppose ultimately, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if Edison made a
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; telephone to the dead or not. Modern researchers in this field will
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; have to stand on their own results anyway, and if they&#x27;ve managed to
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; discover something that Edison never achieved, good for them!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have also heard varied claims: that Edison did make this box; that
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Edison was working on it but never finished it; that Edison was joking
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; when he mentioned working on it. So for my own sake, I&#x27;d like to know
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; the real story.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you have a link to where you got your information from his
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; assistants and staff, I would really like to read it. Please make
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; sure it is as close to the source material as possible, and not
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; someone quoting someone quoting an article. For example, here is a
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; link to the actual New York times article on Edison discussing his
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; views of life after death:

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; That is the kind of link I&#x27;d be hoping for regarding your statements.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks for any info.
