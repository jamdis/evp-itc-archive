It was great to meet him and Deborah Preece after knowing them both for so long online! They are both as passionate about this subject as I am.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also uploaded some fantastic evp I recorded on the 4th of July out in my yard alone (if one is ever really alone LOL I think the voices contradict that statement). Almost all voices were quite loud and clear for my ears and required no filter or enhancement.You can listen to themhere:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.esnips. com/web/NewEVPVo ices\n&gt; \n&gt; Enjoy!\n&gt; Misty\n&gt;"}
