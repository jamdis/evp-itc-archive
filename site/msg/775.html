theres a few factors that are bringing people. Movies and ghost hunting.
whats cool is that each generation is more open minded and willing to explore what has been taboo in genrations past. Then as people are discovering what is available and what you are capable of, they talk about it, gaining more intrest in friends and those doing web sites etc. There is a HUGE following on myspace of people that ghost hunt and do EVP and ITC.
