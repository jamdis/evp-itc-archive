You should be able to \nsee the buzzing on a scope, and trace it back. One problem I did find is \nthat the audio limiter tends to increase the noise level. I think it&#39;s gain \njumps up when no voice fragments are present, and over amplifies the noise \nbetween stations, the result is a contant noise level that buries the \nvoices, but it&#39;s not like that buzz. I bypassed the limiter in box #12, and \nit works so good, I left the circuit off the newest system.\n\nFrank\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Craig&quot; &lt;fletchfx@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Picking up someone named Steve on Ghost Box 23L\n&gt;Date: Mon, 13 Aug 2007 19:25:29 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;Hello Frank,\n&gt;\n&gt;    Thanks for mentioning the buzzing, I was hoping the buzzing wasn&#39;t\n&gt;part of the design :-) I&#39;ll get a scope on it and check it out, I\n&gt;didn&#39;t want to mess with it for fear that I might be changing\n&gt;something that was intended for communication in the circuit.\n&gt;\n&gt;During the session we did change the location of the box because of\n&gt;all of the buzzing thinking it may have been some noisy wiring nearby,\n&gt;but it did not make a difference, so we just went with it.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks\n&gt;Craig T\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Craig;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That buzzing is awful! I can&#39;t hear much beyond that. If anyone can,\n&gt;have a\n&gt; &gt; tech check the power supply voltages at the board, there should be\n&gt;plus and\n&gt; &gt; minus 12 volts for the RVG, and pus 12 for the audio/tuner section.\n&gt;Look at\n&gt; &gt; it with a scope, maybe there a bad regulator, or bad power switch\n&gt;section.\n&gt; &gt; The way it is, that box is about useless.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Messenger Caf� � open for fun 24/7.
