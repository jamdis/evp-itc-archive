I did buy a 20-125, and hacked it correctly, and I didn't like it. I 
also didn't get very much reception. The 20-125 has a long anntena, 
and the 12-469 you can hold it in your hand, and you act as the 
anntena. That way you get better reception. Only problem with the 
12-469 is that it clicks a little, but I can't hear it anymore. I 
train not to hear it.
