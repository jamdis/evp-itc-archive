Here's a way to look at your specific method.=C2=A0 You say that David gave=
 you the answer.=C2=A0 But, you were not able to hear it, or would not acce=
pt it, until I told you what it was.=C2=A0 That would sound like a frustrat=
ing situation for David, and you.=C2=A0 But, this experiment could in theor=
y help there, by making it more clear to you when you have heard a valid me=
ssage, versus when you have imposed your own prejudices into the sound (as =
in this case, you said you did not believe a radio could fit on the monitor=
).=C2=A0=C2=A0 So in your methodology this would be of benefit both to you =
(because you could improve your skills through these experiments) and to Da=
vid (as he would not have to have you miss what he was saying as often).

Well, the problem =

they can read t=
he minds of each other, only the ones in lower plains are not 
able to read=
 the minds of those higher spirits if they choose to not reveal 
themselves=
.=C2=A0 Because of this it's going to be tough, if I gave everyone's 
opini=
on out of the 4 minutes, you could write a book, then when I found Dave's 
=
voice, he was not so easy to hear, I had to make it louder, when I tried to=

      I think it does matter though. 

One of the things 
      =
  we're trying to do is set up an objective framework for experimenting 
  =
      with some of these aspects.=C2=A0 I think we have all experienced the=
 
        difficulty in hearing what is on some of these recordings: someti=
mes 
        we're not sure at first what it says. Sometimes we ask others =
for their 
        input.=C2=A0 Sometimes we only hear it once someone else=
 tells us it 
        first.=C2=A0 Sometimes we hear it wrong.=C2=A0 Someti=
mes we hear it 
        right. And so on.

It would be useful to know, as a=
n individual, 
        how good we are at hearing it right, so we have some=
 idea how 
        trustworthy our skill, or methods, or technology, is.=C2=
=A0 If we can 
        measure that, or even get a feel for it, we can look=
 for ways to improve 
        it.=C2=A0 If we can't measure it, then we cou=
ld be stuck.=C2=A0 
        

So, by restricting the answers only to the ti=
meframe of the 
        experiment, we can help filter out some of the prob=
lems of subjectivity: 
        for example, one theory is that people can h=
ear what they want to hear, 
        or can these sounds in a certain way, =
once you already know the 
        answer.=C2=A0 Or, given 2 ways to hear a=
 sound, being influenced, even 
        subconsciously, to hear it one way =
over the other.=C2=A0 We want to rule 
        that out.

This is one reaso=
n we can only count on answers given 
        during the timeframe.=C2=A0 T=
hat is when the answer is most 
        objective.=C2=A0 Once the object ha=
s been announced, we move into 
        a=C2=A0 period where we can't disco=
unt possible influence from already 
        knowing the answer.

But, I am=
 confident that if a person's method 
        or technology really can reve=
al the correct answer outside the 
        timeframe, then doing it within =
the timeframe should be just as easy, 
        and would then be a valid ob=
jective result for all to see.

If you recall,

     on 7/10/2010 I placed an object on top of my

              =
                  time. The experiment was for participants to 
           =

     =
                           wouldn't be counted (for example, just colors,

In order to

                                the Files section (=
RJ folder) of this group. If 
                                you can follo=
w the link, it is here:

                                RJ/RJ.=
20100710. 1.zip

The idea was 
                                that you cou=
ld download the file at the 
                                beginning of t=
he test, and 'keep it safe' on 
                                your comput=
er. Then at the end of the test, I 
                                would r=
elease the password so you could reveal 
                                th=

    control of the original image during the entire

          test, not me. 

The password for that file

           is: 123BlastOff
Instructions, if you need 
                     =
           them, are also in that RJ folder.

And if 
                     =
           you did not care to download the zip file before 
              =

            =

So to the results:

So what do the

                  object. We can't say those theories or methods 
         =

  You say that David gave you the answer.  But, you were not able=
 to hear it, or would not accept it, until I told you what it was.  Th=
at would sound like a frustrating situation for David, and you.  But, =
this experiment could in theory help there, by making it more clear to you =
when you have heard a valid message, versus when you have imposed your own =
prejudices into the sound (as in this case, you said you did not believe a =
radio could fit on the monitor).   So in your methodology this wo=
uld be of benefit both to you (because you could improve your skills throug=
h these experiments) and to David (as he would not have to have you miss wh=
at he was saying as often).<br><br>--- On <b>Wed, 7/14/10, SnowfireL@...=

      =
  we're trying to do is set up an objective framework for experimenting 
  =
      with some of these aspects.  I think we have all experienced the=
 
        difficulty in hearing what is on some of these recordings: someti=
mes 
        we're not sure at first what it says. Sometimes we ask others =
for their 
        input.  Sometimes we only hear it once someone else=
 tells us it 
        first.  Sometimes we hear it wrong.  Someti=
mes we hear it 
        right. And so on.<br><br>It would be useful to know=
, as an individual, 
        how good we are at hearing it right, so we hav=
e some idea how 
        trustworthy our skill, or methods, or technology, =
is.  If we can 
        measure that, or even get a feel for it, we ca=
n look for ways to improve 
        it.  If we can't measure it, then =
we could be stuck.  
        <br><br>So, by restricting the answers on=
ly to the timeframe of the 
        experiment, we can help filter out some=
 of the problems of subjectivity: 
        for example, one theory is that =
people can hear what they want to hear, 
        or can these sounds in a c=
ertain way, once you already know the 
        answer.  Or, given 2 wa=
ys to hear a sound, being influenced, even 
        subconsciously, to hear=
 it one way over the other.  We want to rule 
        that out.<br><br=
>This is one reason we can only count on answers given 
        during the =
timeframe.  That is when the answer is most 
        objective.  =
Once the object has been announced, we move into 
        a  period wh=
ere we can't discount possible influence from already 
        knowing the =
answer.<br><br>But, I am confident that if a person's method 
        or te=
chnology really can reveal the correct answer outside the 
        timefram=
e, then doing it within the timeframe should be just as easy, 
        and =
would then be a valid objective result for all to see.<br><br>--- On

                                that you could download=
 the file at the 
                                beginning of the test, an=
d 'keep it safe' on 
                                your computer. Then at=
 the end of the test, I 
                                would release the =
password so you could reveal 
                                the contents =
of the file. That way, you were in

 of the original image during the entire

         them, are also in that RJ folder.<br><br>And if

               you did not care to download the zip file before
