<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Andy,

I have mostly worked with the white noise, when I insert any type 
noise.  Lately I&#x27;ve been going &quot;noiseless&quot; and just letting the audio 
snippets come through... but when I do use it, I like the white.

I guess because there is such a history with EVP and white noise.  
They are like a team from way back.  So many EVP pioneers used it.

Good idea you have with the DVD and looping track.  Any way you can 
insert the noise is helpful.
I haven&#x27;t used any brown or red... how is that working for you?

And thanks for the kind words...
- Mike

&gt; Mike, quick question...I have been experimenting with a multichannel
&gt; system inspired by your spiricomp system. Rather than adding the 
white
&gt; noise at the computer recording stage, I have a standalone dvd 
player
&gt; with a looping track. I have experimented with white and pink noise
&gt; tracks, but was just curious which you have had the most success 
with.
&gt; I also made a brown/red noise track, and wondered if you had
&gt; experimented with that at all. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance, you work has been very helpful in getting me
&gt; started down this road.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Andy

tour of 
&gt; &gt; the EVP and ITC systems I use, with a quick explanation of their 
setup.
