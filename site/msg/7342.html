Lorraine is a doll.  I love talking with her.  I interviewed her for one of my books.  She is very much a character.

    Because by contract PSR has to use the word demon on each episode (J/J). The name alone gets people interested, scared and so on. LOL Oh, I love Lorainne Warren's method of removing Chip from a trance. She slapped the shit out of him. he he hehe I almost fell over! You could hear the sarcastic "thank you" from Chip. LMFAO

    Yes, the old "demon chasing" crap, once again. 

I brought the following thought up elsewhere and will bring it up 
here for consideration, too. If ghosts are coming through the box 
and thus are not in a good state of mind, how come on Paranormal 
State CM was willing to believe the message given by the ghost via 
the box as being truth (The ghost via the box said a "demon" was 
holding the ghosts captive there)? 

I would suggest that perhaps a ghost (assuming we are talking about a 
disembodied person who remains earthbound) is not in a healthy state 
of mind one would consider "stable," but trapped in emotional trauma 
of some sort. Thus, how reliable could the message of a ghost then 
be? ;)
