Hello Frank,
I am new, my name is lee and both me and my son have heard you on the Art 
Bell show. My son is into electronics and will join soon but I have a 
question that you or your members might be able to answer.
There is a person in Nova Scocia whos 14 yr old daughter commited suicide 
by hanging in a tree. They keep getting that she is asking for Masses and 
prayers to be said for her. Why do they need many Masses said for them/ She is 
also always holding a Rose everytime she shows up.
Any thoughts on this subject? I dont know what to say to this lady.
 
Also, my son has built one of the radio shack boxes.
 
lee
