I don't think I h=
ave enough data yet to make  any conclusions, so I plan 
more experiments. =
 Since there  are different distinct claims about what the 
box or the  rec=
orders can do, I try to make different distinct experiments  
for each.

So=
me people claim they can get the box to  tell them things that the 
operato=
r couldn't know, so my "whats  the object" experiment is one way to examine=
 
that.  Some  people claim the boxes can make predictions, so cataloging  =

predictions and examining the results can help examine  that.  If there ar=
e 
other claims, I will try to figure  experiments based on those.
