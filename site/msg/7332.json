The only other investigative paranormal shows (in\n&gt; the states) still on the air are the TAPS related ones (TAPS and TAPS\n&gt; International) on SciFi. And I haven&#39;t seen them use a box yet.\n\nSome paranormal tv personalities have been talking it up on radio\ninterviews, though.  Both Patrick Burns of Haunting Evidence and Chris\nFleming of Dead Famous were really excited about it after getting to\nworking with some investigators who had various versions of ghost\nboxes recently.  I would be willing to bet that Chris will use them in\nwhatever his new series is.\n\n\nNellie"}
