I agree that 2012 probably the end of some earth cycle. However I do have m=
y doubts that it is the end of the world completely.

You know the date 201=
2 comes from the end of the Mayan calendar. They probably did align their c=
alendar with the natural cycles of the earth. I think they probably just le=
ft off at 2012 and didn't bother to extend it for the next cycle, whatever =
that would be.

That's my hunch anyway and that what I am going with it LOL=
!

  The reverse is often more dist=

   This is the stuff I=
've been getting since the first box "earth goes boom", and I think it's 20=
12. which is at least pretty much accepted by all that it's the end of come=
 current earth cycle.
