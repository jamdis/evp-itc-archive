Hence the key word here &quot;Vibration&quot;.  Given the audio we pick up via conventional EVP I believe they need our Vibrations to project their speech to imprint on to the recording.  That is why many times they will talk over you or are in the back ground during your conversations.  I believe you can capture this audio anywhere (NOT just in haunted locations).  Many of us choose to do our communication from our home, work, etc. and have no problem obtaining such audio.  So for those who believe you can only get EVP from a haunted location, I say Bologna!\n   \n  I believe (and remember this is only my theory) that is why anything that projects a constant sound, movement of pattern, (white noise, the radio scanning) you are allowing that opportunity to capture that audio.  \n   \n  As far as the box research end, when skeptics imply that its merely radio fragments, I have to disagree totally.  The believe that the scanning of these stations are allowing the projection of these voices to come through.  Many times if you notice the audio falls between the scanning (noted with the ticking of the 469).  Also on many occasions the pitch of the actual true EVP is very different to the voices heard on the radio.  Its as if hitching a ride to formulate the audio and/or words.  Frank and many others do not speak while conducting a session, BUT the noise that is being project from the devises used as well as the actually scanning compensates for our audio or works via the same way as our speech.\n   \n  Another scenario I will through into the mix is the fact that not all mammals have vocal cords, such as whales.  Whales make rhythmic, repeated patterns of sounds, or songs.The lowest sounds in their songs are audible over long distances. They direct a beam of click-like sounds and listen to the echoes that return from objects in the path of the sound. They are able to detect food and other animals this way as well. This  may be ways of sending sounds intended  as communication at short range through the water.  \n   \n  So is this any difference through space (or the air) vs the water?  Hell if I know, but just why could this be on the same premise?\n   \n  Just my thoughts!\n   \n  Juli\n  \n\n  \n\nlisbyfarrum &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n          You know what a doofus I am when it comes to electronics and basic\nradio understanding, but I experience exactly what you mention here,\nLC.
