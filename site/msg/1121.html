i've got the recipe and am redoing electrotherapeutic innovations of 25 years ago (one of which was the radiant energy device in "THE POWER" and it was also a communications device to several types of "beyond"--all the strange stuff is "of a piece" ). the non gas- discharge variant is running now. it has to run in the same place for 3 days before therapeutic energies appear.  i used it to regrow carl's hair once!  it's identical , in principle, to Moray electrotherapeutic device.
   
  up to date materials; custom , boutique ,fabrication shops; better performing semi-conductors-you could get burned as a witch for using gallium arsenide in FETs before 1980-  all the preceding make a BIG difference, as does the well deserved collapse of QM when applied to anything larger than a medium sized molecule.  professional pomposities will not rubber stamp something that "only" works; that totally kills private investment due to lawsuit paranoia.
   
  i'm going to presume it's ok to put this on EVP site
