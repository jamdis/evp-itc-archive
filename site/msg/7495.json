{"id": "7495", "subject": "Thanks Juli!", "author": "Robin Henson", "timestamp": "2008-03-01T02:51:20Z", "full_text": "I just wanted to offer a public thank you to Juli for inviting me \ninto the recording group she participates in.  I&#39;m excited to join in \nbut am experiencing some minor technical difficulties at the moment.\n\nACK!  I have no radio reception!  I&#39;m out in the boonies and my house \nbacks right up to a tree-covered hill.  I&#39;m going to have to find \nanother private place to do my research.\n\nI had to tag along on errands with hubby and son this afternoon and \nbrought my RS 470 and digital recorder with me for the ride.  You \nshoulda seen their reactions when I started asking the radio \nquestions in the car!  My son said I was scaring him (geez, he&#39;s 19), \nand my husband said I was like one of the bag ladies we see walking \ndown the street talking to herself.  They&#39;re both disappointed in me \nfor not having a more acceptable hobby like knitting.  I stayed in \nthe car recording when they went into the store, and then I noticed \nthere was this woman in the car next to me who had been staring at me \nopen-mouthed for God knows how long.  I haven&#39;t uploaded the \nrecording to the computer yet, but really don&#39;t think I got anything \nbesides radio fragment.\n\nSpeaking of that, the scan rate seems pretty fast, and yet the \nstations each hold for several seconds, so I get more like complete \nsentences than broadcast &quot;fragments.&quot; \n\nDo you think some people are chosen to be researchers in this field?  \nI guess I&#39;m feeling a little discouraged right now, but I&#39;ll figure \nthis out soon.     \n\nRobin"}
