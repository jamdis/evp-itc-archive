Re: [EVP-ITC] "it's all for nought" file (Tom=
's Tube folder)






 
I only use the E-mail to notify me when new message=
s are posted to the 
group site.  I do my group correspondence thru the sit=
e.  Our e-Mail is 
Lotus Notes and is a bit tricky and awkward to use (They=
 use lotus notes 
to avoid hackers), so working from the group page is much=
 more easier and 
relyable.
And also we get very little normal e-mail anywa=
y, so it wouldn't be an 
issue where I work. We are quite layed back here.

Thanks for the concern and heads up though.

TOM
