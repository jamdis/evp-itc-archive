&gt; Agreed, it is the best camera to get.  There are several models available:
&gt; some have built in IR lights, some have IR / UV lights, some are set-up for
&gt; sky watching, and others are just plain ol&#x27; full spectrum.
&gt; 
&gt; With this camera (depending on the model, a regular one with the different
&gt; options run around $120-150), you will also need the power supply ($12-$20),
&gt; a tripod, and a portable recorder.  My group uses 2 of them and each one is
&gt; attached to a portable DVD recorder that has a small LCD screen, you can
&gt; find these refurbished for under $100.

&gt; &gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I want to get a full spectrum camera. My hubby is going to get me one for
&gt; &gt; my Yule gift. I want a good one that captures apparitions. Does anyone here
&gt; &gt; use one with success? Or know which one is a good one?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Draiga
