&gt;  You are right-if you have to do too much enhancing to hear something,
&gt; then you just can&#x27;t call it EVP.
&gt;
&gt; But that really doesn&#x27;t mean that there isn&#x27;t anything there, because there
&gt; could be, but it isn&#x27;t good enough to be considered.
&gt;
&gt; You can tweak and play with a recording as long as you want, so long as you
&gt; always keep the original in pristine condition for comparison. When I go to
&gt; process my audio, upon opening the track, I immediately save it to another
&gt; name so that I am sure not to accidentally save over the original.
&gt;
&gt; If you have tweaked the audio to the point that it is completely
&gt; unrecognizable from the original, I would say that may be too far.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Are we just making ourselves believe there is something there??&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately I think alot of the times we are. It is called pareidolia, or
&gt; matrixing. It is a natural functioning of our brains to pick out familiar
&gt; patterns out of randomness. Like faces in the clouds and sounds in white
&gt; noise. This make our job of deciphering what is authentic EVP and what is
&gt; just matrixing very difficult. You can&#x27;t even trust yourself entirely.
&gt;
&gt; Now before Frank kicks my butt on that, I need to state the disclaimer that
&gt; this is only if we wish our evidence to stand up to scientific scrutiny. I
&gt; do know that there is some value to gut feelings, but gut feelings won&#x27;t get
&gt; you anywhere in the scientific world.

&gt;
&gt;  Now I may be biased to the &quot;investigation&quot; way of doing things.  I do
&gt; clean up evps if I hear something and can&#x27;t make it out do to ambient
&gt; noise.  So hear is my question.  When do you stop cleaning up?  Wouldn&#x27;t to
&gt; much enhancing &quot;taint&quot; the results?  To me the more enhancing you do the
&gt; less convincing it becomes.  I hope noone finds this offensive, it is not
&gt; meant to be I am just really curious.  The way I look at it is that if you
&gt; have to do so much enhancing to find anything, was there really something
&gt; there to begin with.  Are we just making ourselves believe there is
&gt; something there??
