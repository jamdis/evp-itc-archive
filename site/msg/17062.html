hing to this idea and theory.=C2=A0 So far I am not seeing a whole lot othe=

If this =

point.=C2=A0 I am gong to say it one more time, if this is a question of fa=

a mater of Faith, that is fine. But say so, and while you are at it, don't =

ot what we want them to be!

But, when you put it out there as a statement =
of fact, and then ride the asses of anyone that questions it, I got more th=
an a problem with it.

I have sat back and been a member here for a long ti=
me. Keep my mouth shut, but this is more than crossing the line.

If it is =
real, than lets look at it.=C2=A0 But when we look at it, lets look at what=
 we know to be the truth and lets take all of that data into consideration =
and discernment before coming to a conclusion.

That is not to much to ask!=
