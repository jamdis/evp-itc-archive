My hubby was a little reluctant to let me use it, but I&#39;m cute, what can I say? As far as the speed goes, I was turning it as fast as I could, but it was a little tight. I guess it needs some WD40. \n&gt; At :45 I hear &quot;Do you compute, McPhereson.&quot; and then a man answers &quot;Yes&quot; pretty clearly. I had told &quot;them&quot; that I was testing out this radio and that they should talk, so maybe they were testing it, too. Jamie\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Urkel23&quot; &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 13 seconds &quot;Get Frank Ready&quot;.  I didn&#39;t hear much else, a little too slow for me.  I prefer a faster sweep without any words from radio stations to come through.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; S-H\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jamietreetalker&quot; thequilldriver@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Did anyone see this?

This is a video I made on May 16,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2011 of me using my late father-in-law&#39;s old multiplex radio to get EVP\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using a manual sweep. Pretty cool stuff, if I do say so. Thanks to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank! I don&#39;t think I would have tried this without his influence.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT2wenvO69I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
