<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Sorry Bruce.  I was so excited, I got carried away.  When I&#x27;m excited,
I have a totally different thought pattern.  

I do understand what you are saying though about doing it one question
at a time.  I&#x27;ll be sure to do that from now on.  Thanks for the help.

Jeremy

&gt; Jeremy,
&gt;  
&gt; There are quite a few answer or messages just in this clip.
&gt; My suggestion is to go over the clip a question at a time.
&gt;  
&gt; Put the whole recording into your editer and go to the beginning
&gt; of a question and then save the question and the preceeding signal
up to the next question.
&gt; In a file of it&#x27;s own. Go over the recorded data following the
single question and look for specific answers.
&gt; to that question. If there are any save that answer to a new file in
the editer and slow it or clean it a bit so it is compehencible.
&gt; then paste it back where it belongs in the question file. You should
now have the question and answer in one file.
&gt; Save it and label it with the question and answer as one file.
&gt;  
&gt; I hope you understand that explination, if not fire back some
questions and I&#x27;ll try to clarify.
&gt;

&gt; After listening again, I think the &quot;tells me to&quot; part is more
thanlikely just a radio station.Jeremy--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com,
&quot;ecuyler&quot; &lt;ecuyler@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Just posted a new file on Esnips. It&#x27;s
fairly big in size so I went&gt; ahead and put it on there to help save
space on here. This is the
link:&gt;http://www.esnips.com/doc/99a4a4b1-de10-40d8-943e-85b809a2332a/Session-4-01_30_08-20-125-govt&gt;
&gt; I did as Bruce had asked and just used the RS 20-125 with a digital&gt;
recorder and this is what I came up with. It&#x27;s a little over 30&gt;
seconds long. &gt; &gt; Bruce, if you still want to hear all of this
session, I will put it&gt; all on Esnips. Just let me know. There is
quite a bit more to it&gt; than just this one clip. It&#x27;s amazing all the
things that came through.&gt; &gt; Here&#x27;s a little background on the file. I
asked two questions. The&gt; first was, &quot;Is the US governemnt using ITC
research?&quot; The second,&gt; &quot;How is the US goverment using ITC research?&quot;
I hear these things in&gt; this order: &quot;Yeah it is, just stop it, just
stop, you need help,&quot; and&gt; something toward the end that I can&#x27;t quite
make out. Sounds like a&gt; couple of words and then &quot;tells me to.&quot; Let
me know what you think.&gt; &gt; Jeremy&gt;
