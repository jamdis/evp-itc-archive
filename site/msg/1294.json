It&#39;s what others hear and clarity that differs with each method. Sometimes I will get the clearest sounds a few hear them perfect as I do...others hear something but they dont know what. Some people use headphones, I prefer stereo speakers rather than computer speakers. Pc to 5 band equalizer to dual x-bass speakers so when I say I blow my ears off I mean it.
