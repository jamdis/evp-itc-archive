I am looking for =

The subject of the research is:
Attempted spirit =

If selected, the volu=

the aircraft crash in question.=A0 This crash debris was obtained after all=
 litigation was complete and a salvage company had purchased all debris fro=
m the airline company.
Note: There are no health hazards associated with th=

g at this time in order to make it a controlled ITC experiment.=A0 This way=
 the audio files I receive from participants may or may not contain informa=
tion about those who perished or information about their life.=A0 I alone k=
now that information at this time.
It won't take much of your time.=A0 All =
I ask from the selected researchers are five, 30 second audio files of atte=
mpted spirit contact, using a method of the researcher's choice.=A0 The cra=
sh debris you will be provided must be used in association with the attempt=

You c=

If you are interested in volunteering, please send me a priva=

 keep it if you wish...
Thanks!
