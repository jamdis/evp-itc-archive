Just because the messages are coming from your subconscious does not mean y=
ou aren't interacting with actual, intelligent souls. Think of your subcons=
cious a link to the astral plane. The subconscious is just the scientific w=
ord for it. We are all part of the astral, the collective unconscious. This=
 is how people can read minds and how psychics get messages. They read the =
astral plane.

  Well, then who are all these peopl=
e???I sure don't know many of them, I recognize my mother's voice because s=
he lived just about her whole life with me, but I don't know very many peop=
le, they could be guides, but I only know one of two of them by name, and s=
o far they have not come through yet, as far as I know. No these got to be =
real people not some brain fart coming out of our heads, lol  I had a few c=

    I am starting to wonder if it isn't an audible scrying method.=
 I am sure you have all heard of "scrying" - a person gazes into a reflecti=
ve surface and gets visions. These visions messages are from the Self - mes=
sages from your subconscious.

    Maybe listening to random noise can be a=
n audible way of scrying.

      This is a perfect example of how an EVP can be very perso=
nal as to what you get out of it.
