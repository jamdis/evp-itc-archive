Just to \nmake sure I clipped both ends!! It seems to be working fine. The Am \nband sweeps must slower than the FM band. \n\nKay\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;reesclarke_69&quot; &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I was wondering if anybody ever post the hack for the  RS 12-820?  I \n&gt; think I was told that the hack was the same as the 12-470, but I not \n&gt; for sure.  I am buying that radio today, and I would like to hack it \n&gt; tonight.  I guess all you hacve to do is cut the mute pin.  Let me \n&gt; know if this is correct, and have a great day\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; William Rees Clarke\n&gt;"}
