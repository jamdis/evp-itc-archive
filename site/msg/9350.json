Maybe I missed something but in this email a few days ago from Bruce he talked about Air People messages and was looking for a response from others.  I kind of like that description of us.  We are Air People cause we breath air...and they...not.  Someone also mentioned Air Heads but I don&#39;t know who they were referring to.
