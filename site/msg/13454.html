Yes but we dont have to hide and sneak around like the good old days when p=
eople didnt even want to think about spirits and so forth. Now we need fanc=
y expensive equipment to be taken seriously. 35 mm was my camera of choice =
for many man years. cassette tape was as good as it got for audio thyen vhs=
 cameras came in but low light slowed things down with them till the advent=
 of fancy new fangled night vision and so forth the old infra red was as go=
od as it got 30-40 years ago. god I am getting old.LOL

It is truly ironic that pa=
rt of my professional background and training happens to be in broadcast pr=
oduction. So I am intimately aware of what it takes to produce and distribu=
te television programs and why and how this is done. I concur completely th=
at it is inaccurate to view these shows as "reality". They are of course "e=
ntertainment. " (Actually they have their own classification which came int=

What is troubling, perhaps only to me because=

the state of affairs in this and related fields. The more investment there =
the more this is obvious.
