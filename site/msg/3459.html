Bruce,
I just wanted to drop a line and say Amen!   Granted, the electro=
nic element is the 'e' in EVP (and the 'i' in ITC), but the most accomplish=
ed researchers (including Maggy and Jules, Konstantin and Friedrich, and ye=
s, Mark Macy, insist that if you have the harmony, love, and RESONANCE amon=
g researchers, all the electronic problems can be overcome.  
Is anyone inv=
olved in the AA-EVP 'Big Circle' group?  I see that they attempt contact al=
l at once from their own homes around the country, I think on Thursday even=
ings at a set time.
Is anyone interested in this?  From what I see, and fro=
m my own new interest, it seems most of us try contacts as much as possible=
 throughout the day.  Anyone want to try a set time?
