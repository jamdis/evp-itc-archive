<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Looking for something in the workroom and found this. Already had it
modified for manual operation, but don&#x27;t rmember when, or where it came
from. It has a built in amp(speaker driver), so for a baisc box just needs
sweep, and I added line out for a recorder. I might not have used it because
of the weird band switch, so I found a way to use it as is.
