&gt; Cool...not sure what that means exactly, lol.  ;)
&gt;  
&gt; Should we all do what FS does then? Is that better? 
&gt;  
&gt; Just asking. 
&gt;  
&gt; I&#x27;m not quite sure what taking a few moments to get clear and centered before a box session could hurt...or how swinging a pendulum for 30 seconds while adjusting my scans makes it &quot;overly serious&quot;, but what do I know? 
&gt;  
&gt; I didn&#x27;t invent the things.

&gt; Weird how I invented the stuff, and don&#x27;t take so serious.

&gt; I use both though I personally prefer using AM. 
&gt;  
&gt; A lot of it depends on the device being used, its range and reception, the resulting audio clarity and what &quot;they&quot; wish for me to use as well. 
&gt;  
&gt; Many times the ones I speak to and work with will give me specifics and ask me to adjust my sweep speeds, the specific scans and programs available to them or even just to switch from AM to FM and vice versa. 
&gt;  
&gt; To find the most optimal scanning rates and audio settings I prefer to use dowsing (with pendulums, L-Rods, an aurameter, etc), applied kinesiology and muscle testing. Before my box sessions and recordings I always spend some time (a few minutes, at least) in meditation...nothing too involved or outrageous...just enough to get clear, become centered, grounded, focused, open, receptive and properly attuned to subtle beings and energies. 
&gt;  
&gt; Once I&#x27;ve entered a state of relaxed focused awareness (very similar to meditation or self hypnosis) I&#x27;ll go ahead and connect with a higher energy field, my ancestors or the spirit world in general and begin the process of dowsing while posing my questions, mentally or aloud, to find the best possible combination of bands, scans, sweep rates, volume, distance and other factors which all contribute to great recordings and helpful, empowering, inspiring and positive exchanges with those in Spirit.

&gt; Im wondering what most people use for evp reception
&gt; Which do you work on most AM or FM for evp personally i prefer the fm band i find there is less radio interference and the voices seem to be clearer has anyone tried the short-wave frequencies
