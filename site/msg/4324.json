The water method. Recording water &quot;noise&quot; is how I got my first evp (i suppose) and has always been my base method, the one I return to. The fish tank in the room pumps water continuously thru the filter and makes a small waterfall effect. The first evp was my mothers voice, a happy/insane accident, the rest have been on purpose recordings.\n   \n  I try alot of different methods, so far all are capable of yielding results but for my ears some methods are capable of better human voice quality tones, and longer sentence clarity. There is no perfect method. I dont think there is meant to be a &quot;perfect&quot; method. If we knew everything there was to know, then what is there left to learn about hehehe\n   \n  Most have success with the water method, give it a try sometime. You can use the fishtank (if you have one) pump/filter from the other side of a room as background noise, or you can record while the shower runs, or the sink runs. Dont record too close to the bg sound source. In this room I am about 14 feet away from the tank and I set my mics volume to 1/2 sound volume (thats 5 in audacity). Laura K. recorded her pool and a fountain in her house and had some good results. Frank R. also had success using this method. Charli&#39;s coffeepot had a similar effect. It pumped the water thru a charcoal filter and they could hear voices emitting thru the noise.\n   \n  It&#39;s interesting to me that some of the same voices carry over no matter what method. Harsh noise, soft noise, no noise.... they still talk. Whether everyone hears them or not LOL\n   \n  Test it out =) The p1 filter for clearvoice was made for h2o, it does raise the level of thier voices and clear up some of the static noise for me so I dont get a headache listening. Use whatever works best for you.\n   \n  Misty\n   \n   \n  psi_research &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n          Misty, I may have missed an earlier post, what&#39;s an H20 voice? -Bill\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hiya Frank\n&gt; \n&gt; I can hear that.
