&gt; Hello everyone, I thought I would introduce myself, my name is Lee
&gt; and I own and host Pulse Talk Radio this is a show that is partly
&gt; entertainment and partly informative.
&gt;
&gt; Just lately we have been covering &quot;the Box&quot; mainly Joes box but
&gt; always with reference to Franks, I have always been fascinated by
&gt; EVP and progressive paranormal research equipment so I caught on to
&gt; this subject rather quickly and it now has captured my imagination.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m not electronically minded but know what a capacitor and Micro
&gt; chip look like and I&#x27;m very good with theory&#x27;s and hope I can help
&gt; with input into this amazing piece of equipment/subject, you may ask
&gt; why should he be amazed by something he has only heard of and does
&gt; not own, well I have been on a live box session over Skype and this
&gt; box clearly said Hello Lee in response to a direct question, now to
&gt; a open minded sceptic like myself this was a revelation and now I&#x27;m
&gt; hooked on the whole concept, not to say I&#x27;m a believer but very much
&gt; in to researching the idea further
&gt;
&gt; I would also like to say great job on Frank&#x27;s part for inventing the
&gt; box, when you get to know me you will see what a mile stone it is to
&gt; get me to sit up and take note such is my scepticism on the whole
&gt; paranormal subject. I respect those that strive to make new
&gt; equipment for us the paranormal investigation world, keep up the
&gt; good work I will be watching closely for up dates and try and pitch
&gt; my ten cents in when I thinks it&#x27;s warranted
&gt;
