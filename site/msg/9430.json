Bummer that happened.  :0(  Most of us computer users know the golden rule \n(besides BACKUP) is to save your session immediately so that if anything strange happens, \nit will have been stored on the hard drive.  LOL - I should talk! -  I&#39;ve lost more than a few \nsessions by ignoring this sage advice in the past, but nothing so spectacular as you \ndescribe.  I record into my laptop too, with Audacity.  \n\nI hope you have success tonight, and if you do, take two seconds to &#39;save&#39; your file the \nmoment the session ends.  Keep us posted!\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m guessing nobody believes me! O well I would like to tell you that it really is true, and \nI know in my heart, because I was there.  Not sure why them cpu went off, but maybe I \nhad too much infomation then they wanted me too.( I record write on to my laptop, and I \ndon&#39;t use any type of digital or analog recorder).  I will prove it again.  Tonight I am going \nto do everything the same to see if I can get it to happen again.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Rees\n&gt; \n&gt; reesclarke_69 &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           Hey guys\n&gt; \n&gt; I had the most amazing session last night. Me and my fiance \n&gt; did a session, and this is how it went. \n&gt; \n&gt; We usally do 10 min. of audio, and during the session we first \n&gt; contacted a guy named Virgil, and we got him to say both of our \n&gt; names. He said &quot;William&quot; for me, and &quot;Leigh&quot; for Ashley. We all \n&gt; communicated for the 10 min. He didn&#39;t answer every question, but \n&gt; he answered 75% of all answerslast night. We told him that we \n&gt; wanted to prove that they exsisted on the other side. Life after \n&gt; death. He answer &quot;we are over here&quot;, very plainly. After the 10 \n&gt; min. We ask for confirmation so we could shut off the radio, and we \n&gt; got this answer &quot;that would be a bad idea&quot;. Which freaked Ashley \n&gt; out. So we kept the radio on and we had a conversation with this \n&gt; preacher, then while the band was still sweeping the preacher came \n&gt; through and he talked to us (while sweeping the band), and started \n&gt; to preach to us about our side, and how messed up it is.(the band \n&gt; was sweeping the whole time, I never stop the band from sweeping) \n&gt; He said that we needed to pray for our enemies as well as our \n&gt; friends and families. He talked to us for 6 to eight minutes. \n&gt; Then we finished the session (Ask for confirmation)when he didn&#39;t \n&gt; come through any more. We shut down. Then of course I get up and \n&gt; put everything back the way it is supposed to be. Leaving the \n&gt; session that we just did on the laptop. Then I went to take a \n&gt; shower, and I come back. The laptop was turned off and I lost all \n&gt; of the session. Sometimes the computer will log itself off, then \n&gt; when you get back it is exactly the was it was when you left it. \n&gt; But this wasn&#39;t the case, some reason the laptop shut itself off, \n&gt; and we lost all of the evidence that we had. Didn&#39;t have nothing, \n&gt; and I couldn&#39;t believe that we lost everything. So thats why I am \n&gt; sitting here typing away about what happen last night. Instead of \n&gt; me posting files about what happen last night. I wish so bad that \n&gt; y&#39;all would have been able to hear the communication. It was a life \n&gt; changing experience. It made me think a whole lot different about \n&gt; box research. I still can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t save it before the \n&gt; computer turned itself off. That is what happen to me last night, \n&gt; and change box research for me for the rest of my life.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; William Rees Clarke III\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                            \n&gt; \n&gt;  __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
