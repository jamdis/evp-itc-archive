<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That explains a lot. I&#x27;m of the opinion that to truly &quot;judge&quot; this  
research fairly, you have to actively record.
The experience is what helps determine what is what and even listening  
to evp/itc is a learned talent and takes practice. Especially with  
harder to hear samples. Spirit voices aren&#x27;t always human, and thus,  
don&#x27;t alway sound like humans.

You just answered many questions and made things very clear - thank you.

Perhaps some day you&#x27;ll join us in recording so you&#x27;ll understand what  
we&#x27;re talking about. Some things must be
experienced to be understood. I can describe to you riding a wild  
horse, but unless you&#x27;ve done it, you&#x27;ll remain clueless to my  
experience. You&#x27;d probably understand a lot more if you simply make  
the effort to record.

Believe you me, if you sit quietly with nothing but a digital recorder  
and you record a voice out of nowhere that clearly says your name and  
more, I doubt you&#x27;ll have to worry about matrixing or stray radio  
signals.

&gt; Not as of yet...there is a lot more research that needs to be done

&gt; One friend believes that when you record EVP&#x27;s you are opening  
&gt; yourself to such things as what we have been discussing here. I am  
&gt; not certain that he is right. I am not certain that he is wrong,  
&gt; either. :)
&gt;
&gt; I think though that if we did get into EVP&#x27;s, then we would do a lot  
&gt; of experimentation using foreign language radio stations. Since we  
&gt; live fairly close to Canada, we can occasionally pick up a French  
&gt; broadcast. I think that it would be beneficial to record using a  
&gt; foreign language broadcast. Least that would partially eliminate the  
&gt; problem with matrixing.
&gt;
&gt; You see, w, there are a lot of questions that keep popping up in my  
&gt; head. Such as, if the spirit (entity) uses the words of a radio  
&gt; broadcast, why do you need to use an antenna? This is just one  
&gt; question, I am sure that there are tons more.
