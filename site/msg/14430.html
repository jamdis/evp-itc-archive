<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I use Adobe Audition...99 per cent of the time the procedure I use to
&quot;clean up&quot; evp&#x27;s is this...I amplify...then I will use the graphic
equalizer preset on vocal presence....occasionally I use the slow down...

This works really well for me....I&#x27;m just saying,

&gt; The problem with it Jim is that there is no way to &quot;clean&quot; the audio
&gt; without effecting the stuff you want to keep as well. At least not with
&gt; the cheapy softwares. I head the Adobe Audition is much better at it, but
&gt; still not perfect.
&gt;
&gt; But again, enhance all you want, just make sure you keep the original
&gt; unaltered.

&gt;   Well, for myself...I don&#x27;t &quot;clean&quot; them up to much because I really
&gt; don&#x27;t know HOW :) (well a little bit)Since I&#x27;ve only been at it for a
&gt; couple weeks. BUT if you can clean up something to where you can FIND
&gt; what was there to begin with &quot;you have done no harm&quot; I hear alot more
&gt; than others I guess, and I haven&#x27;t enhanced many of my evp&#x27;s.*If anyone
&gt; is able to clean them up...I DO promise you will hear what I say is
&gt; correct)Pretty BOLD statement, but if you are able to clean it up with
&gt; better software (please do for others too) I will be more than happy to
&gt; &quot;listen&quot; where I made a mistake...I can only LEARN from it :) I have
&gt; done some DEEP enhancements to a few of my evp&#x27;s...from the begining I
&gt; could only hear clicks and thumps.....but after messing with that area,
&gt; eventually I would hear the true voices (and can tell if male or
&gt; female...approximate age) and understand the mood also....these where
&gt; extreamly modified, and I feel that I could NOT have added enough
&gt; &quot;simple&quot; enhancements that would ADD a voice....full of emotion and
&gt; distinct syllables :) And some just can&#x27;t hear them for what ever reason
&gt; be it equipment that is used to hear (pc-headphones-speakers-ears) know
&gt; one has the perfect match of all these things. Check out &quot;Jim&#x27;s RR-DR60
&gt; EVP&#x27;s&quot; in the files section....work them over till you hear them. I
&gt; really can&#x27;t do much more :)--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Eric

&gt;   &gt; Now I may be biased to the &quot;investigation&quot; way of doing things. I do
&gt; clean
&gt;   &gt; up evps if I hear something and can&#x27;t make it out do to ambient noise.
&gt; So
&gt;   &gt; hear is my question. When do you stop cleaning up? Wouldn&#x27;t to much
&gt;   &gt; enhancing &quot;taint&quot; the results? To me the more enhancing you do the
&gt; less
&gt;   &gt; convincing it becomes. I hope noone finds this offensive, it is not
&gt; meant
&gt;   &gt; to be I am just really curious. The way I look at it is that if you
&gt; have to
&gt;   &gt; do so much enhancing to find anything, was there really something
&gt; there to
&gt;   &gt; begin with. Are we just making ourselves believe there is something
&gt; there??
