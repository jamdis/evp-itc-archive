I want to get started with this stuff, and figured the best place would be EVP.  I got an IC recorder and am ready to go.  I have a few questions though.\n\nAt my friend&#39;s house there is *something* that likes to make noises when it knows you can hear it.  It&#39;ll make big loud footsteps and generally try to scare the crap out of you.  It would seem like a good place to start buuuuut I don&#39;t know if attempting to communicate with it will make things worse.  Good idea?  Bad idea?  Does it matter?\n\nI really wanted to tryout that allophone + EVPMaker combo that seems to be generating some good results.  EVP voices are so faint it&#39;s incredibly hard for me to make them out at this point.\n\nLastly, how do you deal with family and relatives that disapprove of this stuff?  I live alone (well, with a roommate) and they seem to think I&#39;m getting into some sort of voodoo or sorcery or something.  They seem to think that the voices are all demons or something.  I don&#39;t know how to explain it to them, I wish I could get them to understand.  I am generally a curious person so it was only a matter of time before I actually started with this stuff.\n\nThanks for reading!  :)"}
