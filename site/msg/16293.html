<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>From what I&#x27;ve heard, it&#x27;s not that the end of the world is coming, it&#x27;s that a new age is coming; something is going to happen, a big change, but no one knows precisely what.  So it could be something similar to 911, where everyone sees things differently after that point, but not necessarily a big explosion like that; it could be a change in human collective consciousness.  This is the sort of thing the Mayan scholars are saying will happen. 

But I agree:  something is going to happen, even if it&#x27;s subtle.

&gt; Ya have to keep in mind, it&#x27;s not just a Mayan thing, this date is all over
&gt; the world, in almost every culture. Besides I think there&#x27;s going to be alot
&gt; of debunking going, so anything the &quot;experts&quot; put out there would be suspect
&gt; at best.
&gt; 
&gt;  the date is based on the sun crossing the galatic center, and that happens
&gt; in 2012. The original Mayan calendar builders, not the people there now,
&gt; were not stupid, they could do all these calculations presumably without
&gt; computers, show me one of these brainiac astronomers today that can do that.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  We&#x27;re gonna get more and more of these experts proclaiming how it&#x27;s all
&gt; non-sense.

&gt; &gt;   Several years ago on the Discovery Channel they said that the Mayan
&gt; &gt; calendar was baised on the orbit of Venus, if this is true 2012 has come and
&gt; &gt; gone. I am not saying that nothing wont happen, but remember  the Y2K and
&gt; &gt; Planet X
&gt; &gt; hoax?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi All;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  I tried to listen to the C2C show last night on 2012, but OMG, these
&gt; &gt; supposed experts they get! First, Strieber has no concept of how the Mayans
&gt; &gt; could possibly have known anything, since we are supposed to be so much more
&gt; &gt; advanced, and he thinks he is such a genius, but can&#x27;t figure it out. The
&gt; &gt; guy is frikkin&#x27; idiot! The other &quot;expert&quot;, Bob Gleason, better, but still,
&gt; &gt; basing everything on current knowledge. So the &quot;information&quot; on 2012 comes
&gt; &gt; down to some crackhead&#x27;s opinion, based on ego and nothing more.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  No wonder the stuff from the boxes is completely ignored by these people,
&gt; &gt; they have no concept of spirit, or any other entities, and all information
&gt; &gt; has to come from the likes of Strieber, Hoagland, and Howe. God almighty! I
&gt; &gt; am totally disgusted. Noory is supposedly co-authoring a book on spirit
&gt; &gt; communcation--yeah can&#x27;t wait for that--the new house has a fireplace!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  I know, I&#x27;m ranting, but instead of providing a place to share information
&gt; &gt; and insights, they make C2C a place to manipulate any facts that may exist,
&gt; &gt; and subtly debunk almost everything. I think it&#x27;s just another corporate
&gt; &gt; mouthpiece. They don&#x27;t want to the  masses seeking out the hidden bunkers
&gt; &gt; supposedly being perpared by the elite few--just a gues as to the why of
&gt; &gt; disinformation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  It would be easy to disregard one culture coming up with the date in 2012,
&gt; &gt; but the whole damn world!? I think it might be wise to pay attention. That
&gt; &gt; fact is conveniently ignored by these Mayan experts presenting their gospel
&gt; &gt; opinions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  This normally would not be EVP related, except I get that wormworm/comet
&gt; &gt; junk from the boxes almost every session.  The last three short recordings,
&gt; &gt; &quot;wormwood comes,-- wormwood, --wormwood... That&#x27;s the big comet from the
&gt; &gt; bible.
