I saw there was room for improvement with the ghost box movement we are aware of. Being a musician, i have a room all set up with most of the components of the spiricom system already. What i did was study the block diagram and instead of adding an AM receiver, i added the Sangean AM receiver to sweep instead of using an off station. For the tones, i used my laptop using evp assistant mic&#39;d through my PA system. I also incorporated tape deck noise for tone and an RF transmitter that i had to make my guitar wireless originally and on the receiver end of the transmitter i used the AM sweep. I posted 2 youtube videos, the first one was a little dark but the communication was good to listen to. Let me know what you think of this.\n\nHere are the links to the videos:\n\nPart 1:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKVz2iQxLqU\n\nPart 2:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU5ekSpSusc\n\n-Steve H."}
