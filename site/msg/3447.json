It helps to work with others sometimes others will get messages to pass on. If your sis is willing perhaps she could record with you too sometimes. Theres a variety of methods you can do there at home. With crossing sometimes theres a time barrier on this side, for us it seems to be either right away when they connect or long after. I am not sure why that is. I only know that for them time has no meaning. Often they say things months or years ahead of &quot;time&quot; or I just dont get it until much later down the road. \n\n    \n\n    They are welcome to speak in my sessions if they wish to and I am sure others here feel the same. So they will have many moments in &quot;time&quot; to choose from to come thru. If I hear those names I&#39;ll be sure and forward it on. Many names pass thru here. I dont know them but I try to post some of them just in case its for others. Im unable to post all of my files because I have very little free time. \n\n    \n\n    Let me just say that as a mom with kids, you only need a good half hour to record a couple minutes (set limits...no more than 3 minutes, but 30 seconds will do fine usually) then spend the rest of the half hour analyzing your files. Try to record often and that helps you strengthen the connection on your end as well as thiers. Once the connection is made, you may find that others give you answers to questions you have about them even if they are not ready to speak to us themselves. So maybe once the kids are in bed, and all is quiet in the house, you will find 30 minutes to research. If one method isnt working for you try one of the others you may get better results to get you started down the path.\n\n    \n\n    Misty\n\nKristin Morris &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; wrote:\n\n            Misty � this gives me hope.  I am so new to this and not technical in the least.  I wish I had 24 hours a day to dedicate to ITC but I have small children and they seem to take all my time.  I am hoping to find a few hours to modify that RS and really begin my attempts.  I am very grateful that this low tech idea was passed onto to us!  Just 3 weeks ago I too lost my niece (17yrs) and nephew (14yrs) to a car accident.  Aly, my niece died on impact, but her brother Ryan hung on for 4 more days and I was there with my sister (his mom) and his dad when they ended life support.  I don�t know if it is too soon.. but what a wonderful gift I could give my sister if I could capture their voices and let her know that her two children are still with us.\n\n    k\n\n      \n---------------------------------\n  \n    From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Misty Dawn\nSent: Wednesday, November 28, 2007 1:36 AM\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n\n\n            Glad she made it thru but sorry it had to be this way. I understand how that feels. Yes on the training part too, I have gotten that quite often over the years when new spirits begin to speak sometimes the others help them or even speak for them if they arent getting across clearly.

Sometimes I think different methods invite new contacts/entities. However many of the contacts remain the same and will use any method I choose. \n\n\n      Losing so many people on this side only strengthens the bonds to that side more. Of that I have no doubt. It&#39;s the ties that bind. Very true statement. For those who havent experienced loss its a bit of a different experience overall.

It just hits such a high note that it resonates thru your spirit sometimes.

I&#39;ve been trying to contact \nmy ex-girlfriend that passed last year at 29. That does sound like \nher voice, she has been coming through since Sunday night and i \nactually heard them through the radio telling her to talk and she \nsaid &quot;Hi Steve&quot;. They were like training her to use the radio, \npretty weird stuff but it was good to hear from her in her own \nvoice. The response time is remarkable with these radios, they seem \nto answer right away very &quot;frank&#39;s box&quot;-like. These will keep me \noccupied while i wait for #27---the #13 replacement. I&#39;m really \nexcited about that one, it may be the one to live up to for all \nfuture boxes. I&#39;m sure Frank could buy a radio shack box and add a \nsound chamber, that would probably really enhance the voices. These \nother boxes and radios are great, but there&#39;s only one Frank&#39;s Box \nfor all others to try to live up to. I don&#39;t think a 10 Minute mod \non a $25 dollar radio will ever replace the time and effort frank \nputs into his boxes. But anybody can try these radios and that&#39;s \nwhat is important, but without Frank there would have been no \nadvancement in ITC.

One by one they all crossed over, and one by one they have kept thier promises. &lt;O&gt;&lt;/O&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;O&gt;&lt;/O&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;  &lt;div class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; size=3&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;O&gt;&lt;/O&gt;So, that being said&lt;O&gt;&lt;/O&gt;&lt;O&gt;&lt;/O&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;  &lt;div class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; size=3&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&quot;If I die\n before you die I&#39;m coming back to haunt you all&quot;&lt;O&gt;&lt;/O&gt;&lt;O&gt;&lt;/O&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;  &lt;div class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; size=3&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;O&gt;&lt;/O&gt;&lt;IMG id=_x0000_i1025 height=18 src=&quot;http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/03.gif&quot; width=18&gt;&lt;O&gt;&lt;/O&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;O&gt;&lt;/O&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;  &lt;div class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; size=3&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;Misty&lt;O&gt;&lt;/O&gt;&lt;O&gt;&lt;/O&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;  &lt;div class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; size=3&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;O&gt;&lt;/O&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;Steve Hultay &lt;urkel23@aol.&lt;WBR&gt;com&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;O&gt;&lt;/O&gt;&lt;O&gt;&lt;/O&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 1.5pt solid&quot;&gt;  &lt;DIV id=ygrp-text&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;  &lt;div class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;FONT face=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; size=3&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;Yeah, since i start\n using the Radio Shack radios i have been getting &lt;BR&gt;full sentence conversations with them. I&#39;ve been trying to contact &lt;BR&gt;my ex-girlfriend that passed last year at 29. That does sound like &lt;BR&gt;her voice, she has been coming through since Sunday night and i &lt;BR&gt;actually heard them through the radio telling her to talk and she &lt;BR&gt;said &quot;Hi Steve&quot;. They were like training her to use the radio, &lt;BR&gt;pretty weird stuff but it was good to hear from her in her own &lt;BR&gt;voice. The response time is remarkable with these radios, they seem &lt;BR&gt;to answer right away very &quot;frank&#39;s box&quot;-like. These will keep me &lt;BR&gt;occupied while i wait for #27---the #13 replacement. I&#39;m really &lt;BR&gt;excited about that one, it may be the one to live up to for all &lt;BR&gt;future boxes. I&#39;m sure Frank could buy a radio shack box and add a &lt;BR&gt;sound chamber, that would probably really enhance the voices. These &lt;BR&gt;other boxes and radios are great, but there&#39;s only one Frank&#39;s Box &lt;BR&gt;for all others to try to live\n up to. I don&#39;t think a 10 Minute mod &lt;BR&gt;on a $25 dollar radio will ever replace the time and effort frank &lt;BR&gt;puts into his boxes. But anybody can try these radios and that&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;what is important, but without Frank there would have been no &lt;BR&gt;advancement in ITC. Someone had to break the ground work.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-Steve H.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@..&lt;WBR&gt;.&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Steve this one is shockingly responsive.
