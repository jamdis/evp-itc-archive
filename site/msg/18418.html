As I've said, we're just trying some things, and seeing what works and what=
 doesn't.=C2=A0 I don't understand why people run their own experiments sep=
arate from yours upsets you so.

You said below "I think much of the parano=
rmal depends on expectations, and if one 
expects to test this stuff with n=
o results, that's what they get."=C2=A0 So then, if participants expect to =
get the right answers, by your comment, it should work.


You said: "these =
pompus 
skeptics that accept no evidence".=C2=A0 It seems like you've start=
ed calling me names again, but I am accepting all the evidence these experi=
ments, show, whether positive or negative. You are not accepting the eviden=
ce the experiments are showing.

If you have other experiments, or changes =
to the current conditions, I am happy to try to accommodate them.=C2=A0 But=
 just calling people names from the sidelines doesn't really add anything t=
o the research, doesn't really advance any of your points, and certainly do=
esn't reflect well on your claims
