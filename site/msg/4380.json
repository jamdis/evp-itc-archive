I did post a bunch of EVPs \nunder &quot;Laptop EVPs&quot; in the files.  What I didn&#39;t make clear is that I&#39;d \nreally appreciate some comments/critiques/suggestions on what I&#39;ve \ndone.  I&#39;ve gotten a lot of stuff and would really like to run it by \nsomeone else.  I asked my wife, and she got a blank look, blinked \ntwice, turned and walked away.  My teenage son listened to one clip \ntwice, heard what I did, then had more important stuff to do.  So, it \nwould be nice to get some feedback on what I&#39;ve done so far.\n   I&#39;ve read that &quot;lower entities&quot; come across more on EVPmaker, but so \nfar I haven&#39;t had any rude experiences  yet.  Two days ago I forgot to \nstart the sessions with protection prayer/rules of engagement, and \nright away a Scottish voice said, &quot;Aye, it smells in here.&quot;  I&#39;ve got \nanother folder worth of stuff to upload, but want to get some comments \nabout my previous files first..\n I&#39;ve noticed two Bills here already, so to avoid confusion, I&#39;ll go by \nWilly.\nThanks\nWilly"}
