Hello, all.

My name is Michelle. I'm a certified medium w=
ith a Spiritualist church. This was a two year process which involved provi=
ng I can communicate with spirits to a congregation (not bragging - just tr=
ying to explain my background and why I know what I do). I'm also one of th=
e biggest skeptics you'll ever meet (It was one of two reasons I became a m=
edium. I wanted to see how they were "faking" it. Surprise! They weren't). =
I'd like to contribute what I've learned about spirits. As Jill wrote, "I(t=
) really takes personal experience to believe this stuff exists".


As to h=
er main question of "Why do spirits lie", I don't think we can always assum=
e they're lying. If the information comes through a medium, one of the firs=
t items to address is whether or not the medium received the message correc=
tly and then whether or not he/she interepreted it correctly and phrased it=
 in a way that allowed the recipient to understand the spirit's meaning. Th=
ere are a variety of ways spirits communicate with mediums; some are easier=
 than others to understand and pass on. For the harder methods, it would be=
 possible for a medium to inadvertently misinterept the message based on hi=
s/her past experiences. 


When we look at the question from the connection=
 to EVP's and ghost boxes, we have to examine a few items. Was the spirit a=
ble to use the devices correctly to form the words he/she actually intended=
? This is a two step process. It can be difficult for them to not only pull=
 the available energy into a useable form, but to also form the correct wor=
ds (think it as a foreigner learning English and saying "car" when they mea=
n "star". They sound similar, but have very different meanings). 


Did we =
understand the words they said? It's fairly easy to get them wrong, especia=
lly in instances where you aren't the first person to listen to the recordi=
ng and someone else says, "Here listen to this. I think they're saying (fil=
l in the blank)". Our brains are going to tell us (fill in the blank) simpl=
y because that thought is now prevalent. If we're the only person listening=
 to the recordings, the same mistake can be made. The only conclusive way i=
s to use equipment that can amplify and break down the recordings to make t=
hem clear enough to be agreed upon by a number of people who don't know wha=
t conclusions the other listeners have drawn. 


The idea of a spirit disto=
rting the facts must also be considered. Not lying, per se, but rather gett=
ing the facts within their reality confused. This is where you have the rig=
ht to have the facts validated by the spirit. Ask them to prove it to you. =
They can tell you some corresponding items that back up their claims, direc=
t you to old newspaper stories or to a person they used to affiliate with o=
r bring the validation into your focus (meaning the same thing comes into y=
our life while you're driving/working/ at home/talking to someone/reading a=
nd etc.) at least three times. A spirit who is being truthful will not mind=
 trying to make this happen. 


Once these have been considered and elimina=
ted, then we should be willing to entertain the idea the spirit may be a lo=
wer energy being (a bully/swindler/ con-man or woman/narcissist and etc) in=
 their past life and this is the only way they know how to achieve what the=
y want. And yes, those spirits do exist. "As in life, so in death", meaning=
 our personalities don't change when our bodies die.


Al, maybe he wasn't =
trying to prove anything. Is it possible the spirit voice didn't mean he WA=
S (typed larger for emphasis) Steve Tate, but rather wanted to talk ABOUT S=
teve Tate or get a message TO Steve Tate? Did he mean to say "Still fate"? =
Could he have meant "paratrooper" ? See where I'm going with this? 


And f=
inally, in regards to the "end of the world stuff", it has been taught to m=
e by mediums and teachers who were all very honest and excellent at what th=
ey do, and it has been relayed to me by spirits I've encountered in my medi=
umship service that we don't have a free glimpse of the future once our bod=
ies die and we move into spirit form. I mean no offense and I'm not impying=
 that wasn't what was heard. That said (or rather 'typed'), I'd be VERY hes=
itant to believe this communication. There are beings that are privvy to th=
e potential (underscore "potential") future in our lives, but it isn't thei=
r nature to join us for EVP sessions. 


I hope I haven't taken liberty wit=
h this forum by posting such a long reply. I thank you for your time and at=
tention. If you have other questions or would like me to clarify something,=
 please ask. I'd be honored to share what I know and track down what I don'=
t. :)
