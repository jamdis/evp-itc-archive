&gt; &gt; Hello guys, &amp; gals
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I hope everybody is having a great day, its a beatiful day in the 
&gt; &gt; Bluegrass State of Kentucky. I just had a death in my Family, and 
&gt; I 
&gt; &gt; was wandering if anybody does a session today/or tonight if you 
&gt; could 
&gt; &gt; try to get in contact with a Mr. Charlie Clarke,(my Great Uncle) 
&gt; or 
&gt; &gt; Mrs. Joann Clarke(his wife has past a couple of months ago)to see 
&gt; if 
&gt; &gt; you can contact them. If you do contact him can you tell him that 
&gt; &gt; Rees will be asking to speak with them tonight around 7-8pm 
&gt; eastern 
&gt; &gt; time. To see if they can contact me. They lived a long and 
&gt; &gt; wonderful life together. So all my family is sad to see him go, 
&gt; but 
&gt; &gt; we know it was his time to leave, and life goes on. He should be 
&gt; &gt; happy to be back with his wife. (He was 83 years old) I know 
&gt; &gt; probaly somebody here might think this is crazy, dumb or 
&gt; &gt; disrespectful, but that is my business. I think it should be easy 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; get in contact with him since he just crossed over. Please let me 
&gt; &gt; know if you tried and any evidence you might get from him.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; William Rees
