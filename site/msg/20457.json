I don&#39;t know how you are getting around in all that. I think most of the US is having a tougher winter than normal. Down here they closed many businesses and all the schools because it &quot;might&quot; snow a few weeks ago. I&#39;m originally from NYC, so that kind of thing really blows my mind.\n\nWhere I am now only gets snow once every 5 years or so, but this year was the second year in a row that we got some. It usually doesn&#39;t get below freezing at night until February, but this year it started in December. \n\nI&#39;ll keep my eyes open for your email.\n\n~Draiga\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Urkel23&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Cold?  I&#39;ll trade you any day for this aweful NJ weather.  We are getting pummeled, one storm after another.\n&gt; \n&gt; Always at least a foot of snow on the ground accompanied with ice.  The temps never get out of the teens and 20&#39;s either.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aaaaarrrgh !!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; As for the box, sweeps change but the idea stays the same.  Meet the new box, same as the old box.
