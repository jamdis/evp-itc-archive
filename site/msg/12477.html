&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; You&#x27;re right... so I&#x27;ve added your accomplishments as a note under 
&gt; that blog history entry you saw. Right under the 24 Nov 2007 date 
&gt; event.
&gt; 
&gt; http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/2008/10/move-over-franks-box-radio-
&gt; shack-hack.html
&gt; 
&gt; By-the-way:
&gt; I&#x27;ve got the new version of the 12-470 (black case) torn apart on 
my 
&gt; bench again.  I know I failed to get it hacked the first time (last 
&gt; year), but I figured I&#x27;d try it again.  It is totally different 
than 
&gt; the others... and they have made sure you can&#x27;t tell what the radio 
&gt; chip is by getting rid of the markings and covering both sides of 
the 
&gt; circuit board with a waxy substance. I&#x27;ve been carefully scraping 
it 
&gt; away. The chip is a 30 pin device, possibly a KK22425 or KK22426 or 
&gt; equivilent.
&gt; The mute pin for the #25 is pin 2 but looking at the connection 
&gt; scheme itmight not be the right one.
&gt; I guess I&#x27;ll mess with it until I break it... or ???
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ll put some pictures of the new 12-470 circuit board in my photo 
&gt; area of this froum.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Mike,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You forgot to mention that i was the first to do the hack after 
&gt; Bill 
&gt; &gt; and post files that same day.  I also stumbled across 3 other RS 
&gt; &gt; radios that i hacked (12-820, 20-125, 12-150) to share with other 
&gt; &gt; researchers.  A mention would have been nice in your blog, but 
you 
&gt; &gt; contribute a lot of time too and we all appreciate it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; -Steve H.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Last night on Haunted Times Magazine radio , guest Brian 
Harnois 
&gt; &gt; (Ghost
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hunters International) told the radio listening audience that 
he 
&gt; &gt; didn&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; &gt; think anyone should use a Franks&#x27; Box, (or a ghost box is what 
he 
&gt; &gt; was
&gt; &gt; &gt; insinuating) unless they had training from Christopher Moon.
&gt; &gt; &gt; So... that is the topic of my blog write-up this morning if you 
&gt; &gt; care to
&gt; &gt; &gt; read it.
