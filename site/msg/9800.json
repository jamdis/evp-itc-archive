If I do something like straighten or right a fallen \ntombstone, I&#39;ve noticed the threatened feeling to disappear.\n\nIt&#39;s as if that simple action convinced someone that you are OK.\n\nZack\n\nOn Tue, 15 Apr 2008, April Slaughter wrote:\n\n&gt; While I think it is always a good idea to keep a positive energy about\n&gt; oneself, I honestly do not believe the box (in its many forms) is\n&gt; anymore dangerous than other tools used in paranormal research.
