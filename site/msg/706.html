well , dont feel like your out of your league! I think that most of us are LOL in the sense that we dont have perfect ideas and know why or how things work and it makes you design new things like frank or makes you come up with new filters like misty. So its not a matter of being out of your league its a matter of making it your league and making it wok for you and those that you make contact with. Each person and each contact has a different level of understand and capability, some of us have the understanding that evp exists and try to use it. While some dont. Some have a very high level of understanding like the folks that frank and misty contact that can help you and make contact easier. Thats why we are all joined here in this group, we just wanna share talk and try to improvew what we have and gain a better knowledge of the options available.
so umm after this 10 minute rambling, please DO feel free to post you questions, im quite sure that you have ALOT, when i get going on something you will see me posting 20 or 30 questions and problems ive run into a day, just ask misty! LOL
Im on messenger too if you ever wanna talk in real time. I dont have the knowledge like frank n misty or time experience but i have done evp and gone on ghost hunts. I tried ITC on the pc and was unsucessful, i regret that i have no patience and give up easily, if it were not for getting my evp the first time i tried, some people take a long time to make contact, i would of gave up. hey look im still rambling on.

Hey, Lynn and Amy!
   
  I've been on this board for a month but haven't posted because I felt a little out of my depth. :) I joined because I've recently become interested in EVP and thought this would be a good place to get pointers on capturing EVP on tape.   I had never heard of ITC before joining and am currently learning what it's about (I bought a book about ITC just last week and am fascinated).
   
  Anyway, I'm moving to Kerrville (my home town) in a few weeks .... so that will be another board member in your "neighborhood."
   
  So, hello!  
   
  -Lanza
