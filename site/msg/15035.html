You are confusing the oscillation fr=
equency (vibration) of the air and our ear drums, with the oscillation freq=
uency of electromagnetic energy.=A0 

For example, we can hear sound waves =
between around 40 Hz at the lower end to about 16,000 Hz at the higher end.=
=A0 These are sound pressure waves.

In the EM spectrum. some of those regi=
ons are covered by radio VLF (3000 Hz to 30,000 hz), and ULF (300 Hz, to 30=
00hz). These are radio frequencies, and you can't hear them: they are elect=
romagnetic energy, traveling in photons (yes, it is valid to call non-visib=
le EM energy a photon).=A0

Tell me where the seperation on the spectrum takes p=
lace between 300Hz and 300KHz. Yes, soundwaves cause pressure waves that ou=
r ears read as vibration and our mind translates as sound. The waves are st=
ill on the electromagnetic spectrum. Even subsonic geomagnetic waves are pr=
esent on the scale. What I mean by power can be directll translated to volu=
me or amplitude. The only thing that distinguishes soundwaves from any othe=
r wave is the fact that we can hear them.

=A0
A mistake that a lot of =
people make is thinking that there are two different types of energy at wor=
k when it comes to sound waves and electromagnetic waves. The only thing th=
at seperates them is frequency and power. Radio waves are radio waves becau=
se they occupy a certain block of the electromagnietic spectrum. Sound wave=
s exist on that same spectrum just farther down with much longer waves. Sou=
ndwaves and subsonic waves can penetrate almost anything because of their w=
avelengths. The shorter the wavelength the more ways we can shield against =
them.
=A0
Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and telemetry=
 transmitting wave but the waves also have a physical effect on our environ=
ment by causing molecules to speed up, which creates heat. A little lower t=
han this is IR or infrared it too can cause physical objects to heat up but=
 usually it just causes molecules to rotate in place. All physical things g=
ive off IR light. Its a way the total system conserves energy by spontaneou=
sly emitting IR radiation.

Here is some food for thought. I am currently reviewing my audio f=
rom our May 30th investigation.
=A0
It was me and another girl teammate=A0p=
resent in the room. I picked up a 3rd female voice on my digital voice reco=
rder that I carry with me. We were standing right next to another digital v=
ideo recorder that I leave beside my night vision camera. That recorder did=
 not pick up this 3rd voice. I have asked the girl that was with me to chec=
k her recording to see if she picked it up.
=A0
I have long felt the true E=
VP does not come from sound waves in the environment, or then it wouldn't b=
e EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow EVP's are appearing directly on the=
 recordings.
=A0
This instance with the recorders may back that theory up. =
That other recorder should have picked that voice up if it were sound waves=
 in the environment.
=A0
I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. The=A0f=
ile that is named=A0"01-02-17 Clip" is the full clip.=A0You will hear my vo=
ice as I say "Yeah", and then another comes in right after that. I think I =
know what it says.
=A0
Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but still did=
 not hear this until playback. It isn't clear, so I am not as excited about=
 it as my one's from the last investigation.

I have a runnin=
g theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly =
where they want it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. If y=
ou mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequency then if yo=
u add or subtract them together you get a beat frequency or alternate frequ=
ency. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an =
electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you w=
ill have a intermediate difference=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within human h=
earing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic =
equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From this t=
heory I always felt that EVP were generated within a few inches of the reco=
rder.
=A0
We are able to reproduce this affect in not only radio with super=
heterodyne systems but also with acoustics and audio as in some passive son=
ars and a commercial produce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pom=
peii.
