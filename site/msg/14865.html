I have been following this group for a=
 year and from the message i wrote this is the first time I got a reply. No=
w Frank I think you work is quality and I definately want to learn more abo=
ut your work and what you do. and if you could advise me of where I can see=
 a profile of yourself that would be great. but dont start with the abusive=
 crap towards me.

Lets keep it clean. Again I was talking about Moon. not =

t not a big fan of Chris Moon.

 neck in about that, that was a pretty crappy thing first of all im not rel=

I will not address Frank again
------------ --------- --------- -=
-------- --------- --------- -

Frank,

This is getting ridiculous now, you=
 should stop writing these posts, all you are doing is making yourself look=
 ridiculous.

I have offered many times to make my raw recordings available=
 for review by anyone who wants them. I have made the same challenge to you=
r friend moon who we all know is behind this tirade he has time and again r=
efused or ignored the request for any type of audio file
to be publicly pos=
ted for revue and continues to take advantage of innocent unsuspecting peop=
le with his con game and charging large amounts of money for sessions where=
 he fabricates and makes up content as he goes along.

I was the only one t=
o confront him in public and expose him for the fake he is and this is his =
feeble attempt at retaliation. I and other researchers like me have brought=
 this research light years from where it was when you and I first met, moon=
 just continues to use it to rip people off and has not contributed a thing=
 to the research of ghost box communication beside lining his own pockets. =


Just the fact that he has you doing his dirty work shows the type of guy =
he is. I can remember a time when you publicly came out against any type of=
 money making using your boxes and even refused moon when he wanted to manu=
facture and sell them for large profits yet now you condone his robbery of =
innocent unaware people and actually act foolish on his behest.

Frank you =
are better than this, just concentrate on developing a better box and forge=
t about moon and his tricks and lies, he is finished in the paranormal and =
he knows it, everyone is wise to his game and he is practically an outcast.=


Frank you are hitching you wagon to a dead horse. Get away from these bad=
 influences before they ruin your reputation as well.

We have had this moo=
n discussion in the past and once he has exhausted his need for you he will=
 screw you again like he has done so many times before.

Frank, I like and =
respect you and I hope you will consider what I have said in this e-mail an=
d I sincerely hope you post this one on the evp-itc group. I will be postin=
g it on my group and others I belong to.

Your former friend
Bruce
