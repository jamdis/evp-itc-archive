 YAHOO.Shortcuts.overlaySpaceId = "97546169";  YAHOO.Shortcuts.hostSpaceId = "97546168";       the displacement current in a voltage divider may not be measurable with ordinary instruments.  thats why i go along with convention to the extent possible (almost always a good idea) and keep the question confined to the dielectric {insulator} in the capacitor.  thats a far more fruitful avenue anyway as evidenced by isolated miller effect {voltage variable capacitance) in spook radio which cannot be explained by orthodoxy.
   
  the fact that you dug out this key, but obscure , effect proves that you are getting the right idea , physics wise.
   
  i would like to see some excerpt from paper in question but it isnt extra-important.  sounds like brill has some functioning neurons.

  Here, I was waiting to hear back from my old

already knowing what they'd all say: How would you go
about measuring the displacement current in a typical
voltage divider circuit powered by the secondary coil
of a transformer using a two probe scope? I didn't
show any of them the paper or even describe it, I just
asked that very simple question. They all got it
right and they all said - displacement current doesn't
come into it. Because according to standard EM
theory, the only time displacement current matters at
all when it comes to circuit theory is in the midst of
capacitance. Now, according to Bearden's neo-EM
model, especially in this instance, it would in a
circuit like this. So for Reider to lay any credence
to his claim in light of the occidental EM model is
ludicrous. And he wasn't even talking about one of
Tom's designs, he was talking about one of
Jean-Louis'. Case closed.

Sorry, but I just can't help kicking a dead horse
until the steak is reeeeaaaal tender.
