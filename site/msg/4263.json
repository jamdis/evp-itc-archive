I have researched EVP since 1999, \nand saw a youtube video from Mike Coletta and it really raised my \nattention level. I watch the videos, went to radio shack, bought the \nequipment, and modified the 12-469. I recorded my first communication \nand I have to tell you that is has sparked a flame that has been out \nfor many years now. I have read almost every article about Frank&#39;s box \nand seen it in action at Waverly Hills with Chris Moon. Anywho I would \nlike to thank you guys for giving me a new investigation tool that \ngives realtime answers. Thanks also great job Mike with those vids and \nstep by step direction on your site."}
