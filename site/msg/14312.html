K, the one with 1927 in it is truly way down in with the static. I tried to let guys here at work listen to it. But they couldn't hear it either. I also was having trouble hearing it this morning. I have a different "clean" version (by it's self) without my talking to verify it's reason....but didn't upload it for that reason. Sometimes it is a good idea to download these files and use a program to "loop" the audio. I have a simple free download from somewhere that I am able to adjust the start and stop of the continual looping on the recording. The program is called VLC MEDIA PLAYER. Be careful, it wants to set itself to be defaults in may areas. But is great for adjusting the loop pattern to exactly where you need. I am not at my laptop right now, or I would try to send the filtered 1927. In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@... wrote:
