Hi Andy,
    I'm glad your first run turned out with amazing results.  Each time I get direct responses back it amazes still.  I really like the look on my mrs's face when I let her here one.  It cracks me up.  She doesn't do sessions with me or get involved in my research, but she'll listen to a clip every now and then.  

    As far as the batteries, yes, they will get drained if something is around.  I eventually switched over to another hacked radio that had a normal AC adapter power plug just to keep going.  


All the best,
Bryan

Thought I would let everyone know about my wife and I's first run with 
the modded 12-469 shack box today. As I stated, I was skeptical of the 
results, just by very method used would be hard to distinguish from 
coincidence. I was not prepeared, however,  for the results we got from 
my first use with this box.

Activity in our place has been on the rise, so I figured, wth, I will 
try it first in our own place. When I asked if present entities knew 
the name of the person's room we were in, we received the answer 
twice: "Kristen" once loudly, and again several seconds later a softer 
voice came through and repeated. The box accurately told my wife her 
own name as a means of validation, and advised it followed me home from 
a cemetery investigation several weeks ago. I have been investigating 
since 1999, so this isn't my first attachment, but this is my first 
confirmation via ITC. The box even said the name of the small rural 
town where the cemetery was.

I am not sure of the mechanism, and not sure if it isn't some PK 
element of the operators present or a legitimate external entity making 
contact, but...I must say I never expected the contextually accurate 
responses to immediate questioning. Goes without saying I will be 
conducting another session in the near future. One odd thing, the 
recorder I had running at the time inexplicably lost power (new batt) 
at 6:12 minutes in the middle of the session, so I missed recording the 
last half. I will upload the file as soon as I locate my now MIA patch 
cord.

Thanks all,
Andy
