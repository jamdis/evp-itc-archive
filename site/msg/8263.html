Hi Misty, &quot;inner energy&quot;, all,

maybe one could feed the SpeakJet allophones into EVPmaker. The attached
WAV file contains the 72 allophones of the SpeakJet chip. (I used
Audition to cut them out of the sample clip which has been posted here
recently, and store them in a cue list.) To use this file as an EVPmaker
source, the &quot;Use Cue List&quot; option must be checked. I have done a few short
sessions, and got this strange message:

                &quot;I little Sir help you eclipse.&quot;

(Doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me... lol)

Of course, this cannot replace a hardware version of SpeakJet, since
EVPmaker isn&#x27;t able to produce the proper transitions between the
allophones. But maybe it&#x27;s worth a try...

Stefan

&gt; I used the phrase &quot;the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&quot; in Stefan&#x27;s evpmaker and have had interesting results including some live. I tried other pangrams (contain every letter of english
&gt; alphabet) but the one I felt drawn to use was the one that has had the best results.
   
&gt;   No two sessions are ever alike and as background sound its easily modulated into quite complicated sentences and word structures.

&gt; If you could build a random event generator built on the spoken
&gt; letters of the alphabet,
&gt; that would definately be nice and very good.
