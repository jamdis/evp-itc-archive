<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m still working like mad to finish isolating more EVPs we got on 
our audio recorders. It seems to more I listen, the more I find...

Has anyone been brave enough to give ear to the ones I&#x27;ve posted so 
far?

Thanks,
Lance

&gt; Good Evening!
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ve been very busy today going through a long, intense audio 
&gt; recording taken at the Gainesville, Texas house, which my team 
&gt; investigated on Sunday, November 25th.
&gt; 
&gt; All of the EVPs I just posted were gathered in the unoccupied 
&gt; upstairs bedroom. Only three investigators were present in the 
room. 
&gt; Their voices have been properly taken into account and ruled out as 
&gt; sources of the actual EVPs. 
&gt; 
&gt; The new and resampled EVPs have been saved as .mp3 files. They can 
be 
&gt; freely downloaded from the site here -
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.filecrunch.com/user/orbhunterx
&gt; 
&gt; You will hear quite a few odd words, dog barks, and even mimicry. 
&gt; Some of the voices are faint and whispery. Other EVP voices sound 
&gt; like the invisibles are standing right along side the researchers!
&gt; 
&gt; Sexual Content Warning:
&gt; 
&gt; Several of the EVPs have strong sexual content. 
&gt; 
&gt; Please read the file name prior to downloading.
&gt; 
&gt; Listening to the EVPs will be at your own disgression.
&gt; 
&gt; That stated, those that choose to listen to the EVPs, please let me 
&gt; know if any of them need further contextual clarification. I look 
&gt; forward to hearing feedback. As it stands, the true nature of 
what&#x27;s 
&gt; going on in the house awaits much more serious attention.
