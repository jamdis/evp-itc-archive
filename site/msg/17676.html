<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Sorry, just tired of trying to defnd this stuff to self proclaimed skeptics
that accept absolutely no evidence, and catagorically ignore/reject every
researchers EVP and results.

 I&#x27;ll post what I got Friday, even it doesn&#x27;t mean anything.

&gt; Well, I was going to try to objectively compare your statements to anything
&gt; that might happen on Thursday.  Why get so defensive over that?
&gt;
&gt; And why not just post the full details?  It&#x27;s not really a prediction if
&gt; you post the details after the fact.  Something a little better than
&gt; &quot;Wait... Navy&quot;, which says nothing really.

&gt;  So you&#x27;re just sitting there with baited breath hoping and praying nothing
&gt; will happen so you can puff out chest and say see I told you it&#x27;s all BS.
&gt;
&gt;  I do have more information for the date, but not posting till afterwards.
&gt; If it&#x27;s real, I don&#x27;t want it getting out to soon.  I did tell a couple
&gt; others so you can&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s prediction after the fact. Doesn&#x27;t matter
&gt; though, cuz the skeptics ignore all facts anyway.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Starts out &quot;next month the 17th&quot; Don&#x27;t know what that is, but I&#x27;ve heard
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; &gt; several times in various recordings. But wait, this is AM, where&#x27;s the
&gt;&gt; usual
&gt;&gt; &gt; interference? At 5 seconds &quot;Wait---Navy&quot;, maybe that has to do with the
&gt;&gt; old
&gt;&gt; &gt; disaster.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Oh crap! I forgot to ask for the scientfic aproval before posting.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Admittedly, I was being mean spirited on purpose, I&#x27;m not going to allow
&gt;&gt; &gt; some science dork to brow beat me into submission. I believe the home
&gt;&gt; page
&gt;&gt; &gt; of EVP-ITC says something to the effect that we don&#x27;t follow science,
&gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt; &gt; is for sharing information, and using the cut and try method, see what
&gt;&gt; &gt; works. I know everyone hears different, and that&#x27;s ok, that does not
&gt;&gt; &gt; invalidate this stuff. My apologies for ruffling feathers.
