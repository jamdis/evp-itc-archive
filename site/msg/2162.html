&gt; The researcher is always part of the equation. The spirit is not  
&gt; talking to the recorder! I record EVP and DRV everyday, with great  
&gt; results. I have been recording with a ITC group since March which  
&gt; seems to have &quot;boosted&quot; the clarity of the messages we get.  
&gt; Resonance is the key!

You had me at &quot;part of the equation.&quot; You&#x27;re right: resonance is the  
key, indeed, HMO.

&gt;
&gt; If you look at people who get consistent results everytime you will  
&gt; find that they are connected to something greater than themselves.  
&gt; They are usually even tempered with very little extreme emotions.  
&gt; Their interests do not lie in the mechanism of communication so  
&gt; much or gathering evidence to prove or disprove a theory. They are  
&gt; interested in the message and the connection we have with the  
&gt; spirits we all have around us. Its how our own spirit (who we  
&gt; really are) connects with the ones we are speaking with.
&gt; Everyone has heard the term, &quot;like attracts like&quot;. This is a crude  
&gt; basis for resonance! Your spiritual progress or rate of vibration  
&gt; determines what kind of etherial crowd you will attract and hang  
&gt; out with. A lot of the viewpoints of investigators comes from the  
&gt; belief that we are primarily physical beings. This is an automatic  
&gt; belief because of the conditioning and programming we have received  
&gt; by our societies all our lives. What the spirits have been telling  
&gt; us for thousands of years in scriptures, spiritual teachings,  
&gt; inspired philosophy and so on is that we are primarily spiritual  
&gt; beings. We are the &quot;ghost in the machine&quot;, not the machine.

This is what I wanted to say, too, but you said it much more  
coherently than I could have. Personal, aside, when I try to  
communicate with the Other Side, by any number of means, mediumistic  
or mechanical, I always begin by envisioning myself either picking up  
a phone with the cord running way up into a star-filled sky, or I  
imagine that I am a radio and I am tuning myself higher up the band.  
I&#x27;ve done this since I was a little kid.

&gt;
&gt; Now, I know many of you who actually take the time to read all this  
&gt; will try to write these words off as some kind of personal belief  
&gt; of mine or a unsupported philosophy. In fact everything I have just  
&gt; stated is supported by 30 years of messages received from the 70&#x27;s  
&gt; to the present through ITC contacts all over the world.
&gt;
&gt; So to validate your belief Bill, yes it very much depends on the  
&gt; person who is recording the EVP! ;)
&gt;

It&#x27;s also increasingly supported by quantum physics.
