<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My work room out in the garage, and spiders come in. I told them, yeah I
talk to bugs--bite me and I gas everyone of ya! They stay outta sight. So
this was recorded in the garage last night &quot;Us, (or house) Spiders Speak&quot;
at 15 seconds. Brain is not mind, anything that lives, thinks, ghost voices
are thoughts. If man thinks he is so advanced, how many can control eight
legs and spin a web? How many eyes does a fly need if there is no intellect
to process the information? Humans vastly underestimate the rest of nature.
Human ego, unjustifiable.

 These big radios make better boxes because the quality of the radio is
better. Better front end, not so easlily overloaded by strong nearby
signals, and better IF filter(the down conversion process), less surious
signals, clearer sound. Larger audio amplifiers, and less distortion.
