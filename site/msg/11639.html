<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>hey folks!

now that i have finished moving, boy am I glad that i finally located 
my recorder, radio, and (what took forever to find) the CORD that 
connects the recorder to the computer! 
I feel SO out of the loop- but I did a short session today and I 
finally started to get some responses.... not the clearest ive ever 
had, but better than nothing... apparently someone needs help going 
home so i will do my best to assist.
Anyway, looks like you all have been busy bees while i have been up 
to my eyeballs in packing tape and boxes!! lol
Im glad to finally be back and in action again and cant wait to see 
if Monique and Peter are still lurking about.....
( my dog has been alerting me to unseen presences on a few occaisions 
here, ) so i imagine it wont be long before they start chattering at 
me again..lol
cheers!
