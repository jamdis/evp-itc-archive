Did the \nhack this afternoon surprising simple!! So if anyone can please help \nme with what else I need to get started I would appreciate it.  I do \nhave some PC speakers and a small microphone to use. Not sure how to \nset it up.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Thanks \n&gt;   Kay\n&gt; \n&gt; Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;             For me it was the 12-469, It has worked well with me.  \nI did buy a 20-125, and hacked it correctly, and I didn&#39;t like it.  I \nalso didn&#39;t get very much reception.  The 20-125 has a long anntena, \nand the 12-469 you can hold it in your hand, and you act as the \nanntena.  That way you get better reception.  Only problem with the \n12-469 is that it clicks a little, but I can&#39;t hear it anymore.  I \ntrain not to hear it.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Later \n&gt;   Rees\n&gt; \n&gt; psfponies &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;         I am looking at getting either the 12-469 or 20-125. Which \nwould be the best to get for someone who is just starting out. I will \nbe doing the Hack myself with a little help and instructions. I want \nto get something fairly easy to hack and use for a beginner.\n&gt;   Thanks\n&gt;   Kay\n&gt; \n&gt; Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;     Radio Shack FM/AM Radio 12-469 or 20-125\n&gt; \n&gt; Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;         Radio Shack 12-469, 20-125 then you would have to modifiy \nit.  Some peps here can tell you how to do it, or you can go to \nufogeek.com, and watch a video on how to do it.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Rees\n&gt; \n&gt; darkstarwolf2002 &lt;darkstarwolf2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;       been camping and reading post\n&gt; \n&gt; I am the founder Of Trinity Paranormal&#39;s Western Oregon Chapter.
