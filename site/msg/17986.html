Here are a few of the things I got for your session  concerning your 
question, RJ, I put some of the words as I was able to hear  them, if you don't 
want to know the way I heard them just click them open to  listen and don't 
look and see what you can make out. A couple were too  "religious" for some 
people I guess, so I left them off.  It took about 4  minutes in all. enjoy 
all, sf
