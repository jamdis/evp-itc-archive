I think it&#39;s at Mark&#39;s website still.\n   \n  I agree with you about MacRae and Presi--amazing.  The current issue of the ITC Journal is devoted to Marcello Bacci&#39;s work--also incredible.\n   \n  What&#39;s interesting about the idea of these guys recording themselves to prove it is that it seems a debunker mentality has a negative effect on getting results!  Of course, this is frustrating.  Nonetheless, sooner or later, I would think they would have to stand up and take notice.  After all, it wasn&#39;t long ago that the idea of  telephones was considered ludicrous and yet all these debunkers use them regularly with no problem at all as to their authenticity ;)  Vicki\n\npsi_research &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hey Vicki, I did get a Luminator photo. Mine appeared a bit dark but I \nshould examine it again. \n\nI was equally impressed with Alex MacRae and Paolo Presi for their \nkeen scientific scrutiny of the phenomenon. Even under close \nexamination, some submitted EVP&#39;s appear to be genuine paranormal \nphenomenon. EVP recordings are being subjected to some of the most \nvigorous digital forensic analysis techniques available. Of course, \nmany supposed EVP&#39;s can be debunked, but those considered supernatural \nin origin are classified as such due to audio characteristics that to \nnot comply with our physical world as science currently understands \nit. I would recommend any of the doubters to not jump to conclusions \nuntil reviewing the work of some of these great researchers. \n\nBetter yet, I recommend attempting to record EVP&#39;s themselves. Be \npatient, but diligent. Nothing convinces a person faster than personal \nexperience.\n\nCheers, Bill\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Vicki Talbott &lt;vtalbott1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Bill,\n&gt; Good to see you here!
