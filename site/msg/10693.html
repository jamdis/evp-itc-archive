<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>OK, here is the comment I have posted.  We&#x27;ll see if it gets approved:

I was skeptical about the various radio sweep methods out there, until I tried them for 
myself.  While this method is especially vulnerable to &#x27;false positives&#x27;, I observed a number 
of  phenomena which couldn&#x27;t easily be explained:

* The spoken response phrase is directly relevant to my proceeding question or comment, 
and in some cases it was immediate, just as it would be in a normal conversation.
* The duration of the phrase lasts for several seconds, far longer than what could have 
come from a single broadcasting station.
* The words are spoken in a single tone of voice, thereby ruling out that it was simply a 
fortuitous assembly of broadcast fragments.
* The intonation and cadence are suggestive of normal human speech patterns.
* Multiple people agree upon the proposed interpretation of the response.
* In several instances, the voice has been identified by a loved on as being &quot;just like&quot; that 
of the person when here in the physical.  

I realize the last item in my list is subjective, but when combined with the other 
observations, it believe it makes an overall persuasive argument for the validity of the 
various techniques that fall in the radio sweep family.

Perhaps a little experimenting of your own would have you feeling differently?

&gt; Hi LK.  I used to want to educate people like this, but have somewhat reached a point 
&gt; where I feel it&#x27;s not worth the time and effort.  Perhaps though, I will shoot her over the 
&gt; article I wrote on radio sweep.  It was included in the most recent AAEVP news journal 
and 
&gt; seemed to be received well, even by those previously unopen to the idea of the validity 
of 
&gt; this technique.

&gt; &gt; Hi Guys, here&#x27;s a site I thought you all would be interested in...this site is dogging the 
&gt; works being done. She is a 20 year old lady that has a paranormal group in England. I 
&gt; think she needs some educating. Anyone interested? Here is her link to her site.
