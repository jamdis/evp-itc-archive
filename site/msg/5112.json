Nada, \nnothing, zilch.  Maybe because I only get to scan past 5 to 8 \nchannels on Am or FM so I don&#39;t have enough signals to muster a \nresponse.  But from what you and others with experience seem to be \nsaying, it shouldn&#39;t matter because I will get help from someone on \nthe other-side.  Maybe they can&#39;t find me in Mexico?  Please let your \ntechs know I am here...should be no problem with immigration papers \nor money exchange.  I really need help.

She&#39;s very dominant every time I run a session and I&#39;ve gotten \nsome good stuff from her, which I will shortly be able to post, I \nhope. About a week ago, I got a really extraordinary sequence that \nran something along the lines of a male saying, &quot;Lisa, can you do \nit?&quot; followed by a clear female voice saying, &quot;Testing. Beginning. \nGround,&quot; and then a second female voice saying &quot;Kick.&quot; I was floored.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, Lisa seems to be the driver of a lot of what is going on \nright now. Maybe she intends to work with a number of us?\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   -----Original Message----- \n&gt; From: bruce halliday \n&gt; Sent: Jan 8, 2008 9:22 AM \n&gt; To: evp-itc@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] Re: A file from Frank&#39;s box #12 pertaining \nto lisby&#39;s technition \n&gt; \n&gt;         Frank,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have two techs that I speak with on a daily basis and one of them\n&gt; is Lisa.

I hear Lisa&#39;s name at least a dozen \n&gt; &gt; times each time I run a session, so I feel confident that she is \n&gt; &gt; there, so I feel confident that I&#39;m not in the hands of someone I \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t want to be in.
