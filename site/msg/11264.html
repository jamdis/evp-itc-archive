This is my opinion
 
It might sound better, but I get better results w=
ith the 469.  I have had both of the 820 & 125 from the SHACK, and=
 I got better results with the 469.  It was such a big difference that=
 I took them back (hacked) to the store and got my cash back.  I don't=
 think there are much difference in the radio's than the home made boxes, b=
ut my only problem is that I haven't tested with any homemade boxes yet.&nb=
sp; Time will only tell when I make the homemade box if I can get the parts=
.
