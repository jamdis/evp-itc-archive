<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m not trying to prove anything to anyone. I know what I&#x27;ve got and what I
haven&#x27;t got. I know when I&#x27;ve gotten something that can&#x27;t be explained and I
know I didn&#x27;t fake the recordings.

I was on an investigation of a former mental hospital in Illinois a few
years ago, and during one recording I made, all of us in the group were
looking at a shadow figure moving a distance away. A hoarse, whispery voice
came in on the recording and said a name. None of us would have thought of
saying that particular name. None of us heard this voice with our ears at
the time of the recording. I got it simultaneously on both a pocket digital
voice recorcer and on the audio of a video tape.

A couple weeks later, someone in the group got into the hospital records and
found that a man with that name had died of typhoid fever in the mental
hospital in 1938. None of us knew that at the time of the investigation. The
probability of anyone else knowing it at the time is very very small.

No doubt someone who doesn&#x27;t know me would say it was faked somehow. But
like I said, I don&#x27;t care. I know it wasn&#x27;t.

&gt;
&gt;  So where&#x27;s your evidence, your recordings? Let me guess, they&#x27;re being
&gt; analyzed. I didn&#x27;t start this thread. just chimming in that I get similar
&gt; voices.
&gt;
&gt;  This ain&#x27;t evidence per se`, as the source is unknown, all we can do is
&gt; present what we get. I&#x27;ve alwasy said there&#x27;s something that talks that
&gt; shouldn&#x27;t be there, and that&#x27;s all. You can&#x27;t know who it is, or what it is,
&gt; that doesn&#x27;t make it useless. But as soon as we present what we get there&#x27;s
&gt; always some clown that wants to pick it apart and try to take away all
&gt; meaning and experience. So if you want critcial thinking and consistent
&gt; evidence go hang out on JREF.

&gt;&gt;   You say the &#x27;bitch&#x27; comes out when you feel you&#x27;re being spoken down
&gt;&gt; to, yet you start threads on you own (like this one) where you attack those
&gt;&gt; who hold different opinions than yours, but who have said nothing against
&gt;&gt; you.  Skeptic simply means not believing things just because someone claims
&gt;&gt; it.  Anyone on the internet who is NOT a skeptic is in danger of losing a
&gt;&gt; lot of money to Nigerian bankers.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; No testing I&#x27;ve ever seen, whether my own or from others, has shown me
&gt;&gt; results that could be shown to only have come from some paranormal
&gt;&gt; entities.  That is, while one could claim it did, there was nothing about it
&gt;&gt; that also couldn&#x27;t be explained as coming from just the misinterpretation of
&gt;&gt; noise, or of random radio broadcast snippets.  And so I see no reason to
&gt;&gt; explain the results by claiming they come from ghosts or aliens when a more
&gt;&gt; mundane explanation works just as well.  Well one reason maybe: its more fun
&gt;&gt; to believe.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Many people who claim a more exotic explanation also, curiously, claim it
&gt;&gt; can&#x27;t be tested or verified.  While those who claim it is based on personal
&gt;&gt; interpretation of noise and random broadcast, can and do test that theory
&gt;&gt; just fine.  Again, this could be explained by some incredibly complex system
&gt;&gt; of ghost-rules where ghosts aren&#x27;t allowed to communicate in good grammar,
&gt;&gt; and are required to make only bad predictions or spew irrelevant comments,
&gt;&gt; or must perform poorly only when being tested.  Or it could be explained
&gt;&gt; simply by accepting that the tests are good, and that it is the claims
&gt;&gt; being  tested that are bogus.   I think it takes a lot of dancing to believe
&gt;&gt; the former over the latter.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Again, being skeptical means not simply accepting  claims, especially
&gt;&gt; unusual ones, without some critical thinking and investigation.  It doesn&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; mean that the claims deserve to be rejected outright, just as it doesn&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; mean rejecting everything we know about history and science.  There is
&gt;&gt; nothing wrong with demanding evidence of unusual claims.  But not just
&gt;&gt; evidence: good evidence, evidence gathered under controlled conditions.
&gt;&gt; Personal claims about ghosts are not good evidence.  Recordings that can
&gt;&gt; only be understood once someone is first told what they are supposed to
&gt;&gt; hear, is not good evidence.  The only good evidence we have are the claims
&gt;&gt; where the recordings are said to predict something: and then that something
&gt;&gt; doesn&#x27;t happen.  Unfortunately, that is good evidence that this is just
&gt;&gt; random sounds, not that their is any intelligence lying to us.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Notice also, that if I am a skeptic, I do not need to call those who are
&gt;&gt; not skeptical, or are convinced that their are ghosts on their radio, names
&gt;&gt; or other insulting things.  I do not feel the need to be defensive, because
&gt;&gt; I have nothing to defend.  I just ask for, look for, and wait for, better
&gt;&gt; evidence.  Nothing would make me happier to find proof of an afterlife,
&gt;&gt; beyond just claims and televangelists and shows on tv.  That&#x27;s why I comment
&gt;&gt; about claims of proof that I don&#x27;t think hold water. Because I think real
&gt;&gt; proof is important.  And bogus proof is the primary obstacle to finding the
&gt;&gt; good stuff.

&gt;&gt; I have had numrerous instance where they show a knowledge of what I will
&gt;&gt; see and hear in the near future, which is good enough for me. For reasons I
&gt;&gt; don&#x27;t understand we are seemingly not allowed to get the proof you want, at
&gt;&gt; least not in af rom that it can be shared, so you have to prove it to
&gt;&gt; yourself.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The bitch comes out when I think I&#x27;m being talked down to. You speak like
&gt;&gt; a typical skeptic, demanding evidence and accepting none, nor doing your own
&gt;&gt; damn home work and testing for your self.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I would suggest that the &#x27;better way&#x27; is to drop the drama, the insults,
&gt;&gt; and the name calling. Keep an open mind, and test claims. If the claim is
&gt;&gt; that something catastrophic is going to happen in 2012, wait and see, then
&gt;&gt; decide the reliability of the source. If the claim is that ghosts are
&gt;&gt; talking on my radio, test that claim, and then decide on the reliability of
&gt;&gt; those making the claim, and those disputing it.
