Last summer=\r\n some kids came down into the basement wiht the younger grandson, and the l=\r\nittle yorkie barked, but &quot;get outta here&quot; came out, some how. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Yeah, I think I was too hard on RJ. I don&#39;t know wh=\r\ny, but testing doens&#39;t seem to work, but we get enough to prove this to our=\r\nselves. It&#39;s probably a faith thing, although I&#39;m not religious, even anti-=\r\nreligion.&nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;F-S&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;On Fri, Aug 20, 2010 at 6:27 PM, &lt;span=\r\n dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SnowfireL@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote=\r\n:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);&quot;&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv style=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 12px; font-weight: 700;&quot;&gt;[&lt;a rel=3D&quot;=\r\nnofollow&quot; style=3D&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;https:=\r\n//mail.google.com/mail/?ui=3D2&amp;view=3Djs&amp;name=3Dmain,tlist&amp;ver=\r\n=3D9oD1J7yvz5o.en.&amp;am=3D%21xONyw1plirqxhZ4a1PIWg1xlTveuJ8oWIzqJ6mz0Dt83=\r\nht4Zrp4&amp;fri#12a920b21a6295da_TopText&quot;&gt;Attachment(s)&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a rel=3D&quot;=\r\nnofollow&quot;&gt;SnowfireL@...&lt;/a&gt; included below]&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#=\r\n000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Here is a short file, where someone=\r\n says, &quot;Scamp, Scamp,&quot; then Scamp barks. &quot;yap.&quot;&nbsp; This little dog belon=\r\nged to my grandma, when I was about 9 or 10 years old, he was a Manchester =\r\nTerrier, and lived with us for many years, and this is his bark for sure.&n=\r\nbsp; I&#39;d know that bark anywhere.&nbsp; Sorry, that I can&#39;t make it any cle=\r\narer, I need to get one of those better ghost boxes I guess.&nbsp;&nbsp;RJ,=\r\n spirits are just like us, they are not omnipresent like God,&nbsp;&nbsp;pr=\r\nobably why David doesn&#39;t want to play the guessing game, he has better thin=\r\ngs to do over there, and has said, they have thousands of people standing i=\r\nn this long line waiting to get into the Heavens, and He can&#39;t just drop Hi=\r\ns job and go to your house to see what you have over there, He did tell me =\r\nthat first time what it was, and i sent it to you, but it was too late.&nbs=\r\np; It&#39;s hard for me to understand them sometimes, He was also right about t=\r\nhat little boy, Syler being\n killed, and where his body would be found, I d=\r\non&#39;t know what they did about it though. sf&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/=\r\np&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;=\r\n/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv style=3D&quot;color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n \n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/=\r\ntr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-593871395-1282515411=:50198--"}
