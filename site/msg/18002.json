In other \nwords, when was \nthe audio actually recorded?  T=\r\nhis issue can be mitigated  simply by \nrequiring any\nclaimant to email the =\r\naudio file to a trusted party before the  test ends. \nIt would be best \nif =\r\nthe trusted party were not otherwise involved in the  experiment and it \nwa=\r\ns  their duty \nsimply to collect the claims. Once all claims had been  coll=\r\nected they \ncould be posted \npublicly for review by the community in genera=\r\nl.  The  experimenter could \ndecide if any \nof the claims seemed to have hi=\r\nt, and this decision could be  reviewed by \nanyone if desired. \n \nThe impor=\r\ntant detail however is that this experiment does not  completely \nanswer th=\r\ne \nquestion. It is a first attempt and certainly can be improved on  \nsucce=\r\nssive trials.\n \nSuccessive trials are always a good idea, since it provides=\r\n  replication. \nAnd it would be\nbest if others replicated the experiment us=\r\ning a very similar  protocol. If \nthese were to\nsucceed, the community coul=\r\nd then state that out of X trials Y  had \nsucceeded (by \nsome definition of=\r\n success) potentially giving a success  rate above that \nexpected \nby rando=\r\nm chance. This would make the outcome quantifiable and  measureable \nand th=\r\nus meaningful.\n \nBut also important to note, this would only prove the pote=\r\nntial  veracity \nof the messages.\nIt would not (and cannot as far as I can =\r\ntell) prove the origin  of the \nmessages.
