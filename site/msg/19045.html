<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>When I use my Minibox Pluses and I strictly use a random jump setting on
them because it always gives me startlingly clear communications.  When  I
use the Joe&#x27;s Box, it is strictly linear and provides the same amount of
communication, just not as clearly.

Do you have any opinions on why you think random works better with your
boxes?

I hear the first two messages. For the message at .11, I could not make out
the first part but the second part sounds like &quot;Fuck the people,&quot; not &quot;for
the people.&quot;  I did not hear anything in the last one.

&gt;  I send this type of box out and invariably I hear back &quot;that doesn&#x27;t
&gt; work!&quot; This is single supply random mode, seems to work here! Starts out
&gt; &quot;--be good&quot;, at 4 seconds &quot;This is to calm Chris down&quot;, at 11 seconds &quot;this
&gt; is recorded for the people&quot;, and at the end &quot;the girl is seventeen&quot; --I get
&gt; that alot, and I don&#x27;t why it is important. &quot;They&quot; claim the &quot;princess&quot; was
&gt; kidnapped, it&#x27;s the one thing I do remember, and at the same age she was,
&gt; 17,  I actually relived the event, so maybe it&#x27;s for validation. I don&#x27;t
&gt; believe in living in the past,  reliving past traumas, or grieving.
&gt;  I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m still uncertain if random has an advantage, the messages
&gt; seem longer and in a more natural sounding voice.
&gt;
&gt;  Single supply random takes some finessing to make it work, so I prefer to
&gt; use dual supplies. + and - 12 volts.===more batteries==more $$$ to operate.
