 Many have concerns about the paranormal, and whether or not it's a safe a=
rea of exploration. Personally, I don't feel in-dangered, and I like a chal=
lenge, but I can't say the same for everyone, and I have seen some behavior=
 with box users, and in the paranormal in general that makes me wonder, suc=
h as "box user's" outbursts. Were "they" like that "before", or is it a res=
ult of messing with something we don't understand? (not mentioning any name=
s) I would hate to think I made something that got people possessed, or som=
ething. Everyone wants the paranormal to fit their beliefs, and the nature =
of the paranormal is to comply. It's the force, it's energy, it'll do what =
you expect. If ya think it's demons, it is, if ya think it's all elves and =
faeries, that's what it is, ghosts-yeah that and purple alien girls too! Yo=
u'll get the irrefruteable evidence to confirm what you think. It's a level=
 of the astral, it's what ever mind thinks it is. It(life?) can be a trap i=
f ya take it to serious. This--- is a good joke Great Spirit!   That's my o=
pinion, and I'm not stickin' to it. It just doesn't matter, cuz the rich gu=
ys get all the chicks anyway! (from a Chevy Chase movie, I think)    I don'=
t believe in absolutes.  I know something talks, but it defies explanation,=
 at least from this level. It's an intelligence, and I love hearing it, and=
 it keeps me intrigued, but I'm not going to put it in a box, saying it's t=
his, that, or the other thing.   I don't do interviews, and few talks cuz I=
 don't know what this is, and I am not going stand up and act like some exp=
ert. I think most know my stance, that's why I never got the invite for TAP=
S-Con. I don't believe in hauntings--as such, and I publicly contradicted/d=
