[2 Attachments]\n\n Been gettng something aobut May 17th, now &quot;they&quot; say it starts May\r\n15th--I&#39;m like WTF is this? There seems to be othere that have  pridistion\r\nas well, but it&#39;s almost as reliable as this stuff. This is from EVPmkaer\r\ntonight, using the origianl raw files I used ten years ago.\r\n\r\n&quot;Thanks for writing Frank!  However, it was not me who made the\r\nprediction....I was talking about a Christian scholar who has done some\r\nresearch and through his recalculation has determined that the predicted\r\n2012 shift will be occurring around May 17th 2011...he also says this is the\r\ndate when Jesus will be returning to Earth.  Very interesting, we&#39;ll\r\nsee......&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nSoooo, whatever.\r\n\r\nF-S"}
