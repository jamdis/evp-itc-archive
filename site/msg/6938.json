That&#39;s funny because i was \ndoing a \n&gt;   session over Skype with my sister and i told my sister i had to \ngo and \n&gt;   eat and the box said &quot;Yeah Pizza&quot;. They were close, i was having \nfood \n&gt;   delivered from a pizza place but i was having lasagna. Either way \ni \n&gt;   think they like pizza. Maybe it&#39;s all they serve over there???\n&gt; \n&gt;   -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, \nFrank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; \n&gt;   wrote:\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; This is the &quot;Ghostman&quot; an old digital Walkman, with a sweep \n&gt;   generator, amplifiers to drive stereo speakers, and line output \nfor a \n&gt;   recorder.
