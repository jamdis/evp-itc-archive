Glad you like my photographs!\n\n  I=\r\nnteresting question about the interference of radiation with my equipment. =\r\nNo, I didn&#39;t have any problems; the radiation levels are far too low to hav=\r\ne any effect on electronics or optical elements. As contaminated the zone i=\r\ns, I received during my stay a radiation dose of only about 5 microsieverts=\r\n, which is half of what you get at a dental X-ray. I guess if I would have =\r\nentered the sarcophagus, where the radiation is the highest (much, much hig=\r\nher than anywhere else in the zone), there would have been additional noise=\r\n on my pictures. But radiation diminishes exponentially the farther away yo=\r\nu are from the source, so the effect of what&#39;s inside the reactor flats out=\r\n within a couple of dozen meters or so. The overall background radiation is=\r\n not high enough to have any immediate effect on people or equipment.\n\n  Ho=\r\nwever, shortly after the accident in 1986, the cleanup crews tried to use r=\r\nemote-controlled robots to get rid of the contaminated graphite pieces on t=\r\nhe roof. Those robots broke down after only a few hours, due to the radiati=\r\non, which was so high it would kill you within only a short time.\n\n  I hope=\r\n this answers your question,\n  Best regards from Switzerland, Timm&quot;\n\nIn add=\r\nition, here are some other sources of info on the subject:\n\n  Effects of Ra=\r\ndiation on Electronic Equipment\n  http://radlab.nl/radsafe/archives/9602/ms=\r\ng00492.html\n\n  Radiation damage to electronic equipment\n  http://www.hps.or=\r\ng/publicinformation/ate/q3172.html\n\nAfter reading these reports, it seems t=\r\nhey don&#39;t really know because it is like saying rocks are brown. Well yeah-=\r\nsome rocks are brown, but there are so many rocks in the universe, one can =\r\nhardly make any effective statement at all.\n\nBut what I got from it, is tha=\r\nt for an electronic device to be effected, it has to be poorly shielded.\n\nE=\r\nven the most sensitive equipment us ghost hunters use would probably not be=\r\n effected. Even in the highest radiation levels at Chernobyl, it isn&#39;t high=\r\n enough to get past the shielding.\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From=\r\n: Rj \n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, October 04, 2009 10:12=\r\n AM\n  Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] A Question on Radiation\n\n\n    It doesn&#39;t reall=\r\ny matter if it&#39;s a &quot;point event&quot; (by which I assume you mean a short burst)=\r\n.   It depends on a lot of things: the type and sensitivity of the equipmen=\r\nt; its environment; the types of radiation to which it is exposed; and its =\r\nintensity and duration.  \n\n        As regards chenobyl, there was a lot of =\r\nradioactice material released into the environment, and which still causes =\r\nproblems, especially as the material blown into surrounding soils is releas=\r\ned, even to enter the  foodchain.

The biggest example often cited=\r\n is the electromagnetic pulse put off by a nuclear blast, that can disable =\r\nelectronic equipment.
