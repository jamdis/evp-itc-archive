&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; When it comes to EVP, I was one of the most cynical/skeptical people ever.
&gt; Well, I was until about two weeks ago.
&gt;
&gt; Then, a box cut me off in the middle of a rhetorical question. It was
&gt; speaking clearly -- and directly to me -- from across the room. That got my
&gt; attention in a hurry.
&gt;
&gt; Electronics is not my field, so I won&#x27;t pretend to understand how the box
&gt; works, but I&#x27;m pretty darned sure it&#x27;s not all in my head.
&gt;
&gt; Though I was a very busy speaker that weekend, I kept trying to be around
&gt; the box during our ghost investigations, etc., just to hear more.
&gt;
&gt; It would be so much simpler if I could shrug this off and say, &quot;It&#x27;s
&gt; probably just my imagination.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Instead, I want to know more about the voices, what they&#x27;re saying, why
&gt; they&#x27;re saying what they do, and... well, what they are.
&gt;
&gt; To me, this is fascinating because of the potential variables.
&gt;
&gt; But, this isn&#x27;t convenient and it wasn&#x27;t what I had in mind when I packed
&gt; my bag to speak in Canada. Right now, I should be finishing three books I&#x27;m
&gt; writing, one of which is very overdue.
&gt;
&gt; Instead, I&#x27;m sitting here, wide-eyed, listening to recordings posted to
&gt; this Yahoo Group, and I&#x27;m trying to put this into a context that I can
&gt; easily compartmentalize.
&gt;
&gt; So far, that&#x27;s not working. I&#x27;m finding no easy answers.
&gt;
&gt; Oh, I&#x27;m grateful to each person who&#x27;s posting their recordings. Thank you!
&gt; But each recording makes me even more sure that I haven&#x27;t a clue what this
&gt; is... and that&#x27;s a challenge that&#x27;s singing a siren song.
&gt;
&gt; Cheerfully,
&gt; Fiona

&gt; &gt; The bellyaching is cuz we get these people that proclaim to know all
