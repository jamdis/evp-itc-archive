<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The Sony Headphone, the same one from 2009, the one that says &quot;.......earth
is doomed&quot; at the end. It&#x27;s also the only Sony headphone radio I&#x27;ve ever
found.  I don&#x27;t know why, but after that I couldn&#x27;t get it to sweep, and now
it works.

 These things almost seem to have a mind of their own, I was having trouble
with the sound distortion in 86 and thought it was a bad tuner so I replaced
it. I needed a part and was going to rob it off the tuner from 86, and I
could not hold on to that board, it seemed to almost jump out of my hand. I
got the message and reused that tuner in 86, and it turned out to be a power
problem, not the tuner.

&gt; Random sweep, at 3 seconds &quot;Hultay keeps getting an awful love&quot;, I don&#x27;t
&gt; know what it means, but it seems clearer than usual.  I&#x27;ve noticed this with
&gt; random, if and when it works, that the phrases are more connected and
&gt; longer, and radio broadcasts tend to disappear.  they also talk about Hultay
&gt; often.
