In my own experience with the one group, and  \n&gt; what other spirits have told me about them, I tend to think, there  \n&gt; are 2 groups.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The group that Sandra talks about is very helpful, but she doesn&#39;t  \n&gt; have enough info. on her site for me to actually examine the group  \n&gt; she dealt with. Mr. Smith (AAEVP) refers to them as demons. I&#39;m not  \n&gt; sure I&#39;d go that far, but yeah, ok - my experience was fairly  \n&gt; nasty. Was that because they are so called &quot;demons&quot; which I think  \n&gt; is a ridiculous term btw, or just immature, yet very clever spirits  \n&gt; who get a kick out of causing trouble - or trying to? I just don&#39;t  \n&gt; know.\n&gt;\n&gt; From hearing both descriptions, I&#39;d say there may be 2 groups or  \n&gt; maybe only one &quot;real&quot; Fish Group and another band of roving nasty  \n&gt; spiritual beasties who want you to think they&#39;re the Fish Group to  \n&gt; give them an &quot;in&quot; to talk to you - invade your world so to speak.\n&gt;\n&gt; If they said they were a band of crazy demons, would you talk to  \n&gt; them? lol! :D\n&gt; But if they said they&#39;re the Fish Group, I&#39;d be like OH!

I always try  \n&gt;&gt; to follow the crime investigation maxim that the simplest  \n&gt;&gt; explanation is the most likely. Why should there be two groups?  \n&gt;&gt; Why not just one full of anarchists, loyal neither to black or  \n&gt;&gt; white? Most everything in this world falls into the area of gray.  \n&gt;&gt; I think it&#39;s therefore likely that this is true of the next.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\nAbsolu ely ue enough, W. :)A.On Aug 18, 2008, a 2:32 PM, black bea hollow w o e:Why 2 g oups... because he 2 desc ip ions o each g oup a e so adically di e en .
