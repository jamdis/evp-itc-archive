The resulting sound quality is better than\nthe Stretch function of CoolEdit/Audition.\n\nThe Expander website: http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/~tothl/expander.html\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Hi All, Have been doing sessions and sometimes get a voice or more that \n&gt; just jumps in and says a word or two durring the scan, but most of the \n&gt; time it seems it&#39;s like a room full of people talking very fast and \n&gt; thus I can&#39;t seem to hear them well enough to hear if they are giving \n&gt; me any messages! Am I the only one with this issue? How can I slow this \n&gt; down to hear better?   =Judy=   P.S. I only use the RS 12-469 with \n&gt; portable folding Craig speakers & a Sony cassette recorder with \n&gt; earphones (cups over ears). I sometimes use an external mic or just the \n&gt; cassette recorder&#39;s mic.\n\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links"}
