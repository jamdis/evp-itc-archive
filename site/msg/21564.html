:( You mean, I'm not an expert after only a few months of following your
w=
ork? Dammit! (LOL, just kiddin' around.)

I think it would really be great =
and helpful, at least to me, if someone
held an ITC/EVP summit where ONLY p=
eople who are interested in this
technology could get together and particip=
ate in round-table discussions
to share ideas, listen to each other's work =
(recordings, live
demonstrations), learn from The Masters in the field (lik=
e yourself!),
and come to some serious understandings. NO celebrity promoti=
ons, no
ghost investigations or ghost celebrities (no offense, anyone, but =
it's
not the place for it), no fund raising, no vendors, no competition for=

the spotlight, just talking and learning from each other and developing
re=
lationships. There's so much to learn and no one person knows it all
or can=
 share everything they know in a handful of postings on a Web
site. I think=
  real human interaction is what helps progress
understanding. People who a=
re serious about learning this stuff would
come to something like that, and=
 they would appreciate it for what it
is. I think you guys who create and u=
nderstand this technology have a
real responsibility to help others underst=
and it. It's the Spiderman
principle! "With great power comes great respons=
ibility." (Thanks, Uncle
Ben!)


I just feel like sometimes people in this =
field are too afraid to share
information because people will debunk them o=
r try to discredit them or
someone will "steal" their ideas (believe me, I'=
m no friggin' stranger
to having my ideas stolen! They don't want ME around=
, but the a**wipes
sure as hell LOVE my ideas!!). I really think that most =
people are more
accepting than that, though, and that it's time that seriou=
s researchers
who aren't in it for the fame come together and make some pro=
gress. I'd
be happy to volunteer to help organize such a thing.
