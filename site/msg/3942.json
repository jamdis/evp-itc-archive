Only three investigators were present in the room. \nTheir voices have been properly taken into account and ruled out as \nsources of the actual EVPs. \n\nThe new and resampled EVPs have been saved as .mp3 files. They can be \nfreely downloaded from the site here -\n\nhttp://www.filecrunch.com/user/orbhunterx\n\nYou will hear quite a few odd words, dog barks, and even mimicry. \nSome of the voices are faint and whispery. Other EVP voices sound \nlike the invisibles are standing right along side the researchers!\n\nSexual Content Warning:\n\nSeveral of the EVPs have strong sexual content. \n\nPlease read the file name prior to downloading.\n\nListening to the EVPs will be at your own disgression.\n\nThat stated, those that choose to listen to the EVPs, please let me \nknow if any of them need further contextual clarification. I look \nforward to hearing feedback. As it stands, the true nature of what&#39;s \ngoing on in the house awaits much more serious attention. \n\nSincerely,\nLance Oliver, Founder\nDenton Area Paranormal Society"}
