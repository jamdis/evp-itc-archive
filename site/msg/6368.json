I had to go to Radio Shack for a couple cables and saw it\nhanging next to the new 12-469&#39;s and grabbed it.  Brought it home and\nwas up and running in five minutes.  Next session will be with the 20-125.\n\nHad to stop my review of the audio because I had to share this.  I\nwill post anything else I find.  \n\nThe audio is straight from a mixer to the computer and recorded in\nAudacity.  I&#39;ve done no editing to the file except cut out this\nsnippet. Let me know what you think.\n\nJeremy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt;   File        : /Session 1 01_27_08 4pm please repeat name for\nme_MITCHELL_.wav \n&gt;   Uploaded by : ecuyler &lt;ecuyler@...&gt; \n&gt;   Description : 1_please repeat name_MITCHELL \n&gt; \n&gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt;\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Session%201%2001_27_08%204pm%20please%20repeat%20name%20for%20me_MITCHELL_.wav\n\n&gt; \n&gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt;\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; ecuyler &lt;ecuyler@...&gt;\n&gt;"}
