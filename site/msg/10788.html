<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s been my exopereince that alternative treatments may be more 
effective, such as Oil of Oregano. Heart burn might mean there&#x27;s a 
bateria in the stomach, but what do I know?

&gt; I will, I have had this since Monday, and my lady is the one 
pushing me to go. I&#x27;m a man (maybe a stupid man) and the only 
reason I would go to the Doctor is if I&#x27;m kicking the bucket. The 
only furneral I will go to is my own, and I&#x27;m not sure if I will 
even go to that one.lol I&#x27;ll be ok, and thanks for the concerns.
&gt; 
&gt; I also have acid reflux and it makes me miserable some times. I 
take a Zantac and it goes away. Thats just fine with me.

&gt; How could the breath air, their notsupposed tohave any lungs?
&gt; Who can tell what they have or don&#x27;t have. Hell my chest has been 
hurting for some reason and if it doesn&#x27;t get any better I might be 
talking to you from the other side. Time to go to the emergency 
room, but work comes first.
