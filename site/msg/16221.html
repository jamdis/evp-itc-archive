This one is also done with the RS 125 on AM, this first guy is saying,  
"tyger's cool" Tyger is one of my horse's he's a young stallion, this next one  
is a list of names, they sound like young guys, maybe they were killed in 
some  stupid war or they are part of some gang, or just my baseball football 
friends  that come here once and awhile to watch TV. part of the aka "the 
peanut gallery"  they usually bring the girl friends too. Used the RS 20-125  
AM for this  one too,  It sounds to me like they are using their own voices 
for this  too. sf
