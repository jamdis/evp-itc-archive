I think this kind of testing and study is part of the research, not some ra=
bid skeptic thing - I'm not even sure how you got from what seems to be a s=
imple study to the "rabid skeptic" anyway.=C2=A0 At lease not without more =
context, which is what I am asking for.

A link would be fine too. So far t=
hough, all we have is Frank's commentary on his selective quotations. If we=
're going to post these studies and comment on them, lets see the whole thi=
ng.

      Hi,



I'm not =
sure why we should give time or space in this forum to something like that.=
  After all, if their study is valid and published (or going to be), a link=
 will be sufficient for those who are interested.



I'm not interested. Ev=
en the excerpt, which seemed to pull out all the big words to dismiss the "=
science" of this, was a snooze.



I'm also not here to dissect the debunke=
rs and rabid skeptics. Really, what's the point?  No proof will be sufficie=
nt to meet their demands.  Let's just keep moving forward; momentum will se=
rve us better than stopping to analyze the follies of others.



I'm here t=
o learn about the results from work by Frank and others who are developing =
these devices.



While it was disappointing to hear that a study didn't fi=
nd merit in this approach to paranormal research and EVP, it was worth noti=
ng.



Having done so, I'd be a lot happier with more information about the=
 extreme experiments (the Ouija board idea tickled me) and where the "what =
if...?" questions lead people in this research.



Let those with less orig=
inality pontificate the meaning and validity of all this. They may yet prov=
ide something useful to this field. Or perhaps they won't.  



What matter=
s is the research. When it pauses or stops, the entire community loses.

Sincerely,

Fiona
