Robin,
 
I agree with Steve on a couple of points. First let me say that I=

do believe that we all have a "technician/guide/guardian" call them what y=
ou
may. but I usually call them by the names they introduced themselves by.=

 
I know for a fact through many, many, many box sessions that when I turn=

a box on, could be Frank's box or the minibox or the RS 470 does not matte=
r which.
 
The same two entities will come through immediately, So much so =
now, that I do not even ask for conformation that
it is in fact them. I rec=
ognise their individual voice patterns. I have built a solid relationship w=
ith these two spirits
I know as mike and Lisa so much so that I have even g=
otten to know their individual personalities.
 
There are other newer resea=
rchers here that will attest to the fact that when they where doing their f=
irst sessions
I had asked my two "Friends" Mike and Lisa to assist in getti=
ng them started and invariably the spirits that came 
through to these new =
researchers during their first sessions identified themselves as Mike and L=
isa.
 
Steve says he does not turn on his box and use them as a crutch, tha=
t is not entirely true. I had done research 
very closely with Steve until =
recently and I would venture to say that 99% if not every session he starts=
 with "Mike & Lisa
are you available to talk with me" 
 
Also I don't consi=
der working with my technicians as using them as a crutch, They would not a=
llow that.
They are not there like butlers at our beckoned call when we fee=
l they may be of some use.
Quite the opposite, without them we would get no=
 communication at all, they are allowing us the honor of receiving this 
ce=
lestial communication. They are the moderators, facilitators and generators=
 of all we hear and send to and from the spirit realm.
And they also stand =
as guards and protectors to do the best they can to keep us from being dece=
ived or taken down a dark path.
 
Some here wait for others to state an opi=
nion and then tend to agree with that opinion no matter what they have expe=
rienced to be true.
 
Robin, my advice to you as a new researcher in this f=
ield. Form your own beliefs through your experience and research.
Listen an=
d learn from others but do not let what you believe to be true or not, be s=
wayed by popular opinion.

 Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: File from tonight






Steve,
 
I certainly appreciate =
your thoughts.  In the back of my mind is always the question of whether we=
 are being Deceived.  Just for the sake of argument, is it POSSIBLE we're b=
eing manipulated by something evil?  I'm not frightened, and I won't stop m=
y own research (the negative stuff just makes me more determined), but my m=
ind does go there sometimes.  I hope that along with developing my "ear" I =
can acquire the gift of discernment.
 
Robin
