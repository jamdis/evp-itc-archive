I know you&#39;ll put it to good use a=\r\nnd be highly rewarded.  \n\nI&#39;m going to listen to my radios simultaneously r=\r\night now.. just listen with my eyes closed for a few minutes.  I tried doin=\r\ng this last night but promptly fell asleep!  I have my recorder with me too=\r\n but think I won&#39;t turn it on right now.  I wonder if it helps to ask quest=\r\nions BEFORE you actually start recording.  I used to do that when trying to=\r\n get regular ol&#39; EVP.\n\nRobin\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jules=\r\n&lt;mailto:ghostchasingfool@...&gt; \n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:E=\r\nVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n  Sent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 7:27 AM\n  Sub=\r\nject: [EVP-ITC] Frank&#39;s Box #12\n\n\n  I am proud to announce that yesterday I=\r\n became the bran new owner of \n  Franks Box #12. This box was past on from =\r\none researcher to another \n  and upon Bruce receiving his new Frank&#39;s Box #=\r\n29, he has willed the \n  box #12 to me for research. I have been longing fo=\r\nr a box for \n  several years now, and know that all good things come to tho=\r\nse who \n  wait.\n\n  I know this is an honor and a privilege being only the s=\r\necond women \n  in the world to own one (that I am aware of). I am extremely=\r\n greatful \n  to both Bruce and Frank as well as the others on this board an=\r\nd hope \n  that my contributions and sessions with this box can help in the =\r\n\n  field with our research!\n\n  The communication I got immediately when I t=\r\nurned it on is truly \n  amazing (I will be adding files shortly marked box =\r\n#12 in the file \n  section).\n\n  I have started doing two types of sessions =\r\none just running the \n  recorders (like Frank does) and then a separate que=\r\nstion and answer \n  session later during the day. I know its hard trying to=\r\n stop \n  yourself from asking questions, but let them have their time as we=\r\nll, \n  for the communication should not be one sided, us always wanting \n  =\r\nsomething from them to be answered. If they want you to jump in and \n  answ=\r\ner one of their questions, believe me they let you know (see my \n  file, le=\r\nts get started).\n\n  I have come to realize that many messages are missing w=\r\nhen you jump \n  the gun trying to start that immediate two way communicatio=\r\nn, or you \n  start talking over them, not allowing clear audio to be receiv=\r\ned. \n  Therefore, I would highly suggest trying this as well, you just may =\r\n\n  be surpised what you get!\n\n  Additionally, I have also observed that whe=\r\nn tuning in the boxes, \n  play close attention,they may just give you direc=\r\ntions, you don&#39;t \n  have to have the conversation going. They seem to want =\r\nthat \n  communication just as bad as you do.\n\n  It is audio clips with grea=\r\nt communication that make all of this \n  time worth it. Knowing that in my =\r\nheart they enjoy communicating with \n  us just as much as we do them.\n\n  Ju=\r\nli\n\n\n\n   \r\n------=_NextPart_000_191B_01C8796D.9CEE2CB0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3Dtext/html;charset=3Diso-8859-1&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16609&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY id=\r\n=3DMailContainerBody \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 10px; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FON=\r\nT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #000000; BORDER-TOP-STYLE: none; PADDING-TOP: 15px; FO=\r\nNT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; BORDER-RIGHT-STYLE: none; BORDER-LE=\r\nFT-STYLE: none; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; TEXT-DECORATION: none; BORDER-BO=\r\nTTOM-STYLE: none&quot; \nleftMargin=3D0 topMargin=3D0 acc_role=3D&quot;text&quot; CanvasTab=\r\nStop=3D&quot;true&quot; \nname=3D&quot;Compose message area&quot;&gt;&lt;!--[gte IE 5]&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace=\r\n prefix=3D&quot;v&quot; /&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix=3D&quot;o&quot; /&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Hi J=\r\nuli, &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Congratulations on the box!!&nbsp; I kno=\r\nw you&#39;ll put it to good use and be \nhighly rewarded.&nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I&#39;m going to listen to my radios simultaneously right now.. j=\r\nust listen \nwith my eyes closed for a few minutes.&nbsp; I tried doing this=\r\n last night but \npromptly fell asleep!&nbsp; I have my recorder with me too=\r\n but think I won&#39;t \nturn it on right now.&nbsp; I wonder if it helps to ask=\r\n questions BEFORE you \nactually start recording.&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to do th=\r\nat when trying to get \nregular ol&#39; EVP.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Robin&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-L=\r\nEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2px solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0=\r\npx&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A \n  title=3Dmailto:ghostch=\r\nasingfool@... \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:ghostchasingfool@...&quot;&gt;Jules&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A \n  title=3Dmailto:E=\r\nVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@y=\r\nahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; We=\r\ndnesday, February 27, 2008 7:27 \n  AM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt aria=\r\nl&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; [EVP-ITC] Frank&#39;s Box #12&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV=\r\n id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n  &lt;P&gt;I am proud to announce that yesterday I became the br=\r\nan new owner of \n  &lt;BR&gt;Franks Box #12.
