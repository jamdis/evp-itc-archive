<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>If 30 people listen to your EVP recording and they all (100%) hear  
exactly what you do, are they wrong? Matrixing perhaps? Are they  
coincidentally all &quot;interpreting&quot; what they hear? Does that make the  
recording real? Just a coincidence?

If we all sit in a theater and watch the same movie, we might like it  
or not, form 100&#x27;s of different opinions about the movie, but the  
movie is still real.

No matter what we do as researchers, there will always be someone to  
attempt to say what we do isn&#x27;t real.

I&#x27;ve seen people experience paranormal activity, objects move and 5  
other people besides them witness the same thing, the exact same  
thing, only later to hear them later make excuses for what they saw.  
So no matter what proof we present, there&#x27;s always someone around to  
poo poo it - usually a person who has never actually researched EVP/ 
ITC themselves ever.
