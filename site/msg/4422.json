Good to know, as I am \nperfomring an operation in the next day or so on mine. - LC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Everytime I open the &#39;470 the battery wire breaks off. \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So dummy here couldn&#39;t even follow Mike&#39;s great video \ninstructions \n&gt; with the RS12-469.  After driving two hours to Merida, Mexico and \n&gt; then back and putting down 600 pesos (about $55 dollars) it took me \n&gt; ten minutes to do everything UFO Geek laid out in his video for \n&gt; hacking the radio shack box.  Cut the right pin labeled mute.  \nClosed \n&gt; the box nicely.  Nothing.  Reopened the box...looked around...two \n&gt; times more...still nothing.   Not even a light or hum.  \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   Until I figure the radio thing out, I am in the mean time \ngetting \n&gt; nowhere (it seems) with the EVP Maker on my computer to generate \nEVP \n&gt; noise and using my hand recorder etc.   Wish I could try the radio \n&gt; sistem...any real geeks who can give technical suggestions would be \n&gt; greatly appreciated.  Or maybe I should just throw away my 469 and \n&gt; start over.   Dont think RS will take it back.     geek-wanna-be, \nRon \n&gt; L\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Never miss a thing.
