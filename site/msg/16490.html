&gt;  So who certified these &quot;objective&quot; listeners in these supposed tests?
&gt; Everyone hears different, and I doubt having some degree means you get
&gt; perfect hearing. Even everyday stuff like music lyrics, everyone hears
&gt; different, why aren&#x27;t these skeptics out there keeping people from buying
&gt; records?
&gt; 
&gt;  That&#x27;s pure BS about trying to save people from wasting money and time. I
&gt; don&#x27;t know what the motivation is, but I suspect it has more to do with
&gt; science dogma, than pure science. It&#x27;s like we are all supposed to to get
&gt; some bozo&#x27;s permission to do our investigations, and research has to be
&gt; approved by some university. I say bite me!
&gt; 
&gt;  I dared to question the motivation and methods of these supposed objective
&gt; scientists and was accused of attacking them, like how dare I even question
&gt; their authority! I&#x27;m supposed to supply my equipment for debunking and not
&gt; even ask how it will  be tested, or what qualifies these bozos to test
&gt; anything?
&gt; 
&gt;  I&#x27;ve said all along that you can&#x27;t take everything from the boxes as
&gt; gospel, and you do in fact hear what you want to hear at times, but these
&gt; pompus jerks act like I&#x27;m the one out there fooling everyone.  These science
&gt; dorks want one thing, they want the boxes to go away because it does in fact
&gt; show that there is more to life than the physical and we are in fact more
&gt; that some stupid accident as they would have us believe. There is very
&gt; strong motivation for science to show the box is nothing, as with all things
&gt; paranormal.
&gt; 
&gt;  Why is is ok for them to lie in the name of science!?  When they say &quot;there
&gt; is no evidence&quot; that is a lie!
