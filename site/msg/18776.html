<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was able to finally figure out how to take pieces of the files and change to MP3 format etc. The one file was at a place my husband worked at within the military so dying in combat was not a strange response.
Second was I was hurting holding something and passed it off to my husband and the &quot;sooo&quot; I feel is the one man being funny  because earlier in the EVP session I had said it hurt too but kept going through holding the dowsing rods. :o)

Please let me know what you all think!</pre>
