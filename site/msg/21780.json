Jesus could not  have called anyone into the light because he never existed. Leave amy winehouse alone, she is not related to you and not your concern.

Which \n&gt; says, &quot;Amy, she just got in,  and she cried&quot; &quot; a pretty girl&quot; &quot;crossing \n&gt; over she cried, Jesus want her to  cross.&quot;  And the other says,  &quot;Amy, somebody \n&gt; loves you.&quot;  She  must have died feeling unloved.   sf\n&gt;"}
