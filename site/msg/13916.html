WHO: Mexico swine flu has 'pandemic potential'

Associated Press, Apri=
l 25, 2009

GENEVA - The head of the World Health Organization says the swi=
ne flu outbreak in Mexico and the United States could develop into a pandem=
ic.

WHO Director-General Margaret Chan says the outbreak involves "an anim=
al strain of the H1N1 virus, and it has pandemic potential."

Chan says it =
is too early to say whether a pandemic will actually occur.

The global hea=
lth body has advised countries around the world to look out for similar out=
breaks following the discovery of related strains on both sides of the Mexi=
co-U.S. border.

At least 62 people in Mexico have died from pneumonia afte=
r contracting a flu-like virus. WHO says some tested positive for a strain =
that sickened at least seven in the southwestern U.S. No deaths have been r=
eported in the U.S.

WHO Calls Emergency Meeting

Associated Press, April 2=
4, 2009

GENEVA - The World Health Organization has called an emergency mee=
ting of experts Saturday to consider declaring an international public heal=
th emergency over the swine flu outbreak believed to have killed dozens of =
people in Mexico and sickened at least seven in the U.S.

It is the first t=
ime the WHO's Director-General Margaret Chan has convened such a crisis pan=
el since the procedure was created almost two years ago, spokesman Gregory =
Hartl said.

The committee may decide Saturday that the outbreak constitute=
s a public health emergency, and if so, whether WHO should consider measure=
s including travel advisories, trade restrictions and border closures.

The=
 global body's flu pandemic alert level is now set to phase three - meaning=
 there is no or very limited risk of a new virus spreading from human to hu=
man.

The committee "will be asked, 'should we raise the alert level to pha=
se four or phase five,' depending on their appreciation of how far the viru=
s has spread," Hartl said.

An increased alert level was considered likely,=
 as initial evidence from the outbreak in Mexico indicates the virus has sp=
read between people. Hartl said, however, that a decision would not be made=
 Saturday.

At least 62 people have died from severe pneumonia caused by a =
flu-like illness in Mexico, according to WHO. Some of those who died are co=
nfirmed to have contracted a type of swine flu known as A/H1N1. That partic=
ular flu variant has not previously been seen in pigs or humans, though oth=
er types of H1N1 have.

"This is a very high concern for us as the world's =
global health organization," Hartl said.

The current seasonal flu vaccine =
is not believed to offer any protection against this new swine flu. But ant=
i-viral drug Tamiflu appears to be fully effective against the H1N1 virus, =
and "Mexico and the United States already have large stocks of Tamiflu," Ha=
rtl said.

The virus has caused alarm in Mexico, where more than 1,000 peop=
le have been sickened. Authorities there have closed schools, museums, libr=
aries and theaters in a bid to contain the outbreak.

WHO, which has been m=
onitoring the situation since Thursday, said 12 of the Mexican cases have b=
een confirmed as genetically identical to a swine flu virus detected in Cal=
ifornia.

U.S. authorities said seven people were infected with swine flu i=
n California and Texas, and all recovered.

"We do seem to have found incid=
ents of the same illness, which is swine influenza A/H1N1, on both sides of=
 the border in various locations," Hartl said.

WHO has sent experts to Mex=
ico to monitor the situation there, and asked countries to report any unusu=
al flu outbreaks.

"We are at the beginning of the outbreak here, and there=
 are a lot of things that we still don't know," Hartl said.

"We're not sur=
e exactly of the transmission routes, where the initial infection came from=
, how efficient it is in transmitting," he said. WHO is also questioning "w=
hy no one has died in the United States so far whereas there have been conf=
irmed deaths in Mexico."

WHO chief Chan broke off a visit to Washington, w=
here she was to meet with U.S. officials, to oversee WHO's response to the =
crisis from its Strategic Health Operation Center in Switzerland.

The viru=
s appears to cause flu-like symptoms that can develop into severe pneumonia=
, Hartl said, urging anyone to visit a doctor if they had been to affected =
areas and were feeling symptoms.

"You would want to take the same kind of =
precautions that you would do with pneumonia and an influenza-like illness,=
" he said.
