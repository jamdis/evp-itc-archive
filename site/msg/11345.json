Any other ideas regarding crystal radio anyone.\n&gt;\nRay,\n\nI have recently built a Raudive detector into a metal 1/8 inch phone\njack for a friend, using surface mount coil and 1/8 watt resistor with\na regular crystal diode. This is basically an untuned crystal radio\nand detects all radio signals at the same time.\n\nI didn&#39;t get anything but noise for the short time I had it...but my\nfriend is happy.\n\nJoe"}
