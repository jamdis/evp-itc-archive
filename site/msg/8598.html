<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce,

&gt; My belief is it&#x27;s actually easier for them than using a box to
&gt; communicate, for the simple reason that the EVPM allaphone device
&gt; gives them a steady and more or less predictable tone value to work
&gt; with. they can not of course incorporate speech nuances or specific
&gt; accents or phonetic variations, as with the boxes but i believe that
&gt; is due to box communication being formed by fragments of human voice
&gt; that are being received through radio signal. EVPM is a tonal signal
&gt; that is generated by a constricted program and does not nearly allow
&gt; the range of nuances that a box signal does.

Yes, this sounds plausible. There are only 72 allophones they can use.
Perhaps this is easier than trying to use unpredictable radio fragments.
