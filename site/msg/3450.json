I think male tones are mo=\r\nre easily heard in general for most people I share with on the h2o sessions=\r\n. As for the other methods, again it depends on what we can hear, what equi=\r\npment we are using, what speakers are used to play them etcetera. For my ea=\r\nrs?..yes most definitely! Most of them are for our ears in tone and frequen=\r\ncy we can process. \n\n  Better luck next time!

Thier voices always sounded =\r\nlike a tv playing in the other room but there would be no television on and=\r\n no man and woman visible.\n\n      When I moved some of the strangeness foll=\r\nowed tho I never heard her voice again until I returned to that old house. =\r\nOnce I left again I didnt hear it again until I happened to start capturing=\r\n thier speech in evp research. Once I realized I was able to do this and pu=\r\nmp up the volume, replay etcetera her voice returned. Only this time I ofte=\r\nn hear her clearly thanks to technology being what it is.\n\n      For the lo=\r\nngest time I had no clue who she was just that now and then I would hear &quot;t=\r\nhat womans&quot; voice pop up in my evp. Also when I started doing this research=\r\n many spirits spoke of a woman named Rachel. Visiting Rachel&#39;s house, talki=\r\nng about her like she was an angel or a guide or even thier grandmother. On=\r\ne day i decided to ask a simple question. What was the name of the woman wh=\r\no was speaking, and the reply I got quite stunned me. It was &quot;her&quot; voice sa=\r\nying the name Rachel. In some weird way it made some sort of crazy sense. A=\r\nll this time this spirit has been around me and I dont have the foggiest id=\r\nea who she is just that for some reason she has an interest in hanging arou=\r\nnd me for over 30 years now. I never saw her as a negative just slightly an=\r\nnoying and maybe a bit spooky as a kid hehehe\n\n      On one hand it was qui=\r\nte disturbing growing up with that...on the other its quite comforting to m=\r\ne now to have placed some details on that &quot;figment of my imagination&quot; I was=\r\n forced to live with. Shined a bit of light on the subject for me quite lit=\r\nerally. \n\n      Anyways a short while back it occurred to me that I should =\r\nstart collecting her files together in one collection so I started to do th=\r\nat. When I run across them in my archives I copy them over or when I record=\r\n a new one I will copy it over. I plan to do the same for Otto...he has qui=\r\nte a number of files tho he rarely speaks the others are always quick to fi=\r\nll in details of what hes doing. \n\n      Anyway check it out when you get a=\r\n chance. I think if you can hear the evp at all that in quite a few you may=\r\n hear the similarity in her voice, her way of speaking, and her tone. I don=\r\nt expect you to hear all of it but I think most will hear quite a few of th=\r\nem.\n\n      Enjoy\n      http://www.esnips.com/web/RachelFiles\n\n      http://=\r\nwww.esnips.com/user/MistyDawn if link above gives problems\n\n      Misty\n\n--=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  =\r\n    Never miss a thing.
