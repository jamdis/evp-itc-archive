<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>thanks for taking the trouble to look, Bill.

i have a yahoo messenger webcam set up for members of franks-evp only 
for better explanatios/demonstrations.  if anyone wants an evp 
competent  (or wtf) 1n34 to plug into their tape machine AND is a 
member of this group only , i&#x27;ll send them out as long as i can 
afford it/can spare time.  worth the effort IMO for patient detail 
conscious researchers which evp-ers seem to be.  the described 
procedure should work on first or second try for those that can put 
together crystal receiver and plug it into amplifier.--with smal cap 
to ground plug, you could even do it with a tape recorder.  all long 
wires that can act as antennas can then be removed and only diode or 
diode and tuned circuit employed.  whole assembly can be rotated to 
block out radio stations.

&gt; &gt; fooling around with thunder:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; we&#x27;re getting those drenching t-storms with the low lightning 
between 
&gt; &gt; the trees , typical of jupiter passing between earth and galactic 
&gt; &gt; center so april 6 should be best evp time in awhile
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; tonite:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; heated anode gold whisker end with one match .  in live circuit 
tuned 
&gt; &gt; to strong local station.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; when match was two thirds burned, white noise started. match was 
put 
&gt; &gt; out. 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; now there is a steady 20mv* across input with diode in place.  
&gt; &gt; previously 0 mv.  no difference when diode is reversed..  diode 
&gt; &gt; removed, v drops to zero.  formerly strong local station was 
barely 
&gt; &gt; audible with good audio amp.  now it is  at normal listening 
volume.  
&gt; &gt; diode is noisy, but beneath what you can hear when tuned to 
&gt; &gt; station.  &quot;lumpy&quot; white noise; white noise with larger scale 
order 
&gt; &gt; appearing and vanishing- unpredictably , like candle flame- but 
&gt; &gt; averaging about 3-15 times per second
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; other am receivers still full of crashing static from long gone t-
&gt; &gt; storm.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; tank circuit +diode + audio amp= no lightning crashes 
whatsoever.  no 
&gt; &gt; line noise. no fluorescent light 60hz buzz.

&gt; &gt; im making som noise sources as soon as i collapse for awhile by 
&gt; &gt; holding a soldering iron to either end of  1n34 diode in live 
&gt; &gt; circuit.  injection of gold from point contact into germanium 
block 
&gt; &gt; forms defect type dopant and microscopic p or n+ later junction 
which 
&gt; &gt; has low back threshold and is very noisy but low amplitude.  
noise 
&gt; &gt; that issues from an infinitely smal point source seems to work 
better 
&gt; &gt; for some reason.   i just hold a match or soldering on there 
while 
&gt; &gt; listening to amplified noise till i get something that sounds good
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; * 20mv average,  larger scale prigogine fluctuations up to 75mv.  
&gt; &gt; unpredictable but not completely random--pinked up due to 
SOMETHING 
&gt; &gt; UNIDENTIFIED trying to cohere. amplified 3-15 per second voltage 
&gt; &gt; peaks drive sweep.  random except for voice or other coherent 
energy.
