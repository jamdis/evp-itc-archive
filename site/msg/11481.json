I&#39;m \nnot sure it would work any better than a solid state tuner though. You \ncan even replace the tunning capacitor in a portable radio with \nvaractors. There&#39;s lots of room for variations. \n\n I have the sweep circuits on PCB, using ExpressPCB&#39;s mini boards. 3 \nboards=$60. The voices I just posted were done with the PCBs and a car \ntuner. Components are marked on the silk screen, although there is no \nsilk screen on the boards themselves after they are manufacured. The \nboards are designed to be used with a varity of tuners. There is a few \nsurface mount components in the mic bias circuit, and tone control, but \nas with these latest voices, I was not using those, and they could be \nleft off if need be. \n\n Frank-S\n\n \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;windsymph&quot; &lt;arrius@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  I am in search of a few answers pertaining to Franks Box. Can anyone \n&gt; direct me to a schematic inclusive of instructions as to the design \nof \n&gt; a Franks Box. Secondly I as to the am band units, can they only be \n&gt; devised and constrcuted with transistor circuits only or can the \n&gt; technique be applied to older tube sets as well?? I ask only because \nI \n&gt; would like to test some theories and thoughts. My sincere thanks to \nall \n&gt; for your time and replies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Arrius\n&gt;"}
