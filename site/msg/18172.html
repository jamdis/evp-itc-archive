<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I chose the chair to help control for &#x27;educated guesses&#x27;: since after the second experiment, everyone knew the shape of the monitor, an educated guesser might try to hear results that would be reasonable for what they already knew.

Just FYI: I am not beyond balancing a canoe on it if I thought it would be in the name of science :-)

&gt; &gt;&gt;    What it is RJ, is there are too many people talking all at once on
&gt; &gt;&gt; this, and not only that but, there is also the reverse side, they can start
&gt; &gt;&gt; something on one side, and carry on with the reverse side, it is usually
&gt; &gt;&gt; where the voice left off, so one must go back to where it was heard, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; reverse it.  I don&#x27;t think spirit is omnipresent, they are not God or Holy
&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirit, maybe they can&#x27;t see everywhere, but only make guesses, like most
&gt; &gt;&gt; people do, unless they have some necessary information to give, like the
&gt; &gt;&gt; ones with the info. on the missing girl last year.  So, I don&#x27;t know what to
&gt; &gt;&gt; tell you, maybe, they don&#x27;t know where you live etc..sf

&gt; &gt;&gt;  So far, your claims that this is not possible are holding true.

&gt; &gt;&gt;   DAH! again. There&#x27;s way to much expectation created in trying to guess,
&gt; &gt;&gt; so participants minds interfere with whatever spirit communication there
&gt; &gt;&gt; might be. You do not understand how this communcations works, nor do you
&gt; &gt;&gt; understand the effects of the observer, you can not seperate the observer
&gt; &gt;&gt; from the event in the pararnormal.  therefore any results are
&gt; &gt;&gt; invalid--before you go puffing your chest out thinking how clever you are in
&gt; &gt;&gt; debunking spirit communication. Even your own expectation that no valid
&gt; &gt;&gt; information will be received is enough to block all information. But as
&gt; &gt;&gt; usual, skeptic/debunker ignore all!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  Thanks to everyone who participated in Experiment 2.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; On Friday, 7/16/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer monitor,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; right in front of me, and left it there until noon Denver time on Monday,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 7/19/2010. This experiment asked for participants to determine what that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; object was. Vague or partial answers would not be counted (for example, just
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; giving a color, shape, size, what it&#x27;s made of, etc): we&#x27;re looking for what
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#x27;t count.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; they chose.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the object at the start
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; group. The idea with this file is that you could download it at the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; beginning of the experiment and &#x27;keep it safe&#x27; on your computer. Then at the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; end of the experiment, I would post the password so you can reveal the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; contents of the file. That way, you were in control of the original image
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; during the entire time, not me.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Passworded pdf: http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; RJ/RJ20100716. pdf&lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.pdf&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The password for that file is: 2plus2isFour
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Instructions, if you need them for the other files, are also in that RJ
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; folder.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So to the results:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Number of participants: 6
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Total tries: 29
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Ambiguous answers: 0
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Correct answers: 0
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Object: Chair
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Object picture: http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; RJ/RJ20100716. jpg&lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.jpg&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; As a little side experiment, on Monday I also asked if anyone had gotten
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; any answers that might indicate an article of clothing (though I did not say
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; why I was asking). One theory is that the human operator can be influenced
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; by things they already know or suspect, and so interpret audio with their
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; own personal &#x27;educated guesses&#x27;, that would differ from what they would hear
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; had they not known those things. This side experiment did indicate some
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; support for that theory, since before I mentioned &#x27;articles of clothing&#x27;, no
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; one included an article of clothing in their results. But after I mentioned
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; it, several reports of clothing began to appear. I did not add these tries
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to the results above.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; me know. Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this experiment.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
