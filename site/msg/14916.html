&gt;  Maybe, some can also check on the poor folks on that plane that went

&gt;  It wasn&#x27;t suicide, it was accidental:
&gt;
&gt; *Carradine Death Was Accidental
&gt; *
&gt; IMDb, June 4, 2009
&gt;
&gt; David Carradine died during a sex game that went wrong, according to
&gt; sources in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was found dead on Thursday.
&gt;
&gt; Carradine&#x27;s body was discovered in a hotel suite and local reports
&gt; suggested he committed suicide.
&gt;
&gt; He was discovered by a maid, naked and hanged, but the suggestions his
&gt; death had a sexual twist were strongly disputed by the star&#x27;s close friend,
&gt; attorney Vicki Roberts, and his manager Chuck Binder, who insisted he died
&gt; of natural causes.
&gt;
&gt; But a statement from Carradine&#x27;s representative now indicates the actor
&gt; died during a sex act.
&gt;
&gt; The spokesperson tells TMZ.com, &quot;We can confirm 100 percent that he never
&gt; would have committed suicide. It was an accidental death. Everybody is in
&gt; shock.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Rumours Carradine died attempting auto-erotic asphyxiation--where victims
&gt; achieve heightened sexual pleasure by restricting their air supply are
&gt; backed up by a quote a Bangkok police officer gave to British newspaper The
&gt; Sun.
&gt;
&gt; The cop tells reporters, &quot;A rope was attached to his neck and also to his
&gt; penis&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Rocker Michael Hutchence was rumoured to have died attempting the same sex
&gt; act in a Sydney, Australia, hotel room back in 1997--although his death was
&gt; officially declared a suicide.
&gt;
&gt; Carradine was in Thailand to shoot the movie &quot;Stretch.&quot; He was 72.

&gt;  The spirit world to talk with David Carradine,  to see what happened, if
&gt; someone may have killed him, it&#x27;s hard to believe that he would take his own
&gt; life, I feel like it was foul play. sf
