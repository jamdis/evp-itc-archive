I didn&#x27;t say that. I said there are hundreds of examples on line of  
known long exposures. When even a few of these are compared with  
Luminator examples, I see a tremendous similarity. Do you?


&gt; but there are a couple of dozen in Macy&#x27;s book, &quot;Spirit Faces,&quot; and  
&gt; yes, many many of them are open to wide interpretation,

Does that mean that you agree with my point? Because, as I reason  
it,  they are either spirit extras or they aren&#x27;t. They can&#x27;t sort-of  
be spirit extras. I&#x27;m not sure what other interpretations there might  
be in this instance.


&gt; just as our humble recordings are.

&gt;   In addition to that majority that make us say, &quot;Come on!{&quot; there  
&gt; are a handful that make you say &quot;Hmmmmmmm. . . .&quot; Just like we  
&gt; offer a handful of results from our endless recording efforts to  
&gt; try to convince the hard-nosed.

I&#x27;d agree with you wholeheartedly, if I had ever seen one that did,  
in fact, make me go, &quot;Hmmmm.&quot; As I said, I have never seen one where  
the sitter and the extra did not share a consistent set of features  
and coloring. If you have any examples that do, and you can share  
them, I&#x27;d be delighted to see them. I&#x27;d like my opinion to be swayed.  
Really, I would.

&gt; I would think that many would see the Luminator efforts as a modern  
&gt; effort at scrying.

Do you mean scrying as in the psychomanteum method developed by  
Raymond Moody? My understanding, from attending a presentation by Dr.  
Moody, was that the psychomanteum produced full-blown apparitions  
that could converse with the bereaved. Not sure these two types of  
events are comparable.

&gt; Everything we do crosses boundaries, and my point is that it&#x27;s  
&gt; really hard to walk the line between trying to be scientific and  
&gt; trying to be open.  It&#x27;s really, really hard! But if we give in one  
&gt; area, we have to be willing to give in another.

I don&#x27;t think that is arguably true, Ursula. If the evidence appears  
good, I acknowledge it; if the evidence appears weak, I acknowledge  
it. It is simply not true to say that a person cannot be both open- 
minded and scientific. I really do want to believe, but I won&#x27;t  
believe just because I want to. And because you, me, or anyone  
&quot;gives&quot; in one area, does not make a phenomenon any more or less real.

Your fellow traveler on this journey,

Ann

&gt; This is a classic example of the kind of photo that Mark thinks shows
&gt; a spirit extra. To me, clearly, this is the same woman--same hair,
&gt; same eyes, same mouth, same nose. Again, to me, it looks like a
&gt; classic long exposure when compared with other known long exposures--
&gt; I&#x27;ve included just of hundreds of examples.
