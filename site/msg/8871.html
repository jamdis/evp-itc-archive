<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Stefan.  I&#x27;m thinking too much has been cut from this one.  Ran a couple sessions with 
it.  I&#x27;m not getting anything (not that I get something every time with the other 72- but 
nothing sounds even remotely like word formation with the 56 file.)

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that
&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC 
&gt; group.
&gt; 
&gt;   File        : /Stefan/SJ-Allophones_without_diphthongs.wav 
&gt;   Uploaded by : evpfan &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; 
&gt;   Description : The same SpeakJet allophones, but without the 16 diphthongs which 
sound like one-syllable words as &quot;I&quot;, &quot;ear&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;air&quot;, etc. (so this file contains only 56 
allophones, which might be too less). 
&gt; 
&gt; You can access this file at the URL:
