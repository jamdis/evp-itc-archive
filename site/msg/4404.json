I&#39;ll let you know after.\n  Just to throw in regarding EVP maker and everything else but the boxes.  I used EVP maker and the water method AND foreign language broadcast method and radio static and box fan, etc etc etc before I got my shack hack and my Joe&#39;s box, and I must admit that I have put everything else aside even though I got good results with ALL of those other methods.  There&#39;s just something very exciting about the boxes, I think, that makes us forsake all others.  When I started using a hack, which Jeff Rezman made for me before I got the Joe&#39;s Box, I felt it was a nervous sort of experimentation--that is to say, the loud, short, fast sound clips had me on edge, as I was used to quiet static and water, but I think now I&#39;m addicted to the sound and the frenzy of it!  Does anyone else feel this way?\n  Ursula\n\nbillliscomb williscomb@... wrote:\n          Ursula and Misty � thank you very much for your feedback.

Interesting. \nFrank S. - Thanks for the recent files from EVPmaker - nice! \nThere hasn&#39;t been much discussion regarding EVPmaker lately, so I \nwasn&#39;t&#39; sure if it was a viable tool to use. I haven&#39;t read many \nolder posts, but hope to get caught up during the holidays. Have you \nor others considered modifying speech synthesis software to generate \nrandom sounds? I wonder how something like that would work�\nOn the 16th I did three 3minute recordings and got 9 clips from \nthem. In this session, I was asking questions regarding a knocking \nsound I heard while going to sleep or waking up about 12 years ago. \nMy life situation wasn&#39;t the best at that time. It was always three \nknocks, and once a doorbell, but not the doorbell for where I was \nthen living. Started the Knocking session by telling &quot;Rick&quot; that I \ngot messages from previous session, got &quot;Well, he&#39;s got patience!&quot; \nfor response. Then was told, &quot;Aye, it smells in here.&quot; Next asked \nthem what sound did I hear back then, and got &quot;it was knocking (maybe \nnothing?)&quot; The best one so far is; &quot;Our earthbound forefathers are \nvideo programs.&quot; A second voice keeps repeating &quot;Ent&quot; syllable \nduring this one. I have put these files in a new folder called \nKnocking, which is under Laptop MP3s. More comments there. \nI&#39;m making progress on getting the software needed to do \nlinear scanning with the Radio Shark 2 USB am/fm radio and hope to \nhave it up and running within the next week or two. \nThanks again to all\nWilly \n\n\n\n                         \n\r\n--0-305959572-1198105917=:72786\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Willy, Really interested in listening to the new files.&nbsp; I&#39;ll let you know after.&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Just to throw in regarding EVP maker and everything else but the boxes.&nbsp; I used EVP maker and the water method AND foreign language broadcast method and radio static and box fan, etc etc etc before I got my shack hack and my Joe&#39;s box, and I must admit that I have put everything else aside even though I got good results with ALL of those other methods.&nbsp; There&#39;s just something very exciting about the boxes, I think, that makes us forsake all others.&nbsp; When I started using a hack, which Jeff Rezman made for me before I got the Joe&#39;s Box, I felt it was a nervous sort of experimentation--that is to say, the loud, short, fast sound clips had me on edge, as I was used to quiet static and water, but I think now I&#39;m addicted to the sound and the frenzy of it!&nbsp; Does anyone else feel this way?&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Ursula&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;billliscomb &lt;A\n href=&quot;mailto:williscomb@...&quot;&gt;williscomb@...&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE class=replbq style=&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid&quot;&gt;  &lt;DIV id=ygrp-text&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Ursula and Misty � thank you very much for your feedback.
