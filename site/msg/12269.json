There is much \nhere, but what I found that the details about the 1960&#39;s research \nusing mediums was listed under the Spiricom section, discussing the \nSpiricom Mark I, II, III, and IV.  I&#39;m still searching and reading \nfrom this site as it is full of interesting data.\n\nhttp://www.worlditc.org/\n\nI even did a Blog Talk radio show about the 1960&#39;s group last year.\nMy BTR shows are located here, and it&#39;s one of the archived shows:\n\nhttp://www.blogtalkradio.com/ufogeek\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;threadsintyme@...&quot; \n&lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike,\n&gt; WONDFERFUL that you know some mediums...hopefully they may even be \nable to help you.\n&gt; I was wondering Mike, are there ajny web sites that speak of this \ntesting and research in the 1960&#39;s? \n&gt; Al\n&gt; \n&gt; -- &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Al,\n&gt; \n&gt; - The results as written, were very good. Actual conversations were \n&gt; documented, and even help provided on ways to better contact and \n&gt; interface with the spirits, given by the spirits themselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; - I don&#39;t know about specs on the Ion Lamp. I just wanted to try it \n&gt; since it is active light frequency that changes or is manipulated \n&gt; very easily.\n&gt; \n&gt; - I&#39;ll keep your ideas in mind when I do my next set.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Thanks for the advice about finding mediums. I know a few and \nwill \n&gt; probably talk with them since I am already friends with each of \nthem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;threadsintyme@&quot; \n&gt; &lt;Threadsintyme@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mike,\n&gt; &gt; What were the results of working the mediums? Anything \nsignificant? \n&gt; &gt; Kinda wish we both lived a bit closer, we might have been able to \n&gt; work together on some projects... :D We live in Michigan. \n&gt; &gt; Al\n&gt; Mike, Is there any research that says that an ion lamp is hyper \n&gt; sensitive? \n&gt; \n&gt; You might wish to hookup your EMF detectors in such a fashion that \n&gt; each one showing a response would be video taped. If one has a \n&gt; positive, then it might show up on your video.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, if you are interested in locating a medium, look in your \nlocal \n&gt; phone book for a local spiritualist church. They will have many \n&gt; mediums attending. Before you ask to test them, please, build up a \n&gt; friendship first. I was recently asked to be tested by some locals \n&gt; but their proposal was very poorly written and had no real tests or \n&gt; conclusions, per se. I turned them down. \n&gt; \n&gt; Al\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Funny you should mention using a medium to communicate with this \n&gt; &gt; system. That dediated group in the 1960&#39;s first used mediums in \n&gt; &gt; conjunction with their electronic equipment.\n&gt; &gt; The mediums were used to relay the words or feelings they heard \nor \n&gt; &gt; felt from the spirits that were attracted to the different modes \nof \n&gt; &gt; frequencies that the experimentors.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m in Colorado Springs, Colorado; in the same neighborhood where \n&gt; &gt; Nikola Tesla did his experiments while in this city for about 6-8 \n&gt; &gt; months. His lab was located about a 3 minute drive from my house.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;threadsintyme@&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;Threadsintyme@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have an idea for you to think about and possibly consider \n&gt; &gt; trying. mediums, as you know are about a dime per dozen these \ndays. \n&gt; &gt; Have you considered video taping a medium before, during and \nafter \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; reading was being done? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once while some of our smaller group in Muskegon, MI were out \n&gt; ghost \n&gt; &gt; hunting one afternoon, I sensed a spirit nearby and asked some of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; members to use their EMF equipment to see if they could pickup \n&gt; &gt; anything. One guy had a positive reaction to a spirit that was \n&gt; &gt; standing in front of me. His EMF detector showed a few blips and \n&gt; then \n&gt; &gt; the spirit was gone. I was still communicating with the spirit \n&gt; after \n&gt; &gt; the blimps stopped. Might be worth trying as an experiment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike, where are you located?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Al\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -- &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Al,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To answer your first question I provide this link:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S-4e-wxd6U\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s a video that better explains how I think it might work. \n&gt; (Just \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; couple of possibilites).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To answer your second question... I have done three \n&gt; experimentation \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sessions so far, and the results differ. In one I got no \n&gt; response, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and in the other two I did get action but I&#39;m unsure on what \n&gt; caused \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it. I&#39;m reviewing it further.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My use of the Ion lamp, which is away from the \ntraditional &#39;video-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; loop&#39; method is based on things I&#39;ve read from those who were \n&gt; into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this EVP/ITC thing way before us. Back in the 1960&#39;s there was \n&gt; much \n&gt; &gt; &gt; experimentation going on that involved a varied range of \n&gt; &gt; frequencies, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; including light frequencies. Even house plants were considered \n&gt; into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the EVP/ITC equation (Maybe I&#39;ll try that next).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My use of the Ion lamp goes along with a continued desire to \n&gt; &gt; further \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the work of the dedicated group from the 1960&#39;s... and continue \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; see if &#39;other&#39; ideas work.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; After all... sweeping radio signals, and snowy video pictures \nare \n&gt; &gt; &gt; only a couple of snippets of the frequencies available for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; experimentation. Even my limited idea of what the Ion lamp \nmight \n&gt; do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; could be way off... but I have to try it. I might be surprised \n&gt; what \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it might be capable of. It might not only offer increased \n&gt; intensity \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and stimulation. Maybe it could even offer more than that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll keep trying new things... and I&#39;ll make sure to share them \n&gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the group.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for asking...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;threadsintyme@&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;Threadsintyme@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An interesting setup, Mike...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do have a question though.,..what is the ion lamp for? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have you had any success photographing any spirits?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Al\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -- &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who care to see...
