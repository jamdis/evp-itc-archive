Interesting response. I have lost several recordings also. Like you say, 
they just seem to disappear. I thought that maybe I was doing something 
wrong. It is interesting to see that someone else has had the same 
experience.

I use an Olympus digital voice recorder and have no problems with it. As 
for the original post, I never used to get anything when I first 
started. Now it is hit or miss.
