Well, not much time for people to wake up, less than 2.5 years. I can't
imagine every culture in the world having the exact same date in prophecy
and it means nothing.  I'm talking the 2012 thing, it's not just the Mayans.
It's in Europe, China, India, Egypt, Native Americans, the Bible, just to
name a few off the top of my head, plus it's from the GB as well.
