I=C2=A0forget to address the Cult thing.=C2=A0 

Yes it is a Cult when you =
don't look at common sense and search for=C2=A0ideas outside of your "NORM"=
=C2=A0 More than that, it is very much a cult when you are shot down, ridic=
uled and basically called everything other than a human-being when you ques=
tion an idea of a group.

I have huge amounts of sympathy for this idea.=C2=
=A0 I understand loss.=C2=A0 This is extremely difficult for me to express.=


If this is a faith based thing, then so be it.=C2=A0 I walk away and bles=
s you, wish you well.=C2=A0 More than that I will be there for you if you n=
eed to talk.

But if this is a thing of Science, then it needs to be unders=
tood and examined.=C2=A0 It needs to be looked at in an unbiased light, for=
 what it is.=C2=A0 It needs to be studied.

Now there are a lot of people h=
ere that are going to kiss=C2=A0Frank's ass for a box.=C2=A0 And anytime a =
person meets with resistance over simple questions.=C2=A0 That is cause for=
 concerns.=C2=A0 It has a Cult feel.=C2=A0 (I should know I was raised a Se=
venth Day Adventist) LOL=C2=A0 I am just saying LOL

Insults? You are the one who posts insults. Frank's reply to an email,=
(addressed to him by the way), was not addressed to you. But, you felt it n=
ecessary to respond with a snide, cryptic remark. 

You state you are here =
to find "the truth".? Have you ever tried to communicate with a spirit box?=
 Are you a Paranormal Investigator? I haven't seen any posts where you offe=
r any information about your beliefs.
=C2=A0I responded to your post last w=
eek and you ignored me. This is a group of "like minded "people who discuss=
 RTSC sessions and share findings we others. We exchange ideas and offer he=

 serve to demean others . =C2=A0
Now that I have explained my position, you=
