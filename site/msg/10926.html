I watched a bit of it. Kinda cool approach kudos for that =) He should turn his radio down a bit in the car tho it sounds better on lower volume. Pretty good tune choices overall LOL well almost all.
   
  As for the live test, interesting setup. But then people there started talking to each other in the background chit chatting while doing the experiment and then they got someone on the phone who was asking questions and thats pretty much when I tuned out. I did do a dual record for a few minutes using the audio/light flashes but havent had time to go thru it yet. I will let ya know if i had any results.
   
  Not sure how thier session ended. As usual I had to go to bed.
