Yep thats pretty much how it goes unless they press me to share it with who=
 the message is for and even then the timing has to be right. May be then, =
may be a year later but the messages always get thru to who they are meant =
to.

There is no doubt in my mind =
about that. You are right April =3D) In the beginning I did seek some proof=
 for my own sanity. But time and time again I have learned much more than I=

I would definitely call that proof. The strengt=

IMO, in this case there is no way it would be=
