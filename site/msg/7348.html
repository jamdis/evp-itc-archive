&gt; Because by contract PSR has to use the word demon on each episode 
(J/J). The
&gt; name alone gets people interested, scared and so on. LOL Oh, I love 
Lorainne
&gt; Warren&#x27;s method of removing Chip from a trance. She slapped the 
shit out of
&gt; him. he he hehe I almost fell over! You could hear the 
sarcastic &quot;thank you&quot;
&gt; from Chip. LMFAO
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,

&gt; 
&gt; Yes, the old &quot;demon chasing&quot; crap, once again. 
&gt; 
&gt; I brought the following thought up elsewhere and will bring it up 
&gt; here for consideration, too. If ghosts are coming through the box 
&gt; and thus are not in a good state of mind, how come on Paranormal 
&gt; State CM was willing to believe the message given by the ghost via 
&gt; the box as being truth (The ghost via the box said a &quot;demon&quot; was 
&gt; holding the ghosts captive there)? 
&gt; 
&gt; I would suggest that perhaps a ghost (assuming we are talking about 
a 
&gt; disembodied person who remains earthbound) is not in a healthy 
state 
&gt; of mind one would consider &quot;stable,&quot; but trapped in emotional 
trauma 
&gt; of some sort. Thus, how reliable could the message of a ghost then 
&gt; be? ;)

&gt; &gt; Don&#x27;t know if anyone caught it, but Frank&#x27;s box was used on last
&gt; &gt; night&#x27;s episode of Paranormal State on A&amp;E. They were 
investigating
&gt; &gt; an old insane asylum, and they had Chris Moon as a guest 
&gt; investigator
&gt; &gt; with the box. You can see the promo clip here:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; http://www.pennstat eprs.com/ ps_asylum. mov
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here&#x27;s the site for the show itself:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; http://www.aetv. com/paranormal- state/index. jsp
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For those not familiar, its a half hour show that follows along 
the
&gt; &gt; &quot;Penn State Paranormal Research Society&quot; and different cases they 
&gt; take
&gt; &gt; on. Their niche in the &quot;paranormal reality tv show&quot; market is that
&gt; &gt; the group&#x27;s leader follows a more Christian orientated skew on
&gt; &gt; happenings. Lots of &quot;demons&quot; (they have Lorraine Warren guest all 
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; time), and they usually try to do investigations/ communication 
only
&gt; &gt; during what they call &quot;dead time&quot;, 3am-4am, or &quot;the polar 
opposite 
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; 3pm - the time Jesus gave is life for all mankind&quot; as they put 
it. 
&gt; Oh,
&gt; &gt; and they have an &quot;occult specialist&quot; on the team that so far has 
&gt; been
&gt; &gt; anything but.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; On the positive side, they did actually get (and record for later
&gt; &gt; analysis) live communication on the box in response to questions 
&gt; being
&gt; &gt; asked. And on the analysis and isolation of the recorded parts, 
you
&gt; &gt; could actually hear what was being said (as opposed to the usual 
of
&gt; &gt; Chris acting as a go-between for very distorted sounds like on 
those
&gt; &gt; youtube videos). So it was good to see it a)working in the &quot;field&quot;
&gt; &gt; and b)get some exposure on a tv show.
