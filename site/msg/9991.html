Heard both but was a challenge for me as usual.  Actually had to listen to the clipped version to get it the first time, then I could pick it out on the raw.  It seemed like you mostly clipped the slack phonoics between the YES BRUCE and THEY DO THAT.

Would you agree that evpmaker messages tend to include more words and complete sentences than tradition evp?  For me, it ain't easy to pick out the messages with evpmaker and probably in 50% of the samples I hear the messages only after reading the script a few times.  I trust I will improve with time.  Thanks for the comparison.  Ron L

Subject: [EVP-ITC] EXAMPLE OF A RAW AND CLIPPED FILE

Here is an example of a file presented raw and the version after the 
crap has been clipped.

you decide what the big controversey is about. And if it affects the
validity of the files message.

I will post them in the files section in their own folder labeled 
"RAW & CLIPPED"

Feedback is encouraged!
