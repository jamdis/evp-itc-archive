I think it shows that it&#39;s the raw audio that matters. To me \nthere seems to be many that think my boxes are like somekind of oracle or \nsomething, and they miss the fact that it&#39;s only supplying the raw audio for \nspirits to form their voices with. I don&#39;t want to cheapen the experience, \nbut I want to show that it is more of a science now, it&#39;s repeatable, and \nother systems can be made that do the same thing. This FM scan method has \nthe advantage of fewer parts, smaller boards, and seemingly easier to use. I \nthink this system would be marketable.\n\nThanks Steve for posting your voices!\n\nFrank\n\n\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] New Files Uploaded to file section\n&gt;Date: Thu, 21 Jun 2007 03:54:06 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This was just sitting at home asking simple questions.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nPC Magazine���s 2007 editors��� choice for best Web mail���award-winning Windows \nLive Hotmail. \nhttp://imagine-windowslive.com/hotmail/?locale=en-us&ocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_mini_pcmag_0507"}
