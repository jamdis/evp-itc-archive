<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>they seem to like any thing that resonates acoustically or 
mechanically.
those are scary itc pics--just like the victorian era ones.

if you plug a speaker into the mic input and use that for a mic when 
playing guitar/ the voice frequencies that carry the 
intelligibility , abou 200-1500 hz should  be stronger because they 
will be stepped up in voltage before going to amplifier.  

the spiritualist types, the serious ones used to use an ear trumpet 
in the same way (backwards) for similar reasons.

you must be up to your butt in entities like youre a magnet for 
them :}

the place where we live originally belonged to my gggrandfather and 
is thought to be pretty spooky;  i cant record anything normal in the 
bathroom - which iwould otherwise do for the acoustics- because its 
always packed with spooks that never say anything really evidential 
or comprehensible--always different ones like theyre all standing on 
the platform waiting for a train--  nothing worth hearing.


i havent done most of these things since about 1977 so i have to 
retry them first with completely different recorders etc.

if you hear somebody say &quot;yes .  hello.&quot;   thats what carl agreed to 
say as identifier (carl schleicher head of mankind research,  which 
pioneered a lot ofghost stuff-kirlian photography.  carls original 
partner and buddy from about 1958-1996 was chris bird author of 
secret life of plants, divining hand, similar books.

carl croaked 1999, chris 1996   chris was very much into comms from 
beyond too

&gt; I&#x27;m tryin to wrap my tired brain around what you just said Ken LOL
&gt;    
&gt;   I just played it over the stereo speakers I use for the pc, 
turned the volume down extremely low, and recorded it with the old pc 
mic (which has a foil cone aparatus over it which has been there for 
ages). 
&gt;    
&gt;   With the music it is often a problem they are way too loud. I 
sometimes have to turn my volume down because the loud crackle static 
is often more voice layers that can only be heard at lower volume.
&gt;    
&gt;   I tried using oboe music...supposedly the oboe is one of the 
instruments which closely replicates the human voice in sound. Not 
great results wise, for me. They like the guitar better. 
&gt;    
&gt;   They also like it if I sing/hum. Little known fact about me, I 
sometimes have musical compositions and entire songs pop into my head 
in an instant and it will bug me until i sing it, hum it, or write 
the words down....once I do then I can go on with life as usual LOL 
the problem is I am about as musical as I am technical. I dont play 
an instrument and I have never studied music so theres no way I can 
write down half of what I hear but I jot the words, hum the tune, 
whatever and get it out of my system.
&gt;    
&gt;   I have one here someplace I recorded with me singing/humming and 
evp/someone else doing backup and singing along with me. What that&#x27;s 
all about I still couldn&#x27;t tell you. Strange but true and kinda 
freakish. 
&gt;    
&gt;   Either way just try some music out guys, play it low, anything 
without words is preferable.
&gt;   Record and see what pops up. Make sure ya check the reverse on 
that file too!
&gt;

&gt;           music is as far away from white noise as you can get.
&gt; 
&gt; there are no voice fragments for entities to manipulate
&gt; 
&gt; voice voltage is being added to voltage of music which acts as 
&gt; carrier, via some inductor or nonlinear element near input.
&gt; 
&gt; audio transformer turned backwards connected to input with large 
&gt; speaker on8 ohm side and put at bottom of sound confining container 
&gt; like plastic garbage can would eliminate hit-or-miss voltage 
&gt; superposition.
&gt; 
&gt; use a speaker for the microphone at bottom of wastebasket hook to 
&gt; low side of audio transformer. voices could be about 20 times louder
&gt; 
&gt; going to try it myself asap..speaker as microphone

&gt; &gt; I know they like to use music. In particular they can make use of 
&gt; certain instruments to propel thier voice across. So last night I 
&gt; played a short clip of Joe Satriani&#x27;s &quot;always with you always with 
&gt; me&quot; it contains music only, no vocals. I discovered that in the 
first 
&gt; few seconds of the clip the voices were able to sustain a loud, 
&gt; comprehensive line of communication until Satriani kicked it into 
&gt; high gear and the guitar notes were too loud and drowned everything 
&gt; out. Some could be heard on regular playback, most could be heard 
&gt; clearer at a slowed down rate of -74% &amp; -30%. I then did a session 
&gt; with no music. Both sessions lasted under 1 minute and both 
sessions 
&gt; had a yeild of about 18 clips/sentences. The difference being that 
&gt; more of the music clips were louder and clearer to understand for 
me 
&gt; and hopefully for you too. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Heres a few of the evp clips for you to download and evaluate. 
&gt; Many are very loud so I recommend you lower the sound DOWN... ALOT 
&gt; til you play it once to see what volume level it has. I use stereo 
&gt; speakers so I am used to blasting my head off LOL so careful you 
dont 
&gt; blow a speaker or your eardrums. Even I usually turn them down 
&gt; because the level of vibration and noise may be too much for my 
dogs 
&gt; ears. The process I used was the same, p1 filter only, amped at +15 
&gt; which works differently depending on what comes across and what I 
&gt; used for background sound. When using music the noise level is 
&gt; definitely alot higher and you will need to lower your sound for 
&gt; those LOL
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Only sharing some of the ones I think others can hear. The music 
&gt; session had alot more than the nonmusic session. I will send a 
short 
&gt; clip of satriani (the first part where the voices were the best) so 
&gt; that if anyone wants to give it a try they can.
