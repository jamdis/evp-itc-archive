Some \nreally good responses to my questions.  Hey babs, i think you should \ngive the RS box a little time and maybe you will start to get stuff.  \nAlthough i have a 12-469 also and it really sux compared to the 12-\n470.  The constant pulsing noise in the 469 model just drives me crazy \nenough to not concentrate.  Try looking for an older style model of the \n12-470, that&#39;s probably the best radio i own hands down.  Instant \nresults always and consistently.  All my boxes work, but they are \nfinicky sometimes.  No need to comment to my posted files guys, just \nlisten and see if i&#39;m on some sort of a right track with the \ncommunication.\n\n-Steve H."}
