<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Holly,  Nice to see you here!!  It&#x27;s Debbie! I lost your e-mail 
address .. I have two RS Hacks that I bought from MC here.  Let me 
know if you might want them .. My goal is to have long two-way 
conversations and the RS Hacks are hard for me to use.  

I&#x27;m fascinated by the results of the &quot;radio-sweep&quot; method and 
the &quot;boxes&quot; are amazing to experiment with, but you can achieve the 
same results by sweeping manually. 

Talk soon,

Debbie

&gt;  If anyone would care to go to my site that I set up to share 
&gt; information(http://purplealiengirl.tripod.com/), they will hear how 
my 
&gt; contacts swear I am their long lost Purple Princess. It would be 
&gt; difficult for me to biased against women since I am one on the 
inside, 
&gt; even &quot;normal&quot; ghosts claim they see a woman. While a straight, 
albeit 
&gt; old, male, I prefer the feminine side of things. Purple is not so 
much 
&gt; a type of alien, or Planet. It&#x27;s a spiritual designation, as in the 
&gt; Purple Lady, or someone on a spiritual mission. I don&#x27;t understand 
it 
&gt; completely either, but it&#x27;s connected to the Catholics some how. I 
&gt; don&#x27;t want to get caught up in religious dogma. 
&gt; 
&gt;  The people with boxes were supposed to be testing them, not going 
off 
&gt; on ego trips, and claiming to be great mediums which was somehow 
&gt; bestowed on them by box use. There is one guy that got four, and 
&gt; claimed none worked, so that&#x27;s four out of circulation. Yeah, I am 
a 
&gt; bit on the gullible side. There some I can&#x27;t account for, like #21, 
I 
&gt; have no idea where it is, or if I skipped a number. A woman in San 
&gt; Diego did get a box directly from me last year, but somehow, Moon 
ended 
&gt; up with it.  After last year, of almost non-stop box building, I 
just 
&gt; reached a point where I dread making them for people anymore.
&gt; 
&gt;  Rosemary Guiley has one, Robin ( a local researcher&#x27;s wife) got 
one in 
&gt; December for thier wedding. Woman in San Diego had one. There are 
women 
&gt; that are deserving of boxes, and who have waited the longest, but I 
&gt; dread giving anymore because it creates more demand. 
&gt; 
&gt;  It&#x27;s just a raido for crying out loud!
