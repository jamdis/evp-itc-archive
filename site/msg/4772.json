Good luck, you will soon be able to turn it out.  The 470 doesn;t have the ticking and the speakers are built in.  Joel uses the 470 more than I do. The 469 I consider MY BOX, lol use I&#39;m attached to it just a little more than he is.  \n\nbabiarz3 &lt;babiarz3@...&gt; wrote:          \nSteve, hope your holidays were wonderful.

Hey babs, i think you should \n&gt; give the RS box a little time and maybe you will start to get stuff. \n&gt; Although i have a 12-469 also and it really sux compared to the 12-\n&gt; 470. The constant pulsing noise in the 469 model just drives me crazy \n&gt; enough to not concentrate. Try looking for an older style model of the \n&gt; 12-470, that&#39;s probably the best radio i own hands down. Instant \n&gt; results always and consistently.
