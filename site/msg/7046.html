<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Now that I&#x27;ve been at this for a week, I&#x27;ve got a ton of questions 
(well, OK, maybe 5 or 6).  I&#x27;ll try to check the archives to make sure 
these haven&#x27;t already been discussed to death before I ask.  Also, is 
there a FAQ I could look at?  OTOH, it may be helpful to have basic 
questions revisited from time to time in case anyone has come up with 
new ideas about them.

Anyway, first question -  I&#x27;ve had a couple of instances where I heard a 
response loud and clear at the time, but on playback, the words are 
actually quite faint.  Is there a technological reason for that?  I have 
a decent degree of psychic ability and am working with a spirit whom 
I&#x27;ve been communicating with telepathically for over a year.  Is is more 
likely that I am picking up on the answer psychically as well, which 
amps up how I perceive it at the time?  And would his communicating with 
me psychically divert some of his energy from the ghost box 
communication, which would also explain why it came through fainter on that?

I don&#x27;t want to exhaust you with a bunch of questions all at once, so 
I&#x27;ll save the rest for later.  You&#x27;d start to feel like you&#x27;re dealing 
wit a 5 year old - &quot;Why, why, why, why, why?!!!&quot;  =)
