<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yep that can work but I agree with the previous post on pro and con of that method. You can also use your pc microphone and software like audacity to record which is free if you already have a mic. If not they are pretty inexpensive to purchase. You can also experiment with free methods such as evpmaker, sweep tuning a radio, recording white noise, recording silence (ambient noise), running water, and you could modify a radio at little expense to you to make a shack hack or other simulation of a franks box.

Some websites to help you

&gt; Hello all! I have been a member of this group for a little while now, and I finally have a question..lol..
&gt; 
&gt; I have always been interested in EVP work, but have never really had the opportunity to &quot;try for myself&quot;...I am soo far from mechanically inclined it isn&#x27;t funny, and don&#x27;t have alot of money to spend...
&gt; 
&gt; Are there any suggestions on what I can do to start out maybe? Something cheap? That is easy to use? I have an old &#x27;Realistic&#x27;
&gt; cassette recorder with variable speech control ( pitch and speed controls)...is this anything that I can experiment with? Will it work (even for now until I can afford something better? lol)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance all!!
