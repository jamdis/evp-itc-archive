Ok, here is your "evidence" RJ, last year in spring a  girl was killed, her=
 
name was Annie Le, back then i was new to this but, got  some great files=
, 
which i gave let police hear on DAY  ONE of her being only still missing=
.  
Even in the files themselves  some spirits are telling me she is dead, =
her 
voice came through, I have tons of  them, these are a few, and yes I l=
eft what 
they say on them, some are clearer  then others, and if the polic=
e officer 
was able to hear them, you should be  able to as well. I don't k=
now why i 
even bother to worry my head over doubters  anyway.  I posted th=
ese to all 
three lists, because Bruce can  verify what happened  back then=
 too.   You will 
also  find that the files themselves verify this by the q=
uestions asked of  
them.   Enjoy,  sf

RJ, unless you lived here of course  you would not have proo=

you were not here when  the event happened, so what's the =

happened, why would any one else have cause to believe  yo=

that murdered girl before they ever found her  bo=

for the police, and also posted the  files on the=
 lists, police did find her 
body right where  spirit said it was, "in the =

as the job he  did too.  This
