Or if you do enhance, keep the original as is for comparison.\n\n  -=\r\n---- Original Message ----- \n  From: Rj \n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n  S=\r\nent: Saturday, May 16, 2009 7:42 AM\n  Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: what you h=\r\near is what you get\n\n\n\n\n\n        There is no one opinion or consensus on ho=\r\nw or if to filter or &quot;enhance&quot;.   The problem is that these programs do not=\r\n understand what speech is either - otherwise you could press a button and =\r\nhave it just pull out the words and hrow everything else away.    They work=\r\n only by manipulating frequencies or frequency ranges.  \n\n        To some p=\r\noint, they can recognize noise: but not all noise, and will remove some thi=\r\nngs that are not noise, and leave some things behind that are noise.  Carvi=\r\nng out frequencies in this manner can result in sounds being created which =\r\nwere not on the original recording, and sound like words.\n\n        The same=\r\n is true with other kinds of enhancement, which again can quiet some freque=\r\nncies and emphasize others.  Since the program again does not know what is =\r\nreally a word and what is noise, sounds are again being reshaped, and with =\r\nenough shaping, they can become like speech.  This is sometimes called pixe=\r\nlization.\n\n        Some are of the opinion to not filter or enhance at all:=\r\n it can be hard enough to identity real speech in a blank recording: tortur=\r\ning the frequencies just makes it more confusing.  Sure, it may result in m=\r\nore things that sound like speech, but it really depends what you are after=\r\n: recording accuracy, or exciting results.  To get the best of both worlds,=\r\n it would seem the non-processed method would be best.\n\n        --- On Fri,=\r\n 5/15/09, SnowfireL@... &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n          From: Sn=\r\nowfireL@... &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt;\n          Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: wh=\r\nat you hear is what you get\n          To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n         =\r\n Date: Friday, May 15, 2009, 9:37 PM\n\n\n\n          I am new at this, and I a=\r\nm using a RS 20-125, I am not sure how to adjust the tape, I bought the Gol=\r\nd Wave, it seems the easiest to use.
