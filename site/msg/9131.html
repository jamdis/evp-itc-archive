<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Everyone,

I have been reading the back and forth posts about ideas on how to 
deal with the individual selling the hacks on ebay for inflated 
prices.

I posted my thoughts on that individual yesterday. I would now like 
to render my opinion as to the subject of what we or anyone can do 
about it.

My suggestion is DO NOTHING! Now before everybody&#x27;s jaw hits the 
floor, hear me out.

A couple of months ago I would have been the one to lead the charge 
in the assault on this guy in the name of box justice.

I can now say with confidence, That is not the way to handle it.
Let me explain why I believe this way. Without going into a lot of 
detail, I was a tough street kid that grew up on the streets of 
Brooklyn, I also served my country proudly for six years as a us army 
green beret, then to a career as a FDNY Fireman whose heart and 
health where both broken at 911.

My point is, I have always lived my life believing that anything I 
did not agree with or that did not fit my sense of right and wrong
whether it be right or wrong, could be easily solved with aggression 
of some kind.

It took a long while and much sole searching and a lot of 
communication interpretation from our friends on the other side.
But I have come to learn that aggressive action in any form is 
detrimental to the harmony and peace of the whole involved.

Guy&#x27;s like this guy on ebay do not and can not last in the face of 
good and well intentioned people that are here and willing and trying 
to get the word of this miraculous research and spirit communication 
out to as many people as are in need or want of it.

That is how we can stop people like this bottom feeder. By spreading 
the knowledge of this research from one person to the next. Our 
friends have stated time and time again that any negative energy will 
be detrimental to the communication and the research, and positive 
harmony and vibration will serve to strengthen the bridge between our 
worlds.

So even if you are not religious and do not believe in Jesus Christ 
as I do, these words ring true no matter what context they come from
this wisdom was spoken by my lord two thousand years ago.

&quot;do not check the splinter in your brothers eye, until you have 
checked the plank in your own&quot;

Truthfully, anything we could do to sway this individuals sale of 
these boxes would be minimal. Negativity and greed always find a 
crack to seep through.

My suggestion is lets try a little harder to spread the word of the 
research and educate individuals that are or may become interested, 
through all the various outlets available to us on the web concerning 
the paranormal research community. There are endless chat boards, 
groups and forums plus websites and word of mouth. 
Instead of trying to stop this idiot from defrauding innocent 
unknowledgable people. Lets make sure the knowledge is out there for 
them and we are here to help them and guy&#x27;s like Mr. ebay will 
disappear on their own.

And we will not have expended an ounce of negative energy in the 
process.
That&#x27;s how I feel, but that&#x27;s just me.

Bruce</pre>
