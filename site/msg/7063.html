Hi guys. 
   
  Just got back today. Spent the last 2 nights trying to get my pc up and running so I could get back online, and came back to see some junk had transpired. A few of you seem to completely disagree, a few of you seem to wholeheartedly agree.... doesnt really matter with who you do or dont agree. I think thats about where we sit.
   
  As for Bruce, he has unjoined and can be found over on Jeremy's group. Feel free to join him if you wish. Nobody will feel bad toward you if you do. A couple of you already have. As for his ban...never happened. He was just put on suspension for attacking members on and off the board, and I have to say it wasn't cool at all what was said. Just very disappointing.
   
  I like Bruce, I think he CAN be a nice guy...I also know he can be quite nasty when he gets upset. Even he admits that. A few others here have that quality as well. Everyones human, we all make mistakes. I like everyone here, I just wish that you guys would show more respect for each other with your words. You all want to communicate with the other side, how about starting communication HERE on this side with each other. If you can improve that who knows maybe that link to the other side will improve as well?
   
  As for the mods, like it or not there are a couple of them. Since Frank S had some things going on and I work alot, two people were made mods simply to help out and allow people to join or approve spam posts when we arent around. They never thought they would have to deal with childish antics, in fact they didnt even have the ban buttons in operation. I thought we would never need that here. 
   
  They arent dictators, just people same as you and I. They havent banned anyone yet nor have I and its gotten pretty nasty here a few times and on any other group those involved would be kicked to the curb faster than you can say "what happened".
   
  So to answer your questions, no Bruce was not banned, yes he was temporarily suspended from posting and yes he did exit voluntarily. And yes it is sad to see, very sad indeed.
   
  I cant control who says what, nor can I control thier actions, I can only try to control myself. If we all had a little more self control, conflicts like this wouldnt arise.
   
  For those who wanted my input, there ya go. Not much more I can say or do on this subject.
   
  Misty
