<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, in this case, most of them were probably crazy and some of the EVP
I&#x27;ve gotten indicates they&#x27;re still crazy. So who knows what they&#x27;re
thinking?

As far as normal people who end up sticking around as ghosts in cemeteries,
that&#x27;s an even bigger mystery. I think traumatic experiences, such as being
killed on a battlefield, can make you stick in that area. I was told by a
Scottish friend that there are still ghosts fighting the battle on the
battlefield portrayed in the movie Braveheart. That was over 700 years ago.
No one told them they&#x27;re dead.

&gt;  It&#x27;s amazing how these people that die, stay around in the same place
&gt; they died, one would think they would be free of the sick physical body, go
&gt; exploring, or look for loved ones, why do they want to hang around an empty
&gt; old building?

&gt;  One of the most fascinating ones I ever got was recorded in the ruins
&gt; of a former mental hospital. The building is shaped like an &quot;H&quot; and our
&gt; group of about 10 people was standing in one arm of the &quot;H&quot; looking through
&gt; the windows to the opposite arm. We saw a shadow moving around inside the
&gt; building in the other arm. We were just discussing this when a hoarse voice
&gt; came in THREE times on the recording and said &quot;It&#x27;s Harold Wing.&quot; This voice
&gt; was not audible to our ears at the time of the investigation.
&gt; Later on, one of the members of our group was able to access old records
&gt; for the mental hospital and found there was indeed a patient named Harold
&gt; Wing who died there of typhoid fever in 1936. There is no way any of us
&gt; could&#x27;ve known that at the time and it&#x27;s doubtful anyone living would&#x27;ve
&gt; known about it at the time, either.

&gt;&gt;  Playing acrh skeptic, what value is a voice for survival evidence if you
&gt;&gt; don&#x27;t know who it is? How do you know where it came from? Or can say beyond
&gt;&gt; doubt that it&#x27;s even &quot;paranormal&quot;? People have millions of these voices by
&gt;&gt; now.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have been experimenting with EVP for about a year now (in my home) and
&gt;&gt;&gt; i have captured some brilliant evidence for survival.The first voice i
&gt;&gt;&gt; captured was that of a little boy saying &#x27;&#x27;hello&#x27;&#x27;at 1.30 am.It was so clear
&gt;&gt;&gt; that others could agree on and the voice could be still heard some fifteen
&gt;&gt;&gt; feet away from the recorder.I have captured other voices too, just as
&gt;&gt;&gt; impressive.Unfortunately i can&#x27;t upload because my recorder is a micro
&gt;&gt;&gt; cassette type.
