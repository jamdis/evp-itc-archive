Frank, Reading all the BS those two were spewing on a daily basis, did not =

our decision to do whatever you feel is necessary to keep the group intact =
and a pleasant place to be. =C2=A0
I, for one am sick and tired of those wh=

not scientifically based and never will be. =C2=A0Those who wish to walk do=
wn that narrow minded path will never experience what we have experienced. =
=C2=A0Thank you for your willingness to "uninvite" those who only want to p=
lace negativity into the group.
