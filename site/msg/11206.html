&gt;&gt; Hi Al,
&gt;&gt; Do you know if there is a digital voice recorder that has an SD
&gt; card slot? That would be nice to switch SD cards from time to time.
&gt; Especially if one had a great EVP.
&gt; &lt;rest snipped&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thought I&#x27;d jump in here...
&gt;
&gt; First of all - I use mainly full spectrum sound recorders rather than
&gt; the standard hand-held digital voice recorders. Two reasons: 1. There
&gt; are paranormal NON-VOICE sounds out there that are not being picked
&gt; up by the limited response of the voice-only recorders, 2. The higher
&gt; frequencies in the 20-20 kHz human sound range contribute to the
&gt; intelligibility of consonants. Using recorders with a higher
&gt; frequency response makes for clearer understanding of voices -
&gt; particularly those that are &quot;whispered&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; My first foray into using full spectrum recorders led me to buy the
&gt; (now discontinued) Fostex MR-8.
&gt;
&gt; http://namm.harmony-central.com/WNAMM03/Content/Fostex/PR/MR-8.html
&gt;
&gt; While it is not extremely portable nor hand-held, it is &quot;luggable&quot;
&gt; and is perfect for stationary recording. It is full spectrum, battery-
&gt; powered, uses Compact Flash and has inputs for multiple external
&gt; microphones. [The later models use hard drives for storage making
&gt; them less rugged for field use, IMHO, and require AC power making
&gt; them less flexible as to location.] You can find used units in good
&gt; condition and relatively cheap on ebay. (Oh - and you can use either
&gt; USB download or read directly off the CF for storage/analysis.) Plus
&gt; the multiple inputs allow you to record infrsound and ultrasound on
&gt; separate channels in synch with the human audible sound range.
&gt;
&gt; For over a year now - I&#x27;ve used the Zoom H4.

&gt;
&gt; Again...full spectrum, battery-operated, hand-held, uses SD storage.
&gt; USB interface. The built-in stereo mikes are amazingly sensitive but
&gt; the unit also has inputs for external mikes along with phantom power.
&gt; I use it with a pair of noise-cancelling headphones and have
&gt; definitly heard EVPs in real-time.
&gt;
&gt; Zoom also has a newer model - the H2. Just as good.
&gt;

&gt; prodID=1916&amp;brandID=4
&gt;
&gt; http://www.zzounds.com/item--ZOMH2
&gt;
&gt; The only complaint I have about the H4 is that it doesn&#x27;t have a
&gt; lanyard (I&#x27;d hate to drop it) nor does it come with a carrying case
&gt; (I bought a new case for a Fluke multimeter at an electronics supply
&gt; shop which does the trick).
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps.
