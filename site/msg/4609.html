<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all,

I&#x27;m new to the group but probably know some of you from another 
list.  I haven&#x27;t been too active in the realm of EVP recording 
recently, but have had what I consider excellent results in the past 
using my little refurbished Ebay-bargain Olympus VN-120 PC.

I&#x27;m anxious to start recording again and am feeling pretty 
overwhelmed by the technology you all seem to be using.  I know a 
little about using good headphones and denoiser programs, but beyond 
that I&#x27;m electronically challenged.  Still, I wonder if there are 
simple techniques I can experiment with to increase my success.  I 
think I&#x27;m a little bored.

I&#x27;ve felt pretty strongly that I&#x27;ve been communicating with a very 
small number of entities, and I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s due to the 
limitations of my equipment. My most impressive EVPs have always been 
captured around my own home, particularly outside on the hill and 
near the barn.  I&#x27;ve gotten two inside my house (after inviting 
spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been negative messages.  

Anyway, I&#x27;m thinking about getting another DVR and would love to hear 
your thoughts and recommendations about which ones are best.  I would 
like to communicate with more advanced entities eventually, but 
unfortunately don&#x27;t have the brain for building anything myself.

Thanks!

Robin</pre>
