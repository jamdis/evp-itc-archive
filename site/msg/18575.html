<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You don&#x27;t understand, those cloud images are sometimes more than some
retarded imagination. Same as the voices the rest of us hear. If you are so
sure it&#x27;s all hallucinatory, why do you bother us with the brainiac BS.

 You have voices that cuss and swear over these boxes, many can hear it, but
that still is not good enough, it&#x27;s still ignoring all evidence, and no
eividence is good enough.
The entites are not going to kiss your ass. It is of no consequence if you
believe in it or not, except to you.

 This is a cloud image, it is a representation of the coming comet. A moron
can see it, so don&#x27;t sit there all smug an tell me it&#x27;s imagination and
worthless. The skeptics want to make everyone afraid to look up, they want
us all afraid and controlled.

 Brain or outside, personally I don&#x27;t care! It&#x27;s the message that matters.
 Stop being so fearful, and imagine something else exists wihtout science&#x27;s
persmission.

&gt; For me, the question is not whether sense will emerge: it will. Just like
&gt; when looking at the randomness clouds eventually will emerge pictures.
&gt;
&gt; For me, the question is where is that sense coming from: inside me, my
&gt; brain? Or some entity?
&gt;
&gt; My problem is that many of the results people post are ambiguous. While
&gt; they could be from spirits, I can not find anything about them that rules
&gt; out just the operator&#x27;s brain.
&gt;
&gt; And so I try to listen to the specific claims people make about the box and
&gt; what it can reveal. And I try to construct my experiments to see if I can
&gt; rule out the brain, leaving the spirits.
&gt;
&gt; Why is that so awful?

&gt; &gt; Just try listening to the gibberish for awhile, see if sense emerges from
&gt; &gt; the chaos. When I tried my frist linear sweep system all I heard was
&gt; &gt; gibberish, then all the sudden I could hear them. I think the problem is
&gt; all

&gt; &gt; &gt; Since all I hear is gibberish, and since interpreting such gibberish is
&gt; &gt; &gt; subjective, and can be influenced by telling people what they are
&gt; supposed
&gt; &gt; &gt; to hear first, I would agree this kind of test is poor evidence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Nope, no evidencee, totally insignificant that a ghost box says &quot;ghost
&gt; &gt; &gt; box&quot;, must be anecdotal imaginary hallucinations caused by supplying
