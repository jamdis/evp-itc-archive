Juli Velazquez has both 469 and \nold model 470 and she prefers the 469 and gets very good results with \nit.\n\nMy suggestion is make your local radio shack manager aware that you \nare searching for these particular radios and can he please try to \nlocate one for you. I&#39;m sure that there is one or two sitting on a \nshelf in some radio shack somewhere.\n\nIf you can get an older model 469 that does not have the clicking, It \nlooks exactly like the older model 470 and comes in the cardboard box \nnox the plastic see through rapper.\n\nhang in there something will turn up. And if not don&#39;t let that \ndiscourage you from your research just do your best and what you have \nwill work for you.\n\nbruce"}
