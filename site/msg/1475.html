Yeah Steve has gotten some good results. I would like to hear some of yours and Rosemary's as well as the others. I think that the more people share the more others can learn and try things out for themselves. 
   
  They have always called me by my complete name no matter what method I use. Music, Sweep Tuning, Water, Evpmaker, Radio, etcetera... there are some voices which remain consistent enough to modulate any source.

          Hi Misty, thank you for your post. I will upload some files. There 
have been interesting sessions with how the Boxes address people by 
name. And now that it's happening to Steve it seems like this is part 
of the phenomena of the Box that is repeatable and observed by 
others. -Bill

box voices but its refreshing to hear others results and see the 
variations as with any other evp method, it differs by user/location. 
LOL you know who you are and I wont name you all but I do hope you 
will share with us.
