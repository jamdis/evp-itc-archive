I\nmade a sweep board for it this afternoon, then found it had a seperate tuner\nboard. So I liberated the tuner from the rest, and striped everything else\nfor parts. It make primo box! This runs on six volts and takes a signal wire\nto change bands.\n\n #6 starts out &quot;Is Hultay even---wormwood&quot;. #8 is cool &quot;I think that he\nvideos this reciever&quot;, after that &quot;the alamo&#39;s on ten meter basement(?)&quot; teh\n10 meter band is at 28 to 29.5 mhz, it&#39;s one of the ham bands. So is\nbasement the bottom if 10 meters, at about 28.5Mhz if I remember right?
