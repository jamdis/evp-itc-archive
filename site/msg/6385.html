<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>They might. From what I have heard of other people&#x27;s cemetery EVPs,  
it sounds like a lot of cemeteries are populated with people who  
haven&#x27;t made it over. I find cemetery EVP to be the most fascinating  
because they seem to offer a glimpse into a chaotic and not-so-pretty  
part of the After Life that very few are willing to look at. Our  
cemeteries seem to me to truly be cities of the dead.

&gt; Gimme some opinions on this one, gang. The first part of the clip is
&gt; the speed it can through at. The repeat is slowed by about 70 percent.
&gt; I hear it as &quot;Estep.&quot; I thought I had heard the word yes, so I ask,
&gt; &quot;Yes?&quot; Under my voice is the name &quot;Andrew,&quot; then &quot;I&#x27;m Stu.&quot; &quot;Perfect.&quot;
&gt; &quot;No..??...asshole...fucking scared.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Do you hear this as I do? I&#x27;m postulating right now that because I
&gt; live immediately across the street from a cemetery, and in a
&gt; 100-year-old sitting atop a 200+-year-old foundation and cellar, that
&gt; perhaps local dead folk who haven&#x27;t crossed are popping in during
&gt; sessions. The voice that said &quot;fucking scared&quot; I swear I heard in
&gt; another file in my folder saying &quot;scared people.&quot;
