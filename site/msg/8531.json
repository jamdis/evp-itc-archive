You can see it\nin my pictures and hear it in my audio files.  Both are under Dead\nScience.\nI have to say this thing is very neat!  It really does take EMF and\nproduce words.  I will do sessions with it and post.  If you need any\ninformation on the box please feel free to email me or just wait for\nmy next Podcast at www.deadscience.com and I will talk all about it.\nRob."}
