&gt; &gt; The fact is, there are other methods that work as well, and probably
&gt;  &gt; better. Often the voices are much clearer with the simple methods,

&gt;  &gt; discouraged when I think I have a perfectly clear voice from the  
&gt; box,
&gt;  &gt; and not another person in the world can hear it.
&gt;
&gt; That&#x27;s just the curse of being psychic. It&#x27;s hard to self monitor  
&gt; your progress before presenting it publicly when your perception is  
&gt; different than most other people&#x27;s.  But even being able to hear  
&gt; message clearly yourself is a step in the right direction.  I know  
&gt; that&#x27;s something I couldn&#x27;t have done myself 10 years ago.
&gt;
&gt; Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re just spinning your wheels when the experiments  
&gt; don&#x27;t work out right, though.  We all learn from the failed  
&gt; experiments as well as the ones that worked right.  It all goes to  
&gt; help in the long run.  There are other benefits as well.  Frank&#x27;s  
&gt; Box has been helpful to the research in that it alone has created a  
&gt; buzz in the paranormal community that has drawn in a lot more  
&gt; researchers .  I don&#x27;t remember hearing that kind of excitement  
&gt; about EVP Maker despite how impressive the results from that have  
&gt; been. I&#x27;m pretty sure that you are doing what you are meant to be  
&gt; doing in all this, even if you aren&#x27;t making the kind of progress  
&gt; you&#x27;d like.
