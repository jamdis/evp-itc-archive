We had six video cameras set up in the three halls of the\nbuilding. The video for all was being monitored and recorded at a central\nlocation. Alas, we did not have microphones at the camera sites conected to\nthe central location. I wonder what we might have heard if we did?\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Mon, Jun 8, 2009 at 12:05 PM, threadsintyme@... &lt;\nThreadsintyme@...&gt; wrote:\n\nLet&#39;s just agree to end this discussion about her...\nWhy don&#39;t we discuss something on a lighter note?
