Okay now you have both models and because of that... you \nare an official memeber of the Dynamic Duo Radio Shack Hack Club.  \nWelcome!!!\n\nAnd to boot, since your 12-470 has shorter battery leads, your \nbatteries will no doubt last longer than mine because your electrons \nwill not have as far to travel to the radio, where mine will tire out \nsooner with that extra length of copper... ;-)\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; OK - I just received my used 12-470 older version radio today and \n&gt; hacked it in about 10 minutes.  Works great, BUT I noticed on mine \n&gt; the length of the battery wires were not as generous as on Mike&#39;s \n&gt; video or the 12-469 I hacked previously.  Thus, I had to sort of \nkeep \n&gt; it almost together, peering deep inside with a magnifying glass to \n&gt; make sure I had the correct wire (7th from top - green for this \none) \n&gt; and somehow snip it.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I guess I am reporting this, because you really have to pay \nattention \n&gt; to the length of the battery box wires when you tear into these - \n&gt; they do vary, and are easy to accidentally detach off of the board.\n&gt; \n&gt; LC\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So dummy here couldn&#39;t even follow Mike&#39;s great video \ninstructions \n&gt; with the RS12-469.  After driving two hours to Merida, Mexico and \n&gt; then back and putting down 600 pesos (about $55 dollars) it took me \n&gt; ten minutes to do everything UFO Geek laid out in his video for \n&gt; hacking the radio shack box.  Cut the right pin labeled mute.  \nClosed \n&gt; the box nicely.  Nothing.  Reopened the box...looked around...two \n&gt; times more...still nothing.   Not even a light or hum.  \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   Until I figure the radio thing out, I am in the mean time \ngetting \n&gt; nowhere (it seems) with the EVP Maker on my computer to generate \nEVP \n&gt; noise and using my hand recorder etc.   Wish I could try the radio \n&gt; sistem...any real geeks who can give technical suggestions would be \n&gt; greatly appreciated.  Or maybe I should just throw away my 469 and \n&gt; start over.   Dont think RS will take it back.     geek-wanna-be, \nRon \n&gt; L\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Never miss a thing.
