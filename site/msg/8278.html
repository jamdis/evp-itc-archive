<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Rhonda,

I heard it, but i&#x27;ve had a similar sound in one of my recordings 
too.  I realized that my recorder while holding it close to the 
speaker actually was brushing up against it creating a similar 
sound.  Was you recorder close to the speaker where that could have 
happened?  Just something that has happened to me in the past.
