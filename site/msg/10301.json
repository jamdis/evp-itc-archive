I think going to more compacted files will help us all in \nthe long run. We are already back to 72% rather than 96% tho most of \nthe file space was being used by someone else besides you =)\n\nI know it gets to be a bit testy around here and the other forums. I \nalso know that some of the nastiness can tear apart good working \nrelationships as well as friendships. I was just askin Frank if he \nknew if you were still sick or not because you had been very quiet \nlately.\n\nI agree sometimes its good to take a step back rather than get \nyourself caught up in the drama fests going on around us all. Thats \non and off the board as well. \n\nAs I said I know some of what goes on off of this forum, and I am sad \nto see most of it happening. I just hope everyone can regain focus \nand like you said, remember why we are here.\n\nI hope you feel better soon, and rejoin us when the stress level is \npassed. And I hope it passes soon so ya can run some test sessions \nwith the new tool that arrived!\n\nI keep telling people that all the negativity does take a toll, on us \npersonally and our working together. \n\nMisty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Get a grip--all of you.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m out of here until all this petty BS and hatred sorts out. The  \n&gt; amount of stress that I&#39;ve been through with all this fighting \nsince  \n&gt; early this year has really taken a toll on me as a person and a  \n&gt; researcher. I&#39;m going off line for awhile. If anyone wants to talk \nto  \n&gt; me, send me a private e-mail because I&#39;m going to read only/no e-\nmail  \n&gt; until I remember again why I used to wake up every day and want to  \n&gt; run to my computer to see what would be posted.\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty--as per your request, I&#39;ve deleted my files.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt;"}
