Yes, I agree that it may be possible to have PK events occur remotely. 

On=
ce we have ruled out all mundane explanations, and we think we have actual =
paranormal phenomena, then we consider what type of paranormal phenomena we=
 are dealing with.

The problem with remote PK energy is that it is extreme=
ly rare, at least when it is without conscious intent. It is so rare, that =
it only exists in theory pretty much. It is a WAY more common occurrence th=
at when we find any type of PK energy, it occurs only when the subject is p=
resent.

  It is not commonly understood that PK events =
do not require a local PK agent. While this is the far more common phenomen=
on, it is by no means the only way in which these events can manifest. I pe=
rsonally have conducted rigorous remote PK experiments many times over the =
years. This remote intention as it has come to be called is quiet real and =
remarkably replicable with the right people. This validated phenomena actua=
lly explains quite a few cases that are generally attributed to other, some=
times far more bizarre causes.

  Of course it makes sense to look for natu=
ral causes. However it is appropriate to consider alternatives if you have =
fail to locate plausible physical causations.
