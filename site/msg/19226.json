The problem I have with the Jesus stuff is that everyone, without exception, that I know, that claimed to be born again will throw friends and family under the bus for the slightest personal gain. If this Jesus stuff was real, and who everyone thought it was, that wouldn&#39;t happen--where people are turned to the darkside. The preachers wouldn&#39;t be out chasing little boys, there is a pattern, and ya have to have the honesty to look at it. Ya don&#39;t give yourself to any entity, I don&#39;t care who they claim to be, it&#39;s a trick. \n\n F-S\n\n \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Snowfire Lioness &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  on the first couple, you got, &quot;please help us,&quot; &quot;Frank, help us&quot; Paul&quot; On the lower ones, the am says, &quot;hi this is Paul&quot; &quot;safe!&quot; &quot;help me&quot; &quot;Jesus loves you Frank&quot; &quot;Save us&quot;  on the FM you have, &quot;I love you, you got me, &quot;safe&quot; &quot;76 Paul&quot; &quot; nite, nite Frank.&quot;  sf\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Frank Sumption purplealiengirl@...\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com; RTSC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Wed, Nov 17, 2010 12:59 am\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] A move foreward.
