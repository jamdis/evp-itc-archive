<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Opinions...everyone has the right to have them. The great thing is 
nobody has to agree with me on any given subject and vice versa =)

Bruce is correct that this group is founded on the belief the voices 
do exist.... as to who is on the other end well even the people here 
seem to have formed thier own ideas on that. Some based on beliefs 
some based on research some based on instinct, some just thought it 
up while watching a tv show that led them to join here. Others have 
decided it doesnt matter who what when where why or how it is being 
done, just the fact it is happening is enough to keep their interest. 
Not everyone that joins here is a believer. But everyone that joins 
here is curious and hopefully want to learn more.

I have actually heard this question/idea stated before and 
rementioned recently on a talk show dealing with ufo/government 
technology. It was only mentioned as possibility and mentions of 
conducted experiments that were used on people.

Look around you. The world as we see it is indeed a matrix, a peice 
of a peice of a peice of a much larger puzzle. In my own ITC many do 
not claim to be or ever have been a &quot;human&quot; some do not even have 
names/labels until they are given one.

The question brought up some good responses from you guys. Let&#x27;s 
leave it at that and move on =)

&gt; Nathan, 
&gt;  
&gt; I suggest you read the headline and description of this group.
&gt; We are a group of real time communication researchers that are 
&gt; continously seeking the truth. The founder of this board 
&gt; Mr. Frank Sumption has alway&#x27;s made it clear that It is not a place 
&gt; for sceptics and they will not be tolerated. We are here to study 
and 
&gt; further real time soirit communication, not have to defend every 
post 
&gt; we make or file we add. I suggest you take your negative 
accusations and 
&gt; detrimental unfounded criticism and scepticism somewhere else. 
&gt;  
&gt; You are wearing your welcome thin here, not to mention within 5 
posts 
&gt; you have contradicted yourself three times. and went from the 
philosophy 
&gt; of aliens enslaving human spirits to questioning any chance that 
this method 
&gt; of spirit communication could or does exist and is a conspiricy to 
fool unsuspecting
&gt; people like us by means of a super transmitter.
&gt;  
&gt; I have learned by experience to try and keep this type of post 
civil, So for any moderators that are reading this 
&gt; Please review the situation.

&gt; Nathan, I am amazed you would suggest or even think that!  I live 
in Cary, North Carolina and record when I have the time. There is no 
set schedule, and when I turn my radio on and someone says hello 
Michael, or even shouts out &quot;Mike Edwards&quot;, or a spirit tells me I am 
holding a carving in my hand, who would even know I turned the radio 
on? Only my wife knows I record, and we have kept this research from 
our children as well as our neighbors. So you are suggesting that 
Margaret, lets say who lives where I do not know, is playing a joke 
on me with a high tech two way radio?

&gt; Hi Nathan. I always look to relevance as a key in determining 
whether or not something is appropriate to the session. If this were 
a hoax, I would then have to seek an explanation for how private 
information is known by the &#x27;hoax perp&#x27;, particularly information 
that would require visual awareness. Some of us have examples of 
appropriate responses being given when asking things like, &quot;Can you 
name something nearby me?&quot; or &quot;Please tell me what I&#x27;m holding in my 
left hand.&quot; A sophisticated multi-transmission two way radio would 
not explain answers which require &#x27;visual&#x27; information of some kind 
(though I&#x27;ll be the first to admit my understanding of electronics is 
limited but I&#x27;m fairly confident on this aspect.) Of course, there is 
always the chance that the person running the hoax is also, or in 
partnership with, an extremely talented remote viewer or psychic who 
is able to glean that visual information from the ether or the mind 
of the experimenter. And what of those examples where people have 
confirmed the sound of the voice being &quot;just like&quot; that of their 
loved one in spirit? Surely the hoaxer isn&#x27;t also able to mimic 
people&#x27;s loved ones.If you are using EVP Maker with anything other 
than the allophones file, which contains no words to begin with, you 
are also running the possibility of &#x27;false positives&#x27; albeit they 
wouldn&#x27;t be from a hoax. Again, I look to relevance to be key, and 
relevant info that would not come easily to a stranger is even 
better. For example, I turned on my MiniBox for the very first time 
and said, &quot;Hello?&quot; and immediately received the response, &quot;Hello 
Margaret.&quot; If this were a hoax, how could that person know in less 
than 10 seconds, who I was by name. I had not given this information 
out. Not to mention that you have people experimenting 24/7 and 
receiving similar responses. How in the world could an organization 
have the manpower, technology, or even the desire, to attempt such a 
hoax? I mean that as a genuine inquiry, because there might be an 
explanation I have not thought of. I have one example where, via 
radio sweep, my communicator was able to correctly identify the 
status and location of a missing person (who it turns out was alive 
and well, so we ended up with confirmation that the info given had 
indeed been correct - which is much less complicated that trying to 
track and understand the clues when associated with the dead, or 
missing but not found.) Again, if a hoax, would that have simply been 
a lucky guess on the part of the hoaxer?Bottom line for me is ... 
have I wondered if it could be a hoax? Or simply a fortuitous tuning 
of the dial? Yes, on both accounts. But there is enough compelling 
evidence to rule out both of them as an explanation for the far too 
many relevant examples received by so many of us.Good food for 
thought, but after digesting it, I&#x27;d have to say, &quot;No, a 
sophisticated hoax does not sufficiently explain the phenomena on a 
large scale.&quot;Margaret--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Nathan Sharman

This whole radio and spirit voices, could be a MASSIVE&gt; HOAX, 
perpetuated by some one with a sophisticated&gt; multi-transmission two 
way radio.&gt; &gt; Think about it.&gt; &gt; THAT IS WHY I USE EVPmaker only to 
commuincate with&gt; the other dimension.&gt; &gt;
