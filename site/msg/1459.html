<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It doesn&#x27;t sound boring to many of us that follow your work. Those of 
us that believe in this ongoing project like to spend time not only 
keeping up with the development of the Box, but also listening 
closely to the output. A bar graph display is a nice addition. -Bill

&gt; This is the sweep board that goes with the newest tuner/audio 
board. I made 
&gt; one change not shown, I&#x27;m using a bargraph display for the tuning 
voltage 
&gt; instead of a meter(I had one in the junk box). So for the 
newest &quot;proto 
&gt; type&quot; there is two schematics, sweep, and the tuner. This system is 
much 
&gt; more complicated than I would like, and it still makes it look like 
exotic 
&gt; technology, it is in fact, just a radio, and the tuning system.
&gt; 
&gt; I was curious in setting up this latest sweep board, something 
changed, I no 
&gt; longer could use the pull down resistors to compensate for the DC 
offset 
&gt; from the op amps. I used only one pull down on the RVG pulse amp.
&gt; 
&gt; I used the tantalum capacitors in the white noise amp, the 
advantage being a 
&gt; faster start up time. Larger aluminum caps can be used, such as 
100uf-16volt 
&gt; caps. It takes about 20 seconds for the white noise to come up, and 
it still 
&gt; takes one minute before the VT signals comes on. On the other hand, 
the 
&gt; linear sweep is on as soon as power is turned on, and with this 
sweep 
&gt; version, the triangle is on all the time, so modes can be switched 
wihtout 
&gt; the warm up period.
&gt; 
&gt; This is how I spend my hoildays----but boring!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; FYI---- Mine!  I don&#x27;t have a usable system to run sessions on, I 
keep 
&gt; giving them away! Besides, I&#x27;d like to keep the first home made 
AM/FM tuner 
&gt; board.
