&gt; Hi Jeremy.  My site is www.ITCdeadpeople.com
&gt; 
&gt; It&#x27;s just 5 pages, really simply, but on page one there&#x27;s a link to
some EVP I&#x27;ve posted on 
&gt; putfile, and on page 2, there&#x27;s links at the bottom on the left,
explaining how to do my ITC 
&gt; method, and on the right to a Maury segment where some of my
material was used.

&gt; &gt; How cool. LOL.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I love it that she tattled on the dog. Rofl.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you have a website, I would love to see your ITC photos of animals.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That is so awesome. I feel that our family and friends take care of
&gt; &gt; our pet babies when they go to the Other Side.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My friend that came through on the EVP on Sunday was such a wonderful
&gt; &gt; woman. She loved animals like I do. She owned a Bakery and lived
&gt; &gt; across the street from me for years. The dog that my first wife and I
&gt; &gt; had at that time was a Scottish Terrier named Abbra (Her official name
&gt; &gt; was Aberdeen, as in the Scottish town) anyway, I used to hear Jean
&gt; &gt; talking and I would look out the window and there she would be,
&gt; &gt; sneaking snacks to Miss Abbra who needed bakery snacks about like I
&gt; &gt; do. LOL. Thats when we figured out why Miss Abbra wasn&#x27;t losing weight
&gt; &gt; on her new diet. LOL.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Blessings All,
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; That&#x27;s awesome, Jeremy.  I have some EVP of a woman talking to my
&gt; &gt; dog.  One time when I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; was recording, my dog (Kindred) started barking.  When I listened
&gt; &gt; back to the session (this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; was tradition EVP done in silence with a digital recorder) she had
&gt; &gt; said, &quot;Kindred.  What was 
&gt; &gt; &gt; that?&quot;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; In another, Kindred barks, then the woman says, &quot;Kindred.  She
&gt; &gt; thinks you&#x27;re sleeping.&quot;  I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; also have one of someone telling her &quot;NO&quot; and I really like the one
&gt; &gt; where someone tattles 
&gt; &gt; &gt; on her to me, &quot;Kindred&#x27;s headed for the dumpster.&quot;  LOL.  Just goes
&gt; &gt; to show you they are 
&gt; &gt; &gt; not only keeping an eye on us, but the animals too.  I think it&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; great that sometimes they 
&gt; &gt; &gt; are talking directly to the dog.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I only have one involving my cat, Kizmyt, where someone says, &quot;Stay
&gt; &gt; back&quot; (the cat had 
&gt; &gt; &gt; come into the room as I was recording).
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have gotten many ITC images of animals, so clearly they are an
&gt; &gt; important part of the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; spirit realm.  :-)  As well, I had animals come through during
&gt; &gt; sitting with a medium.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for sharing about your Molly EVP!  It made me smile.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello Again Margaret,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I forgot to tell you this earlier. Since you are also a dog
owner I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know you will appreciate this.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The day before yesterday I received an EVP. Male Voice.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He takes what sounds like a breath and says...Pooch. :)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I, of course always have Molly, my Jack Russell Terrier by my side
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when I record.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, I guess I have a Spirit Friend that loves animals too. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Grin.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take care.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many Blessings All,
