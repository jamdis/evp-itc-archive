I didn&#39;t have my regular speakers attached, but used a Radio Shack iSymphony T-Speaker, which I think accounts in part for the squeakiness.  I think the voice says &quot;It&#39;s dark.&quot; \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/It%27s%20dark.wav \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles\n\nRegards,\n\nrosemary_guiley &lt;reguiley@...&gt;"}
