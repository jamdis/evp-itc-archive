I&#39;m always in awe of people, such as yourself, who have this amazing \nunderstanding of electronics!  LOL- I could no more create and build a box than sprout \nwings and fly.  ;-)\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  Another board to test some ideas, like designing the board to fit a store bought \ncabinet, instead of making the board, and trying to come up with a box that it will fit in. \nThen while setting up the RF amp coil, I kept trying to find the signal peak, and kept \ntaking off turns. I could tell I was getting close, but the number of turns is almost half \nwhat I thought it should be, and what I had used in other radios. I must have been doing \nsomething wrong before, because I finally reached signal peak, or where the coil and the \ntuning diode resonate, at 66 turns of wire. I was using 110 turns on the coils, so the \nradios were not as sensitive as they could be. This one is just kick butt! and small, that&#39;s a \n9 volt battery for size comparison. Of course this is the radio/audio only board, sweep will \nbe on a secondary board. I also wanted to check the radio operation, as I want to turn this \none into a printed circuit board.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  BTW, I don&#39;t calculate the turns on the coils, they&#39;re from the junk box, so there&#39;s no \nway to tell the ferrite mix, so you can&#39;t calculate the number of turns for a certain \ninductance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get in touch in an instant.
