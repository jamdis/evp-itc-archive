It helps when they use a direct response or say your name. Its part  of why 
I prefer to use water method for my recordings, then there is no  deciding 
what is what. I suggest you start out recording short sessions.  I usually 
record sweep for about 3 minutes at most. With water its  always about 30 
seconds of recording time and that recording can contain  1-30 messages on -74 
speed. The speech is usually very very fast,  different vibration than we 
have and with water the speech is way  outside normal human speech rates.
 
Attaching a recent h2o clip it should come as attachment to those  getting 
individual emails. I dunno if you will hear this so I chose a  short one of 
someone saying "I spoke" to give you some idea of what I  mean. This is in 
the -74 speed range (slowed in audacity). Good  luck!

How does one tell which is only radio  stations going by and spirit chat?  
The channels go by so quickly  that it's hard to tell, even now on AM, I 
won't know what to cut,  maybe just try loading on a short tapping, but I got 
to learn how to  slow it down I guess.  Sounds like people having a party in 
the  back room, I had to turn it off.  I opened the door, and it was  quiet, 
when i walked in it was like hundreds of voices!  But,  this could only be 
radio channels, even the AM was just buzzing away  with them, the quietest 
was Short wave, very few words, then there  were a lot of Spanish people, 
don't know what they were talking about,  was a mess!
