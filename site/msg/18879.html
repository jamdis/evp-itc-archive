Tech David told me about this one guy over there, who always says one word, 
 that seems to be he only word he knows, its "hore."  Don't take it  
seriously because David the Tech, says that this fella is "sick in the head"  when 
he was a little boy women had rapped him and he was later murdered as a  
teen.  He grew up over there, however he is mental, and needs prayer he  
doesn't seem to have anyone to move him on.  David asked me to have you  folks 
all say a little prayer for Calib that he may get better over there, so he  
may move on, he is stuck in a partial dark plane because he has mind damage.
