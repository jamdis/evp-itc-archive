Thanks. ;)\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  I think before I ran a half mile of wire around the house, or up a \nmountain, I would make a simple loop antenna, about 2 feet square, \nand a half inch wide! Ya put the raidio near, or inside loop. I&#39;d use \na mechanical capacitor to peak the antenna for center band, or maybe \njust an area of the band where signals can be heard. Of course this \nis for AM only.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Helping your favorite cause is as easy as instant messaging.You \nIM, we give.\n&gt; http://im.live.com/Messenger/IM/Home/?source=text_hotmail_join\n&gt;"}
