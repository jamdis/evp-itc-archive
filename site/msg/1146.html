below is the key thing.  the phaselocked FM sweep happens with a CRACK that sounds like a .22 rifle and it starts just at the chaos point, just a little past optimum ordinary regeneration. you have to get there quick and stop quick or it wont work. a smaller tuning cap or 2 in series, or varicap would probably be easier.
   
  the chaos point is a very very good candidate for the appearance of otherworldly and reversed entropy effects according to the few multi phd'ed experts who have published anything on it.
   
  this narrowly focussed window also points up the many strengths and deficiencies of quantum mechanics in the middle range; at molecule sizes.  everything quits working like its supposed to.

  However, recent experiments have shown that the self quenched super regenerative circuit may be operated at a level -

   At these levels, something very interesting happens: A received narrow band FM (RF) signal can be set to heterodyne with the super regen detector's RF oscillations such that sum and difference frequencies are produced. The difference frequency, if close to the detector's quenching oscillation frequency, will lock onto and FM modulate the quench frequency. This produces a large variation in gain which exactly follows the FM modulation of the received signal. The gain variation creates a frequency to amplitude conversion (FM detection) of very high efficiency. To date, this effect has only been studied by electronics experimenters but could eventually lead to very high frequency, ultra low power FM receivers..."
