I just use the cut and try method for my stuff, there is no 
objective research to it. I am fascinated by the voices, and try 
everything I can to improve reception. I'm not all that concerned 
whether anyone accepts what I do or not. 

After eight years of doing this stuff, I have no idea how these 
voices are made. Nor do I see any self proclaimed experts out there 
that actually know anything about the paranormal, that makes us all 
about equal. 

I agree with banning those that insist on arguing, and name calling.
