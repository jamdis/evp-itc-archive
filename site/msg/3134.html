   Oh I see! Wi=
th the LM555 timer, you can a add transistor to make a constant current sou=
rce on the threshold pin, and it puts out a linear ramp, but that only give=
s one way tuning on a radio, it'll sweep up the band, then reset to the beg=
inning of the band, instead of going back down the band. I don't think that=
's usable for my purposes. I use a square wave that goes through an integra=
tor to convert it a triangle, so the voltage sweeps up smoothly, then back =
down smoothly. It's possible to run op amps on a single supply with some bi=
asing tricks. I might try that combined with the square wave output of a 55=
5. The goal being to get rid of one of the battery packs. I use gel cells, =
which have significant weight, and cost.
   
   Random mode is problematic,=
 unstable, and doesn't seem to work compared to the linear mode. Curious th=
at it worked ok when that's all I had, now I can't get that mode to work wi=
th any of my new boxes. Random in the new box would not work at the Stanely=
. Some have requested I leave it in, but it's just not worth the headache. =

   
   The system can be simplified, like leave out the mic amps, and soun=
d chamber, providing only a line output to go to a recorder, and speaker dr=
iver. It's been my experience recently that spirits do not need the sound c=
hamber(aka echo box), and recording directly from a swept tuner works just =
fine, and results in possibly clearer communications. There's less places t=
o introduce distortion and noise. Random results in broken up voices and ph=
rases, and longer broadcast fragments. With good conditions, linear provide=
s longer phrases, and more coherent messages. The "good conditions" being s=
imilar to radio propogation", in that sonmetimes it's good, and clear, and =
other times it's not. There seems to be a three month cycle in the propogat=
ion effects, but I have nothing documented. 
   
   There is yet another me=
thod of raw audio, use a foreign language shortwave broadcast that you don'=
t understand. Announce you're doing an EVP recording, and record some of th=
e  broadcast.  On playback there should be coherent, and meaningful message=
s in your language.  Curiously, people that speak whatever language you use=
 don't hear the messages. You could even use stuff off the web, like Chines=
e news or whatever. This stuff is trickier, cuz some of what is heard could=
 be a trick of the mind, but that's true with any method. I did use this up=
 hunting last year, and the other guys could hear the messages I was gettin=
g using Chinese shortwave--they also heard the english messages mixed in wi=
th Chinese. It's not just the occasional word that sounds like English, it'=
s coherent phrases with meaning to the person doing the recording. I wonder=
 if our minds don't use thiese raw audio methods as a psychic prop to get t=
he information to the surface?
