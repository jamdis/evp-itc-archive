<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>FYI all, that&#x27;s not the same RJ-- I don&#x27;t think! We had a skepdork that
went by RJ, did no recordings of his own, could accept no evidence,
disregarded all other researchers work and then presummed to tell us what
was really going on with EVP. I finally got fed up and kicked his ass off.

&gt; There&#x27;s still time to submit answers for Experiment 4. Is anything you&#x27;re
&gt; doing related to that?
