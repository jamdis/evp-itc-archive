Count me in on the test. By the way, some here might\nbe interested in knowing that the American Association of EVP did a\nsimilar blind test and their results showed about a 33% hit rate for\npeople getting the same words from a file. That would be a pretty\ngood number to match, I would think. Sarcasum can be an effective way\nto make things happen at times.And that&#39;s not being sarcastic.\nlol ron\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Reality Is Your Idea\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 1/17/09, nightparanormalrese arch &lt;nightparanormalrese\narch@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: nightparanormalrese arch &lt;nightparanormalrese arch@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Need volenters for validation experiment\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; Date: Saturday, January 17, 2009, 7:40 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Reading the posts from the last week as I do every sat morning it is my \n&gt; opinion that some of them have a very polite condescending tone to \n&gt; them.This group and the people in it have always been very helpful and \n&gt; a joy to do research with I hope it stays that way I would hate to see \n&gt; it become one of &quot;those&quot; boards if you know what I mean (my 1 cent had \n&gt; to do it). so anyway\n&gt; One productive idea that I saw from one of this weeks posts was to send \n&gt; the same file privitly to a few people and see what they hear in it. \n&gt; Unpromtide by file names or other posts about it. I have a couple files \n&gt; that I feel are pretty clear. So if you would like to volunteer just \n&gt; send me an email with your email adress and I will send you a file not \n&gt; too long but it will be unedited and in its original form.\n&gt; I will not amplify it or edit or change it in anyway from its original. \n&gt; Those who recive the files do the same NO editing untill you render \n&gt; your opinion to me about it after that you can do what u like with it.\n&gt; Remember after listening email me DO NOT post what you hear on the \n&gt; board I will do that later when I have everyones opinion.\n&gt; Mike W\n&gt; nightparanormalrese arch@yahoo. com\n&gt;"}
