<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Fair enough. I understand experiences that defy all attempts at Earth logic, as it were. I&#x27;ve had them, too.

As I said, just food for thought.

&gt;Ann,
&gt;
&gt;Without knowing me, I can understand your offering of other possible
&gt;causes of my experience. As investigators, that is our obligation; to
&gt;look for all possible causes of supposed paranormal phenomenon. I am
&gt;sure that I would have the same reaction as you after having read
&gt;about the experience. I have found that the investigators I respect
&gt;the most are those with the ability to be skeptical. I train my new
&gt;members to be objective.
&gt;
&gt;Now, all that being said... I won&#x27;t attempt to try to persuade you to
&gt;believe that my story is exactly what happened. I can&#x27;t and don&#x27;t feel
&gt;a need to. I know that any story related by anyone can fall into the
&gt;symptoms you state below, including your own. I can only offer you the
&gt;following to consider;
&gt;
&gt;I am a 40 year old educated and intelligent female. I am not now, nor
&gt;have I ever been in treatment for or taken medication for mental
&gt;illness. I have never experienced a panic attack. I do not use drugs.
&gt;I am not given to flights of fancy and am described as analytical and
&gt;pragmatic. I have been fully involved in the field for 6 years. That
&gt;night was the first and only time I ever experienced what I did. I do
&gt;not scare. I run towards noises, shadows etc. I am a trusted sensitive
&gt;with enough validation to discredit even my own hard core skepticism.I
&gt;am objective. 
&gt;
&gt;Now that the majority of a witness interview is complete LOL, I am
&gt;done with the post.  
&gt;

&gt;&gt; Thank you for sharing that so honestly with me. I really appreciate
&gt;it. :)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Let me give you my comments, none of which are meant to belittle
&gt;your experience, rather to provide food for thought: I am sure that
&gt;the feelings you experienced (&quot;I began to feel what I can only
&gt;describe as &quot;thick&quot; energy move into my hand, up my arm, through my
&gt;chest and then settle into my stomach...It began to churn and move up
&gt;into my throat..I felt paralyzed. ...It took approximately 30 minutes
&gt;before I felt myself again,&quot;) were very real to you. You said you
&gt;thought it was evil; that your vomit would be black (an image straight
&gt;out of classic demonolgy). Indeed, you said that everyone in the room
&gt;had the similar mindset: Whatever you there to confront was
&gt;dark/negative/evil.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Speaking from my own personal experience, I have seen groups of
&gt;people involved in the paranormal convince themselves of similar (and
&gt;many far, far weirder) things. Hell, as a teen, I was involved in
&gt;several of these folies-a-deux (or 10, 15, 20, or more). I saw people
&gt;having experiences similar to what you report. At one point, friends
&gt;of mine were receiving alledged telepathic communication from a living
&gt;rock star who was helping them commune with spirit of Alisdar Crowley,
&gt;for example. Others in the group or on its periphery were getting
&gt;&quot;attacked&quot; by what we called AWOLs (from &quot;Away Without Leave&quot;). Hell,
&gt;I thought I&#x27;d been attacked by a few myself. But now, many years
&gt;later, what I see this particular group, and others, was comprised of
&gt;was a lot of people damned busy scaring the shit out of themselves.
&gt;Maybe real dark forces *were* feeding off the bad vibes--I dunno. But
&gt;what I witnessed is rendolent of the Salem hysteria in the late 1600s,
&gt;the &quot;Amityville Horror&quot; case, and many, many others, in descending
&gt;order of sensationalism, down to the ubiquitous freakouts of kids
&gt;playing with the Ouija board.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Fear and anxiety produce painful and uncomfortabl physical effects
&gt;in the body that could be interpreted as caused by a negative outside
&gt;influence. Fear causes the body to become flooded with hormones
&gt;(particularly adrenalin). Here is a list of symptoms (from Wikipedia)
&gt;of what we commonly call a panic attack:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Physical
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;     * An extremely unpleasant sensation of adrenaline over the
&gt;entire body
&gt;&gt;     * Sweating
&gt;&gt;     * Shortness of breath
&gt;&gt;     * Racing or pounding heartbeat or palpitations
&gt;&gt;     * Chest pain
&gt;&gt;     * Dizziness or vertigo
&gt;&gt;     * Lightheadedness
&gt;&gt;     * Nausea / stomach pains
&gt;&gt;     * Hyperventilation
&gt;&gt;     * Choking or smothering sensations
&gt;&gt;     * Uncontrollable itching
&gt;&gt;     * Tingling or numbness in the hands, face, feet or mouth
&gt;(paresthesia)
&gt;&gt;     * Hot/cold flashes
&gt;&gt;     * Trembling or shaking
&gt;&gt;     * Feeling of claustrophobia
&gt;&gt;     * Exhaustion
&gt;&gt;     * Feeling of physical weakness or limpness of the body
&gt;&gt;     * Uncontrollable crying
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Mental
&gt;&gt;     * Loss of the ability to react logically to stimuli
&gt;&gt;     * Loss of cognitive ability in general
&gt;&gt;     * Racing thoughts (often based on fear; a repeated or illogical
&gt;worry)
&gt;&gt;     * Loud internal dialogue
&gt;&gt;     * Feeling of impending doom
&gt;&gt;     * Feeling of &quot;going crazy&quot;
&gt;&gt;     * Extreme worried feeling
&gt;&gt;     * Feeling of extreme nervousness
&gt;&gt;     * Feeling out of control
&gt;&gt;     * Feeling of Threatening
&gt;&gt;     * Feeling of anti-social behaviour from other people
&gt;&gt;     * Feeling of excitement
&gt;&gt;     * Feeling of nagging from other people
&gt;&gt;     * Vision is somewhat impaired (eyes may feel like they are shaking.)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Emotional
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;     * Terror, or a sense that something unimaginably horrible is
&gt;about to occur and one is powerless to prevent it
&gt;&gt;     * Fear that the panic is a symptom of a serious illness
&gt;&gt;     * Fear of losing control
&gt;&gt;     * Fear of death
&gt;&gt;     * Fear of going crazy
&gt;&gt;     * Flashbacks to earlier panic trigger
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;  Perceptual
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;     * Tunnel vision
&gt;&gt;     * Heightened senses
&gt;&gt;     * The apparent slowing down or speeding up of time
&gt;&gt;     * Dream-like sensation or perceptual distortion (derealization)
&gt;&gt;     * Dissociation, or the perception that one is not connected to
&gt;the body or is disconnected from space and time (depersonalization)
&gt;&gt;     * Feeling of loss of free will, as if acting entirely
&gt;automatically without control
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have to submit that the symptoms you describe for yourself and
&gt;others involved that night are found on this list. In fact, a lot of
&gt;descriptions of &quot;attacks by dark forces&quot; sound like the physiological
&gt;effects of fear and anxiety. Am I saying you had a panic attack? No.
&gt;But I am suggesting it is a possibility to consider. Because you were
&gt;in a situation where you believed that &quot;evil&quot; would be present, thus
&gt;generating fear, Occam&#x27;s Razor would certainly lead us to conclude
&gt;that adrenaline that made you feel the way you did. But Occam&#x27;s Razor
&gt;proves it&#x27;s general trustworthines by periodic exceptions.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; HMO and not an attack or judgement on your (or anyone&#x27;s) beliefs,
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Negative Experience
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Ann,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;I tried to relocate the post in which you asked me about my negative
&gt;&gt; &gt;experiences. After 10 minutes searching... new topic.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;As it relates to the box, I really only have two personal experiences
&gt;&gt; &gt;that might be considered negative. 
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;The first one is contained in a posting I just made prior to this. I
&gt;&gt; &gt;will refer you back to it, if you don&#x27;t mind. The experience is
&gt;&gt; &gt;contained in the copy and paste from my April 17, 2007 blog. It did
&gt;&gt; &gt;not effect me personally  but I did witness the effects of negative
&gt;&gt; &gt;energy on what/who came through the box. 
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;The second negative experience is one I have not spoken of to anyone
&gt;&gt; &gt;besides who was there that day and one close trusted friend. This
&gt;&gt; &gt;occurred in September of this year:
&gt;&gt; &gt;Chris, myself and four others who will remain nameless, were gathered
&gt;&gt; &gt;in a hotel room. For the sake of the story, I will refer to the main
&gt;&gt; &gt;subject as Mary. 
&gt;&gt; &gt;Mary had been experiencing severe negative phenomenon for years. This
&gt;&gt; &gt;included poltergeist type activity, personal harm and had since moved
&gt;&gt; &gt;into effecting her young son. I can not get into the exact details of
&gt;&gt; &gt;this negativity but suffice it to say that all accounts led everyone
&gt;&gt; &gt;to believe that Mary was dealing with a demon or demons. 
&gt;&gt; &gt;This was the second time Mary had sought out Chris for assistance. 
&gt;&gt; &gt;The first time she had noticed a change for a short time but then
&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;things&quot; had returned as before and in some instances had worsened.
&gt;&gt; &gt;This particular day Mary found herself surrounded by trusted friends
&gt;&gt; &gt;and was ready to try again. There was a psychic medium, a healer and,
&gt;&gt; &gt;myself, a sensitive along with another person with no stated
&gt;&gt; &gt;abilities. Our goal was to turn on the box and receive some direction
&gt;&gt; &gt;about what to do and how to help. I won&#x27;t reveal the details of what
&gt;&gt; &gt;was said as they are not relevant to the post topic. 
&gt;&gt; &gt;As some time went on and we moved into a second session with the box,
&gt;&gt; &gt;Chris became noticeably weaker. It was obvious that his energy was
&gt;&gt; &gt;being used. I noticed that I was becoming quite weepy. You&#x27;ll have to
&gt;&gt; &gt;take my word on this when I say I am not a weepy person. Sensitive or
&gt;&gt; &gt;not, I do not become emotional. Yet as time passed, I found I couldn&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; &gt;control the tears falling. I rationalized it by recognizing I was
&gt;&gt; &gt;probably becoming emotional with compassion as Mary discussed very
&gt;&gt; &gt;private issues. 
&gt;&gt; &gt;The psychic medium present told us at this point that we should place
&gt;&gt; &gt;our hands on Mary. Not considering that I was in no state to offer
&gt;&gt; &gt;energy/help to anyone, I placed my hand on Mary&#x27;s leg. Suddenly, I
&gt;&gt; &gt;began to feel what I can only describe as &quot;thick&quot; energy move into my
&gt;&gt; &gt;hand, up my arm, through my chest and then settle into my stomach. As
&gt;&gt; &gt;it sat in my stomach I could literally feel it turn into sludge. It
&gt;&gt; &gt;began to churn and move up into my throat. At this point, I knew I was
&gt;&gt; &gt;going to vomit and I knew it would be black. I knew this was evil.
&gt;&gt; &gt;Fortunately, some focus switched to me at this point because I felt
&gt;&gt; &gt;paralyzed. I was removed from the room and brought outside where, with
&gt;&gt; &gt;assistance, I was able to let go of what was not mine. It took
&gt;&gt; &gt;approximately 30 minutes before I felt myself again.
&gt;&gt; &gt;Back to Mary for a moment; After the sessions that night, she had a
&gt;&gt; &gt;noticeable physical change, in particular to her face. It shocked me.
&gt;&gt; &gt;Where she had appeared hard or almost calloused in her expressions,
&gt;&gt; &gt;she was now much softer in appearance. Her life improved dramatically.
&gt;&gt; &gt;She has had one more session with Chris and the box and things
&gt;&gt; &gt;continue to improve.
&gt;&gt; &gt;The TTTD or Frank&#x27;s Box or whatever you want to refer to it as, is a
&gt;&gt; &gt;powerful device. It has the ability to connect to other dimensions. It
&gt;&gt; &gt;can be a wonderful thing. It can also be quite scary in the wrong
&gt;&gt; &gt;hands. I believe that just as good can be called upon to help, so can
&gt;&gt; &gt;dark and we know that there are many people out there who are far more
&gt;&gt; &gt;concerned in working with lower levels than the higher.
