<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>If it is in fact a cease-and-desist notice from Radio Shack, it 
wouldn&#x27;t be the first time they (RS) have done this.  I receieved a 
cease-and-desist notice from Radio Shack many years ago when I was 
modifying their radio scanner products and posting them on the web.  
Guess what... if you go to scanshack.com you can still see step-by-
step instructions on how I modified their scanners, with detailed 
drawings I did.
They (RS/Tandy at that time) lost that battle with me, or I should 
say their lawyer lost that battle with me.
But, as you said... we shall wait and see what is up with this issue.

&gt; Judy, and everyone else, too--please don&#x27;t promote or continue 
this  
&gt; until we hear from Sum. This may not be what everyone is assuming 
at  
&gt; all. My concern is that he has received a cease-and-desist notice  
&gt; from Radio Shack, which may have been informed that someone was  
&gt; promoting their product in a way not in compliment with their  
&gt; corporate image, and that his counsel is advising he comply with 
it.  
&gt; What you are telling people to do may be exactly what his own 
legal  
&gt; counsel is advising against and may put him in a precarious 
situation.
&gt; 
&gt; Please just calm down and don&#x27;t make assumption until he can 
clarify  
&gt; for us. If it comes down to someone making personal threats 
against  
&gt; him, that&#x27;s a whole other matter. But he needs to ask for help 
before  
&gt; everyone goes all posse, OK?
