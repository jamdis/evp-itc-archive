This was captured on a digital voice recorder while I\n&gt; was heating coffee in the microwave oven nearby, and I felt that the\n&gt; microwave must have been a powerful energy source for the &quot;speaker.&quot;\n&gt; It may be important to note that I had just invited spirits inside\n&gt; the house from outside, and that after I listened to this message I\n&gt; told them to go back outside because they were too rude to continue\n&gt; talking to.

Robin, I am\n&gt; glad to hear that the protection ritual will be utilized by you in\n&gt; the purpose it was intended. To give any individual that wants to\n&gt; anopportunity to use it. You will find many forms of interaction on\n&gt; this group, running the gamut from total agreement to calm\n&gt; debate /discussion. To full blown arguments. That is what makes a\n&gt; group, If everyone followed one single ideology and the ideas of any\n&gt; single person without questionit would not be a group it would be a\n&gt; cult. Welcome to the wonderful world of box research robin, I&#39;m sure\n&gt; you will be a valued member and researcher in this community.

When I first started recording EVP a couple of\n&gt; years ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when it\n&gt; happened to me I felt elated rather than frightened or distressed. I\n&gt; will ask again: What physical or psychic harm is a disembodied\n&gt; entity capable of doing? Please listen to the one EVP I&#39;ve posted on\n&gt; this board and tell me what, if anything, you hear. I know what I\n&gt; hear, and I consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is the\n&gt; response that has created the determination in me to continue\n&gt; researching the unknown.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings. I only want to learn as\n&gt; much as I can from you and the other dedicated researchers on this\n&gt; board. It never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in the\n&gt; past, and that&#39;s about all I can say. I will probably use one from\n&gt; this point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract\n&gt; goodness.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, thank you for this contribution. I think the debate has been\n&gt; an excellent one, and I&#39;ve appreciated the opportunity to be\n&gt; enlightened.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Robin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: bhali333\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 16, 2008 8:06 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debate\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I swore I would not get wraped up in this debateBUT!The reason I\n&gt; came up with this whole protection ritual was that some of the new\n&gt; researchers whereexpressing a rational concern for negative responces\n&gt; that they were recieving through thier boxes.The short protection\n&gt; ritual that I posted is not meant to quell irrational histerical\n&gt; fear, and I agreewith rosemary that anyone suffering from such fear\n&gt; should rethink thier involment in the paranormal research field.that\n&gt; being said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal comfort to\n&gt; those new individuals that had never expperienced spiritual\n&gt; negativity. And to help ease them into aproaching a session\n&gt; eventually with confidenceand determination as well as full\n&gt; curiousity for all types of the communication we recieve.My initial\n&gt; post of the ritual file was done with the best of intentions and\n&gt; meant to be another tool available for those who felt they needed or\n&gt; wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer ritual, I don&#39;t\n&gt; think it is really worthy of all this debate.Use it, don&#39;t use it.\n&gt; It&#39;s there if you want it. Also I must say there are two kinds of\n&gt; fear the kind that is natural and a god given emotion for self\n&gt; preservation, ie the fright and flight reflex that is an instinctive\n&gt; trait in all of us. Then you have the irrational dibilitating phobic\n&gt; fear that can turn an individual into a frozen statue. That type of\n&gt; fear I believe is unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt with and\n&gt; learned how to harness. I also believe that anyone that harbors that\n&gt; type of fear would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a\n&gt; case of such fear it would already be present and doing a small\n&gt; protection ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take it for\n&gt; what it is, something to utilize in our box of tools like an emf\n&gt; meter.you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the bottom of\n&gt; your tool box at home that you inherited from your grandfather and\n&gt; have never usedbut if you come across that odd nut that needs\n&gt; tightening somedsy you will be glad you have it.Bruce\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Need to know the score, the latest news, or you need your Hotmail®-\n&gt; get your &quot;fix&quot; Check it out.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Climb to the top of the charts!
