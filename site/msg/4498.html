Yeah, I think this file is kinda funny.  The 470 is Joel's box, and when I first turned it on, it kept asking for Joel and Jeff (Jeff picked it up for us).  It seemed that the first 3 minutes was nothing but questions from the otherside as to why I had Joel & Jeff's box.  It was almost that I needed to get permission to use it, LOL.  I think they were giving Joel attitude for not doing his sessions everyday like I was and the fact that maybe if he conducted more sessions that he would know if his tec was assigned.  
   
  I love their sense of humor!!!
