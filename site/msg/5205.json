She \nhad come up with the idea of running the RS 469 through a telivision \nset via audio cables with the red and white conectors at one end and a \n3.5 mm jack at the other.\n\njust plug the red and whote plugs into the corresponding audio in or \nvideo in ports on your tv. switch the tv to video as if you where using \na dvd player or video game console and turn on the RS box.\n\nThis will run the RS signal through the tv, Juli has had better \nreception using this method. Give it a try and let us know how it goes.\n\nBruce"}
