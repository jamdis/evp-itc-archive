<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I totally agree. I also like science to back up my experiences as much  
as possible instead of assumptions as &quot;fact&quot;.

I grow weary of the ego that I see in this field of research. People  
feeling their have some special gift to &quot;free trapped souls&quot; or assume  
they&#x27;re even trapped. I asked my &quot;house spirits&quot; (their term not mine)  
if they were &quot;trapped&quot; and they thought that was ridiculous. I have a  
feeling we&#x27;re much more trapped than they are. ;) I was informed some  
are around all the time and some just visit. Who am I to argue or  
assume different? I&#x27;m only an audio observer.I&#x27;m in a fleshy avatar  
that needs glasses/contacts to even see across the room. Am I to  
assume with my incredibly limited current situation of being in a body  
that I am equipped to help those who are free from such a limitation?  
lol! I think not!

Due to my past experiences, I have a very deep faith that all is taken  
care of. Both here and in other realms/dimensions by an Intelligence a  
lot bigger than all of us. For me to assume that that power that some  
call &quot;God&quot;- &quot;Buddha&quot;- &quot;Allah&quot;- [Insert Higher Power here] isn&#x27;t taking  
care of things, or that energies/souls stay stuck, for me, and in my  
experience is absurd. I not only heard, but spoke with an entity named  
&quot;Lisa&quot; who said that there were people assigned to those coming over  
(passing from our earthly realm). This is exactly what I&#x27;ve  
experienced myself in my own passing. Our relatives, pets, and other  
energies come for us in my experience. I&#x27;ve also sat with those who  
crossed over and know those gone before them came for them as they  
said so before passing.

My NDE&#x27;s were incredibly positive. I&#x27;ll always be grateful for those  
experiences as they keep my mind open to anything/any experience.  
Beautiful beyond words.

&gt; I&#x27;m not really a big fan of mediums &quot;freeing&quot; trapped souls. I think  
&gt; it says more about the medium than the soul. That&#x27;s my opinion and  
&gt; I&#x27;ve had a lot of years in parapsychology to form it. I&#x27;m not trying  
&gt; to ruffle anyone&#x27;s feathers. I haven&#x27;t been posting here a lot for a  
&gt; while, so you don&#x27;t know me. Really, I am not ever disrespecting  
&gt; anyone&#x27;s opinion, just disgreeing with it. :)

&gt;
&gt; What you write about the Gettysburg hauntings is speculation that I  
&gt; agree with, but I still don&#x27;t see any connection to the Fish Group  
&gt; and NDEs.
