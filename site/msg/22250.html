Since spirit's talk very fast, it is hard to hear them speak,  this file,  
I did not slow it down because I did not want to mess it up, be  assured 
this is, My own mother's voice, she says, "Bonnie" then I hear a man's voice 
say,  and almost on top or right after her's saying, her name,  "Elaine"  and 
then when I reverse the file, the man says,  "Your mom," then,  "loves you"  
but as I said before  it is a very fast, and I did not want to slow it down 
for fear, it might be  ruined.  Isn't it nice to know, we all live on?  You 
may need to put  more length to it, something I probably should have done 
at least since it is so  fast. God Bless you all, sf
