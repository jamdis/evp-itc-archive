<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just wanted to say hello to the group and that I am very happy to be a part of this community.

My name is Phil and I&#x27;ve been doing research (in and out of the field) into the paranormal for several years.  

As it stands I&#x27;m looking to expand my knowledge and technical base in EVP research.

I&#x27;ve done some searching through the board and files here and I have found myself somewhat perplexed by the variety of different boxes and hacks available.

I would much appreciate it if someone could point me in the direction of a good box schematic to build that&#x27;s relatively reliable (doesn&#x27;t have to be bleeding edge or anything) and somewhat current.  

Is it best to grab one of the box schematics floating around or is a RS Hack the way to begin?  And which schematic/hack would be best to start with?

I apologize for the completely bland question, but it&#x27;s difficult to decipher what&#x27;s current and what is not and what&#x27;s best to start with through the posts I&#x27;ve found up to this point.

I appreciate any and all help anyone could offer and I look forward to getting to you all and working with the community.

Thanks,
-Phil</pre>
