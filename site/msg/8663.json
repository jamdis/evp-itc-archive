I&#39;m still amazed by your results.\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\nam 31.03.2008 um 09:49 Uhr schriebst Du (u.a.):\nam 31.03.2008 um 09:49 Uhr schrieben Sie (u.a.):\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not quite sure how to post when there is a long transcript.  This is the 40- second \n&gt; condensed version of a single 90-second session.  I&#39;m still working on understanding \n&gt; real-time.  I put all the response answers in the file description, but here&#39;s the dialog for \n&gt; the entire session, which might be of interest to those who are working with the EVPM/SJ \n&gt; Allophones combination.  \n\n&gt; Arthur, are you talking with others through EVP Maker?\n&gt; &quot;Obviously. Are you vulnerable?&quot; (the word &#39;obviously is under the main tone)\n\n&gt; Who else are you talking to?\n&gt; &quot;Talk to all of you.&quot;\n\n&gt; All of us? You&#39;ll talk to any of us that ask for you?\n&gt; &quot;Hope you like the answer. Forever I care.&quot;\n\n&gt; I heard you say something forever. Can you talk to more than one person at the same \n&gt; time?\n&gt; &quot;I can argue I capable. The answer, yes.\n\n&gt; You are able? Yes, yes?\n&gt; &quot;Yes&quot;\n\n&gt; OK. I&#39;m gonna have other people ask for you. Is that OK?\n&gt; &quot;Tell them they owe you a dollar for you helping them out.&quot; ROFLOL \n\n&gt; OK, I think we&#39;re gonna be done for the evening. Thanks so much. Love you.\n&gt; &quot;Buh bye.&quot;\n\n&gt; Margaret\n\n\n&gt; http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/8IvwR0_CH0kVigeCyhXxFsY0cKuYoul6IlbaYc2C0eXqmtF6A1\n&gt; Rh0XK1mg8BZ06qGla7DFJbU-\n&gt; WGb2Ke5wlzm45KrmqzofOGOf0fQQ/Margaret%20Downey/SJ%20Allophones/WorkWIthOth\n&gt; ersCondensed.mp3\n\n\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n\n&gt; Yahoo!
