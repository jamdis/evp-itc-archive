Snowfire, as I noted at the beginning of the test, sending in results after=
 I already announced what the object is can't of course be part of the expe=
riment.=C2=A0 Someone could simply read what I said, and it could then infl=
uence their own interpretation of ramdom noise, for example, or they could =
say "I got it but forgot to mail it", or a host of other reasons.

To make =
the experiment as objective as possible, only answers sent during the exper=
iment's timeframe can be valid.

Thanks aga=
in for everyone who participated! I admire your 
            courage and mo=
tivation to try different methods, see what works, and 
            try to =
improve everyone's understanding of EVP-ITC.

If you 
            recall, o=
n 7/10/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer 
            monitor, =
right in front of me, and left it there until today, 
            7/14/2010=
, noon Denver time. The experiment was for participants to 
            det=
ermine what it was. Vague or partial answers wouldn't be counted 
         =
   (for example, just colors, shapes, sizes, what it's made of, etc): 
    =
        we're looking for what it is. Participants could use their ghost 
 =
           boxes, EVP recorders, or I suppose any other means they 
       =
     chose.

In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the 
         =
   object at the start of the experiment and loaded it to the Files 
      =
      section (RJ folder) of this group. If you can follow the link, it is =

            here:

http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ 
            EVP-=
ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710. 1.zip

The idea was that 
            you could =
download the file at the beginning of the test, and 'keep 
            it s=
afe' on your computer. Then at the end of the test, I would 
            re=
lease the password so you could reveal the contents of the file. 
         =
   That way, you were in control of the original image during the 
        =
    entire test, not me. 

The password for that file is: 
            123B=
lastOff
Instructions, if you need them, are also in that RJ 
            fo=
lder.

And if you did not care to download the zip file 
            before=
 the test, I will post the final image there too.

So to 
            the r=
esults:

Number of participants: 5
Total tries: 
            8
Ambiguous an=
swers: 0
Correct answers: 0

Object: A 
            radio
Uzipped picture:
=
http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ 
            EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.201=
00710. 1.JPG

So what do the 
            results mean? All that we can rea=
lly agree on from this experiment 
            is that no participant, with=
 whatever theories or methods or 
            technology they used, was abl=
e to correctly determine the object. We 
            can't say those theori=
es or methods or technologies never work. Just 
            as we can't say=
 they do. Just that, for whatever reason, they did 
            not work th=
is time. Readers can take the results, use them to 
            improve or =
change their methods, or keep doing what they're 
            doing.

If an=
yone has any observations, comments, or ideas for 
            improvement,=
 let me know. I hope to get a new experiment up and 
            running so=
on. Since there wasn't much participation Mon-Wed, I think 
            the=
 next experiment will be arranged to mostly span the 
            weekends.=


Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this 
            first exp=
eriment.
