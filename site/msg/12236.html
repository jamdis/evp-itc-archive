&gt; I am so sorry Tammi I know you and your family must be devastated. 
I send much love and light your way to guide you!!!
&gt; 
&gt; And a simple warning. This is quite a large group of genuine 
helpful people however there are a few out there (you know who you 
are I wont name names) who think its ok to charge people money to do 
a session for them in thier time of grief so please ignore anyone who 
would even think about trying to solicit you or gain a profit off it. 
&gt; 
&gt; I personally frown upon that tactic.
&gt; 
&gt; There are also many caring individuals in the community who may 
step forward to try and be of assistance. At no charge. Just hoping 
anything could help your family. 
&gt; 
&gt; HUGGGZZZ
&gt;
