<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, the weather can be weird to AM, i was trying out a different 
box yesterday.  I picked up an old style 12-469 that seems to work 
similar to the old style 470, but every one i get seems to have a 
varying AM signal.  Some RS boxes are louder than others on AM, maybe 
it&#x27;s how many times the wire is wrapped around the AM coil.  I sit 
them side by side and get different signals....pretty weird.  I was 
in a location last week with all the boxes and the only one that got 
a signal with was frank&#x27;s box, i can&#x27;t explain that either.  How can 
i get different AM signals with different boxes...it&#x27;s still AM right?
