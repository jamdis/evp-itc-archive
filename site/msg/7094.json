Bruce should have  \nbeen asked to apologize and Laura should have taken ownership of her  \ncomment and apologized, too. (She later chose to apologize for using  \nthe word &quot;balls,&quot; which was so very clearly not at all the issue.)  \nInstead, Bruce was cut off so that he couldn&#39;t apologize. You can  \nargue semantics with me all day, but suspension of posting rights and  \nbanning are *effectively* the same thing. No incoming communication.  \nAnd I know that I can leave if I don&#39;t like it, but I can continue to  \npost if I am a good girl.\n\nAnd there it remains, and shall, I think.\n\nAnn\n\nOn Feb 11, 2008, at 10:28 AM, Frank Ratka wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Just and FYI on the conflict of interest idea.
