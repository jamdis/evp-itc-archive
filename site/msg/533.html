        I am sorry but I dont know/remember who hes here for. Might be someone from the other group. I had these messages come through before listening to others recordings when I was a member there and I cant remember who it was but it was important to someone off the board at the time. But his name wasnt exactly Brandon it was something that sounds similar but I hear it as "Bran-den" while they hear it differently. So I am posting this here hoping it finds its way to his mother as well as forwarding this to anyone I think may remember. The part about a guest today for sumption makes me think its someone in this group but this group wasnt here when I had heard it last time. I dont know.
   
  I had a "pop in" from them during a session the other night but with all the drama things have been fuzzier so today I decided to use a newer method and I keep getting mom messages. I dont have any children so something tells me Brandon and his friend are back to let thier moms know they are around.
   
  Some of these are very hard to hear and I'd apologize if there was anything I could do about it but theres not so if nothing else take the message from the filename and leave it at that. Perhaps others will hear more than my ears do. It's always hard to say if anyone can hear the fuzzy ones.
   
  Some of the new session are clearer. Hopefully its a good sign that communication will improve soon. Its a method that only recently started working even tho they had me trying it for months with no results... so I dont use it often. 
   
  They were bugging me to contact Sonia Rinaldi again, but I still have no clue how to do that. At least this time I know shes a real person LOL. They want us to share methods/contacts. I been gettin those messages for like almost a year now and I havent bumped into her yet so I can only assume maybe the opportunity will present itself in the future. Until then I just post the info how I do stuff for anyone.
   
  I am not even sure she speaks english and they were speaking another language after they say her name and I cant understand it at all. So whatever it was it wasnt for my ears to understand.
