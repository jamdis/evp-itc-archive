I just think we don&#39;t  \n&gt; know who\n&gt; we&#39;re really comunicating with through the boxes. It could be space\n&gt; aliens for all we know. They definitely don&#39;t sound like the EVP&#39;s  \n&gt; I&#39;ve\n&gt; gotten in haunted places. They are in a class by themselves. Maybe  \n&gt; we&#39;ll\n&gt; know for sure some day.\n&gt;\n&gt; As for the loved ones, I personally think they hang around for the\n&gt; funeral, then they&#39;re off into a new baby body as fast as they can  \n&gt; go. The\n&gt; ones who hang around and become ghosts are probably in the less  \n&gt; than 1%\n&gt; category of people who do that. The rest are growing up with new  \n&gt; parents\n&gt; somewhere and getting to believe in Santa Claus (or whatever) again.\n&gt; :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Zack\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, 31 Dec 2007, Lisby wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps I should have been more specific.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ominous--in reference to the people speaking through the box not  \n&gt; being our\n&gt; &gt; loved ones who are &quot;somewhere else.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Dec 31, 2007, at 7:38 PM, Ken wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ominous?
