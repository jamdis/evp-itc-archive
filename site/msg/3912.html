What I find amazing is that you do not have to speak and the voices already know.  They even know the presents when one walks into a room.  My clips from yesterday I only ran 2 minutes and got 5 evp separate evps from that time.  
   
  I have been off all week and since my better half suprised me on Friday evening, I have not gotten a thing done.  I am lucky if I showered all week. LOL  
   
  I am working on ones from this mornings session and I brought up Frank and Bruce.  I got responses one even asked if Frank was here, I said I think hes at his home in Colorado.  I will try and get that up today.

  It does make you think.  My second voice had me asking, "Dad, are you here with me?" but you hear the clear-as-a-bell answer of "Here!" in MY OWN VOICE.  Some other experimenters have suggested that the entities make use of the fragments of our own questions to answer us. Fascinating.
   
  Hope you're well,
  Love,
  Ursula
