I have been following the Audio ITC of Debbie Caruso (www.listentothisforme.com/) and it seems like this is legitimate responses.\n\nAt times here all I hear is intelligible garbbled radio speak that people are interpreting as conversation.  As the radio scans you can easily confuse this garbled radio as messages from the beyond; however, if you get intelligent responses from some questions or conversation then you can reasonably state that it is a conversation from the beyond - as long as the conversation is enough to be able to make that claim.\n\nTo claim a binch of munged words from a series of radio stations is conversation without any real connection / q&a is really stretching it I think.  Again, I am not a skeptic, but I think fashioning conversation out of garbled words from radio stations is rediculous.\n\n\nDBMDude\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  I don&#39;t  ask questions cuzz you tend to get what you&#39;re expecting and the\n&gt; results are biased at best, and I think you can actaully create the voices\n&gt; you want to hear. Then there&#39;s the problem of somekind of deceptive entities\n&gt; telling you what you want to hear, or providing false and misleading\n&gt; information.\n&gt; \n&gt;  It&#39;s just like any other speech, you judge it by content and meaning. Do\n&gt; they address you by name? Is it names you recognize? I prefer to rely on the\n&gt; guides and others to tell me what I need to know, instead of trying to\n&gt; second guess the communcations.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Theres&#39; too many wanna be experts out there that think they are wise enough\n&gt; to question spirits, and other unknown entites in the usual Holywood pompus\n&gt; all knowing maner that has become the hallmark of paranormal investigators.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  You have to get out of the way of the information to receive it.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun, Dec 13, 2009 at 3:31 PM, Eric Joy &lt;webguru@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  This is something I do not understand unless you ask specific questions\n&gt; &gt; and get answers how can you tell this is not radio gibberish?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; dbmdude\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
