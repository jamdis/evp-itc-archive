<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>right on, dave,

and i know what you mean, the desired voice seems to persist across 
several station hops.

i took the front off the radios and removed string and just grabbed 
the flywheel if plastic or bolted a non-conductive disc on it. the 
size of the flywheel seems about right for a slow enough sweep and 
you can hear voices stretching off each station when it works.  i 
never recorded or understood anything-just noted &quot;otherworldly 
feeling&quot; or spooky resonance of sounds.  right now i have a car radio 
with a toothpick jammed into sweep lever. 

--really interested in software now, though, alas.

if the spread spectrum is maxed in computer bios it has something of 
the same effect.

&gt; I have a very sensitive old AM tuner with a flywheel tuning system. 
I tried several recording sessions manually sweeping the tuner 
through the AM band late at night. I got pretty good at keeping the 
dial moving at a constant rate of speed. This is not nearly as good 
as Frank&#x27;s &#x27;hands off&#x27; random tuning method but it still produced 
some results. What impressed me most is that some of the voices sound 
the same, even though I tuned through several channels. This attached 
capture could be a technical message.
&gt; &quot;Plug a million hertz&quot;   One Million Hertz = 1mhz = 1000khz, which 
is close the center frequency for the AM broadcast band.
