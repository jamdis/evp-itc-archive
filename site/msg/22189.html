<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ok, just found this vid/post today, hoping beyond hope that no one saw my most ignorant post about it earlier. 

 Anyway, yeah, that&#x27;s random, but I don&#x27;t see how it can be used to sweep a radio in it&#x27;s present form. Have a feeling some information with held. It almost implies Hultay made the random sweep work, which I know is highly unlikely. 

 Anyway, trying a new idea picked off the vid. 

 BTW, has the question ever occured to anyone--why random sweep? Answer; cuz the first box was made after I used EVPmaker, which chops up the audio and plays it back--randomly. That&#x27;s why I thought the sweep had to be random. Yeah, the first 20 some boxes were random only, and did work, contrary to what you&#x27;ve been told by one scumbag.

 My aplogoies, but guys like Hultay really piss me off, and it takes a few days to screw my head back on. Yeah, and people claiming to be psychic mediums don&#x27;t see through the lies.

 Oh well, ain&#x27;t gonna matter.

&gt; Wish I had one of your boxes, Frank, they are the best, what I&#x27;d like is  
&gt; one that could use electric as well as battery, that way I could save the  
&gt; battery, they work best with electric anyway.  What ever happened to the  
&gt; Frank&#x27;s Box, that Sharon had?  It was a great box, with great sound, and I  have 
&gt; this bigger Aiwa, I&#x27;d like you to fix Frank, let me know when you can take  
&gt; it?  I have no idea how to turn it into a spirit box. sf

&gt; You gotta be freaking kidding!!! My random mode is smoothly changing  
&gt; voltage that slowly and smoothly changes value- randomly. It looks almost like  
&gt; DC on a scope. This crap in the vid, that would be useless for a sweep, you&#x27;d 
&gt;  get nothing but buzzing from a radio.
&gt; 
&gt; Go ask Chris Moon about his  little blue box, which he has had since, 2006 
&gt; I think, and other larger units  before that.. ALL RANDOM SWEEP, all work 
&gt; every time it&#x27;s turned on. Yet these  jerkfucks would have everyone believe 
&gt; everything I make is pure shit, plus how  they invented it first.
&gt; 
&gt; I ran into problems trying to make the RVG run  single ended, as in a 
&gt; single power supply--instead of needing 16 batteries to  run--only 8 required for 
&gt; single ended. Y&#x27;ll better step back and check your  facts! Then, put a vid 
&gt; of useless random noise--WTF is that crap!?
&gt; 
&gt; What  makes it worse, this group been around since I don&#x27;t rememeber, 
&gt; between 2004  and 2006, and yet no one stands up and says my boxes came long 
&gt; before Hultay,  long before Chapple, before Moon ripped it off and claimed it as 
&gt; Edison&#x27;s  Telephone To The Dead. Even the owner of this group that watched 
&gt; how Chapple  would join the group under one name, quit the group, then come 
&gt; back under  another name, she don&#x27;t stand up and say how my shit came first. 
&gt; 
&gt; And  why do I think everyone in the so called paranromal seeks only fame 
&gt; and  fotune, just making a name for themselves where no proof is required, no  
&gt; credentials, all one has to do is proclaim how great they are, and how 
&gt; useless  everyone else is
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, done here. Useless to debate to with criminal  minds!
