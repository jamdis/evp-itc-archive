I trust Frank&#39;s integrity to tell me if the event (if any happens) is a reasonable match, or not.\n\nI&#39;d rather stumble onto the event on my own, than be accused of trying to mold the event -- or selectively focus on just certain aspects of it -- to fit criteria known ahead of time.\n\nThat&#39;s why I like things like the PEAR project (aka Global Consciousness Project); it&#39;s just numbers.  If and how it correlates... that&#39;s what gets interesting.\n\nCheerfully,\nFiona\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rj &lt;rasterer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I was going to try to objectively compare your statements to anything that might happen on Thursday.  Why get so defensive over that?\n&gt; \n&gt; And why not just post the full details?  It&#39;s not really a prediction if you post the details after the fact.  Something a little better than &quot;Wait... Navy&quot;, which says nothing really.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;"}
