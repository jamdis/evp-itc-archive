<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, I have heard of this.  

I remember one woman speaking of being on a beach and walking right 
out of her body.  This is different from the meditation type of OBE 
and is often referred to as an SOBE - or &quot;spontaneous out of body 
experience.&quot;  I believe this is what you are describing.

&gt; Just kicking around some thoughts in my head, and nobody is up 
tonight to share thier ideas so I am writing it down anyway while 
it&#x27;s fresh in my thoughts. 
&gt;    
&gt;   I know and understand pretty well about OOB&#x27;s and have read 
peoples experiences. So far all of my disembodied experiences were 
while I was &quot;unconcious&quot; with little to verify any of the 
experiences as being anything but a dream state. However lately I 
have begun to do something again that I havent done since I was a 
small child. 
&gt;    
&gt;   You know how it is when you wake up in the morning hit the 
snooze button, roll over and lay there thinking..... man I dont want 
to get up right now I am soooo comfortable. Well lets just say I do 
that alot even tho I usually get up before the next alarm hits in a 
few minutes I still press it, roll over and lay there for a minute 
LOL. Some people hit the coffee machine.. i hit the snooze.
&gt;    
&gt;   However, lately I am rolling over, but the body seems to stay 
still turned the other way. I used to do it often when I was a kid I 
would wake up in a totally different position than I thought I was 
laying in when I had my eyes closed. I&#x27;d think I was layin on my 
stomache and realize I was flat on my back or on my side. With 
gravity its pretty easy to feel which end is facing down and once I 
am fully alert its a little disorientating at first. I am curious if 
anybody else has that experience, including those who travel out of 
body at will.
