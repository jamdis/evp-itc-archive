Hmmm you will have to tell me what the filename was it doesnt number them on my end. Like 031206h.jpg or whatever. I call him the sockpuppet guy because when I recieved it I thought that looked like a big sock puppet he was holding up LOL. 

But yes I used the webcam for those. I dont know why sometimes they are clear and sometimes they are more pixelated. Same as evp never know why its clearer some days than others.

&gt; Thanks for the welcome, Misty.  I saw your photo album on
&gt; your 
&gt; website.  Those are awesome caps.  Did you only use a
&gt; webcam for 
&gt; these?  Some of them came out so clearly.  I left a comment
&gt; on one of 
&gt; them. (031206h)  I think some of yours are more clear than
&gt; some I have 
&gt; seen using the camcorder and t.v. screen.  How did you get
&gt; the dots on 
&gt; number 44?  Is there a way to focus in better?</pre>
