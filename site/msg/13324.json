I recently joined the group after becoming very interested in EVP and basically \nthe whole idea of after death communication. Thus far I have only used a digital recorder to \nrecord at random times during trips to cemeteries etc. without success.Now I would like to \ntry some more controlled efforts as far as set times, set questions and have purchased a \nhacked radioshack 12-469? \n\nMy questions if anyone can help\n\nmy hacked radio has no external speaker only a place for earbuds, is there some kind of a \ncord or connecter I can get that will hook it to a external speaker? how about some kind of \ncord to hook it to a digital reorder..or a spit cord to do both?? I am very, very electroncially \nchallenged so do these exists?? what are they called? and where can I buy them?\n\nmy next question has to do with attempting to record EVP , anything you have noted which \nseems to encourage success?\n\nthanks in advance!"}
