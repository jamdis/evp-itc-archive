And Edison said he was working closely with someone, i think a "meek." and  
was trying to with Frank, but he is "waiting to see what happens" i guess

LOL Snowfire! Nope it was not you this time. Others should read before they 
 post because we just addressed this subject. Esnips is very easy to use it 
has  two uploading options in case you cant use the java application use 
the single  file uploader. Works alot like email upload attachments.

If you need  more help just holler and I am sure one of us will be more 
than willing to  help you figure it out. Posting from email as an attachment 
also works just  not so well for the very large file sizes. There are many 
other file sharing  storage places besides esnips. We just like the layout 
there and the ability  to share with friends including sharing storage space.
