<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks. It&#x27;s the same &quot;scientific&quot; BS, this time with &quot;more qualified
listeners&quot;, not only that, from an unexpected source. There&#x27;s skpetics that
want the boxes to go away, and there&#x27;s EVP authorities that want the boxes
to go away.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m amazed when anyone claims they can&#x27;t clearly hear the voices. Okay, so
&gt; far my only experience has been listening to Chris Moon&#x27;s sessions in
&gt; Canada, and the recordings posted here.
&gt;
&gt; What I hadn&#x27;t expected were consistent voices. Oh, I&#x27;d heard some &quot;Shack
&gt; Hack&quot; recordings with one word in a female voice, another word sung, a third
&gt; word in a male voice, and so on. That didn&#x27;t impress me.
&gt;
&gt; My experiences with Chris&#x27; work startled me. Your recordings astonish and
&gt; impress me.
&gt;
&gt; (Not just yours, Frank, but many of the recordings posted to this list.
&gt; I&#x27;ve been listening in my spare time, trying to wrap my brain around how
&gt; well this works, and how I&#x27;ve been totally missing the boat with this stuff,
&gt; for years.)
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m hearing consistent voices, consistent accents, consistent speech
&gt; patterns.
&gt;
&gt; Regularly, I have to debate so-called authorities who want to be the
&gt; best/only &quot;experts&quot; in the paranormal field. (That&#x27;s one of the perils of
&gt; appearing on panels at events.)
&gt;
&gt; Someone else in the field aptly described the self-proclaimed authorities
&gt; as a bunch of junkyard dogs fighting over a chewed-over bone.
&gt;
&gt; Well, maybe that&#x27;s an insult to junkyard dogs, now that I think about it.
&gt;
&gt; My point is: A whole lot of what I see at paranormal events is about status
&gt; and politics. I&#x27;m not interested in that. I&#x27;m interested in results.
&gt;
&gt; Results are what I&#x27;m seeing on this list. That&#x27;s what matters.
&gt;
&gt; Keep doing what you&#x27;re doing. This is important.
&gt;
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; Fiona
