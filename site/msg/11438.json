The files are too large to be uploaded to the forum here, but a\nshort video with the audio clips has been posted on You Tube by Joey\nTito, a Chicago researcher who filmed the investigation.  The audio\nclips are at the end, and Joey matched them to a transcript of what I\npicked up.  I sent the clips to Frank, and he picked up even more.\n\nThe You Tube link is www.youtube.com/xflexx1  Joey has a short version\nand a long version; pick the short one.\n\nI have a report on the investigation posted on my blog on MySpace at\nwww.myspace.com/rosemaryellenguiley  and Joey&#39;s video is on my home\npage there as well.  The blog also has my report on a similar\ninvestigation at Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield; the clips from\nthat are posted on this forum in my folder.\n\nRegards,\nRosemary"}
