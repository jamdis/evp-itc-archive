Thanks Bruce for the kind words.

I am very interested in live Spirit commu=
nication, just really don't know how to go about it.

I saw the Franks Box =
on the Penn State Paranormal Show. I had heard of it before then, but had n=
ot seen one in use. It is awesome and many hats off to Frank for making the=
m. 

As far as electronics, I am doing good to get the VCR hooked up right.=
 LOL. I am a Registered Nurse, now disabled and worked for over 25 years in=
 Trauma and Critical Care. 

I had the fortune to actually see with my phys=
ical eyes the Soul leaving two of my patients that had died, although I hav=
e been interested in the Spiritual since I was a teenager. I also had a few=
 patients tell me about their Near Death Experiences. 

Kay and Margaret. Y=
es, aren't our animal babies just the most wonderful.  We are happily owned=
 by our six cats (I had two when my sweet wife and I married and Deb had th=
ree. We live with my elderly father-in-law and we include his cat as ours a=
lso, although, I'm not sure if that works both ways. LOL. 

I have had seve=
ral dogs and cats pass over the years and when I get to the other side I do=
n't know if I look forward to seeing them or my family and friends more. 

=
Four Jack Russell's. Wow. Molly wears my arm out throwing her squeaka all d=
ay. I would be on the DL for sure with four of them. LOL.

Blessings All,
