It's a cool idea to see if blocking all radio waves can still provide voice=
s, it's a really bad idea to proclaim the voices aren't from spirits if the=
 radio is allowed to come through. The simple fact is that "something" is u=
sing the fragments of radio talk to build communication. 

As rediculous as=
 this sounds I got a communication that was a piece of a modern day pop son=
g. Static blocked just the right sylables of the lyrics to create new words=
. I was lucky to have someone recognize the song, then I analyzed exactly w=
hat happened to make the words say something different. It's amazing how th=
is works.

It's totally absurd to say only messages from boxes housed in fa=
raday cages should be taken seriously. The point of this experiment is to p=
rove supernatural origin of the messages in general. Once "supernatural" or=
igin of only one message is "proven" it becomes unneccesary to have every l=
ast message proven. IMO it will be impossible to prove supernatural origin.=
 The supernatural almost always occurs in such a way to leave room for doub=
t for skeptics.

 The key to spirit communcation is to provide a raw audio, which 
  started=
 out as white noise, now is bits of speech, music and noise 
  from a radio=
--a convinient source of raw audio. Go ahead, use a farady 
  cage, block a=
ll raw audio out, and when you get no voices/evp, you can 
  proclaim there=
 is no evidence for spirit! Same old "scientific" crap. 
  Whatever you do,=
 don't ask anyone that's been doing this work for 
  close to ten years, in=
 my case, and close to 30 years for the inventor 
  of EVPmaker, god forbid=
 you should ask any real experts. Oh, yeah, 
  titles and degrees mean y'al=
