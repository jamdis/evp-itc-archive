Hi,

Has anyone here heard of Alice Whitehill? She lives near me and has
b=
ooks out on her evps she had gotten. She uses a musical instrument
called a=
 dolcymer (unsure of spelling) to attract the voices. She gets
class A loud=
 evps sounds just like a living person is talking right into
the microphone=
. Some even shout. She has a recording of pretty boy floyd
that states his =
full real name, and many from gettysburg. They all
respond to her questions=
 and conversation. One of her books is 'in tune
with spirits'.

You can hea=
r some of our evps at this link. These are from the groups I
belong to loca=
lly. They are not as good as Alice Whitehills.
