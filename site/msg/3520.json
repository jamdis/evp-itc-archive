I don&#39;t know\nChris Moon\n&gt; &gt; but I have heard him on C2C and have read his opinions.  I am\nalways weary\n&gt; &gt; of anyone claiming to be one of a &quot;chosen few&quot; and using fear to\nfurther\n&gt; &gt; their arguments.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The fear-based reasoning&#39;s and omni-potent subterfuge employed by\nMr. Moon\n&gt; &gt; only tells me to ignore him and anyone else like him.  There is no\nmanual or\n&gt; &gt; class  this research is done by Joe-Schmo in his basement and\ntherefore\n&gt; &gt; open to many different interpretations and methodologies.

In fact he has yet to pay anything for the\nboxes he has,\n&gt; &gt; or any of the other equipment he &quot;barrowed&quot;, such as the Sony\npocket size\n&gt; &gt; cassette recorder, and Tarot CD, he still has. Moon is the one\nthat claims\n&gt; &gt; only he, or a designated trainee can properly interpret the output\nof the\n&gt; &gt; box, despite the fact that I have stated numerous times that I\nmade the box\n&gt; &gt; for anyone to use, and one&#39;s results are any no better or supercede in\n&gt; &gt; anyway the results of anyone else. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  Now when someone claims that these new system don&#39;t work, or only\nget the\n&gt; &gt; evil spirits, and even open portals so demons, or what not can\nenter, they\n&gt; &gt; are lying, and attempting to keep the use of any equipment,  and\nmethods of\n&gt; &gt; spirit communication for themselves. The motive being priofit,a s\nfar as I\n&gt; &gt; can tell. The portal thing is Hollywood! I use my equimpemt in my\nbasement,.\n&gt; &gt; and have sinece 2000, amnd have never expereinced anything I could\ncall evil\n&gt; &gt; beside soem cussing, nakme calling voices, which is hardly threatening\n&gt; &gt; except to maybe 13 year old girl. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  I must point put, because of preivisou threats, that slander is\nstating\n&gt; &gt; something in public about a person that is knowingly untrue. So\nfor anyone\n&gt; &gt; comptemplating such threats I can say only-- Bring It, I will have\n&gt; &gt; everything you own!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   _____  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You keep typing, we keep giving.

Put him &quot;out of business&quot; in making money/profits from\nYOUR box! This seem unethical in what he&#39;s now doing, don&#39;t ya think?\n  My 2c worth.
