&gt;  I can make two guesses One is some religous fanatic taliban type a-
hole thinks we are talking to demons, and letting evil into the 
world, so they have to shut it down for our own good. The other, and 
more likely is someone might loose money, so going to extreme 
measures.  I don&#x27;t sell my boxes, so they are relatively rare, and 
have little, but controlable  impact, but the inexpensive radios are 
easily obtainable, and you don&#x27;t need a guru to tell what you are 
really hearing. There&#x27;s more than one party out there that stands to 
loose much if the current paranormal theories, and fear crap is 
disproven, so don&#x27;t get the idea I&#x27;m talking aobut one person.
&gt;  
&gt;  The informatin is out there, the site contents copied by many. 
Making threats over the internet to control people is federal crime, 
and the FBI has a site for reproting this.    Frank-S

&gt; I just went over to their website and saw all the modification 
information was gone and a reference to a disturbing message about a 
threat was there. Anyone know what happened?- Mike
