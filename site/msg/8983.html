All it takes is a little patience and a lot of frustration 
 
Well your on your way, just remember treat our friends on the other side the way you
would want to be treated with respect and consideration, they will always do their best for you.
 
Now comes the real learning process, to develop your ear for hearing the communication real time
and for being open to it.
 
Baby steps, baby steps. Don't rush it and it will come.
If you need anything you know you have 24/7 access.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] A few EVPMR files posted

        After redoing everything I was doing, and with a lot a help from the group, I think I actually hear a few things from my latest three minute evpmaker session.  I have posted in my files at Ronriko.  In one file I clearly hear the name R LEDERER.  It is unmistaken because most of my family can't even pronounce my last name correctly (but not the German pronunciation).    What is also interesting is the name came after I asked who is there to speak to me and before I asked them to say my name.  I do have at least two relatives on the other side with the same first initial as mine.  Interesting that they said R and not Ron.  This answer was heard a little more than half way into the file but I have posted more hoping someone hears more and can let me know.  That goes with the other files I have posted.  
   
  One other file posted, I hear ....I WILL SAVE....but I cannot make out what comes before or after.  Two other files have no messages but I am hoping someone will listen and comment.  
  It's great to get something I can hear but I am certain I am missing tooooo much.  It's a start.   Thanks Bruce, Stefan and Margaret.   Ron L
