<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Actually, I have all the wiring done on both new boards, and now just 
starting to debug the circuits as a system. I try to test each part as I 
build, but there&#x27;s always problems with these hand made boards.  I had a bad 
two cent capacitor that made me nuts for days before I found it, but now the 
first board( system #18) seems to be doing ok, at least as far as the random 
voltage generator goes, and it seems to be more stable with the higher 
capacity batteries. I added RF amplifiers to the radio front ends, there&#x27;s 
two, one AM, and the shortwave converter.

I used a Japanese shortwave broadcast as raw audio the other day, and got 
some interesting voices. I&#x27;ll see if I can get some of that copied. I&#x27;ve 
been busy during the day with another recumbent bike for the older Grand 
son, then I work on my boards at night, I stayed up til 2:30 this morning.
