<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey guy&#x27;s 

I just got done hacking the new box Steve H. has found.
It works fine on all bands. It is a little tougher to modify than a 
469 or 470 in the fact that it is harder to disassemble but with a 
little patience you will have a nice little box.

It sweeps smoothly and has a telescopic antenna attached, runs on 3 AA
batteries or an AC adapter, the adapter is not supplied with the 
radio but can be purchased at radio shack.

I have not done a session with it as I only finished the hack about 5 
minutes ago, but everything is working fine and it is sweeping nicely.

 something to beware of, when you remove the second board you release 
two small plastic buttons that are for changing the sw band and the 
lcd light they can fall out of the radio and are not so easy to 
replace so be careful of that.

Both back and front covers remove, the front cover will come loose 
after removing the second board and you will see the speaker. You 
must carefully turn the second board over and you will see a grey 
ribbon wire, the individual wires are attached by an 1/8 inch of 
plastic on either side of each wire. The wire that you must clip is 
the mute wire, It is the 7th wire from the top.

Cut the plastic attaching the wires together with an exacto knife or 
razor blade, just enough to get a small pair of scissors in to snip 
the correct wire. I like to not only snip the wire but snip out about 
an 1/8 of an inch segment of the wire so that the cut ends do not 
accidentally touch to make a connection when the box is reassembled.

The modification is by no means hard it is just have to be a bit more 
attentive than when you modify a 469 or 470.

Anyone that feels they will have a problem you can skype me under
Bruce Halliday and I will be glad to talk you through it.
