Please don't give up.  I am still learning, and I need a teacher.  Even though we don't know each other.  I try to learn something everday from you, so I will be able to make my own box one day.   Even if is a frankinized 12-469, or made from a car stereo.  I with ya all the way, even though some stuff I know nothing about, and thats why I learn, to get educated on the subject.  I have already studying basic electronics.

 Whatever you do don't let spirit speak, try to second guess everything, always assume y'all are so much more advanced.
