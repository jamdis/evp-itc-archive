I had some static and \nlearned to move the radio around to a better spot.\nBut amazingly one of the messages was &quot; I want to see Bruce !&quot;\nYou can hear it clear as day.  \nAlso, I got some vulgar messages and I wonder about this.  When \nDebbie did a session with me in the beginning she got some eye \nopening messages for me.  One was &quot;cut the bull ----&quot;.  Debbie said \nthat can&#39;t be !!! but it was right on !!! we were trying to contact \nmy mom and that was one of her favorite sayings here !!! LOL\nHowever, the messages Bruce recovered in my session were a little \nmore vulgar and not something from my mom.\nI also had events in the house after starting recording sessions.\nThe RS box would go on by itself, not while I was home, and I live \nalone.  This happened several times, the third time I came home my \ncomputerized clothes dryer locked it&#39;s control panel, the RS was on \nand my wireless router needed to be reset. \nI now need help with Audacity or sound booth.  I don&#39;t know how to \nuse it to clean the background noise up.\nThanks again Bruce (I hope you don&#39;t mind my posting !!??)\nHolly"}
