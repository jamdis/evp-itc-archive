So far I have tried sounds \nlike an exhaust fan, water faucet running, crowd at a party etc. I \ndownload the specific sound file and play it in a loop in the \nbackground while doing an evp recording session, I have been keeping \nthe sessions short as in one question and ample time for a responce. I \nhave gotten a feew evp&#39;s from the different sounds but none that do not \nneed to be worked on. I will post a couple in my file folder if anyone \ncares to listen and please let me know what you think.\n\nbruce"}
