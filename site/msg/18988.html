<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Tim:

I, too, saw the &quot;guess my line&quot; (i.e. guess the secret object) experiment on the ITC web site as well and also thought of someone else who used to be on this group. I suspect he may possibly have gotten that idea from this web site?

In any case, I did find this article on the ITC web site discrediting or debunking or whatever the proper term is for EVP&#x27;s via radio sweep. Perhaps this is what you are referring to?

I read on the Butlers ATC site a few months back that they had a grouptesting the boxes and they would post their findings soon.  Are these the results that the Butler&#x27;s came up with from this test, or are these results from an early experiment?  I just went to their site and couldn&#x27;t find mention of it, but right on their homepage there was this: 
&gt; &quot;Everyone is invited to use EVPmaker to name the secret object.&quot; 
&gt; Sounds familiar, huh?  I wonder if RJ is part of their group.
