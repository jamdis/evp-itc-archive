I'm new here, so maybe I don't have the interpretations down yet, but the "ispoke" file sounds like, "interest in Ronnie's folder," to me.

It helps when they use a direct response or say your name. Its part of why I prefer to use water method for my recordings, then there is no deciding what is what. I suggest you start out recording short sessions. I usually record sweep for about 3 minutes at most. With water its always about 30 seconds of recording time and that recording can contain 1-30 messages on -74 speed. The speech is usually very very fast, different vibration than we have and with water the speech is way outside normal human speech rates.
 
Attaching a recent h2o clip it should come as attachment to those getting individual emails. I dunno if you will hear this so I chose a short one of someone saying "I spoke" to give you some idea of what I mean. This is in the -74 speed range (slowed in audacity). Good luck!

How does one tell which is only radio stations going by and spirit chat?  The channels go by so quickly that it's hard to tell, even now on AM, I won't know what to cut, maybe just try loading on a short tapping, but I got to learn how to slow it down I guess.  Sounds like people having a party in the back room, I had to turn it off.  I opened the door, and it was quiet, when i walked in it was like hundreds of voices!  But, this could only be radio channels, even the AM was just buzzing away with them, the quietest was Short wave, very few words, then there were a lot of Spanish people, don't know what they were talking about, was a mess!
