Upon checking my lo=\r\ngs, every time one of  these clicks were heard, there would be an EMF spike=\r\n in the livingroom. The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the livingroom downstairs.=\r\n The home owners have also reported that they have a touch lamp that comes =\r\non all the time by itself and the lights in the Kitchen will dim occasional=\r\nly.\n\nNow these taps are not consistent in timing, loudness or rhythm. Could=\r\n this be the work of faulty breakers?\n\nThanks!\nApril\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0189_01C9DE19.ECBE4150\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18702&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYL=\r\nE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;=\r\n&gt;Hi All,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;Is there someone here that c=\r\nan answer and \nelectrical question for me?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2=\r\n face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad=\r\n Pro&quot;&gt;During the case that I recorded those \npossible EVP&#39;s-there was a lou=\r\nd tapping noise that seemed to come from the 2nd \nbedroom.
