                  F-S, I certainly hope I didn't offend you wi=
th anything I said.  I certainly do not claim to be a braniac or a know-it-=
all, as you have called me in your post.

                  In fact I am sa=
ying the opposite: I am saying that I do not know:  I am saying I do not kn=
ow how anyone can believe these 2012 predictions when all they have is stor=
ies and questionable claims.  I don't know how they can believe this stuff =
when they actually DO have evidence that all the similar claims in the past=
 have been shown to be false. I do not know why they believe this claim is =
any more justified than all the others,

                  I do not know ho=
w the group can say on its home page " It's one thing to be skeptical, it's=
 another to ignore and deny all evidence.", yet it is the people who are ce=
rtain of the 2012 prophecies that seem to be ignoring and denying evidence =
that it is only one more in a long line of unsupported failed predictions, =
not those who are skeptical of it.

                  I do not know how it =
justifies you referring to me as  a "wanne be brianiacs claiming to know al=
l", when the group home page suggests such attacks get people banned.  I do=
 not know how being skeptical of a future prophecy makes one a know it all.=
 And I do not know how prompting people to judge for themselves makes me a =
know it all. 

                  And I don't know why the group home page s=
ays a good argument is ok, yet you start name-calling offended when someone=
 questions something you do not agree with, or proposes a theory alternate =
to your own.

                  So call me ignorant.  Obviously I really do=
n't know very much at all.  

                  But of the very few things =
I do know, I now it is good to question, and not take everything, especiall=
y prophecies, at face value.  And I know the best way to test a prophecy, a=
nd the people making them, is to see if they actually come to pass.  And I =
know that since no evidence can support a prophecy's truth until it comes t=
o pass, and since all past end-of-world prophecies have no evidence of thei=
r success, that those who think they know something special about why 2012 =
is different, certainly know more than I.

                  And so I hope =
they (or you, if you count yourself among them) will post your evidence, an=
d your predictions, and your dates.  And we won't have to argue about it.  =
We can just put that person, and their predictions, and their dates, on our=
 calendars, and judge when the date comes, who was really acting as a know-=

                  One thing I think we can all agree on:  one kn=
