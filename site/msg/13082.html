<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s interesting Laurie.  How have you seen radios like that messing
up equipment? What equipment do you think is susceptible to that kind
of radio interference?

&gt; Two way radios  - arghhh - they interfere with equipment! We forbid
use of them and all cell phones have to be OFF.

&gt; I know my team when we go out we have two way radios and cellphones
so there is no yelling and we are pretty quiet. During the whole in
vestigation except prayers.But the only time we had to be loud is when
I was attacked.

&gt; Im sitting here watching Ghost Hunters...and I know alot of it is
done for drama purposes...but Im curious...when ya&#x27;ll are out on an
investigation do you talk as much as they do?  I can hardly hear
anything over them chatting.  Also I notice a cpl of their people
freak out when they get knocks or other responses... nobody ever says
hey thanks for the effort you put into responding or great job or
anything like that..its always wtf was that, what the hell is going on
in here, etc...do ya&#x27;ll say thanks and compliment the efforts of the
responding spirits?  Ive never been on an investigation with a team so
Im kinda curious how different groups work and run things.(wish I knew
people in arizona I could go on an investigation with)  I know when I
do my research here with my radio shack hack I always say thanks and
am polite and have never freaked out or cussed in response to one of
the responses Ive gotten.  Anyways just curious.  Hope everyone has a
great weekend!
