 Yeah, I need to watch the bitch closer, she tries to get out sometimes. That would be my inner bitch. 
 
 I did a recording last night with HackyBox, and heard the word "huricane". I'm seeing the same "signs" as before Katrina, but bigger. Big circles in the clouds, and "eyes". The eyes are like the eye sockets of a skull face. So far this spring, every "eye" sighting has been before a tornado out east. 
 
 Another face in the shower, a guy with big hair, almost dreadlocks, a large thick mustache, very pronounced brow ridge, and eye sockets, long chin. He was in the window, and for the first time, the shower curtain.
