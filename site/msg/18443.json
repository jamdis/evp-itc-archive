And to maybe even have a little fun.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Friday, 8/6/2010 I placed an object in front of my fireplace, on the brick hearth, and will leave it there until noon Denver time on Monday, 8/9/2010.   This experiment asks for participants to determine what that object is. Vague or partial answers won&#39;t be counted (for example, just giving a color, shape, size, what it&#39;s made of, etc): we&#39;re looking for what it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#39;t count.  Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means they chose.  At the end of the experiment, I will reveal the object, and a tally of the number of correct and/or incorrect answers.\n&gt; \n&gt; The object is directly in front of the fireplace (not inside the fireplace), on the bricks of the hearth (not off to the right or left of the fireplace).  There are no sources of EMF interference nearby.  Here is a picture of the fireplace hearth where the object has been placed: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/Location.jpg\n&gt; \n&gt; In order to keep me honest, I have taken a picture of the object at the start of the experiment and loaded it as a passworded pdf to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group.  The idea with this file is that you can download it now and &#39;keep it safe&#39; on your computer. Then at the end of the experiment, I will post the password so you can reveal the contents of the file. That way, you were in control of the original image during the entire test, not me.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Password pdf: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100806.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; And if you do not care to download the pdf file now, I will post the final image there at the end of the experiment anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please post all answers to the group thread: that way, there will be a public record and I won&#39;t get accused of losing any answers. Any answers sent directly to me, I will repost on the public thread.\n&gt; \n&gt; And best of luck to all the participants!\n&gt;"}
