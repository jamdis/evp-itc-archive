<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello all, although I didn&#x27;t anticipate the direction this thread has
gone, it is an important subject. There are those in the physical and
non-physical planes that do not have the best intentions. It is
unfortunate and sometimes I am idealistic and wish the world would be
a place where everyone can work, live, and research together. But
that&#x27;s not the way it always is.

I was brought up in a wonderful home where the possibility of the
existence of supernatural beings was accepted by my parents. Now,
decades later, in our home we also accept this possibility and our
kids, even though grown, are making up their own minds. The research I
do is not taken lightly but we attract those that have similar values
to our own. Even in the spirit world. This technology that Frank has
brought forth is another form of ITC, and anyone with a video camera
and tv can engage in video ITC. I don&#x27;t think it would be possible to
regulate who can have a camera and tv, just as we can&#x27;t regulate who
has access to any other technology including radios.

It&#x27;s more of a matter of personal responsibility instead of the means
we use to communicate.

&gt; babiarz3,
&gt;  
&gt; I believe the posts you are referring to about family hour with the box
&gt; where written in a light manner in jest. I do not presume to speak
for anyone 
&gt; else on this group I&#x27;m sure they can speak for themselves.
&gt;  
&gt; you speak of responsibility with any form of open communication, I
believe the individuals that are
&gt; studying and distributing the mini box are sufficiently experienced
and know who they should sell to and who not.
&gt;  
&gt; I don&#x27;t believe they mean to put the mini box on the shelves in toys
r us. Anyone that uses a box whether it be a Frank&#x27;s box
&gt; A Joe&#x27;s box or a mini box will probably have done some research into
this method of evp and will probably have some intimate experience
&gt; with the paranormal field and if not I&#x27;m sure they will seek advice
from those of us that have that experience. There is never a lack of
advice here.
&gt;  
&gt; as far as dark heads go I know through personal experience that they
can be deceiving and manipulative with someone that does not know any
better
&gt; I have a Frank&#x27;s box and a Joe&#x27;s box and do serious research on a
daily basis. My opinion is the good spirits out weigh the negative
ones and anyone
&gt; that experiments with a box will tell you that you do forge strong
bonds with what I call my spirit guides or technicians, the same two
spirits communicate 
&gt; with me during every session and protect me from negativity. As long
as I do not feed the darkies with my own negativity I am fine.
&gt;  
&gt; Also I believe that the people who are distributing the mini box
have set that price to deter any average person that&#x27;s completely
ignorant of the paranormal
&gt; away from purchasing this device.
&gt;  
&gt; I have never met bill personally but know of him, he is a well
respected researcher and is well aware I think of the pitfalls as well
as the rewards of box communication.
&gt; and I don&#x27;t believe he would ever endanger himself, his family or
anyone else by carelessly using the box for entertainment purposes.
&gt;  
&gt; that Is my opinion for what it&#x27;s worth.

&gt; 
&gt; I am a fairly quiet person, most of the time. I have my thoughts
andopinions on topics but feel strongly about &quot;to each his own&quot;.
Unlesssomething strikes me as completely wrong, I won&#x27;t debate. No one
herehas heard from me other than recently with this mini-box yet, I
amhere several times weekly reading and offering my energy in support
ofthe research.However...something is striking me here and again, I
can&#x27;t keep mymouth shut. The discussion about the family hour with the
box has ledthe way for people to mention negativity and even &quot;the dark
guys&quot; canbe fun if not taken seriously.I ask you to consider the fact
that many who purchase the mini-boxwill not be of the right frame of
mind. Most will not be in harmony.Many will take &quot;the dark guys&quot;
seriously. Yet, you feel it&#x27;s a goodidea to let anyone who wants a box
have one? All in the name ofsharing technology.I know that my previous
posts expressing my concern over the massmarketing of the box, was
barely given consideration. Realize that Iam not being selfish- I do
not own a box. EVP is my passion and hasbeen from day one 6 years ago
when I jumped fully into the field. I amsuccessful in capturing EVP,
always have been. I still do it the &quot;oldfashioned way&quot; with open air
techniques. Would I love to be able tohold real time 2 way
communications with the other side? Of course.However, I do not think
enough research into the possibilities hasbeen done to warrant the
approval let alone production of these boxes. Those of us who have
been on countless investigations with many peoplewill quickly admit
that there are some people we&#x27;d rather notinvestigate with. When they
are present, negative things tend tohappen. We all know one or two
people who we can say &quot;felt dark&quot; fromthe first meeting. We all admit
that being mentally sound is animportant quality in this field. If you
have mental issues, this maynot be the area of research for you. We
don&#x27;t bring children oninvestigations for obvious reasons. BUT! If you
want a box that couldpossibly open up a portal and bridge the gap
between here and thedark, sure! Anyone who wants one should have it!
You might feel that I am over reacting or being overly dramatic.That&#x27;s
fine. My concern is not what you think of me but that youconsider the
possibilities here. Many of which we do not know. Can yoube 100% sure
that this is a good idea or that it&#x27;s worthy of saying&quot;well, we&#x27;ll see
what happens&quot;? --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce
halliday&lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Bill,&gt; &gt; You have the
right idea, I recently have dealt with a lot&gt; of negativity from my
Frank&#x27;s box. Harmony is very important&gt; as is the right frame of mind
before turning the box on.&gt; &gt; hope you &amp; the family had a good
holiday.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday Paranormal Investigating Team &gt; &gt;

[EVP-ITC] Family hour around the radio&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe we&#x27;re just a
little unconventional in our household, but mostof us here are pretty
open to the idea of the multiverse. Gathering ina circle around our
Frank&#x27;s Box is our idea of quality family time.The messages are
relevent, the interest is high, and we&#x27;re very wellgrounded and do not
let the tricksters push us around.HappyThanksgiving from our home to
