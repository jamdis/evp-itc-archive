<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Dave, I&#x27;ll send again with some keywords in the subject line. 
Here&#x27;s hoping.

&gt; I would try emailing him agin, i talk to him every couple of days 
and for some reason a lot of emails go to his junk box, even a few of 
mine. Try putting somthing in the title about Ghost or paranormal. I 
think that should help it not go to junk.

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; I have emailed Rob recently (and some time back I recall), but 
&gt; received no reply to date. He may not be giving out plans anymore, 
or 
&gt; is not monitoring his emails - dont know. 
&gt; 
&gt; Only other chance is getting plans from someone who has received 
them 
&gt; already.

&gt; &gt; Go to DeadScience. com and write to Rob he has plans for a 
working 
&gt; speakjet box, he has made several of them. and has given out the 
&gt; plans to peaple befor.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi, (Im new to the group)
&gt; &gt; No actual plans as yet, but have the concept in mind that Im 
going 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; work into a device. Maybe this will help somewhat...
&gt; &gt; 1. Speakjet chip and suitable audio amp.
&gt; &gt; 2. PIC microcontroller, configured to talk to Speakjet serial 
port 
&gt; at 
&gt; &gt; 9600 baud, including baud sync and flow control feedback from SJ.
&gt; &gt; 3. An array of &quot;speak&quot; (ascii)commands programmed into PIC to 
&gt; initiate 
&gt; &gt; outputting of all specific allophones, as per the Speakjet 
&gt; datasheet.
&gt; &gt; 4. External sensor of some form (perhaps EMF) that is able to act 
&gt; as 
&gt; &gt; environmental trigger for allophone speaking.
&gt; &gt; 5.PIC sub-routine to allow PIC to read and digitize the sensor 
&gt; analog 
&gt; &gt; output via the PIC&#x27;s A/D input(s).
&gt; &gt; 6 PIC sub-routine to link incoming sensor data to the selection 
of 
&gt; &gt; allophone output, depending on sensor level thresholds, etc and 
&gt; perhaps 
&gt; &gt; a random selection process.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There is a Yahoo group dedicated to the Speakjet chip, but it 
wont 
&gt; be 
&gt; &gt; of much help in this case. The core work is in the PIC 
programming.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Think thats about it for now. Hope this helps.
&gt; &gt; regards from &quot;down under&quot;,
&gt; &gt; JEFF
