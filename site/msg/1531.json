I replaced the capacitors in the whithe\n&gt; &gt; noise amp\n&gt; &gt; that control the gain, and voila--kick butt box. This is one of two\n&gt; &gt; that I\n&gt; &gt; tried &quot;ugly construction&quot;, where the components are mounted on an\n&gt; &gt; unetched\n&gt; &gt; piece of copper clad board in an effort to reduce size. One\n&gt; &gt; drawback with\n&gt; &gt; this box is it&#39;s AC powered, so not portable to places wihtout\n&gt; &gt; power--like\n&gt; &gt; grave yards, so I might convert it.  I have one more of these, #12,\n&gt; &gt; but the\n&gt; &gt; tuner needs to be replaced.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t get caught with egg on your face.
