I just recently (past few weeks) heard about ghost boxes. \n\nI watched a few videos and read some stuff on building several different types (modifying existing devices).\n\nI started with the 12-469 the completely white one. My first go around not much happened but the second go around I got the same name twice and a hello and a response of good after I asked how they were doing. \n\nI haven&#39;t had much time to really dig into it good, but one thing is glaringly obvious is the annoying and constant ticking sound it makes is there anyway to disable this or should I just move to a different radio?\n\nI chose this one because of the cost and 2 because of the various footage I saw and their results. I just didn&#39;t notice the horrific ticking as it scanned through the AM band. ( I haven&#39;t had any luck with FM and haven&#39;t tried much since it seems to find so many stations and doesn&#39;t sweep through fast enough kinda invalidating anything I might have caught.)\n\n\nSecond is there a sight you recommend for hosting files that a good contingent of people see as reputable?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nShane"}
