Hello Cat
   
  Keith has had some success with water images, I havent tried that one yet. I have had moderate success with the loop and great success with other methods like you saw on my site. I havent had alot of time to focus on it lately. Welcome to the group and hope you enjoy talking with us about your methods/results.

          A big hello to everyone,
I am the founder of the circle uk evp group
I have been recording Evp and capturing images for awhile now
Mind you i seem now to be hitting a blank wall with my images these 
past few months as i am working on a transparent method in the loop
Frustration can be an understatment on bad days,lol.
So i thought i would get a wee bit of advice on these other techniques 
people are now using,I also work with water and results there seem to 
be getting on fine.
I am not very techie minded although i try:-)
On the Evp side of things i have no problems as i get good/bad days 
like anyone else.

Take Care
Cat:-)
