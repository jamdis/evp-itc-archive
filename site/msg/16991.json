I think Frank asked a very good  \nquest=\r\nion so let me explain who I am, what direction I am looking at this from  a=\r\nnd \nperhaps my own personal belief systems.\n \nMy name is Dwayne Claud and I=\r\n have worked in the area of demonology now for \n over ten years. Yes still =\r\na youngster in the area but then again isn&#39;t \neveryone  given the life of a=\r\n demonic and angelic entity. My professional \nbackground comes  from one of=\r\n therapeutic nature with advanced studies in \ntherapeutic  hypnosis.\n \nMy p=\r\nersonal belief system is that a ouija board or spirit board really is  \nnot=\r\nhing more than a piece of cardboard and a piece of plastic placed upon \nit.=\r\n It  is the intension that is placed into the object that opens the \ndoorwa=\r\ny. I do  believe though that an individual, at least one, needs to have som=\r\ne \nsort of  mediumship ability in order to use one successfully. I have wat=\r\nched \nindividuals  who have worked on a board that have had nothing happen =\r\nand \nothers where lots of  information have come through - I personally hav=\r\ne had a \nplanchette shoot  across the room.\n \nI understand the concept of i=\r\ndeomotor and the micro-movements of muscles as \n a response from the subcon=\r\nscious. This is a valid theory when it comes to \nthe  use of certain divina=\r\ntion tools such as dowsing rods and pendulums, \nouija boards  are much larg=\r\ner tool and steps outside of the ideomotor concept \ndue to the  larger musc=\r\nles which would need to be used. This would also be \ntrue of table  tipping=\r\n. The interesting concept is when information comes \nthrough the board  tha=\r\nt the participants are not privy too - for instance, I had \na spirit once  =\r\nbring through a name in Hebrew, which looked like garbage to \nme until I be=\r\ngan  to research it further. This also does not account for \nthe events whi=\r\nch  sometimes happen in the environment itself - with ghost \nboxes, don&#39;t y=\r\nou often  feel environmental changes as it is used? \n \nAs for Bloody Mary, =\r\ncertainly it is considered folklore but then legends  \nand folklore do have=\r\n some basis in reality. Occult practices from around the  \nworld have used =\r\nmirrors as a scrying tool for spirit communication. Again, \nit  comes down =\r\nto intension. \n \nI am certainly open to the possibility that nothing happen=\r\ns when these  \ndevices or rituals are conducted - but also are open to the =\r\nwhat if  something \ndoes. This is why I am researching all facets of these =\r\nexperiences  among \nothers - also planning to do some extensive experimenta=\r\ntion around such  \nevents to see what scientific data can be collected.\n \nD=\r\nwayne Claud\n \n \nIn a message dated 4/20/2010 10:07:56 A.M.

But this is only one categor=\r\ny of Ouija  \ninteractions. There is\nanother completely different category w=\r\nhere no operator is touching the  \nboard or the planchette,\nand yet it move=\r\ns and remains in motion, often changing directions or  \nflying off the boar=\r\nd. This\ntype of activity is more akin to psychokinesis, the mind affecting =\r\nthe  \nenvironment.\n \nBoth types of activity could be mediated in the mind o=\r\nf a living  operator, \nand in fact modern\nparapsychology research suggest t=\r\nhis is the most reasonable  explanation. \nBut again the \nsource of the info=\r\nrmation thus presented is at question and is  currently \nunknown.\n \nAgainst=\r\n this backdrop it would seem that it would be quite difficult to  \ndemonstr=\r\nate with\nany clarity or precision that any specific individual (living or  =\r\ndeceased) \nwas indeed affecting\nthe Ouija (or any other device for that mat=\r\nter). It would all come down  to \nbeliefs which is the\nbest we can hope for=\r\n at this time.\n \nSo &#39;scientific&#39; proof per se is off the table if you defin=\r\ne  &#39;scientific&#39; \nin the classic sense.\nIf you mean objective proof, in some=\r\n way documenting activity such as  by \nvideo for example,\nthat is a differe=\r\nnt matter. But to be very clear, this would not be  \nconsidered scientific =\r\nproof\nbecause you are cannot demonstrate the causation. You can however  do=\r\ncument \nthe effect.\n \nBlood Mary (the ritual of Mary Worth) is considered b=\r\ny most to be  \nfolk-legend. So it would \nbe difficult, would it not, to asc=\r\nertain who in fact you were  \ncommunicating with. And again, \nthere is a re=\r\nal possiblity, based on existing lab research from  the past \nmany decades =\r\nthat \nyou just might be communicating with yourself.\n \nBest of luck in your=\r\n endeavors!\n \n-------\n \n\nHey guys,\n\nI am doing some research on the Bloody =\r\n Mary ritual and Ouija Boards. I am  \nlooking for anyone with stories  or e=\r\nxperiences from those that would be \nwilling  to share them - as  well as a=\r\nny research and evidence you may have \ngathered from  them.
