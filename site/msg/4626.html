<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Deb,

Sorry to hear you were ill at The Stanley conference.  I, too, was at 
The Stanley when Mark Macy spoke there; afterwards he took polaroid 
photos of us with the luminator.  The photos were interesting; some 
of them looked like mere double exposures, others did show what could 
be the superimposition of another face from another dimension. I&#x27;m 
new to visual ITC, so the jury&#x27;s out on this one for now!

&gt; Wow, I&#x27;m loving all this information, it&#x27;s giving me a lot of 
ideas.  
&gt; Very exciting for me!
&gt; 
&gt; Does Mark Macy belong to this forum too? I met him about 3 years 
ago.  
&gt; My husband is a commercial photographer and Mark asked him to do 
his  
&gt; portrait for a book he was coming out with. He came to our home 
studio  
&gt; for the portrait, and I got to talk with him a little about what 
he  
&gt; does. At that time all I knew of EVP was from the White Noise 
movie,  
&gt; wasn&#x27;t sure it was real. But Mark was very nice, passionate about 
ITC/ 
&gt; EVP and very convincing. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect when I  
&gt; originally heard what he did, with all the loonies out there 
claiming  
&gt; all kinds of stuff, but I got a really good feeling from him and 
he&#x27;s  
&gt; very, well, like I said, convincing. After that I went to his web 
site  
&gt; and also bought one of his books, which was a nice read.
&gt; 
&gt; I went to the Stanley Hotel in November with a ghost hunting group 
and
&gt; Mark was a speaker there. I was really looking forward to his 
lecture,  
&gt; but ended up with a wicked stomach virus and had to come home 
early. I  
&gt; missed just about everything that weekend!

&gt; &gt; Oops.  I forgot to answer: No, I have not given up ghost hunting 
at  
&gt; &gt; all, but over the years I have come to focus more on the 
collection  
&gt; &gt; and distribution of experiences than on encountering phenomena  
&gt; &gt; myself.  ITC has really affirmed this for me.
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve felt all along that my job is to make people aware that  
&gt; &gt; spiritual phenomena go on all the time in millions of lives; I&#x27;m 
not  
&gt; &gt; a scientist and I know nothing I do will change the way science  
&gt; &gt; thinks.  BUT if I can open the minds of young people today, 
perhaps  
&gt; &gt; our future scientists will make it their business to figure all 
this  
&gt; &gt; out.
&gt; &gt; I know this is a lot of what ITC experimenters are doing: 
convincing  
&gt; &gt; others of the afterlife by their recorded evidence.  Amazing 
things  
&gt; &gt; can happen when THAT happens.
&gt; &gt; Again, Mark Macy is so wonderful because he has dedicated his 
life  
&gt; &gt; to this.  He and his colleagues have received such detailed  
&gt; &gt; descriptions of how the afterlife works, that they have helped 
the  
&gt; &gt; living change their lives to erase the fear of death--and to live 
in  
&gt; &gt; a way that brings us to as high a spiritual level as possible 
right  
&gt; &gt; away when our bodies die.  This means, for example, dealing with  
&gt; &gt; issues and addictions, that plague us in life, since the spirits  
&gt; &gt; tell us we take it all with us!  That is, death isn&#x27;t a cure-all.
&gt; &gt; Any glimpse at the history of ITC shows us that all of this has 
been  
&gt; &gt; gradually growing since the 19th century, when state-of-the-art  
&gt; &gt; graphite pencils and telegraphs were used to contact the dead.   
&gt; &gt; Since then, there have been &quot;breakthroughs&quot; a number of times 
when  
&gt; &gt; astounding floods of messages have come through.
&gt; &gt; You experimenters are all so incredible--I&#x27;m amazed every day at  
&gt; &gt; your love, dedication and faith.  Surely something wonderful is  
&gt; &gt; going to come from all this, and I think it&#x27;s going to come 
during  
&gt; &gt; our lifetimes.

&gt; &gt; Yes, I did steal that phrase from Ursula because I thought it

be  
&gt; &gt; doing!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I like what you said about focus on the equipment helping to  
&gt; &gt; establish the psychic connection.  It makes so much sense.  This  
&gt; &gt; discussion has definitely shown me that mental tools and 
preparation  
&gt; &gt; are as important as physical ones.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank you for your input.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Robin,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Your phrase of &quot;ritualized vs. random&quot; is interesting. There 
are  
&gt; &gt; many
&gt; &gt; &gt; who believe that communication is between the conscious of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; researcher and the entity and the equipment is secondary. It&#x27;s  
&gt; &gt; easy to
&gt; &gt; &gt; get swept up in the technology and forget there is possibly a  
&gt; &gt; psychic
&gt; &gt; &gt; connection going on. With that said, focusing on equipment 
actually
&gt; &gt; &gt; can help the researcher become receptive to establishing a
&gt; &gt; &gt; communication link. While paying attention to the equipment, 
we  
&gt; &gt; forget
&gt; &gt; &gt; about the daily distractions and minor irritations that may  
&gt; &gt; prevent us
&gt; &gt; &gt; from establishing contact.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The setting up the gear we use could be considered the first 
part of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;ritual&quot;. I like to clear my mind, set up equipment, mess 
with  
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; some more, then I am mentally prepare to begin what I hope will 
be a
&gt; &gt; &gt; successful session.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess &quot;random&quot; recording to me would be what happens in the 
field
&gt; &gt; &gt; during a paranormal investigation. I don&#x27;t bring Box 
technology  
&gt; &gt; into a
&gt; &gt; &gt; location with the intention of possibly contacting lingering 
spirits
&gt; &gt; &gt; at that location but I do bring audio recorders in hopes of  
&gt; &gt; recording
&gt; &gt; &gt; evp&#x27;s.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I find the Box works perhaps even better when I&#x27;m in a 
familiar  
&gt; &gt; place
&gt; &gt; &gt; like the room in my home that is designated for that purpose. I 
do
&gt; &gt; &gt; desire to have the finest Box technology that is possible but 
more
&gt; &gt; &gt; important is the association that seems to occur between the
&gt; &gt; &gt; researcher and the Box that is favored. Despite some of the 
benefits
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the new gear, the one that I seem to have a connection with 
is  
&gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; that requires a little more finesse to operate. -Bill

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wow, thanks for your help guys!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ursula, your post was lovely. I&#x27;ve been promising myself to 
learn
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more about Mark Macy&#x27;s work and will check out his website 
ASAP.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ritualized versus random recording makes sense to me now, as 
I  
&gt; &gt; want
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to accomplish true communication rather than continue being  
&gt; &gt; verbally
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; abused. Have you given up &quot;ghost hunting&quot; altogether?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve been looking at the Olympus VN-4100 PC, Zack! I don&#x27;t 
know  
&gt; &gt; if I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need that much recording time, but I sure have liked the one 
I  
&gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wouldn&#x27;t mind upgrading a bit.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Frank! I basically follow your suggestion when recording, 
and  
&gt; &gt; once
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I learned to be quiet I actually started getting responses. 
I  
&gt; &gt; think
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the entities at my house got tired of playing with me 
though,  
&gt; &gt; and now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they aren&#x27;t saying anything. I kind of miss them, but I do 
feel  
&gt; &gt; it&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time to move on.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Robin,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Radio Shack now carries the Olympus VN-4100PC at about the 
same
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; price I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paid for my VN-960PC a couple years ago. I&#x27;ve been very 
happy  
&gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 960. The 4100 has about 4 times the recording time, I 
think.  
&gt; &gt; That
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make it about 24 hours.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m new to the group but probably know some of you from  
&gt; &gt; another
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; list. I haven&#x27;t been too active in the realm of EVP 
recording
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recently, but have had what I consider excellent results 
in  
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; past
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using my little refurbished Ebay-bargain Olympus VN-120 
PC.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m anxious to start recording again and am feeling pretty
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overwhelmed by the technology you all seem to be using. 
I  
&gt; &gt; know a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little about using good headphones and denoiser programs, 
but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beyond
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I&#x27;m electronically challenged. Still, I wonder if 
there  
&gt; &gt; are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simple techniques I can experiment with to increase my  
&gt; &gt; success. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think I&#x27;m a little bored.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve felt pretty strongly that I&#x27;ve been communicating 
with  
&gt; &gt; a very
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small number of entities, and I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s due 
to  
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limitations of my equipment. My most impressive EVPs 
have  
&gt; &gt; always
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; captured around my own home, particularly outside on the  
&gt; &gt; hill and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near the barn. I&#x27;ve gotten two inside my house (after 
inviting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been negative
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messages.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#x27;m thinking about getting another DVR and would  
&gt; &gt; love to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your thoughts and recommendations about which ones are 
best. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like to communicate with more advanced entities 
eventually,  
&gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunately don&#x27;t have the brain for building anything  
&gt; &gt; myself.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!
