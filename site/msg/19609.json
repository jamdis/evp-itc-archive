I got this\n&gt; camera from my sister; years ago, she paid someone to modify it into a full\n&gt; spectrum camera (she&#39;s a photographer & wanted to do some artsy-type photos\n&gt; in full spectrum).  As to the mechanics of converting it, I think he\n&gt; basically removed the hot mirror filter that blocked the IR and UV light\n&gt; spectrums.  Hope this helps.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Sharon from S.F.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
