[EVP-ITC] Re: File uploading rules DO NOT UPLOAD WAV FILES


      LOL Snow=
fire! Nope it was not you this time. Others should read before they post be=
cause we just addressed this subject. Esnips is very easy to use it has two=
 uploading options in case you cant use the java application use the single=
 file uploader. Works alot like email upload attachments.

      If you nee=
d more help just holler and I am sure one of us will be more than willing t=
o help you figure it out. Posting from email as an attachment also works ju=
st not so well for the very large file sizes. There are many other file sha=
ring storage places besides esnips. We just like the layout there and the a=
bility to share with friends including sharing storage space.
