<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have a Trifield Natural EMF meter. It does not respond to 60 Hz fields.
The problem I have with it is that it is too darned sensitive. It registers
the magnetic field of the earth in magnetic and combination mode and
whenever I turn or move too quickly, the meter flicks. If I run it in
electric field mode it does not do this but I&#x27;m always afraid of missing
something, so I generally run it in combination mode.

&gt; Like Zack said, nobody knows for sure.  The only thing that we do know is
&gt; that there is a correlation between spikes in EMF&#x27;s and paranormal events.
&gt;  I have used various meters during GB sessions and there is a correlation at
&gt; times, but this has to be discounted solely because a radio uses part of the
&gt; EMF spectrum.
&gt;
&gt; It is theorized that EMF measurements are to be taken solely in DC current
&gt; because it is natural electricity.  So any EMF meter you have that measures
&gt; AC is worthless on an investigation because it picks up man made
&gt; electricity.  As for the range, well that is also speculative at best.  The
&gt; most current theories hold that under 30 Hz DC is where you will find the
&gt; most paranormal activity.  This is because the Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta
&gt; brainwaves of a human are all below 30 Hz.  This is where the Body Electric
&gt; fires and consciousness is formed.  If we are dealing with a continuation of
&gt; consciousness, results are more apt to be found in this range.
&gt;  Interestingly enough, the earth vibrates in this same range with 5 standing
&gt; waves at or below 33Hz (Shuman Resonance), so it appears that the new agers
&gt; are right when they say we vibrate with the Earth.
&gt;
&gt; But, as always, no one knows for sure.  And no one knows if these
&gt; frequencies have anything to do with what we receive in GBC.

&gt;&gt; This has probably already been discussed a hundred times over by people
&gt;&gt; building ghost boxes, but... what&#x27;s the average emf range of ghosts... and
&gt;&gt; would creating sounds in that emf range make it easier for the ghosts to
&gt;&gt; communicate? And would it be possible to make those sounds heard somehow?

I is heo ized ha EMF measu emen s a e o be aken solely in DC cu en because i is na u al elec ici y.  So any EMF me e you ha e ha measu es AC is wo hless on an in es iga ion because i picks up man made elec ici y.  As o he ange, well ha is also specula i e a bes .  The mos cu en heo ies hold ha unde 30 Hz DC is whe e you will ind he mos pa ano mal ac i i y.  This is because he Del a, The a, Alpha, and Be a b ainwa es o a human a e all below 30 Hz.  This is whe e he Body Elec ic i es and consciousness is o med.  I we a e dealing wi h a con inua ion o consciousness, esul s a e mo e ap o be ound in his ange.  In e es ingly enough, he ea h ib a es in his same ange wi h 5 s anding wa es a o below 33Hz (Shuman Resonance), so i appea s ha he new age s a e igh when hey say we ib a e wi h he Ea h.
