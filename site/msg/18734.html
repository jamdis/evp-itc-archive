<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Do you find that you get more information when there are MORE stations that pick up or LESS stations that pick up?

Also, are you using it on FM or AM stations?


I am getting conflicting information so I wanted to ask here... 

We seem to get a LOT of responses in our home. Although I am very weary to play with it here. I was &quot;warned&quot; to not do it on our home as it will increase activity in our home I was &quot;told&quot; and bring the bad things we had issues with back into the house and I DO NOT want to experience that again (nor do my children..)

We went on an investigation Friday and I got two things.. One I can barely make out.
Then we went on another investigation on Saturday and I didn&#x27;t get much.. IT also seemed to irritate other investigators that we had it on (even though we were told go for it by the head of the group etc to try it out..) I had more info at home sitting playing with it before we left even though I frown upon doing it in our house after being &quot;warned&quot; not do to it. My mom was there and she didn&#x27;t believe it in so I did it to show her and she believed in it by the time we were done 10 mins later.. lol



Thanks for your input!</pre>
