I don&#39;t think &#39;air&#39; means soundwaves in this case.  And I&#39;m in agreement with \nyou, that I don&#39;t think sound is the key in the technique (though I suspect it to be with the \nPortuguese crowd babble background and Voice 2000s DA300 recorder combo.)\n\nI&#39;m going to try to get more specific answers about what exactly &#39;air&#39; is from Arthur&#39;s \nperspective.  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Margaret,\n&gt; \n&gt; could &#39;air&#39; perhaps mean &#39;sound waves&#39;?

On this one, I believe it \nsays, &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; will get us AIR speech.&quot;  I have repeatedly been told with this method that &#39;air&#39; has \n&gt; &gt; something to do with the communication.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Not sure what Arthur&#39;s definition of &#39;air&#39; is, but it is definitely key to what is taking \nplace.  \n&gt; &gt; He&#39;s used terms and phrases like &quot;Air-to-air&quot; - &quot;Air Ports&quot; - &quot;Air Portals&quot; - &quot;Helps you \n&gt; &gt; enter our air&quot; - &quot;They&#39;ll give you air to us&quot; - &quot;I have air&quot; etc.  MANY references.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Margaret\n&gt;"}
