&gt; &gt;  Not wanting to sound negative, but are we supposed to take that as saying
&gt; &gt; no one is supposed to use newer technology? Even what I do with the boxes is
&gt; &gt; surppassed by the new comers, and they get more better results, so why hang
&gt; &gt; on to the old stuff?

&gt; &gt; &gt;  . . . . . . . . &gt;&gt;  Hi Frank, and All,  NO, No No!  I did not mean my posting to be negative, what I meant was to let people who would like to know more about what has been done &amp; is being done + history of getting EVPs (&amp; ITC&#x27;s)is all about (which DOES include your Boxes, to ya know, as there are many people who are interested IN EVPs/ITCs, but don&#x27;t know certain things about it!  I have a friend in Illinois who would like to try getting EVPs, but really has little knowledge of it&#x27;s history or various ways to do this kind of experimental work/research!  Hope I&#x27;ve cleared this up, so it&#x27;s better understood!  I hope THIS site is NOT only for &quot;Frank&#x27;s Boxes&quot; but others as well.  Thanks.  =Judy=

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just thought I&#x27;d drop in to let you know Tom emailed me regarding Sarah
&gt; &gt; &gt; Estep&#x27;s TEAC A 6300 reel to reel tape recorder, she used with a standard
&gt; &gt; &gt; dynamic mic, plus told me www.AAEVP.com &lt;http://www.aaevp.com/&gt; is now
&gt; &gt; &gt; www.ATransC.org &lt;http://www.atransc.org/&gt;, so thought you all should know
&gt; &gt; &gt; - for more researching info.! PEACE! =Judy=
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
Well, Here was my reply, but I doubt anyone came to check it out, nor went to the site I posted - for referance/history - info.!  Oh, well.  =Judy=</pre>
