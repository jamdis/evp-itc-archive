Hello everyone,

I kind of figured that since this group was the first one=
 that I ever
talked to about my entrance into the unexplained and EVP, I fi=
gured I
would give an update. I will be the first to contest that what you =
hear
is something that's definitely there. After I continued to get nothing=

but negative experiences during my EVP, I decided to just forget it.
Well =
the things messing with me have not really agreed with me on that.

Just la=
st Friday, I went to a party of my friends and I took a picture
of somethin=
g odd. This is a real picture folks and I challenge anyone to
find a made u=
p flaw in it. The first one circles the entities and the
second one is just=
 the original file. I know this doesn't pertain
much to the EVP realm, but =
it's a follow up from an experience of
one, which now proves the legitimacy=
 off this field=85..pictures
always speak a thousand words.

I really would=
 like to think that I am too stubborn for anything even
more serious to hap=
pen, as I am just considering them a nuisance now. I
will be seeking a high=
er power either today or very soon. If you guys
don't hear from me again, I=
 just may be possessed=85.<gulps>

ird even trying to explain this story because about a <BR>> week ago I w=
ould have thought of it as silly. About a year ago I met <BR>> someone e=
lse, who for now ill call B. I fell madly in love with her <BR>> and aft=
er a short time I was more than happy to have her come and <BR>> live wi=
th me at my new place. In some strange way I always felt as if <BR>> the=
re was something about B I could never quite understand. After <BR>> abo=
ut 3-4 months of living with her I started to get the inclination <BR>> =
that B was cheating on me. Her stories never added up, her job was <BR>>=
 secretive and she started stumbling on her words a lot. <BR>> <BR>> =
I then started getting spy gadgets, because she was staying with me <BR>>=
; and I was concerned about my place along with her activities there. I <BR=
>> at first just got a digital recorder, but then after time I started <=
BR>> to get aggravated and felt that the digital recordings were just <B=
R>> being used to play and taunt me. So then I went to the extent of <BR=
>> getting Cameras and even Camcorders. Whenever I would ask about <BR>&=
gt; something peculiar, I got tears and a really heartfelt reaction that <B=
R>> really made me believe her. I felt like we really loved one another =
<BR>> and I could really see some care in her eyes, so most of the time =
I <BR>> just gave in to what she said as true, but didnt have enough to =
stop <BR>> looking. I felt like I had been in enough relationships to kn=
ow the <BR>> difference here. I have seen the act before and it really d=
idn't look <BR>> that way here, unless she was just really that good at =
fooling <BR>> people. <BR>> <BR>> During the course of our stay th=
ere she would pitch a huge fit if I <BR>> had to leave her at the apartm=
ent alone and would stop at nothing to <BR>> try and be in my company in=
stead. But I started to get aggravated as <BR>> time progressed and knew=
 something was up, because of the odd voices <BR>> I would hear within t=
he recordings. I made her stay there will trying <BR>> to sneak back and=
 see who was messing with her around my place. I <BR>> lost it because I=
 couldn't pinpoint it at all and last July and got <BR>> into a fight ri=
ght outside of my place with three other people. She <BR>> always told m=
e she talked to her self when I qestioned other voices <BR>> and I never=
 could see anyone else there when she did, even with the <BR>> cameras, =
so I had no choice but to continue on believeing her still=85=85<BR>> ev=
en though my feelings wouldn't agree to her words. <BR>> <BR>> For so=
me odd reason it just seemed as if she knew where the cameras <BR>> and =
recorders were every time, just by the way she would exit and <BR>> ente=
r the apartment. So then I started putting them outside and about <BR>> =
a month ago something crazy happened. I started listening to a <BR>> dig=
ital recording and at the beginning of it I flat out heard B <BR>> cheat=
ing on me with someone. I was upset and happy at the same time <BR>> tha=
t I finally had caught it and as a result I sent her away. She <BR>> lef=
t town because all her family was in another city. She couldn't <BR>> st=
op crying and was hysterical, especially when she saw I was <BR>> devast=
ated too. I thought that I had finally gotten my answers and <BR>> she w=
as just the best actress I had ever known, end of story. She <BR>> tried=
 to kill herself a couple of times while this was going on a <BR>> coupl=
e months back. If it was as an act or not, I really just don't <BR>> kno=
w. But when she left last she left a note telling me not to let <BR>> he=
r die and she hopes that I find her soon before her heart stopped. <BR>>=
 Me=85..I said more BS and threw the note in the garbage. <BR>> <BR>>=
 A couple of day's later curiosity got the best of me and I started <BR>>=
; listening to the rest of the recording. I then started to hear what <BR>&=
gt; sounded like people monitoring ME and calling me a "Threat". I <BR>>=
 immediately start acting alarmed. Then in the recording I hear B exit <BR>=
> the apartment in disgust after I stormed off that night, as we were <B=
R>> fighting about something weird yet again. After I had left she <BR>&=
gt; started talking about setting up a "Private Meeting" with some other <B=
R>> people and something about boating. Well during the beginning of thi=
s <BR>> meeting I heard a reference to a crazy accusation that I had mad=
e at <BR>> B awhile ago, which to me at the time confirmed she was in th=
e Mafia. <BR>> That explained all the weirdness to me and during this me=
eting the <BR>> voices changed a bunch as if they sounded "Masked" or "D=
isguised", so <BR>> I really had to amp up the volume. <BR>> <BR>>=
 The next day and every day after from this point on I amped up the <BR>>=
; volume in the recording. I also had to distinguish the masked voice <BR>&=
gt; by breaking the large file into smaller segments of two to four <BR>>=
; second intervals, in order to piece the entire recordings meaning <BR>>=
; together. Over time I started to interpret the masked voices better <BR>&=
gt; because I thought I was tuning my ears better to them. The voices in <B=
R>> these recordings were two different males, B and some other female. =
I <BR>> later on saw in the recording that they had actually seen the <B=
R>> recording but weren't taking it, which was EXTREMELY odd to me <BR>&=
gt; considering they had been caught. Why not destroy the evidence? <BR>>=
; <BR>> Then I heard one of the males say that he was the "Boss of the <=
BR>> Southwest Mafia" and that I was going to pay for hurting B like thi=
s. <BR>> He also said that my being a nuisance in the apartment had mess=
ed up <BR>> his business within the area and all my spy stuff had really=
 pissed <BR>> him off. He told me I was dead, my daughter along with me =
and more <BR>> than likely my whole family as well. <BR>> <BR>> He=
 knew where my mom and dad lived and some information I didn't even <BR>>=
; tell B. I freak out and figure the damn mob is after me. I keep <BR>> =
listening and he says "If I don't move away and discontinue my <BR>> int=
eractions with my daughter by December 5th, that he would know <BR>> tha=
t I was just playing with B and then my whole family is dead". <BR>> Thi=
s was exactly one month from when I had used the recording device <BR>> =
too by the way. I moved out and away from my daughter breaking the <BR>>=
 tie and in tears the whole time too because I couldnt explain why. I <BR>&=
gt; really did it because I feared for their lives of my family and felt <B=
R>> that we would all die if f I didnt. <BR>> <BR>> Meanwhile B an=
d met someone else that ill name J for now. After <BR>> knowing him for =
two days she decided to bring him back with her to <BR>> pick up her thi=
ngs out of the apartment. I was kicking her out of it <BR>> by the way. =
I thought it was just to piss me off and I forgot about <BR>> it. Then I=
 heard as I progressed in the recording J's name brought <BR>> up. Suppo=
sedly they knew him and he was in their mob and I needed to <BR>> go att=
ack him to prove myself, or else B will never be seen from me <BR>> agai=
n. I also hear that I can't go to certain places at certain times <BR>> =
where B might be and furthermore think that they didnt take the <BR>> re=
corder because the damn thing has to be planned down to the times I <BR>>=
; would hear it. <BR>> <BR>> At this time I am in fear for my life an=
d my families, lost my love <BR>> and I am not understanding how the rec=
ording is so damn well time <BR>> planned, figured im going crazy. Then =
something ill never forget <BR>> happens. I am spoken directly too and I=
 figure its me going of the <BR>> deep end now. I try and test my sanity=
 and go to different parts of <BR>> the recording only to get the same t=
hing kind of direct question. I <BR>> am in disarray at this point! I st=
and up and walk around, trying to <BR>> figure out just what the hell is=
 going on with me. I get back on and <BR>> further see that my verbal qu=
estions are now being answered instantly <BR>> by this recording (Which =
is merely a sound file on the pc). *I was <BR>> using Sound Forge by the=
 way if anyone wanted to know what sound <BR>> software I was using was*=
.<BR>> <BR>> I have so little sleep at this point and I am told that =
I need to do <BR>> all this crazy stuff and drive out to the middle of s=
ome hotel right <BR>> then and there, to further see them, as I have pas=
sed all their tests <BR>> to get into their mafia now. As a reward B wou=
ld be there waiting for <BR>> me too. I hurry to do it and rush there bu=
t no one is even their to <BR>> answer the door. I go back and get a yel=
ling voice at me that I had <BR>> left to early and immediatly go back. =
Me not wanting to piss the mob <BR>> boss anymore, I take the 45 minute =
trip again and go back. But when I <BR>> get there it just didn't feel r=
ight to me and I never exited the car, <BR>> especially when I saw the n=
umbers in vehicles hadnt changed in the <BR>> parking lot. I had plenty =
reason to be paranoid at this point and <BR>> truly felt in danger.I lef=
t and thought I was done for when I got <BR>> back. Instead, he tells me=
 that he was impressed by my decision when <BR>> and literally puts me i=
n tears when he said that because of my <BR>> intelligence, I had won my=
 families lives back, but not my own yet. <BR>> <BR>> All this is don=
e by him also telling me that he can physically see me <BR>> through his=
 advanced mafia technology on the computer monitor. He <BR>> also tells =
me to to move things around on my compter desk that were <BR>> between t=
he sight of me and the computer monitor, while demanding I <BR>> correct=
 my posture when speaking to him. He also states that he is <BR>> watchi=
ng my every move and if I tell anyone anything they die along <BR>> with=
 me. <BR>> <BR>> I make no sense of this and I was completely baffled=
 on how I was <BR>> being communicated with. I had just moved and there =
was no internet <BR>> connection even. Me just being happy my family is =
safe, I decide to <BR>> go to sleep. Feeling as though I am now sleep de=
prived and going <BR>> crazy from the stress, I go to sleep for two days=
 consistently, as <BR>> this was during the Thanksgiving holiday time. I=
 would purposely make <BR>> myself sleep longer when I woke to ensure I =
didn't belong in the <BR>> loony bin. <BR>> <BR>> When I finally w=
oke up I was determined to find an explanation to how <BR>> they were ta=
lking to me, I go to the library and look into Bluetooth <BR>> technolog=
y, telephony, and remoting into a computer=85..anything. Then <BR>> I re=
alize=85=85..that I can find out just how crazy I really am by moving <BR>&=
gt; the recording and listening to it elsewhere. I then decide to take <BR>=
> the same recording into my work to test my saneness, along with the <B=
R>> file itself. If its was on my home CPU=85.then it's going to now be =
at <BR>> my work one too right? I do and get the same damn thing, not to=
 <BR>> mention that the "Mob Boss" now has company two others when I spe=
ak <BR>> to him. All of them yelling at me for moving their sensive <BR>=
> information. <BR>> <BR>> During this time I invest in GPS, GSM, =
3G and several signal blocking <BR>> devices, in order to prohibit mysel=
f from being tracked any further. <BR>> They never worked or even phased=
 the "Mob Boss". But I would still <BR>> check the recording in the even=
ing just to hear what I needed to do <BR>> in order to be making them ha=
ppy and get the possibility to see B <BR>> again. The "Mob Boss" had tol=
d me that it was all just a test for me <BR>> to see if I loved her and =
she never really did do anything. They <BR>> continue to tell me over an=
d over that I have to beat up J in order <BR>> to prove myself to B. Tha=
t this is what everyone is really waiting on <BR>> and if I would just g=
o up to the other town and get it over with, <BR>> then I can bring her =
back with me. I won't do it and say that I won't <BR>> fight for anythin=
g that doesn't want to be fought for. Basically <BR>> saying that B can =
call me about it if she really wants it. Then as a <BR>> result they sta=
rt threatening my family again. At this point, I <BR>> really can't even=
 express to you how much of a wreck I am. But I felt <BR>> like I needed=
 to be strong for my family and get on the mob's good <BR>> side so I ca=
n fix the mess I created.<BR>> <BR>> Well it never really happened an=
d this torment went on for a good <BR>> week, while I was moving everyth=
ing I could as fast as I could in <BR>> order to make their deadline and=
 save everyone. Everyday I would do <BR>> what I thought was expected of=
 me and hope it wouldnt make them mad <BR>> in one breath, while in the =
other breath win back my complete <BR>> freedom, away from their bad sid=
e. No matter where I was or what I <BR>> did during the day they usually=
 seemed to know about it when I talked <BR>> to them in the evening. It =
really bothered me that I couldnt find out <BR>> where they were putting=
 the "bugs", or even better how they were <BR>> doing all of it. My inab=
ility to "believe" in the paranormal really <BR>> hurt me here.<BR>> =
<BR>> Since the apartment that B and I had used was empty at this time a=
nd <BR>> a friend of mine was down on his luck, I gave him the apartment=
 for <BR>> free until the lease was completely up. After about a week of=
 me <BR>> doing this, I walked in and found guns and ammo everywhere and=
 <BR>> freaked the hell out. That's the last thing I needed when I thoug=
ht <BR>> the mob was just down the street! I made everyone there except =
my <BR>> friend leave, with quite a fuss I might add. Then I headed back=
 to my <BR>> home to see how the mob felt about what I did, assure they =
would be <BR>> impressed that I had looked out for them. Instead the reg=
ular female <BR>> that was always with the "Mob Boss" now asked me why I=
 didn't finish <BR>> the job, stating that there was still someone there=
 and it made them <BR>> all angry. They demanded that I go back especial=
ly to see just how "I <BR>> finished it". <BR>> <BR>> So like the =
puppet I was at that time, I went back. I didn't have the <BR>> heart to=
 put him on the street, even though he had put me at a major <BR>> risk =
and instead I just found another place for him to stay. On the <BR>> way=
 there I bought him some water and some smokes. When we got there <BR>> =
I even helped him move in and explained that it wasn't me that did <BR>>=
 it, but the leasing office had saw all the guns. As a result they had <BR>=
> made me do it. I thought he made a poor decision and I knew he saw <BR=
>> the same, not to mention I kind of felt bad that I had to do all of <=
BR>> this to him at 11:30PM. I truly didnt want to make his life a <BR>&=
gt; complete hell any more than it already was and he felt better that I <B=
R>> had talked to him, so as a result I did as well. I then left and onc=
e <BR>> again headed back home. <BR>> <BR>> Certain that I was goi=
ng to get good praises; I sat at the PC again <BR>> only to immediately =
get yelled at. They asked me why I was "so good" <BR>> and that they had=
 absolutely no respect for me. I tell them I just <BR>> did all of that =
for them and they say that I always do things "the <BR>> right way" and =
they hate me for it. This is where I think I hit the <BR>> loony bin and=
 just didnt see how I was going to fix this problem. <BR>> Then it got w=
orse and saw that my thoughts were now being <BR>> communicated back to =
me. Then I knew it and was convinced I was going <BR>> skitzo and that i=
 was just truly arguing with myself in reality, <BR>> especially when I =
saw I wasn't even speaking. I used the restroom, <BR>> splash water on m=
y face and faintly start to hear the same mob people <BR>> in my fan mot=
or in the bathroom. I haven't drank, done any drugs <BR>> (even prescrip=
tion) and have a pretty complex job which I can still <BR>> handle, but =
yet I feel like I am going crazy. <BR>> <BR>> I can't talk to anyone =
about it so I sit back at the CPU, only to <BR>> hear that I need to ope=
n up the front door. Screw that!=85I just look <BR>> out the window and =
see nothing and say no way. They ask why not and <BR>> that I should tru=
st them and I say hell no and I continue to <BR>> hear "God Damnit" from=
 them when they get mad. They continue to ask <BR>> me to open the door =
and I continue to check the window to see <BR>> nothing. I say to knock =
then and they get mad and say they have no <BR>> hands. They don't sound=
 like they are joking and get mad when I laugh <BR>> even, so I continue=
 to think I am just crazy at this point. I asked <BR>> why they wanted t=
o come in and they said they wanted to fix me. I say <BR>> there is noth=
ing wrong with me and they say they hate me and want to <BR>> eat me.<BR=
>> <BR>> I start to really think about this and say ill open the door=
 if I get <BR>> the answers to all this. They start saying things and it=
s if as <BR>> though they see my thought process develop and say things =
like=85"watch <BR>> him go". Then I hear out of my computer monitor some=
thing I couldnt <BR>> even fathom. I hear my ex-wife's ex-best friends v=
oice. His name was <BR>> Daniel and he had committed suicide over 5 year=
s ago. I did know him, <BR>> but not as well as she had. It WAS his voic=
e and he said "Charles its <BR>> Daniel" and then I heard their voice ag=
ain say we are "down here with <BR>> him". At this point I didnt know re=
ally what to think, but this part <BR>> in our conversation was the turn=
ing point on my beliefs and thoughts <BR>> on what was really going on. =
<BR>> <BR>> I say nothing yet they somehow can seem to hear my though=
ts and start <BR>> saying little things to make me think even more. It w=
as the most <BR>> fluent conversation I had ever had. It was truly telep=
athic and was <BR>> on a level I could never really explain even to myse=
lf. Then it <BR>> really hit me and I said "Demons". I tried to play som=
ething and got <BR>> no response for the first time ever on the sound fi=
le. I then started <BR>> piecing it all together from there and even tho=
ugh I wasn't a <BR>> believer this makes more sense then I could ever wr=
ite down here and <BR>> as a result I forever will be one now. <BR>> =
<BR>> They ask for me to now open the door and I open the small glass do=
or <BR>> on my CPU desk and they get really pissed off, saying I tricked=
 them. <BR>> Then their voice changed to the most demonic, vile and dist=
urbing <BR>> voice I could ever put into words. I never really thought o=
f doing <BR>> that until that moment and I think it was seen from them r=
eaction, <BR>> but it worked out quite nicely. I start saying the our fa=
ther prayer <BR>> and I can hear the displeasure in them even more and h=
eard "that's it <BR>> we are going in". I immediately took off my headph=
ones and ran to get <BR>> a bible they never did as far as I can tell, b=
ut I sat there all <BR>> night with the bible in my hand praying. <BR>&g=
t; <BR>> I started calling people and my phone started cutting out, the =
bulb <BR>> on the porch blew and my good friend's girlfriend called me t=
o ask me <BR>> for help because my friend was drunk and passed out. It s=
ounded like <BR>> she was trying to flirt with me and I asked her how "A=
" nightclub was <BR>> and she said good and then I said didn't you actua=
lly go to "B" <BR>> nightclub actually and she switches her story. I han=
g up and call <BR>> back with no answer. The time was only 1:10am and th=
ey never leave <BR>> until the clubs close so this was even odder. <BR>&=
gt; <BR>> I sat there terrified most of the night praying, until I calle=
d my <BR>> brother who told me that I have to stand up to them or I am f=
eeding <BR>> into their fear. He like my mom has been involved in simila=
r things <BR>> like this but after talking to both of them, neither have=
 on this <BR>> level. But in a refreshing breath after talking to them a=
bout this, <BR>> they did seem to believe me. But it wasnt unil I resear=
ched this <BR>> issue and found out about EVP and how it works, did I tr=
uly know that <BR>> I wasnt becoming a lunatic.<BR>> <BR>> That br=
ings me to today and me being at my wits end. I swear on <BR>> everythin=
g this is all 100% true and I feel like I am crazy even <BR>> still. Eve=
n though I hear it from no one else and have a pretty good <BR>> circle =
of friends, not to mention that I still seem to do my job just <BR>> fin=
e as well. I havent put on my headphones or heard any voices since <BR>>=
 I tried to last listen to the recording, which was now 3 days ago. <BR>>=
; Does anyone have any help and guidance here, as this all has really <BR>&=
gt; destroyed my life. I deleted all the copies of the recording, except <B=
R>> for one hardcopy. I still have the original recorder with the file <=
BR>> on, but I haven't tried to use the recording or recorder any furthe=
r, <BR>> as I refuse to continue it without any guidance. I figure its b=
est to <BR>> avoid them, like my brother said. Maybe someone can help me=
 <BR>> understand all of this. Even if I have gotten rid of these things=
 <BR>> what does that say of B? I really spent a bunch of time making th=
is <BR>> really need some genuine help from someone in the know. I know =
it <BR>> sounds crazy but please regard this all as true. I am new to th=
is <BR>> stuff and will just stay away from it now, but some kind of ins=
ight <BR>> would be great.<BR>><BR>
