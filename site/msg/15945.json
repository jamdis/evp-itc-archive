It&#39;s nice hearing so \nmany people, saying &quot;I love you&quot; never knew I had so many  friends, it&#39;s \nnice!  sf\n\r\n-------------------------------1252607877\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3DUS-ASCII&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Type&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18812&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot; id=3Drole_body =\r\n\nbottomMargin=3D7 leftMargin=3D7 rightMargin=3D7 topMargin=3D7&gt;&lt;FONT id=3Dr=\r\nole_document \ncolor=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;One of the list m=\r\nember&nbsp;notes that we all seem to be getting better \ncommunications, &quot;&lt;F=\r\nONT style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent&quot; color=3D#000000 \nsize=3D5 face=\r\n=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;communication is starting to move \naway=\r\n from the basic one and two word&nbsp;messages and answers and becoming mor=\r\ne \ndetailed in it&#39;s content.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;I suggest that we all try=\r\n to \ndedicate one certain topic per session and attempt to gather as much i=\r\nnformation \nas we can on that specific topic.&quot;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent&quot; color=3D#000000 size=3D5 \nface=\r\n=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent&quot; color=3D#000000 size=3D5 \nface=3D&quot;Ti=\r\nmes New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;This seems to be a great idea,&nbsp; I \nwonde=\r\nr if me leaving them to watch TV sometimes, and letting them watch the \nbas=\r\neball games of their choice helps, it allows them&nbsp; to practice using t=\r\nhe \nradio for an extended period of time, and talk amongst themselves when =\r\nI am not \nin the same room, once and awhile I will hear them saying somethi=\r\nng about me, or \none is asking another &quot;what is she doing&quot; someone will say=\r\n, &quot;she&#39;s in her room, \non the phone,&quot; sometimes they ask what or when I&#39;m g=\r\noing to fix dinner, or what \nI am cooking.&nbsp; It&#39;s kind of cool, they ca=\r\nn also shut it down when they are \npestered by negative people or abusive&#39;s=\r\n, some of which say they are &quot;in jail&quot; \nover there.&nbsp; Sometimes. they&n=\r\nbsp;want to know, &quot;when will you record&quot; I \nguess, they kind of like lining=\r\n up to say names and such, or they say, as the \nrecording is ending, &quot;it&#39;s =\r\nover all ready&quot; :( in a sad tone of voice.)&nbsp; \nIt&#39;s nice hearing so man=\r\ny people, saying &quot;I love you&quot; never knew I had so many \nfriends, it&#39;s nice!=\r\n&nbsp; sf&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n-------------------------------1252607877--"}
