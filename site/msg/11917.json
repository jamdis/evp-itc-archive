Just a coincidence?\n\nIf we all sit in a theater and watch the same movie, we might like it  \nor not, form 100&#39;s of different opinions about the movie, but the  \nmovie is still real.\n\nNo matter what we do as researchers, there will always be someone to  \nattempt to say what we do isn&#39;t real.\n\nI&#39;ve seen people experience paranormal activity, objects move and 5  \nother people besides them witness the same thing, the exact same  \nthing, only later to hear them later make excuses for what they saw.  \nSo no matter what proof we present, there&#39;s always someone around to  \npoo poo it - usually a person who has never actually researched EVP/ \nITC themselves ever.\n\nw.\nOn Aug 18, 2008, at 1:56 PM, threadsintyme@... wrote:\n\n&gt; BUT...this does not always rule out that the person making the  \n&gt; recording is &quot;interpreting&quot; what they hear.
