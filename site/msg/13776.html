This is an interesting topic thread. I have a few suggestions that might be=
 of interest.
=A0
First let's think about what it is you propose. You want =
to know if movement on a Ouija board is evidence of spirit communication or=
 something else, presumably your own abilities. In order to determine if a =
spirit is involved, you will need a test for a spirit communicator. This im=
plies you know what spirit communicators do. And therein lies the problem. =
We don't know this unfortunately.=A0 Now, we might frame the question diffe=
rently: can we demonstrate if the acitivity is likely the result of motor r=
esponse and if so how? This won't make it possible to say that the results =
come from spirits, but it might be possible at least to rule out most known=
 methods that are attributable to living persons, which would be a start.
=
=A0
We'll begin by putting aside mechanical explanations. To do this we nee=
d to be sure ideomotor response cannot be a possibility. Since ideomotor re=
quires opposing forces in order to work, this means only one operator with =
a single finger of one hand on the planchette. 
What we would really like t=
o see is planchette motion with no contact. This would=A0remove any normal =
physical explanation of the planchette movement. Now we are down to one of =
two possibilities aside from kinetic energy, which can be disestablished by=
 simply waiting. 
=A0
First, the planchette is being moved by some unknown =
psychic force by an individual present in the room, perhaps the operator. S=
econd, the planchette is being moved by some unseen thing (which could incl=
ude a "spirit") that may or may not be using a person in the room or elsewh=
ere as an intermediary. We seek to establish which of these two is more pro=
bable. We do that by seeing if there is any indication that a physical pers=
on in the room is producing anything unexpected.
=A0
Here is where things b=
ecome a bit dicey and for some, problematic. There has been reputable resea=
rch in the field of Parapscyhology that indicates that there are focal peop=
le who participate in psychokinesis (PK), the apparent heart of what is cal=
led 'poltergeist' activity. There is every reason to believe that, if any a=
nomalous planchette movement is occuring, that it too is most likely caused=
 by PK. These focal people have several characteristics, one of which is a =
history of psychophysiological disorders. Unfortunately not everyone who ha=
s these disorders is aware of it. Many also have a belief system that in so=
me way allows them to experience PK activity. Lastly they appear most often=
 to be successful in environments where strong magnetic fields exist.
=A0
T=
his would suggest that the best way to detect a potentil living PK agent as=
 the cause of this activity would be to monitor two types of magnetic field=
s. In the environment it would make sense to test for strong geomagnetic fi=
elds with portable geomagnetometers. These are not inexpensive; the type re=
quired cost about $800 U.S. You can monitor body fields reasonably well usi=
ng a Trifield Natural EM meter. Psychophysiologists have used these relativ=
ely inexpensive meters to find high biofields in humans, often those who ap=
pear to be PK focal people. The key is that a DC meter must be used. Levels=
 have been observed in the 1 to 3 Gauss range. Yes, if you know much about =
human physiology you will know that should be impossible. The physiologists=
 who have reliably made these measurements are as stumped as anyone as to w=
hy they would be that high and cannot explain them either. They simply know=
 that these are replicable and stable readings over decades of
 measurement=
s.
=A0
If you find this type of environment and you find a moving planchett=
e with no one present touching it, you can infer at least beyond a wild gue=
ss, that there may be some evidence for participation by a local individual=
 as opposed to an external entity. You cannot say with complete certainty t=
hat no external entity is involved, but you can say there is a strong indic=
ation that someone locally is probably involved and likely responsible. To =
test this, remove individuals from the area and see if the activity stops. =
Clearly this should be replicated if possible. While replication provides m=
ore certainty of the assumption it will never provide 100% proof, unfortuna=
tely.
=A0
I hope readers find this information useful. I monitor the digest=
s occasionally and will try to answer any inquiries you may have here.
