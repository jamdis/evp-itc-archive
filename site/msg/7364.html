 From Ghostman on the 5th. I've been too busy to spend much time listening=
. For new comers, Ghostman is my version of the Mini Box, a one of a kind t=
est box, as it's based on an older digital Walkman board, and I haven't fou=
nd another. 
 
 There seems to many that want what Moon has, and showed on =
Paranormal State and various public demos. Lets just say his experience and=
 claims with the boxes seems to be unique. I don't sell the boxes, and I do=
n't have to make them on demand, besides, there's certain "flaws" I want to=
 fix before I do anything else.
