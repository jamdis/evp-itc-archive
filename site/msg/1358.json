The audio source file was an all music recording of Theremin music. This was at the end of a long exchange. \n&quot;Spiricom&quot; \nThe word is comprised of Theremin frequencies, there were no vocals in the source recording\nDave\n\n--- vfp19968@... wrote:\n\nFrom: &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] EVP Maker & Optical Link Experiment\nDate: Mon, 11 Jun 2007 03:40:28 -0700\n\n\nI&#39;ve been testing an optical link design that replaces a normal microphone. The link consists of a red LED coupled to the sound source (EVP Maker or Linear radio  sweep) and the resultant modulated light is picked up by a photomultiplier tube.  The output of the tube is recorded on a VHS VCR (analog). Here&#39;s a couple examples from the session using EVP maker.\n\nExample one: &quot;Some people being taught, there&#39;s mentors feeling hope&quot;\n\nExample two English or Scottish accent: &quot;Ultimate test, does he pass it?&quot;\n\nDave\n\n\r\n----__Part.20070611041202.E53A2140\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg\r\nContent-Type: AUDIO/MPEG; name=&quot;060907spiricom (2.1.1).mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;060907spiricom (2.1.1).mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n----__Part.20070611041202.E53A2140--"}
