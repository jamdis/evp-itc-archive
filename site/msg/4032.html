well seeing how my last attempt didnt turn out so great....
   
  next....
   
  LOL but I STILL say its modified right it just broke someplace else due to shoddy wiring.
   
  I accomplished what I set out to do...cant help it if the thing fell to peices once I accomplished it hehehe prolly a 3rd wire popped off someplace that i didnt notice. Didnt yank it apart again. I dont need it anyway, just wanted to "do" then pass it on to someone who wants to "use". Maybe send it to Sumptions radio graveyard he has there in his workshop for a future project.
   
  I got it very cheap, so I wouldnt feel guilty once I tore it up (literally)

Ursula was supposed to recieve the last 470 I had, as curcumstances 
would have it her husband got one for her. She was kind enough to let 
me know so that I could re offer it to someone wishing to get into box 
research.

If your interested please let me know.
