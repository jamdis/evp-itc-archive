I \nhave to work to pay my mortgage like everyone else.  Oh I know=\r\n  some people \ndon&#39;t have to and can sit in their basements all day long an=\r\nd play  with a box. \n But do not ridicule everyone else who has to work and=\r\n cannot  do this on the \nlevel that you do.  And I would even include the p=\r\nerson who  started this \nforum who by the way does work a full-time job.  I=\r\n also  thought this was a \npublic forum?  I guess I was mistaken and have t=\r\no beg  for your permission to be on \nhere and especially to post my respons=\r\ne on this  PUBLIC FORUM?\n \nI have only posted (2) files on here and yes I d=\r\nid get a response from  them. \n Funny how I got an immediate response from =\r\nMr. Sumption about them  but I \nnever got a response from you.  Maybe I sho=\r\nuld of put out an all  points \nbulletin out that I posted theses files on h=\r\nere?  Either way I did  post and I got an \nimmediate response and I was ver=\r\ny flattered that Mr. Sumption  did take his \ntime to listen to them and ack=\r\nnowlegde them and comment.\n \nI do not pretend to be anyone special on this =\r\nforum.  But I do  consider \nmyself a fellow researcher which I take it you =\r\ndo not consider  me.  I really \ndon&#39;t care because those who know me actual=\r\nly know my  capabilities and believe in \nme.  Which we have recently proven=\r\n on a  specific location which cannot be \nnamed at this time.  And just exa=\r\nctly who  do you think you are that you can be \nvoicing your so-called disc=\r\nontent with me  when you do not even know me.  This \nagain is something tha=\r\nt should have  been done in a private email and not on \nthis forum.  This j=\r\nust re-enforces  my personal opinion of certain people in \nthis field claim=\r\ning to do so-called  RESEARCH.\n \nIf you so desire to keep up with this atti=\r\ntude please do it privately.  \nPeople on this forum do not need to see this=\r\n kind of thing on here.    Again I will \nsay that this is suppose to be a P=\r\nUBLIC Forum and if I am mistaken  I wish \nsomeone would please explain it t=\r\no me again.  And would you please  do all of us \na favor and proof-read you=\r\nr posts before you send them.  Your  spelling is \nthat of a 5th grader.  Ar=\r\ne you smarter than a 5th grader?\n \nThis will be my last and only response t=\r\no you regarding this subject.   But I \nwill just state that I do not apprec=\r\niate your bashing of other fellow  \nresearchers on here.  And I am sure tha=\r\nt the other fellow researchers on  this forum \ndo not appreciate it either.=\r\n  So please have a little more  respect for \neveryone on here.\n \nJeff\n \nIn =\r\na message dated 2/8/2008 2:48:11 P.M.
