<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Steve,

I love your box! I would love to have another one with a different type sweep to compare results. I haven&#x27;t been on the lists much, because I have been pretty busy the last few months. I have some experimentimg to do with the paracorder and camera too. 

It&#x27;s been so cold here lately that my space heaters couldn&#x27;t keep up which is unusual here in Middle GA. The cold was draining my batteries. But this weekend we&#x27;re getting temps that are warmer, so I&#x27;m planning on doing some of the experimenting that I&#x27;ve wanted to do since Christmas.

Anyway, if you would like to email me privately about a different box, please do. It&#x27;s a shame that interest has waned. I know money has been tighter in general for me. Maybe it&#x27;s the same for others as well.

&gt; Thanks.  I build very slow, but always try to make something different.  This is another one of a kind sweep.
&gt; 
&gt; Seems there isn&#x27;t much interest in the boxes anymore though.  I make them and stick it in the corner to collect dust.  I put them on EBAY or offer it to the groups, but no response from either.
&gt; 
&gt; That&#x27;s why i don&#x27;t make many anymore, what am i going to do with all of these?
&gt; 
&gt; I get a lot of e-mails for a box, but it&#x27;s all the same thing and frank can attest to this to.
&gt; 
&gt; They want me to build them a box and ship it to them for FREE, usually because they are a TAPS family member or somebody halfway famous in the field.
&gt; 
&gt; I can&#x27;t do that anymore, i ran out of money and frank is retired.

&gt; &gt; I call this circuit a hybrid sweep.  It is a blend of random and linear modes together.  It sweeps in a linear fashion, but has a runaway speed change to it.  Let me know what you guys think of it.
