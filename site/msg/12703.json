I&#39;ll try that... \nthanks.  &quot;Cooking with EVPs Part 2&quot; :-)\n\nThe Faraday cage mentioned in the book was referring to the Raudive \ndiode method. He wanted to make sure to eliminate the possibility of \nRF being detected by his diode input.\nIt worked and he still received EVPs.\n\nI just wanted to try it with the RSH knowing that it would eliminate \nthe RF that makes the RSH work. Since we don&#39;t know for sure what is \nthe best way, all ways are interesting and fun to try.\nSince the RSH is still sweeping each frequency, you never know what \nmight be transmitted in that range, even though it&#39;s not receiving my \nlocal stations... maybe something else is on a particular frequency.\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Bagheera BL &lt;bagheerabl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Why didn&#39;t I thought of that before?  Thank you very much Mike, \nthat was very interesting.  Microwaves might also be a nice echo box \nfor voices.  Though, I think the addition of a sine wave might be \nneeded for optimum results, that and the cooperation of the spirit \nworld to talk into a microwave.  As for the AM reception, maybe a \nmore direct grounding could help prevent it, so could unpowering the \noven entirely.  How about doing the same test, outside, on a lawn, \nwith the power plug buried?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This is fun!\n&gt; Thanks again Mike,\n&gt; Vincent\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; P.S.: when do you start the show &quot;Cooking with EVPs&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt;"}
