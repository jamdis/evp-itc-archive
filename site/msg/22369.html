=C2=A0 
I did a lot of experimentation with a digita=
l still camera (Nikon D70s) trying to fathom what might cause the "orbs" so=
 many people come up with. I got "orbs" in over half of the still photos I =
took in random places. Most of them were places like farmer's fields, shopp=
ing malls, country roads, etc. Some were in places that are supposedly haun=
ted. These places were not free of dust, insects, etc. Some were in dry wea=
ther and some were taken when it was drizzling or raining. I had to conclud=
e that I could not verify that any of them were paranormal in nature. Some =
of them may have been, but based on what I found out, I could not say for s=
ure. I did not see any percentage change in the number or type of "orbs" th=
at showed up in random places and those that showed up in haunted places. M=
ost of the "orbs" showed up in flash photos. I also got lens flare in a lot=
 of daytime photos.

I think the best way to capture "orbs" is with video. =
I have also spent some time looking for things that may have been orbs on v=
ideo. Usually I have to say they were also dust blowing around, bits of lea=
ves, insects, etc. Rain or drizzle is pretty obvious. A single bright spot =
moving across the screen at night could be dust or an insect. Large amounts=
 of spots moving in unison in a certain direction are for sure dust particl=
es. I've seen these move so fast that they were there in one fraction of a =
second and gone the next.

I have seen a few things on video that I couldn'=
t be certain of as regular explainable phenomena, though. In one case I saw=
 a spot moving along, then suddenly split into two spots which went off in =
two different directions. That was definitely not dust or moisture. It coul=
d have been two insects flying together which then separated. That's the on=
ly possibility I could think of other than something paranormal. That one w=
as videotaped in a basement that has a reputation of being haunted. I didn'=
t see any insects at all in the basement while I was there.

There is one p=
henomenon I have not been able to explain. I have seen it twice, both in pl=
aces that were supposedly haunted (they were not in the same place, though)=
, both taken in total pitch black darkness at night. They were both taken w=
ith digital cameras. And in both cases I was standing right next to the per=
son who took the photo and saw it on his camera's screen right after. They =
were both orange squiggly lines that zigzagged all over the photo frame. I =
have never been able to reproduce this phenomenon with my camera.
