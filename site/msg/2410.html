<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, good point you&#x27;re making that Persinger&#x27;s research is confined
to the how the brain reacts when there is substantial evidence to
support that notion that thought itself may occur outside of the brain
in a yet undefined space.

 Some believe the brain is a tuner to access memory and intuition that
exist outside of the body. Of course it also acts as the switchboard
for the body&#x27;s central nervous system but it is the non-local thought
concept that I find intriguing. Perhaps the &quot;tuner&quot; in a psychics
brain is not restricted to just their own memories but can access the
memories and feelings of the people the psychic targets.

&gt; &quot;What We Have Found
&gt; We have found moderately strong correlations between the amount of
daily global geomagnetic activity and the occurrence of epileptic
seizures, aggression, immunological responses, and ambulatory
behaviour. Even the propensity to report experiences about death and
crisis of others is associated with quiet periods of geomagnetic
activity. Certain increments of activity, which are likely to reflect
different &quot;complex patterns&quot;, have been implicated in the occurrence
of Sudden Infant Death and electrical cardiac anomalies resulting in
death in subpopulations of adults. A correlation between two variables
does not necessarily mean causation. Consequently we have imitated
specific geomagnetic patterns by the special application of a computer
technology. When we simulated these natural conditions in the
laboratory by applying experimentally generated magnetic fields within
the 50 nT range seizures in epileptic rats were elicited with the same
incidence and latency as those associated with increases in natural
geomagnetic activity.
&gt;  
&gt;                                                    AND
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; What we have learned
&gt; We have found consciousness can be described as an emergent property
of the complex electromagnetic process generated from predictable
biochemical and biological processes. Although the terms soul and mind
may have been useful at one time to describe this process, they are no
longer required. They are more like the term &quot;phlogiston&quot; that was
employed to describe why things burned before modern chemistry
emerged. When there is no electrical current moving through the parts
of a television, there is no picture. When the specific
electromagnetic patterns are not generated within the brain structures
there is no consciousness or awareness. 
&gt; Some individuals with very different brain structures show different
electromagnetic correlates that are associated with their ability to
discern stimuli others cannot detect. Counter clockwise rotation of
weak magnetic fields around the skull at specific rates of change
(derivatives) can affect subjective time and allow the average person
to experience many of the altered states reported by practitioners of
mystical traditions as well as &quot;paranormal&quot; phenomena. The critical
variables, like any chemical reaction, are the complexity and
specificity of the temporal parameters. One component of consciousness
may be &quot;sequestered&quot; within second or third derivatives of very narrow
bands of changes in frequency within the theta range. Our calculations
of resonance, based upon the power changes within quantitative
electroencephalographic measures, suggest that one electromagnetic
source of consciousness may actually exist within the 10 cm region
outside of and surrounding the cranium.&quot;
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  It seems to me this guy attemptes to explain everything in terms of
brain alone, interesting, but to easy for the skeptic to grab this as
an explanation for everything.  So where are these magnetic fields
when one meditates unassisted, or has an out of body
expereience-unassisteted.  I mean without using meditation gogles, or
sounds. What about when you see objects behind you, out of your field
of vision, what about seeing through solid objects in a normal waking
state conciosuness? Persinger&#x27;s articles seem interesting, but I think
it&#x27;s just another attempt to fit every expereience into a neat little
box.  I just wanted say I don&#x27;t think the magnietic influance explains
everything, but it&#x27;s still interesting in that the part about global
geomagnetic influance caught my attention. Like what if that affects
the boxes as well? There seems to be areas in my basement where the
box doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ll have to make sure I have all the bugs, and
malfunctions fixed, then do some more testing. Wonder how it works in
fault(quake) zones?
&gt;  
&gt; I guess the magnetic fields could be weak, and in continuous flux
all over the planet. Mostly this is thinking with my fingers (thinking
out load).

&gt; 
&gt; Here are links to research referred to in my original post.
Also,check the book I mentioned for the alternative suggestion that
emffield exposure can induce actual psychic experiences as opposed to
aperceived experience, not an actual one.Both links are to researchers
that have worked together in the
past.-Billhttp://web.ionsys.com/~remedy/Persinger,%20Michael.htmhttp://www.shaktitechnology.com/---

reference to these studies I would be veryinterested in reading them?
I have always heard and read articlessuggesting that low compression
(ELF/VLF) waves in the 5Hz to 40Hzrange caused physiological responses
and not the magnetic fields.These frequencies resonate and produce
secondary harmonics that cancause changes in behavior as well. Such as
aggression, euphoria,jumpiness, depression and so on. &gt; &gt; There is an
altered state of consciousness that will give a personthe feeling of
invisible presences and a heightened sense of paranoia,its called the
Hypnogogic state and it is usually associated withsleep paralysis or
the &quot;old hag syndrome&quot;. It can be reached from apoint of total
relaxation or a type of trance state.&gt; &gt; Please let me know if you can
find those articles, I really aminterested in reading them.&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We&#x27;ve been using the K II for about a year
and a halfand they&#x27;re ok as a low cost emf &gt; &gt; detector. Moving any
emf meter too fast will likely result in falsepositives but a slow pan
&gt; &gt; across a wall to look for electrical ground leaks will
increasereliabilty. We look for emf &gt; &gt; fields in excess of 7
milligause, the K II can detect of to 20milligause. Studies suggest
and &gt; &gt; controlled experiments verify that consistant exposure in
excess of7 milligause can result &gt; &gt; in the precieved feeling of being

be a spirit in the room. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But that&#x27;s not to say the location
can&#x27;t be haunted as well. It&#x27;sjust that if a particular room &gt; &gt; has a
lot of reported paranormal activity and there is a high emffield then
you may want &gt; &gt; to consider that fact in your evaluation of the
location.Interesting, there is alternate &gt; &gt; research that suggest
that exposure to substantial emf fields andthe resulting increase in &gt;
&gt; nerve ends firing in the brain that genuine psychic abilities
arepossible. This was referred &gt; &gt; to in the book Spook by Mary
Roach.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any device can be repurposed as a communication tool
including the KII. While some &gt; &gt; users believe that the involutary
muscle twitches that occur whileholding down the switch &gt; &gt; is sort of
like what happens when holding a pendulum, others preferto have a
selectable &gt; &gt; on / off switch on their K II. The manufacturer has
started offeringthat option according &gt; &gt; to some of the local groups
that have been selling the modifiedversions on eBay.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Bill&gt; &gt; &gt;

with great success as well as withgreat dismay. I have had &gt; &gt; the
meter &quot;pennied down&quot; sitting on a table top, and have a toy inanother
room respond &gt; &gt; to me without any activity on the meter. I feel it is
the spirit&#x27;schoice and in which manner &gt; &gt; it feels more comfortable
in communicating with you. I have hadlights turn off and back &gt; &gt; on
again in succession in response to questions and no activity onthe
meter, and then I &gt; &gt; have had no other responses except the meter, so
once again it isentirely up to the entity &gt; &gt; and how it wishes to
respond. In regards to the new apartmentbuilding, check the history &gt;
&gt; of the land that it sits on. In a few of my occasions it has beenthe
energy tied to the land &gt; &gt; or former land owners that has caused the
activity. I have done aninvestigation in a &quot;new &gt; &gt; construction&quot; home
site that the family had not moved into yet andthe activity was on the
&gt; &gt; increase, the new owners bought this piece of property as a
woodedlot with&gt; &gt; &gt; no prior establishment being on site, to anyones
knowledge thatis. To all of our &gt; &gt; surprise, land records had nothing
available for that property otherthan the location and &gt; &gt; the
pertinent info, however further research and many phone callslater it
was discovered &gt; &gt; that the property sat on the edge of a local Indian
tribalsettlement from the 1700&#x27;s &gt; &gt; (thanks to the Dept. of the
Interior and the Bureau of NativeAmerican (Indian) Affairs. It &gt; &gt;
just goes to show you that persistence and continued research paysoff
in the long run &gt; &gt; ( this one took about 4 months to research). So
Travis just keepchecking and get all you &gt; &gt; can on the property from
as far back as you can, you never know whatyou might fond out.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
