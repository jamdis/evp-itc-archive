Oftne they appear only as th eeye sockets from the skulls. \nIt&#39;s almost as easy to catch these in pix as it is to get UFOs. Right \nafter this&nbsp;I heard about another fatality int a tornado. Thre \nsky has been full of these clouds this year. \n&gt; &nbsp;\n&gt; &nbsp;There is also frequently symbols, some almost look like \nMayan, but I don&#39;t understand them. I think the whole universe tries \nto communicate in whatever is available. \n&gt; &nbsp;\n&gt; &nbsp;Frank-S\n&gt; &nbsp;\n&gt; &nbsp;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Instantly invite friends from Facebook and other social networks to \njoin you on Windows Live Messenger.
