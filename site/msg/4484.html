<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Great news, Frank!  You are once again expanding the circle.  Funny, 
I too was playing around with LEDs this morning, using them to vary 
the voltages.  I put a couple of photoresistors in the circuit to 
enjoy the changes in voltage with shadows and light.

&gt;  I have 49, and 31 meter shortwave bands, plus AM. The shortwave 
tuning might be tricky cuz the band width is less than half the size 
of the AM band, about 500 khz, so instead of tuning over a megahertz 
with 8 volts, you&#x27;re tuning about half that with the same tuning 
voltage. So far I only have the local oscillators working, still need 
the input RF amp for each band. The two cans close to the chip are IF 
transformers, the three on the bottom edge o fthe board is the local 
oscillator tank circuits.  On the highest band I&#x27;m using a red LED 
for a varactor, it has almost the perfect capacitance value. 31m on 
my Sony is 9400 khz to 9800 khz, and 49m is 5900 to 6200khz.  Still, 
how well it works, if at all, is yet to be seen.

meters  92509995 kHz  Good year-round night band; seasonal during 
the day, with best reception in winter. Time stations are clustered 
around 10 MHz.  (Time station =WWV at 10.00000000MHZ)  49 meters  
59006300 kHz  Good year-round night band; daytime reception is 
lacking
