There are those in the physical and\nnon-physical planes that do not have the best intentions. It is\nunfortunate and sometimes I am idealistic and wish the world would be\na place where everyone can work, live, and research together. But\nthat&#39;s not the way it always is.\n\nI was brought up in a wonderful home where the possibility of the\nexistence of supernatural beings was accepted by my parents. Now,\ndecades later, in our home we also accept this possibility and our\nkids, even though grown, are making up their own minds. The research I\ndo is not taken lightly but we attract those that have similar values\nto our own. Even in the spirit world. This technology that Frank has\nbrought forth is another form of ITC, and anyone with a video camera\nand tv can engage in video ITC. I don&#39;t think it would be possible to\nregulate who can have a camera and tv, just as we can&#39;t regulate who\nhas access to any other technology including radios.\n\nIt&#39;s more of a matter of personal responsibility instead of the means\nwe use to communicate. \n-Bill \n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday\n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; babiarz3,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I believe the posts you are referring to about family hour with the box\n&gt; where written in a light manner in jest. I do not presume to speak\nfor anyone \n&gt; else on this group I&#39;m sure they can speak for themselves.\n&gt;  \n&gt; you speak of responsibility with any form of open communication, I\nbelieve the individuals that are\n&gt; studying and distributing the mini box are sufficiently experienced\nand know who they should sell to and who not.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I don&#39;t believe they mean to put the mini box on the shelves in toys\nr us. Anyone that uses a box whether it be a Frank&#39;s box\n&gt; A Joe&#39;s box or a mini box will probably have done some research into\nthis method of evp and will probably have some intimate experience\n&gt; with the paranormal field and if not I&#39;m sure they will seek advice\nfrom those of us that have that experience. There is never a lack of\nadvice here.\n&gt;  \n&gt; as far as dark heads go I know through personal experience that they\ncan be deceiving and manipulative with someone that does not know any\nbetter\n&gt; I have a Frank&#39;s box and a Joe&#39;s box and do serious research on a\ndaily basis. My opinion is the good spirits out weigh the negative\nones and anyone\n&gt; that experiments with a box will tell you that you do forge strong\nbonds with what I call my spirit guides or technicians, the same two\nspirits communicate \n&gt; with me during every session and protect me from negativity. As long\nas I do not feed the darkies with my own negativity I am fine.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Also I believe that the people who are distributing the mini box\nhave set that price to deter any average person that&#39;s completely\nignorant of the paranormal\n&gt; away from purchasing this device.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have never met bill personally but know of him, he is a well\nrespected researcher and is well aware I think of the pitfalls as well\nas the rewards of box communication.\n&gt; and I don&#39;t believe he would ever endanger himself, his family or\nanyone else by carelessly using the box for entertainment purposes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; that Is my opinion for what it&#39;s worth.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce Halliday Paranormal Investigating Team \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: babiarz3@...: Fri, 23 Nov 2007 19:58:45\n+0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Family hour around the radio\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I am a fairly quiet person, most of the time. I have my thoughts\nandopinions on topics but feel strongly about &quot;to each his own&quot;.\nUnlesssomething strikes me as completely wrong, I won&#39;t debate. No one\nherehas heard from me other than recently with this mini-box yet, I\namhere several times weekly reading and offering my energy in support\nofthe research.However...something is striking me here and again, I\ncan&#39;t keep mymouth shut. The discussion about the family hour with the\nbox has ledthe way for people to mention negativity and even &quot;the dark\nguys&quot; canbe fun if not taken seriously.I ask you to consider the fact\nthat many who purchase the mini-boxwill not be of the right frame of\nmind. Most will not be in harmony.Many will take &quot;the dark guys&quot;\nseriously. Yet, you feel it&#39;s a goodidea to let anyone who wants a box\nhave one? All in the name ofsharing technology.I know that my previous\nposts expressing my concern over the massmarketing of the box, was\nbarely given consideration. Realize that Iam not being selfish- I do\nnot own a box. EVP is my passion and hasbeen from day one 6 years ago\nwhen I jumped fully into the field. I amsuccessful in capturing EVP,\nalways have been. I still do it the &quot;oldfashioned way&quot; with open air\ntechniques. Would I love to be able tohold real time 2 way\ncommunications with the other side? Of course.However, I do not think\nenough research into the possibilities hasbeen done to warrant the\napproval let alone production of these boxes. Those of us who have\nbeen on countless investigations with many peoplewill quickly admit\nthat there are some people we&#39;d rather notinvestigate with. When they\nare present, negative things tend tohappen. We all know one or two\npeople who we can say &quot;felt dark&quot; fromthe first meeting. We all admit\nthat being mentally sound is animportant quality in this field. If you\nhave mental issues, this maynot be the area of research for you. We\ndon&#39;t bring children oninvestigations for obvious reasons. BUT! If you\nwant a box that couldpossibly open up a portal and bridge the gap\nbetween here and thedark, sure! Anyone who wants one should have it!\nYou might feel that I am over reacting or being overly dramatic.That&#39;s\nfine. My concern is not what you think of me but that youconsider the\npossibilities here. Many of which we do not know. Can yoube 100% sure\nthat this is a good idea or that it&#39;s worthy of saying&quot;well, we&#39;ll see\nwhat happens&quot;? --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce\nhalliday&lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Bill,&gt; &gt; You have the\nright idea, I recently have dealt with a lot&gt; of negativity from my\nFrank&#39;s box. Harmony is very important&gt; as is the right frame of mind\nbefore turning the box on.&gt; &gt; hope you & the family had a good\nholiday.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday Paranormal Investigating Team &gt; &gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@: vilhellm@: Fri, 23 Nov 2007 02:46:20+0000Subject:\n[EVP-ITC] Family hour around the radio&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe we&#39;re just a\nlittle unconventional in our household, but mostof us here are pretty\nopen to the idea of the multiverse.
