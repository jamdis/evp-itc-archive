 I'm pretty hesitant to show this stuff, it just creates demands. 
 
 The =
top board is linear sweep with the audio amplifiers. The bottom board is th=
e RVG, and can be left off if desired. A bare copper board between the two =
acts like a shield to keep white noise out of the audio. It's designed to b=
e used with most kinds of voltage tunable radios, and this set is used with=
 the Arm Band radio from RS.  I still can't mass produce these, it took all=
 week to put this together, and I can hand wire a board almost as fast. The=
n there's the problem of suitable tuners, and other parts. 
 
 There's some=
 surface mount components, adding to the assembly complexity, and difficult=
y. 
 
 The boards are from ExpressPCB using their mini board service, three=
 boards=3D$60, there's no solder mask, or silkscreen, but the components ar=
e labeled on the layout. The board size is also limited, 2-1/2 X 3-11/16(3.=
8 in.). 
 
 I hate to stir up a hornets nest by presenting new stuff, but I=
'm kinda proud of this. I'll share the layouts with those capable of assemb=
ling the boards themselves. They would still have to come up with tuners, c=
ontrols, switches, and an enclosure, besides paying for the boards to be et=
ched. Most of the shielded wire I use is scavenged out of computer monitor =
VGA cables, old VCRs, and tape decks. You need three conductor shielded for=
 the tone control, and two conductor shielded wire for the volume controls.=
 I do use shielded wire for the speaker outputs, mic input, and line output=
s. Not all old VCRs have the shielded wire, and I haven't found anywhere to=
 buy what is needed. 
 
 I'm calling this one 40 cuz it was assembled, and =
made operational after #39.
