<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have usually received good results without any warmup period. I think 
that this is more the byproduct of being lucky and not the norm as many 
people report that a good warmup period is required. Although I have 
been lucky, I know that people often report that the boxes don&#x27;t 
necessrily hit the ground running.
