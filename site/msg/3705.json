This has gotten to the point where i can&#39;t even do a session anymore bec=\r\nause i&#39;m so blocked by negative thoughts from this group it&#39;s pointless to =\r\nconcentrate on the box and get results. Honestly who cares what chris does =\r\nanyway, does it really affect everyone&#39;s lives that much. I have a job and =\r\nthis is a hobby that i used to really like, but now this board has brought =\r\nme down. It seems all people want to do is make this like a street fight wi=\r\nth challenges and negative views and for what reason? If anyone is concerne=\r\nd about hearing Chris&#39;s audio, i have about 2 hours of box sessions from Ea=\r\nstern State on my web site for all to listen to. It&#39;s www.keyportparanormal=\r\n.com and go to investigation and click on eastern state. All the audio is a=\r\nt the bottom of that page and you guys can judge for yourself and i heard a=\r\n lot come out of that box that night personally because i repeated a lot of=\r\n stuff back to chris that i heard. Enough already, let&#39;s move on to the nex=\r\nt great thing. That radio shack hack was a great breakthrough here, let&#39;s j=\r\nust be happy we got that before it was shut down. Now we have another avenu=\r\ne to go down, but we can&#39;t do it with all these negatives out there.
