I have my add on sweep board ready, \nbut I wonder just how important is the human touch on the radio. I was \nthinking about adding a plate connected to the circuit ground that I just \ntouch while recording.\n\nI haven&#39;t heard much about those &quot;stations&quot; in other cities, and countries \nfor a few years. I still get them once in a while. I think I spend way too \nmuch time putting boards together, and don&#39;t get time to play. This voice \neven sounds like a British accent.\n\n\n\nFrank\n\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Sweep Tuning of AM Radio Band -\n&gt;Date: Thu, 29 Mar 2007 17:59:38 -0700\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks for the feedback Frank you have a good ear for these messages. Tried \n&gt;something different tonight. I have a small tesla coil in the basement that \n&gt;I can run powered mainly by audio (music). This creates broadband noise on \n&gt;both AM and FM bands on my upstairs tuner. his is a capture doing a sweep \n&gt;tuning of the FM band while the Tesla coil was running.\n&gt;&quot;We heard along from Tesla that one human&#39;s going to be testing&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;The chatter indicates the message is coming from a control point in London!\n&gt;\n&gt;Dave\n&gt;\n&gt;--- franks-boxes@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;From: &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Sweep Tuning of AM Radio Band -\n&gt;Date: Thu, 29 Mar 2007 13:09:59 -0600\n&gt;\n&gt;I don&#39;t know, could be, to me it sounds like &quot;Our Chris-he is giving our\n&gt;reception&quot;, like maybe they are trying to say Chris is getting these guys.\n&gt;Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Sweep Tuning of AM Radio Band -\n&gt; &gt;Date: Wed, 28 Mar 2007 17:50:15 -0700\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Frank, I got this tonight and it sounds like the same voice swept through\n&gt; &gt;several station channels. Could they be talking about the Christopher who\n&gt; &gt;uses one of your boxes?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Our Chris.....Is giving a reception&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Dave\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; WOW!! I am amazed that someonme actually tried this! It does work.\n&gt; &gt;There was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a Danish(I think) researcher doing the same thing, but never could\n&gt; &gt;make\n&gt; &gt; &gt; contact with them. I have done this myself, and it can work wiht TV\n&gt; &gt;too, if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you can switch channels fast ennough. I think you could use a\n&gt; &gt;steeper motor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; controler to randomly turn a stepper moter, to turn the dial.\n&gt; &gt;Manually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spinning the dial has one advantage, the sound is clearer! I have\n&gt; &gt;yet to see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a method of ITC that produces better results that the random tuning\n&gt; &gt;methods.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;To: &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Sweep Tuning of AM Radio Band\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Date: Mon, 19 Mar 2007 17:19:47 -0700\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I have a very sensitive old AM tuner with a flywheel tuning\n&gt; &gt;system. I tried\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;several recording sessions manually sweeping the tuner through the\n&gt; &gt;AM band\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;late at night. I got pretty good at keeping the dial moving at a\n&gt; &gt;constant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;rate of speed. This is not nearly as good as Frank&#39;s &#39;hands off&#39;\n&gt; &gt;random\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;tuning method but it still produced some results. What impressed\n&gt; &gt;me most is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that some of the voices sound the same, even though I tuned\n&gt; &gt;through several\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;channels. This attached capture could be a technical message.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Plug a million hertz&quot;   One Million Hertz = 1mhz = 1000khz, which\n&gt; &gt;is close\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the center frequency for the AM broadcast band.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Dave\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; 031907plugamillionhertz.mp3 &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i&#39;m making a difference.��Make every IM count for the cause of \n&gt;your\n&gt; &gt;choice.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Join Now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://clk.atdmt.com/MSN/go/msnnkwme0080000001msn/direct/01/?\n&gt; &gt;href=http://im.live.com/messenger/im/home/?source=hmtagline\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; 032807ourchrisisgivingareception.mp3 &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;It�s tax season, make sure to follow these few simple tips\n&gt;http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Taxes/PreparationTips/PreparationTips.aspx?icid=HMMartagline\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
