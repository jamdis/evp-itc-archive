&gt; I checked to see what it would cost to sell one of ebay. To list 
it 
&gt; it is $1.00 for $25.00-449.00 plus 8.75% of the initial $25.00 
&gt; ($2.19), plus 3.50% of the remaining closing value balance ($25.01 
&gt; to $1,000.00)
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; I would be willing to list the one I have plus give the 
information 
&gt; on the free hacking and that fact that you can get one at Radio 
&gt; Shack for $24.99 just to shut this guy down. At the most I would 
be 
&gt; out $1.00 to not sell it!!!! Well worth it I&#x27;d say.
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone send me the written instructions on how to hack the 12-
&gt; 249.

&gt; &gt; Either that, or anyone willing to make them for $25 + shipping 
&gt; with 
&gt; &gt; no profit?  You could then list them just like the ones that are 
&gt; &gt; selling...so they pull up identical to the listings that are up 
&gt; &gt; there.  :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; I was thinking if someone would list a FREE DOWNLOAD of 
&gt; &gt; instructions for the various hacks 
&gt; &gt; &gt; on the Radio Shack units, it could put an end to the business 
&gt; for 
&gt; &gt; sellers that are taking 
&gt; &gt; &gt; advantage of people who are unaware that they could probably 
&gt; hack 
&gt; &gt; the units for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen &quot;downloads&quot; of various things listed before.  Why 
&gt; not 
&gt; &gt; this?
