<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Actually I dont think this guy is crazy at all.

This is an amazing story and believable at best.

First, there are many our there both men and women who have suspected 
their lovers/wives were cheating on them, and did just what this guy 
did. 

What happened to this guy is believable as first he got caught up in 
the technology in that he could spy and not be seen, and second he was 
being spied on himself but what sounds like deceased spirits who took 
advantage of the situation and scared the bajesus out of him.

Black Bear, look at this from a different perspective. This guy did 
not go looking to make contact with the spirit world like what we do, 
the spirit world contacted him and he did not know what it was nor how 
to handle it.

I could be wrong, but to me he came to this group for guidance on what 
he is dealing with and what should he do.

This is a story right off the press of a Steven King novel. 

My comment would be that some mischievious spirits took advantage of 
you, and you have nothing to worry about.  But now you have come in 
contact with a world you knew existed but one that you never knew you 
could make contact with.

If you have any deceased relatives, and you wish to contact them, do 
so, and say a prayer before you turn your device on asking your 
guardian angel to keep only positive spirits around you while you 
record.

Thanks for sharing your story, and again do not worry. 

Mike

&gt; It sounds like you seriously need some professional help. Anyone 
who  
&gt; would not only stay with someone like you describe, but go to the  
&gt; length you have with spying has some serious issues that no one on  
&gt; this list can advise you with. My suggestion, and I&#x27;m extremely  
&gt; serious, is that you get some professional psychological help and 
quick.
