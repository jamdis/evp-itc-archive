OK, so right now, I have the radio set up with the external speaker, so you are saying????  so I can hear them, that I should set my head phones to my recorder when it is recording, and that way I can hear the spirit responses more clear???
   
  Genius if that is what you said?????
   
  Please advise, and thanks in advance

You can record by connecting the recorder to the headphone jack, announce you're doing an EVP recording, and just record without hearing a thing, and they'll still talk. Spirit is not limited as most paranormal experts would like to believe, we are the ones with all the limitations.
