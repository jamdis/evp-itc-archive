<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>After a Catholic priest conducted a mass at our home (which is
haunted, apparently), we ran the TV throughout the day and night tuned
to EWTN, which broadcasts masses throughout the day, and it seemed to
help. During one of the priest&#x27;s visits my wife and I experienced a
pronounced clearing of the air in the home, which resulted in a
&quot;lifting&quot; of the atmosphere. I believe these things help.
