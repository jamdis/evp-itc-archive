that's a good idea with the fast sweep..but not fair to ignore people files=
 just because the sweep is slowers...it's like saying do it my way or it's =
not right... don't do=C2=A0 super fast sweep however I set it so you only h=
ear tibits of a station..so no full words

I always keep the sweep at a very fast pace, mos=

If you hear a voice that's crystal clear, it'=

I would suggest a test for anybody on this forum. Set you ghost box a=

I feel tha=

 the most part.
