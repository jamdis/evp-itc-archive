<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I appreciate all your help Ursula. Although I&#x27;d love to have the 3, the package would probably be better for me.

I&#x27;ve bought things from China in the past, and although it&#x27;s a long wait, the stuff is usually good. But once I got a portable cd writer, and they sent me the case only. When I told them they advertised it in the title as a writer, they said that was just keywords. So I lost money on that, and am now cautious about buying from China. I waited over 2 months for something that wasn&#x27;t even what I purchased. Grrrr....

&gt; ok so if you have a camcorder that already has tv in. that will work if not then you have to get a min dvr here is a link where you can find them..some are really not expensive down side there Hong Kong I didnt want to be bother with that cause i have no patience lol. you can find some that is in us as well here is a link

&gt;  
&gt; now if money is tight i would suggest going with a not so expensive model.. I went with the best because well my hubby said i wouldn&#x27;t be happy with less (so true especailly knowing this was out there lol) but all the models are good and for its a investment. OR you can go with a bundle
