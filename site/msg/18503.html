I never quoted you. I was ma=
king the point that when you make statements such as "I just don't believe =
everything people tell me", you are basically calling those people liars or=
 frauds or whatever you want to call it! There are hundreds of files posted=
 here that are the results members of this group have gotten during their s=
essions. If you listen to them, the results are there. The members of this =
group are giving you the evidence to listen .=C2=A0 


As an example, Frank=
 related the contents of a session . I don't recall him calling that inform=
ation a personal prediction of his, yet you said you were writing that down=
 as one of his predictions. =C2=A0Please do not insult others and then be =
=C2=A0surprised when people are offended.

Just because I do not get the results you=

Why do you believe it is?

If you belong to a group, and then es=

What have I said or done for you to attack=

Is it because I don't believe everything you do? I don't att=

So why do you feel it necessary to attack me?

sting one of those single supply dual sweep boxes, so set up a hack radio I=
 had handy. "--BehindTheSun--ComesFarFromEarth--(jack-frag)IsComin'--Sessio=
n-EarthWillThenCollide-ItEnds--Comet-Good(?)". The jack thing is Jack FM, 1=
05.5 FM a rock station. Presumable 2012. The December 21st date from the Ma=
yans seems to be a middle number, there's like a window right around C=
hristmas, as they seem to mention the 17th along with this stuff. Who knows=
 if it means anything, but what I don't like are those that profess to "kno=
w better". </div>
