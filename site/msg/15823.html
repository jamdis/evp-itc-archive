Depends on what you want to =
get out of it.

Me-I want solid proof that I am talking an intelligent enti=
ties, preferably spirits of the dead, or non human entities. I have not see=
n enough for me to be certain that is what is going on with this technology=
, however I am not ready to give up on the possibility.

The reason I am no=
t ready to give up on it is because I do believe in that possibility.

    So what constitutes proof? All I know=
 for certain is that something talks by using the bits of audio from radio =
stations as the tunign is swept. However, it can not be proven what it is t=
hat's talking, so I guess that makes the whole thing invalid of little use.=
