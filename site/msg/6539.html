Thanks LC.  I'm going to listen to your recordings tonight when I get home.=
  I'm intrigued by the box research and anxious to get started, but frustra=
ted that I'm not mechanically inclined.  I think you may be onto something =
with regard to people having individual roles to play, and you must feel so=
 inspired by the messages you've received.

  Robin,

  I uploaded some of m=
y recordings that indicate a bigger picture.

  Some of the messages say th=
ere are "many spirits here," spirit rescue 
  is "very important," etc. You=
 can go through them under LC's folder.

  Last Friday, I recorded with res=
pect to 2008, "psychic event" 
  and "universal shift." That would indicate=
 that there is a bigger 
  thing going down, in my opinion. However, I also=
 acknowledge that 
  people here may have different callings/messages/uses =
other than what 
  I am hearing. I am going to just follow where the path b=
efore me 
  leads and try to find my role in it.

  Personally, I think thi=
s needs to be in many people's hands. That's 
  an interest of mine, too. N=
ot sure yet how it will happen, but the 
  radio hacks are a nice start.
