 Now, he s=

Thanks to everyone who participated in=
 Experiment 2.

  

  On Friday, 7/16/2010 I placed an object on top of my =
computer monitor, right in front of me, and left it there until noon Denver=
 time on Monday, 7/19/2010.   This experiment asked for participants to det=
ermine what that object was. Vague or partial answers would not be counted =
(for example, just giving a color, shape, size,  what it's made of, etc): w=
e're looking for what it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time =
Monday won't count.  Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders,=
 or any other means they chose.  

  

  In order to keep me honest, I took=
 a picture of the object at the start of the experiment and loaded it to th=
e Files section (RJ folder) of this group.  The idea with this file is that=
 you could download it at the beginning of the experiment and 'keep it safe=
' on your computer. Then at the end of the experiment, I would post the pas=
sword so you can reveal the contents of the file. That way, you were in con=
trol of the original image during the entire time, not me.  

  

  Passwor=
ded pdf: http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ20100716=
. pdf

  

  The password for that file is: 2plus2isFour

  Instructions, i=
f you need them for the other files, are also in that RJ folder.

  

  So =
to the results:

  

  Number of participants: 6

  Total tries: 29

  Ambi=
guous answers: 0

  Correct answers: 0

  

  Object: Chair

  As a little side experiment, on Monday I also asked if anyone had g=
otten any answers that might indicate an article of clothing (though I did =
not say why I was asking).   One theory is that the human operator can be i=
nfluenced by things they already know or suspect, and so interpret audio wi=
th their own personal 'educated guesses', that would differ from what they =
would hear had they not known those things.  This side experiment did indic=
ate some support for that theory, since before I mentioned 'articles of clo=
thing', no one included an article of clothing in their results.  But after=
 I mentioned it, several reports of clothing began to appear.  I did not ad=
d these tries to the results above.

  

  If anyone has any observations, =
comments, or ideas for improvement, let me know. Again, thanks to everyone =
who participated in this experiment.
