"WHOLADO A$$O"\
  This is the Desciption of the Group!

  Description             This is a group for the discussion, promotion, and developemnt of Electronic Voice Phenomenon, and Instrumental Transcommunication methods and technologies as used in the communication with spirit, and other entities.

The owner of the is group has been doing work in this field since 2000, and has been working with home made systems developed for both audio, and video ITC. 

I invite anyone interested to join. I am not really scientific, I just take the approach, try different methods, see what works. I go on the results I get.

Try not to get too religious, some discussion will be tolerated as long as no one is offended. There is a "banned" button for those that get too obnoxious. I don't mind a good argument as long as it's not taken too serious, and people get pissed off, or hurt feelings. Try to be considerate of others! If I detect attempts at debunking, I'll ban immediately! It's one thing to be skeptical, it's another to ignore and deny all evidence.

First off "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?"
The post for another group was meant to partner with this group in a combined fashion not abandon it.
 
Second it is not Frank's group anymore. Frank turned the group over to other senior members here.

          Bruce, 
    My thoughts exactly.  Is there anyway we can move this group over to a better suited environment for categorizing?  I tend to think of being able to categorize these different emails in a place being much more managable in a bulletin board style forum.  Does anyone have access to one on their webhosted site that we could setup and and use?  
All the best,
Bryan

Subject: [EVP-ITC] So many Posts _Files Getting Lost In the Shuffle

    hey guy's,

I posted a number of files yesterday from my last EVP maker 
allophones session. and received not one response.

I think this is due to the overwhelming amount of posts that are 
being written and files posted to this group.

The files that are posted, not just mine but all are important to the 
research and deserve to be heard and commented on by all.

My thoughts are that this group is not just a place to post research 
results and posts pertaining to the technical and aspect and 
advancement of this research, but has become a social forum in some 
ways where small insignificant posts are tending to push other posts 
and file announcements to the back pages of the message area.

Also members personal e-mail is getting so cluttered with posts every 
day that most do not have the time, patience or strength to review 
each one and I know when I open a post be it here or in my e-mail and 
the first couple of words have nothing or little to do with research 
or are repetitious of ten other posts. I simply hit the delete 
button and the post goes unread.

I know we all everyone, put a lot of time and work into our research 
and when it falls through the cracks without even being presented for 
comment, it gets disheartening.

Maybe we should start a group for social and casual discussion 
amongst members and have this one for hard research posts.
That way one does not conflict with the other.

I know I sound like sour grapes, but I'm sure I'm not the only one to 
feel this way.

And I know the comments will come that no one has time to read all 
the posts or respond to all the files. I know all of this.

There is more to be said and more idea's on how to make the whole 
issue more amicable for everyone.

I just want to get initial reaction first.

Bruce
