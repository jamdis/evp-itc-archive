<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The lack of boxes actually spawned the hack, so everything for a 
reason. Just the parts for mine are more than $25 bucks, and the 
hack is almost as good, it does the job. 

 Maybe, if I quit going off on tangents, and just get some boards 
professionally done....

 I did have a couple boards made last fall for the LA1816, but the 
radio turned out to be just c-r-a-p-p-eee, I just set them aside. 
One all the wiring is done, and one is just the bare board. They are 
mostly SMT components. If there are some real techno-gurus out 
there, I don&#x27;t have a problem giving these boards away. The AM band 
works, but it&#x27;s kinda noisy, which could be just the wrong choice of 
IF cans, or maybe the RF amp. These are second gen boards for the 
LA1816, the first one I had the pin spacing too close for the radio 
chip. They have RVG, and linear, which also may contribute to noise. 
Randy Schnieder has one of these, that was 25,  now I can&#x27;t remember 
what I did with 26, the ones I have on hand would be 28, and as yet 
an unassigned number. Oh yeah, Randy went halfers with the cost, so 
he has 26.

&gt; I think it is all an alter ego problem, certain people think they 
are blessed to have one of your boxes.  Hell I could only wish to 
have one myself, but I know that their is not enough to go around, 
and also know that I probably will never be able to get one.  So I&#x27;m 
content to have my Radio Shack Hack, without the ego problem.  
That&#x27;s fine with me, I feel great about being a member of this 
group, and making some friends.  Maybe some day I might be able to 
use what I learn from y&#x27;all to build something for myself.

&gt;   Later Guys, and have a great day

&gt;            Hi All; We have been warned by others from time to time 
about unbridled box use, as it supposedly brings in negativity. I 
don&#x27;t want to believe that, but there are a few cases of people 
using boxes made by me, as well as the hack radios, and going whacko 
big time. Its&#x27; either all ego--I&#x27;m the onlyest one that can use 
this, or like the more recent example. I don&#x27;t know if these people 
were like this to start, or if it&#x27;s an external influance, but it&#x27;s 
discouraging. There seems to be a similar reaction with systems not 
made by me--so I&#x27;ve been told.
&gt;  
&gt;  Soooo, maybe burn some white candles, and maybe get a Rosary. My 
guys talk about the Catholics, and the Purple Princess has a 
Catholic connection on the etheric levels, although the church 
imposes too many limits on her. I wouldn&#x27;t want to go into a state 
of fear, but a little protection stuff couldn&#x27;t hurt. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Not only do I not have the time to mass produce boxes, I&#x27;m 
beginning to think it&#x27;s not a good idea anyway.
