I recently got the ovilus and brought it to a cemetery and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; field where a church burned down many years ago. I can not get too\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specific without having people thinking I am making stuff up but it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; got fairly wild towards the end of the session. For most of the time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we were there the Ovilus seemed to be spitting out a lot of random\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff but it kept mentioning the name Seth. After we moved over\nto the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; field where the church was, the ovilus got a lot more active and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; started saying relevant words like cross and priest. The Ovilus was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; MUCH more active when being used by our female member. Towards\nthe end\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Ovilus said I am Seth, and the woman that was with me told Seth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that she did not want to talk to you I&#39;ve heard bad things about\nyou.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; After that the Ovilus said rather nasty things to her and she\nstarted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feeling nauseous and she ripped the headphones off her head.\nNeedless\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to say we ended the session and got out of there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Over the course of our investigation we found that the Ovilus was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; saying many words that are not on the 500 word list, so yesterday I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; did some test recordings to see what words would come up and one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the first things that came up was: seth blamed rest I am not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gare demon (all in that order). Needless to say this has me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; concerned that whatever seth is is still with the box so I am\nnot even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; storing this thing inside of my house. I have an MP3 of the ovilus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; saying this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also from my experience about 50% of the words it is saying\naren&#39;t on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the list. Chris Fleming has been getting words not on the list, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Barry FitzGerald has stated that just over 50% of the words he is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; getting are not on the list. Is there really a much larger list than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; advertised or is this thing really magic? Highly doubtful IMO.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My most important question is is anyone else getting the name\nSeth out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the Ovilus? How many people use this device here?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; ____________________________________________________________\n&gt; Click for free information on court reporter careers, $100 per hour\npotential.\n&gt;\nhttp://thirdpartyoffers.juno.com/TGL2131/fc/Ioyw6iieWBbTYtuKzU2eLFZGShTiP5wqFONJXlsSUMOZ7BQjMxjAuY/\n&gt;"}
