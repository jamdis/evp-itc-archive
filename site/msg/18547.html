P-ITC] Scamp,

=C2=A0 
I don't think I have enough data yet to make any con=
clusions, so I plan more 
experiments.=C2=A0 Since there are different dist=
inct claims about what the box or 
the recorders can do, I try to make diff=
erent distinct experiments for each.

Some people claim they can get the bo=
x to tell them things that the operator 
couldn't know, so my "whats the ob=
ject" experiment is one way to examine that.=C2=A0 
Some people claim the b=
oxes can make predictions, so cataloging predictions and 
examining the res=
ults can help examine that.=C2=A0 If there are other claims, I will 
try to=
 figure experiments based on those.
