<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I edit my files to display the answer, i.e---if i ask what is your name 
and 14 seconds later they say &quot;clyde&quot;.  At that point i will cut out 
the 14 seconds of nothing and just leave the answer to my question.  
Sometimes i have to make the file a bit louder, but no mods to the 
actual file.  It is what it is and i leave it in raw format for all to 
hear, the less you mess with the files is better to bring people onto 
this side of the fence.

&gt; Hello All -
&gt; 
&gt; I have been studying this format of communication for better part of 
a 
&gt; year now.  I have been listening to clips and reading posts here for 
&gt; sometime and am impressed with direction of your work.  The majority 
of 
&gt; clips I&#x27;ve listened to, regardless of the type of box used, are quite 
&gt; clear.  My question to you is as follows:  are the files edited or 
&gt; changed at all or is this the quality they are coming through at?
