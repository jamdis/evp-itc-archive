Cept you still owe me the one of you \n&gt;wheeling around on one LOL\n&gt;\n&gt;   Now how did I know it would be THAT color? =) Very nice Frank you did a \n&gt;great job on it. I saw the instructions for the recumbents before and it \n&gt;made pretty good sense especially if you have no fear of welding to add on \n&gt;extra features.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Misty\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           I have to get these finished now. This is a home made recumbent. \n&gt;That&#39;s the\n&gt;trouble with knowing how to do stuff, there&#39;s no off time!
