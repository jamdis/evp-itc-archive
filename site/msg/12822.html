<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Marie. Welcome to the group. I enjoy manual sweep tuning and have had some great results including direct responses using that method. I think when they use my name (first middle and last) constantly that kind of throws out the randomness idea most skeptics have. But usually it takes people hearing thier own names and info to wonder if there is more to it.

&gt; Hi i am really interested in evp/itc and have been recording
&gt; for 
&gt; aproximately 5/6 months i currently do both normal evp work
&gt; and also 
&gt; radio scanning(not franks box or radio shack hacks) but
&gt; manually 
&gt; scanning through the channels..i have been quite surprised
&gt; by the 
&gt; results that i have got.
&gt; I have video posted on youtube(screen name mazblondie) and
&gt; it would be 
&gt; excellent if anyone could give there opinions.
&gt; I have had many different theory presented to me, from
&gt; imaginationto 
&gt; plain faking it, but i can believe that it is all down to
&gt; chance!!
&gt; Hope to hear from you soon.
&gt; Marie</pre>
