At least it is somewhat of an explanation of how the process works, of man=
ually tuning the dial to get the voices. 
 
 For those that don't know, it'=
s simply tuning a radio across the band slowly while recording. I announce =
I'm doing an EVP recording, and start recording. You don't even have to do =
the tuning smoothly, or cover the whole band. The radio I'm using here take=
s multiple turns of the dial to cover the AM band.
 
 This method results i=
n more consistent messages than what I get with the box, which is the same =
method, only automated.
