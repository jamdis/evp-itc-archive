You mean me, April??

Yes and no. It was more of a shadow person, except it=
 was 3D and just head, torso and partial arms. It hovered in front of my hu=
sband and I for a few seconds (we both saw it), then it turned and popped o=
utside the apartment door. I say popped because it made an audible "pop" an=
d the apartment shook as it went out.

I am of the opinion that it was not =
human.

 EVP in real time.

            I took part in an investigation of Ashmore =
Estates, near Ashmore IL, on Saturday night. We had six video cameras set u=
p in the three halls of the building. The video for all was being monitored=
 and recorded at a central location. Alas, we did not have microphones at t=
