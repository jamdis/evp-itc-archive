<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Misty,

In &quot;It&#x27;s dark&quot; I was making a remark about how &quot;they&quot;ight have
curiosity about the device I was using.

In &quot;the box is talking,&quot; the clip catches a few sounds of conversation
I was having with others present.  I actually like this one the best,
because it seems clear that the words ride on top of the scan not in
direct response to a question, but making use of the noise matrix to
chime in with a comment.

Intriguing!

Rosemary

&gt; &gt; Hi folks,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve posted a couple of clips for feedback, obtained with my Mini-Box
&gt; &gt; #115 June 14 at Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield.  Both occurred in
&gt; &gt; the solitary confinement area: &quot;it&#x27;s dark&quot; and &quot;the box is talking.&quot; 
&gt; &gt; The speaker was a different one than I usually use, an iSymphony
&gt; &gt; T-Speaker from Radio Shack.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks
