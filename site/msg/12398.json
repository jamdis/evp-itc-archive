Main credit\nshould of course go to Frank though, he provided the main roadwork and\ninspiration.  My main concern design wise for this was to have a\nversion that was compartmentalized (&quot;plug and play&quot; if you will) so\nthat components can be easily substituted for experimenting.  Plus\nsomething lower powered to make it more portable, hence the idea to\nuse a low power speaker powered by the input device, and a\ncorresponding hearing assistance device as the mic/amp to amp it up. \nOnce the lid is on, this thing is *loud* but clear.  In fact, I have\nthe amp set to min volume and its still a little to loud to listen to\nwith headphones sometimes unless you play around with equalizing the\nvolume settings on the 820 and the speaker.\n\nI&#39;m also going to be experimenting swapping out the 820 with an iPod\nshuffle containing a lengthy pre-recorded sound file of audio.  30\nsecond talk (maybe me reading the alphabet or something), chopped up\nwith EVP-Maker, and then spliced out to repeat for 30 minutes or so. \nI realize, as Frank stated previously, that they can effect sound\nanywhere including in a control sound like this as its being recorded\nor mixed.  But my concern is satisfying the &quot;skeptics&quot; out there who,\nas you put it when you first joined the group, feel that using the\nradio input it &quot;would be hard to distinguish from coincidence&quot;.  A\ncontrolled input that can be referred back to for comparison would\nsatisfy that qualification that keeps getting thrown up. \n\nMarty\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ourobouros2k2&quot; &lt;ourobouros2k2@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am loving this design. October hitting me pretty hard but will try\n&gt; to scare up the jack to implement this design soon. thanks for your\n&gt; hard work and posting easy-to-follow instructions.\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks again,\n&gt; Andy\n&gt; \n&gt;"}
