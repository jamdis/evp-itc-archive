I have formed an opinion that he is inclined  \nto control the message by reading his own words and hearing his own  \nwords on the radio and on tapes of his sessions, and I cannot  \nlogically interpret them in any other way. Since you don&#39;t agree, If  \nyou would like to directly quote him to prove otherwise, then I am  \nalways ready to modify my opinions. Truly. But I am not going to  \nchange my mind without evidence.\n\nI don&#39;t pull my opinions out of a void. I have seen what are, at this  \npoint, *generations* of paranormal researchers try to control the  \nmessage and the process by saying that only the Special get to be  \npart of the circle or the gang or the team or the bridge, or  \nwhatever. I have seen every single one of these units explode or  \nimplode or turn into a nascent religion over the control issues of a  \ndominant person. I do not like this messianic behavior because it has  \nruined what was otherwise a potentially profitable avenue of  \nresearch. Because I don&#39;t talk about my own history or abilities  \noften, and because I don&#39;t yet have a box, that does not mean that I  \nam not a hoary old raven with a hell of a lot of perspective on this.  \nI&#39;ve watched it happen again and again and again--thank goodness,  \nmostly from a distance.\n\n/HMO\n\nAnn\n\n\n\n\nOn Nov 30, 2007, at 6:30 AM, babiarz3 wrote:\n\n&gt; What you hear and the actual words being used are two different\n&gt; things.

In fact he has yet to pay anything for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes he has,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or any of the other equipment he &quot;barrowed&quot;, such as the Sony\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pocket size\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cassette recorder, and Tarot CD, he still has. Moon is the one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that claims\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only he, or a designated trainee can properly interpret the  \n&gt; output\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box, despite the fact that I have stated numerous times that I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; made the box\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for anyone to use, and one&#39;s results are any no better or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; supercede in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyway the results of anyone else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now when someone claims that these new system don&#39;t work,  \n&gt; or only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evil spirits, and even open portals so demons, or what not can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enter, they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are lying, and attempting to keep the use of any equipment,  \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; methods of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirit communication for themselves. The motive being  \n&gt; priofit,a s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; far as I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can tell. The portal thing is Hollywood!
