&gt;  Been gettng something aobut May 17th, now &quot;they&quot; say it starts May
&gt; 15th--I&#x27;m like WTF is this? There seems to be othere that have  pridistion
&gt; as well, but it&#x27;s almost as reliable as this stuff. This is from EVPmkaer
&gt; tonight, using the origianl raw files I used ten years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Thanks for writing Frank!  However, it was not me who made the
&gt; prediction....I was talking about a Christian scholar who has done some
&gt; research and through his recalculation has determined that the predicted
&gt; 2012 shift will be occurring around May 17th 2011...he also says this is the
&gt; date when Jesus will be returning to Earth.  Very interesting, we&#x27;ll
&gt; see......&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Soooo, whatever.
