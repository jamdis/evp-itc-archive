&gt; &gt;  I used to get alot of that stuff, I usually listen form tape, and when
&gt; &gt; they were really obnoxious I would just back the tape up and record over the
&gt; &gt; bad voice. I don&#x27;t how it works, but it stops them cold. They don&#x27;t come
&gt; &gt; back and keep harassing. I tolerate some cussing an name calling, I can out
&gt; &gt; cuss any of them!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  They probably find other ways to pull tricks, which is why I don&#x27;t any
&gt; &gt; information as gospel from the boxes, and I laugh at the experts that think
&gt; &gt; they have it all figured out.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  There&#x27;s a thing from India--I think--the spirits throw pebbles at people
&gt; &gt; walking along  the paths at night to put a little fear in the people. With
&gt; &gt; boxes, they also throw pebbles--and &quot;they&quot; tell me they throw pebbles. It&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; like a game or something.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks guys for the advice, I was a little bit distressed at first upon
&gt; &gt;&gt; hearing those things, but I feel a little bit better now... and armed with
&gt; &gt;&gt; advice on how to handle it next time... I also found someone say the f-word
&gt; &gt;&gt; now too, but I&#x27;ll know how to handle it better now. Should I post the vulgar
&gt; &gt;&gt; files up on here, as proof, or should I leave them off this group, for being
&gt; &gt;&gt; vulgar? Frank? Anyone? Please let me know.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I know that there are many spirits who are vulgar, malicious, liars,
&gt; &gt;&gt; troublemakers, etc. Last night I did my first ghost box session alone, (my
&gt; &gt;&gt; second session overall - or third if I count the synth voice box session).
&gt; &gt;&gt; During the session, I was feeling a little bit self-conscious and
&gt; &gt;&gt; discouraged, not sure if it would work for me alone, etc. so my mood was a
&gt; &gt;&gt; little down, maybe negative.... also I&#x27;m a relatively young female (28). I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt;&gt; wondering if its due to those two factors that I received - upon going back
&gt; &gt;&gt; to listen to the recorded session (I&#x27;ll try to post files up later for
&gt; &gt;&gt; confirmation)... a series of unwelcoming and vulgar messages... toward the
&gt; &gt;&gt; beginning of the session someone said &quot;you&#x27;re too young&quot; and then a while
&gt; &gt;&gt; into it I got &quot;h* cheats, hit me hit me hit me hit me&quot;... and then toward
&gt; &gt;&gt; the end of the session I got &quot;a**hole&quot;. (Frank, please let me know if I&#x27;ve
&gt; &gt;&gt; crossed the line as far as posting up vulgar words on this group - not sure
&gt; &gt;&gt; how else to discuss my session, lol... and I do apologize)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So here&#x27;s the thing, I can alter my attitude, to be more positive, but I
&gt; &gt;&gt; can&#x27;t alter my age and gender... so any other females get vulgar messages
&gt; &gt;&gt; like this? And what can I do about it? What should I say? I really have no
&gt; &gt;&gt; desire to continue with these sessions if this is how I get treated... I
&gt; &gt;&gt; guess I was an easy target, just starting out with the ghost box, and not
&gt; &gt;&gt; being a confident type, I&#x27;m a shy, timid, walk-all-over-me type too
&gt; &gt;&gt; often.... how do I &quot;administer discipline&quot; in this situation? Does it work
&gt; &gt;&gt; to just tell them to please stop it, or that you&#x27;re not welcome if you don&#x27;t
&gt; &gt;&gt; behave, etc? Or does that only egg them on further? Help!
