<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I went into my file and checked out the clip and it shows its there 
and it dose play. the one thing i realized is it dose not show a time 
stamp so as far as the time i wrote down i dont know if you can see 
what i am talking about. is it possible that the file would show for 
me and noone else? I am new at this and its the first time i have 
uploaded a file. i will try and figure it out and maybe post it a 
second time. there are 2 accounts under norther il ghost hunting 
team. the other one was my husbands he was trying out.(N.I.G.H.T) and 
he still dose use sometimes. it is empty. the one with the file is 
northern il ghost hunting team. well now im rambling on and on again. 
anyway if its still not there please let me know and i will try it 
again.

&gt; &gt; weve been doing some work with the radio shack box and this one 
in 
&gt; &gt; particular is important. my husbands father died when he was 
young 
&gt; and  
&gt; &gt; his uncle was murdered a few years ago. in many box sessions he 
has 
&gt; &gt; heard the two of them saying certain key things. in this session 
he 
&gt; &gt; asks for comfirmation that it is him. and askes how he died. at 
0:22 
&gt; &gt; and 0:30 you hear something. i was wondering if anyone else heard 
the 
&gt; &gt; same thing. like i said in a previous post him and i sometimes 
hear 
&gt; &gt; different words.like at 0:22. it may be a gender thing or not but 
at 
&gt; &gt; 0:30 we deffinately hear the same thing. i have put the file in 
&gt; &gt; my &quot;folder&quot; for anyone to hear. it is under norther il ghost 
hunting 
&gt; &gt; team. thanks everone for your time.
