<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It is a simple concept as to why the vents cut down on feedback.  As a
former live sound engineer, feedback was quite the nemesis.

If I remember reading right, you have a small microphone and a small speaker
in your &quot;echo chamber.&quot;  A feedback loop happens when a speaker produces
audio and a microphone pics that audio up.  The thing is, if the speaker and
microphone are not far enough apart from one another, a feedback loop occurs
where the audio loop between microphone to speaker keeps building up and
frequencies start to converge into feedback.

Considering that your echo chamber is right under the batteries, the
microphone in the echo chamber is probably picking up the audio from the
main speaker output at the same time as the output that is in the echo
chamber.  The two sources picked up at the same time is causing the
feedback.   By venting the battery chamber, the soundwaves from the main
speaker  are being released easier from the hollow design of the box.  This
allows for the natural reverberation caused by speaker output to stop
reverberating around inside the box, it is this bouncing around of audio
that is= eventually picked up by your echo chamber microphone at the same
time and becomes feedback.

The same thing happens during a concert when a performer gets his microphone
to close to the floor monitor.  A feedback loop occurs because the singer
hear&#x27;s his voice in the floor monitor at the same time as it is coming out
of his mouth.  A loop occurs where the frequencies build upon each other and
feedback happens.  In your case, the microphone inside the echo chamber is
simply picking up the main speaker at the same time as the speaker in your
echo box, causing the same audio pattern.

Hope this helps,

Tim

&gt; The battery box is on top of the echo chamber, and venting the door helps
&gt; cut the feedback for some weird acoustical reason. The new box should be
&gt; &quot;92&quot; doh!

I is a simple concep as o why he en s cu down on eedback.  As a o me li e sound enginee , eedback was qui e he nemesis.  I I emembe eading igh , you ha e a small mic ophone and a small speake in you &quot;echo chambe .&quot;  A eedback loop happens when a speake p oduces audio and a mic ophone pics ha audio up.  The hing is, i he speake and mic ophone a e no a enough apa om one ano he , a eedback loop occu s whe e he audio loop be ween mic ophone o speake keeps building up and equencies s a o con e ge in o eedback.  
Conside ing ha you echo chambe is igh unde he ba e ies, he mic ophone in he echo chambe is p obably picking up he audio om he main speake ou pu a he same ime as he ou pu ha is in he echo chambe .  The wo sou ces picked up a he same ime is causing he eedback.   By en ing he ba e y chambe , he soundwa es om he main speake  a e being eleased easie om he hollow design o he box.  This allows o he na u al e e be a ion caused by speake ou pu o s op e e be a ing a ound inside he box, i is his bouncing a ound o audio ha is= e en ually picked up by you echo chambe mic ophone a he same ime and becomes eedback.
The same hing happens du ing a conce when a pe o me ge s his mic ophone o close o he loo moni o .  A eedback loop occu s because he singe hea &#x27;s his oice in he loo moni o a he same ime as i is coming ou o his mou h.  A loop occu s whe e he equencies build upon each o he and eedback happens.  In you case, he mic ophone inside he echo chambe is simply picking up he main speake a he same ime as he speake in you echo box, causing he same audio pa e n.
