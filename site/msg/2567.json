I don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve \nposted voices from my boxes(and other esources) that to me seem \nperfectly clear, and no one else can hear it. I think the concensus \nis that the voices are like to tuned to the individual, which makes \ngetting &quot;proof&quot; pretty difficult. I think this stuff is mostly to \nprove to the individual that life continues, and we get just enough \nthat can be shared to get others interested. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Windows Live Hotmail and Microsoft Office Outlook  together at \nlast.
