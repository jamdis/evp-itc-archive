&gt; After a good nights sleep and quite a few e-mails, I have decided to 
&gt; stick with the group on a limited basis so that I can offer advice 
&gt; from my experience to new people coming into the research.
&gt; 
&gt; I apologise for using this forum for my personal feelings but do not 
&gt; apologise for my reaction, I think it was an appropriate response to 
&gt; being called a fraud and a fake and lier.
&gt; 
&gt; Be that as it may, water under the bridge please forgive my inherent 
&gt; defense mechanism.
&gt; 
&gt; I will be here to help in any way I can and strive to ignore negative 
&gt; influence where ever it may come from.
&gt; 
&gt; I was also urged by mike and Lisa in a very definitive session today 
&gt; to return for the sake of harmony and good will. So I will try to 
&gt; live up to their ideal.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks for putting up with my outbursts.
