  Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Oujia Board Testing






  I have been te=
sting claimants of mediumship for many years. One of the central issues we =
constantly deal with is identifying the source of the anomalous information=
. First let's establish that "proof-oriented" research simply will not answ=
er this question. Proof-oriented research (such as does the supposed discar=
nate know specifici information) has been used in the past to establish tha=
t anomalous information transfer can occur.. "Anomalous information transfe=
r" is a fancy way of saying that something is known somehow to someone in a=
 way that seems impossible. Mediums giving legitimate reading for sitters i=
s one example, psychics having validated impressions is another.



  There=
 are other issues with proofs. One is that it appears that information does=
 not come through well when tests are too "factual" or there is no real nee=
d. In other words, experiments motivated solely by a "prove it" attitude, t=
end to fail. We think this is because of a form of experimenter effect. It =
has been observed that the attitudes of experimenters, especially in psycho=
logical research, can actually influence outcomes. A famous of experiments =
performed by Dr. Richard Wiseman and Dr. Marilyn Schlitz demonstrated this =
conclusively.



  Given these points, how to proceed? The answer lies in "=
process-oriented" research. Instead of worrying about proving things, espec=
ially since we already know that we can get proof of anomalous information =
transfer, we focus on how the process seems to work and not work. This give=
s us clues as to what might be going on and ultimately go give us greater c=
onfidence as to the source of the information. Note that I said, "could" as=
 in the future, as in we don't really know now. That is the state of the ar=
t at this time. So we don't have a way today to determine this yet. 



  T=
here are some other things you should know. There are three known ways that=
 apparent discarnate communications might be explained. These have been tou=
ched on in this and other threads, but it might be useful to review.



  T=
he first is known as "telepathy" or "thought transference". It involves two=
 living people sharing thoughts. Most ESP tests are contrived with the expe=
ctation of demonstrating telepathy. But there is a little problem. They can=
 as easily demonstrate "clarivoyance" which is the second know way of commu=
nicating. Clairvoyance (which literally means "clear seeing") is a supposed=
 ability that some have to see things that either are, were or will be. Som=
e people hear things instead of seeing them, this known as clairaudience. I=
n fact any sense can be appealed to in this way. The point is that an actua=
l event is being sensed and reported. So in the clairvoyant example, you ar=
e simply showing that someone might have known of an event in the past (whe=
n you recorded something for example), in the present (what's on a paper yo=
u placed in a location without looking yourself) or in the future (when the=
 contents of the paper were discovered).

  This problem was solved nicely =
in 1936 by Dr. Elizabeth McMann at Duke University when she developed the "=
true telepathy test." Simply put, the test requires that no target ever be =
recorded per se. Instead aliases for target are kept in memory and the alia=
ses compared post hoc.. This way there is never a physcial record of the ac=
tual targets - the only place the target object information exists is in th=
e minds of the subjects. So telepathy must be in play if successes are foun=
d and clairvoyance is effectively ruled out. One small detail though, subje=
cts can NEVER discuss the actual test objects throughout their lifetimes or=
 the test will be invalidated as precognitive clairvoyance could then becom=
e an explanation.



  Even if you didn't fully understand the preceding pa=
ragraphy, I hope you can see that tests of this sort are not trivial, and i=
mposing proper controls is sort of an art form.



  Of course the third ex=
planation for anomalous information transfer is based on After-Death Commun=
ication or ADC which is the unique provenance of the medium (as opposed to =
a psychic). 



  I hope this is of some interest.
