<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Do a google search for a free file converter if you have to.  You can 
Google in quotes, &quot;convert wma to wav&quot; for example.

&gt; Here is my problem. I have a digital recorder and it saves the 
files in WMA format. I tried saving the file in .wav, but it wont let 
me.  I have a 4 minute tape, but only need about 30 seconds of the 
tape as that is where I got my response. I am not very technical... 
This is frustrating as the EVP I got is really clear. i assume I can 
play the recorder and tape it again with sound recorder but then I 
lose clarity, I would imagine....  Does media player allow an edit of 
a file to take out x number of seconds and save to a .wav? have any 
ideas

&gt;    
&gt;   I am sure there are enough of us here that will help you out with 
the file.  You can send it to any of us and we would run it thru our 
software for you and send it back to you in bits and pieces.  I would 
also recommend cool edit 2.1 for editing the software.  It works 
great.....

&gt;             I used my 12-469 for the first time this morning, and 
ran a 4 minute tape session. One of the questions I asked was, &quot;When 
a person dies, do they see a white light?&quot;  After I asked this 
question the second time, I got a very distinct and crisp YES.  How 
can I save just that section of the file? Do I need to do that in the 
recorder, or can I do it in the .wave file I now have saved on my 
computer of the whole recording.
