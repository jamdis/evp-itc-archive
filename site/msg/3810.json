Give a listen when you have a couple  \nhours.\n\nI also listened to Steve H.&#39;s 2 hour recording from Eastern State  \nPenn last night. I found some of it amazing and some of it wildly  \nannoying, especially the researcher close by the microphone who was  \nchewing gum. That aside, there was more very odd and wonderful  \ncommunication, and also a lot of Chris seeing shadows, apparitions,  \nblack masses crawling down hallways, and other things that no one  \nelse seemed to see. I wanted to ask Steve H. if he had witnessed any  \nof this, since he was with Chris the whole time. For the listener,  \nthe effect was that of a veritable mob of live humans who (the posse  \nthat night) who were kept in a constant state of anxiety. They didn&#39;t  \nneed the extra hype, HMO, &#39;cause the pissed off dead inmates were  \nbeing surly enough on their own.\n\nI&#39;d say I agreed with Chris&#39;s interpretations--and granted, I was not  \nthere and did have problems hearing because of gum smacking and other  \npeople rustling and talking--about 30 percent of the time. That said,  \nI heard a lot of things loud and clear.\n\nAnn\n\n\nOn Dec 3, 2007, at 2:38 PM, Frank Sumption wrote:\n\n&gt;  Interesting.

Chris&#39;s box is quite\n&gt; capable of behaving like John Edward--directly bringing relations\n&gt; through to talk to those who need to hear them. Some of the responses\n&gt; were astoundingly clear and loud. It certainly sounded similar to what\n&gt; I have heard of what Bruce is getting, and honestly, it is exactly\n&gt; what I hope to get with my box when I receive it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you haven&#39;t listened to this, you really should. I think Chris\n&gt; made his usual statements about Edison and the 30, but aside from\n&gt; that, this was a wonderful session and people were extremely moved.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you want, I&#39;ll find the URL.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Sent: Dec 3, 2007 12:40 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: Group &lt;evp-itc@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Maybe there is only one box user allowed!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Christopher was immediately taken by what he had seen and heard.\n&gt; He was able to &gt; make a direct connection with spirits. inhabitants,\n&gt; victims, participants, and &gt; witnesses...describing amazing events and\n&gt; even some unspeakable acts that had &gt; happened within the walls of\n&gt; these notoriously haunted places. The details &gt; afforded by these\n&gt; spirits gave answers to lingering questions that could not &gt; have come\n&gt; from anyone but the parties involved. Already amazed by the &gt;\n&gt; instrument&#39;s ability to connect with these historical figures,\n&gt; Christopher soon &gt; realized that other entities were trying to reach\n&gt; out as well. Deceased fathers, &gt; sons, mothers, daughters, and friends\n&gt; of session participants were sending &gt; messages through the device.\n&gt; Talk of this spread, and last year, at the Ghost &gt; Chaser&#39;s Weekend\n&gt; Conference in Savannah, Georgia, Christopher was asked to do a &gt;\n&gt; presentation about his research with the Telephone to the Dead. This\n&gt; quickly &gt; turned into an impromtu public demonstration, with\n&gt; participants, one by one, &gt; coming forward requesting to speak with\n&gt; loved ones who had died. Surprisingly, &gt; even to Christopher, these\n&gt; requests were met with comforting and sometimes vital &gt; messages. The\n&gt; presentation was recorded and broadcasted by A.P.S.R. Radio.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From a recent add for another presentation, but apparently the\n&gt; rest of us get nothing like this, so it doesn&#39;t even work for us.\n&gt; Guess I&#39;ll just go back to killing time wth Ham radio, and quit\n&gt; wasting all my time and money on useless boxes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Curious that no one else gets any &quot;real&quot; contacts--event the so\n&gt; called box inventor gets nothing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt;__________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt;You keep typing, we keep giving.
