<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>But what is going on now? Why all of a sudden is everyone hearing  
from Edison and Tesla? If these are the real men, what are they up  
to? Are they trying to divide and concur or are they working together?

&gt; I can tell you some of the real story of these two men (much  
&gt; abbreviated
&gt; version).
&gt;
&gt; Nikola Tesla worked for Edison for a while but they had a falling-out
&gt; because Tesla thought of improvements to Edison&#x27;s inventions that  
&gt; Edison,
&gt; due to ego or whatever, didn&#x27;t think much of. Tesla also had a  
&gt; habit of
&gt; ordering the most expensive chateaubriand at Edison&#x27;s expense when  
&gt; Edison
&gt; took him out to dinner. They eventually parted ways.
&gt;
&gt; Tesla happened upon George Westinghouse&#x27;s lab when Westinghouse needed
&gt; repairs to a motor. Tesla went into the shop and machined such a
&gt; high-quality repair that Westinghouse was immediately impressed. So  
&gt; Tesla
&gt; ended up working for Westinghouse at that point.
&gt;
&gt; Tesla had the idea of developing alternating-current systems for power
&gt; distribution and Westinghouse backed it all the way. AC was much more
&gt; efficient than Edison&#x27;s DC power distribution systems because it  
&gt; lacked
&gt; the heat losses in the power lines that DC systems suffered from.  
&gt; Edison
&gt; stood to lose much if his DC power systems were discarded in favor  
&gt; of AC
&gt; power. So he invented the electric chair to demonstrate to the public
&gt; just how dangerous AC was. The first attempt at using it on a death- 
&gt; row
&gt; inmate failed miserably; it didn&#x27;t kill him but amounted to torture
&gt; instead.
&gt;
&gt; Tesla went on to do his own research; much was funded by J. P. Morgan.
&gt; That&#x27;s a whole &#x27;nother story. But he and Westinghouse remained  
&gt; friends;
&gt; he and Edison remained enemies.
&gt;
&gt; Tesla was a very bad manager of money. He died in a hotel room in New
&gt; York, with very little money at that time.
&gt;
&gt; Another interesting anecdote - Tesla had taken to letting the  
&gt; pigeons into
&gt; his hotel room, which the hotel owners didn&#x27;t enjoy but tolerated  
&gt; because
&gt; of his notoriety. He had a favorite pigeon which sat on his phone.  
&gt; He had
&gt; said several times that &quot;The day that my favorite pigeon dies, I will
&gt; die.&quot; And so it happened.

&gt; &gt; Okay-- in your opinion--what is all this Tesla/Edison stuff  
&gt; about? It&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; getting as weird as as John Keel book around here.
