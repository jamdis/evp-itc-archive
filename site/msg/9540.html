&gt; Hello Rhonda and Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I have heard my name called out loud before, but it was not an EVP
situation it was after my first girlfriend died. I was 17. She was 15.
She had had her second kidney transplant a few months earlier and died
of gas gangrene.
&gt; 
&gt; She died at 3:15 PM and I felt it. I knew that she had died. It is
very difficult to explain, but I knew that she was gone. So, it wasn&#x27;t
surprising to me when I got home from school and my eldest sister was
on the phone telling my Mother that Rena had died.
&gt; 
&gt; My Mother had moved us to Texas from Oklahoma a few months earlier.
I knew that Rena wasn&#x27;t doing good as she was before I left, but no
one expected her to die. She made a turn for the worse late that
morning and by 3:15 she was gone. 
&gt; 
&gt; Late that afternoon I took the Greyhound bus back to my hometown in
Oklahoma. When I got to my sisters house, it was around 1 am. My
sister is 18 years older than me, so I have a niece that is a year
younger than me. My niece and I both heard Rena call my name and I
then heard her call my name again a little later before I went to bed.
That night after I had gone to sleep, it woke me up as I felt someone
sit on the side of my bed. I knew it was Rena telling me she was okay,
but this was before I knew anything about the paranormal, so I was a
bit scared to open my eyes and see her. 
&gt; 
&gt; She was my first love and I am hoping that I will hear from her
someday via EVP/ITC.
&gt; 
&gt; I consider myself very blessed to of heard her call my name and sit
beside me to let me know she was okay. 
&gt; 
&gt; Wishing everyone a wonderful weekend.

Hi read books by Robert Monroe.

He had the ability to travel out of the body and go to the Astral.

There are Technologically advanced Aliens that seem to control the
political situation in the Astral planes, and they do not want Earth
humans to develop full communication with human spirits in the Astral.

WE HUMANS ARE BEING EXPLOITED IN THE ASTRAL PLANES, that is why when
communications are going good, all of a sudden you no longer hear from
the spirit any more, THAT IS BECAUSE THE SPIRIT WAS FORBIDDEN to
communicate further.

WE NEED TO START DOING SERIOUS RESEARCH AND NOT GET ALL EXCITED TO
JUST HEAR VOICES.

WE also need to study the physics involved, this is high energy physics.</pre>
