There&#39;s the messages tuned to a specific individual, so no one\nis going ot hear it the same if at all. Everyone is wired different, and\njust because no two poeple hear an EVP the same does not invalidate it.\n\n Maybe you should go debunk music, no one hears songs the same either.\n\n Frank-S\n\nOn Wed, May 26, 2010 at 7:10 AM, Rj &lt;rasterer@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   But only  when they&#39;re told what to listen for.
