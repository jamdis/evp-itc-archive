I still have to get all my webcam software running \ncorrectly \n&gt; so for now I was just using quickcam and sports video player to \nview \n&gt; frame by frame.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I asked them to help me test it and I had alot of fuzzy faces \nsome of \n&gt; which I saved in paintbrush (as usual) but they lost some of thier \n&gt; color intensity. Not sure why yet. I still have to hammer that bug \nout. \n&gt; They seemed eager to test as well and eventually a few clearer \nfaces \n&gt; started to come thru. It will take a while for me to stop messing \nwith \n&gt; settings and to get back on track but eventually I will.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Enjoy.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I will add them to the gallery later when I get time.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Misty\n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;  \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; How low will we go?
