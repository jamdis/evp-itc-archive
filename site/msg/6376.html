<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Gimme some opinions on this one, gang. The first part of the clip is
the speed it can through at. The repeat is slowed by about 70 percent.
I hear it as &quot;Estep.&quot; I thought I had heard the word yes, so I ask,
&quot;Yes?&quot; Under my voice is the name &quot;Andrew,&quot; then &quot;I&#x27;m Stu.&quot; &quot;Perfect.&quot;
&quot;No..??...asshole...fucking scared.&quot;

Do you hear this as I do? I&#x27;m postulating right now that because I
live immediately across the street from a cemetery, and in a
100-year-old sitting atop a 200+-year-old foundation and cellar, that
perhaps local dead folk who haven&#x27;t crossed are popping in during
sessions. The voice that said &quot;fucking scared&quot; I swear I heard in
another file in my folder saying &quot;scared people.&quot;
