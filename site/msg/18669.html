<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>If you read back in some of the earliest messages on the group, you&#x27;ll find
out that Frank built his boxes with a totally different purpose than
receiving communications from &quot;ghosts.&quot; It appears the entities who have
been communicating through Frank&#x27;s boxes are NOT ghosts at all. They are
something else. I guess &quot;spirit technicians&quot; seems to describe them best. We
still don&#x27;t know who or where they are or what their purpose is. But they&#x27;re
there somewhere, apparently.

&gt;  I don&#x27;t have the time and resources to mass produce this stuff. Besides, I
&gt; find what most want to use the boxes for, ghost hunting and demon chasing
&gt; very discouraging. I don&#x27;t know of anyone that uses this stuff, be it hack
&gt; boxes, or any other method to try to actually get higher level contacts. No
&gt; one just allows the entities to speak, all want to second guess something
&gt; that has more access and is in a higher state of being. Everyone wants to be
&gt; TAPS, and get the crap scared out themselves. Most hear only what they want
&gt; to hear. I don&#x27;t know what the answer is.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Well, &quot;the box&quot; in nothing more than a radio with swept tuning--as far as
&gt;&gt; I know and have experienced, sweep across the radios tuning range, or band
&gt;&gt; generates bits of speech music and noise that the entities use to reform
&gt;&gt; into their voices, although there maybe more involved, but I don&#x27;t know how
&gt;&gt; one would test it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Most of the boxes for sale out there are the hack radio boxes. Many of
&gt;&gt; the modern digital radios have a function that mutes, or quiets the radio
&gt;&gt; while tuning between stations. I&#x27;m not sure why, but unmutting the radio
&gt;&gt; allows the audio to be heard while the radio searches for the next
&gt;&gt; station--and--the radio is disallowed form locking onto a station, so it
&gt;&gt; keeps sweeping all the way to the end of the band--AM or FM, then starts
&gt;&gt; over. This creates the raw audio and &quot;they&quot; speak. The sweep can even be
&gt;&gt; done by hand, tuning a radio slowing by hand. I sue cheap radios I get at
&gt;&gt; thrift stores for this, gluing a dowel to the tuning knob to make it easier.
&gt;&gt; Then record form the speaker--open air.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  So as long as the radio sweeps at not to fast and not too slow, it&#x27;ll
&gt;&gt; works. Some are better than others.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  It takes some practice, and maybe even a certain allowing to hear the
&gt;&gt; ghost voices.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I prefer to take a tuner out of a radio, such as a clock radio and supply
&gt;&gt; an external sweep voltage. The sweep circuits are just basic op amps, and
&gt;&gt; you can buy a function generator kit to supply a triangle wave for linear
&gt;&gt; sweep. See keyportparanormal.com for more info on using this kit, and
&gt;&gt; building boxes.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  One problem with this stuff is that it can be extremely subjective,
&gt;&gt; others may not hear what you hear, or hear it the same. I think mostly the
&gt;&gt; messages are meant for the one that receives it. We go round and round with
&gt;&gt; the skeptics and debunkers.

&gt;&gt; Ok, we&#x27;re new here hello!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We just had a couple questions. HOW do you tell if you&#x27;re being ripped off
&gt;&gt; if you are searching online to buy a box? If you can point us in the right
&gt;&gt; direction of where to purchase a &quot;frank&#x27;s box&quot; would be deeply appreciated.
&gt;&gt; We saw that you can try and make your own but with my husband&#x27;s work
&gt;&gt; schedule and mine with 4 kids, sports etc.. the only time we get to work
&gt;&gt; with EVP&#x27;s and such is when we schedule an investigation and secure a
&gt;&gt; babysitter! LOL Not to mention my husband isn&#x27;t that technologically
&gt;&gt; inclined. That is my job... and I would be afraid that I&#x27;d have done
&gt;&gt; something incorrectly and what we were experiencing really wasn&#x27;t &quot;true&quot;.
&gt;&gt; Sorry to sound like such a newbie I&#x27;m sure!
