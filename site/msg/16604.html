I always have used the boards from Radio shack.  One , in particular, is 
made like a card that can be plugged into a 40 "pin" card slot.  The card 
will let one mount IC chip sockets and has "wires" that carry the power. 
all one needs to do is soldier in the discrete components onto the 
separate pads and make connections with short "jumper wires. the plug in 
card thing is quite easy to mount in a cabinet and work on.  Looks neat 
too---unlike the "wire nests" I used to make when I first started building 
circuits.
