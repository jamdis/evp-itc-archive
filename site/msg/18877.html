Jennifer,
I had this long reply posted and for whatever reason I clicked se=
nd and it made me sign in again! It always seems to happen that way! (Espec=
ially when I sit here thinking oh.. the won't be interested in a personal e=
xperience!)
Ok, my son was a twin. He didn't know it. His twin died in uter=
o around the time the 2nd trimester started. They wanted to do a D&C becaus=
e they said if the one twin died he died too. They refused another ultrasou=
nd a few days later to "be sure" and I refused to allow them to do the surg=
ery as I had stopped bleeding and had no more issues after those first few =
days. I made an appointment with a new OB. I went in a few days later and t=
he first thing they did was an ultrasound. There was my son and his big str=
ong heartbeat just fine. If I wouldn't have went with my gut my 12 year old=
 wouldn't be here right now.
That being said.. several years ago he came to=
 me because he said this boy came to him, told him he was his twin in his d=
reams and talked to him. I didn't say much at the time because I was in sho=
ck. My husband had no clue about what happened with my first husband and my=
 pregnancy with him at that point.=C2=A0After what we experienced in 2004 i=
n a home we lived in I started to open my eyes to a lot and believe in thin=
gs that I never would have imagined.=C2=A0This "boy" has come around here a=
nd there to our son. He now knows he was a twin. Is it his brother? Honestl=
y, I do not know. I'd like to think perhaps it is and he's looking over him=
!
No one can explain certain things. Somethings might never have an explana=
tion. Some people can't handle this so if this happens it's no true because=
 there is no scientific explanation...=C2=A0
There are so many things that =
I've experienced in life that I'd love to be able to open up about. It took=
 everything I had back in 2004 to walk into the church rectory. I remember =
looking at our priest saying either there is something in our home or you n=
eed to commit me.=C2=A0I was raised don't talk about it, it's all your imag=

      Yes, it was your post. I only=
 question what are subconscious may know that we do not. It is due to the w=
hole idea of automatic writing. I have written things I don't feel are from=
 me. Psychology would say it is probably just my subconscious. So I jump be=
tween realms of thought. I could downplay certain psychic abilities with ps=
ychology. It has left me wondering if I am really talking to my dead sister=
 or if it a way of processing the past. I forget the details, but I guess m=
y mom was going to have twins, but I was what came.

     I do know that ps=
ychology cannot explain certain things. Your post got me really interested =
in that device. I believe everything is connected. I do not doubt that you =
heard no sirens and such or your experience. I guess I just question how it=
 works, as all of us do here.

Thank you for your thoughts and prayers.

Sometimes the ridicule gets hard to take. I know that sometimes mind does i=

It was about Global consciousness project. Someone had posted about an expe=
rience where they were told by device about a wreck around the corner, or s=
omething like that. I wonder if their subconscious picked up on it and it m=
anifested on their device. I know it could be other things as well. As huma=
