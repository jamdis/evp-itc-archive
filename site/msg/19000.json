This time in Paranormal Magazine which is based in the U.K.\n\nA paranormal investigator investigating the Ancient Ram Inn said the following in his article:\n\n&quot;My final encounter involved the &quot;Frank&#39;s Box&quot;, a controversial new tool within the paranormal field. Developed by a man named Frank Sumption, this box is also known as the &quot;Telephone to the Dead&quot;, and can alledgedly communicate with the other side.&quot;\n\nI enjoy Paranormal Magazine a lot and find this magazine much better than the one left still operating in the U.S. that I know about, the paranormal magazine out of southern New England. This magazine also runs articles and stories from the U.S. The above quote was taken from their August 2010 magazine. This magazine apparently comes out monthly.\n\nCheers,\nCB"}
