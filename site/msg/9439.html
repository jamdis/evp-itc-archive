My boyfriend saw on the Cash and Treasures show where you could go 
and dig your own Black Fire Opals in Denio Nevada (which is a 5-6 
hour drive) Some lady found one that was suppose to be worth 
$50,000! So off we went to mine for Black Fire Opals. The digging 
fee was $145 for the day per person. Need less to say it was hard 
work and the only thing we ended up with was Opal boogers it was 
hot, dusty and windy there. But the camping was fun. 

I dont know how far you are from Herkimer New York but you can go 
dig for Herkimer diamonds they are awesome for spirit commucation. 
Wish I was closer I would go but I am way out on the west coast in 
California.

&gt; If anyone in this group lives near Arkansas you can go dig 
crystals and get them free. All we had to pay was a digging fee 
which was, then, just a few dollars. It may of gone up by now. This 
was in the early 90&#x27;s when my (first) wife and I went a couple of 
times to Hot Springs, Arkansas to dig crystals. At that time I lived 
in Texas (I am originally from Oklahoma), so it was about a four 
hour drive from Dallas.
&gt; 
&gt; We had a wonderful time and found a plethora of beautiful 
crystals. Even some sizable clusters. The energy of the crystals is 
very strong when you bring them out of the dirt as they have been in 
Mother Earth their whole lives. They have a rust color appearance 
and they have to be soaked in the solution that you use to clean 
pools. I would say all in all each trip we netted about ten pounds 
or so of crystals. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, if any of you like to camp there are numerous wonderful 
state parks in that area that have very nice camping facilities, 
plus even some cabins and shelters. The lakes there are crystal 
clear and you can see to the bottom. We found Lake De Grey the most 
beautiful of the ones in that area that we visited.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this helps.
