<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Told ya! Let the friggin&#x27; entities talk, and you might get 
something more meaningful, but then that wouldn&#x27;t justify the ego 
crap, and the so called theories, and paranormal expertise.  So what 
good is it doing to ask all the &quot;right&quot; questions when you get vague 
junk back!? You have to let go the presumptions, and everything you 
think you know. 

 What makes you two(Steve and Bruce) think you are so special that 
you can get the answers to technology questions when they don&#x27;t even 
tell me, Stefan, Bill, Ron, or any physical techs anything! At least 
we could implement any technical suggestions. Y&#x27;all wouldn&#x27;t know 
microfarad from a microbus(VW). 

 I think your guides quit talking cuz you&#x27;re both are ego tripping 
into outter space. Yet you&#x27;re pissed cuz I wouldn&#x27;t allow myself to 
obligated to you for &quot;donations&quot;. 

 I been tryin&#x27; to hold back, but this girl&#x27;s still got hair trigger!

 So &#x27;nuff public venting!
