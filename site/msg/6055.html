<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Misty .. on the link below you can click on &quot;Where to watch&quot; and 
it will tell you when it will air in your area.  

Hi Ann .. I&#x27;ve never seen the whole show online .. We all sat in a 
circle (Me, Jeffrey Wands, my Team, and the Producers) .. We asked 
questions and recorded in complete silence and also as Jeffrey was 
speaking and so much of what Jeffrey said was validated in the Evp 
recordings.  We had over fifty Evp&#x27;s. The exciting part is that Maury 
doesn&#x27;t sound skeptical anymore .. 

Just a small part of what went on was featured in the show ... One of 
the other segments had a little boy who sees a girl spirit who plays 
with the toys in his room.  I was speaking to him backstage and his 
stories were amazing!  He can&#x27;t wait to move.

&gt; Debbie--will the show be available in its entirety online? If not,  
&gt; after it airs, can you give us a synopsis of what it covered and 
what  
&gt; you found?
