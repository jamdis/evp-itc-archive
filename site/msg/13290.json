As for me personally I grew up surrounded by unexplained events and\n&gt; my parents tried to ignore the things that they couldnt see because if you\n&gt; ignore it then it doesnt exist right? But there comes a time when the child\n&gt; grows up and forms thier own ideas and beliefs. Personally speaking once I\n&gt; reached adulthood there were many other people who experienced the same\n&gt; things I did in that house so I began to see that there was more to it than\n&gt; just a childs imagination.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most religions are based upon the idea that there is a higher power, that\n&gt; we all have spirits, and that there is something beyond this life. To say\n&gt; that someone is wrong for belief in ghosts I would have to say that billions\n&gt; of others are wrong for having belief at all. I dont think bad of a parent\n&gt; who takes their kids off to church every sunday nor do I think badly about a\n&gt; parent who spends some time doing ITC. Telling a child that there is more\n&gt; than what the eye can see, more than what the ears can hear, is giving them\n&gt; the basics for growing up with a mind thats open to possibility. What they\n&gt; do with that is up to them individually.\n&gt;\n&gt; I worry more about the kids who grow up with parents who are alchoholics,\n&gt; drug addicts, liars, thieves, abusers, etcetera.. than anyone.\n&gt;\n&gt; As for if the effect is positive or negative, I think that has to do with\n&gt; the intent or the approach taken by each individual whether it be ITC,\n&gt; religion, or life in general.\n&gt;\n&gt; Misty\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Thu, 1/22/09, Rick &lt;rasterer@... &lt;rasterer%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: Rick &lt;rasterer@... &lt;rasterer%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Sociological question\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, January 22, 2009, 10:57 AM\n&gt; &gt; I was wondering if anyone had an opinion on the impact of\n&gt; &gt; performing\n&gt; &gt; ITC experiments or sessions, when there are young children\n&gt; &gt; around. Do\n&gt; &gt; you think the children seeing their parents or others (in\n&gt; &gt; person, not\n&gt; &gt; on TV) engaging in this activity would have an effect on\n&gt; &gt; the children,\n&gt; &gt; and if so, do you think the effect would be positive, or\n&gt; &gt; negative?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI hink ha he child en may e en be be e a hea ing he oices.On Thu, Jan 22, 2009 a 1:12 PM, Mis y Dawn bulle babea@yahoo.com> w o e:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n RJ\nI hink he answe s will a y om indi idual o indi idual based on hie belie s.
