&gt; Well replying to digest certainly makes sense.  I had to drop digest years ago because of that.

&gt; I was just having a hard time figuring out which responses were for which posts.
&gt; No biggie but I figured if I was having the problem, other would as well.  Plus
&gt; a reply without the context is usually nonsensical so it does not help the understanding.
&gt;
&gt; Again, just my perspective but I&#x27;ve found as I&#x27;ve gotten older that if I don&#x27;t understand something there
&gt; is usually a dozen or more others that don&#x27;t either that just did not ask.
