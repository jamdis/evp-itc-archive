I&#39;m very interested in the box and how it works.  I&#39;m\n&gt; going to attempt to make one myself, though I have to admit...I&#39;m not\n&gt; real sure I&#39;m going to be able to remember all I learned in industrial\n&gt; arts class 22 years ago. LOL.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been lurking a few days and I&#39;ve noticed there&#39;s a debate going on.\n&gt; Is debate the right word? Anyway I&#39;m wanting to find out, for myself, if\n&gt; the box works.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any tips?\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
