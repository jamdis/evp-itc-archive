<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Jon, 

Posting a link to relevant information is not spam with respect to 
ITC - especially radio programs that are invaluable. Many here are 
trying to glean as much understanding of the technologies from as 
many knowledgable sources as possible.  If someone were to post links 
to Viagra, The Lottery, etc., then I would agree with you. Geesh...
