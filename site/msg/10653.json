I have extra hardware laying around here(yes, I&#39;m a computer engineer geek ;) ) that I&#39;ll setup some other trials and test to run today as well.  I thought the live web feed was pretty interesting in the fact that I have someone else with positive energy working with me, even if it&#39;s remotely.  I&#39;ve also done live feeds with my night vision cameras on a box research session with my friend.  I&#39;m trying to work out the kinks in it so others can try it out with me if they want.  \n\n  I haven&#39;t  heard of Lance Reed, at least I don&#39;t think I have, so thanks for the link.  I&#39;ll check out his site right now.  \n\nThanks,\nBryan\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Sunday, April 27, 2008 12:19:05 PM\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] Re: My first YouTube video (yep!
