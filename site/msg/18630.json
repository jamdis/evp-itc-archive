You take the high road.\nIf you feel you must say something, you can say &quot;we&#39;ll have to agree to\ndisagree,&quot; or &quot;that is your opinion,&quot; etc, because it is just their opinion.\nNo need to get personal, insulting, emotional or overly defensive. If you\nbelieve in what you are doing, what does it matter what anyone else in the\nwhole universe believes?\n\nThere is intelligent debate, and then there is petty arguments. Getting\npetty does nothing for you or your cause, and only brings you down to your\nopponents petty levels.\n\nThe old adage really holds true-if you can&#39;t say something nice, don&#39;t say\nanything at all.\n\n\nOn Thu, Aug 26, 2010 at 9:29 AM, purplespacefriend &lt;\npurplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; So if someone is saying that something you have worked on for years is all\n&gt; in your head while they completely ignore all evidence and results, you just\n&gt; sit quiet, don&#39;t say a word cuz someone might get upset?\n&gt;\n&gt; In the meantime, if some chase only the dark shadows, &quot;investigate&quot; in the\n&gt; dark at night, get growling voices saying &quot;get oput&quot;--that must be the\n&gt; absolute truth!\n&gt;\n&gt; There seems to be no way to beat the negativity on this planet.
