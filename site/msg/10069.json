But \ni can&#39;t seem to get a full message that is clear enough that other \npeople can hear too.  And some want our posts to be unamed files, so \nthey can&#39;t be misled to hearing what we hear.  That has never worked \nout either, i&#39;m just saying there has to be another way that can be \nclearer.  Maybe a clearer box will be made in the future....who knows.\n\n-Steve\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Michael Edwards &lt;f1cracker75@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; That is funny! I was thinking the same thing while listening to \nthose recordings.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   In a box recording you can get an assemblance of male or female, \nand you can even get language accents. ie british, indian, spanish, \netc...\n&gt;    \n&gt;   With the allophone/soap, you have one electroinic voice.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   So lets say you are recording, and like you said, you have two \nspirits speaking at the same time. happens quite a bit with box \nradio, how does the researcher discern who is talking. Even if the \nspirits say at the beginning that this is bobby sue or james, you can \nnot tell the difference.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Imagine if the allaphone voice sounded like HAL 9000!\n&gt;    \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; psfponies &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           HaHa maybe your going to have to fight about whats better \nthe box or \n&gt; soapsound.\n&gt; \n&gt; I personnally dont like the robotic sounding voice with the \n&gt; soapsound. You can never tell whos talking everyone sounds the \n&gt; same. \n&gt; \n&gt; Kay\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yeah, i think i hear that too. I&#39;m probably going to just scrap \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; session, i spent 2 hours going over 45 seconds to bring out a \n&gt; message \n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s so unclear to everyone else. It&#39;s so frustrating that the \n&gt; &gt; radio method is so flawed, i want it to be clear and it never is. \n&gt; &gt; And if i do get something that&#39;s interesting, most people will \nsay \n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s just radio anyway. That&#39;s why i&#39;m trying to get away from \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; radios, although it&#39;s robotic sounding---sound soap has been the \n&gt; best \n&gt; &gt; so far. Clearer and longer messages, with hardly any editing. \n&gt; The \n&gt; &gt; boxes are unable to get full sentences from them and i don&#39;t care \n&gt; &gt; what anybody else claims to get. You will get some good &quot;yes&quot; \n&gt; &gt; and &quot;no&quot; answers, but the rest will be questioned and heard \n&gt; &gt; differently by others. What does everyone else on this board \n&gt; think \n&gt; &gt; about this?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The only word I cant really make out is &quot;DIE&quot; kind of sounds \n&gt; like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; FIGHT to me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Steves_gonna_fight_thats_horrible\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@...m wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; group.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; File : /Steve Hultay Files/Steve Hultay&#39;s Frank&#39;s Box \n&gt; &gt; &gt; #27/steve&#39;s_gonna_die_horrible (Slowed down 10%).mp3 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Uploaded by : urkel232002 &lt;urkel23@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Description : &quot;Steve&#39;s Gonna Die Horrible&quot;---Does anybody \n&gt; else \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hear this?---Slowed it down another 10 percent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Steve%20Hultay%\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 20Files/Steve%20Hultay%27s%20Frank%27s%20Box%20%2327/steve%\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 27s_gonna_die_horrible%20%28Slowed%20down%2010%25%29.mp3 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.ht\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mlfiles\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; urkel232002 &lt;urkel23@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                            \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Michael Edwards:  f1cracker75@...\n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
