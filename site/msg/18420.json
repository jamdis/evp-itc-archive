You are not accepting the evidence the experiments are showing.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have other experiments, or changes to the current conditions, I am happy to try to accommodate them.  But just calling people names from the sidelines doesn&#39;t really add anything to the research, doesn&#39;t really advance any of your points, and certainly doesn&#39;t reflect well on your claims\n&gt; \n&gt; Rj\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 8/4/10, purplespacefriend &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: purplespacefriend &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Experiment 3 - Results!\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, August 4, 2010, 8:07 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;        Y&#39;all don&#39;t get it! Paranormal stuff does not seem to work on demand like this. Much has to do with expectation, and if the one doing the testing expects no results, that&#39;s usually what comes of these tests. The only result is making the participants look like idiots. Many skeptics pull this testing crap, and they are notorious for changing the rules and conditions to make all things paranormal go away. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I said this at the start of this crap that there was only one result possible, to make all paticipants look foolish for believing in ghosts. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; People like this will not allow themselves to hear EVPs, as they can&#39;t trust their hearing, and are convinced by other eskeptics that that it&#39;s all the brain fooling itself, and somehow their hearing is superior to everyone else&#39;s. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think much of the paranormal depends on expectations, and if one expects to test this stuff with no results, that&#39;s what they get. There is a certain openness and allowing that is required.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Everyone of these test is just more ammo for the skeptics that want the world to conform to what some authority figure says is ok the think about. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve had it with this group, it&#39;s not bad enough to get these pompus skeptics that accept no evidence, but then there&#39;s the one&#39;s the know so much better that the boxes can&#39;t work, despite the fact that thousands use the method and get two way, verifiable communications. Not good enouhg, they want Slimmer from Ghost Busters to jump out of the box and slap them one the side of the head.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Alot of verbage that be ignored anyway. It either has to be all TAPS, or all debunking. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; F-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rasterer&quot; &lt;rasterer@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks to everyone who participated in Experiment 3.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Friday, 7/30/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer monitor, right in front of me, and left it there until noon Denver time on Monday, 8/2/2010.   This experiment asked for participants to determine what that object was. Vague or partial answers won&#39;t be counted (for example, just giving a color, shape, size,  what it&#39;s made of, etc): we&#39;re looking for what it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#39;t count.  Participants could use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means they chose.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the object at the start of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group.  The idea with this file is that you could download it at the beginning of the experiment and &#39;keep it safe&#39; on your computer. Then at the end of the experiment, I would post the password so you could reveal the contents of the file. That way, you were in control of the original image during the entire time, not me.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Passworded pdf: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100730.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The password for that file is: 867530Nieine\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So to the results:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Number of participants: 2\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Total tries: 3\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ambiguous answers: 0\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Correct answers: 0\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Object: A Pot\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Object picture: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100730.jpg\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let me know. Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this experiment.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
