I had asked if anyone was here with a message, or if Mike & Lisa was there, or if John Lennon would like to say something (was it him??), then listened!  Has any of you experienced this???  =Judy=\n&gt;\n  P.S. This effect, I got, is like doing the sweep/scan and not only hearing voices/words (popping up) but also like someone&#39;s talking in the background thru-out the sweep/scan!!!   Anyone have this happen to them?  =Judy="}
