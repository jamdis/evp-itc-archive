<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I just joined and have been a member of Grass Harp and a personal 
friend of both current owners for almost as long, and Frank that&#x27;s a bold faced lie. As a 
matter of fact when some people said they were glad you left one of the owners said you 
admitted to over reacting and you apologized to the them for your 
temper tantrum in defense of you. I guess you forgot about that apology.

Vicki, the owner allows everyone to post from the beginning but 
new members are moderated until one of the owners sees they aren&#x27;t spammers and then 
removes moderation.That is clearly explained on the first page about new 
member moderation.

It&#x27;s a good idea to get your info correct before talking about people 
behind their backs. I&#x27;dstay as I&#x27;m an active member on many paranormal lists, but this has 
really left a bad taste. The owners of Grass Harp are fine people, and I&#x27;ll certainly alert 
them to this.

Grow up Frank. And to anyone else who plans on staying in Frank&#x27;s enemy camp here, you 
are missing some other really good lists.</pre>
