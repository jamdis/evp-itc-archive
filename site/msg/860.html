<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Richard, I really enjoyed exploring your haunted WW2 artifacts site. Fascinating! Plus it 
helps I&#x27;ve enjoyed researching all the events surrounding WW2 and since I spend most of 
my efforts in researching all things paranormal, it has a nice one, two punch. -Bill Murphy

&gt; Misty ...  Thanks for the welcome. Don&#x27;t know if I know any of the 
&gt; members here. I was hoping to be able to speak with Frank one on one 
&gt; however, I do not have his email address.  I&#x27;m certain that if he 
&gt; visits my website he will contact me.
