<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I guess when i&#x27;ve looked at itc video i study the images intently to
try to see what is there, its not always easy. So being in that sort
of mode I&#x27;ve gone into my game just perusing things out of habit like
i do an itc image and bang i see all these itc type images. They are
there all right. I asked a friend of mine to take a look and see if he
could see them and he could.

Might just be something due to the nature of the graphics or
overwriting graphics with graphics as most of the images look
cartoonish or like drawings.. but not all.

Anyway just one more thing for me to explore, makes my game more
interesting:)

&gt; Yes, and that&#x27;s why those that try to communicate with us use these
talents
&gt; of our minds.It is the easiest method.

&gt; &gt;   Nope, not crazy.  You have to remember that the human mind excels at
&gt; &gt; pattern recognition.  It is what we do better than any other animal or
&gt; &gt; machine.  When we see or hear something that almost looks or
sounds like
&gt; &gt; something else, then our mind attempts to match it to known patterns.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is why EVPs and ITCs are so difficult, because we have to be
&gt; &gt; constantly on guard against our own minds and it&#x27;s love of pattern
matching

&gt; &gt;  Years ago I noticed that some formations on walls and the like looked
&gt; &gt; a lot like faces in the wood, concrete or paint or whatever. Now i&#x27;ve
&gt; &gt; been looking around in my house at the walls and the like and I see
&gt; &gt; hundreds of faces like you see in ITC. In the on-line game I play I
&gt; &gt; stopped to observe some of the walls and the like in the game and
&gt; &gt; there they are mixed in with the wall, almost like they make up
the wall.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In the wall paper of my win xp desktop landscape I see them as well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else notices this sort of thing or if im just
&gt; &gt; out of my mind:)
