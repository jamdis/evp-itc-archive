On a HAPPIER NOTE :) I was lucky enough to cat=\r\nch the RR-DR60 taking a nap yesterday....it missed a few evp&#39;s real close t=\r\nogether (in a 5 second clip) the Sony ICD-B7 heard a male use a different n=\r\number than what I used. I said 16 (my earlier age I was saying in recorder)=\r\n and the male evp said 13....then a female laughs. All this was missed by t=\r\nhe DR60 (except my 16 was recorded in both recorders) BUT then the DR60 &quot;ca=\r\nught&quot; the B7 &quot;napping&quot; at near the end of the 5 second clip....the DR60 hea=\r\nrd &quot;let me out&quot; in a clear (quite) males voice.

I said 16 (my earlier age I was saying in \n =\r\n           recorder) and the male evp said 13....then a female laughs. All =\r\nthis \n            was missed by the DR60 (except my 16 was recorded in both=\r\n recorders) \n            BUT then the DR60 &quot;caught&quot; the B7 &quot;napping&quot; at nea=\r\nr the end of the 5 \n            second clip....the DR60 heard &quot;let me out&quot; =\r\nin a clear (quite) males \n            voice. So this is very promising piec=\r\ne of evidence for me. **those 2 \n            recordings have been uploaded =\r\nto my folder. I will include an \n            Olympus W-10 (soon as arrives)=\r\n, Panasonic RR-US360 (when I think to \n            grab it) and my RR-QR80 =\r\nto go with my RR-QR100, and one more (can&#39;t \n            remember what bran=\r\nd-model of this last---due to arrive) LOL. I need \n            to build a m=\r\nultiple mounting devise to aid in putting these into \n            tandem se=\r\nrvice. Then I think I will use my Olympus DS-50 as my \n            &quot;Control=\r\n&quot; recorder....&lt;WBR&gt;by using it on the HQ settings.
