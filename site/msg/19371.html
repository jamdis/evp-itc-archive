<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>All I know about 2012 worth remembering is that different people say a bunch of different cultures all point toward something happening in  2012... ****if**** this is true, then that&#x27;s some crazy-*** **it, indeed!!  The other thing I heard about it is that nasa-confirmed the sun&#x27;s going to be throwing some temper tantrums worse than usual....  personally, if it makes the power go out, I&#x27;m all for it, our modern pace is way to fast, unnatural and stressful... as far as rioting and looting, I&#x27;ll leave that to the idiots who still believe they can eat, drink and sleep money :)  If I have to break my veganism at that point, I will be well justified in doing so, I&#x27;ll be the first one out there hunting deer if I have to... and if a giant asteriod is supposed to land on my a** in 2012, then I&#x27;m not even going to worry about it till then, lol!
