<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Got this radio from Hultay some time ago and ran across it last night, I
didn&#x27;t think I could I make it work, the front panel is missing, I think it
got lost in our move, so I don&#x27;t know what brand it is. Just step by step,
first figure out how to turn it on, and determine what each wire does that
comes from the processor board, and voila`. This is the first one I&#x27;ve had
with a working shortwave function, I could pick up WWV. I&#x27;ve tried shortwave
converters added to an AM radio in the past with no success.

 In the AM video it starts &quot;I am Hultay&quot;, in SW at 7 seconds it&#x27;s a scream,
don&#x27;t know what that is.
