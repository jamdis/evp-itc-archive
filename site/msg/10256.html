                Bingo Kay and William! The strength of your connection and the clarity
of your messages depends on the strength of the bond or bridge you
develop with your friends on the otherside. The equipment is only
needed to materialize the message. This is why you can use almost
anything as a medium to bring them across.

I love to see people learn on their own through their own reasoning.

Regards,

Frank R.
