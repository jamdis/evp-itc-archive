Wow. 

I have heard of Herkimer. I think it is in eastern part of upper New=
 York State. My sweet wife and I live in New York City, but we have a summe=
r home in Columbia County, New York, about 3.5 hours from NYC. It is about =
30 miles southeast of Albany, the state Capital, and 7 miles from the Mass.=
 state line. You don't think of rural, or most folks don't when you think o=
f New York, but our house upstate is in such a rural area and is off of a d=
irt road. We can't even get cable or city water we are so far up in the boo=
nies. LOL.

Thanks for the info Kay. I will check into it.

Many Blessings =
All,

Jeremy
