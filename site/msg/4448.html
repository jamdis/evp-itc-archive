<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This file was recorded during a rs 470 session today.
the spirit that was communicating actually burps and then says &#x27;pardon
me please&#x27; the file is longer
and you can tell that it was not me that burped because it occurs on
top of me saying the word frequency.

I believe the entity had traveled through the box and was in the same
room with me when this occured.
I have a theory that when a box is in use it opens not only a line of
live communication but also a portal that spirits can use to
travel back and forth during a session.

that is the reason at the end of each session I ask that any spirits
that may have come through while the box was on
please go back or you will be stuck here until the next session. I
always get conformation from my techs that any and all are back.

listen to the file and let me know what you think
