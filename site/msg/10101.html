<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I can&#x27;t explain that either, sometimes i click on a file from a month 
ago and it say&#x27;s something completely different than what i posted.  
Either they are changing how the files sound or we hear differently 
on certain days.  Now let&#x27;s factor in everyone else that hears 
different than we do, i don&#x27;t think we will all agree on one file 
saying the same thing.  I do hear things with my headphones that i do 
not hear on my regular pc speakers.

&gt;   Ha its funny how different it sounds to everyone. Do you think it 
has anything to do with the computer and the way they are listening 
to the clip. I listened to one of your clips on two different 
computers one with ear buds in mono and the other with stereo 
headphones and heard two completely different things not even close 
to each other. Also does the sound card and player your using make a 
difference.
&gt; 
&gt;   Just a thought
