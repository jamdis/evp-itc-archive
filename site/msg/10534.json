Just the parts for mine are more than $25 bucks, and the \n&gt; hack is almost as good, it does the job. \n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe, if I quit going off on tangents, and just get some boards \n&gt; professionally done....\n&gt; \n&gt; I did have a couple boards made last fall for the LA1816, but the \n&gt; radio turned out to be just c-r-a-p-p-eee, I just set them aside. \n&gt; One all the wiring is done, and one is just the bare board. They \nare \n&gt; mostly SMT components. If there are some real techno-gurus out \n&gt; there, I don&#39;t have a problem giving these boards away. The AM \nband \n&gt; works, but it&#39;s kinda noisy, which could be just the wrong choice \nof \n&gt; IF cans, or maybe the RF amp. These are second gen boards for the \n&gt; LA1816, the first one I had the pin spacing too close for the \nradio \n&gt; chip. They have RVG, and linear, which also may contribute to \nnoise. \n&gt; Randy Schnieder has one of these, that was 25, now I can&#39;t \nremember \n&gt; what I did with 26, the ones I have on hand would be 28, and as \nyet \n&gt; an unassigned number.

Hell I could only wish to \n&gt; have one myself, but I know that their is not enough to go around, \n&gt; and also know that I probably will never be able to get one. So \nI&#39;m \n&gt; content to have my Radio Shack Hack, without the ego problem. \n&gt; That&#39;s fine with me, I feel great about being a member of this \n&gt; group, and making some friends. Maybe some day I might be able to \n&gt; use what I learn from y&#39;all to build something for myself. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Later Guys, and have a great day\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; William Rees \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi All; We have been warned by others from time to time \n&gt; about unbridled box use, as it supposedly brings in negativity. I \n&gt; don&#39;t want to believe that, but there are a few cases of people \n&gt; using boxes made by me, as well as the hack radios, and going \nwhacko \n&gt; big time. Its&#39; either all ego--I&#39;m the onlyest one that can use \n&gt; this, or like the more recent example. I don&#39;t know if these \npeople \n&gt; were like this to start, or if it&#39;s an external influance, but \nit&#39;s \n&gt; discouraging. There seems to be a similar reaction with systems \nnot \n&gt; made by me--so I&#39;ve been told.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Soooo, maybe burn some white candles, and maybe get a Rosary. My \n&gt; guys talk about the Catholics, and the Purple Princess has a \n&gt; Catholic connection on the etheric levels, although the church \n&gt; imposes too many limits on her. I wouldn&#39;t want to go into a state \n&gt; of fear, but a little protection stuff couldn&#39;t hurt. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Not only do I not have the time to mass produce boxes, I&#39;m \n&gt; beginning to think it&#39;s not a good idea anyway. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Express yourself wherever you are.
