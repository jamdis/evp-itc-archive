<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ron,

I was speaking to Juli Velazquez Last night and she reminded me that 
when she got started with the RS box she had horrible reception. She 
had come up with the idea of running the RS 469 through a telivision 
set via audio cables with the red and white conectors at one end and a 
3.5 mm jack at the other.

just plug the red and whote plugs into the corresponding audio in or 
video in ports on your tv. switch the tv to video as if you where using 
a dvd player or video game console and turn on the RS box.

This will run the RS signal through the tv, Juli has had better 
reception using this method. Give it a try and let us know how it goes.
