<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I shipped Andy an ITC probe 3 years ago to modify for me, after he agreed to do it.

I&#x27;m still waiting for it back.  I already figured that he stole it and i&#x27;m out $80.  You probably saw mine the other day that he took from me!

I made my own version last year after a friend figured out what andy did for the modification.  Been using it for a year and haven&#x27;t heard anything yet.

I had high hopes for this, but i fear it is just another hoax.  Check and see if it has worked for anybody else but Andy, then maybe i will re-consider that he isn&#x27;t faking his results.

&gt; I&#x27;ve just finished two days at the American Ghost Society conference where I was blown away by a presentation by April Slaughter on Andy Coppock&#x27;s ITC Probe.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you guys know about this?
&gt; 
&gt; She played a good portion of an eleven minute interactive, full sentence conversation that she had with her grandfather who died seven years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; Unless this is a hoax, which I would hope that an MIT graduate and biomedical engineer wouldn&#x27;t be part of, this is extraordinary.
&gt; 
&gt; We heard full sentences in the same voice throughout. The words were understandable with intonation coming through.
&gt; 
&gt; I was utterly blown away.  
&gt; 
&gt; Coppock is doing a controlled study with it, using other scientists and a few ghost hunters.
