I wonder in \nthis case if whoever or whatever is producing the sounds in the boxes can \nactually get some of your body&#39;s energy to use?\n\nZack (W9SZ)\n\nOn Thu, 28 Feb 2008, dead.science wrote:\n\n&gt; I get very very tired from my sessions. I try to keep them to 10 min.\n&gt; because of this.  Please remember I run marathons and have been a ham\n&gt; for over 20 years so I can listen to the radio for hours on end.  I am\n&gt; not certain why this is happening. Just wondering if anybody has this\n&gt; problem.\n&gt; Rob.\n&gt;"}
