But, I guess it&#39;s still EVP in a sense.  It&#39;s just a sub-\nset of EVP I guess you could say.  So, &quot;Disembodied Voices \nExperiment&quot; would be another way of putting it, you&#39;re right... I \nguess the EVP tag is fixed to the older method of recording on tape \nor digital media of voices heard through white noise or just in the \nair... or imprinted on tape or other media.\n\nYumm... Sunday dinner.. what time do we eat ?  :-)\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;eastern_paranormal&quot; \n&lt;eparanormal@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike,\n&gt; \n&gt; You didn&#39;t state in the video what the software you were using for \n&gt; your EVP experiment. What was it? Also since you were using the the \n&gt; hacks wouldn&#39;t it be more real time communication verses EVP? Maybe \n&gt; something along the lines of &quot;Disembodied Voices Experiment.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Just my rambling thoughts while cooking Sunday dinner :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Gabreael\n&gt; www.easternparanormal.com \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For those who care to see... I&#39;ve posted a quick 4 minute video \n&gt; tour of \n&gt; &gt; the EVP and ITC systems I use, with a quick explanation of their \n&gt; setup.\n&gt; &gt; The video is at:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyQKmBXY1ig\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks...\n&gt; &gt; and have a super-natural paranormal day!\n&gt; &gt; - Mike Coletta\n&gt; &gt; http://www.ufomagazine.net\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
