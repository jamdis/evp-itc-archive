Thanks Margaret! 
 
 As far saving all the voices and recordings, I used t=
o, but decided it was pointless. Who's going to ever go back and want to li=
sten to the average EVP recording? It's not like it's really needed for evi=
dence, or anything. I save the outstanding stuff, and dump the rest. Beside=
s, it's almost like the tapes get changed, as I can grab just about any old=
 recording, and there's voices talking about current events, so it's useles=
s as an archive. Besides, your perceptions change over time, and what you t=
hought you heard may not be there later, or may say something entirely diff=
erent.
