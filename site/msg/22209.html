<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Too cumbersom! But I did make a couple boxes with tone generators to mix a
tone in with the tuner auido. The idea being to provide a foundation tone
which might help &quot;them&quot; make their voices. It seems to help, but I don&#x27;t
keep the boxes long enough to really test it.

 Spiricom used 13 tones, supposedly the 13 fundamental frequencies that
make up human speech.  I used a square wave tone generator, vary simple,
and rich in harmics, so hoping  mutiple tones generators not needed. One
box was $4, the next one was 111, I think. I had a couple with 8 tones, but
was too cumbersom.
