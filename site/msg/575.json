If you use a digital recorder, you don&#39;t always need background noise to generate the EVPs. It depends on if you&#39;re doing an inside investigation or an outside invetigation. Outside, there&#39;s enough noise generated naturally. Inside, my team has found the more active WE are, the more active THEY are. We are trying to figure out if the energy they use is AC or DC generated, or what frequency they are on as well. The act of them imprinting voices is the 1st step in finding out what scientific measures they use to doso. \n  We know they do it, the HOW is what we&#39;re trying to find out at this point. \n  We&#39;re currently testing different set ups in the field. \n  We had a live feed mic running thru a mixer hooked up to the laptop running Acid Pro. When there was an active wave on the read out, we&#39;d stop it, listen, and then respond to them immediately. It was as close to a &quot;real time&quot; conversation as we could get.\n  We also had our normal digital voice recorders active, as well as one recorder set up in an insulated box. The purpose for this was to see if it&#39;s the background noise they use to imprint the EVPs, or if they use the EM waves to imprint them. We are in process of analyzing the material. It was a 9 hour overnight investigation. Normally, it takes 3 hrs per every hour recorded to analyze. We had a live mic feed, and 3 digital records - 2 out, 1 in the box. So you can imagine how much time it&#39;s going to take us to get thru all of the material.\n  Your best bet is to forgo the whole whitenoise deal, and just have a radio playing in the background at a low level. The reason for this, is that they will use the voices and music from the radio to produce what they want to say. Our speech has been transformed at certain points as well. Someone on the team will say something, and then on theplayback, it&#39;s completely different and set into an EVP.\n  Hope this helps,\n  Chris :)\n\nJaime Machado &lt;xtal32768@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hi Misty,\n\nThank you for the reply and the advices!

I use a natural white noise when I record \n&gt; and get good results. The water from the fishtank is pumped thru a \n&gt; charcoal filter creating a waterfall effect and the running water \n&gt; has always been a benefit to my sessions.\n&gt;\n&gt; However when using background sounds like water or music I \n&gt; usually find its best to not blast the sound and to turn the \n&gt; recording mic down halfway 50% loudness so it doesnt drown out the \n&gt; voices. I also find that most of the material is located within the \n&gt; recording at a much slower speed. For mine the more audible voices \n&gt; are usually located at -74 percent slowed (if using audacity to \n&gt; slow it) and sometimes at -30 when they have alot to get across.\n&gt;\n&gt; So try adjusting the sound volume and the recording mic volume \n&gt; and see if that helps.
