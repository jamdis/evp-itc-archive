Such as accent, dialect and \ngeneral pronunciation.\n\n\n\nThe current speech to text software available today could not learn \nfrom or accomodate training from basic allophones tones.\n\nIt must be taught to recognize Particular human speech patterns.\n\n\n\nI had trained the speech to text program extensively and had hoped it \nwould be able to use the spirit words formed from the radio\n\nfragments coming from a box, because they where based and \nmanufactured by fragments of human speech.\n\nBut to no avail. the program would only accept my personal voice \npattern and even then needed to be retrained periodically.\n\n\n\nThese programs where basically designed for stenographic purposes and \nto be used by secretaries and stenographers.\n\nI experimented for months with this idea and never received one \nspirit message in text.\n\n\n\nBruce"}
