If you are new to this and want \nsome \n&gt; help getting started please e-mail me and I will gladly explain how \nto \n&gt; get successful evp.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;\n Hello, first off you need to know that I am not new to evp&#39;s. I have \nbeen low budget recording for at least 4 years and involved with the \nparanormal for over 30 years. I use a cheap olympus digital recorder \nand am very careful about the conditions i record. There was no &quot; pipe \nbanging&quot; and I wasnt anywhere near a telephone All my evp&#39;s are &quot; \nreal&quot;. Just because you cant ( or wont) hear them doesnt mean that \nthey are &quot;shuffling or natural noise&quot;. I can hear them and other \npeople can hear them and that is enough for me. As i said i have been \ninvolved with the paranormal for many years and this has been a \nproblem. If you cant hear what I hear or see what I see doesnt mean \nthat im and idiot or faker."}
