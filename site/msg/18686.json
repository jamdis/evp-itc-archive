Just step by step,\nfirst figure out how to turn it on, and determine what each wire does that\ncomes from the processor board, and voila`. This is the first one I&#39;ve had\nwith a working shortwave function, I could pick up WWV. I&#39;ve tried shortwave\nconverters added to an AM radio in the past with no success.\n\n In the AM video it starts &quot;I am Hultay&quot;, in SW at 7 seconds it&#39;s a scream,\ndon&#39;t know what that is.\n\n F-S\n\nGo his adio om Hul ay some ime ago and an ac oss i las nigh , I didn' hink I could I make i wo k, he on panel is missing, I hink i go los in ou mo e, so I don' know wha b and i is.
