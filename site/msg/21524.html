Well.. I for one, don't post because I have nothing valuable to contribute.=
=C2=A0 I am very interested in
communication from the spirit world. And rea=
d all the posts with interest;=C2=A0But I work full time and don't 
have th=
e time to spend right now in learning and developing my interest. Maybe som=
eday I'll be able to
retire and be able to devote more time. But=C2=A0I=C2=
=A0 also know once I got started , I would become=C2=A0too engrossed and
pr=
obably neglect other areas of my life. This Forum is one way for me to keep=
 the door open, when I'm ready.
