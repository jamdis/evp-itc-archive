Great interview and its \nalways nice to hear Frank S speak about his own story rather than have \nothers make it up as they go. \n\nYou ALL did great!\n\nFor those who missed it you can find the show link on Chris&#39; page and \ndownload it for the replay.\n\nhttp://www.blogtalkradio.com/HauntedTimesMagazine/\n\n\nMisty"}
