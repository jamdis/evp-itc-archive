Since the tapping was continual\n              and you noticed an EM spik=\r\ne there is another possibility.\n\n              You could have detected a PK=\r\n event. In poltergeist cases we have come\n              to realize that liv=\r\ning PK agents often are responsible. These agents\n              function in=\r\n environments with specific characteristics and themselves\n              ex=\r\nhibit specific traits. One of the environmental characteristics is\n        =\r\n      an elevated magnetic field. Often this is a geomagnetic field as seem=\r\ns\n              to be the case in extreme poltergeist cases. Less extremem =\r\ncases, \n              such as this may be, we often see elevated EM field l=\r\nevels. Do your\n              readings in your notes? Were you reading elect=\r\nrical or magnetic\n              fields? What type of EMF meter were you usi=\r\nng? This might help\n              determine if the info you noticed was pot=\r\nentially related to PK\n              effects.\n\n              --- In EVP-ITC=\r\n@yahoogroups .com, &quot;April Abercrombie&quot; &lt;april@...&gt; wrote:\n              &gt;\n =\r\n             &gt; Let&#39;s try it again.\n              &gt;\n\n\n\n       \n\n\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_0033_01C9DF85.B5C74670\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18702&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 =\r\nface=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;When know it was not any of&nbsp;the \nheat/cooling syst=\r\nems, those were all in the kitchen area, and that is not where \nthe sound w=\r\nas coming from.

We \n            were reading EMF, so a bit of both.=\r\n We had several types of meters \n            present. At one point, we had =\r\n2 KII meters a few feet apart in the \n            living room. On&nbsp;some=\r\n taps, one would go off, and others, the \n            other one would go of=\r\nf. Most spikes fell in the 2.5 mg range, but a \n            couple went off=\r\n the scale.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;I=\r\nt also explains some of the \n            other activity the homeowners comp=\r\nlained about-the touch lamp, \n            kitchen lights dimming, etc.&lt;/FON=\r\nT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;Again, these surg=\r\nes were \n            constant, though not uniform.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n           =\r\n &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;April&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nFONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;BL=\r\nOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(0,0,0) 2px solid&quot; dir=3Dltr&gt;\n           =\r\n   &lt;DIV \n              style=3D&quot;FONT-VARIANT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; F=\r\nONT-FAMILY: arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; font-size-adjust: =\r\nnone&quot;&gt;----- \n              Original Message ----- &lt;/DIV&gt;\n              &lt;DIV=\r\n \n              style=3D&quot;FONT-VARIANT: normal; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAM=\r\nILY: arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; font-size-adjust: none&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nB&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; \n              &lt;A title=3Dphenom_investigator@... \n      =\r\n        href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dphenom_investigator@...&quot; rel=3Dnofol=\r\nlow \n              target=3D_blank \n              ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:phenom_=\r\ninvestigator@...&quot;&gt;phenom_investigator&lt;/A&gt; \n              &lt;/DIV&gt;\n     =\r\n         &lt;DIV \n              style=3D&quot;FONT-VARIANT: normal; FONT-STYLE: nor=\r\nmal; FONT-FAMILY: arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; font-size-ad=\r\njust: none&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; \n              &lt;A title=3DEVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n =\r\n             href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3DEVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofoll=\r\now \n              target=3D_blank \n              ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC@=\r\nyahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups \n              .com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n       =\r\n       &lt;DIV \n              style=3D&quot;FONT-VARIANT: normal; FONT-STYLE: norma=\r\nl; FONT-FAMILY: arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; font-size-adju=\r\nst: none&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; \n              Thursday, May 28, 2009 10:04 AM&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n              &lt;DIV \n              style=3D&quot;FONT-VARIANT: normal; FONT-STYL=\r\nE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; font-s=\r\nize-adjust: none&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; \n              [EVP-ITC] Re: Tap sound&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n              &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n              &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n      =\r\n        &lt;P&gt;What I have been hearing on this since the first posting is a \n =\r\n             single&lt;BR&gt;tap that sounds like wood on wood. Since the tapping=\r\n was \n              continual&lt;BR&gt;and you noticed an EM spike there is anoth=\r\ner \n              possibility.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You could have detected a PK event. I=\r\nn \n              poltergeist cases we have come&lt;BR&gt;to realize that living P=\r\nK agents \n              often are responsible. These agents&lt;BR&gt;function in =\r\nenvironments \n              with specific characteristics and themselves&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;exhibit specific \n              traits. One of the environmental character=\r\nistics is&lt;BR&gt;an elevated \n              magnetic field. Often this is a geo=\r\nmagnetic field as seems&lt;BR&gt;to \n              be the case in extreme polterg=\r\neist cases. Less extremem cases, \n              &lt;BR&gt;such as this may be, we=\r\n often see elevated EM field levels. Do \n              your&lt;BR&gt;readings in =\r\nyour notes? Were you reading electrical or \n              magnetic&lt;BR&gt;field=\r\ns? What type of EMF meter were you using? This \n              might help&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;determine if the info you noticed was potentially \n              related t=\r\no PK&lt;BR&gt;effects.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A \n              href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3DE=\r\nVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow \n              target=3D_blank \n  =\r\n            ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroup=\r\ns \n              .com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;April Abercrombie&quot; &lt;april@...&gt; \n         =\r\n     wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Let&#39;s try it \n              again.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n            &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--End group email =\r\n--&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0033_01C9DF85.B5C74670--"}
