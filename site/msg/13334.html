<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Mary. For most things I just use the old pc microphone to record.

&gt; I have been following this site regularly and thanks for all the 
info. I was wondering Misty if you could tell me what you are using 
for your evps. Im in the market for a recorder and have been 
impressed with your evps. Thanks and keep up the good work.

&gt; Heres a few voices from my latest session recording water then 
slowing down -74% in audacity. For me they are quite loud and the 
clarity was great. I recorded these on a night of the full moon 
(which does seem to help).
&gt; 
&gt; Attaching a few of the clearer ones to this post and for those who 
dont get the dailies you can listen on my esnips site. For the other 
methods click on my profile there and you will see folders listed.
