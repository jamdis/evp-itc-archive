When my husband asked whether or not reincarnation is real, he was met wi=
th a slew of "no"'s. We know better than to believe anything they say one w=
ay or the other, but we do recognize that this is excellent proof of intell=
igent communication... how often do you scan the dial and get like five or =
six "no"'s this close together?

See "reincar-no" file in my folder "Adrian=
a's files" in the files section.
