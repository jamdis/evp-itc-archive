I figured it was them doing some creative editing when they got the film back.  I bookmarked your site...didnt reallize you were part of AA-EVP til I saw your story video on your website...then I realized I had listened to your EVPs before and they are a big reason I got i nterested in EVP research.  That website was my very first look into the world of EVP and other audio/video phenomenom...its very informative and still my top fave  I&#39;ll check your website in a bit for more pics and stuff.\n   \n  Thanks!\n  Rhonda\n\nmisujoey &lt;Debbie@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hi Rhonda...
