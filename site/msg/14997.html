<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Heehee - there was a mockingbird nest somewhere in the vicinity.
Mockingbirds, when nesting, sing 24 hours a day. This one was going all
night in true mockingbird fashion.

There wouldn&#x27;t have been any heating or cooling fans, night watchmen, sump
or plumbing system sounds as there were none where I was the other night.
Everything else plus the coyotes and car traffic came through on pocket
audio recorders. Plus the speedway a couple miles down the road between
about 7:30 and 10:30 pm. THAT was the worst! VRROOOM!  VRROOOM!

&gt;   You potentially could have heard lots of things.
&gt;
&gt; Some that come to mind are cats, mice, structural shifts, weather, birds
&gt; outside, heating or cooling fans, curious insects, a night watchman, sump or
&gt; plumbing systems ... the possibilities are endless.

&gt;   I am curious if anyone with a microphone wired to a remote site has ever
&gt; gotten any EVP in real time.
&gt;
&gt; I took part in an investigation of Ashmore Estates, near Ashmore IL, on
&gt; Saturday night. We had six video cameras set up in the three halls of the
&gt; building. The video for all was being monitored and recorded at a central
&gt; location. Alas, we did not have microphones at the camera sites conected to
&gt; the central location. I wonder what we might have heard if we did?
