I have what you describe happen often, as \nwell as voices that seem perfectly clear, yet no one else can hear \nthem. it&#39;s confusing!\n\n Frank-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, rednellie &lt;rednellie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Now that I&#39;ve been at this for a week, I&#39;ve got a ton of questions \n&gt; (well, OK, maybe 5 or 6).  I&#39;ll try to check the archives to make \nsure \n&gt; these haven&#39;t already been discussed to death before I ask.  Also, \nis \n&gt; there a FAQ I could look at?  OTOH, it may be helpful to have basic \n&gt; questions revisited from time to time in case anyone has come up \nwith \n&gt; new ideas about them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, first question -  I&#39;ve had a couple of instances where I \nheard a \n&gt; response loud and clear at the time, but on playback, the words are \n&gt; actually quite faint.  Is there a technological reason for that?  I \nhave \n&gt; a decent degree of psychic ability and am working with a spirit \nwhom \n&gt; I&#39;ve been communicating with telepathically for over a year.  Is is \nmore \n&gt; likely that I am picking up on the answer psychically as well, \nwhich \n&gt; amps up how I perceive it at the time?  And would his communicating \nwith \n&gt; me psychically divert some of his energy from the ghost box \n&gt; communication, which would also explain why it came through fainter \non that?\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t want to exhaust you with a bunch of questions all at once, \nso \n&gt; I&#39;ll save the rest for later.  You&#39;d start to feel like you&#39;re \ndealing \n&gt; wit a 5 year old - &quot;Why, why, why, why, why?!!!&quot;  =)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nellie\n&gt;"}
