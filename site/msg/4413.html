<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I would think it&#x27;s pretty difficult not to talk about what some of 
the messages say. The whoel point of EVP is life goes on. Even if the 
planet gets physically obliterated, you still go on, just up a few 
steps. To much tech talk gets boring after a whuile.

&gt; Thanks for the return.  I suppose this forum could take a turn away 
from the tech side if we really got into analysis of all messages.  
Yet, I can&#x27;t NOT think about meaning...if you know what I mean.  
Particularly when it comes the major earth change stuff that can 
affect my kids.  If not appropriate for this group please send me 
direct email on any EVP that might suggest any pre-warning signs we 
might look for before the big bang.  As an aside, let me say that I 
have been with and am currently with other groups discussing such 
issues but I am quickly putting great value in what is being shared 
here.  I like the direct approach rather than the he-said-she-said 
theorizing.   Thanks again Frank.

ask questions, not even with EVPmaker, but there 
&gt; seems to be coded dates that point to 2012. They alwaya talk about 
&gt; Christmas in connection with this stuff, and that I take as number 
&gt; 12, or 2012(?).

&gt; &gt; That is an amazing message there Frank...seems to fit with what 
&gt; many have been saying...including remote viewers like Ed and 
&gt; company. Can you get dates or more info? Or do you want to? Ron L

&gt; &gt; Here I use audio from an old school board meeting for the raw. 
&gt; It&#x27;s speech only.
