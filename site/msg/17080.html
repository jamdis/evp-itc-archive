Hi!
=C2=A0
It happens always at night and at different times during the day=
. Rain, shine, snow does not matter. Today the diningroom lights were turni=
ng off and on, we have new electrical and did all of those checks necessary=
. 
=C2=A0
The pattern recently is this: We go to bed . We may or may not se=
e a dark shadow move in the bedroom. Within 10 minutes the banging begins. =
It sounded last night as if things were being thrown on the floor on my sid=
e of the bed. Nothing had fallen. Then it moves all around the room hitting=
 the mirrorred door, the tv, the next wall, then Jay's bedside table and en=
ds with the window above our heads. A full circle. We told it to go. It got=
 quiet for 4 hours. Usually it just continues and gets louder. It also seem=
s to like banging the door and all 4 walls of the closet. I have been sleep=
ing with a fan on to drown it out and as a result it has gotten much louder=
. 
=C2=A0
HAha as I type this it is banging behind my head on the china cab=
inet. When I came downstairs early this a.m. it banged 3 walls, in successi=
on, as loudly as it could not 2 feet behind me. It is now banging on the ca=
se of my PC, my monitor, the dinigroom table and the ceiling...brother, it =
never gives up.=C2=A0 It walks up and down the stairs, scars the bejeezuz o=
utta our 14 yr old cat, bangs the front door, the porch ceiling and walks o=
verhead in the attic over the 2nd floor bedroom. 
=C2=A0
We know the other =
spirits who reside with us, this one we don't. Oh yes, sometimes we get a v=
ery foul odor associated with it. ( heavy testosterone/ chicken soup/ dirty=
 sweatsocks smells) Other times we smell heavy Old Spice over our faces in =
the bed.
=C2=A0
It also seems to thrive on negativity. We work very hard to=
 contain that in our home, the negativity I mean. If Jay & I have an argume=
nt it REALLY gets active. Makes us wonder if moving is the solution.
=C2=A0=

BTW, we have so many EVP's it isn't funny. One of my deceased son, Jay's D=
ad, and something very garbled. The one of my son is VERY clearly stating h=
is name. THAT was the best! 
=C2=A0
Keep the ideas and suggestions coming, =
please! 
=C2=A0
Thanks much! 
Annie & Jay C.
=C2=A0
I appreciate your respo=
nse. Where is MAPS located?
=C2=A0


Take every chance you get because some=
 things only happen once...

Hi annie,

We just joined thi=
s group, and I would like to say that with your problem, pay close attenion=
 to the times that this happens and the weather. you might have a residual =
huanting, if that is the case you wont get rid of it and it wont talk to yo=
u, because it wont know that you are there.. hope I am not repeating imform=
ation. ..Have a great day
