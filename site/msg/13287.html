<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think doing the ITC experiments themselves certainly wouldn&#x27;t be harmful
or produce a negative effect. Other than that, it might depend on what kind
of responses you get - whether they are positive or nevative.
In any case it certainly would not be the worst thing a young child could
experience. Parents having a fight in front of them would be far worse IMO.

&gt;   I was wondering if anyone had an opinion on the impact of performing
&gt; ITC experiments or sessions, when there are young children around. Do
&gt; you think the children seeing their parents or others (in person, not
&gt; on TV) engaging in this activity would have an effect on the children,
&gt; and if so, do you think the effect would be positive, or negative?
