<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks, but that&#x27;s the Rolling Hills Box, presumably out in public, I don&#x27;t
want it to sound like crapola. This board more better.

 I had some boardfs I made in advance, but don&#x27;t have cabinets for, this
one, and another with a car tuner.

&gt;   I wouldn&#x27;t worry about Frank all you did was tell him his stuff was
&gt; outdated which was true..I notice he left some images up there.
&gt;
&gt; I see what you mean &quot;noisy&quot; but its really not that bad..unless when he
&gt; tranfer on my end it gets a natural filter..so i can&#x27;t tell what it sounds
&gt; like in person

&gt;   Yeah, been told this. I get the impression there&#x27;s some joining this
&gt; group hoping to get their ghost huntng or spirit beliefs validated, or
&gt; confirmed, when they hear this junk they bail. This stuff is ITC,
&gt; Instrumental Trans-Communication. That can be audio, video, or still images.
&gt; I think there is a mis-conception in the paranormal whatever world that EVP
&gt; is ghost voice, weak whispery barely audible noise, and ITC is video
&gt; feedback loop images, an never shall the two ever, ever mix. Some seem to
&gt; think it&#x27;s all perfectly well defined and laid down in laws and protocols.
&gt; Afterall it&#x27;s repeated on TV week after weak after week.
&gt;
&gt;  I managed to completely offend the guy that told me about the embedded
&gt; images, Richard Roberts. He started laying down all these absolute
&gt; undeniabel laws and definitions of EVP, and when I disagreed openly, he got
&gt; all pissed off, deleted all his Facebook content, and went away, sulking in
&gt; some dark internet corner I guess. I feel bad about offending him, but come
&gt; on! Grow up out there.
&gt;
&gt;  Think I&#x27;ll replace the tuner in this box, too frikin&#x27; noisy. I don&#x27;t have
&gt; tuners to spare, but this one is unacceptabel.
