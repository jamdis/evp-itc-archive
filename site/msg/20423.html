<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks.  I build very slow, but always try to make something different.  This is another one of a kind sweep.

Seems there isn&#x27;t much interest in the boxes anymore though.  I make them and stick it in the corner to collect dust.  I put them on EBAY or offer it to the groups, but no response from either.

That&#x27;s why i don&#x27;t make many anymore, what am i going to do with all of these?

I get a lot of e-mails for a box, but it&#x27;s all the same thing and frank can attest to this to.

They want me to build them a box and ship it to them for FREE, usually because they are a TAPS family member or somebody halfway famous in the field.

I can&#x27;t do that anymore, i ran out of money and frank is retired.

&gt; I call this circuit a hybrid sweep.  It is a blend of random and linear modes together.  It sweeps in a linear fashion, but has a runaway speed change to it.  Let me know what you guys think of it.
