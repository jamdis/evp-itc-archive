Okay, here the part that I confess that I spoke with an entity who
claimed to be John Lennon back in the 1980s. Note, I say claimed. I
have no idea if it was him or not. With that as a caveat, perhaps
we&#x27;ve built up some kind of collective sympathetic vibration to Lennon
that draws him here. If it is him, that is delightfully cool. If not,
well, good mimic so far. I sounded like him to me.
