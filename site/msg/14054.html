You will never be able to prove your methods scientifically, so why even tr=
y to argue with them? Even if you were able to, they probably still wouldn'=
t believe it.

IMO, who cares? All that matters is that you are getting som=
ething out of it. Besides, maybe it isn't meant to be understood by certain=
 people. I have always held the opinion that we will never scientifically p=
rove anything we do in the paranormal field, and I think that is no acciden=
t. I think some people will never get anything out of it, while others will=
 excel in their knowledge, but it will be all very personal.

It's all abou=
t what constitutes enough proof for you personally. You have to go with you=
r gut on what is true spirit communication, and what isn't. If no one ever =
agrees with you, so what?

   I was just sayin'!  So why would anyone in this field c=

it? That's the thing, say anything and I'm the one being negative. Question=
 these other experts and I'm being negative--on and on. 

   Same old story=

 All the pompus self proclaimed egotisical little dweebs out there chasing =
the damn fame and fortune--not facts.

   I have gotten so much friggn' voi=
ces that can't be explained as anything but spirits/entity communication--n=
ot good enough! 

   You hear that crap(any proof...) from every scientist/=
debunker--well if the evidence was there we'd be the first to celibrate it-=
yeah right, rihgt after they burned, burried, and debunked it. There is mor=

   The stuff is simple-pro=

speak, no friggin' mystery, no magic, no secret tecnology, no high priest(e=
