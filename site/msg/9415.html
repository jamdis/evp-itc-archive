<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Kerry.  Welcome!  Frank doesn&#x27;t sell his boxes, but he has posted in the forum, some 
schematics if you would want to take on building one for yourself.  

Also, there are commercially available alternatives.  There is the MiniBox from 
www.paranormalsystems.com (priced $399-$449 depending if you want a crystal added to 
it or not).  Sometime in the near future, they will be launching the MaxiBox (a more 
advanced version of the MiniBox - which will remain in production for the average user.)

As well, the following Radio Shack models can be modified for continuous sweep by 
snipped the wire to the mute pin:

12-469 new or old version (new one has a click-click-clicking during sweep)
12-470 old version only (hard to come by)
12-820
20-125

And last, but certainly not least is, manually sweeping the radio (just move the tuner back 
and forth quickly so that only snippets are heard from each broadcasting station.)

Hope this info helps some.

Margaret

&gt; Hey group -
&gt; 
&gt; I joined last week and have enjoyed reading all the posts.  I started
&gt; a little paranormal group here in backwards Nebraska last year.
&gt; We conducted three investigations in 2007 at the Villisca Axe Murder
&gt; House -
&gt; http://www.villiscaiowa.com/
&gt; 
&gt; I will be happy to share the numerous EVP&#x27;s we captured from those
&gt; visits.  Has anyone investigated this place?
&gt; 
&gt; How and where can I purchase a Frank&#x27;s box?  Who can I contact?  Are
&gt; there different models?  THANKS for any input!
&gt; 
&gt; Kerry J.
