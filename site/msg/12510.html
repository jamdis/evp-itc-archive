<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Correct, and a lot of that appropriation happened during the several
different inquisitions (1100&#x27;s through 1600&#x27;s) where the Catholic
Church first sought to secure its dominance over other sects of
Christianity and then moved on to others over time.  That&#x27;s where you
have things like the King James Bible appear out of (during the later
part of that period), which pretty much replaced everything with
&quot;devil&quot; and &quot;demon&quot; (which one depends on which version of KJ you read).

And to clarify what I was stating (which is not how Don was taking it)
- in its Jewish origins it has nothing to do with temptation and
making us stronger.  I was not stating anything along those lines. 
Its purely neutral, and an agent of simple choice - i.e. it presents
both good and bad choices equally, i.e. if you have something bad
it&#x27;ll present something good and vice versa.  The idea kabbalistically
is that we were put here to develop and exercise free will.  You can&#x27;t
have free will if you don&#x27;t have choice, hence ha-satan.  I.E, you
can&#x27;t choose between Coke and Pepsi if there&#x27;s just Coke or there&#x27;s
just Pepsi.  The other has to be created and provide to provide
&quot;choice&quot;, and therefore enable you to express &quot;free will&quot;.  Nothing
negative about that.  The context of negativity is one that was laid
on during appropriation.

&gt; We already said that, but it was also stated that Satan is a made up  
&gt; character of the early Church to instill fear and use that fear to  
&gt; control the masses. It worked well for the Peruvians, so the early  
&gt; Church copied the idea - like they copied a lot of things. :) But this  
&gt; list  isn&#x27;t the place to get further into this topic, though it&#x27;s  
&gt; interesting.

&gt; &gt; This actually fits with Christian beliefs too.  Everywhere the word
&gt; &gt;  Satan is used, they are talking about an agent of God who&#x27;s purpose
&gt; &gt; is to tempt us and therefore to temper our spirits and make us
&gt; &gt; stronger.
