Thanks Zak, I understand now.  The seller had an excellent rating so I gues=
s I was just unfortunate.  I've never had a problem with Ebay before this i=
ncident either.  The repair place said they spent several days trying to cl=
ean it to no avail.

Re: [EVP-ITC] OT ? RE: Broken Cellphone



  Sorry to hear about the diffic=
ulty, Robin. What was the feedback rating of 
  the seller? I have never ha=
d problems with any eBay seller whose feedback 
  was 98% positive or bette=
r.

  Water (except for distilled water) contains mineral salts that are 
 =
 electrically conductive. When it dries it leaves behind these salts as 
  =
residues which are also conductive. You might be able to clean the phone 
 =
 if you get to it fast enough, but sometimes the conductivity of water puts=
 
  voltages on parts where it doesn't belong and ruins them. I'd guess the=
 
  phone is a goner.
  :-(
