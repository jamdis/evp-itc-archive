Last night I \n&gt;tried it for the first time using the FM radio sweep. The optical \n&gt;microphone uses an oil lamp flame and a phototransistor, a very simple \n&gt;design. I had asked for some names in this session. Here are two clips from \n&gt;the session.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Poncho and Cisco&quot;  I remember the TV show &#39;Cisco Kid&#39; from 50 plus years \n&gt;ago.\n&gt;&quot;Jorgesen liked a beer&quot; (or liked it here)\n&gt;\n&gt;Dave\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt;&lt;&lt; 040307planetweretesting.mp3 &gt;&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nNeed a break?
