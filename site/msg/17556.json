I am not sure what your\nhearing. Which file do you hear it in?\n\nIt is an auto sweep, so you hear the regular switching of the channels. This\nparticular device adds more white noise in the background, so maybe that is\nwhat you are hearing as well. It has more of shhhh sound per switch than a\nFrank&#39;s box or shack hack.\n\nOn Sun, Jun 6, 2010 at 6:43 PM, &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  sounds like chains rattling, what&#39;s making the heavy noise? sounds like\n&gt; banging something together, like metal objects\n&gt;\n&gt;  In a message dated 6/6/2010 6:40:12 P.M.

Unfortunatley\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will hear her say what she thinks she hears in the files. Please try\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be influenced by her. I will admit though that she seems to hear\n&gt; &gt; these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; things much better then I can.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though I am still not convinced, some of these are uncanny, and I was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; surprised. I will be conducting ongoing, regular experiments with this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Opinions are welcome.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; April\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;\n\nI 's jus he spi i box, my daugh e , and me.
