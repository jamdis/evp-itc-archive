Hi All;

I been sick as hell for ten days, and just starting to recover. One thing I 
rarely do is stop building boards long enough the use my own equipment for 
testing, and actually ask questions like this. I do have a Linear mode only 
system now, and almost have the Linear/RVG/Manual system in a box, I was 
able to work on it for several hours last night.
