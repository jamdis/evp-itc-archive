I have\nseen the images which are supposed to enhance abilities and while I\nnotice power, I can&#39;t utilize it. Anyways, I&#39;d be very happy to join\nyou in this, especially if its frequency is this beneficial.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Very cool YouTube video. \n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sonpvUxGL8 \n&gt; \n&gt; The patterns reminded me of Emoto&#39;s work with water, but this is\n&gt; sound.  Really interesting.  \n&gt; \n&gt; My hearing is very sensitive, so I don&#39;t know how much of, or for how\n&gt; long, the sounds I heard that I would be able to tolerate.  But I&#39;m\n&gt; going to go browse a little more or your web site.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Doc Stars &lt;docstarsrx008@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to introduce myself.. and share this information with the\n&gt; group here in the hopes that some members may have an interest in\n&gt; participating in an experimental research project.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Im looking for people who are willing to participate in our online\n&gt; experiment and can provide input, feedback and comparison on some of\n&gt; the various digital frequency files we are using.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After many years of researching, on going development and testing\n&gt; our current experimental group of approximately 2000 volunteers have\n&gt; been witness to some really unusual and intense phenomena playing\n&gt; out... bordering on the supra-normal. We&#39;re seeing rapid, profound\n&gt; effects on the body and mind occuring via this new acoustic frequency\n&gt; tool.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Specifically, one of the areas we are focusing on now and are hoping\n&gt; to collect more data on are the effects on the mind and body from the\n&gt; use of\n&gt; &gt; frequencies designed to entrain the body and mind towards those\n&gt; states conducive to the experience of ascension and the manifestation\n&gt; of desired positive change.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I recently released new &#39;frequency&#39; protoypes that our group has\n&gt; been testing and their reports of the results they have been\n&gt; experiencing have been staggering.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Implications currently, are for enormous  potential improvements for\n&gt; health and wellness as well as rapid change from challenging mind and\n&gt; emotional states to ones of increased vitality, increased performance\n&gt; and increased well being and balance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One possible and very real application of this may be to address\n&gt; both general and specific aspects of health issues.  For example one\n&gt; of our members experimented with effects on the blood , had an\n&gt; independent lab analyze his blood sample and it seems like there was a\n&gt; dramatic change in the bloods terrain!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Data collected to date on reaction responses have been over the top\n&gt; &gt; favourable.....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We are finding that actual &#39;things&#39; are happening, when these\n&gt; frequencies are simply played. Very noticeable and dramatic effects\n&gt; and changes in the body, mind and environment - unlike anything\n&gt; induced by any other sound (that we know of).  many people who\n&gt; experimented on these frequencies report that they are unlike other\n&gt; existing technologies such as binaural beats.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What we need right now however, are more volunteers who are willing\n&gt; to test out our other frequencies and keep a log of their findings and\n&gt; report their observations to our group. There is no cost required for\n&gt; testing frequencies, the primary benefit to my group and I is the\n&gt; collection of data.... the benefit to you, well... once you see what\n&gt; we are engaged in, I think you will be more than satisfied with the\n&gt; experience.....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Two things important here, one is to share with you the observations\n&gt; of our\n&gt; &gt; group in their process of discovery in relation to the health\n&gt; related frequency track - the thought being, that you are likely to\n&gt; not only find this intrinsically interesting and newsworthy but also\n&gt; inspiring. The second is to provide you with a means of facilitating\n&gt; your own journey through this phenomena in the hopes you can share\n&gt; your own unique findings with us.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Feel free to view a recent post on our research forum that details\n&gt; how to access this information and also various frequency tracks you\n&gt; can download.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/the_sound_of_stars/message/8216\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Examples of recent reports by users ;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; “I am struck with the effects that sound has on the physical\n&gt; structure. That is, especially in the subtle tissues like neurons and\n&gt; synapses. Case in point, I don&#39;t hesitate in expressing myself just\n&gt; the way it comes out. No coloring, no bravado, no bullshit....the\n&gt; endorphine level in the body went way up. I have noted from my initial\n&gt; listening of this freq. is that it appears to synchronize the 2\n&gt; hemispheres of the brain and thought became markedly coherent. ..\n&gt; perhaps the feeling of increased endorphine flow could be an actual\n&gt; increase in neuro- transmitter presence, particularly seratonin.... As\n&gt; things ended I was left with this feeling of balance and well being. I\n&gt; definitely want to work with this sequence more. It seems to be the\n&gt; right one for me currently. I probably want to post this explanation\n&gt; on the Yahoo site. I&#39;ll be sending my initial impressions in another\n&gt; email to you shortly. Thanks again for this amazing opportunity.”\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; “This morning I listened to kindle mind set, I have had family in\n&gt; and had not used the fequencies for a week. The first sensations were\n&gt; an extreme energy from my hands I am a Reiki Master but the energy and\n&gt; heat I felt was more than I had experienced before.There was a\n&gt; bubbling feeling inside my chest their was intense tingling of my\n&gt; chest and torso, a sensual, sexual feel.My arms legs and feet were\n&gt; extremely warm, I am usually cold. It felt like my blood was\n&gt; bubbling.I had an effervesce feeling in my mouth. My feet tingled and\n&gt; as I nwas laying on the chaise listening, I closed my eyes and was\n&gt; enjoying a full color animated video like p roduction without sound.\n&gt; This is first time I have seen anything other than a magenta colored\n&gt; flower.I listened to kindle set for about 3 hours. I have Bose\n&gt; speakers on the computer I used this morning.”\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
