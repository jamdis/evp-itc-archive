However, it needs\nsome practice to recognize them; one has to get used to the specific\nsound, rhythm and grammar of EVP. Perhaps it is better for newbies to\nstart with the basic recording techniques to learn hearing EVP and\ndistinguish between what real EVP could be, and what probably not, i.e.\nuse only recorder + microphone, and later then perhaps natural or\nartificial background sounds like water or radio as a &quot;raw material&quot;.\n\nAs to your EVPmaker recording, in the original file there aren&#39;t any\nbeeps. You should perhaps re-download the file:\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Stefan/SJ-Allophones.wav\nAnd also do use EVPmaker&#39;s Cue List option, since otherwise EVPmaker\ndoesn&#39;t play the individual allophones but only chopped fragments from\nthe file.\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Hi Stefan I used your file. I just checked the original you sent and\n&gt; there is a beep in the front which probably gets duplicated in EVP\n&gt; maker. Need to figure out a way to eliminate.\n   \n&gt; One question for you. Have you found newbees like me can do many\n&gt; sessions without results? I have done possibly 12 to 15 sessions.\n&gt; Ziltch! Nada! I trust the process but it ain&#39;t paying off yet. Gotta\n&gt; make something happen. I do appreciate your help. Ron L"}
