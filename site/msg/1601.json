Your response to my post to frank for a box was not\n&gt;begging but I believe that your obvious attempt at ass kissing is\n&gt;more insulting to frank than my asking for a box. it seems to me that\n&gt;you are afraid that I may get a box before you do and that for some\n&gt;reason you deserve one more than anyone else. I don&#39;t understand that\n&gt;being you already ripped off franks design and had some one build you\n&gt;a number of boxes on your own. As far as serious evp research goes I\n&gt;have dedicated many many hours, much more than you have I&#39;m sure to\n&gt;evp research and other forms of itc. matter of fact if anyone takes a\n&gt;look at your site the couple of dust orb pictures you have and the\n&gt;only evps I have heard are recent ones gleaned from the boxes you had\n&gt;made do not make you a dedicated seasoned pro at PI. I also remember\n&gt;not long ago you contacting me for advice and asking to join my team\n&gt;so in some way you must have recognised my professionalism. I will\n&gt;end by saying, If you want a box from frank be honest and ask like I\n&gt;did instead of trying to cuddle up next to him with your own version\n&gt;of his box and make it like you care about his feelings or protecting\n&gt;him from any annoyances. who made you the frank police anyway. steve\n&gt;just be real lets all work together and help each other do not try to\n&gt;sabotage anyone else hoping to further your own ambitions, you work\n&gt;with auto parts all day while I am doing evp research so you tell me\n&gt;who is more qualified to work with the box me or you?\n&gt;\n&gt;I hope I didn&#39;t piss anybody off this is just my opinion!\n&gt;\n&gt;bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nLocal listings, incredible imagery, and driving directions - all in one \nplace! http://maps.live.com/?wip=69&FORM=MGAC01\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
