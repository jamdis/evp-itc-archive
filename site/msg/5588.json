I \nhad a  \n&gt; really kick butt one that I sent to TAPs. A little girl, clear as \na  \n&gt; bell but there was nothing I could do with it. Hopefully TAPs can \ndo  \n&gt; something with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, the file I put up, if you listen REALLY  close when I ask a \n&gt; question there are tiny bell sounds right after the  question. I \nhave \n&gt; another almost 10 minute EVP where I left the recorder in  the \nroom, no \n&gt; windows or doors open and when I went in to turn it off there  was \na \n&gt; very strong scent of old fashioned tea rose.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone could  bump up the 2nd one to see what the low voices are \n&gt; saying that would be  great, drop me an e-mail. I am a sensitive \nbut \n&gt; would love to learn how to  also use some equiptment to help me out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you  \n&gt; \n&gt; Saqqara\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **************Start the year off right.
