Keiths methods differ from my own but I \nhave been recording with him for a couple years and am happy to see \nhe took his idea and made it a reality. \n\nHis project has had some great results for me personally and I \nthought I would share it with you all so you may partake of this and \nhelp to further the research. I have had both image and audio results \nwhich I have posted a few here:\n\nhttp://www.esnips.com/web/ITCBridge\n\nCheck those out first to get an idea of what I mean. \n\nAfter that heres some links to get you started for those who want to \njoin us and help make a difference. The first two (*) have chat \nenabled so you can chat with whoevers watching with you as well as \nKeith when he is on.
