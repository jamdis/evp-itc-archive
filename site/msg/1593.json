I am sure that all s=\r\nerious evp \nresearchers do recording sessions in their homes more than anyw=\r\nhere \nelse such as on a field investigation. If your like me you do a \nreco=\r\nrding just about everyday. In my experience there are many \ndifferent types=\r\n of evp researchers you have your die hard white noise \nusers, your silent =\r\nno question no background noise individuals your \nonly on investigations or=\r\n in ascertain room of the house people and \nthe radicals that reach out for=\r\n new methods and ideas and are always \nexperimenting with different ways to=\r\n record evp and dedicating a lot \nof brain power to try and come up with a =\r\nway to make the break \nthrough to real time communication as apposed to rec=\r\nording a question \nand answer session to be analyzed later.\nThen you have t=\r\nhe researchers like me that embrace with an open mind \nall forms of evp as =\r\nwell as itc and any other form of paranormal \nresearch and investigation, s=\r\nee I am the type of PI that will try new \nmethods and post them to a forum =\r\nor on my website so that others may \nsee what I am working on and maybe giv=\r\ne it a try themselves and \nhopefully further the method and the knowledge o=\r\nf it. Only to come \nunder fire from the so called sceptics that believe the=\r\ny must at any \ncost negatively view any presented outcome to give themselve=\r\ns \ncredibility. \nAnyway this is turning into a rant and getting away from t=\r\nhe subject. \nMany evp researchers if not all that I see and read and have c=\r\nontact \nwith are under the assumption that, and don&#39;t get me wrong they may=\r\n \nbe 100% correct that all evp are formed the same way with the spirit \nusi=\r\nng whatever form of ambient energy is available to form a message \nwhether =\r\nit be artificially supplied by the researcher or natural such \nas emf energ=\r\ny.\nI do subscribe to this theory that spirits do need some sort of \nenergy =\r\nto form words and place them onto our recording medium, that \nis not my dis=\r\npute.\nI also believe that the majority of researchers believe an evp is an =\r\n\nevp and the only valid evp is the one that can be heard loudly and \nclearl=\r\ny from the raw recording, I do not believe in this ideology. I \nbelieve the=\r\nre are two distinct and different ways we receive evp one \nfrom the physica=\r\nl plane and one from the spiritual plane. I believe \nthat the only way to r=\r\neceive what has been classified as a class A \nevp is from an earthbound or =\r\ngrounded spirit that is actually \nhaunting a location and is capable of uti=\r\nlizing the energy in the \nlocation much more efficiently for the reason tha=\r\nt the spirit is \namong the investigator and can take advantage of the close=\r\n proximity \nto the recording device and feed off of the physical and ambien=\r\nt \nenergy supplied by the individual or individuals in the recording \narea.=\r\n I also suspect that at times if we are lucky enough to be doing \na recordi=\r\nng at the right time we can record a class A evp from a \nspirit that is not=\r\n grounded but in visitation at that time.\nBut the class A & B++ evps must b=\r\ne obtained from a spirit that is \noccupying the same area as the recording =\r\ndevice.\nthe second type of evp is the spiritual plane evp, messages recorde=\r\nd \nfrom spirits that have crossed over and are in the spiritual world, I \nb=\r\nelieve they are still capable of sending evp messages from the \nspirit worl=\r\nd only they must also use the ambient energy surrounding \nthe recorder or c=\r\nompile it and place it onto the recorder. In other \nwords a much harder and=\r\n less effective method for the spirit leaving \nthe message. Therefore the m=\r\nessages we receive in this manner are \noften weak quiet and a bit distorted=\r\n but they are there.\nIf we take the time to look for them and clean them up=\r\n most of them \nare understandable also the majority of these messages tend =\r\nto be of \na personal nature most likely from friends or loved ones that hav=\r\ne \ncrossed. The only thing that stops these messages from being \ndiscovered=\r\n is that almost all the paranormal community subscribes to \nthe idea that t=\r\nhe only valid evp is the class A evp that does not \nneed to be cleaned or e=\r\nnhanced in any way.\nThere are many evp researchers out there I&#39;m sure that =\r\nhave started \nand adhered to the method of evp capture that they first lear=\r\nned \nabout in a book or on the Internet and have not for lack of \ninformati=\r\non or the opportunity to learn how to edit a recording using \nan audio edit=\r\ning program stuck to the strict set of recording \ntechniques that are mostl=\r\ny explained on the net in one form or \nanother. And I also believe that the=\r\ny witness the systematic \nslaughter of anyone who dares to post or mention =\r\nany new or radical \nidea or form of evp capture so they shy away from takin=\r\ng the leap and \ntrying some new or seldom recognized method and stick to th=\r\ne &quot;OLD&quot; \nand most widely accepted method out of fear of being ostracised \na=\r\nmo9ng their paranormal peers and I do mean peers , No one in this \nfield is=\r\n any better than the next person there are only PI&#39;s with \nmore experience =\r\nand ones with less but some with the more experience \ngo through the motion=\r\ns of investigation with blinders on following an \nantiquated set of investi=\r\ngatory and research rules and not opening \ntheir minds to anything else.\nMy=\r\n theory of the two different types of evp is formed from my \npersonal exper=\r\nience with different methods of recording and capture \nand I have evps that=\r\n are very personal in nature mentioning my name \nas well as subject matter =\r\nunique to me and my family that would have \nbeen totally over looked if not=\r\n for a good editing session.\nNO one can make me believe especially the so c=\r\nalled seasoned veterans \nthat an evp that mentions my name and that of frie=\r\nnds and or loved \nones can be randomly put together from editing filters be=\r\ning used on \nraw static.\nWell those are my thought on evp please do not hes=\r\nitate to let me \nknow what you think of this theory.\nBruce halliday\n\n \n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0010_01C7C6D7.E5BF0D40\r\nContent-Type:

I am sure that all serious evp &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nresearchers do recording sessions in their homes more than anywhere &lt;br&gt;\nel=\r\nse such as on a field investigation. If your like me you do a &lt;br&gt;\nrecordin=\r\ng just about everyday. In my experience there are many &lt;br&gt;\ndifferent types=\r\n of evp researchers you have your die hard white noise &lt;br&gt;\nusers, your sil=\r\nent no question no background noise individuals your &lt;br&gt;\nonly on investiga=\r\ntions or in ascertain room of the house people and &lt;br&gt;\nthe radicals that r=\r\neach out for new methods and ideas and are always &lt;br&gt;\nexperimenting with d=\r\nifferent ways to record evp and dedicating a lot &lt;br&gt;\nof brain power to try=\r\n and come up with a way to make the break &lt;br&gt;\nthrough to real time communi=\r\ncation as apposed to recording a question &lt;br&gt;\nand answer session to be ana=\r\nlyzed later.&lt;br&gt;\nThen you have the researchers like me that embrace with an=\r\n open mind &lt;br&gt;\nall forms of evp as well as itc and any other form of paran=\r\normal &lt;br&gt;\nresearch and investigation, see I am the type of PI that will tr=\r\ny new &lt;br&gt;\nmethods and post them to a forum or on my website so that others=\r\n may &lt;br&gt;\nsee what I am working on and maybe give it a try themselves and &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nhopefully further the method and the knowledge of it. Only to come &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nunder fire from the so called sceptics that believe they must at any &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\ncost negatively view any presented outcome to give themselves &lt;br&gt;\ncredibil=\r\nity. &lt;br&gt;\nAnyway this is turning into a rant and getting away from the subj=\r\nect. &lt;br&gt;\nMany evp researchers if not all that I see and read and have cont=\r\nact &lt;br&gt;\nwith are under the assumption that, and don&#39;t get me wrong they ma=\r\ny &lt;br&gt;\nbe 100% correct that all evp are formed the same way with the spirit=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\nusing whatever form of ambient energy is available to form a message =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nwhether it be artificially supplied by the researcher or natural such =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nas emf energy.&lt;br&gt;\nI do subscribe to this theory that spirits do need =\r\nsome sort of &lt;br&gt;\nenergy to form words and place them onto our recording me=\r\ndium, that &lt;br&gt;\nis not my dispute.&lt;br&gt;\nI also believe that the majority of =\r\nresearchers believe an evp is an &lt;br&gt;\nevp and the only valid evp is the one=\r\n that can be heard loudly and &lt;br&gt;\nclearly from the raw recording, I do not=\r\n believe in this ideology. I &lt;br&gt;\nbelieve there are two distinct and differ=\r\nent ways we receive evp one &lt;br&gt;\nfrom the physical plane and one from the s=\r\npiritual plane. I believe &lt;br&gt;\nthat the only way to receive what has been c=\r\nlassified as a class A &lt;br&gt;\nevp is from an earthbound or grounded spirit th=\r\nat is actually &lt;br&gt;\nhaunting a location and is capable of utilizing the ene=\r\nrgy in the &lt;br&gt;\nlocation much more efficiently for the reason that the spir=\r\nit is &lt;br&gt;\namong the investigator and can take advantage of the close proxi=\r\nmity &lt;br&gt;\nto the recording device and feed off of the physical and ambient =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nenergy supplied by the individual or individuals in the recording &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\narea. I also suspect that at times if we are lucky enough to be doing &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\na recording at the right time we can record a class A evp from a &lt;br&gt;\nspir=\r\nit that is not grounded but in visitation at that time.&lt;br&gt;\nBut the class A=\r\n &amp; B++ evps must be obtained from a spirit that is &lt;br&gt;\noccupying the s=\r\name area as the recording device.&lt;br&gt;\nthe second type of evp is the spiritu=\r\nal plane evp, messages recorded &lt;br&gt;\nfrom spirits that have crossed over an=\r\nd are in the spiritual world, I &lt;br&gt;\nbelieve they are still capable of send=\r\ning evp messages from the &lt;br&gt;\nspirit world only they must also use the amb=\r\nient energy surrounding &lt;br&gt;\nthe recorder or compile it and place it onto t=\r\nhe recorder. In other &lt;br&gt;\nwords a much harder and less effective method fo=\r\nr the spirit leaving &lt;br&gt;\nthe message. Therefore the messages we receive in=\r\n this manner are &lt;br&gt;\noften weak quiet and a bit distorted but they are the=\r\nre.&lt;br&gt;\nIf we take the time to look for them and clean them up most of them=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\nare understandable also the majority of these messages tend to be of =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\na personal nature most likely from friends or loved ones that have &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\ncrossed. The only thing that stops these messages from being &lt;br&gt;\ndiscove=\r\nred is that almost all the paranormal community subscribes to &lt;br&gt;\nthe idea=\r\n that the only valid evp is the class A evp that does not &lt;br&gt;\nneed to be c=\r\nleaned or enhanced in any way.&lt;br&gt;\nThere are many evp researchers out there=\r\n I&#39;m sure that have started &lt;br&gt;\nand adhered to the method of evp capture t=\r\nhat they first learned &lt;br&gt;\nabout in a book or on the Internet and have not=\r\n for lack of &lt;br&gt;\ninformation or the opportunity to learn how to edit a rec=\r\nording using &lt;br&gt;\nan audio editing program stuck to the strict set of recor=\r\nding &lt;br&gt;\ntechniques that are mostly explained on the net in one form or &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nanother. And I also believe that they witness the systematic &lt;br&gt;\nslaugh=\r\nter of anyone who dares to post or mention any new or radical &lt;br&gt;\nidea or =\r\nform of evp capture so they shy away from taking the leap and &lt;br&gt;\ntrying s=\r\nome new or seldom recognized method and stick to the &quot;OLD&quot; &lt;br&gt;\na=\r\nnd most widely accepted method out of fear of being ostracised &lt;br&gt;\namo9ng =\r\ntheir paranormal peers and I do mean peers , No one in this &lt;br&gt;\nfield is a=\r\nny better than the next person there are only PI&#39;s with &lt;br&gt;\nmore experienc=\r\ne and ones with less but some with the more experience &lt;br&gt;\ngo through the =\r\nmotions of investigation with blinders on following an &lt;br&gt;\nantiquated set =\r\nof investigatory and research rules and not opening &lt;br&gt;\ntheir minds to any=\r\nthing else.&lt;br&gt;\nMy theory of the two different types of evp is formed from =\r\nmy &lt;br&gt;\npersonal experience with different methods of recording and capture=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\nand I have evps that are very personal in nature mentioning my name &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nas well as subject matter unique to me and my family that would have &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nbeen totally over looked if not for a good editing session.&lt;br&gt;\nNO one c=\r\nan make me believe especially the so called seasoned veterans &lt;br&gt;\nthat an =\r\nevp that mentions my name and that of friends and or loved &lt;br&gt;\nones can be=\r\n randomly put together from editing filters being used on &lt;br&gt;\nraw static.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nWell those are my thought on evp please do not hesitate to let me &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nknow what you think of this theory.&lt;br&gt;\nBruce halliday&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;span style=3D&#39;color:white&#39;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/body&gt;\n\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0010_01C7C6D7.E5BF0D40--"}
