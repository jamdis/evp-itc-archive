I am interested in the skype sessions, will someone back up and refresh me?  I don't think I was privy for the first of the conversations. 
   
  I have a team member working with a friend in Malta. They talk on skype alot, and get ALOT OF EVPS. We figured it was from interferance, but the voices seemed to correlate with what was conspiring with the family.
   
  Thanks alot guys
  
Regan
