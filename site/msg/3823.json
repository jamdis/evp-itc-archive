I hear the name Erland mentioned from time to time I imagine he is very busy. I tried a new session at a higher volume. This time there were mentions of other &#39;stations&#39; or control points. They seem to be testing or comparing reception. I hear what might be a new word &#39;recept&#39; like in reception. I hear this mainly as a low male voice like a weak radio signal.\n\n&quot;Choose Amsterdam to recept David&#39;s signal&quot;\n\nThe other chatter indicates they are somehow tracking the output of the optical microphone, they call it a SeptiCom.\n\nDave\n\n--- lisby@... wrote:\n\nFrom: Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] RS 12-469 Recordings using the Optical Microphone\nDate: Mon, 3 Dec 2007 18:43:53 -0500\n\nWow. I hear all of these clearly. Bravo.\n\nI&#39;m assuming that Erland is our late friend, Erland Babcock?\n\nAnn\n\n\nOn Dec 3, 2007, at 7:19 AM, RetroCom wrote:\n\n&gt; I did the simple hack on the RS 12-469.
