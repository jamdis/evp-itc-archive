Hi, Rick.

Back in the day when I was working on my Ph.D. thesis, which involved some technical stuff about the history of the development of multitrack recording, and the effects of electronic mediation on vocal music performance, I came across a reference to Edison. I apologize, but I have long since lost the original citation, so I can't offer it to you.

What I remember from my research at the time was that Edison did indeed believe that the voices of spirits could be recorded, and in fact his work on what turned out to be the phonograph (capturing voices on wax cylinders, later on flat platters, later on what we call records) was intended to eventually lead to being able to record spirit voices. Apparently he got as far as figuring out how to record incarnate human voices <g>, but stopped before he got any spirit voices. I seem to dimly remember some comment that he thought his technology needed to be further developed, but he didn't pursue it, at least not in any way that has ever been publicly disclosed.

Hope this helps, though the citation is lacking!

Best,

Leslie
