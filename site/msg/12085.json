As I stated, I was skeptical of the \nresults, just by very method used would be hard to distinguish from \ncoincidence.I was not prepeared, however,  for the results we got from \nmy first use with this box.\n\nActivity in our place has been on the rise, so I figured, wth, I will \ntry it first in our own place. When I asked if present entities knew \nthe name of the person&#39;s room we were in, we received the answer \ntwice: &quot;Kristen&quot; once loudly, and again several seconds later a softer \nvoice came through and repeated. The box accurately told my wife her \nown name as a means of validation, and advised it followed me home from \na cemetery investigation several weeks ago. I have been investigating \nsince 1999, so this isn&#39;t my first attachment, but this is my first \nconfirmation via ITC. The box even said the name of the small rural \ntown where the cemetery was.\n\nI am not sure of the mechanism, and not sure if it isn&#39;t some PK \nelement of the operators present or a legitimate external entity making \ncontact, but...I must say I never expected the contextually accurate \nresponses to immediate questioning. Goes without saying I will be \nconducting another session in the near future. One odd thing, the \nrecorder I had running at the time inexplicably lost power (new batt) \nat 6:12 minutes in the middle of the session, so I missed recording the \nlast half. I will upload the file as soon as I locate my now MIA patch \ncord.\n\nThanks all,\nAndy"}
