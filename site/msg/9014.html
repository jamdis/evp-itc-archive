Margaret,
    I too wish I was in a financial position to give away a lot b=
oxes, but I'm not so I have helped people in making them online by showing =
them the videos.  Heck, even if someone brought me one so I could make the =
hack for them I would do that.
    
    I tend to think the Mini-Box is a d=
ifferent category than the RS hacks just because of the manufacturing invol=
ved in the kits.  I think it's a little pricey and so I won't buy one, but =
if they were cheaper I probably would out of respect for the person who wen=
t through all of the trouble of getting them made.   

    Now for the RS h=
acks, there isn't any manufacturing involved, but opening it up, cutting a =
pin, and closing it.   It takes under a minute to do.  If the person was se=
lling them right above cost for that minute of time, then I could believe i=
n what they are doing.  But they are selling them at twice the amount.  Now=
 maybe I am a little deep involved with paranormal research and have always=
 done this for free over the years to help people and that's why I get a li=
ttle offended at people who want to rip people off.

    That's one reason =
why I really like this board is that everyone is willing to help everyone t=
o better forward the research and advancement of what we do and not make a =
buck off of it. :)  <<<group hug>>>

All the best,
Bryan

oxes on ebay

                Hi Bruce.  That's wonderful your are in a fin=
ancial position to be so generous. :-) 

I don't know if we can really go s=
o far as to say that people who buy from eBay are 
receiving units with the=
 wrong kind of energy attached, just because profiting from sales 
isn't a =
course of action you or I, nor some others would take.  If that is the case=
, where do 
we draw the line?  I paid a hefty price for my MiniBox, as have=
 many others.  I'm sure there 
is some profit involved there.  The energy o=
f it seems just fine to me and I hold no 
disregard toward Ron for recogniz=
ing there is a market for his devices.

Perhaps those who log onto eBay loo=
king to find something so they can experiment with 
automated sweep feel it=
's their lucky day when they discover such a listing?  Maybe they 
even fee=
l it's a 'sign' that it's the right thing for them to do some research.  An=
d as far as 
the seller is concerned, we don't know what their attitude or =
motivation is, unless we know 
them personally.  Reminds me of a person on =
the cleaning crew who used to steal the food 
from the fridge at one of my =
corporate jobs.  Everyone was so harsh and judgmental about 
it, until one =
day, we learned she was feeding her hungry children!

Even if the person se=
lling the units is the most greedy person in the world, I fully believe it =

is far more the attitude and intention of the person conducting the experi=
ments which 
influence the energy of communication devices, than the attitu=
de of the people selling the 
devices.  It's my opinion WE are the ones who=
 attract what comes through to us on our 
equipment, much more so than the =
equipment itself.
