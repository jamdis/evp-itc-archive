One thing that bugs me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about doing sessions is that you can never be sure whether the clear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; communications received are EVP or box related. It has been shown in\n&gt; studies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that EVP&#39;s can be received in a vacuum so even recording a session with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; using the line out may capture EVP&#39;s (but probably is much less likely\n&gt; to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This clip is from June 2009 at Rolling Hills Asylum. I am sure that\n&gt; this is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an EVP because it my recorder was set up about 12 feet from the shack\n&gt; hack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and it was the only recorder from that session to pick up this audio.\n&gt; This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is a genuine Class A EVP, which is a rare thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We were conducting a session and you can hear the cycle through ending\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; starting again. We were just about to end the session and had just\n&gt; called\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for any last minute communications when this clip occurred.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I use Google Chrome as a browser, so and it has problems with\n&gt; attachments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; According to Chrome, the link is here:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Tim%20Woolworth/Misc/TW_RH_Xmas_I\n&gt; &#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Here I&#39;m Here.mp3\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If that doesn&#39;t work, here is the folder (the only clip in it):\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Tim%20Woolworth/Misc/\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tim\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;EVP-ITC%\n&gt; 40yahoogroups.com&gt;, April\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Abercrombie &lt;april@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Listening to the box is certainly not like listening to an EVP and I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personally disagree vehemently with the people out there who call box\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communications EVP&#39;s!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I totally agree. Electronic Voice Phenomena is a completely different\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; animal.

A box session forces one to listen\n&gt; through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noise as opposed to the silence.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Were these sessions recorded and listened back too or was an\n&gt; analysis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; made\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; strictly from real time? I do sessions all the time and I am lucky\n&gt; if I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pick up 35% of what comes through in real time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And finally, try not to be too dismayed. An EVP &#39;expert&#39; makes\n&gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bread\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and butter parading their EVP techniques. I witnessed one such\n&gt; expert\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all have at least heard of create an EVP. How? The person in\n&gt; question\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scratched their thumb nail against the recorders mic to create a\n&gt; sound.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person then played back the recorder to me and pitched it down to\n&gt; make\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this person say what was heard sound more convincing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I made my money parading my EVP ability, I would discredit your\n&gt; box\n&gt; &gt; &gt; too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why? Because box users are the future of ITC and paranormal\n&gt; research.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relatively cheap, vastly available, and provides instant gratuity\n&gt; when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operating. Who wants to sit alone in the dark talking to silence\n&gt; when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can hear the responses in real time? EVP is still a valid form of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication, but ghost boxes threaten an EVP experts way to make\n&gt; &gt; &gt; money.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Boxes are being used more and more, especially on the television\n&gt; shows\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public hunts. This hurts the revenue stream for EVP experts who\n&gt; used to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the ones getting invited to guest star on hunts for a fee; they are\n&gt; now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being replaced by box users.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In short, box use can be discredited by every expert and skeptic in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field. It doesn&#39;t matter. Ghost box use now has its place in\n&gt; paranormal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; culture and it is not going to leave it anytime soon. Being\n&gt; situated in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paranormal group that is lead by a para-celebrity has put me in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; unique\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; position of visiting other groups and working with the other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; para-celebrities in this field quite frequently. I can assure you\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ghost\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boxes aren&#39;t going anywhere because the majority of these people\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least a shack hack in their paranormal arsenal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So let this expert discredit to his or her&#39;s hearts&#39; content.
