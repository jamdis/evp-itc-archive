Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Nissan the movie.
=

=C2=A0 

I typically refrain from posting on the boards precisely because =
of people like you who feel that their insipid comments are worth hearing. =
There is nothing wrong with skepticism, hell, I have been in a relationship=
 with a laboratory scientist who is an atheist for going on four years now =
so I know what skepticism is supposed to sound like. I hear it everyday. Yo=
ur posts do not reflect the nature of skepticism, they reflect outright den=
ial. There is a difference betwixt the two, and it is not slight.

Why? Bec=
ause you claim to want irrefutable proof. Yet, you do nothing about it. As =
the old adage goes, it's time for you to sh*t or get off the pot. Get your =
hands on a ghost box and start experimenting. There are numerous radios to =
hack yourself, so do it already (granted, a hack is by no means up to par w=
ith a Frank's Box, Minibox, or any of the other guys doing this, but it wil=
l get you started). Then take the time to design controlled experiments to =
be implemented. Share your results. Write up a paper about it. Follow the s=
cientific method. There are ghost box users all over the country, so I am s=
ure you can find someone relatively close to you to work with if you actual=
ly want to take the time and responsibility of adding any knowledge to this=
 community. 

Do something, anything, other than gripe about not having eno=
ugh 'proof.' Epistemological knowledge has been debated by much better mind=
s for thousands of years and the very notion of proof is still, well, unpro=
vable. Exactly like science. What we believe today may not be true next yea=
r. Talk to any post-modernist in this post-modern society we live in and he=
 will tell you that the notion of scientific proof is meaningless precisely=
 because its very knowledge base is in constant flux. Gravity may be here t=
oday as a constant, but we cannot know with certainty the same will be true=
 tomorrow. This is why we have the scientific method to explore variables. =
This is why skepticism is good. 

We are all individuals, functioning indiv=
idually in this field. We do not have government funding. We do not have Ph=
D's working on this stuff. We have guys and girls, in their homes and shops=
, trying to understand the incomprehensible. Can you not realize that we al=
l know that the evidence we collect is instantly disprovable and will alway=
s be so? Just the simple fact of audio clips being posted here abnegates th=
e power of empiricism. As you have stated, you are a skeptic. No audio clip=
 will provide you with empirical evidence because you did not collect it yo=
urself and therefore too many variables involved make it easily dismissable=
 with just an iota of scientific rigor. We accept that, and you cannot. The=
refore, your mere presence alone on these forums is antagonistic to the wor=
k we do because we can never provide you with proof.

How can you expect pr=
oof when we do not even know with certainty whether we are talking to spiri=
ts, ET's, gods, or frickin unicorns.

How can you expect proof when the ver=
y nature of spirit and afterlife is wholly unprovable.

How can you expect =
proof in a yahoo forum? Does not the very nature of a forum defy all skepti=
cal enquiry?

And finally, speaking of forums, you are a guest in one run b=
y people who believe this to be true expressly for people who believe likew=
ise. 

So why are you here?

So please, do something to add to the communit=
y and quit relying on others to do it for you. If you keep relying on this =
forum to give you proof, you will always be disappointed because there is n=
o proof other than the audio clips you deny. 

Period.

For the other forum=
 users, I'm sorry to feed the troll this time. I know its best to let them =
starve, but once in a while you just might be able to shoo them away from t=
he bridge to allow a safe crossing (yes, pun intended).
