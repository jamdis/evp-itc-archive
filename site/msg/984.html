 Weird how these voices sound, but I can hear they one sent. The way I look 
 at spirit stuff is that we all continue, pretty much the same as we are now, 
 but more enlightened hopefully, but with bodies, and all. On those rare 
 occasions that I actually see spirit, they have a bodies, just like in life. 
 I think there's technology on the otherside, but since there been spirit 
 infinately longer than anything physical, it's so advanced that it just seem 
 like magic, and we, here have no comprehension of how it works.  I also have 
 to wonder if maybe it's not just the developed mind over there, maybe they 
 reach a point where they can manipulate our physical world with thought 
 alone. That's like two avenues of conjecture that I ponder from time to 
 time.
 
 There's so much, like what are orbs, and how do they work, as they seem to 
 cause EVPs as well?
