I disconnect the\nprocessor board, after determining the function of the signals going to the\nradio board. You have to be able to turn on the radio itself with no\nprocessor board, then find the band change connection, the tuning voltage\nconnection.\n\n  In the first boxes I used tuner modules removed from car stereos, then\nafter the hack was &quot;discovered&quot; I started using other radios, such as the\nRadio Shack models, but I would only use the radio board, and disgard the\nrest. I have used walkman style radios as well, again, disgarding the\nprocessor board.  Usually there is a ribbon cable to the radio, you just\nhave to determine what voltages are needed to operate the radio, and supply\nthese from a power supply or voltage regulator.\n\n I use Arm Band radios, Headphone radios, alarm clock radios that have\ndigital tuning. I try to find radios that have a seperate tuner board.\n\n So far radios that use a square chip seem to be software controled, so I\navoid those. Not all digital radios are usable. The car tuners tend to be\nnoisy.\n\n Sometimes you can find the tuning voltage in a radio and just cut he\nconnection, then insert an external tuning voltage from a sweep circuit. I\nhave a Aiwa home stereo system that I made into a box using this method.\nIt&#39;s not portable, but it works well, it has the advantage of a built in\ntape recorder.\n\n\nF-S\nOn Tue, Sep 28, 2010 at 10:36 PM, Luis &lt;luispucp098@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; One question Frank , its posible make a frank box whith an analogic radio ?\n&gt; ... its a problem make it here in Peru .
