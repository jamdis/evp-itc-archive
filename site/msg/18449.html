<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks to everyone who participated in Experiment 4.

On Friday, 8/6/2010 I placed an object in front of my fireplace, on the brick hearth, and left it there until noon Denver time on Monday, 8/9/2010.   This experiment asked for participants to determine what that object is. Vague or partial answers won&#x27;t be counted (for example, just giving a color, shape, size, what it&#x27;s made of, etc): we&#x27;re looking for what it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#x27;t count.  Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means they chose.  At the end of the experiment, I will reveal the object, and a tally of the number of correct and/or incorrect answers.

In order to keep me honest, I had taken a picture of the object at the start of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group.  The idea with this file is that you could download it and &#x27;keep it safe&#x27; on your computer. Then at the end of the experiment, I would post the password so you could reveal the contents of the file. That way, you were in control of the original image during the entire test, not me.  

Password pdf: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100806.pdf
The password for the file was: StillThe1

So to the results:

Number of participants: 1
Total tries: 1
Ambiguous answers: 0
Correct answers: 0

Object:  Hammer
Object picture: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100806.jpg


If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let me know. Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this experiment.</pre>
