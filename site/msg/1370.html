&gt;Mark Macy has posted two articles I wrote about Frank&#x27;s Box,
&gt;concerning the controversy the box has caused in the paranormal
&gt;investigation community.  The articles are published this month in
&gt;TAPS Paramagazine.  The pdf can be viewed at
&gt;http://spiritfaces.com/x200706ParamagArticl.pdf.  For those not in
&gt;ghost work, TAPS is The Paranormal Atlantic Society, members of whom
&gt;star in The SciFiChannel&#x27;s  popular Ghost Hunters reality show.
&gt;
&gt;Briefly, at a Ghost Hunters haunted week at The Stanley Hotel in
&gt;Colorado in March, the 200+ attendees were given demonstrations of
&gt;the box by Chris Moon.  There were two open mike nights in which lots
&gt;were drawn for people to come up and ask questions via the box.
&gt;Chris interpreted answers, and was assisted by medium Chip Coffey.
&gt;Many of the attendees had never heard of the box, and most of them
&gt;had never seen it in operation, and it caused quite a stir.   Chris
&gt;also took the box into one of the hotel&#x27;s more active haunted rooms,
&gt;as part of the featured ghost investigations.
&gt;
&gt;There were two other boxes present on site for part of the time,
&gt;owned by Randy Schneider and Bill Murphy.  Fortunately, these boxes
&gt;were not pressed into service for paranormal tap dancing.  I was
&gt;especially happy to be able to participate in small group private
&gt;sessions with both Randy and Bill (and one of which included Mark),
&gt;which I found far more illuminating.
&gt;
&gt;One article concerns the controversy over the box (for example,
&gt;should it be used in haunted places to provoke ghosts; can it dial up
&gt;the dead on demand), and the other is a Q&amp;A interview I did with
&gt;Frank.
&gt;
&gt;Personally, I agree with Frank&#x27;s vision for the box as an ITC tool.
