I think its a good idea \nto let people know if they are really interested in one they can get \none at radio shack and hack their own. Since it was your idea if you \nwant to you can list it or I will. I just hate to see people paying \n$100 for one.\n\nKay\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Marlboro63@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Kay,\n&gt;  \n&gt; That was what I posted on my original idea over a week ago and I \nwas  blasted \n&gt; about it especially that I would look like a fool that I was \nwilling to  take \n&gt; a loss of a few bucks.  But atleast the hacking information and \nlinks  would \n&gt; have been posted on ebay for all to see.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Jeff\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; In a message dated 4/7/2008 4:58:03 P.M.

To list \nit \n&gt; it  is $1.00 for $25.00-449.00 plus 8.75% of the initial $25.00 \n&gt; ($2.19), plus  3.50% of the remaining closing value balance \n($25.01 \n&gt; to  $1,000.00)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I would be willing to list the one I have plus give the  \ninformation \n&gt; on the free hacking and that fact that you can get one at  Radio \n&gt; Shack for $24.99 just to shut this guy down. At the most I would \nbe  \n&gt; out $1.00 to not sell it!!!! Well worth it I&#39;d say.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can someone  send me the written instructions on how to hack the  \n12-\n&gt; 249.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kay\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ (mailto:EVP-\nITC@yahoogroups.com) , &quot;LC  \n&gt; Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Either that, or  anyone willing to make them for $25 + shipping \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; no profit?  You could then list them just like the ones that are \n&gt; &gt; selling...so  they pull up identical to the listings that are up \n&gt; &gt; there. :)\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ (mailto:EVP-\nITC@yahoogroups.com) ,  \n&gt; &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was thinking if someone would list a FREE DOWNLOAD of  \n&gt; &gt; instructions for the various hacks \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the Radio Shack  units, it could put an end to the business \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; sellers that are  taking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; advantage of people who are unaware that they could  probably \n&gt; hack \n&gt; &gt; the units for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves. \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen &quot;downloads&quot; of various things listed before.
