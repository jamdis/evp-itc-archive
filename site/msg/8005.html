  I had the 20-125, and hack it with the instruction that you gave me.  I didn't get any results with that box as I told you before in the other group.  Of course I took it back and I stuck with my 469, because my tech didn't like the radio either.  My question is if I accidentally cut the wire left of the MU wire would that affect the reception with the radio?

Hey guy's,

Here are a few from a session with the 125 a couple of day's ago.

For the new people that may be working with the RS 12-469 and would 
like to have a box without the clicking on AM and also an internal 
speaker and telescope antenna.

You should give this 20-125 a shot! I have gotten some of my best 
communication using this little dynamo. and it's very affordable and 
simple to hack.

If anyone has any questions please feel free.

Bruce
