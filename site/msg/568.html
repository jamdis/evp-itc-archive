The undertaker one was pretty clear for everyone I think. Even hubby can hear that one. What does it mean? Well for me it meant just because they are dead doesnt mean they have lost thier senses of humor. He almost got kicked out by the guides for that smarta$$ remark until the others came to his defense and said he means no harm. A few understood why he said it... they have the same sick sense of humor LOL

hear it easily because for me it is very clear. Probably one of the 
clearest so far.

Just heard that undertaker recording of your Misty -- very clear! I 
wonder what it means?
