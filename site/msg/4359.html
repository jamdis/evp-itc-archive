<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just because we project our thoughts into a Box session or even if we 
hear our thoughts in our own voice when playing back an evp it 
doesn&#x27;t make it any less real. I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s problematic, I 
think it&#x27;s getting closer to discovering what the origin of the 
phenomena is. It&#x27;s our own pk energy. Our devices may picking up our 
own psychic communication with the invisibles. -Bill

&gt;  In working with LM3820, that&#x27;s the Delco radio chips I got form 
B.G. Micro at 12 cents each, I had the things working a while back on 
the breadbord, but the chips would not work when wired up on a 
circuit board. I drew the damn schematic wrong!!! I&#x27;m wiring a new 
board, and looking at the origninal schematic I had on -line, and I&#x27;m 
thinking what the f---, this ain&#x27;t right. I haven&#x27;t powered up the 
board yet, but it should work----this time.

&gt;  I keep telling everyone you hear what you want to hear, or what 
the subconcious mind projects, even onto pre-recorded tapes! 
Listening last night to the tape I did Sunday night, and the Ol&#x27; Lady 
yells out that the mattress heater was not working, and the very next 
voice on the tape is about the matress heater not working! I doubt 
very much that anyone else would hear it, but that is the probelm 
with this stuff, few hear what others hear. Was the heater 
voice &quot;real&quot;--I can&#x27;t tell!! Maybe it&#x27;s a precongnitive voice--I 
can&#x27;t tell! I think we create some this stuff on the fly, which is 
very problematic for the research, but it has to be addressed.
