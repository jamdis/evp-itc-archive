My first evp was my mothers voice and=\r\n no boxes were involved. The box is a tool/method and there are many ways t=\r\no get their voices heard. So in the different methods I have used, yes I ha=\r\nve heard voices that resemble their lifetime charachteristics and tones. Is=\r\n it always that way? No. \n\n        Most often the group will speak as one v=\r\noice because I have requested they do so. One voice tone will begin a sente=\r\nnce and another will end it. So I may hear my female friends voice start of=\r\nf a thought and an unknown male voice finish the sentence. And vice versa o=\r\nften they speak in tones which do not even come close to what they sounded =\r\nlike in life. Quite often they are spirits I didnt know in life. I may get =\r\nsomeone saying This is edison, and then find an old recording he did where =\r\nhe starts it off saying This is edison, but for me I do not know the man so=\r\n there is no recognition for me. I document it and file it away as a curiou=\r\nsity.\n\n        I always laugh when people say thats not your mother or frie=\r\nnd thats something trying to fool you and mess with your head. I knew my mo=\r\nther longer than anyone and its interesting that it is easier for those peo=\r\nple to believe that its possible that something/someone else is speaking pr=\r\netending to be my mother but its much harder for them to believe that quite=\r\n possibly that really is my mother keeping her promise to stay in touch aft=\r\ner death. If one is possible then so is the other. I tend to be stubborn in=\r\n some respects in that I dont instantly believe what anyone tells me whethe=\r\nr living or not. If they give me a message I think is dumb I am very reluct=\r\nant to pass it on and usually those are the ones that get the biggest confi=\r\nrmations tho it means nothing to me at the time. So yes quite possibly evp =\r\nwork can be used the same as mediumship in missing persons cases.\n\n        =\r\nFor me tone of voice has grown to mean nothing. It is a treat when they man=\r\nage to come across sounding as they did when in physical form here but I lo=\r\nok beyond the tone of voice. Often people get a childs voice and they becom=\r\ne saddened by the thought that a child is earthbound. But I see it just as =\r\na representation of voice and whether it comes across as male female child =\r\nor robot matters little to me.\n\n        I do find they often resume the &quot;ch=\r\naracter&quot; they played because after all that is sort of what we are, charact=\r\ners in some giant play. Whether it is the beliefs they had which were their=\r\n trademark, the tone of voice, their image, or use of some nickname even I =\r\ndont know about I look at it all as just a pixel in a larger portrait that =\r\nsome part survives once the body has ceased to function. And the message is=\r\n simply, our energy continues on.\n\n        Quote by Einstein: &#39;Energy canno=\r\nt be created or destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another.=\r\n&#39;\n\n        Misty (the insomniac is up way tooooo late and rambling on LOL)\n=\r\n\n        --- On Tue, 9/15/09, mrscaptainjack2 &lt;jjkamp@...&gt; wrote:\n\n=\r\n\n          From: mrscaptainjack2 &lt;jjkamp@...&gt;\n          Subject: [E=\r\nVP-ITC] Voice inflections?\n          To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n          =\r\nDate: Tuesday, September 15, 2009, 9:56 PM\n\n\n            \n          I was g=\r\noogling about AM radio reception, and I came across the below exchange on a=\r\n forum.
