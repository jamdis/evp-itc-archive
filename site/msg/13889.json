[4 Attachments]\n\n\n  [Attachment(s) from Frank Sumption included below] \n\n=\r\n\n\n   This is from the old RS digital that I did last night. Mostly they see=\r\nmed to be talk about Chris Moon, and the box with the lever switches, which=\r\n is #46. For those that may have heard otherwise, experimenting with tones =\r\nwas my idea, there was no &quot;specifications&quot; for the box from any other sourc=\r\ne, same as with all other boxes.  I know many have a problem with Moon, and=\r\n I can understand that, but there seems to be a level, or group of spirits =\r\nthat do work with him. I do not agree with the Edison thing, but... what do=\r\n  ya do? \n\n   I had been playing with tones since box #5, and just this yea=\r\nr tried to incorporate that into the design again as some of the voices wer=\r\ne asking for eight signals. 46 and 47 have the eight tones, although I&#39;m no=\r\nt sure what frequency they are supposed to be, but eight suggests musical s=\r\ncales. So far it seems to do little to enhance the voices. 46 and 47 are mo=\r\nre like breadboarded systems, they are not in cabinets, just mounted on a p=\r\nlywood base with a make shift front panel. I put four tone generators in 51=\r\n, just cuz I had some extra board space. \n\n   Of course &quot;they&quot; want 46, it&#39;=\r\ns the best box of this year, and I&#39;ve been relucatant to give it up. Even i=\r\nn spirit communcations, you can tell which are the human spirits. Just cuz =\r\nthey are dead doesn&#39;t mean they have any higher modivations. I remain reluc=\r\ntant to give this stuff so someone else can claim it&#39;s an Edison invnetion,=\r\n or to claim demons and shadow people come through box, or it opens portals=\r\n, and on and on. I&#39;m pretty discouraged with all things paranormal. I&#39;m not=\r\n jumping up and rushing out just cuz some voice said something, been there =\r\ndone that, and it&#39;s always disappointing. \n\n   Frank-S\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_00AB_01C9C260.16DC6000\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18702&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 =\r\nface=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;What is interesting to me with these \nrecordings is tha=\r\nt they appear to all be in the same voice.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nBLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; PAD=\r\nDING-RIGHT: 0px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; \ndir=3Dltr&gt;\n  &lt;DIV st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV \n  styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial; BACKGROUND: #e4e4e4; font-color: black&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt;=\r\n \n  &lt;A title=3Dpurplealiengirl@... \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:purplealiengirl@=\r\ngmail.com&quot;&gt;Frank Sumption&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;T=\r\no:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A title=3Devp-itc@yahoogroups.com \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:evp-itc@yahoogr=\r\noups.com&quot;&gt;evp-itc@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; ; &lt;A \n  title=3Dgrassharp@yahoogroups=\r\n.com \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:grassharp@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;grassharp@yahoogroups.com=\r\n&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Tuesday, April 2=\r\n1, 2009 8:56 \n  AM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; =\r\n[EVP-ITC] This might chap some \n  hides.
