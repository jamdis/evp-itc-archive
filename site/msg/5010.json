It does start scanning and searching \nfor a station when I push the up or down button for 1 second as \ndecribed in the directions; but then the radio never stops on any \nstation.\nIt just keeps going, continually sweeping the entire band it is \ncurrently on.  What good is this if it doesn&#39;t stop on a radio station?\nAll I hear coming from the speaker are snippets of raw audio.  Just \nlinear sweeping raw audio.\nI can not figure any use for this, so I decided to sell it.\nIt works fine as long as you don&#39;t try to scan and search for a \nstation, then as I said it just goes on a linear sweep of the band \nuntil you stop it or turn it off.\n\n:-)"}
