Before I gave it a test\n&gt; run, I made it clear I was only doing a test and that I did not intend\n&gt; to make any contact. About half way through the first sweep, I heard\n&gt; my name.\n&gt;\n&gt; Very exciting and somewhat startling at the same time. Hopefully I\n&gt; can get time to do an actual session tonight. I understand it can\n&gt; take some time for the box to get &quot;imprinted&quot; as Bruce says.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you Steve for finding this hack and thanks to the others here\n&gt; for your endless help to everyone on the board.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeremy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The contents of this eletronic correspondence is private &  \n&gt; confidential and meant only for the party and/or parties it is  \n&gt; addressed to.\n&gt;\n&gt; No part of this email transmission may be publicly posted or  \n&gt; forwarded to other parties without explicit written permission.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\nB a o, Je emy!
