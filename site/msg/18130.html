<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think this test is a bit ridiculous . First of all when I turn on my box and ask &quot; What does RJ have sitting on top of his monitor&quot; There probably like who the frig is RJ . When you die I dont think you get magical powers . There just people . They cant tell me what you have sitting on your monitor  maybe if you were involved in the session you might be able to get an answer but what your trying to do will never work . like I said they were just people once
