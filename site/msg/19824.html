<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think maybe try the one of the various hack boxes first. The ghost box is
just a radio that sweeps across it&#x27;s tuning range providing bits of speech
music and noise that the entities use to form thier voices. At least that&#x27;s
the theory anyway, there seems to be more involved on their end. The hack
box is a digital radio that is easily modified so it when it tries to search
for a station, it won&#x27;t lock on to any stations, and it still outputs sound,
so you get the the bits of raw audio needed for spirit communication. You
can also do the sweep by supplying an expertal sweep voltage inthe form of a
triangle wave, or you can do the sweep by hand, just by turning the tuning
dial while recording.

 Personally, I prefer to record, and listen to the recording, as I miss most
of the communication if I try to listen live. I just let them talk, rarely
ask questions, and allow anyone/anything to speak.

&gt; I&#x27;m interested in EVP/ITC/Spiricom so that I can get audio recordings
&gt; proving that Spirit exists, that each natural-born man or woman of the
&gt; Spirit IS a differentiated spirit (either with, or without a physical body)
&gt; and that after physical death the spirit body continues on, especially if
&gt; the physical body was subjected to death before its time.
&gt;
&gt; In particular I met, and fell in love with on first meeting (and only
&gt; physical meeting) a woman in 2000 whose physical body died as a result of
&gt; traumas caused by landing on rocks from 40 feet above;
&gt; it appears likely that she was murdered instead of the public story which
&gt; was that it was &quot;an accidental fall from a height&quot; with &quot;no foul play&quot;
&gt; involved. In 2008, she returned to find me and did find me. I saw her in
&gt; spirit walking up and down the main road near where her physical body had
&gt; gone off the cliff. I thought it was maybe just my imagination
&gt; but then some months later she showed up in my house, laying on my bed. I
&gt; could see her there in full (yet fully transparent) colour, moving slightly.
&gt; I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes but having been very spiritually sensitive and
&gt; open all my life, it was almost .. almost second nature and I just about
&gt; jumped on her on the bed to give her a big hug. It may sound crazy but we
&gt; stayed together the whole day and talked psychically about everything under
&gt; the sun, moon and stars, then fell asleep in each other&#x27;s &#x27;arms&#x27; at the end
&gt; of the day; I woke up at 6:01 the next morning to find out she was still
&gt; there! I was then reminded of the whole experience, and burst out with total
&gt; emotion and asked her with total sincerity to marry me ... and she accepted
&gt; saying &quot;Yes!!!&quot; ... (I quickly noted down the exact date and time so I could
&gt; always know and remember our anniversary, which we&#x27;ve now celebrated every
&gt; year since then).
&gt;
&gt; Now after almost 3 years of being together, she and I are VERY restless
&gt; about making her communication (and our communication) much more tangible.
&gt; She&#x27;s very capable of doing EVP etc. (possibly with a little coaching on how
&gt; to do it from me, if I can learn enough about how it works myself), based on
&gt; what she&#x27;s told me, and the fact she&#x27;s shown many manifestations of being
&gt; really here and alive ... it&#x27;s just hard to convince others of this without
&gt; tangible evidence.
&gt;
&gt; So that is in essence what brought me to the EVP-ITC forum.
&gt; Thanks for having me here!
