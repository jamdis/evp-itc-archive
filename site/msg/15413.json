The white noise transistor is pretty cr=\r\nitical.

I \n&gt; &gt; had one board that was =\r\nworking and another, exactly the same that would not \n&gt; &gt; work. It turned o=\r\nut to be the transistor, as soon as I put in a Radio Shack \n&gt; &gt; 2N3904, the=\r\n thing started to work. So, it seems you need cheap generic \n&gt; &gt; transistor=\r\ns that are noisy for the RVG to work properly.

The \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n transistors that I normally use were form mouser.com, and the output was \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; only about .005v peak peak to peak. With the 2N3904&#39;s, the output is ab=\r\nout \n&gt; &gt; .05 volts. You almost have to have a scope to build these circuits=\r\n.
