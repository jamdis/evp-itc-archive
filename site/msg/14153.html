Convert it to another file type such as mp3 this extension is far smaller t=
han wav format.

You can use a software to convert it is the software y=
ou are using doesnt have that output. Most do like audacity, goldwav etc. Y=
ou just save as mp3 or whatever instead of wav. If you still have trouble h=
eres one thats free to convert.
