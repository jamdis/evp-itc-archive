Relax Ursula.


I too have been aware of this at Keith'=
s site for long, long time, but like I said in the last post, I am very new=
 to this as in doing it on my own computer. =C2=A0Just like you. =C2=A0So d=
on't act like you know what I do and do not know, thank you very much. =C2=
=A0


I am not attacking you so back the hell off. =C2=A0I made it clear th=
at this was for my own own edification, for me to accept my own images.=C2=
=A0=C2=A0


The image I ever so briefly mentioned the one posted that had s=
everal "Faces" or pieces thereof that were circled. =C2=A0As for your image=
 of the man peeking out, I saw nothing there. =C2=A0Period. =C2=A0=C2=A0Did=
 I say previously what I thought about the quality of the images in that ph=
oto? =C2=A0No. =C2=A0I politely kept it to myself because I do not like to =
differ with people or to deflate hot air balloons. =C2=A0But there you have=
 it, that is what I saw. =C2=A0And to my knowledge, that is the only time I=
 have described what I have seen thus far in your images other than mention=
ing the word "eyebrows." =C2=A0In the one that had many circles, I saw one =
that looked like a set of lips and a chin and the rest I personally thought=
 was matrixing. =C2=A0Once again, did I saw this? =C2=A0No. =C2=A0But you a=
sked for it so there it is.


The whole point of my post, had you read it w=
ith a clear head. =C2=A0It was all about my own edification, that I, and I =
alone, need to keep plugging in files before I, and I alone, make a judgeme=
nt about MY images and whether they are real or not based upon the images t=
hey provide in contrast to the bulk of other files. =C2=A0If you simply com=
pare your one image with the many circles to the youtube file, I suspect I =
am correct in saying that faces occur with much more rarity than your circl=
e file and that they can appear fully formed. =C2=A0Once again, I suspect, =
only, and I will only be able to tell after time. =C2=A0Sample size is ever=
ything, and I thought I made that abundantly clear. =C2=A0The post was simp=
ly about my process of learning rather than running out and saying look wha=
t I found when I simply don't know what has been found yet because it is th=
e first time I have played with the controls rather than seeing the end sna=
pshots on another persons website. =C2=A0


Why do you always jump on the d=
efensive and attack every one who does not fall in line with you? =C2=A0Not=
 everything has to be fight or flight, Ursula, and not every bridge has to =
be burned so thoroughly to the ground. =C2=A0This is not an attack on you o=
r results, reread the post, and this time thinking a little more clearly ab=
out what is written on the page and not your own emotional backlash constru=
ing things in the posted text that are simply not there. =C2=A0Had you done=
 this, you would have seen the point of my post was not an attack on you, i=
n ANY way. =C2=A0 =C2=A0

No, I don't think I am be=
ing too critical, but I may have expectations that are a little too high. =
=C2=A0I want to take my time with this. =C2=A0For my own understanding, I n=
eed to have a large sample size so I know not only what to expect to see, b=
ut what to look for. =C2=A0I have seen ITC snapshots from programs like thi=
s that offer full faces. =C2=A0I would be more inclined to believe in such =
an image as opposed to, lets say. two dark lines that may or may not be eye=
brows. 


Even in your example of the towel, you get half a face. =C2=A0If =
you have half a face (on the vertical plane, not the horizontal) you can ex=
trapolate out what the entire face would look like. =C2=A0This is something=
 I would like to get myself and I would consider that evidence if it showed=
 up in one of these programs. =C2=A0But, if you have something that looks l=
ike a forehead and that is all there is, then it could also look like a roc=
k or some other such object.


I am certainly hoping for results worked int=
o box sessions. =C2=A0Directing a session with intent, like saying "I am go=
ing to examine the sound waves of this communication in hopes of seeing you=
r face. =C2=A0Is it possible you can show your face to me now through sound=
? " is what I am after. =C2=A0If a positive hit like this happens, then I w=
ill be jumping for joy. =C2=A0Another good example would be a name, lets sa=
y Tom, that occurs. =C2=A0If you get a positive affirmation that the name y=
ou heard is present, then you try the same technique only you address Tom b=
y name and get a face, that would be even better.


But, as it stands now, =
the faces as they appear are random at best. =C2=A0I would be more inclined=
 to believe that when these faces do occur , they are going to occur with a=
 lesser frequency than multiple images in a few seconds of audio like Ursul=
a's example. =C2=A0If this where the case, there would be dozens, and possi=
bly hundreds, of faces during a ten minute session and I just don't think t=
hat is possible. =C2=A0This is why I need to look at several samples to fin=
d out if this is the case or not. =C2=A0If these partialized faces occur in=
 multiples all the time, I would be more apt to discount it. =C2=A0But, if =
they are a rarity affixed to only a few clips out of dozens, I would be mor=
e inclined to believe in them. =C2=A0Sample size is everything. =C2=A0It is=
 like listening to GBC. =C2=A0If you have never done a session before, you =
would be inclined to believe every stray radio signal is a communication. =
=C2=A0Only by continued practice (expanding your sample size) can you start=
 to
 rule out stray radio with any degree of accuracy. =C2=A0


On the othe=
r hand, I am very new to this and I could certainly be wrong. =C2=A0I will =
continue to plug sound into the programs and hope for the best. =C2=A0


I =
really want this to work. =C2=A0As you have probably experienced, when they=
 want you to hear something or know something, they make it very obvious wh=
ile communicating. =C2=A0I am hoping they apply this same rigor to this new=
 format to show us that they are there. =C2=A0If they can, then the world o=

<DIV>I've seen live webcast of ITC sessions where GB output is fe=
d directly into the mic line in on a computer running Adobe Audition with t=
he spectragraph running. It was really compelling to see letters and number=
s, not images or pictures, but partial words appear in the graph. At first =
it was I thought it was a software glitch but it is a repeatable event. It =
was on LiveSciFi which is run by Tim Wood, he also thought there was some k=
ind of code error but it happened on more than one webcast. <BR><BR>So if a=
nyone has Audition, just feed Box output right in your computer and see wha=
t happens. I wanted to try it tonight but I have Audacity and the spectragr=
aph feature doesn't have that shaded appearance that Audition does so it's =
not able to render images or characters, at least as far as I see using the=
 various settings.</DIV>
