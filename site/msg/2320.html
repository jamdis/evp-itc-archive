Frank,

Is there a way to tell them how to upgrade them? Are these users "e=
lectronic savvy" enough to comprehend upgrade instructions?

Regards,

Fran=
k R.

Well, Rosemary claims it's because of th=

 I have concerns about the older boxes that I now consider junk. I fee=

d can just whip out some new boxes.

Frank R,
 
That is another possible theory, It is going t=
o take a lot of experimentation to find the true answers.
And we may never =
do that. The incident that led me to that hypothesis was the first and seco=
nd 
sessions with the box they continually asked for frank and purple even =
after I stated my name as 
the user of the box and it's new location. Steve=
 also had a similar occurrence with box thirteen asking 
about Colorado and=
 purple when he first received his box. I will try to get some answers on t=
he subject 
from our friends on the other side until then your guess is as =
good as mine.

Bruce,

It has nothing to do with the box. The =
box is just a tool to make the physical connection by making their voices a=
udible. It is your spiritual connection to the group of spirits around you =
and the spirits around Frank that makes the communication possible. Frank's=
 "guys" have just become aware of you thats all. The box don't have a signa=
ture or its own aura or give off a certain vibration or whatever you want t=
o call it. It is a group of circuits that are manipulated or operated by sp=
irits. 

Everyday before you had a box you still communicated with the spir=
it group around you. Even if only on a subconscious level through influence=
. With the box you still use the same spiritual connection to communicate w=
ith them and they are using a physical medium to communicate with you.

Reg=
ards,

Frank R.

I believe that each box carries it's own signature and t=
he spirits that 
communicate through that box know the individual box by th=
e energy it 
gives off. So they get used to a certain person that has been =
using 
that individual box and when the user changes they get somewhat 
con=
fused about who is using the box. But I think they are getting used 
to me =
being the new user. my sessions are becoming more and more 
responsive. I h=
ave posted some file from session #2 with the box, they 
are in the files s=
ection please let me know what you think.
