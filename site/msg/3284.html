I just wanted to take a minute to say hi to you all. Feel free to join in the discussions. We try and keep everything available to the public so remember that when you post.
   
  About files: Sometimes we post files in the file area but that spacing is limited so many of us post things in other places (we usually provide a link to them), or we will attach the files to our posts. The only way to get them is set your group email settings to "Individual Email" setting. This will also send every persons post as an individual email to your inbox (yes sometimes theres alot LOL).
   
  I have tried to throw together a little webpage explaining some of the different methods we talk about using here besides the box method. The guys have set up some explanations for that part. http://misty.xm.com 
   
  And here is my esnips link I have posted examples from each of the methods there for people to get an idea. http://www.esnips.com/user/MistyDawn 
   
  For those interested in the ITC images category heres a link to my gallery with some examples of different methods there. http://webcamitc.myphotoalbum.com/
   
  Of anyone has any questions just ask the group. People are more than happy to help you find the answer if possible. If anyone has any questions for me personally it's always a good idea to email me if you want a prompt reply. I try to give those priority response. 
   
  Other than that, just enjoy your time here with each other. Treat each other with respect. Learn from one another. And SHARE what you find with (MEEEEE!!! LOL) everyone.
