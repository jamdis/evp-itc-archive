<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree! I am learning this field, and don&#x27;t enjoy people criticizing the communication shared. 

And as for RJ&#x27;s experiments. RJ doesn&#x27;t want to share any info, not even the city and state where the spirits may find him/her. Spirits are people, and not all knowing. We may as well ask RJ (without location or full name) what we put on top of our monitors. If he/she is wrong, then he/she must not exist, making RJ&#x27;s posts a figment of our imagination.

I haven&#x27;t been reading RJ&#x27;s posts for awhile, but when I do, and see that RJ is upsetting Frank continuously, and it&#x27;s Frank&#x27;s list, that isn&#x27;t cool.

&gt; This is Frank&#x27;s group and I am here to learn how to make the boxes and talk amongst other people
&gt; with boxes about what we get... we are not here to listen to people who don&#x27;t believe in what we are
&gt; doing or trying to do.... If you don&#x27;t have a box to work with or listen to, how can you be skeptical about
&gt; what someone hears regardless of whether they write out what they hear or not? Alot of times we don&#x27;t hear
&gt; the same things ,so it is ridiculous for people to believe it&#x27;s the power of suggestion.
&gt; RJ&#x27;s experiments are to disprove for his own personal reasons, not to help this group in any way.
&gt; So, why don&#x27;t you skeptical people and the ones who want to try different methods and any other personal
&gt; ideas that you have, start your own group?  This is Frank&#x27;s group......
&gt; I personally want to see what Frank and Steve come up with and that&#x27;s why MOST of us are here....
&gt; not to criticize them..or try to do experiments disproving anything....

&gt; if frank will end that project here, then you (or we all) have the possibility to open another yahoo group and we can continue
&gt; to discussing. in a group all members must have the opportunity to write his ideas and, if someone like RJ (or some others,
&gt; maybe like me) tend to other types of ideas and try to point to other prespectives, what is here wrong?
&gt; 
&gt; we must be prepared to all evidences, also evidences that are not convenient to our personal ideas but
&gt; maybe we can learn something more and we can change our point of view. think about that.
&gt; 
&gt; i try to reach the goal of the &quot;voices&quot; with a sceptict mind, but i am experimenting with many differente methods to hopefully
&gt; reach maybe one day something more convincing.

&gt; I am  worried that he is going to push Frank to far and Frank will not be here anymore
&gt; THAT IS WHAT I AM AFRAID OF... And he is the most important person here.
&gt; It&#x27;s his group....and if he gets mad enough he will end it, and then what ?

&gt; i hope that RJ stay for a long time here because i like its methods and his ideas.
&gt; if you dont like read his mails, then lets swing the delete key on your keyboard.
&gt; leave him write his ideas, because others (like me) want to continue to read.

&gt; RJ, it is very obvious that you are not here for the same reasons we are. We are trying to prove something we know, and
&gt; you are trying to disprove it .
&gt; Why don&#x27;t we all just ignore him from now on and not reply to anything he says and maybe he will go away.....
&gt; Bye RJ. You are just not in the group that you need to be in....

&gt; I realize you have plenty of subjective anecdotal evidence.I don&#x27;t consider that &#x27;hard evidence&#x27; however.  I am looking for something a little more objective and less subject to influence and interpretations.
&gt; 
&gt; And stop putting words in my mouth. A person can misinterpret something, mistake something, or confuse something, without lying about something.  And before you jump down my throat claiming I am saying all results are mistakes, I am not.  I am performing experiments, keeping an open mind, and considering all evidence I find.
&gt; 
&gt; The way you have been attacking me by calling me names at every turn, just because I try new things and don&#x27;t always agree with your world view, is eerily reminiscent of the way the church of old tried to suppress new thought and discoveries, except you&#x27;re just substituting the word &#x27;heretic&#x27; with &#x27;science&#x27;. and &#x27;blasphemy&#x27; with anything that disagrees with you.
&gt; 
&gt; There&#x27;s an old saying:  &quot;We become that which we hate&quot;.  So far, all you&#x27;ve done is denounce people&#x27;s efforts to try new methods and see what works.  You accept nothing anyone else proposes if it does not agree with you.  That is the realm of the extreme skeptic: the same skeptic you ridicule.
&gt; 
&gt; You certainly don&#x27;t have to agree with my comments.  And I don&#x27;t have to agree with yours.  But no one needs all the name calling Frank.   It really adds nothing to support your theories.

&gt;  Yeah I know, science no accept anecdotes. There is plenty of hard evidence, trouble, science don&#x27;t accept that either cuz they are taught, no spirits, so there are no sprit voices, fact is fact is facts. Well that&#x27;s about all there is in this field. Perhaps you should take bird watching or something concrete. To not accept what others say is the same as calling us all liars, and I find very insulting.
&gt; 
&gt;  How irrational is it to ignore all evidence and continuously try to fit the phenomon into a diffintion where it will not fit and does not belong, and then claim you&#x27;re looking for a more rational explantation, it just does not make sense. I say forget the BS &quot;science&quot; whatever that is, puts out and try thinking on your own.  Mr Spock was a fictional charactor!

&gt;  If you completely ignore what everyone else in the whole wide freaking world gets via EVP, various photography and ITC methods, and just chance encounters, then yeah, you probably don&#x27;t have any data, and won&#x27;t have any data no matter what.

&gt; I don&#x27;t think I have enough data yet to make any conclusions, so I plan more experiments.  Since there are different distinct claims about what the box or the recorders can do, I try to make different distinct experiments for each.
&gt; 
&gt; Some people claim they can get the box to tell them things that the operator couldn&#x27;t know, so my &quot;whats the object&quot; experiment is one way to examine that.  Some people claim the boxes can make predictions, so cataloging predictions and examining the results can help examine that.  If there are other claims, I will try to figure experiments based on those.

&gt;  I get our last dogs from time to time, and used to get them via white noise when I first started this. Last summer some kids came down into the basement wiht the younger grandson, and the little yorkie barked, but &quot;get outta here&quot; came out, some how.
&gt; 
&gt;  Yeah, I think I was too hard on RJ. I don&#x27;t know why, but testing doens&#x27;t seem to work, but we get enough to prove this to ourselves. It&#x27;s probably a faith thing, although I&#x27;m not religious, even anti-religion.

&gt; Here is a short file, where someone says, &quot;Scamp, Scamp,&quot; then Scamp barks. &quot;yap.&quot;  This little dog belonged to my grandma, when I was about 9 or 10 years old, he was a Manchester Terrier, and lived with us for many years, and this is his bark for sure.  I&#x27;d know that bark anywhere.  Sorry, that I can&#x27;t make it any clearer, I need to get one of those better ghost boxes I guess.  RJ, spirits are just like us, they are not omnipresent like God,  probably why David doesn&#x27;t want to play the guessing game, he has better things to do over there, and has said, they have thousands of people standing in this long line waiting to get into the Heavens, and He can&#x27;t just drop His job and go to your house to see what you have over there, He did tell me that first time what it was, and i sent it to you, but it was too late.  It&#x27;s hard for me to understand them sometimes, He was also right about that little boy, Syler being killed, and where his body would be found, I don&#x27;t know what they did about it though. sf
