Dangers which Mankind faces if SPIRICOM is not used wisely\n\nSince his beginnings, Man has been faced with the fact that\nindividually and collectively he has the power to act for good or\nevil. As his knowledge of the energetic nature of the cosmos has\nexpanded, Man has found that every energy so far identified -- from\nsexual energy to atomic energy -- can be used for his benefit or for\nhis downfall. He will find that the energies involved in SPIRICOM are\nalso of a nature that can be used to help him grow mentally and\nspiritually and become more God-like (that is more like the beings on\nthe higher planes) or they can be focused on trivia which will make it\neven harder for him to grow out of the present deplorable mess in\nwhich Western civilization&#39;s social, economic and political actions\nare tending toward disintegration.\n\n----------------\n\n* For the spiritually oriented, we report some advice given by\nhigh level spirit communicators: If SPIRICOM researchers adhere to the\nfollowing procedure they will not suffer possession by negative\nforces. First thing in the morning say, &quot;I will wear the protective\ncloak of the Christ light until I retire tonight.&quot; On retiring make a\nsimilar decree for the night hours.
