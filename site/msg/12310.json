I have been having a heckuva time on ebay\ntrying to find a receiver with digital tuning and a decent size knob.\nUsually the volume knobs on tuners are massive, but only a smaller\nknob or two buttons for tuning are present. Guess I was a bit spoiled\nwith the larger VFO type tuners of my long gone HF transceivers.\nThanks for the heads up and saving me a buck.\n\nAndy\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Andy,\n&gt; \n&gt; It doesn&#39;t manual tune like you think, the knob is big but only goes \n&gt; a 1/4 turn to the left and right.  It scans like all the others \n&gt; though, i sold it on ebay after i hacked it.  It was more of a \n&gt; challenge than anything for me, but i didn&#39;t need another radio.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ourobouros2k2&quot; &lt;ourobouros2k2@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My wife is starting to look at me funny when I pull up \n&gt; &gt; radioshack.com &#39;cause she knows what&#39;s coming.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have seen where Steve reports that this mod is pretty difficult \n&gt; &gt; (getting to the mute wire) and, like him, I love a good challenge. \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; was wondering though, if anyone has used this modded radio \n&gt; regularly \n&gt; &gt; and can give opinions on it&#39;s performance stacked up against a 12-\n&gt; 469 -\n&gt; &gt; 470 or 20-125. Looks like a more robust design, and that tuner knob \n&gt; &gt; looks like a great candidate for manual tuning as well. Any \n&gt; thoughts?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Andy\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
