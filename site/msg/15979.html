The only way to prove 100% that something you receive through the box is au=
thentic communication, is if they say something that you can verify, someth=
ing you yourself did not know.

    I have gotten =
many life like voices over the years. My first evp was my mothers voice and=
 no boxes were involved. The box is a tool/method and there are many ways t=
o get their voices heard. So in the different methods I have used, yes I ha=
ve heard voices that resemble their lifetime charachteristics and tones. Is=
 it always that way? No. 

        Most often the group will speak as one v=
oice because I have requested they do so. One voice tone will begin a sente=
nce and another will end it. So I may hear my female friends voice start of=
f a thought and an unknown male voice finish the sentence. And vice versa o=
ften they speak in tones which do not even come close to what they sounded =
like in life. Quite often they are spirits I didnt know in life. I may get =
someone saying This is edison, and then find an old recording he did where =
he starts it off saying This is edison, but for me I do not know the man so=
 there is no recognition for me. I document it and file it away as a curiou=
sity.

        I always laugh when people say thats not your mother or frie=
nd thats something trying to fool you and mess with your head. I knew my mo=
ther longer than anyone and its interesting that it is easier for those peo=
ple to believe that its possible that something/someone else is speaking pr=
etending to be my mother but its much harder for them to believe that quite=
 possibly that really is my mother keeping her promise to stay in touch aft=
er death. If one is possible then so is the other. I tend to be stubborn in=
 some respects in that I dont instantly believe what anyone tells me whethe=
r living or not. If they give me a message I think is dumb I am very reluct=
ant to pass it on and usually those are the ones that get the biggest confi=
rmations tho it means nothing to me at the time. So yes quite possibly evp =
work can be used the same as mediumship in missing persons cases.

        =
For me tone of voice has grown to mean nothing. It is a treat when they man=
age to come across sounding as they did when in physical form here but I lo=
ok beyond the tone of voice. Often people get a childs voice and they becom=
e saddened by the thought that a child is earthbound. But I see it just as =
a representation of voice and whether it comes across as male female child =
or robot matters little to me.

        I do find they often resume the "ch=
aracter" they played because after all that is sort of what we are, charact=
ers in some giant play. Whether it is the beliefs they had which were their=
 trademark, the tone of voice, their image, or use of some nickname even I =
dont know about I look at it all as just a pixel in a larger portrait that =
some part survives once the body has ceased to function. And the message is=
 simply, our energy continues on.

          I was g=
oogling about AM radio reception, and I came across the below exchange on a=
 forum. It talks about using the box to find missing persons (which I didn'=
t know was possible), and the conversation mentions hearing specific voice =
inflections and recognizing a dead person's specific voice on the box. My q=
uestion is, do any of you get a recognizable voice? The voices I get always=
 sound robotic, although I do get clearly male or female voices.
