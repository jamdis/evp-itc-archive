<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I swore I would not get wraped up in this debate



BUT!



The reason I came up with this whole protection ritual was that some 
of the new researchers where

expressing a rational concern for negative responces that they were 
recieving through thier boxes.



The short protection ritual that I posted is not meant to quell 
irrational histerical fear, and I agree

with rosemary that anyone suffering from such fear should rethink 
thier involment in the paranormal research field.



that being said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal comfort 
to those new individuals that had never 

expperienced spiritual negativity. And to help ease them into 
aproaching a session eventually with confidence

and determination as well as full curiousity for all types of the 
communication we recieve.



My initial post of the ritual file was done with the best of 
intentions and meant to be another tool available for those who felt 

they needed or wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer 
ritual, I don&#x27;t think it is really worthy of all this debate.



Use it, don&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s there if you want it. Also I must say 
there are two kinds of fear the kind that is natural and a god 

given emotion for self preservation, ie the fright and flight reflex 
that is an instinctive trait in all of us. Then you have the 

irrational dibilitating phobic fear that can turn an individual into 
a frozen statue. That type of fear I believe is unhealthy

and should be addressed and dealt with and learned how to harness. I 
also believe that anyone that harbors that type of fear 

would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a case of such 
fear it would already be present and doing a small protection 

ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take it for what it is, 
something to utilize in our box of tools like an emf meter.



you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the bottom of your tool 
box at home that you inherited from your grandfather and have never 
used

but if you come across that odd nut that needs tightening somedsy you 
will be glad you have it.
