<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>So far I got one to work, replacing the mechanical cap with varactors. the last three no work. I had some luck with an AM/FM Suntone radio, but could only get a few stations on the high end of the AM band. 

 The one MV1650 I had worked the best, but those run about 12 bucks each, when I could find them.
 The cost of the tuning diode are much more expensive than buying a digital radio and using an externmal sweep voltage.
