<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t know the bible, just repeat what I heard/read somewhere. Mostly it sounds just like the 72 virgin thing. All the time in the world--two years! That&#x27;s what I meant.

&gt;  Yeah, I know &quot;rapture&quot; isn&#x27;t in Bible, however, &quot;resurrection is&quot; that&#x27;s the word the spirit&#x27;s are using mostly.  Yep, we do have all the time in the world right now, but even 1000 when ya think about it really isn&#x27;t very long.  I don&#x27;t think anyone really knows the date, the world is going to be made fresh, and we should all have body&#x27;s that don&#x27;t brake down, you will know who you are, from what I&#x27;ve heard we&#x27;ll have a youthful look, and be able to get around really well.  Just don&#x27;t count the chickens until the eggs have hatched  :)    sf

&gt;                                               So if you&#x27;re not Christian, you have all the time in the world?
&gt;  
&gt;  Yeah, I get some saying it&#x27;s this month, or next month, or August, or October. I&#x27;ll stick with December 2012, and even that I&#x27;m not taking to the bank.
&gt;  
&gt;  FYI, rapture ain&#x27;t in the bible. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be stuck in/with this body --forever--wrong frikin&#x27; gender! And species.

&gt;  &gt; Great file Frank!  Says, &quot;time on earth&quot; then a different person says,  &quot;is 
&gt;  &gt; it?&quot;  They are talking about the limited time we are going to be here  now, 
&gt;  &gt; if you are Christian and believe, you will be taken up, body and all,  
&gt;  &gt; believers will be the only ones that see Him in the sky, our physical body will  
&gt;  &gt; be changed, and it won&#x27;t hurt, the sensation will fell like when someone  
&gt;  &gt; stretches, the adrenalin will kick in, we disappear to others around us, and 
&gt;  &gt; up  we go!  I am told it will be soon now, all I got to say is,   Yikes!  sf

&gt;  &gt; Yeah, just listen to the music. This is from a couple days ago  using that 
&gt;  &gt; Suntone radio. Yeah, I know, it&#x27;s one of those messags assembled  from 
&gt;  &gt; frags, but &quot;they&quot; did the assembling!
