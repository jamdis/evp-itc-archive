<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi &quot;wolf&quot; good to hear from you. Just to send a quick note to help you get started. I would suggest looking for a Sony ICD-B7 digital recorder. You can find these on eBay from $5 to $25 (depends on your luck) I purchased one last week for about $12 and $8 shipping (used) then next day found 2 NEW for near $15 each ($9 combined shipping) I purchased both these too.I now have 4 of them...so that says something. Well to get to my point...they are really good at collecting EVP voices. I also have a DR60 but my Sony&#x27;s kick in every once in awhile and get more than the DR60 sometimes. Try one of the B7&#x27;s and I&#x27;m set on saying I&#x27;m positive you will get some evp. You will need a patch cable to connect to PC (important to use pc to help find the evp...along with free download of Audacity).You will need the patch cable to be 1/8&quot; mono male to 1/8&quot; stereo male (or a full stereo patch cable with an adapter to allow the MONO output from B7 to be converted to an imitation stereo signal for pc (without and you will end up with a mono output at PC (only one speaker or headphone will work). The mono/stereo patch cable or added adapter make listening with headphones easier (MUST use headphones)!! As many of these voices are very weak as you may know. Oh....did I say I was going to make this a &quot;quick note&quot; Hehehe--- never mind ;) Good Luck!!!! And have FUN.    -- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;blueeyedwolf1977&quot; &lt;sellington3629@...&gt; wrote:

&gt; Hello all! I have been a member of this group for a little while now, and I finally have a question..lol..
&gt; 
&gt; I have always been interested in EVP work, but have never really had the opportunity to &quot;try for myself&quot;...I am soo far from mechanically inclined it isn&#x27;t funny, and don&#x27;t have alot of money to spend...
&gt; 
&gt; Are there any suggestions on what I can do to start out maybe? Something cheap? That is easy to use? I have an old &#x27;Realistic&#x27;
&gt; cassette recorder with variable speech control ( pitch and speed controls)...is this anything that I can experiment with? Will it work (even for now until I can afford something better? lol)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance all!!
