The only way I would ever "help" a ghost is by telling it that it has the p=
ower to find a way out the predicament itself.

            <P>I was invited to spend the night in the West V=
irginia 
            Penitentiary this past weekend... I was asked to give =
a short 
            demonstration with my Optimus 12-797 hacked radio. Dee=
p inside the 
            prison surrounded by concrete and steel, the radi=
o could not pick up 
            any radio stations in manual mode. I wasn'=
t sure how this might 
            effect the demonstration. I was pleasant=
ly surprised with the 
            results. I recorded the session and the =
results can be heard at this 
            link. <A title=3Dhttp://www.youtu=
