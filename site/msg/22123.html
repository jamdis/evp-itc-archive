<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>&quot;I am not hear to bash anyone, and I do not expect that myself.  I am sorry you
feel the way you do Frank, but you are entitled to feel how ever you want.  If
you would like to continue bashing, I can meet you blow for blow technically and
I know I will win.&quot;

 I can only guess at where you get that shit, but as usual, always some egomaniac that knows better. Fuck it!! I&#x27;m outta here too. It&#x27;s either that or start banning all these jerkfucks. Not one iota of respect, don&#x27;t ask me anything, just claim y&#x27;all are so much better, so much smarter. Don;&#x27;t make any suggestion to imopreove it,  Just claim how bad my design is, and how you have rework the whole thing--for your research. No doubt, sitting in the dark yelling at a box.

&gt; This video explains all the features of the box.  So, get some popcorn and enjoy.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the first box to have shack hack modes as well as linear and random adjustable sweeps.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, the only box other than the &quot;Minibox&quot; to have a working random circuit in it.
