Two (of the four of us) at the table wanted a message from a particular person.  The Ghost Radar began saying things, including several words that -- to me -- clearly indicated the painting on the wall next to us.  \n\n(When I&#39;m not being a researcher/author, I&#39;m an artist, so I&#39;d noticed the painting&#39;s subject, medium, artist&#39;s name, date, etc.)\n\nThe two people hadn&#39;t looked closely at the painting.  However, when they did, they felt that it included exactly the kind of message they were looking for.\n\nWhat most impressed me were their reactions.  Both are fairly accustomed to paranormal phenomena and the ways that people convince themselves that whatever-it-is is actually a message.\n\nHowever, this incident seemed to have significance to them, and satisfied them that they&#39;d rec&#39;d the message they were looking for.\n\nIt&#39;s just anecdotal and just one incident, but... well, there it is.  I think the Ghost Radar is worth exploring if you already have a droid or similar tool.  And, for the price... well, hey, why not!\n\nI&#39;ll experiment with it more when I actually own something it&#39;ll run on.  For now, other research is a higher priority.\n\nCheerfully,\nFiona\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Timbo&quot; &lt;timbo1138@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I started a group about Ghost Radar App. If you use it come by and check it out.
