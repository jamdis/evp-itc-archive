Recording timer was sticking for up to 5 seconds, then continue without adding the seconds...very loud splatter (loud sounds) where heard while I played it back over speaker in the field. Also the REC led symbol was flashing on and off...it is supposed to stay on while recording. After replacing batteries with NO help, I told this &quot;mischievious deity&quot; to go AWAY. That worked. \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Jim%27s%20RR-DR60%20EVP%27s/get_out_of_my_face-evp.mp3 \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles\n\nRegards,\n\nclockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt;"}
