Greetings fellow researchers,

I normally don&#x27;t get into petty matters such as the following, but an 
individual (Bruce Halliday) who was banned from this forum is asking 
me to stop my claim of being the originator of the hack of the 12-470.
He wants me to remove that claim from my website, etc.
Bruce&#x27;s e-mail to me was one of surprise.
Why... it was on this very forum that Bruce admitted that his 
attempted hack of the 12-470 did not work, after I had shared my 
success with all of you.
I&#x27;ve included the forum messages from last year with their date and 
time stamps. The messages are still right here on this forum.
Bruce says he hacked the radio first and then posted his hack on his 
website.
But, as you can see in the following messages, Bruce told me his 
attempt did not work, posting this after my hack.

I would not even mention this if Bruce&#x27;s e-mail to me wasn&#x27;t so 
threatening...  I just wanted to get the record straight.

Okay... I spent the money :-) and yes, it (the 12-470) can be
modified to sweep the AM, FM, TV, and Wx bands. I just completed the
mod on the 12-470. Unlike the 12-469, the 12-470 has a built in
speaker too!
I&#x27;ll post a video of me doing both the 12-469 mod and the 12-470 mod.

Thanks..

mike,
 
I just modified the 12-470 myself and do not have fm signal
my model has the tape wires sotered to the board and not the pins.
the am works fine but no fm just static. does your fm work?
