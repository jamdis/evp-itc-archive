In tried  \n&gt; re-working it to salvage it, but i&#39;m disappointed with the outcome.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The radio itself is just crappy and there is nothing more i can do.   The \n&gt; circuit and parts are all new, so i know that the radio is the  problem.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If anybody wants this, they can have it for $30 plus shipping.  First  \n&gt; person to contact me will get it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It only works on AM, the FM sounds like garbage.  If nobody wants it,  i \n&gt; will just use it for parts, no big deal.\n&gt;  \n&gt; -Steve\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Steve Hultay\n&gt; _www.keyportparanormal.com_ (http://www.keyportparanormal.com/) \n&gt; _http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/_ \n&gt; (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/) \n&gt; _www.stevehultay.com_ (http://www.stevehultay.com/) \n&gt; _www.rtscresearch.org_ (http://www.rtscresearch.org/)\n&gt;"}
