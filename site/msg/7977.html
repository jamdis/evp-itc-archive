Im not gettin anywhere either...the Lakhota people I know all believe that ghosts, spirits, etc. are a bad thing, a bad omen, bad sign, death, etc...I didnt realize this otherwise I would have just asked for a translation claiming that a friend said it or something.  Im gonna ask around some more tho...without the part that it may have come from a spirit. Let ya know if I find out anything.

it's close to thte center of the AM band, and that's mostly Spanish 
stations--There is also a couple NPR stations. 

I asked a guy at work that is pretty much a life long practicioner 
of Lakota religion, and he's never heard of "wu-tonka".

not...sounds like it...Tonka I believe is buffalo...but I think it 
can be a different word depending on whats used before the word and 
after.
