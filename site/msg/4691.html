No sniping needed! There were no thorns in my words. A lot of expression is lost or misunderstood in email, if you took offense to anything I wrote, it was not meant that way. I agree most people in the paranormal community (The Ghost Hunter generation) do not have the understanding to grasp what we as a group are saying. I have had endless arguments with paranormal investigators over this very subject. Is it real or is it delusional rhetoric? To my knowledge no one has ever won that argument on either side of the coin. They say prove it, we say disprove it! With that being said, I am not a box researcher, I am an ITC researcher. I use many methods to obtain the messages I get because the message, not the equipment is what's important.

Potential researchers will make their way to us at their own pace because we cannot force people to 'get it'. The connection we share with our spirit friends is through our hearts and spirits. Its a positive attitude, pure intent, desire and the will to communicate that allows those switches to be flipped in our minds.

I agree with you totally Bruce. We need more and more people with the above mentioned attributes in this world let alone this field of research. Can we ever prove to anyone that this is real? No! Can we show them it is real? We can try! People may call me a defeatist for not promoting or defending ITC, but I don't think so. My original goal is not to convince the world that this is real. If they are supposed to "get it", they will.

Best Regards,

Frank R.

Frank,

 

This only becomes an issue when new people get interested in our research and seek information from the usual paranormal community and are met with these type of answers and explanations. They quickly become disinterested and whenever anyone may mention box research in the future they convey the same closed minded ignorance that was spewed to them on their initial quest for answers.

 

Not to mention that anyone that does any serious research in this medium would I'm sure like to have their efforts recognised as being legitimate in their source and taken seriously with respect. not  dismissed as nonsense or something that is written off as fake or delusional. 

 

Frank I don't want to start a long thread with all different people sniping back and forth I posted that snip it of a blog to let everyone know what the general consensus of our research is. And I did not even mention who the blog was actually about but I'm sure we all can guess. It's that kind of stupidity that stops us from getting new potential researchers involved and adding their positive energy to our own, I have received messages from our friends on the other side that instruct that the more individuals that are involved and think positively about the communication we are striving to achieve, the stronger the communication will get. I view this blog attitude as not a personal attack on what I am particularly doing but just another extremely large hurtle to get over in bringing this amazing form of spirit communication to the forefront of paranormal research.

Why would this be an issue? I am not doing this to convince others of the validity of my messages. If someone wants to learn how, I will teach them. If someone has questions I will answer them to the best of my ability. If someone is skeptical it is a distraction from my goals to try and convince them that something is real. Its pointless to try and convince or prove the reality of a practice that is so highly subjective and mostly personal.

Regards,

Frank R.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] we have a hard row to hoe



This statement was taken from a blog that was sent to me by steve. He 
came across it while web surfing.

It is indicitive of the attitude 90% of the paranormal community has 
toward box evp research.

I suggest we all memorise it because as box researchers this will be 
our most formitable object.

The first thought that comes to mind about this whole 'box' thing is 
what are the chances that spirits would comunicate through such a box. 
I mean there are so many different radio frequencies the chances that 
anything would or would want to use the am or fm bands seems very 
unlikely.
