I\ndon&#39;t think that is the case at all. i still don&#39;t have a problem with\nyou either. all i ever wanted to do is talk about the research you\nwere doing.\n\nI now have 2 frank&#39;s boxes (the GHOSTMAN 3 and FB#33) to do my\nresearch. (btw.. i thanks you a bunch already frank.. so thank you again)\n\nSteve, you come across as an expert is all i am saying. that is why i\ncontacted you. &quot;boxmaster estraordinaire&quot; is it? For you to say &quot;who\nis this guy?&quot; and cause problems for a mutual friend is absurd. so..\nfor you and everyone to know a little about me...\n\noct 22 i turn 33 years old. I have been interested in the box\ntechnology for a few years now. i have been doing paranormal\ninvestigations for 19 years now and took a 3 year break (which is when\nyou popped up on the scene.) Now i&#39;m back and hitting it hard again\nand want to be able to use the best equipment that money can&#39;t buy.\n\nFrank doesn&#39;t even pretend to be an expert nor does he expect his name\nto be mentioned every time an article is published. anyways.. i\nprobably said more than i should have already.\n\nbear... i&#39;m up for that duel.. sounds fun...lol best one wins a\n&quot;certificate of expertification&quot; sign by the us president...lol\n\nbtw.. one rule bear... no cutting and pasting clips together to make\none up. haha\n\n--jon\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I never claimed to be the first on the RS hack, i just posted the \n&gt; first files from it.

No recording duels here, nobody cares anyway.  \n&gt; What would that serve?

I&#39;ve also heard\n&gt; &gt; your files. So? Nothing I haven&#39;t heard before,\n&gt; &gt; but as always I enjoy listening to everyone&#39;s efforts.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What I don&#39;t like is an attitude and egomania\n&gt; &gt; when it comes to this research.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Next I guess you&#39;ll challenge me to a recording\n&gt; &gt; duel? LOL.

You obviously\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know me, but dislike me. That&#39;s ok, i like to get along with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people; it helps the research move forward. I would love to hear \n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of your files from your frank&#39;s boxes and compare notes on what \n&gt; we&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been getting.
