I used the phrase "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" in Stefan's evpmaker and have had interesting results including some live. I tried other pangrams (contain every letter of english alphabet) but the one I felt drawn to use was the one that has had the best results.
   
  No two sessions are ever alike and as background sound its easily modulated into quite complicated sentences and word structures.

that would definately be nice and very good.
