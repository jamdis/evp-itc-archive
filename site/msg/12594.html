<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello everyone. I am a member of your group, but also have my own
group consisting of people that work to assist law
enforcement/missing person organizations using their radios or
psychic/medium skills.

I am looking for volunteers to record with deceased victims to try
and help solve cases managed by Nancy Angelbound.

These are cold case files.

Anyone interested, please join my site and go to the links page to
see the cases. http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/SDWR-
SpeakingToTheDeadWithRadios/?yguid=338683728

We ask you send your files to Nancy directly to ensure this
information does not leak into public hands possibly causing harm to
the family or police investigation.

Nancy Angelbound will work with you directly and she will get the
info you provide to proper authorities.

For your personal reward, you help the victim find closure, the
family find closure and law enforcement close the case.

Please accept my invitation to help those in need, and thanks in
advance.

Mike Edwards</pre>
