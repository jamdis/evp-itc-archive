So, I let the session run on its own and sent him the raw\nfile.Well, sure enough, it is working just fine. I had some static and\nlearned to move the radio around to a better spot.But amazingly one of\nthe messages was &quot; I want to see Bruce !&quot;You can hear it clear as day.\nAlso, I got some vulgar messages and I wonder about this. When Debbie\ndid a session with me in the beginning she got some eye opening\nmessages for me. One was &quot;cut the bull ----&quot;. Debbie said that can&#39;t\nbe !!! but it was right on !!! we were trying to contact my mom and\nthat was one of her favorite sayings here !!! LOLHowever, the messages\nBruce recovered in my session were a little more vulgar and not\nsomething from my mom.I also had events in the house after starting\nrecording sessions.The RS box would go on by itself, not while I was\nhome, and I live alone. This happened several times, the third time I\ncame home my computerized clothes dryer locked it&#39;s control panel, the\nRS was on and my wireless router needed to be reset. I now need help\nwith Audacity or sound booth. I don&#39;t know how to use it to clean the\nbackground noise up.Thanks again Bruce (I hope you don&#39;t mind my\nposting !!??)Holly \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Pack up or back upuse SkyDrive to transfer files or keep extra\ncopies.
