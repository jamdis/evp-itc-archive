Yes, I agree, we have to start somewhere.

If I could, I would. But Hubby w=

        Just testing with me (my one lonely data point) is =
not as subjective as one person asking their board open-ended questions, bu=
t I agree it is also not as objective as it could be with more people, or p=
erhaps more randomized data sources.

        So while I still have my one =
data point test open to anyone who would like to test their board, we can a=
lso add future tests, with other people, or other "answer" sources.  That w=
ould add to the reliability of the performance statistics, while collecting=
 more data.

        But I think it's best to do one test at a time, yes?  =
So, might as well begin with mine, for those who are so inclined to begin t=
esting, and then see where we go from there.

          "Asking the board open-ended que=
stions, and interpreting the results, is subjective. Asking for a specific,=
 predetermined number is not subjective.  It is about as objective as you c=
an get."

          Your test is subjective in that it is based on just you=
r influence. Therefore, all we can test with it is your influence on the bo=
ard. Add a few more people to the study, then we can objectify it a little =
more.

          In the second paragraph, the test you outlined with testin=
g the 2 people, is not subjective, because you have more then just one pers=
on. It would even be better with a few more test subjects.


          "My =
test is not for those who believe it is statistically likely that psychic t=
ampering would occur, or that the board=E2=80=99s performance is just not t=
estable, which is the camp I gather you are in."

          Not at all. I d=
o not have any opinion either way if the board can or can't be psychically =
influence, because I do not know. I do think the board can be tested for ce=
rtain things. I just don't think your test using just you would tell us muc=
h in the grand scheme of things. This is not meant to pick on you in any wa=
y, I do think it the test you have proposed would be interesting.

                  Asking the board open-ended questions, and=
 interpreting the results, is subjective. Asking for a specific, predetermi=
ned number is not subjective.  It is about as objective as you can get. 

 =
                 I am not trying to prove anything, or rule out any possibi=
lities.  I am suggesting a method to determine, statistically, how accurate=
 someone=E2=80=99s board, or methodology, might be.  Lets say I select two =
people, and in separate rooms, I give each a spelling test.  Person 1 gets =
100% right.  Person 2 gets 50% right.  Now, if I later give them a second s=
pelling test, I can start with the theory that Person 1 will get near 100% =
correct, and Person 2 will get near 50% correct.  This doesn=E2=80=99t mean=
 they will, or that they have gotten these scores in the past.  But statist=
ically, it is a reasonable assumption at this point.  After the second test=
, I can examine the deviation of the results from the first test, and updat=
e the statistics.   If the deviation remains small (if the results remain s=
imilar), then I can more and more safely assume that person 1 will have a v=
ery high chance of getting a word right, and person 2 will have half that. =
 If the deviation swings wildly, than my statistics may not be very predict=
ive after all.

                  The same is true with the board.  As you =
said, getting this number wrong doesn=E2=80=99t say past answers were wrong=
, or that future answers will be wrong.  And it is possible it could have b=
een right by mere chance (though very unlikely: winning the lottery is more=
 likely than guessing one number out of a billion).  What we=E2=80=99d have=
 is one single objective data point.  It gives a starting point for reasona=
ble assumptions.  As you noted, after more such tests, those assumptions ma=
y start changing.  It would be interesting to see how they change, if they =
do.

                  Different people seem to have different feelings abo=
ut the board.  Some believe it gives great results.  Some are suspicious, e=
ven dubious.  And there are plenty of opinions in between.  My test is not =
for those who believe it is statistically likely that psychic tampering wou=
ld occur, or that the board=E2=80=99s performance is just not testable, whi=
ch is the camp I gather you are in.  My test is only good for that segment =
of this population who believes or wonders if the board is capable of givin=
g a straight objective answer to a straight objective questions, and that s=
uch performance is testable.  To address one of your examples, while it can=
not show that an entity is reading my mind if it gets the numbers right, it=
 can conversely show that an actual entity is not reading my mind (or that =
it is not performing remote viewing, or that it is not predicting the futur=
e of what the right answer is when it is revealed, or that it is not being =
forthright in its answers) if it cannot get the numbers right in the first =
place.  But if these things are true, then it begs the question of its accu=
racy anyway.

                  So again, this is one data point, in what c=
ould be a number of tests, for those who are not ruling out that testing is=
 possible, and even desirable, when believing, or acting on, information ga=
thered by using this kind of board.

              =
      It's not that I don't want to test it, it is that I can't. It would b=
e interesting and I would do it if I could.

                    But again,=
 this test could really only rule out psychic interference from you. It is =
too subjective and therefore cannot stand as a measurement for other tests =
of this nature by itself.

                    If it failed to get your num=
ber, that would not mean that it couldn't get someone else's number or that=
 someone else couldn't influence it. That would also not mean that answers =
it had gotten in the past weren't correct, coming from a living being or a =
spirit.  It would not prove anything, except that it was not acting on any =
psychic vibrations from you personally.

                    If it got your=
 number correct, that doesn't even help immediately, because it could get t=
he answer on mere chance.

                    The only way to prove here t=
hat it is being psychically influenced would be to run several tests of the=
 same nature. Then, if it scored correct higher then mere chance, only then=
 could you say that the board can be psychically tampered with. Still, that=
 is the only thing you could say for certain. That would not rule out the p=
ossibility that spirits can communicate through it.

                     S=
o we would be left with more questions. Is it that it is being psychically =
tampered with by a human mind directly? Is it and actual entity reading som=
eone's mind? Can it be both?

                    See what I am sayin'?

                  someone=E2=80=99s board, or methodology, =
might be.  Lets say I 
                  select two people, and in sep=
arate rooms, I give each a 
                  spelling test.  Person 1=
 gets 100% right.  Person 2 
                  gets 50% right.  N=
ow, if I later give them a second 
                  spelling test, I can s=
tart with the theory that Person 1 will 
                  get near 100% co=
rrect, and Person 2 will get near 50% 
                  correct.  Thi=
s doesn=E2=80=99t mean they will, or that they have 
                  gott=
en these scores in the past.  But statistically, it 
                 =
 is a reasonable assumption at this point.  After the 
               =
   second test, I can examine the deviation of the results from 
          =
        the first test, and update the statistics.   If the 
    =
              deviation remains small (if the results remain similar), then=
 
                  I can more and more safely assume that person 1 will ha=
ve a 
                  very high chance of getting a word right, and perso=
n 2 will 
                  have half that.  If the deviation swings w=

                  statistics may not be very predictive aft=
er all.<BR><BR>The 
                  same is true with the board.  As=

 past answers were wrong, or that 
                  future answers will be=

                  winning the lott=
ery is more likely than guessing one number

lion).  What we=E2=80=99d have is one single 
                  object=

                  reas=

                  =
tests, those assumptions may start changing.  It would be 
           =
       interesting to see how they change, if they

s.  Some are suspicious, even dubious.  And 
                  th=

    for those who believe it is statistically likely that psychic

          tampering would occur, or that the board=E2=80=99s performance is=

 show that an entity is reading
