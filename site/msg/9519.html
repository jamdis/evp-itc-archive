Hey Jeremy,
   
  Thanks for sharing your experience with me and everyone and Im sorry for your loss....its tough to lose anyone let alone someone you are close to and unexpectedly.  
   
  Something else I remembered.....I just lost my mom this past Feb and because of my sister being selfish and keeping her nursing home a secret from me I hadnt gotten a chance to see her before she passed...but I have this email addy I rarely check, its one I mostly use if Im sending away for freebies...but something told me, nagged at me, to check THAT email on the 21st....so I did.  I had gotten an email from my sister letting me know that mom had passed and that I was "more than welcome" to attend her funeral which was a few days later.....I could have missed that but someone wanted me to know...someone nagged at me to check my email....I hadnt checked it in months so there were hundreds of spam emails but the one from my sister was right there on the first page.(That by the way is my Ruckus email....and if you have gotten a chance to listen to my recordings so far one of them has one of our spirit friends calling my nick name, "Ruckus" in it.)
   
  Anyways I thought Id share that with ya'll too.
  Hope everyone is having a great weekend...going ok here so far...my b/f is making my birthday dinner tonight even tho its a couple days late....I cant wait to bite into a juicy steak and some sauteed mushrooms...mmmmmm!

            Hello Rhonda and Everyone,
   
  I have heard my name called out loud before, but it was not an EVP situation it was after my first girlfriend died. I was 17. She was 15. She had had her second kidney transplant a few months earlier and died of gas gangrene.
   
  She died at 3:15 PM and I felt it. I knew that she had died. It is very difficult to explain, but I knew that she was gone. So, it wasn't surprising to me when I got home from school and my eldest sister was on the phone telling my Mother that Rena had died.
   
  My Mother had moved us to Texas from Oklahoma a few months earlier. I knew that Rena wasn't doing good as she was before I left, but no one expected her to die. She made a turn for the worse late that morning and by 3:15 she was gone. 
   
  Late that afternoon I took the Greyhound bus back to my hometown in Oklahoma. When I got to my sisters house, it was around 1 am. My sister is 18 years older than me, so I have a niece that is a year younger than me. My niece and I both heard Rena call my name and I then heard her call my name again a little later before I went to bed. That night after I had gone to sleep, it woke me up as I felt someone sit on the side of my bed. I knew it was Rena telling me she was okay, but this was before I knew anything about the paranormal, so I was a bit scared to open my eyes and see her. 
   
  She was my first love and I am hoping that I will hear from her someday via EVP/ITC.
   
  I consider myself very blessed to of heard her call my name and sit beside me to let me know she was okay. 
   
  Wishing everyone a wonderful weekend.
