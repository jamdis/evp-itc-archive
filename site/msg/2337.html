Good morning all,
   
      I have used this meter with great success as well as with great dismay.  I have had the meter "pennied down" sitting on a table top, and have a toy in another room respond to me without any activity on the meter.  I feel it is the spirit's choice and in which manner it feels more comfortable in communicating with you.  I have had lights turn off and back on again in succession in response to questions and no activity on the meter, and then I have had no other responses except the meter, so once again it is entirely up to the entity and how it wishes to respond.  In regards to the new apartment building, check the history of the land that it sits on.  In a few of my occasions it has been the energy tied to the land or former land owners that has caused the activity.  I have done an investigation in a "new construction" home site that the family had not moved into yet and the activity was on the increase, the new owners bought this piece of property as a wooded lot with
 no prior establishment being on site, to anyones knowledge that is.  To all of our surprise, land records had nothing available for that property other than the location and the pertinent info, however further research and many phone calls later it was discovered that the property sat on the edge of a local Indian tribal settlement from the 1700's (thanks to the Dept. of the Interior and the Bureau of Native American (Indian) Affairs.  It just goes to show you that persistence and continued research pays off in the long run ( this one took about 4 months to research).  So Travis just keep checking and get all you can on the property from as far back as you can, you never know what you might fond out.

Which was my point though. Im sure it can be used effectively to 
communicate, but anything can be used to communicate effictively as 
long as you stay objective and dont read too much into some things. 
So I was just suggesting if you have an emf detector already or other 
things available why buy something which is pretty much the same 
thing you have already. Ive noted that some electronic toys work very 
well if there really is someone on the other side wanting to make 
contact badly enough. For instance right now I live in a brand new 
apartment building.
We just recently got rid of our house and moved into an apartment 
to save some money up. Usually I start wondering about the history of 
a house or an apartment when I first move in. Considering though this 
building and everything in it or on it are brand new as the building 
was just put up and we were the very first couple to live in this 
apartment. Which is a pretty cool fresh feeling, to be the first 
people to live in a place. So it never even ocurred to me to think 
about its history, since it has no history. Never-the-less after 
about 2 months of living there I start feeling things. Like Im being 
watched. It slowly progresses to actually seeing things out of the 
corner of my eyes, I shrug this off too. Then I actually seen a cat 
in my apartment it starts to come up to me, I kept my eyes on it 
nonstop and it just vanished right in front of me. I really thought 
that was the last straw I no doubt lost my mind.
Its not like I thought I saw it, its like it was really there then 
as it comes up to me it just vanishes. It looked completely solid, I 
thought how the heck did a stray cat get in my apartment. The same 
thing happened later but with a person, I was coming from the kitchen 
and seen a person walk down the hallway I run quickly to the hallway 
and nothing. I told my fiance about the cat, I didnt say nothing 
about the person because I dont want her to think Im crazy. The odd 
thing was that just the other day she said she seen some kind of 
animal run through our living room , when she went to find out what 
it was it was gone. Her experience was a bit different as she seen it 
cut in front of a doorway. I was standing in front of it and seen it 
just evaporate in front of my eyes. Anyway long story short I toy 
went off on its own across the room while holding my 4 month old 
daughter in my lap. (its an electronic toy with no remote control or 
motion sensor, you actually have to hit a button to set it off, so 
how it went off with no button being pressed was beyond me). So I 
said if there is anyone here set that toy off again, and sure enough 
within a second or less of my asking it did it again.
I asked if it can understand what Im saying to do it twice, and 
it did. By that time I was really intrigued and freaked out to say 
the least. I scrambled to find my video camera and it didnt do it 
while taping. I thought perhaps low batteries like some would 
suggest. Anyway feeling discouraged I went to the restroom and I can 
hear that toy go off again. Then as Im wondering if it might be that 
toys batters another toy in the living room starts to go off along 
with the first toy. How this is going on in a freshly built place 
where there has not been a house built on the same location before is 
beyond me, a portion of trees had to be cleared for these apartments. 
Perhaps the land itself, or a nearby house since there are a few from 
line of sight, no way for me to tell I guess. I completely lost track 
of my point, but there you have it.

meter will spike twice for yes, but I have no voice or image I would

meter is a very useful tool and I do not conduct an investigation or 
session without it by my side, but like the rest of the tools in this 
field it has its valuable points as well as negative points.
