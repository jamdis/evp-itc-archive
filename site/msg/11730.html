<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve got the paranormal puck from the same maker as the Ovilus.  It&#x27;s
pretty cool.  YOu can set it on scan, just like the r/s hack, and let it
phonetically put together words.  I&#x27;m still in the experimental stages,
but I&#x27;m very interested. I&#x27;m considering getting the Ovilus II when it is
avalaible.

&gt; I thought it was pretty neat that it repeated the word &quot;worry&quot; when
&gt; Ryan asked if it was worried they&#x27;d bring in a priest.
&gt; What are the odds of that just based on environmental readings? If I
&gt; had an extra $200 laying around I&#x27;d be buying myself one to play with.

&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know how many of the members watch Paranormal State, but they
&gt;&gt; used
&gt;&gt; a new piece of equipment called The Ovilus. You guys have got to check
&gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt; out. Go to www.digitaldowsing.com. I am not really sure who these guys
&gt;&gt; are,
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; where they came up with this. To me, it sounds kind of like Frank&#x27;s Box,
&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt; not the same.
&gt;&gt; Frank, please take a look at this, and tell us what  you think.
&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t understand how it works......
