<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think groups pretty much useless. Everyone has a damn opinion that is
gospel truth. Then the freaking skeptics- that no one can question when they
say this all imagination, and when we question them we are attacking. Figure
that crap out! Arrogant idiots. I&#x27;ve reached my saturation point, y&#x27;all can
have this shit.

&gt; attacked ?? Wow , how dramatic... It&#x27;s just a fact that you will make Frank
&gt; mad again.
&gt; For instance: IT is very obvious that when Frank gets something from the
&gt; box about
&gt; stuff that says what is going to happen, YOU have to say I will add that to
&gt; your predictions.
&gt; Those are not Frank&#x27;s predictions, he is just posting the messages, and it
&gt; is very clear
&gt; that he does not like you saying or posting that those are his
&gt; predictions.....
&gt; Maybe you should pick your words a little better in the future, or better
&gt; yet, maybe you should just
&gt; not say anything, and just put the info in your little files to save, and
&gt; no one would be
&gt; the wiser..
&gt; I&#x27;m tired of giving you so much time in this group, so I hope I don&#x27;t have
&gt; to ATTACK you anymore LOL

&gt;   BTW, if anyone is wondering what I am talking about, this was a good
&gt; example.
&gt; I offer a suggestion on getting things back on track with less hostility,
&gt; and I am immediately attacked for making the suggestion.

&gt; I expect none of us like all the recent attacks, insults, accusations,
&gt; threats, hurting of feelings, and attempts to piss people off.
&gt;
&gt; Can I suggest we stick to the purpose of the group: &quot;the discussion,
&gt; promotion, and developemnt of Electronic Voice Phenomenon, and Instrumental
&gt; Transcommunication methods and technologies as used in the communication
&gt; with spirit, and other entities.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; And that we go with Frank&#x27;s philosophy &quot;just take the approach, try
&gt; different methods, see what works.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; No more threats. No name calling, insults, or accusations. Just try to keep
&gt; a positive group attitude, be open that not everyone believes what everyone
&gt; else does, and that&#x27;s ok?
&gt;
&gt;
