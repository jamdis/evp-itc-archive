<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Steve, holy cow, you&#x27;re right, it says Margaret! That is interesting  
that you didn&#x27;t hear anything in my second clip. I had reversed my  
clip previously, but didn&#x27;t sounds like anything but backwards words.  
How did you do that?

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m attaching an EVP that I picked up last week. We could hear it in
&gt; person at the time, and it sounded like &quot;get out.&quot; Once I pulled it
&gt; into Audacity, it sounded completely different. Slowing it down 33%
&gt; makes it sound even more different. Any guesses? I haven&#x27;t done
&gt; anything to these files other than to slow the second version down a
&gt; bit. Deb T
