What happened was that during and after\nthe sageing the energy really kicked it up several notches.  I had placed\nmy emf meter on the end of my daughters bed.  While sageing, I felt an\nelectrical type feeling start up the back of my hands..going all the way\nto my chest.  At that time, the emf meter had a sustained, high reading.\nWe continued to sage, and the emf meter was just buried in its\nreadings....I left the house...leaving the emf meter on and placing a dvr\non the bed also....we came back a couple hours later...the emf was reading\nthe usual low reading, and upon playback of the dvr you could hear the\nbeeping of my emf meter go crazy for about 20 minutes..after which it did\nnot beep again.  So, I think the sageing actually stirred up the\nentity....\n\nCarol B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Carol, if you don&#39;t mind my asking, how did the sage and salt &quot;feed&quot; the\n&gt; energy?\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeremy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; From: Carol B. &lt;cbreck@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Friday, July 18, 2008 6:33:27 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] blue lighting\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, first, we saged and salted.  That really fed the energy to the point\n&gt; we had to leave the house for a few hours.  We did the same thing again\n&gt; and again.  Then, a friend in CA called and together, on the phone, we got\n&gt; rid of it.  You should have heard my emf meter beeping it&#39;s freaking head\n&gt; off while my friend sent his energy to get it to go.  I had it on the end\n&gt; of my daughters bed...where usually there is nothing to set it off.  Boy,\n&gt; did it ever react to the &quot;banishing&quot; for lack of a better word.  My friend\n&gt; in CA is a sensitive, and helped me a great deal..I am forever thankful\n&gt; for him.\n&gt;\n&gt; Carol B.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I apologize, I didn&#39;t know the extent of the matter, I also have a\n&gt;&gt; friend\n&gt;&gt; that had some nasty negative energy attach to them.  I know what he went\n&gt;&gt; through, and no one should have to go through that.  I glad to hear you\n&gt;&gt; got rid of it, and I hope it didn&#39;t hurt your daughter.  If you don&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; mind\n&gt;&gt; me asking how you got rid of it?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rees\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- On Fri, 7/18/08, Carol B. &lt;cbreck@elknet. net&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From: Carol B. &lt;cbreck@elknet. net&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] blue lighting\n&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt;&gt; Date: Friday, July 18, 2008, 4:18 PM\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Actually, it was not cool at all! This spirit attached to my 23 year old\n&gt;&gt; daughter in a very hostile and perverted way. I have an evp I got in her\n&gt;&gt; room...I had asked, &quot;Why are you here?&quot; I got &quot; to f--k.&quot; in a very\n&gt;&gt; gutteral tone. It was awful. Thank God he is gone now and can never\n&gt;&gt; return.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Carol B.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; That sounds interesting, and Carol you said the spirit followed you\n&gt;&gt;&gt; home\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from Waverly... Thats cool, and I would try to get to know the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; energy/spirit.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- On Fri, 7/18/08, Carol B. &lt;cbreck@elknet. net&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Carol B. &lt;cbreck@elknet. net&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] blue lighting\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Date: Friday, July 18, 2008, 3:32 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Andrea,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I have experienced this before.

I am\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sorry\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have not written before but I have a terrible year and haven&#39;t had\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time to concentrate on EVP like I had prior. I won&#39;t get into the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; details\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but it\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has left me in the midst of OK just trying to pull through all of this\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BS\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I will get back to it when I can.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unfortunatley I am leaving for the weekend tomorrow morning and won&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; e-mails until Monday morning.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have a question for any one here. I believe in aliens, spirit and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ghost\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; communications via evp but tonight I had an experience I never had\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I woke up at exactly 2:22 by my stove&#39;s clock and went and cleaned my\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sink\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of dishes while I heated up some cream chipped beef (albiet not too\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exciting)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but while I sat there after in the dark with my family sleeping my\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hallway\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ilummating a light clored blue several times. Anyone else ever seen\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I look forward to any responses.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Andrea\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ************ **Get fantasy football with free live scoring.
