I played the "from our system" one first. That one I hear quite different on first impression tho I did hear some of what you did.
   
  "From a distant (three point eleven) star, tell a story today. "
  Under that I hear "(theyre bombing in north kira)" but I also hear the end the way you did if I stop/start it at the right point

Usually some can't hear foreign language method voices, especially those 
that speak the language. "Norma" is my wife, and "Max" is the kid from next 
door that used to be over almost everyday to work with the voices, but he's 
lost interest of the past year.

The foreign language method is just using a shortwave receiver to pick up a 
foreign language broadcast, and recording it open air style, placing the 
tape deck, or recorder a short distance from the radio, and announcing you 
are doing an EVP recording. Almost any language will work, I like the voice 
that come through using Japanese, or Chinese. I use my ham rig as a 
receiver, but also have a compact Sony AM/FM/SW. Charli Claypool told me 
about this method, and she uses languages from the internet. I used this 
method to demonstrate EVP to the guys on last fall's hunting trip, they we 
able to hear the voices straight from the little tape deck I used.
