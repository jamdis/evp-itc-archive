Looking at the site, it looks  \ncommercial.  How does it work for EVP? I&#39;m very interested, but I  \nknow nothing about this type of program at all.

Glad that y&#39;all are here!\n&gt;\n&gt; I saw some information in another ITC forum about DC Six, an audio\n&gt; editor that allows one to record EVP in Real Time... and it&#39;s\n&gt; awesome! Has anyone here tried out the demo version of this program\n&gt; that&#39;s now been updated to DC Seven?\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;ve been experimenting with it and it&#39;s really amazing. I\n&gt; can talk into it and some of my EVP contacts answer back right away.\n&gt; But because I am not knowledgeable about sound recorders except for\n&gt; the basics when it comes to editing my EVP, I would like to know if\n&gt; someone here could download the 10 day trial version of DC Seven and\n&gt; let me know what you think about it. I&#39;m having a few problems with\n&gt; getting it to work as it&#39;s probably supposed to work... mainly having\n&gt; a problem with feedback and so on..\n&gt; Here&#39;s the link to DC Seven&#39;s 10 trial demo:\n&gt; http://www.enhancedaudio.com/dc_seven.htm\n&gt; Hope someone here will try it out because I would love to know if it\n&gt; works for you!\n&gt;\n&gt; wingd\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\nWas his made speci ically o EVP?
