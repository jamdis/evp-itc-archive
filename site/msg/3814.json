On \none occasion one of the boards that had a Bio on it of the history \nof that cell block actually jumped out and Chris and I and that&#39;s \nwhere the shadow went up the wall.  I didn&#39;t see it, but i was \nworking a lot of equipment that night.  They were pissed at that \ntime and we heard them talking at the end of the hall and not from \nthe box, so they were really there.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is the link to it, Frank. Give a listen when you have a \ncouple  \n&gt; hours.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also listened to Steve H.&#39;s 2 hour recording from Eastern State  \n&gt; Penn last night. I found some of it amazing and some of it wildly  \n&gt; annoying, especially the researcher close by the microphone who \nwas  \n&gt; chewing gum. That aside, there was more very odd and wonderful  \n&gt; communication, and also a lot of Chris seeing shadows, \napparitions,  \n&gt; black masses crawling down hallways, and other things that no one  \n&gt; else seemed to see. I wanted to ask Steve H. if he had witnessed \nany  \n&gt; of this, since he was with Chris the whole time. For the \nlistener,  \n&gt; the effect was that of a veritable mob of live humans who (the \nposse  \n&gt; that night) who were kept in a constant state of anxiety. They \ndidn&#39;t  \n&gt; need the extra hype, HMO, &#39;cause the pissed off dead inmates were  \n&gt; being surly enough on their own.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d say I agreed with Chris&#39;s interpretations--and granted, I was \nnot  \n&gt; there and did have problems hearing because of gum smacking and \nother  \n&gt; people rustling and talking--about 30 percent of the time. That \nsaid,  \n&gt; I heard a lot of things loud and clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Dec 3, 2007, at 2:38 PM, Frank Sumption wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Interesting. This is the &quot;eveidence&quot; I usaully don&#39;t get to \nsee  \n&gt; &gt; and hear. All I usually hear is someone saying how every other  \n&gt; &gt; researcher in the world gets nothing, he is the only one that \ngets  \n&gt; &gt; the valid communucation, which personally I find highly \ninsulting.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  One fact is, I did not make a &quot;telephone to dead&quot;, I don&#39;t \nknow  \n&gt; &gt; what the f--- that is, and I don&#39;t endorse it!

Chris&#39;s box is quite\n&gt; &gt; capable of behaving like John Edward--directly bringing relations\n&gt; &gt; through to talk to those who need to hear them. Some of the \nresponses\n&gt; &gt; were astoundingly clear and loud. It certainly sounded similar \nto what\n&gt; &gt; I have heard of what Bruce is getting, and honestly, it is \nexactly\n&gt; &gt; what I hope to get with my box when I receive it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you haven&#39;t listened to this, you really should. I think \nChris\n&gt; &gt; made his usual statements about Edison and the 30, but aside from\n&gt; &gt; that, this was a wonderful session and people were extremely \nmoved.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you want, I&#39;ll find the URL.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From: Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Sent: Dec 3, 2007 12:40 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;To: Group &lt;evp-itc@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Maybe there is only one box user allowed!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Christopher was immediately taken by what he had seen and \nheard.\n&gt; &gt; He was able to &gt; make a direct connection with spirits. \ninhabitants,\n&gt; &gt; victims, participants, and &gt; witnesses...describing amazing \nevents and\n&gt; &gt; even some unspeakable acts that had &gt; happened within the walls \nof\n&gt; &gt; these notoriously haunted places. The details &gt; afforded by these\n&gt; &gt; spirits gave answers to lingering questions that could not &gt; \nhave come\n&gt; &gt; from anyone but the parties involved. Already amazed by the &gt;\n&gt; &gt; instrument&#39;s ability to connect with these historical figures,\n&gt; &gt; Christopher soon &gt; realized that other entities were trying to \nreach\n&gt; &gt; out as well. Deceased fathers, &gt; sons, mothers, daughters, and \nfriends\n&gt; &gt; of session participants were sending &gt; messages through the \ndevice.\n&gt; &gt; Talk of this spread, and last year, at the Ghost &gt; Chaser&#39;s \nWeekend\n&gt; &gt; Conference in Savannah, Georgia, Christopher was asked to do a &gt;\n&gt; &gt; presentation about his research with the Telephone to the Dead. \nThis\n&gt; &gt; quickly &gt; turned into an impromtu public demonstration, with\n&gt; &gt; participants, one by one, &gt; coming forward requesting to speak \nwith\n&gt; &gt; loved ones who had died. Surprisingly, &gt; even to Christopher, \nthese\n&gt; &gt; requests were met with comforting and sometimes vital &gt; \nmessages. The\n&gt; &gt; presentation was recorded and broadcasted by A.P.S.R. Radio.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From a recent add for another presentation, but apparently \nthe\n&gt; &gt; rest of us get nothing like this, so it doesn&#39;t even work for us.\n&gt; &gt; Guess I&#39;ll just go back to killing time wth Ham radio, and quit\n&gt; &gt; wasting all my time and money on useless boxes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Curious that no one else gets any &quot;real&quot; contacts--event the \nso\n&gt; &gt; called box inventor gets nothing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;__________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;You keep typing, we keep giving.
