The predictions you were touting were for August 15,\n&gt; and included end-of-the-world warning..  Trying to say these were correct,\n&gt; but not REALLY for August 15, and not REALLY end-of-the-world stuff, seems\n&gt; like a way to save face, or keep hoping the messages are real, when in fact,\n&gt; this is another example that they are not.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So from now on, you will no longer hear clear dates and predictions.  You\n&gt; may hear vague dates and vague predictions if you like, but you will not\n&gt; hear anything that can be confirmed.  Doing so would put you in a position\n&gt; of having to question the verity of the EVP data you collect.  And that\n&gt; might lead to abandoning this while area of study.  And we\n&gt; &gt; know you cannot do that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On Sun, 8/16/09, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@ gmail.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@ gmail.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Calm thyself-again and again and again.....\n&gt; &gt; To: evp-itc@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Sunday, August 16, 2009, 3:08 PM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Well, it seems the original prediction of the east coast getting\n&gt; clobbered is probably correct.
