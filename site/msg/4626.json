I, too, was at \nThe Stanley when Mark Macy spoke there; afterwards he took polaroid \nphotos of us with the luminator.  The photos were interesting; some \nof them looked like mere double exposures, others did show what could \nbe the superimposition of another face from another dimension. I&#39;m \nnew to visual ITC, so the jury&#39;s out on this one for now!\n\nSharon\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Debbie Tejada &lt;debbie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Wow, I&#39;m loving all this information, it&#39;s giving me a lot of \nideas.  \n&gt; Very exciting for me!\n&gt; \n&gt; Does Mark Macy belong to this forum too? I met him about 3 years \nago.  \n&gt; My husband is a commercial photographer and Mark asked him to do \nhis  \n&gt; portrait for a book he was coming out with. He came to our home \nstudio  \n&gt; for the portrait, and I got to talk with him a little about what \nhe  \n&gt; does. At that time all I knew of EVP was from the White Noise \nmovie,  \n&gt; wasn&#39;t sure it was real. But Mark was very nice, passionate about \nITC/ \n&gt; EVP and very convincing. I wasn&#39;t quite sure what to expect when I  \n&gt; originally heard what he did, with all the loonies out there \nclaiming  \n&gt; all kinds of stuff, but I got a really good feeling from him and \nhe&#39;s  \n&gt; very, well, like I said, convincing. After that I went to his web \nsite  \n&gt; and also bought one of his books, which was a nice read.\n&gt; \n&gt; I went to the Stanley Hotel in November with a ghost hunting group \nand\n&gt; Mark was a speaker there. I was really looking forward to his \nlecture,  \n&gt; but ended up with a wicked stomach virus and had to come home \nearly. I  \n&gt; missed just about everything that weekend!\n&gt; \n&gt; Deb T\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Dec 29, 2007, at 9:51 AM, Ursula Bielski wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Oops.  I forgot to answer: No, I have not given up ghost hunting \nat  \n&gt; &gt; all, but over the years I have come to focus more on the \ncollection  \n&gt; &gt; and distribution of experiences than on encountering phenomena  \n&gt; &gt; myself.  ITC has really affirmed this for me.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve felt all along that my job is to make people aware that  \n&gt; &gt; spiritual phenomena go on all the time in millions of lives; I&#39;m \nnot  \n&gt; &gt; a scientist and I know nothing I do will change the way science  \n&gt; &gt; thinks.  BUT if I can open the minds of young people today, \nperhaps  \n&gt; &gt; our future scientists will make it their business to figure all \nthis  \n&gt; &gt; out.\n&gt; &gt; I know this is a lot of what ITC experimenters are doing: \nconvincing  \n&gt; &gt; others of the afterlife by their recorded evidence.  Amazing \nthings  \n&gt; &gt; can happen when THAT happens.\n&gt; &gt; Again, Mark Macy is so wonderful because he has dedicated his \nlife  \n&gt; &gt; to this.  He and his colleagues have received such detailed  \n&gt; &gt; descriptions of how the afterlife works, that they have helped \nthe  \n&gt; &gt; living change their lives to erase the fear of death--and to live \nin  \n&gt; &gt; a way that brings us to as high a spiritual level as possible \nright  \n&gt; &gt; away when our bodies die.  This means, for example, dealing with  \n&gt; &gt; issues and addictions, that plague us in life, since the spirits  \n&gt; &gt; tell us we take it all with us!  That is, death isn&#39;t a cure-all.\n&gt; &gt; Any glimpse at the history of ITC shows us that all of this has \nbeen  \n&gt; &gt; gradually growing since the 19th century, when state-of-the-art  \n&gt; &gt; graphite pencils and telegraphs were used to contact the dead.   \n&gt; &gt; Since then, there have been &quot;breakthroughs&quot; a number of times \nwhen  \n&gt; &gt; astounding floods of messages have come through.\n&gt; &gt; You experimenters are all so incredible--I&#39;m amazed every day at  \n&gt; &gt; your love, dedication and faith.  Surely something wonderful is  \n&gt; &gt; going to come from all this, and I think it&#39;s going to come \nduring  \n&gt; &gt; our lifetimes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ursula\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Robin Searcy Henson &lt;MudPuddleFarm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hello Bill,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, I did steal that phrase from Ursula because I thought it  \n&gt; &gt; described what I was doing as compared to what I would like to \nbe  \n&gt; &gt; doing!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I like what you said about focus on the equipment helping to  \n&gt; &gt; establish the psychic connection.

There \nare  \n&gt; &gt; many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who believe that communication is between the conscious of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; researcher and the entity and the equipment is secondary. It&#39;s  \n&gt; &gt; easy to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get swept up in the technology and forget there is possibly a  \n&gt; &gt; psychic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; connection going on. With that said, focusing on equipment \nactually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can help the researcher become receptive to establishing a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; communication link. While paying attention to the equipment, \nwe  \n&gt; &gt; forget\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about the daily distractions and minor irritations that may  \n&gt; &gt; prevent us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from establishing contact.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The setting up the gear we use could be considered the first \npart of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;ritual&quot;. I like to clear my mind, set up equipment, mess \nwith  \n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some more, then I am mentally prepare to begin what I hope will \nbe a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; successful session.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess &quot;random&quot; recording to me would be what happens in the \nfield\n&gt; &gt; &gt; during a paranormal investigation. I don&#39;t bring Box \ntechnology  \n&gt; &gt; into a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; location with the intention of possibly contacting lingering \nspirits\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at that location but I do bring audio recorders in hopes of  \n&gt; &gt; recording\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evp&#39;s.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I find the Box works perhaps even better when I&#39;m in a \nfamiliar  \n&gt; &gt; place\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like the room in my home that is designated for that purpose. I \ndo\n&gt; &gt; &gt; desire to have the finest Box technology that is possible but \nmore\n&gt; &gt; &gt; important is the association that seems to occur between the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; researcher and the Box that is favored. Despite some of the \nbenefits\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the new gear, the one that I seem to have a connection with \nis  \n&gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that requires a little more finesse to operate. -Bill\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robin Henson&quot; \n&lt;MudPuddleFarm@&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wow, thanks for your help guys!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ursula, your post was lovely.

I haven&#39;t been too active in the realm of EVP \nrecording\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recently, but have had what I consider excellent results \nin  \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; past\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using my little refurbished Ebay-bargain Olympus VN-120 \nPC.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m anxious to start recording again and am feeling pretty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overwhelmed by the technology you all seem to be using. \nI  \n&gt; &gt; know a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little about using good headphones and denoiser programs, \nbut\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beyond\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I&#39;m electronically challenged. Still, I wonder if \nthere  \n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simple techniques I can experiment with to increase my  \n&gt; &gt; success.

My most impressive EVPs \nhave  \n&gt; &gt; always\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; captured around my own home, particularly outside on the  \n&gt; &gt; hill and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near the barn. I&#39;ve gotten two inside my house (after \ninviting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been negative\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messages.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;m thinking about getting another DVR and would  \n&gt; &gt; love to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your thoughts and recommendations about which ones are \nbest.
