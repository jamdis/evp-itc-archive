I can't vouch for your computer or servers, but I just did some tests, and =
sent a 2.1MB wav file from MSN to Yahoo and back, once allowing compression=
, and once turning it off.=A0=A0 I was able to verify that one was compress=
ed and one was not, by checking the sizes when they arrived at Yahoo. Once =
they came back to MSN, I then did a bit-level comparison of the original, a=
nd the ones sent around email.=A0 They were all identical, which indicates =
lossless compression.

If you have a file you'd like me to test for you, le=

, without testing them yourself.

For executables, you may =
be right. However, 
for wav files, the compression during email is not loss=
 less. 
=A0
I used to think as you do, in that the 
emailed attachment=A0of=
 a wav file would not loose anything. After a lengthy 
discourse with anoth=
er member here, I learned that I was wrong. The reason 
why=A0I did not rea=
lize it in the first place is that when I would email a 
wav file, I would =
intentionally keep it in very small segments, to keep file 
size down. This=
 was just for ease of transfer. But because of this, I had not 
experienced=
 any noticeable loss.
=A0
Now it may be in some cases, depending on 
the se=
rvers or what have you that the file goes through, that the loss may be 
le=
ss or more. But once the attachment is 
downloaded,=A0the=A0quality=A0has b=
een found to be less then the 
original wav.
=A0
Again though you can only =
really tell when 
the=A0wav file is large.

      The kind of compression that occurs during an email 
       =
 attachment is "lossless": it compress the file cleverly without losing 
  =
      information.=A0 For example, if I had a program in some .exe files, 
=
        and I sent it over email, it could compress it.=A0 But if it lost 
=
        even one bit, the resulting exe file would not execute again after =
it 
        was uncompressed on the other side.

This kind of compression d=
oes 
        things like looking for common patterns in the file, and repla=
cing them 
        with a token.=A0 A rough example would be if it found "H=
owdy 
        Neighbor" in a file 20 times, it could replace all the occura=
nces with 
        say $HN1.=A0 And also write a little dictionary in there=
 someplace 
        that says "$HN1=3DHowdy Neighbor".

When the file gets =
to its 
        destination it can be uncompressed, and all occurences of $=
HN1 are 
        replaced with "Howdy Neighbor".=A0 So it was compressed (i=
nstead of 
        14 characters each, it only needed 4, plus the dictionar=
y), but lost no 
        data.

Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not lo=
ssless.=A0 
        Depending on the level of compression, some level of da=
ta is lost, and 
        so cannot be recovered or reconstructed

          Another thing:
          =A0
          I=
 recently found this out. When 
          you email a file, if it is not sa=
ved as a compressed format, the email 
          filtering process will act=
ually compress the file 
          automatically.
          =A0
          S=
o even if you have attached a 
          wav. file, it will loose resolutio=
n over the email process. It will 
          not sound exactly the same as =
the original wav. file. How much it 
          differs depends on the size =
of the file you are attaching. If it is a 
          very=A0large file, it =
will sound much different.
          =A0
          The only exception to th=
is is if 
          the wav. file is small enough that the filtering proces=
s will ignore 
          it. It has to be pretty small though, like under 1=
=A0MB (I am not 
          exactly sure of the threshold).
          =A0
  =
        The best way to share files over 
          the internet=A0if you w=
ant them as close to the original as 
          possible is to upload them =
directly to a website.
