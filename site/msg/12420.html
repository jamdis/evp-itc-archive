<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Maybe we can set up specific locations and dates across the US (and in
other countries for people here from outside the US) for general
meet-ups.  Call it &quot;boxapalooza on tour&quot;, or whatever you want.  Have
a meet-up on the west coast, the Midwest, the east coast, etc.  Ego&#x27;s
and &quot;names&quot; checked at the door, etc.

There&#x27;s also the option of regular city specific monthly meetings as
well.  Similar to how the hacker/tech magazine 2600 has user
groups/meetups -

&gt; This distance issue has been a bummer for all long time researchers.  
&gt; The only answer I can see is to simply meet up. I&#x27;d suggest doing so  
&gt; minus those known to proclaim themselves &quot;experts&quot; or &quot;certified&quot; as  
&gt; such claims are ridiculous.</pre>
