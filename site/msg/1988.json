As expected, there&#39;s a few things I needed \nto change \n&gt; on the layout, that&#39;s what the proto type boards are for. The blue \njumper \n&gt; wires are #30 wire-wrap wire. I could get rid of the jumpers by \ngoing to 4 \n&gt; layer boards, but that more than doubles the cost. This is both the \nlinear \n&gt; and random sweep sections shown here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; See what you&#39;re getting intobefore you go there \n&gt; http://newlivehotmail.com/?\nocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_viral_preview_0507\n&gt;\nfrank,\n\nthe new board looks great, lets hope it works as good as the old ones.\n\nbruce"}
