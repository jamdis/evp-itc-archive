 attempt to make his first box.





Hello all,

Thanks for having me apart=
 of your yahoo group. Ive been researching this a lot and was overly excite=
d to find a group that actually has frank posting in it.

I'm about to atte=
mpt to make my first box ( well i have made the ufogeek radio shack hack, b=
ut that was too easy). I plan to try and make the one with a random voltage=
 generator that's plugged into the Radio Shack 499, and if I can do that su=
ccessfully, out to an echo-box before heading out.

My question to you all =
is if you could point me in the right direction to get up to speed enough o=
n circuits and electronics via a website or book. I have no experience doin=
g this kind of stuff. But im a quick learner and really want to make this h=
appen.

Thanks for the help everyone,

God Bless and Good Results to you al=
l.

David
