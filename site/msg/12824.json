I have been experimenting with\n&gt; ITC for about 6 months now, with fairly good results from a\n&gt; basic radio shack hack. I am hoping to learn more about the\n&gt; set up of other devices and maybe gain some more technical\n&gt; knowledge from this group. \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: &quot;Misty Dawn&quot; &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 17, 2008 3:32pm\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Hello there everyone\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Marie. Welcome to the group. I enjoy manual sweep tuning\n&gt; and have had some great results including direct responses\n&gt; using that method. I think when they use my name (first\n&gt; middle and last) constantly that kind of throws out the\n&gt; randomness idea most skeptics have. But usually it takes\n&gt; people hearing thier own names and info to wonder if there\n&gt; is more to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Mon, 11/17/08, marie32711 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: marie32711 \n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Hello there everyone\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Monday, November 17, 2008, 12:56 PM\n&gt; &gt; Hi i am really interested in evp/itc and have been\n&gt; recording\n&gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; aproximately 5/6 months i currently do both normal evp\n&gt; work\n&gt; &gt; and also \n&gt; &gt; radio scanning(not franks box or radio shack hacks)\n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; manually \n&gt; &gt; scanning through the channels..i have been quite\n&gt; surprised\n&gt; &gt; by the \n&gt; &gt; results that i have got.\n&gt; &gt; I have video posted on youtube(screen name mazblondie)\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; it would be \n&gt; &gt; excellent if anyone could give there opinions.\n&gt; &gt; I have had many different theory presented to me, from\n&gt; &gt; imaginationto \n&gt; &gt; plain faking it, but i can believe that it is all down\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; chance!!\n&gt; &gt; Hope to hear from you soon.\n&gt; &gt; Marie\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
