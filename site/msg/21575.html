<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t know how one would put somehthing like together. I&#x27;m just a techno droid. I&#x27;m not a spiritual master, or understand the communcations that much, I&#x27;m just intrigued and hooked on this stuff cuz something talks, it seems to know me, and it&#x27;s ever present. I only know if you provide a way that &quot;they&quot; can make voices, they will talk, any method of supplying the raw audio seems to work, and some things work better than the boxes.

&gt; :( You mean, I&#x27;m not an expert after only a few months of following your
&gt; work? Dammit! (LOL, just kiddin&#x27; around.)
&gt; 
&gt; I think it would really be great and helpful, at least to me, if someone
&gt; held an ITC/EVP summit where ONLY people who are interested in this
&gt; technology could get together and participate in round-table discussions
&gt; to share ideas, listen to each other&#x27;s work (recordings, live
&gt; demonstrations), learn from The Masters in the field (like yourself!),
&gt; and come to some serious understandings. NO celebrity promotions, no
&gt; ghost investigations or ghost celebrities (no offense, anyone, but it&#x27;s
&gt; not the place for it), no fund raising, no vendors, no competition for
&gt; the spotlight, just talking and learning from each other and developing
&gt; relationships. There&#x27;s so much to learn and no one person knows it all
&gt; or can share everything they know in a handful of postings on a Web
&gt; site. I think  real human interaction is what helps progress
&gt; understanding. People who are serious about learning this stuff would
&gt; come to something like that, and they would appreciate it for what it
&gt; is. I think you guys who create and understand this technology have a
&gt; real responsibility to help others understand it. It&#x27;s the Spiderman
&gt; principle! &quot;With great power comes great responsibility.&quot; (Thanks, Uncle
&gt; Ben!)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I just feel like sometimes people in this field are too afraid to share
&gt; information because people will debunk them or try to discredit them or
&gt; someone will &quot;steal&quot; their ideas (believe me, I&#x27;m no friggin&#x27; stranger
&gt; to having my ideas stolen! They don&#x27;t want ME around, but the a**wipes
&gt; sure as hell LOVE my ideas!!). I really think that most people are more
&gt; accepting than that, though, and that it&#x27;s time that serious researchers
&gt; who aren&#x27;t in it for the fame come together and make some progress. I&#x27;d
&gt; be happy to volunteer to help organize such a thing.

&gt; &gt;  Propagation even from the other side seems to be a function of solar
&gt; &gt; activity, years ago as the sunspots went away, so did the clarity of
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; voices. Compressed=mp3 file. Here is one area of real research, people
&gt; could
&gt; &gt; be comparing contact strength, instead of just declaring themselves
&gt; top box
&gt; &gt; experts.
