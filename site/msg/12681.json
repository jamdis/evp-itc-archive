He is coming at it from a scientific\nPOV. His stance is based on the lack of scientific evidence, controlled\nexperiments and claims that can easily be duplicated. This is why ITC is\nscoffed by the scientific community. Making extraordinary claims without\nscientific evidence to back it up makes every EVP researcher look like a\ncool aid drinker. Mr. Moon originally indicated that only a magic thirty\npeople could make the device work, which would suggest selective physics.\nPhysics works the same for everyone, and any real proof must have scientific\nprinciples backing it up.\n \nHe is open to there being something to it. It just hasn&#39;t stood up yet to\nserious scientific scrutiny. So far it has failed at every turn. Spiricom\nwas a fraud. The interesting part of the story is why it was a fraud. It\nreveals things about the individuals psychology that gives a great deal of\ninsight about perceptions and ego. We want to believe it works, and often\ntimes it makes us fall victim to pareidolia. Case in point. Take a recording\nof a voice produced by any one of these devices. Play it in isolation to\nfive people. Have them write down what they hear. If they all hear the same\nthing alone, then there is something to it. If they all hear something\ndifferent, it is Gaussian noise and pareidolia, a well documented effect.\n \nThis is why serious, disciplined research is tantamount to this part of the\nfield ever being taken seriously.\n \nDavid M.
