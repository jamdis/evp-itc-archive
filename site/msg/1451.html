Steve,

Here are some more questions that I have received EVP&#x27;s on.

&quot;Is there a reason why you stay in this room more than other rooms?&quot;

&quot;How old are you?&quot;

&quot;What city were you born in?&quot;

&quot;Were you ever married?&quot;

&quot;Would you like me to stay, or would you like me to go?&quot;

&quot;Please speak as loud as you can.&quot;

&quot;How many children did you have?&quot;

&quot;How many of you are there?&quot;

James

&gt; &gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What questions do you ask now?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here are some I like to ask:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is it OK if I record your voice?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is it OK if I take your picture?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What is your name?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Do you know where you are?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Do you know what year it is?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; When were you born?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Where were you born?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; When did you die?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What was your cause of death?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Do you enjoy being here?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Are there others here with you?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Do you want (me) (us) to leave?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is it OK if we stay?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Do you enjoy having visitors?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does any of your family ever visit you?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is it OK if we come back again?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Do you like sports? (Baseball?) (Football?) etc.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Did you have any hobbies?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What do you miss the most?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; -------------------------------
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve gotten some interesting responses.  Last year I asked &quot;Do 
you 
&gt; know 
&gt; &gt; what year it is?&quot; and a woman&#x27;s voice plainly said &quot;1996&quot;. On 
one 
&gt; &gt; investigation I asked &quot;Do you want us to leave?&quot; and a male 
voice 
&gt; said 
&gt; &gt; &quot;You just got here.&quot; At another site someone asked &quot;What was 
your 
&gt; cause 
&gt; &gt; of death?&quot; and I heard &quot;poisoning&quot;.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s funny when the ghosts join in on your conversations even 
&gt; though 
&gt; &gt; you&#x27;re not asking questions.  Some of them are very playful.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was on one investigation a couple years ago when someone 
&gt; asked &quot;Do you 
&gt; &gt; know the Cubs are in the World Series this year?&quot;  :-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you are at the location of a tombstone you can ask if the 
&gt; person is 
&gt; &gt; (name on tombstone) or knows (name on tombstone).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I hope those help a little bit.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to do another EVP session with the box, but am tired of 
&gt; asking
&gt; &gt; &gt; the same questions.  Does anybody have any good relevant 
&gt; questions i
&gt; &gt; &gt; could ask?
