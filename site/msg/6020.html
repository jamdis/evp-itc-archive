Anne,
             I know just where Bruce is coming from here, cause I have to be honest,  I feel the same way.  If you taking a look at the posts from the weekend, there is nothing but mud slinging and disrespect directed towards our research.  The conversations were in no way even a heathly debate.  It's ok to disagree and be opened minded, but sometimes some people you just have to shake you head and walk away.  No matter what you say your response will never be right in their eyes.  
   
  I joinned this group over almost 2 years ago.  I have watched, listened and learned from many.  I have observed those who in my opinion have taked advantage of Frank as well as the others and had nothing but selfish movities on their agenda.  I have seen people BEG for boxes, have threated people via email and telephone, to the point where it has been come hate towards what we are doing.  
   
  I have stayed slient regarding this for a long while, and its about time that if you can not be professional, curtious, and serious about what we are all doing here as a whole, THEN DON'T LET THE DOOR HIT YOU IN THE ASS!
   
  See regardless whether we post to this board or not, those who will continue the work will always be in contact and be dedicated to this work no matter what!
   
  Juli

  Please breathe and relax. You're very stressed today, obviously. How can so few and little flames mean anything to someone who has been through the terrible fires that you have? You matter here and your help is invaluable. You are also our friend and would be terribly missed here.
  

  Peace and affection,
  

  Ann

          Fellow researchers,

I have decided to back away from participating in this group for a 
while. The constant clash of ego's and childish bickering of which I 
have become a big part has begun to affect my research in a negative 
way.
I have been advised to retreat from being an active part of this 
group for an undetermined amount of time. I would like to stay on the 
rolls as a member but will not actively participate as far as posting 
results, files or opinions and advice.

I will however be posting the results of my research on my box website
if there are any of you who would like to hear them.

For the new members, please do not let my comments on this matter 
affect your opinion of this research. I have chosen not to 
participate here for personal reasons. I will be devoting all my 
energy to advancing the communication and technology.

If any new members feel they value my advice please feel free to 
privately e-mail me paranormalinvestigating@...

I will be glad to help anyone but will not offer advice on any 
subjects posted here.

Thank you to all the friends that I have managed to make here you 
have been an immeasurable help.

Thank you
Bruce Halliday
