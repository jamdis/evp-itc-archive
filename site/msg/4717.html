<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s farily straight forward to repair, you can tell what conductor 
goes to what conductor on the board. It&#x27;s just a matter of making 
little jumpers with small wire to bridge the breaks. Radio shack has 
#30 wire wrap wire that works well for that kind of stuff. Maybe 
there&#x27;s enough of the original pad left on the connectors that you 
could glue them back in place, then jumper the breaks. I could look 
at it tomorrow, as well.

&gt; Hi Frank,
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;d heard you were in Littleton -- is there any chance you could 
take  
&gt; a look at this in person and tell me how to fix it? I had a feeling 
it  
&gt; was going to be a serious problem, but since its messed up already 
I  
&gt; guess I have nothing to lose. I could bring it by your place or we  
&gt; could meet some where convenient to you if you have a few minutes. 
I  
&gt; have a pointy tipped soldering iron that&#x27;s made for smaller 
electronic  
&gt; stuff and have a background in botanic illustration so I&#x27;m used to  
&gt; working on details. If I could get some guidance from you I&#x27;m 
willing  
&gt; to try myself.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you think?

&gt; &gt; Ouch! That redish colored torn stuff is a circuit trace torn off 
the
&gt; &gt; board, it&#x27;s green colored on top, and copper colored on the
&gt; &gt; underside.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Those are surface mount connectors, and wires would have to be
&gt; &gt; soldered on the connector tabs, then spliced onto the board. I 
don&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; know if I can solder anything that small with the iron I have.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I hate advertise it, but I&#x27;m in Littleton.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, one of my DIY projects this weekend has been to convert my
&gt; &gt; &gt; husband&#x27;s old Olympus to infrared. We&#x27;re not extremely talented 
in
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; electronics area, but we have fun and seem to muddle by. No 
guts no
&gt; &gt; &gt; glory, huh?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, for the most part the operation has been a success. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; photographed every step of the way and taped screws and parts 
to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; photos so we&#x27;d know how to rebuild everything we took apart, and
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; has worked just fine. I located the IR filter, removed it and 
cut
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; replaced it with a piece of glass slide.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The one problem we ran into is that there were two wires that
&gt; &gt; appeared
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be clipped in place as opposed to being soldered or screwed 
in
&gt; &gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt; everything else. When we tried to pry the clips open, instead 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; whole thing came off the circuit board. WE HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO
&gt; &gt; PROCEED
&gt; &gt; &gt; FROM HERE. I don&#x27;t know if we can just glue the darn things 
down and
&gt; &gt; &gt; if so, what type of glue to use, or if we&#x27;re just plain up the
&gt; &gt; creek.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I immediately thought of this group of brainy electronics 
buffs. I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; &gt; hoping someone out there can give us some advice, or if you live
&gt; &gt; near
&gt; &gt; &gt; Highlands Ranch, CO, you could help in person &amp; bail us out of
&gt; &gt; this. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; was hoping to take this camera to the St. Augustine Lighthouse 
at
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; end of this coming week.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any hope? I&#x27;ve posted a photo of an extreme closeup of 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; clips (one is pink, the other is ivory) and the damaged board --
 I
&gt; &gt; had
&gt; &gt; &gt; to sandwich two photos together to get both in focus at the same
&gt; &gt; time
&gt; &gt; &gt; (that&#x27;s why it looks that way). For an idea of scale, the clips 
are
&gt; &gt; &gt; both the same size, about 4 mm in width, 4 mm tall, 3 mm deep. 
Not
&gt; &gt; &gt; easy to handle and even harder to see with these middle age 
eyes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Any advice would be GREATLY APPRECIATED!! Deb T.
