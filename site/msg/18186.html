If I=C2=A0 share the image with=
 someone before the experiment, it requires everyone trust that person not =
to reveal the image to someone else.=C2=A0 But there is no reason to requir=

By posting the passworded image before the test, eve=

Do the experiment.
Send out the password. People unlock their private imag=

Simple.=C2=A0

 I see a point that frank makes.  For e=
xample, my file was very clear that said "marker".  It doesn't mean that we=
 are all nuts, that's the information that was given to us.  It was a direc=
t response to a question that i asked.  It's not our fault that they gave m=
e bad info, they probably didn't know the answer. 


 

 I don't want to tr=
eat them like some retarded idiots over there, i wish to give them respect.=
  The fact in my mind is that they are saying something and just because th=
ey didn't get your test right doesn't mean that it's any less fascinating t=
o me that something talks that shouldn't.  They probably could care less wh=
at's on your monitor.  


 

 They are probably sitting there trying to fig=
ure out why you aren't doing anything yourself.
