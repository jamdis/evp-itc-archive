<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ann!
Check out this link for information about this software being 
discussed on Keith&#x27;s forum:
http://www.itcbridge.com/forum/view_topic.php?id=192&amp;forum_id=5
I also just posted a reply to Misty&#x27;s comments with information you 
might find useful. 

But because a couple of people were able to get some incredible real 
time evp results with this software is promising! Yet, because of ths 
feedback problem I&#x27;m having, regardless that I&#x27;m getting EVP coming 
in, it&#x27;s frustrating having to iron out these tech. issues to get it 
working right. Hope you can try it out to see if you have any luck 
with it!

&gt; Was this made specifically for EVP? Looking at the site, it looks  
&gt; commercial.  How does it work for EVP? I&#x27;m very interested, but I  
&gt; know nothing about this type of program at all. How do you make it  
&gt; work for you to record EVP?

&gt; &gt; Hi,it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve logged on here but just popping in 
to
&gt; &gt; say hi gang! Glad that y&#x27;all are here!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I saw some information in another ITC forum about DC Six, an audio
&gt; &gt; editor that allows one to record EVP in Real Time... and it&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; awesome! Has anyone here tried out the demo version of this 
program
&gt; &gt; that&#x27;s now been updated to DC Seven?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with it and it&#x27;s really amazing. I
&gt; &gt; can talk into it and some of my EVP contacts answer back right 
away.
&gt; &gt; But because I am not knowledgeable about sound recorders except 
for
&gt; &gt; the basics when it comes to editing my EVP, I would like to know 
if
&gt; &gt; someone here could download the 10 day trial version of DC Seven 
and
&gt; &gt; let me know what you think about it. I&#x27;m having a few problems 
with
&gt; &gt; getting it to work as it&#x27;s probably supposed to work... mainly 
having
&gt; &gt; a problem with feedback and so on..
&gt; &gt; Here&#x27;s the link to DC Seven&#x27;s 10 trial demo:
&gt; &gt; http://www.enhancedaudio.com/dc_seven.htm
&gt; &gt; Hope someone here will try it out because I would love to know if 
it
&gt; &gt; works for you!
