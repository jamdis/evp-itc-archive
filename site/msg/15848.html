If you ever get back over there Zack, encourage him to cross over into the  
light, and/or send him a prayer if not though to get him to cross over into 
the  light, let him know he has loved ones there waiting for him.   By 
giving us all this wonderful gift is probably, God' hoping we will all  be like 
an emissary to redirect these souls back to Him, sending  them all  back to 
the true spiritual home.

Hi,
 
I don't know how you would "test" the entities. One of the best I've ever  
goten though was at the former Manteno State Mental Hospital in  Illinois.
 
I was there with a group of about 8 people and the place was very active  
that night. The building we were in is shaped like an "H". We were in one arm 
 of the H looking across at the other and saw a shadow figure moving 
around. We  were just commenting on the figure when a voice came up in my 
recording saying  "It's Harold Wing."  It repeated this once and then said "It's  
Harold."
 
Now, none of us heard any of this while we were standing there and none  of 
us knew or ever heard of Harold Wing. One of the people there later managed 
 to get into the old records for the hospital and found Harold Wing was a  
patient there who died of typhoid fever there in 1938.

I am new to the group, I am a practicing Spiritualist but have never done  
any EVP work. How reliable is the info you are getting, have any of you  
tested the entities/voices? What are some of the best messages  received?
