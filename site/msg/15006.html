It's funny. Whenever I drive past a cemetery with a car load of kids I tell=
 them to look out in the cemetery and see if they see people. A few will sa=
y yes! Then I ask them to tell me which ones are ghosts.

You mean me, April??

Yes and no. It was more of a shado=

d in front of my husband and I for a few seconds (we both saw it), then it =
turned and popped outside the apartment door. I say popped because it made =
an audible "pop" and the apartment shook as it went out.

I am of the op=
