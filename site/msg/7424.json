I suppose this is when I am left off guard.\nI have had all ages all eras and all walks of life approach me. Some of \nit has been very sad...some, well deserved. \nI NEVER feel alone...in fact, &quot;THEY&quot; see to it that I am not alone...if \nI close the bathroom door...they open it...when I go to bed...the hover \nover me...I ALWAYS hold the rail when I go down the stairs...It never \nends.\nMy cats cry when I leave and my dog growls at around 3 am every morning.\nIn fact, worse than this...A dog I know comes from a neighbor...but \nhave never seen...goes crazy at 3 am...every morning...barking at my \nyard.\nMatch this to the weird photos I have taken of my yard and it is kind \nof creepy.\nI have very weird photos...my yard seems to be the place of energy.\nMy house is over 106 years old...\nLots of stuff...but mostly since hubby dug the fire pit."}
