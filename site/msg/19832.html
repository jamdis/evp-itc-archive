&gt;   well i don&#x27;t know so much about faces but i do alittle about reverse
&gt; speech which sorta of happened by mistake...I know if i look hard i will be
&gt; able to find a file that I got my mistake its a regular digital recording
&gt; which i didn&#x27;t no that was being recorded (my 5 year use to do that alot)
&gt; anyway he and i was arguing about our 7 month old at the time not so much
&gt; arguing but you no what I mean...and i said to him &quot;hey she trying to get
&gt; your attention&quot; and he was like I see her and he started like sing to her a
&gt; silly little song that didn&#x27;t have alot of words in it...well when played
&gt; back words if was unreal  he says &quot;ignore her..I ignore her..do you her
&gt; Ursula&quot; he even says my name Now you have to understand what he says forward
&gt; is NOTHING like he says backward so i may very very much aware we have those
&gt; abilities weather we know it or not...I think on the other side the have
&gt; mastered it..I&#x27;ll have to go throw alot of file but everyone who hears it
&gt; can&#x27;t believe it!

&gt;   I&#x27;m thinking there is faces embedded in sound, it&#x27;s related to speech,
&gt; and not just EVP. It seems to be a normal function of our own minds(living
&gt; or dead), the same as reverse speech. I found some faces in old EVPs from
&gt; boxes and also in music files. The ones from Evanescence are pretty
&gt; impressive in person, and do not seem to be intentionaly embedded.
&gt;
&gt;  I know, it&#x27;s not ghost hunters, and most don&#x27;t want to have to think.
&gt; I think most want this stuff in a neat little box, all well defined, all
&gt; rules and protocols known, but it just won&#x27;t stay in one box, or universe
&gt; for that matter.
