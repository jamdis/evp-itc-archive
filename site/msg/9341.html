Mrs. Margaret
   
  I just playing with you, I didn't mean nothing bad.  I know you like all forms of real time spirit comminucation, and also your water videos (which I think are great, and i think the newbies should check out your site).  I just need to have some fun lately!

          Hi Rees. What is said, and still maintain this opinion, is: 

My best (clearest, longest, most meaningful) responses have come via the manual radio 
sweep technique. My next favorite is the MiniBox. Third on my list of preferences is the 
hacked Radio Shack models. This is not to say I do not like them, but I like them least. 

This also does not mean that I'm not open to experimenting with another model (I 
currently own both the old and new 469's and the old 470's, so I have based my opinion 
on experience and not just uninformed bias).

I would place EVP Maker with the allophones file ahead of the shack hacks as well, but I 
don't consider that method to be among the 'radio sweep' methods for comparison.
