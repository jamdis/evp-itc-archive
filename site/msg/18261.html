Snowfire,

Thanks for making it louder - I heard it this time and here are=
 my thoughts:  Sounds like a man's voice saying "we ain't dead", then a wom=
an's voice saying "that's a lie; yeah we're dead".  Strangely the woman's v=
oice kind of sounded like your voice; it could be that whoever's coming thr=
ough is mimicking your voice (I've heard a similar mimicking effect before =
in an EVP session conducted by someone I know and trust).  The other though=
t that crossed my mind is perhaps you knowingly or unknowingly spoke those =
words out loud and it was picked up by your recorder's microphone.  Please =
understand that I'm not trying to be contrary and that I'm just voicing my =
thoughts and could be totally wrong since I do not know you at all.

That b=
eing said, it's interesting to me that after the man said "we ain't dead," =
the woman replied "that's a lie" (so spirits, like humans, do lie); "yeah w=
e're dead" (or perhaps the two differ in their views on the state of being =
"dead").

Nonetheless this is all very interesting, Snowfire; thank you for=
 sharing.

Sharon from SF
