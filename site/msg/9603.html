No not at all. It does not bother me.
   
  I just thought it was wierd that since starting box research, I seem to be hearing them without the radio.
   
  i actually think it is cool!
   
  Since I started the box research, I have been doing some serious thinking about where they are and where we are. The only difference is I have a body and they dont.  On a day to day purpose, I have a wife and kids to take care of, and a job to pay the bills, and a lawn to mow, and I beg to wonder what responsibilities do they now have after they leave that physical life behind. Time does not exist, right? Is there a night and day there? So what do they do? Like the spirits we all talk to, what do they do when they are not talking to us, or when we are asleep?

Many involved in this research have experienced it at one time or 
another. For those who think they can turn on or turn off the spirit 
world or open/close some invisible doorway, it can be very unsettling 
to be communicated with when they arent expecting it and sometimes in 
ways they dont appreciate.
