<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks. Calling it an echo box has brought some negative comments, 
as skeptics think I&#x27;m adding sound effects to the signal. but using 
the box wiht channels seems to really enhance the voices, more than 
just using an empty box, or even no box. This latest sound box was 
made as I do everything else, just on a whim, the whole project being 
guided by intuition from day one. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t really feel like 
I actually know anything.

&gt; Well, if the waves have to bend around corners and work their way 
&gt; through chambers, that is an echo box in my opinion, as the sound 
waves 
&gt; are delayed and thus slowed down by doing so.  I think you are fine 
to 
&gt; call it an echo box, as slowing down the sound may be why it helps 
the 
&gt; sound of the voices become more discernable.  Bruce slows his 
&gt; recordings down a bit to make them easier to hear, as well.  One 
way is 
&gt; by a box of chambers, the other by way of a computer program.
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds good to me, Frank.

&gt; &gt;  This  is from #24 and the big echo box. I was going to stop 
&gt; callingit an echo box, but that despite the critisim, that still 
seem 
&gt; sotbe the best description.   First the voice says &quot;Bombs hit 
England&quot;, 
&gt; then &quot;length of channel doubles energy&quot;, so I&#x27;m not sure if they 
mean 
&gt; the echo box channel, or the English channel. I&#x27;m not sure the 
bombs 
&gt; hit england voices isn&#x27;t left over energy from WWII. that&#x27;s wy I 
say 
&gt; you can&#x27;t tell what l;evel is coming through, or the source, so 
don&#x27;t 
&gt; take any of this stuff as gospel, unless it&#x27;s unmistakable.   Frank-
