Wow thanks Don.=A0 Also, maybe you could include the date of when he wrote=
 that?=A0 In case he changed his views over time, it might be useful to kno=
w the date of each source we come up with, so we can construct a timeline.

I have one of a handful of the Edison Autobiography that has the last ch=

Anywa=

 done and the fact that the dead are just on a different wavelength than th=

Sorry, no links...=A0 This is from that old fashioned thing call=

I can tell you how to find your own copy though if you wish.=

Don

PS but don't spend alot.=A0 The info in the last chapter is n=
ot worth much.

            I suppose ultimately, it doesn't really matter if Edison ma=
de a

telephone to the dead or not.  Modern researchers in this field will
=

have to stand on their own results anyway, and if they've managed to

disc=
over something that Edison never achieved, good for them!



I have also he=
ard varied claims: that Edison did make this box; that

Edison was working =
on it but never finished it; that Edison was joking

when he mentioned work=
ing on it.  So for my own sake, I'd like to know

the real story.



If you=
 have a link to where you got your information from his

assistants and sta=
ff, I would really like to read it.  Please make

sure it is as close to th=
e source material as possible, and not

someone quoting someone quoting an =
article.  For example, here is a

link to the actual New York times article=
 on Edison discussing his

views of life after death:  

http://query. nyti=

That is the kind of link I'd be hoping for regarding your =
statements.



Thanks for any info.
