  Thanks!

I downloaded them both and Goldwave is MUCH easier to use. I'll play
around with it and see if I can clean up my clips.

It's nice to have this group. My husband wants nothing to do with
this and won't even listen to what I've found. Having people listen
and verify and help out is great!
