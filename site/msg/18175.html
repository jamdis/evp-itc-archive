All we can say is so far is that the information you got was unreliable.=C2=
=A0 We can't necessarily say why.

And what do you mean,. doing something f=
or myself? This is doing something for myself, and for others: I am testing=
 claims, to see which methods work, and which don't. So far, the ones being=
 used here, haven't been shown to work.

I see a p=

I don't want to treat them like some retarded idiots over there, i =

They are probably sitt=
