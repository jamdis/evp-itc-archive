This is one of two  \n&gt; that I\n&gt; tried &quot;ugly construction&quot;, where the components are mounted on an  \n&gt; unetched\n&gt; piece of copper clad board in an effort to reduce size. One  \n&gt; drawback with\n&gt; this box is it&#39;s AC powered, so not portable to places wihtout  \n&gt; power--like\n&gt; grave yards, so I might convert it.  I have one more of these, #12,  \n&gt; but the\n&gt; tuner needs to be replaced.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Don&#39;t get caught with egg on your face.
