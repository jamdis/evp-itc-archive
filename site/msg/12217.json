I listened to the sweep files on your ESnips and\n&gt; they were\n&gt; incredible.  Very clear and easily understandable - at\n&gt; least to me!  Very\n&gt; cool validation for Andy.  Congrats!\n&gt; \n&gt; K\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\n&gt; Misty\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, September 21, 2008 9:57 AM\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] New messages posted\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello everyone. I posted a few files from my recent sweep\n&gt; tuning \n&gt; session. I will try and post more from it later when I get\n&gt; time. There \n&gt; was one very lengthy message that seemed to be a higher\n&gt; level &#39;poetic&#39; \n&gt; type voice. Also some messages involving a new member to\n&gt; our group. \n&gt; It&#39;s up to him if he wants to share his experiences.\n&gt; However I did post \n&gt; the one file with his name because it has some significant\n&gt; meaning to \n&gt; me that I explained on the file post there. It reminded me\n&gt; of something \n&gt; Frank Sumption sent me years ago when I was a newbie and\n&gt; had the same \n&gt; effect on me that it had on the new member.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.esnips.\n&gt; &lt;http://www.esnips.com/web/SweepTuningEVP&gt;\n&gt; com/web/SweepTuningEVP\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty Dawn"}
