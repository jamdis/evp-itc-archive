<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Snow,

Those are amazing files! You have mentioned them before but this is the first time I got to hear them. Thanks for posting them again. I wasn&#x27;t around last year when that happened.

&gt; Ok, here is your &quot;evidence&quot; RJ, last year in spring a  girl was killed, her 
&gt; name was Annie Le, back then i was new to this but, got  some great files, 
&gt; which i gave let police hear on DAY  ONE of her being only still missing.  
&gt; Even in the files themselves  some spirits are telling me she is dead, her 
&gt; voice came through, I have tons of  them, these are a few, and yes I left what 
&gt; they say on them, some are clearer  then others, and if the police officer 
&gt; was able to hear them, you should be  able to as well. I don&#x27;t know why i 
&gt; even bother to worry my head over doubters  anyway.  I posted these to all 
&gt; three lists, because Bruce can  verify what happened  back then too.   You will 
&gt; also  find that the files themselves verify this by the questions asked of  
&gt; them.   Enjoy,  sf
