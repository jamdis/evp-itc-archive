Ursula,
 
The simplest and closest method to a frank's or joe's box you can=
 use to obtain real time communication
is called the manual sweep method. T=
his method actually duplicates to a certain extent the workings of an actua=
l box
but instead of mechanical dial sweep you use your hand to sweep the d=
ial. All you need is a radio with a manual dial adjust
not the digital sett=
ing kind but the old fashioned knob tuning kind, a recorder and an open min=
d.
 
Just set the radio to either the am or fm band and tune the knob so th=
at it sweeps back and forth from one end of the dial to the other
make sure=
 that you sweep fast enough so that the radio does not stop on any one stat=
ion or catch any full words or phrases that are radio signal
try not to swe=
ep so fast that everything is a complete blur and you can hear nothing. Wit=
h this method as you progress you will naturally fall into 
a groove of how=
 to manually manipulate the dial for the best results. As you are sweeping =
the dial make sure your recorder is turned on and start 
to ask simple ques=
tions that in the beginning only require a one or two word answer and you w=
ill hear the questions answered. 
You may also hear your name and if your l=
ucky a three or four word phrase or two. I'm sure your saying how will I kn=
ow the difference 
between radio words and spirit communication, well If yo=
u ask "hi are there any spirits listening" and the radio says "hi Ursula" t=
hen you can be 
pretty sure it's not radio fragment. the reason you will re=
cord the sessions is you will not be able to hear all the responces in real=
 time due to the speed of the sweep.

Hello,This is my first post to the group. My name is Ursula, and I am a Chi=
cago-based writer who has written a number of books on Chicago's supernatur=
al history and folklore. I just started a regular program of ITC experiment=
ation a week ago today, after receiving several books from Mark Macy after =
he spoke at our Chicago Ghost Conference in October. Macy immediately struc=
k me as an intensely sincere, peaceful person, and I wanted some of what ma=
de him that way. I soon found out that his demeanor flows from his connecti=
on to and knowledge of the other side, which he has garnered through ITC. W=
ith Mark's advice to guide me, I put together a very simple setup and began=
 recording for about ten minutes each morning at eleven. I got my first voi=
ce on Wednesday and, though it was a bit chilling, I was and am fascinated.=
 This was a huge step for me because, like a lot of "ghost hunters" I was f=
ascinated by voice phenomena but never wanted it in my own house! Previousl=
y, the thought of recording in my own home was terrifying, but now that I u=
nderstand the bridge-building idea of ITC (as a separate thing from recordi=
ng EVP at haunted sites)it's actually bringing me a lot of peace and focus.=
My husband and I operate Chicago Hauntings tours, and we started our compan=
y in part to try to "un-haunt" some of the tragic sites in the city. We fee=
l that by taking guests to the locations to tell the often covered-up stori=
es of the dead there we can help send on some of the negative energies/enti=
ties. ITC seems to really speak to this idea, in the way that it helps us a=
ll grow spiritually BEFORE we pass over, so that we don't get "left behind"=
 here when it's time to transition.Anyway, those are some of the inital fee=
lings and thoughts I have as I start this program. I am eager to pick up fe=
elings, thoughts (and tips) from other experimenters. Thanks again for havi=
ng me!

Your smile counts. The more smiles you share, the more we donate. J=
oin in!
