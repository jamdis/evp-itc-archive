 you were talking about "subconscious" as a term. It was because I said it =

 it. I guess the true scientific term would be your unconscious mind, or Fe=

    Sorry, I had to mull it over a bit LOL!

        Science people will tell you there is=
 no astral. The term "Astral" was coined by the first people who experience=
d this realm. But all words were coined. Even words such as dog or cat. 

 =
       Also, subconscious means below conscious or not conscious. So it isn=
't incorrect, though maybe some scholarly types will tell you it isn't prop=
er. Again, all words were coined.

        You have to remember that colleg=
es and schools are mostly made up by people, people who think only scientif=
ically. I know-not all people in colleges think this way, but that is what =
learning institutions are based on. They reject any term they can't grasp o=
r understand under a microscope.

        All this is besides the point tho=
ugh.
