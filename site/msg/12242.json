I suppose according to the \ntraditional evp coil induction theory that it could work, but about 4 \nyears ago I did extensive testing with this type of pickup on a yamaha \n4 track recorder with diodes and microphones on other tracks. The only \nsuccess I had was with the tracks that had a regular microphone \nattached. As I understand it, this device transforms the em frequency \nto it&#39;s corresponsing audible frequency, sortof a &quot;reverse mic&quot;.\n\nI have never had any success in it&#39;s use, but it certainly is a cheap \nway to experiment. I don&#39;t see a connection to a Frank&#39;s box by \nfunctionality, Frank&#39;s boxes and similar model ghost boxes are much \nmore complex and sophisticated. You can think of the above as an \naudible emf sensor.\n\nHope it helps,\nAndy\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@...m, &quot;angels4lyn&quot; &lt;angels4lyn@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; what can ya&#39;ll tell me about this item ?\n&gt; \n&gt; REAL TIME EVP CONVERTER - HEAR EVP&#39;S AS THEY HAPPEN \n&gt; DESIGNED FROM THE FRANK BOX  \n&gt; (pic attached)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Lyn\n&gt;"}
