<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Nathan.  I bought mine from Radio Shack and did the hack myself.  There are 
instructions and videos on the net if you want to do this.  If you are unable to do the hack 
for yourself, you can look on eBay for the prehacked new model 12-469, though you may 
find the clicking on it annoying.  The other hackable models, thus far, have not shown on 
eBay. 

If you can operate a screw driver and a wire snipper, you should be able to do the hack 
yourself (assuming you don&#x27;t have eyesight issues which would prevent you from 
determining what is going to the mute pin, or manual dexterity issues which would 
prevent you from being able to snip just one wire.)  You certainly could start 
experimenting with a manual sweep, by just turning the dial of a radio for yourself.

Look, most of us are trying to polite and civil to you (at least I am, I&#x27;ve not read through all 
the posts so I&#x27;m not sure how others are reacting).  If you have a genuine interest in 
experimenting with the automated sweep, great.  But from the tone the posts of yours 
that I have read thus far, it seems you not being respectful (or maybe you&#x27;re just unaware) 
of the fact that you are among a group of people here who simply do not share your &#x27;world 
view.&#x27;

This is akin to a person of one religion walking into the place of worship of another, vastly 
different religion, and preaching to the members about the dangers of their beliefs.  It is 
extremely inappropriate and I&#x27;m not quite sure why you are not understanding the 
similarity between this analogy and your behavior in this forum.  

Perhaps you should start your own Yahoo group where you can discuss your concerns with 
like-minded individuals?  

One last thing, and again, I realize you may not be aware, but typing in all caps is 
considered in cyberworlds as screaming at those whom you are addressing in your post or 
email.  And on a practical side, all caps are more difficult to read.  

May peace be with you.

Margaret
