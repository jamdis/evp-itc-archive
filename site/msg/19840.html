<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It not just you, everyone wants everything handed to them, no thinking, no
work. They just want an excuse not to question anything so they can go on
playing video games, watching movies and ignoring how bad the world really
is.


 There is not even any discussion possible, not here, not on FB, not
anywhere. Everyone wants the same precanned BS from what they invision as
authorities. Just make it all go away so y&#x27;all can completely ignore all
reality. Ya don&#x27;t have to question, ya don&#x27;t have think, ya don&#x27;t have to
seek any answers.  I&#x27;m done.

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m thinking there is faces embedded in sound, it&#x27;s related to speech,
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; not just EVP. It seems to be a normal function of our own minds(living or
&gt; &gt; dead), the same as reverse speech. I found some faces in old EVPs from
&gt; boxes
&gt; &gt; and also in music files. The ones from Evanescence are pretty impressive
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; person, and do not seem to be intentionaly embedded.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I know, it&#x27;s not ghost hunters, and most don&#x27;t want to have to think.
&gt; &gt; I think most want this stuff in a neat little box, all well defined, all
&gt; &gt; rules and protocols known, but it just won&#x27;t stay in one box, or universe
&gt; &gt; for that matter.

&gt; Dear Frank,
&gt;
&gt; I think that I see what you mean. I mean no offense, but I it would be
&gt; helpful to see something a little more definitive that couldn&#x27;t be mistaken
&gt; for matrixing. Is this possible? Is it just me?
