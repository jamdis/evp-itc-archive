<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>No, on the first stage of passing they seem to still have all their 
faculties that the&#x27;ve had in the mortal coil here on this plane.  
They can be funny, at least it&#x27;s better than the negatives cursing 
which i&#x27;ve experienced before also.

&gt; My personal belief is that just because one is dead (or an alien)  
&gt; that doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t have a sense of humor.

&gt; &gt; Yeah, definitely no offense to Frank and he knows that. I just 
post
&gt; &gt; what i think they say. And Frank also knows the FM on my box 
wasn&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; good at all and the Random doesn&#x27;t work. Maybe they were just
&gt; &gt; pointing that out.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The second part might have been something about reception, 
rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; than Sumption, but it still scores an overall giggle from me.
