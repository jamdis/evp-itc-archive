I forward this for two reasons: the first as a request from \nBruce to determine recurring words and second because I wanted to \nhave experienced ears hear my recording for comments. Regarding the \ntest, this is just 30 secs or so of a 7 minute recording. Recorded \nat 90% using EVPmaker with xcross. I was able to hear &quot;art and \narthor&quot; a number of times within the 7 minutes. This is after \nrequesting no names be spoken. \n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding my experiences with evpmaker and the allaphone file sent \nby Stefan, I must say my results have been underwhelming. I hear \nnothing but evp gibberish. I ask that anyone with an ear for this to \ngive a listen and tell me if you hear anything intelligent. I am in \na terrible radio zone here in Mexico so I have high hopes on EVP \nmaker and the file Stefan provided. Also excited about the fact that \nso many others are getting excellent communications. Thank you to \nanyone who takes the time to listen to and confirm my recordings. I \nam beginning to feel like I am being blocked out like William had \nthought. Maybe I am in a true dead zone, no pun intended, or &quot;they&quot; \ndon&#39;t want me in the loop for some reason.
