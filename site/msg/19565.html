I'm working with a few really great technical wizards right now and we'll s=
ee what they can do with this software and programs. 
=C2=A0
Getting images=
 from our audio and employing visual modalities with EVP & GBC "seems" like=
 the other half and missing piece to what we do. It makes so much sense to =
me and if it works as suggested will allow our depth of communication to ex=
tend so much=C2=A0further than it has prior to this...almost like a conscio=
us mind (GBC, surface messages) and the subconscious mind (sound/audio imag=
ing and everything that lies beneath the surface) sort of thing. 
=C2=A0
I =
really get a good, STRONG feeling about this. It seems so obvious! =C2=A0
