My ears prefer a higher tone of voice, so I go with 106%.  If I want to slow down \nthe response, to make it a little easier to understand when I&#39;m reviewing/editing the \nsession, I change the tempo about -18.  Changing the tempo (not the speed) will slow the \nrate of speech without changing the pitch of the voice.  If you alter speed, it also \nraises/lowers the pitch of the voice.\n\nI believe Dave (if I&#39;m recalling correctly) uses a speed of 75%, but sets his recording \nsoftware to +3 octave to restore proper pitch (at 75% without correction the voice would \nbe very low).   \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; jeremy,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I go between 87 and 90% depending on how the communication comes in.\n&gt;  \n&gt; bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: ecuyler@...: Sat, 5 Apr 2008 12:48:50 -0700Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] \nAfew EVPM allaphone files\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Excellent files, Bruce.
