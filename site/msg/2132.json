Sometimes the teams in CA refer to those who often get\ndecent results as &quot;evp magnets&quot;. \n\nI think the individuals who can easily obtain good results (no matter\nwhere they are) may be able to channel their psychic abilities into PK\nenergy and record the results as an evp. I&#39;m not suggesting this is\nwhat happens every time but it may be what&#39;s happening in some of the\ncases.\n\n-Bill \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;delchay2005&quot; &lt;azredant@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- \n&gt; Hi Tracy,\n&gt; \n&gt; If you study human agent poltergeist cases of psychokinesis, the \n&gt; identified human agent is always in the house of structure when the \n&gt; objects move.\n&gt; \n&gt; The famous Miami Hotel case that Dr. William Roll investigated is a \n&gt; great example. When a certain kitchen worker was present, all sorts \n&gt; of objects were thrown around the room. When he was not there, \n&gt; nothing happened. When he left the Hotel for good, no more activity \n&gt; was ever recorded.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would like to try to rule out, or, support the theory that we are \n&gt; not, or that we might be imprinting EVP&#39;s on audio tracks or tape.\n&gt; \n&gt; My own personal experience in EVP gathering leads me to believe that \n&gt; this is phenomena driven, not my subconscious mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; But now I have to try and find out the truth for myself.\n&gt; \n&gt; This last year we saw an incredible amount of EVP&#39;s being recorded \n&gt; during our cases we investigated. \n&gt; \n&gt; http://arizonaparanormalinvestigations.com/api_gallery/index.php?\n&gt; cat=4\n&gt; \n&gt; The above is our link to our new EVP gallery if you would like to \n&gt; listen to them. These were all recorded in the last year using  \n&gt; multiple recorders in each location. There is a Grade A and a Grade \n&gt; B icon to seperate them.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; James\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Tracy &lt;loneshewolf999@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am not sure this would still rule it out.  I don&#39;t think \n&gt; psychokinesis is restrained by walls, the mind isn&#39;t restrained by \n&gt; walls whether human or deceased.  I am guessing that psychokinesis \n&gt; behaves similar to telepathy....\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   I believe many evp&#39;s are deceased spirits, but the question on \n&gt; whether it could be a living person imprinting the evps was \n&gt; certainly one that made me really think !  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Frank Ratka &lt;warrior18eii@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;               Hi James,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Back when I still investigated haunted sites, our team did this on \n&gt; various occasions within a house where we recorded several hours of \n&gt; activity over a few years (a long term investigation). We would \n&gt; leave our audio equipment recording in several &quot;hot spots&quot; all over \n&gt; the house and then leave for an hour or two. I have to say, in our \n&gt; experience we never got an EVP while we were out of the house. As a \n&gt; matter of fact we had an EVP when we reentered the house \n&gt; saying, &quot;here they come, lets go&quot;. I don&#39;t necessarily understand \n&gt; why a ghost or spirit would talk with no one present to receive the \n&gt; message unless during setup you explained what you are trying to \n&gt; accomplish and what the spirits roll is in the experiment (we never \n&gt; tried explaining). A piece of machinery (recorders) in an empty room \n&gt; does not have a consciousness or spiritual presence I would be \n&gt; interested to see if you get different results.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Frank\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; &gt; From: delchay2005 &lt;azredant@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 18, 2007 6:47:24 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] EVP Experiment planned in October.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     To try and rule out that the EVP researchers are imprinting \n&gt; voices \n&gt; &gt; psychokinetically on audio players mistaken as ghosts voices, I \n&gt; will \n&gt; &gt; pre-tape an interactive evp session.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I will record a bank of thirty questions, 20 seconds of silence \n&gt; &gt; after each question, on a cassete tape and played on a cassette \n&gt; &gt; player that will be utilized in all three buildings in a known \n&gt; &gt; haunted location just outside of Phoenix, Arizona.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There will be digital recorders, cassette recorders, omni \n&gt; &gt; directional microphones, condensor microphones, as well as an \n&gt; &gt; electrocet boom microphone present in all of the sessions. There \n&gt; &gt; will be no human agents in the buildings when these sessions take \n&gt; &gt; place.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My hope is to:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Record an authentic EVP with no human agent in the building. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If this is phenomena driven, will the phenomena communicate by \n&gt; &gt; responding to questions from a machine rather than a human agent? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you have any ideas to enhance this experiment, please feel free \n&gt; &gt; to let me know. This experiment will take place on October 27th. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; James\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;   Be a better Heartthrob.
