&gt; LC,
&gt;  
&gt; Mike and Lisa are technicians that where assigned to me.
&gt; I have asked them repeatedly to extend a helping hand to any other 
researchers
&gt; that may need it or have not been assigned a permanent technician.
&gt;  
&gt; That is most likely why a few other researchers have been having 
them come
&gt; through from time to time.
&gt; Also they have led me to believe they are like supervisors of a 
communication station
&gt; that supports a number of techs and their respective researchers.
&gt;  
&gt; Every researcher will have a personal technician that will build a 
relationship solely with them.
&gt; In order to be assigned a tech, our friends on the other side need 
to find a tech that has a
&gt; compatible energy to the researcher that they are going to assist. 
Both the techs spiritual
&gt; energy and the researchers energy must be in harmony for the 
relationship or partnership as it where
&gt; to work. Sort of like a marriage of energies.
&gt;  
&gt; I&#x27;m sure that if you ask a series of questions about your tech you 
will receive conformation.
&gt; Mike and Lisa where there most likely to lend your tech their 
energy if he or she was having difficulty
&gt; coming through.

I&#x27;m told my technician&#x27;s name is David (which is also the name

hearover and over and over. I hear the name or number Seven; I often 
hearthe name Frank. I was speculating that that is Sumption, but it 
may beanother technician.So, we&#x27;ve got Mike, Lisa, Seven, David, and 
possibly Frank, who seemto be operating for most of us.Anyone else 
have a technician that I am missing?Ann&gt; I personally believe I 
received responses &gt; yesterday from &quot;Mike &amp; Lisa.&quot;&gt; &gt; Yet, I still 
wonder if they are referencing the time being short, &gt; with respect 
to whatever is coming. Maybe they mean the thinning of &gt; the veil

How many have been identified? &gt; I know mine have been male-female
