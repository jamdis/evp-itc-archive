If a\nphenomenon is observed that doesn&#39;t fit the law or theory, then one of a\ncouple things is happening - either the law or theory is wrong or the\nobservations were wrong. There are codified ways to determine which of those\nit was and to either re-do the experiment with better observation or to\nrevise the law or theory. Same if a prediction doesn&#39;t happen as expected.\nScience has no emotions or opinions to it.\n\n&quot;Scientists&quot; are human and can have opinions and emotions and faults and get\ninto being authority figures, etc. Frank, I think you have &quot;science&quot; and\n&quot;scientists&quot; confused. It looks to me like your complaints are with\n&quot;scientists,&quot; who are not in fact scientists at all if they are interjecting\nopinions and authoritarianism. A real scientist will do what I outlined in\nthe first paragraph. No opinions. No name-calling. No skepticism.\nTechnology is the APPLICATION of a science. James Clerk Maxwell&#39;s *A\nTreatise on Electricity and Magnetism* was science. Antenna engineering is\none of the applications, the technology.\n\nBut we are dealing with something here that is outside the realm of science.\nCall it what you will - religion, metaphysics, etc. but we&#39;re looking at\nSPIRITS - something science wishes to ignore as it&#39;s not physical. We really\ndon&#39;t know much if anything at all about this field. A lot of what I&#39;ve seen\nand heard doesn&#39;t seem to fit any laws I know of.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Tue, Jul 27, 2010 at 12:37 PM, Frank Sumption\n&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;SCIENCE&quot; Is not name calling and belittling people while ignoring ALL\n&gt; evidence, doing no testing, accepting no one else&#39;s evidence! This crap the\n&gt; so called skeptics pull is third grade school playground non-sense, and yet\n&gt; they claim the intellectual high ground--while ignoring all evidence.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Technology is not science, it is cut and try, see what works. If we waited\n&gt; for science our wheels would still be made out of stone. Science was\n&gt; declaring how heavier than air flight was impossible the moment the Wright\n&gt; Brother were flying.
