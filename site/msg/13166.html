<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, Misty is correct.  They are my files from the crash impact 
point. These are the only files I captured there.
Each session is represented by three files..
(1) the raw capture.. 
(2)the raw capture with noise removed and slight amplification... 
(3)processed file using echo/frequency additions stimulated by file 
(2).
This way others can listen or use any of the file variations for 
their own research.
I&#x27;ll be adding files from sessions at the gravesites and lab using 
crash debris next week.
I used mostly the processed files in the video.  By linking all the 
files on my website, I provide others an avenue to listen and use all 
of them.

RJ says he hears only noise...

Noise in a certain patterns could be taken as a word or words. 
Myself, I hear certain patterns of noise in portions of some of the 
files.  Are they words or phrases?  Could be.  Is what I think I 
heard relivent to this event (a crash)?
Yes... So, I believe I have captured something related to this event 
with at least a portion of my ITC session.

I&#x27;ve read and heard that not everyone always hears the same thing... 
but it doesn&#x27;t mean something is not there.

&gt; I think those are his own files he recorded either near the source 
of 
&gt; impact or using debris. He is just sharing as he goes. Giving the 
raw 
&gt; audio for those who would rather have that than the processed or 
&gt; denoised files. Interesting sounds tho.

&gt; &gt; On going through them all, I think I see now that you did not 
post 
&gt; 12 samples. You posted perhaps four, with 2 or 3 duplicates as 
&gt; they&#x27;ve been variously processed. Is this the case? The 
processing 
&gt; to me sounds like audio-cleanup processing, based on the amount of 
&gt; audio pixelation it seems to have introduced, some rather severe? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; However, I didn&#x27;t hear anything in any of these other than 
noise. 
&gt; Is there anything particular you wanted to highlight? Were you 
&gt; looking for any input?

&gt; &gt; Thanks for posting.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think in your original experimental specs, you request five 30 
&gt; second audio clips from five-to-ten people. Which would be 25-50 
&gt; clips. Here you&#x27;ve posted 12. Will you be posting the others?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also, I&#x27;d like to hear from the people who created these clips. 
&gt; How did you go about that? Did you do exactly five 30 second 
clips? 
&gt; Or did you do more, and send in just the best?
&gt; &gt;
