<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Holy Cow, I leave for my daughters school event at 3:30 and I have 
too much email on this subject!
 
First and foremost I was directing those who are in fact are 
paranormal investigators, in field research.  Many here are not!  I 
was in no way implying that Bruce, Steve, etc. were fabricating their 
audio clips in any way!!!!  I HIGH RESPECT BRUCE, STEVE AND THE the 
other on this board!  I am speaking from my experiences, and being in 
the line of fire throughout the years regarding cutting and pasting 
clips together.
 
I don&#x27;t care what you do to be completely honest, I just know that 
given the drama and know how nasty people can be, I will not cut and 
paste which is my preference.  Just because someone who does, given 
their reputation (such as Bruce&#x27;s) I certainly would have no reason 
to question the authenticity of his work.  However, there are those 
who I do question, such as the post of Mr.Roundtrees photo&#x27;s (posted 
the previous day) and given the manufacturing of those so called 
ghost photo&#x27;s I would serious NEVER take any audio he produced as 
creditable. This is the point I was trying to make.  
 
I will also tell you that a year ago upon listening to some of the 
files here, the first thing I noticed was that when I played certain 
files I could clearly see with the editing software that they were 
not raw audio.  I immediately formed an opinion that they in fact 
could be bogus!  That was my initial impression.  It wasn&#x27;t until I 
formed a personal friendship with some of them that I know THEY WOULD 
NEVER comprise their integrity and that this specific research was 
extremely important to them.  I will be the first to admit that I was 
very wrong, but I did base my judgment given what I saw.  Other may 
just do the same.
 
The average person who happens upon this search who in fact has been 
subject to those who do not stand behind their research will not know 
better.  They too may just form the same opinion based on what they 
have come across in this industry. 
 
Many I have had the pleasure of talking to outside this board, and I 
will tell you that it is an honor to be among good honest creditable 
people, who truly do care!  I know NONE OF YOU whom I have spoken 
with would EVER do this, but unfortunately there are those who will.
 
I hope this clears things up, and people are not going to make a 
mountain out of a mole hill.
