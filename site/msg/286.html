  I have problem with my pc when related to spirit things, ie.. web

  Also have alot of physicall problems latley, headaches and throwing 
up, but im not sick! Since i moved into my new house the only EVP i have 
gotten was "watch"watch" whereas my last house they were talking my ear 
off! NOT anymore?! I am kinda wondering whatchall think is going on in 
her house and if it might be the same thing i have going on here? Also, 
i wont swear on it, but i think one of them touched the top of my head 
the other day while i was doing dishes, and another touched my ankle. I 
really would like to know whats going on around me, but they dont seem 
to wanna talk to me anymore. I have been searching for someone to come 
out here and do some "work around me and see what they can get? <evp

The entity decides who it wants you to communicate with and disables 
the rest.  It's afraid of awakenings.

          Jessie,
  
  It�s really weird because I was talking to Cindy last night & she 
told me some things that happened at the GHU this weekend with at the 
Biltmore in FL. What this pertains to is a type of entity that exists that 
we are starting to understand because this type is showing up a lot 
more. I had one in NH that messed with me & my family. What they do is 
play games that are focused on your weakness. Now it sounds farfetched but 
the more I learn about this particular type of entity I understand it 
for what it is. 
  
  It is something ancient that did not need to be born but exists. Now 
I have refrained from discussing this for the most part because of its 
nature. You see it plays on you mentally, uses your electricity or 
computer to come in. In fact I have had major power drain on my computer 
back up because of it. I know this to be true because I would have power 
surges after certain things I would work on to find the battery dead 
and scored. Do I feel like I had anything to do with it/ No I don�t as it 
was a condition that already existed.
  
  The night we were talking together it kept locking up your computer 
and keyboard but also Cindy had to go lie down & while talking to her I 
saw an orb plain as day floating around  briefly (not an every day 
thing for me).
  
  What you do have is male there (the one you told me about). He 
doesn�t like you trying to get help but also he has help & that is in the 
form of this other being. They can play tricks. I don�t even think 
smudging is enough at this point we will need to perform a banishment spell 
just like I did at my house in NH. Please burn the candle I gave you 
tonight or ASAP. I gave that to you help protect yourself.
  
  I also would like to see other thoughts on this type of manifestation 
as this is serious & many people out there might have it going on and 
don�t understand it.

        My name is Jessie, and I am a member of the group in that Cindy 
and 
Andrea are in. I have had activity in my house since I bought this 
townhouse in Milwaukee, WI. We were all in our monthly chat, talking 
about cleansing my house, and last Monday, got smacked in the back of 
the head by whatever is here. Not hurtful, but hard enough to know 
that they were here. Nothing has happened since. Andrea has EVP's of 
voices here, and Cindy, with her gift, has realizied that there is 
something here. Nothing has happened since. Except a couple of times 
that there has been a strobe lite show, they have left? Or are they 
on pause? Andrea would like to smudge the place one more time. I 
think, regardeless, that is a good idea. I would just like to hear 
others point of view on this. Andrea has been here twice, and would 
like to here her view point, and Cindy has known me for a few years, 
what hers are. I have insomnia bad, except since then it has 
worsened. I am not afraid of these "entites", except would like 
others opinions. Cindy and Andrea, if you could expand on this, 
please do so.

Jessie
