Hi Andy,

I too am a 469 user. I find that if I'm not getting very good reception on one band, I'll ask the spirits if I should switch bands. They usually give me a yes or no answer, or some form thereof. If you have any more questions about the use of the 469, let us know.

Chad

Thanks K, just have to say I was not prepared for the immediate 
relevant responses I got. The skeptical side was expecting vague highly 
interpreted responses. Doing a followup tonight. Question though, to 
other users of the 469, do you prefer am band (got best results with 
am) or fm band? I know that nighttime am reception is much better, so 
it seems logical to stick with that during nighttime hours. Any 
thoughts?

thanks again
Andy
