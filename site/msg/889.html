<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>not everyone is predestined to geek-hood and of those that are many 
of those are not allowed matches in the &quot;home&quot;  :}(kidding of course)

build a crystal radio set, get a pack of germanium point contact 1n34 
diodes from radio shack. put earphone in ear.  tune to strong local 
station.  strike a match and heat wire right whereit exits glass on 
side opposite to black band.  continue till you hear white noise or 
station gets louder or match burns down.  thats usually enough.

plug diode into tape recorder in classic diode/mic evp fashion

OR...

i can probably work something else out if frank (the peoples choice) 
okays it.

the techies and mediumistic types need to help each other out till 
then

&gt; Thats kind of you to offer Bill =) Id say me, but I&#x27;d need a video 
instruction book to go with it LOL with you going you put this thingy 
into that thingamajigger. Is there welding involved? (I dont do it)
&gt;    
&gt;   I KNEW I should have played with the older boys building radios 
when I was in school. But I was way too shy then and only in grade 
school so I did crafts with the older girls. Advanced classes were 
interesting but my shyness didnt help. So for the technically 
challenged (like me) perhaps you could lay out a mock instruction 
plan with a pic or two?
&gt;    
&gt;   I know quite a few on the group dont need it, and probably 
understand what you are saying completely.

&gt; 
&gt; i have a yahoo messenger webcam set up for members of franks-evp 
only 
&gt; for better explanatios/demonstrations. if anyone wants an evp 
&gt; competent (or wtf) 1n34 to plug into their tape machine AND is a 
&gt; member of this group only , i&#x27;ll send them out as long as i can 
&gt; afford it/can spare time. worth the effort IMO for patient detail 
&gt; conscious researchers which evp-ers seem to be. the described 
&gt; procedure should work on first or second try for those that can put 
&gt; together crystal receiver and plug it into amplifier.--with smal 
cap 
&gt; to ground plug, you could even do it with a tape recorder. all long 
&gt; wires that can act as antennas can then be removed and only diode 
or 
&gt; diode and tuned circuit employed. whole assembly can be rotated to 
&gt; block out radio stations.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; we&#x27;re getting those drenching t-storms with the low lightning 
&gt; between

&gt; &gt; &gt; center so april 6 should be best evp time in awhile

&gt; &gt; &gt; tonite:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; heated anode gold whisker end with one match . in live circuit 
&gt; tuned 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to strong local station.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; when match was two thirds burned, white noise started. match 
was 
&gt; put 
&gt; &gt; &gt; out. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; now there is a steady 20mv* across input with diode in place. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; previously 0 mv. no difference when diode is reversed.. diode 
&gt; &gt; &gt; removed, v drops to zero. formerly strong local station was 
&gt; barely 
&gt; &gt; &gt; audible with good audio amp. now it is at normal listening 
&gt; volume. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; diode is noisy, but beneath what you can hear when tuned to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; station. &quot;lumpy&quot; white noise; white noise with larger scale 
&gt; order 
&gt; &gt; &gt; appearing and vanishing- unpredictably , like candle flame- but 
&gt; &gt; &gt; averaging about 3-15 times per second
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; other am receivers still full of crashing static from long gone 
t-
&gt; &gt; &gt; storm.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; tank circuit +diode + audio amp= no lightning crashes 
&gt; whatsoever. no 
&gt; &gt; &gt; line noise. no fluorescent light 60hz buzz.

&gt; &gt; &gt; im making som noise sources as soon as i collapse for awhile by

&gt; &gt; &gt; that issues from an infinitely smal point source seems to work
