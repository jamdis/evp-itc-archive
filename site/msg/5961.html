Ann,
 
You bring up a good point about posted the two versions of a file.
=
I personally do not feel that I must prove to anyone that my communications=
 are legitimate.
everyone has heard my posted files and in those files my a=
cknowledgement of the real time responses I hear.
That in itself should be =
enough. when a question is asked by the researcher then answered directly b=
y the
entity and the answer repeated by the researcher directly as conforma=
tion of the spirit answer. to me those files stand as a testament
to the va=
lidity and honor of the research as well as the individuals that are doing =
it.
 
I will continue to post files as I have been but will make the raw un=
touched version available to whoever wants it.
I will not do double posts t=
o defend my research validity to a saboteur.

Bruce--I do think per=

us, to be better heard. That's not the argument--at least not from me. But =
it might be helpful, in general, to hear the two versions side by side. 

T=
his said, to Babs: You're going to have to live with the fact that not all =
of the communication is in response to questions. If a question was spoken =
near where the communication came through, I try to include it. But there a=
re plenty of times when I am not being addressed at all, as best I can tell=
. They're talking amonst themselves and issuing orders, etc. So, clips with=
out questions aren't going to change and you need to accept them for what t=
hey are.

As far as removing time: I don't see an issue with it if the clip=
 is noted, rather as in journalism where we add ... to denote that material=
 has been removed that was tangential to the main thrust of the quote.

Per=
sonally, I have to slow my communication stuff down by about half. It comes=
 through incredibly fast. I don't think I'm alone. Another deal-with-it iss=
ue. Slowing is not manipulating. Neither is amplification of fainter respon=

Some if us are recording mo=
no and some stereo. Silencing one track to better hear another is also not =
manipulating it falls in the journalistic convention "..." category, to me =
anyway.

Still, point taken on combining both unprocessed and processed cli=

As for all the rest of the fretting about counting stations and dividi=

 of the time, the voice we hear is not the real voice of the communicant. I=
t doesn't matter if you hear blips of the same announcer coming through at =
15 second intervals. It's what the voice might say that is important. I kno=

Very good observation B=

 simple fact that you have an interest in ITC, are a researcher and a compl=

 I would like to know who removes time from their recordings. I have never =
removed time from my recordings and see no reason why anyone else would wit=
hout saying so in an accompanied post.I have limited experience with the 12=
-469's as a single piece of equipment. I have arranged mine per Mike's, "Sp=
iricomp" design. I have 3, 12-469's feeding a four channel mixer, which goe=
s into a laptop running DC6 with Soundsoap 2. Mine scan equally spaced on t=
he FM band. I have had pretty good results until recently.At first the mess=

t 2 weeks ago the 12-469 arrangement started generating a lot of interferen=

 shortwave. Not voice fragments but voices made of static (metallic and rob=

sing fan noise. One of the first messages to come across was from a familia=
r voice telling me and I quote, "your method sucks". I have not used the 12=
-469's since because of the clear messages I have been getting using water =
and fan noise. That does not mean I have given up on the 12-469's but I won=

Alr=
ight, you all know I'm vocal and I haven't made any "friends" herebut, if w=
e can put that aside for a moment...Spirit communication has been my passio=
n since day one, a little over6 years ago. I am a believer in the afterlife=
 and a believer inspirits attempting to communicate with us for a variety o=
f reasons. Ihave spiritual beliefs that I feel strongly about and devote mu=
ch ofmy waking (and sleeping) moments to thoughts about this field.However,=
 I am also a researcher and a skeptic. In order for me toallow ideas to bec=
ome part of my reality I must experiment. In orderfor me to believe somethi=
ng is paranormal I HAVE to rule out all otherpossible causes. That being sa=
id, I have some questions. My hope isthat there are some here willing to en=
ter into discussion with me.I have a difficult time with many of the files =
here. Many times, thereis no question included in the file. I can not deter=
mine whether ornot the "reply" is an intelligent reply. Maybe this has to d=
o withallowable file size.Some of the files I have been able to download. (=
I don't always keepmy email settings on for this group as I get too many - =
lol) When Ilook at the file I see problems. There will be complete flat lin=
esilence between the words. Many times the "reply" is also at the samedecib=
el as the question askers voice. Those two things should notoccur naturally=
 considering the devices being used. That tells me thatthere is manipulatio=
n of the files. Now, what is manipulation to me,may not be manipulation to =
others. To me, any altering of the recordedfile constitutes manipulation. I=
 do not know if the reply wasintelligent or manipulated to be intelligent. =
Some say that they simply remove the "no response" time. I've beentold it c=
an be as much as 18 seconds removed from between words. Nowwe run into the =
problem of us deciding what word fits in with thequestion. What words are b=
eing ignored? Did we take nonsense and makesense? Did we amp every noise/wo=
rd or only what fit?I think it's great that files are offered for peer revi=
ew. However, Ithink we have to load them untouched or at the very least, of=
ferexactly what was done to the entire file. Time elapsed between words,wha=
t was amped, etc. I'd also love to see some of these sessions videotaped wi=
th the question asker facing the camera and a second handclock visible. Tru=
ly, we aren't researching if we don't have someprotocol in place.Here is an=
 issue I have with the RS Hacks. I have the 469. It takesapproximately 18 s=
econds to scan through the AM frequencies. Now, thetypical person would thi=
nk that we can take that 18 seconds and divideit by the number of AM statio=
ns to determine how long we are on eachstation before moving on to the next=
 one. In that way we coulddetermine what is impossible to be said via a rad=
io fragment. However,that's not correct. The scan cycle can vary from one f=
requency to thenext and of course the biggest problem is that some stations=
 arepicked up over multiple frequencies; AM 640 can be heard on 630, 640,65=
0, 660 and maybe even 670. That extends the time a great deal. Thisis a dif=
ficult problem because it is almost impossible for the averageperson to be =
able to make a determination on time this way. I heard about the following =
today; An experimenter records at the sametime every day Mon-Fri. We hear a=
bout the importance of meditating,automatic writing, etc at the same time e=
very day but what we have toremember with this, is that now we are in essen=
ce tuning into the sameradio show every day. One of my first experiments wi=
th the 469 had mehearing this deep male voice over and over again. What was=
 he tryingto tell me, I wondered. Than I realized that he was speakingappro=
ximately every 18 seconds; every time the scan hit that station.So, if you =
are removing up to 18 seconds between words, then you arereally only record=
ing the words from one station. This post is IN NO WAY trying to start anyt=
hing besides discussionabout some research problems. I know that there are =
those who are notconcerned with anything more than the communication itself=
 but I thinkthat it is of the utmost importance to attempt to factor in som=
eprotocol in order for this to be considered serious research at all.

an through the AM frequencies. Now, the<BR>typical person would think that =
we can take that 18 seconds and divide<BR>it by the number of AM stations t=
o determine how long we are on each<BR>station before moving on to the next=
 one. In that way we could<BR>determine what is impossible to be said via a=
 radio fragment. However,<BR>that's not correct. The scan cycle can vary fr=
om one frequency to the<BR>next and of course the biggest problem is that s=
ome stations are<BR>picked up over multiple frequencies; AM 640 can be hear=
d on 630, 640,<BR>650, 660 and maybe even 670. That extends the time a grea=
t deal. This<BR>is a difficult problem because it is almost impossible for =
the average<BR>person to be able to make a determination on time this way.<=

that now we are in essence tuning into the same<BR>radio show every day. On=
e of my first experiments with the 469 had me<BR>hearing this deep male voi=

I realized that he was speaking<BR>approximately every 18 seconds; every ti=
me the scan hit that station.<BR>So, if you are removing up to 18 seconds b=
