Cool, Ill have a listen to that. Im based in the UK and I go to various poi=
nts where there may be a long history of something happening and still ener=
gy around. Edinburgh Castle was a success but had plenty of sad and angry v=
oices coming through. and even the tower of london. each time I go to a tou=
r of some sort I tend to take my recorder and see if I can pick up anything=
.. sometimes I dont, Sometimes they can be friendly.

Keep up the good work=
 :-)

Subject: [EVP-ITC] recorder is fine





After telling it to leave I hav=
en't noticed any problems. I ran an unusually long recording today (17 minu=
tes) without a problem. Got a few EVP's but not enough voice to understand =
anything. But I am sure all is well. Not having much luck during this heat =
:) I am uploading the file called "recorder malfunction" it is rather large=
 902kb so will erase real soon. BEWARE: at 10 second mark it gets very LOUD=
!! When he starts messing with it I guess.. Then he has some noise spikes l=
ater in the recording that are not as loud.. As for his VOICE....it is in t=
he file called "get out of my face" in "Jim's RR-DR60 EVP's" at the files l=
ocation. The voice was found in the 3rd recording attempt out in the countr=
y....it was at the begining around the 5 second mark. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoog=
