It went well we got some results and the confirmation we wished for. I'm not releasing the test results until Laura finishes the analyzation of her session. It was late and she was tired. However I did some pre-test sessions to clear the channels that I can share some of the sounds. Attaching a few to this post.
   
  I will try and post it all on a webpage later along with the results of our sessions. She couldnt make the 8 session so I began as they asked and did a channel clearing session, no questions asked, just recording. However they were already starting the session so by the time she came and we both sat down and asked the same questions out loud as we recorded most of them were focused on the test at hand.

            hey everyone
  im looking for some feedback on yalls session :)
  would love to hear the evp's you got last night.
  Also, would like to see if you are still planning on "meeting" online on sunday to record? 
  I think this is an amazing deal. It could bridge so many people together on both side of the spectrum. I think that it would be cool to see how many people are interested in doing this on a regular basis?
  I know of another person interested in sundays recording session too.
