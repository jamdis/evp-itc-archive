Antennas can be engineered to get \npractically any pattern you want. In fact, many FM and TV antennas have a \npattern which peaks from directly below the antenna to the horizon and \nsends very little signal straight up.\n\nAlso, close-in you might still be in the Fresnel zone of the field.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Mon, 15 Dec 2008, don powell wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Just an engineering point.� Radio radiates out kind of like a donut turned on it&#39;s side.� So directly under, up to a dozen or so feet from a tower has zero transmission.\n&gt;\n&gt; It kind of looks like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; � |\n&gt; �(|)\n&gt; ------\n&gt;\n&gt; Where the parenthesis are the radio waves.� Except they do not really get that close to the tower base.\n&gt;\n&gt; The point of the strongest signal is a little past the height of the tower.� So if the tower is 100&#39; then if you move away from the tower to about 110&#39; or so that is the most powerful signal.\n&gt;\n&gt; Don\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; .  I also tried the local police and some microwave towers,\n&gt;\n&gt; right under the towers, and heard nothing from those sources. But they\n&gt;\n&gt; are on much higher frequencies than AM or FM radio and are not known to\n&gt;\n&gt; get into any electronics around here.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Zack\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _,___\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\r\n--297796611-283962103-1229352496=:6498--"}
