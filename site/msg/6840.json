She says that it is \nreal, but there are some issues on the production end.  Basically any \nattempts at the technical side of investigation gets cut.  The kids \naren&#39;t used to being on camera, so you do see a lot of retakes that seem \nrehearsed.  She was also not thrilled that they chose to emphasize so \nmuch demonic stuff right off the bat.  That was way out of balance.\n\n&gt;  I guess according to A & E\n&gt;  that if we are talking to the spirit of the dead then WE are the\n&gt;  problem and should stop it or atleast that is how they addressed it.\n&gt;  Or is just how I see it? \n\nNo, I was also howling over that.  So talking to dead people is bad, \neh?  Maybe I should take their word for it that all dead people are \nnasty, negative entities, as well.  This kind of thing drives me nuts.  \nRepeat after me, A&E: Ghosts are people, too!\n\n\nNellie\n\r\n--------------070900020905000802050905\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot; text=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;\n&lt;a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-abbreviated&quot; href=&quot;mailto:Marlboro63@...&quot;&gt;Marlboro63@...&lt;/a&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt;&gt; I would be very interested in\nseeing what A &amp; E has to say about&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Paranormal States.&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI&#39;m on a forum with the mother of one of the kids.&nbsp; She says that it is\nreal, but there are some issues on the production end.&nbsp; Basically any\nattempts at the technical side of investigation gets cut.&nbsp; The kids\naren&#39;t used to being on camera, so you do see a lot of retakes that\nseem rehearsed.&nbsp; She was also not thrilled that they chose to emphasize\nso much demonic stuff right off the bat.&nbsp; That was way out of balance.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt;&gt; I guess according to A &amp; E&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that if we are talking to the spirit of the dead then WE are the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; problem and should stop it or atleast that is how they addressed\nit.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Or is just how I see it?&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNo, I was also howling over that.&nbsp; So talking to dead people is bad,\neh?&nbsp; Maybe I should take their word for it that all dead people are\nnasty, negative entities, as well.&nbsp; This kind of thing drives me nuts.&nbsp;\nRepeat after me, A&amp;E: Ghosts are people, too!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNellie&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--------------070900020905000802050905--"}
