<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was looking at your photos section here wondering if you had any
further luck with modifying the new .470 board.I cannot quite make it
out, but there seems to be a row of screen print on the photo labeled
n_a.jpg on the board in the case above the speaker. I cannot make out
what the silkscreen labels read, and although there isn&#x27;t an interface
ribbon or connector, do you think this would be something that if you
could identify the mute circuit solderpad, could the traces on the
board be cut with a hobby knife on each side of the pad?

Probably a redundant question that had already occured to you, but I
couldnt read those labels so I thought I would ask anyway.

thanks
Andy</pre>
