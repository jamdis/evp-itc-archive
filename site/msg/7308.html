&gt; Cool Debbie, a bit like Sonia Rinaldi does especially if your using 
a duo phone line. You can record straight into the pc too if you hook 
it up right. I tested that out a few times and I had results. Nobody 
is up at 2am to test with me tho LOL so I set it aside. Still have 
all the hookups tho.
&gt;    
&gt;   And so very nice to offer it free!!! It&#x27;s nice to see some of us 
know the meaning of &quot;share&quot;.
&gt;    
&gt;   I&#x27;ll be gettin vacation soon so if ya need some help testing give 
me a holler.

&gt;           I&#x27;m testing out the &quot;MiniBox&quot; connected to telephones so 
that others 
&gt; that don&#x27;t have a &quot;Mini&quot; can record with me and try to connect with 
&gt; their loved ones in Heaven. I&#x27;ve been calling myself to practice 
&gt; (lol) .. It seems like it has potential and I&#x27;m working on clarity 
and 
&gt; longer messages. You can listen to my first recording in the file 
&gt; marked Debbie&#x27;s recordings/MiniBox/Messages via Telephone.
