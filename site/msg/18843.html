<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s the trouble with this, is like you said, alot of the conclusions people make are arbitrary, because not all the EVPs are crystal clear.  However, there are many EVPs that *are* crystal clear, and the good part about that is that EVERY additional one of these shoots the evidence up through the roof, because like you said, if it was &quot;just coincidence&quot; then the radio making sense with you should happen next to never...

&gt; so you have to have like an allowing going on.  I don&#x27;t know how many
&gt; hundreds of test videos and waves I&#x27;ve posted that I think are perfectly
&gt; clear and understandable and not one comment. People claim to listen but
&gt; vary rarely does anyone say they heard the same thing. It seems to be a
&gt; personal experience at best, with just enough so others are convinced there
&gt; is something to it.  Maybe I&#x27;m just Alice chasing the rabbit. Intriguing and
&gt; disappointing at the same time.
