There is\nanother c=\r\nompletely different category where no operator is touching the board or the=\r\n planchette,\nand yet it moves and remains in motion, often changing directi=\r\nons or flying off the board. This\ntype of activity is more akin to psychoki=\r\nnesis, the mind affecting the environment.\n\nBoth types of activity could be=\r\n mediated in the mind of a living operator, and in fact modern\nparapsycholo=\r\ngy research suggest this is the most reasonable explanation.
