There are several models available:\n&gt; some have built in IR lights, some have IR / UV lights, some are set-up for\n&gt; sky watching, and others are just plain ol&#39; full spectrum.\n&gt; \n&gt; With this camera (depending on the model, a regular one with the different\n&gt; options run around $120-150), you will also need the power supply ($12-$20),\n&gt; a tripod, and a portable recorder.  My group uses 2 of them and each one is\n&gt; attached to a portable DVD recorder that has a small LCD screen, you can\n&gt; find these refurbished for under $100.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tim\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun, Dec 12, 2010 at 3:51 PM, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; oh one more thing just because something say full spectrem does not mean it\n&gt; &gt; actually full spectrum the camera i have is the one that ghost\n&gt; &gt; adventures,ghost hunter,Bill murpghy etc have...this is the one to get!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On *Sun, 12/12/10, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Full Spectrum Cameras\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Sunday, December 12, 2010, 2:31 PM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   lol my husband surprised me with one to :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On *Sun, 12/12/10, draiga1 &lt;mail@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: draiga1 &lt;mail@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Full Spectrum Cameras\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Sunday, December 12, 2010, 12:11 PM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Everyone,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I want to get a full spectrum camera. My hubby is going to get me one for\n&gt; &gt; my Yule gift. I want a good one that captures apparitions. Does anyone here\n&gt; &gt; use one with success? Or know which one is a good one?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Draiga\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
