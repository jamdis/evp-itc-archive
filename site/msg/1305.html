By the way - Friedrich Jurgenson wrote in his book "Voice 
Transmissions With The Deceased" that he had a "spirit on the other 
side" named Lena who would assist him with tuning his radio to the 
proper frequency like you describe.

right tuning area. Recently Ive been trying the ST method first then 
continue on into the water method. For some reason the voices are 
very loud after the ST session ends and the radio is shut down. And 
a few say they prefer the water over the radio for speech. Others 
prefer the radio static. Not sure why exactly.
