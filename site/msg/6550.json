Then if you want people to get special notices you can add them as members by email or add as friends thru esnips. Make the folders/files public access and its open to the esnips community (theres quite a few over there) as well as the group forum here. You just say here you posted your files same as you always do and give the link and they can go and check them out even if its a 50 meg file. \n\n  It&#39;s pretty cool and it has alot of options. We use it to post ITC pictures and share big EVP collections or just keep up with some of the massive amount of results each other gets. \n   \n  Its better than alot of pay services Ive seen, and the fact that its free just makes it that much better. Alot of people are not computer saavy. But I simply email them the link, and when they click on it and visit my gallery or whatever I have set up for them to view, they automatically just verified thier email account is real. So then when they decide to join the signup is instant and they can begin the process of uploading immediately. It makes it so much easier for them to figure out how to do things.\n   \n  Your folder options are endless. You can make one for each box, and then make subfolders that are dated in each one. It allows descriptions or comments for each file.\n   \n  I used it to highlight different methods of recording and I didnt even come close to covering them all. This group has alot of methods going on, we just need more file space to share them. You will figure it out, just make a public folder, upload a couple files, and send us a link. It tells you what the link is for the folder and even allows you to change it if you wish.\n   \n  Misty\nbruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n          Misty,\nI opened an esnips account what do you do to get the files to the group?\n \nbruce\n\n\n  Bruce Halliday \n\n\n\n\n    \n---------------------------------\n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nFrom: bulletbabea@...\nDate: Wed, 30 Jan 2008 10:06:21 -0800\nSubject: RE: [EVP-ITC] Re: **Special Notice Regaurding Your Group Membership**\n\n        Thanks Bruce. My wish is that we had unlimited posting/filing space. But til then we will have to make do with what we have. Try the esnips thing out several of us are already over there forming our lil community for file sharing. With 50 gigs you can pretty much post in whatever format you like which is what we do.

One solution is to post Mp3 files instead of \nWav. files or any other format. It seems like the Mp3&#39;s sound the \nsame and are only 1/10th of the size. I think that would probably \nclear up 90 percent of the board right there. If i actually have more \nthan a couple files from here on out, i will be attaching them to an \ne-mail and not the board to save space here. And also, if people do \npost files maybe we can all just have one post that says we have \nuploaded files to our folder instead of 30 audio announcements in a \nrow that just seems to waste a lot of e-mail space in the individual \ne-mails. And it also pushes the current topic on the board to another \npage and is lost for those who wanted to share. Just my thoughts on \nhelping the subject. I know we are all excited, but misty is right. I \nwent to add a file the other day and the group was at 93 percent \ncapacity, so it won&#39;t be long before we run out of space.-Steve H.--- \nIn EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, &quot;Misty&quot; &lt;bulletbabea@ ...&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Just \na little friendly reminder that you all need to organize your &gt; files \nbetter in the files area.

But I have found a \nway around it. If just a few &gt; people signed up and shared using \nesnips they can invite others to &gt; visit thier files and once they do \nthey also get 50 gigs of free &gt; space for audio pictures or video or \nwhatever you want to post.&gt; &gt; I was considering setting up \none &quot;group&quot; account to start with and &gt; inviting all members who post \nfiles to join it and be able to post to &gt; the account. It will \nautomatically notify everyone thats a member &gt; when a file is added \nto it just like the yahoo group does. It also &gt; allows you to share \nwith the public or privately if you so choose. &gt; You can even allow \nyour friends to post to your account if you wish.&gt; &gt; This group has \ngrown and expanded and we just need to make a few &gt; changes to how we \ndo things to keep it running more smoothly for the &gt; future. I am \nhoping that you all will help me in this endeavor. I &gt; know many of \nyou have already adapted the idea to help us organize &gt; and maintain \nthe group.&gt; &gt; I want you to keep sharing and to be able to share \nmore! &gt; &gt; So please organize and not post stray files that are \ntargets for &gt; deletion once the que is 100% full.
