 Incase anyone is wondering, Rick lives about two blocks from me, that&#x27;s how
he rates a box.

 Yeah, it can be amazing at times. I had a box running random sweep mode
tonight, and as my daughter in-law pulled into the drive way &quot;Hi Dad&quot; came
out of the box, which is her usual greetting. Random seems to have some
merit, it wiol pick up thought, since we are all sprit that shouldn&#x27;t be
surprising.  but it&#x27;s a real pain to get it to work stable.

&gt; EVP and it&#x27;s clear I&#x27;ll take it under my wing for some sort of response,BUT
&gt; on the other hand We&#x27;re getting our names called and asnwers to &quot;Do You Know
&gt; Where You Are ?&quot; An d the response made us stop and wonder...reponse was &quot;In
&gt; the basement&quot;......HELLO we&#x27;re in the Basement......Also I believe it will
&gt; bring out the EVIL SIDE...which we did..and both my house as well as our
&gt; partners seems to have someone that has followed us,turning on lights in the
&gt; kitchen and opening the kitchen cabinets up,It made me feel sick all day and
&gt; affected our cat...not to mention simular things at our partners home...Be
&gt; careful what you say and ask for...cause you might get more than you
&gt; want.....Love Ya Frank....Rick
