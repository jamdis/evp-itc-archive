<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, Steve...I agree.  The top board is all that needs to be lifted.  
I became too aggressive and had the whole dang thing tore apart. I 
just lifted the board up and identified the 7th wire from the right 
matching up with the MU on the bottom board (needed a flashlight to 
see real good) and pushed my Xacto hobby knife through the wire.  By 
the way, if the SW button up top is not in properly when re-
assembling the radio, it can prevent the radio from functioning if it 
is stuck in the &quot;on&quot; position.  The button is not needed if you lose 
it down inside the radio.

&gt; I took the radio apart to take some pictures to show the hack and 
i&#x27;m 
&gt; not really sure why some had problems.  I think maybe some may have 
&gt; messed with the bottom board.  You only need to access the top 
board 
&gt; with the LCD display and there is nothing that will fall off except 
the 
&gt; 2 buttoms that control the light and SW band selector, both can 
easily 
&gt; be put on after the hack in a matter of seconds.  I posted some 
&gt; pictures and a detailed description on my site, so you can see the 
&gt; procedure.  It took 5 minutes the first time, but after looking at 
it 
&gt; again it could probably be done faster but take your time with it.
&gt; 
&gt; The details are at www.keyportparanormal.com and look for the 
folder on 
&gt; the left that says &quot;Simple Ghost Box Hack&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps.
