Science tries to find out what "works" (and why).=A0 Science would only rej=
ect something that didn't work.=A0 Science will accept evidence of a theory=
, but will also compare it to competing theories, and try to develop experi=
ments to determine which theory best supports the evidence.

So while creat=
ing a theory that an EVP is from a spirit is perfectly allowed in science, =
so is creating a theory that an EVP is just noise and being misinterpreted =
by the listener as words.=A0 Science would then continue to examine evidenc=
e, and test it against both theories, and give the most credence to the the=
ory that can best predict ongoing results.

I realize the purpose as stated=
 in this group's description, that you are "not really scientific".=A0 And =
when science tries to examine competing theories, sometimes it refers to th=
is as "debunking" one or the other (not all meanings of "debunk" are meant =
to be insulting or negative).=A0 So perhaps your frustration is that you ar=
e trying to occasionally challenge science, yet admitting you are not follo=
wing a scientific methodology.=A0 This would definately lead to friction be=
tween all involved (as another statement in the group description indiciate=
s: "If I detect attempts at debunking, I'll ban
immediately!")

So to remov=
e this frustration, I'd recommend either completely adopting the scientific=
 method here, and with your research, and stating that in the group (which =
would of course encourage testing and debunking), or completely distancing =
yourself from science, from claims about facts and proven methods, and just=
 keep to the part of the group definition that says "I just take the approa=
ch, try different methods, see what works (for you).".=A0 I feel that the w=
ay things are - being half in, half out, of a scientific approach - will ju=
st continue to cause accusations of negativity and ignorance, from one side=
 or the other.

Frank, I think you misunderstood or misread something somew=

" The method for this communication was *not* based on radio sweep, nor tra=

Sadly, radio sweep methods don't, and may not for=
