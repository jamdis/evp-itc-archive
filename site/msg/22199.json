I think some forget that you can argue theory and\nideas,  but not be personal or petty. We can be civil and friends the end\nof the day, we may agree to disagree about topics, but the proof is in the\ndata,isn&#39;t it? Frank is a really nice guy and I have always been treated\nwell by him, learned from him and respect his work. He has put in tireless\namounts of time and effort into his boxes and has always welcomed ideas and\ndiscussion on anything he has posted. Can we go back to the scope of this\ngroup and leave the drama at the door?\n\nPete Haviland\n\nI ha e been quie h ough alo o his, and I speak o F ank om ime o ime in p i a e emails.
