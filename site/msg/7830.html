<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>my daughter and i were making a video of us goofing around. this is a 
15 second video and we were laughing loudly. but towards the end of the 
15 seconds there we hear an unknown male voice saying &quot;say something&quot; 
we thought it was my brother&#x27;s voice maybe perhaps coming through my 
video but then it really didnt sound truly like my brother. sounded 
more like a male voice. now what the heck was that????????? this is the 
first time this has ever happened. we are still spooked about this.
