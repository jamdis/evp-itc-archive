Snowfire,
 
Thanks for making it louder=
 - I heard it this time and here  are my 
thoughts:  Sounds like a man's vo=
ice saying "we ain't dead", then  a woman's voice 
saying "that's a lie; ye=
ah we're dead".  Strangely the  woman's voice kind 
of sounded like your vo=
ice; it could be that whoever's  coming through is 
mimicking your voice (I=
've heard a similar mimicking effect  before in an EVP 
session conducted b=
y someone I know and trust).  The  other thought that 
crossed my mind is p=
erhaps you knowingly or unknowingly  spoke those words out 
loud and it was=
 picked up by your recorder's  microphone.  Please understand 
that I'm not=
 trying to be contrary and  that I'm just voicing my thoughts 
and could be=
 totally wrong since I do not  know you at all.
 
That being said, it's int=
eresting to me that after the  man said "we ain't 
dead," the woman replied=
 "that's a lie" (so  spirits, like humans, do lie); 
"yeah we're dead" (or =
perhaps the two  differ in their views on the state of 
being "dead").
 
No=
netheless this is all very interesting,  Snowfire; thank you for sharing.
