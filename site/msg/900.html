<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>music is as far away from white noise as you can get.


there are no voice fragments for entities to manipulate

voice voltage is being added to voltage of music which acts as 
carrier, via some inductor or nonlinear element near input.


audio transformer turned backwards connected to input with large 
speaker on8 ohm side and put at bottom of sound confining container 
like plastic garbage can  would eliminate hit-or-miss voltage 
superposition.


use a speaker for the microphone at bottom of wastebasket  hook to 
low side of audio transformer.  voices could be about 20 times louder


going to try it myself asap..speaker as microphone

&gt; I know they like to use music. In particular they can make use of 
certain instruments to propel thier voice across. So last night I 
played a short clip of Joe Satriani&#x27;s &quot;always with you always with 
me&quot; it contains music only, no vocals. I discovered that in the first 
few seconds of the clip the voices were able to sustain a loud, 
comprehensive line of communication until Satriani kicked it into 
high gear and the guitar notes were too loud and drowned everything 
out. Some could be heard on regular playback, most could be heard 
clearer at a slowed down rate of -74% &amp; -30%. I then did a session 
with no music. Both sessions lasted under 1 minute and both sessions 
had a yeild of about 18 clips/sentences. The difference being that 
more of the music clips were louder and clearer to understand for me 
and hopefully for you too. 
&gt;    
&gt;   Heres a few of the evp clips for you to download and evaluate. 
Many are very loud so I recommend you lower the sound DOWN... ALOT 
til you play it once to see what volume level it has. I use stereo 
speakers so I am used to blasting my head off LOL so careful you dont 
blow a speaker or your eardrums. Even I usually turn them down 
because the level of vibration and noise may be too much for my dogs 
ears. The process I used was the same, p1 filter only, amped at +15 
which works differently depending on what comes across and what I 
used for background sound. When using music the noise level is 
definitely alot higher and you will need to lower your sound for 
those LOL
&gt;    
&gt;   Only sharing some of the ones I think others can hear. The music 
session had alot more than the nonmusic session. I will send a short 
clip of satriani (the first part where the voices were the best) so 
that if anyone wants to give it a try they can.
