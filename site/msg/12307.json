I \nwas wondering though, if anyone has used this modded radio regularly \nand can give opinions on it&#39;s performance stacked up against a 12-469 -\n470 or 20-125. Looks like a more robust design, and that tuner knob \nlooks like a great candidate for manual tuning as well. Any thoughts?\n\nAndy"}
