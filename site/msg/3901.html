Hi, Bruce--
  Sorry I wasn't more explicit, because your voices deserve lots and lots of oohs and ahhs.  They are, yes, among the best out there.  It's very encouraging (and fascinating) to listen to them, as you seem to really have established real time give-and-take with the other side beyond what most have.
  From a newbie who's impressed by everything: your voices are amazing.
  Ursula

I posted 16 files two day's ago from the RSbox and only got 2 replies 
and both were from ann.

I posted a bunch of frank's box files today and not one response.

lets jump start this group with some new and positive energy everybody 
do some sessions and post the results, lets start the advance into the 
future.
