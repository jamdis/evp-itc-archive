OK Bruce, why is it that you, Steve and Frank seem to get all the popular people?  LOL, me and Joel are luck if we get the dead neighbor next door.  
   
  Great file but I don't hear the Ma There.  I think they might be saying Holiday, as in Billie Holiday.  I know she pasted from her life style and drugs at age 44.  
   
  In any event, pass some of those celebrities my way, I will take James Dean if Mike and Lisa can send him my way!! LOL
