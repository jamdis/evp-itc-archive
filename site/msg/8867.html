Ron,
 
There is no folder for you in the files section.
Maybe it got lost =
in the shuffle. Re post it so I can give a listen.
 
As far as the allophon=
es project being underwhelming, my opinion is just the opposite.
I have got=
ten very clear concise answers to direct questions and have had my name men=
tioned
numerous times. Cut the speed to 87% and uncheck x cross, you don't =
need it.
only cue should be checked.
 
When you do a session do not try to =
listen to all the sounds at the same time
Relax and try to let your ear pic=
k out just the relevant stuff, that's in real time.
 
When you are going ov=
er the recording keep only the words that are clear and apparent
and clip o=
ut the other random junk like the, err eeh aah eer sounds.
 
You will find =
that in the seconds preceding a question, once the crap is peeled away the =
answer or statement is there.
Plus Ron, you have had no signal where you ar=
e since you started and have never had a chance to let your ear and brain b=
ecome
a custom to listening to this type of communication. Give it some tim=
e, work with it and most of all, approach it
with a positive attitude and a=
 relaxed frame of mind. I'm sure that soon the communication will start to =
come stronger and
make more sense.

To Bruce, St=
efan and others using EVPM. 
I have posted a file of my test with EVPM alla=
phones under ronriko files.  I forward this for two reasons:  the first as =
a request from Bruce to determine recurring words and second because I want=
ed to have experienced ears hear my recording for comments.   Regarding the=
 test, this is just 30 secs or so of a 7 minute recording.  Recorded at 90%=
 using EVPmaker with xcross.  I was able to hear "art and arthor" a number =
of times within the 7 minutes.  This is after requesting no names be spoken=
.  
 
Regarding my experiences with evpmaker and the allaphone file sent by=
 Stefan, I must say my results have been underwhelming.  I hear nothing but=
 evp gibberish.  I ask that anyone with an ear for this to give a listen an=
d tell me if you hear anything intelligent.  I am in a terrible radio zone =
here in Mexico so I have high hopes on EVP maker and the file Stefan provid=
ed.  Also excited about the fact that so many others are getting excellent =
communications.  Thank you to anyone who takes the time to listen to and co=
nfirm my recordings.  I am beginning to feel like I am being blocked out li=
ke William had thought.  Maybe I am in a true dead zone, no pun intended, o=
r "they" don't want me in the loop for some reason.  Ron L
