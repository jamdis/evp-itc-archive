&gt; Last president? We don&#x27;t need no stinkin&#x27; president! Woohoo! Just kidding :)  As far as war with Iran or North Korea, I wouldn&#x27;t be in the least bit surprised if either one (or both) happened, our beloved fearmongering corporation-hugging leaders are big fans of money and violence, and you know the saying &quot;war is a racket&quot;....

&gt; &gt; The tech calling himself, David says we are going to be in another war  
&gt; &gt; soon, he says something about the next couple of months, with either North 
&gt; &gt; Korea  and/or Iran, he also says, this might be our last president for  
&gt; &gt; awhile....   :( sf

&gt; &gt; Thanks&#x27; Mostly I wondering if this is something that already happened, or  
&gt; &gt; if I heard it right.

&gt; &gt; Frank,
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; The two about the students, forward and in reverse, are both very  clear
