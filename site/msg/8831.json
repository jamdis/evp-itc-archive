Maybe they are \ndescribing a situation while alive and we just aren&#39;t understanding \ncorrectly.  The second i hear &quot;You forget the evil eye&quot;.  The last one \ni hear as you do.  Hey, this format beats hanging out the window to get \na signal from the shack hack and it&#39;s clearer too.  I think when we get \nfamiliar with the speech from this, it&#39;s going to be fantastic.  Others \nshould try this method as well, who live in a bad radio signal location.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kristin&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I just posted three MP3 files in my folder (Kristin&#39;s Folder)from a\n&gt; session I did today using EVP Maker and the Allophones.  Please listen\n&gt; to see if you hear as I do.  I find this way much tougher to hear\n&gt; live... so I hope I am doign better!  Please let me know. THX!\n&gt; \n&gt; k\n&gt; \n&gt; The first one actually coincides with Margaret&#39;s.. ARTHUR EMPLOYS AIR\n&gt; HOLES.\n&gt; \n&gt; The second ones says:  YOU ARE GETTING THE EVIL EYE\n&gt; \n&gt; Third one says:  YOU ARE VALUABLE\n&gt; \n&gt; Kristin\n&gt;"}
