Hi Margaret,
Sigh, unfortunately you were right in the beginning of what th=
is close minded young person says. LOL Oh well, spirit has a path for her a=
nd there's nothing we can do. She sent me a private email, bashing me for p=
osting her link she is obviously on this board and watches. Oh well, let it=
 roll, and she will learn someday.
Thanks for trying and sharing!!

[EVP-ITC] Re: skeptic: My response on Wiltshire Group site


Just checked t=
onight and OF COURSE my comments were not approved and do not appear 
on th=
e page. Apparently, only those posts in SUPPORT of her nonsense are being a=
llowed. 
Imagine my surprise!! ;-) 

Thus, reinforcement for me to stick wi=
th my original position in the future, of not wasting 
time and energy on t=
hose who are not open to persuasive arguments when they aren't in 
favor of=
 their close-minded position. 

LOL - Maybe I need a little reminder sticke=
r on my computer: JUST SAY NO TO CYNICS!
