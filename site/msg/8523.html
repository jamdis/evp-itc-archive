<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Mike.  At the end, after you ask who the lady is that said your name, I hear two 
&#x27;typically&#x27; male names.  &quot;Humphrey&quot; followed by &quot;Howie.&quot;  I thought maybe somewhere in 
the middle I hear the name &quot;Karen.&quot;  This would be right after the male voice says what 
sounds to me like, &quot;Yo/Joe, what&#x27;s up?&quot;
