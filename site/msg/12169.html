&gt;  I just purchased both of them. As They have not arrived and will not
&gt; arrive until at least OCT 4th (Bill is backed up with orders.) I can&#x27;t
&gt; comment on how well either of them work yet. I will as soon as they
&gt; get here. I say hey try them out... if they don&#x27;t work for you
&gt; somebody will buy them off ebay. It would beat having to wait for
&gt; months till Bill can get some more made.

There are  both good instruments to have. The Puck with a Box running
is a nice experiment to conduct to see how much they correlate to each
other. The Ovilus can also work as a real time communication device
which is great. I&#x27;ve just started putting them to work and I&#x27;m quite
pleased. -Bill M</pre>
