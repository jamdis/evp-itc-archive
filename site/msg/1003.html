<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>a tesla &quot;coil&quot; is a radiofrequency step-up transformer in which the 
primary and secondary are each tuned to the same frequency.

the above dictates that primary be high C  low L and the secondary be 
highL and lowC

the primary and secondary dont need to be co wound; they can be 
several feet apart---thats how tesla invented radio; he just kept 
moving the primary and secondary farther and farther apart.

it is intrinsic to a high C tank circuit that it is easily shock 
excited and will resonate on harmonics.  a high L circuit is the 
reverse.


the high L tries to &quot;re-sinerize&quot; the carrier and construct the 
modulation from noise provided by primary.

receiver should be near or connected to secondary and tuned to same 
frequency.

BOTTOM LINE:

amplifier, handheld radio etc must be operated on the lowest voltage 
which it will function on; 4 volts not nine volts.  thats behind the 
ubiquitous  observation &quot;i just started getting voices when batt 
died.  with new batt, no voices.  spirits must be angry or something.&quot;

without voltage starvation in receiver/amplifier you mainly amplify 
the noise and not the desired residue of subquantic voice bolstered 
by cohered noise.</pre>
