<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>To me this was wholly unintelligible.  I&#x27;m sorry, I could not make out a single word.  It does sound like something was trying to communicate, but had yet to master the method in which to do so.  

Also, was that rain in the background?  If it was, was there lightning?  Lightning makes communication next to impossible because you get bursts of static noise.
