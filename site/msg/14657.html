&gt;  Well, if this leads to fighting, I&#x27;m sure Spirit will stop talking to us
&gt; altogether, I tried to call Bill&#x27;s machine, but I couldn&#x27;t hear much of
&gt; anything, maybe sound was too low, or maybe someone was hearing what I
&gt; should have been hearing, I&#x27;m sure they heard me, but someone on the other
&gt; end was reaping the rewards of my one sided conversation, I&#x27;m sure.  Left me
&gt; very unhappy, (p...is..ed o..f). , I sure wish people could make this work
&gt; for all of us though, and give credit where credit is due, Edison told me,
&gt; he was working with a certain couple of people, poor guy, he&#x27;s running all
&gt; over the place, when people keep asking for his help, he has to stop what
&gt; he&#x27;s doing to inspire one person, then has to run over to see what all the
&gt; hollering is all about with someone else.  Don&#x27;t forget, none of this would
&gt; be possible were it not given to us by the Man upstairs, and no one gives
&gt; Him any credit, it&#x27;s not &quot;religion.&quot;  It&#x27;s called life.

&gt;&gt;   Yeah, I think a lot of pretenders do try to find ways to promote
&gt;&gt; themselves into more credibility.  In fact, I wonder about that project you
&gt;&gt; are going to be doing with Mr Moon.  It&#x27;s my guess he is the one who
&gt;&gt; suggested it (maybe even dropped some profitability hints?).  Realize, his
&gt;&gt; method of performing medium with the box, and charging the vulnerable large
&gt;&gt; amounts of money, is under attack from many quarters, and he has begun to go
&gt;&gt; on the defensive.  One thing that is hard for him to defend, is how he can
&gt;&gt; be so expert with the box when he had nothing to do with its construction.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Now consider, if he can get the box&#x27;s maker to participate in a project
&gt;&gt; together, even just once, he can add to his list of credentials things such
&gt;&gt; as &quot;Worked together with the original box&#x27;s designer, Frank Sumption, on new
&gt;&gt; designs.&quot; Or even &quot;Co-creater of the new Box&quot;, whatever it is.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You will be giving him that very credibility, that those &quot;do my shows&quot; are
&gt;&gt; looking for.  Maybe even getting him new customers.  Just by associating
&gt;&gt; with him on one project.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My advice is, be careful that you aren&#x27;t just being used for your
&gt;&gt; credentials Frank.

&gt;&gt;    Yeah, real interesting, if ya know something about these various
&gt;&gt; &quot;players&quot; in the field. Yet they wonder why I don&#x27;t play those &quot;do my show&quot;
&gt;&gt; games. A certain amount here left unsaid, so not too many will get it.
