Most of us do not have "all the equipment"  
we are using RS radio's, most people don't have a "Frank's Box," so we have 
 no other choice anyway. 
"Point is you have plenty of questions to ask the human's who have built 
the  equipment you are using before you can even begin to ask questions of the 
 entities you are communicating with."

Assumptions and expectations!Assumptions and expectations!<WBR>? I hear a 
lot of both of these concepts  in your words and when mentioning your 
research. Cognitive functioning or  processing sensory information in order to come 
to a conclusion or judgement  is how we function in this world. In order 
for your mind to understand this  physical world you live in it automatically 
makes certain assumptions about  sensory information it takes in. Your eyes 
expect to see objects oriented  correctly, with the correct color, lighting, 
reflectivity and shading, and you  expect there size and shape to be within 
scale compared to other objects. My  point is your senses have a range, 
which implies limitations. Since this is  correct for your senses it is also 
correct for your ability to understand  perspectives with any wide ranging 
diversity. You are able to see and process  the information of our physical 
world just as any other human being does. That  is great for a human but why 
would you think for a second, you co of a mind and  voice that speaks through  
a radio from some unknown location. 
The information you receive from the other side of your radios or even from 
 thin air through EVP's could be completely correct and true no matter what 
the  context because you don't know what perspective it is coming from. You 
are  making a lot of unfounded assumptions about the (dare I say) beings or 
worlds  they exist in and have a lot of expectations about the information 
you  receive. You are looking for answers to the wrong questions! Quit 
assuming  that these entities know you or the people around you. Quit assuming 
they are  here for your entertainment as a personal fortune teller. Quit 
expecting them  to know answers to question they may have themselves (just 
because they aren't  physical doesn't mean they know everything). Don't assume you 
will be speaking  to a dead relative or someone you once knew. Go to a 
fortune teller if you  want information about the furture. If you are serious 
about researching these  voices and the equipment used to record them then ask 
the right questions.  
If you have a box made by Frank then ask Frank how the different circuits  
work, what is the puropose of some of the options, why is the RVG better or  
worse than a circuit without it? You have a unique situation here where the 
 inventor of an important piece of equipment is willing to share the most  
minute details of how it works without a price tag attached. Some of the 
other  box variations are sold by one person but created by someone else and 
usually  based on some loose design similar to Frank's. The other equipment 
made by  Bill Chapp and others will probably stay a mystery because they are 
sold for  profit. Most people who use the different "hacks" know how to make 
them but  don't know much about electronic theory or the behavior of radio 
waves to  understand how they work. 
Point is you have plenty of questions to ask the human's who have built the 
 equipment you are using before you can even begin to ask questions of the  
entities you are communicating with. 
Regards, 
Frank R.
