I don't see them "completely ignoring all the users out there do hear this =
stuff".=C2=A0 The fact that they did the study says in itself that they do =
recognize "all the users out there do hear this stuff".=C2=A0 Those claims =
are WHY they seem to have done the study.

And to do they study, they need =
a controlled environment, not just one where they grab=C2=A0 random anecdot=
es from "all the users out there do hear this stuff".

So I still look forw=
ard to the entire study.=C2=A0 Why not post it, so we can judge for ourselv=
es what they got right and what they got wrong?
