I never use protection...and have had a problem with a spirit that came
home with us from Waverly.  He&#x27;s gone now, with the help of a great
individual.  I have evp&#x27;s of this entity saying horrible things.  I think
I may start using protection now...

&gt; As someone who has never used a protection ritual (even though I consider
&gt; myself a very spiritual person), I&#x27;m not sure I understand what the ritual
&gt; is intended to protect the person invoking it from.  I&#x27;m not being a smart
&gt; ass; I&#x27;m simply trying to learn.  Can we be hurt physically or psychically
&gt; by certain spirits, or can our experimentation open a dark portal that&#x27;s
&gt; not meant to be opened?  My instinct has always been that if I don&#x27;t
&gt; acknowledge evil it can have no power over me, but perhaps that&#x27;s
&gt; ignorant.  I once invited spirits into my house from outside and
&gt; immediately recorded a negative EVP while heating a cup of coffee in the
&gt; microwave.  I was too ecstatic to be frightened by the message, but since
&gt; then I&#x27;ve wondered what kind of spirit would want to say such a thing to
&gt; me and if I should be more cautious in the future.  I would love some
&gt; feedback on this recording.

&gt;   Bad idea! In my opinion. You just create fear with that crap, and
&gt;   fear feeds itself. Once again, you will create what you expect to
&gt;   get. If you use protection BS, you&#x27;ll have convinced yourself that
&gt;   there is something to be affraid of, and so you will tend to creat a
&gt;   thoughtform to fulfill that expectation.

&gt;   &gt; everyone,
&gt;   &gt;
&gt;   &gt; I have written up the short protection ritual I use before every
&gt;   &gt; session, I have been using it for quite a while now and have had no
&gt;   &gt; problems with dark heads other than the occasional curse word.
&gt;   &gt;
&gt;   &gt; I recommend that all researchers experienced and new use this or a
&gt;   &gt; similar protection ritual before every box session if you are not
&gt;   &gt; already.
&gt;   &gt;
&gt;   &gt; hey it&#x27;s better to have it and not need it , than need it and not
&gt;   have
&gt;   &gt; it!
&gt;   &gt;
&gt;   &gt; I will post it in the files section in a folder marked
&gt;   &gt; &quot;protection ritual&quot;
&gt;   &gt;
&gt;   &gt; Thanks guy&#x27;s
&gt;   &gt;
