<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for the info, Bruce.  I guess because I use such a wide variety of digital recorders, 
techniques, software, and settings, what I&#x27;m looking for is a way to catalog the session 
clips along with the details.  This is not counting the MiniBox, 12-469, 12-470, either of 
my manual sweep radios, or EVP Maker.  So, like yourself, I too have much more than &quot;one 
box&quot; to keep track of.   I also have a variety of cameras/settings used for ITC images.  LOL 
- I&#x27;m in definite need of something &quot;fancy.&quot;  ;0)

If I can recall what the file is named, I can use the &quot;spotlight&quot; feature on my MAC to find it, 
though often the content of  a single file is much longer than I could possible name it.  For 
example, my recent results with EVP Maker/SpeakJet Allophones.  I do jot some things 
down in a Mead notebook, but even that can be a chore to go through when I&#x27;m wanting to 
find information that is older.

For example, without electronic organization, I can pull up a file and recall that I used 
Diamond Cut Live6/Forensics software, but if I can&#x27;t refer to some kind of notes, there is 
no way I can recall what the specific settings were unless the session was recent and still 
fresh in my mind (and/or the notes easily found.)

What I&#x27;m wanting is some kind of simple database.  It&#x27;s looking more and more like I&#x27;m just 
going to have to buy the software and create it.  If I do, I&#x27;ll be sure to share the template 
with others who might also be interested.

&gt; hi Margaret,
&gt;  
&gt; I just use a folder dedicated to the individual session 
&gt; whatever files I get go in, numbered in the order I got them from the recording.
&gt;  
&gt; The main recording file gets named with the box used, date and session # if you use 
one.
&gt;  
&gt; these individual session folders are placed into a main folder, or you could create sub 
folders for each
&gt; month and place those in a main folder.
&gt;  
&gt; I don&#x27;t think you need anything fancy, especially since you are only using one box.
&gt; I use 5 different boxes and now EVPM so for me it could really get confusing.
&gt;  
&gt; for you the simpler the better. If it&#x27;s something like this
&gt;  
&gt; Main folder: box files/2008
&gt;  
&gt; sub folders1: jan., feb., mar. so forth.
&gt;  
&gt; sub folders2: 469_session5_3-31-08
&gt; All files including main go into sub folders2
&gt; in turn that folder goes into the appropriate sub folder1
&gt; when the month is over that sub folder goes into the folder for the year.
&gt;  
&gt; Say you wanted to reference a file from 3-31-08, you would know exactly were to find 
it.
&gt;  
&gt; that&#x27;s how I do it and it seems to work.

&gt; Do you have any kind of database of your clips, Steve? I have many good examples but 
no organization (other than keeping the clips from a session, or a day, grouped together 
in the same folder). It&#x27;s hard for me to keep track of everything. Eons ago, I used to create 
simple databases with Filemaker Pro. I&#x27;ve been thinking lately, I need to come up with 
something to use as references for the details for various clips. I&#x27;d be interested in 
knowing what, if anything, others are using. Margaret --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, 
&quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Yeah, i only post the files if they have a certain 
meaning or are &gt; really clear for others to listen. I probably average about 15 files &gt; in a 5 
minute session, but will only post maybe 3 or 4. If you do &gt; enough sessions, the good 
files with start to add up.&gt; &gt; -Steve H.&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com,
