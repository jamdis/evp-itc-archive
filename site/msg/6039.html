&gt; hehehe I believe it! I saw a show once with talking dogs, they said 
a variety of things, one of them was even on a tv commercial saying I 
love you
&gt;    
&gt;   They have vocal ability, they learn english, they have brains... 
so why not
&gt;    
&gt;   Lauras dog started barking during one of her ITC sessions and 
some evp voices came out in that bark when we played it back. I said 
look your dogs talkin LOL
&gt;    
&gt;   Our male chihuahua tries to vocalize, he tries to copy whatever 
you are saying as long as you start with OOO OOO OOO hehehehe then 
whatever comes after he will try to copy. He finally gives up and 
just starts barking loud all excited.
&gt;    
&gt;   I know Brian Jones has some interest in what animals say, last I 
heard he was planning on researching into that more dunno if he stuck 
with it.

&gt;           I have gotten our dead dogs on EVP, or through the box, 
but today, as 
&gt; my wife an I were both downstairs, we didn&#x27;t hear the doorbell as 
the 
&gt; neighbor kid was ringing it, so being about 7, he just came on in. 
The 
&gt; smallest Yorkie let out a loud bark, and I swear it said &quot;get outta 
&gt; here&quot;. I heard it as plan as any other speech. 
&gt; 
&gt; I know, anecdotal evidence.
