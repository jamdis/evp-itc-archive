Your f=\r\navorite charity, in an R&D account, grandchildren&#39;s college fund or whateve=\r\nr righteous cause you want. \n\nJust an idea! Even if you don&#39;t want to get r=\r\nich and I understand that, you better want to keep control of it. Governmen=\r\nt also has ways of making innovative new concepts disappear.

Knowing RoseMary Ellen personally, I can tell=\r\n you that\n\n&gt;she has devoted much of her life to the paranormal and through =\r\nher\n\n&gt;writings and teachings have been able to convey messages in many\n\n&gt;wa=\r\nys and her intentions are sincere.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;I do have a theory on this, and is =\r\nonly my opinion.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;I have watched and observed the box on many occassion=\r\ns.
