I ho=\r\npe, when Windbridge concludes their study, that it will \n        support th=\r\ne notion that there is apparent communication formed in ways \n        that =\r\ncannot be explained by currently known and understood laws of \n        natu=\r\nre. THAT alone, in my opinion, would be a big plus for all ITC \n        com=\r\nmunities, regardless of the method from which that communication was \n     =\r\n   received. What&#39;s the old saying? &quot;It takes but one white crow to prove \n=\r\n        all crows are not black.&quot; Any proof, derived from any EVP method, w=\r\nould \n        be greatly welcomed as far as I&#39;m concerned.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Margaret =\r\n\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A title=3Dmailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n   =\r\n     href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; \n        target=3D_blank&gt;EVP=\r\n-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;, Frank Sumption \n        &lt;purplealiengirl@=\r\n&lt;WBR&gt;...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It&#39;s the same \n        old stuff, every=\r\none wants to completely ignore absolutely all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n        work that ha=\r\ns been in this field since the caveman and act like they \n        just&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; discovered spirit and EVP.
