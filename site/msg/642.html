<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was trying to do a quick search on line, but couldn&#x27;t find it. I have some 
infromation at home I can put up. I have an article from a 1995 Popular 
Electronics on EVP that explains the diode method. Welcome to the group BTW.

The Spiricom is kinda complicated, and I&#x27;ve heard that no one has been able 
to get it to work. I do have another method where I randomly tune a radio, 
and use the resulting random audio as a source of raw audio which the 
spirits can use to form their voices. It kinda complicated, but I have 
schematics on line at http://franksumption.tripod.com on the system 
information page. You almost have to have a scope to be able to get it to 
work though, curiously, no one seems to be able to get my circuits to work 
either, altough others can use the &quot;boxes&quot;.

There are some methods that require very little equipment, one is EVPmaker, 
that runs on a computer, and is freeware.

Another is using a foreign lanuge form shortwave, and just announce you&#x27;re 
doing an EVP recording, and rtecord the shortwave station open air, wiht the 
recorder set up near the radio. On playback there should be phrases, and 
messages in English.

&gt;
&gt;Glad i somehow found this forum, was pointed here by some people who i
&gt;believe know what they are talking about.  Anyhow i recently bought a
&gt;germanium diode and also a tape recorder.  Is anyone familiar with how
&gt;to setup the diode with my tape recorder to help &quot;enhance&quot; my chances
&gt;of recieving a EVP recording?  I was hard to get these dang diodes, but
&gt;now i dont know what to do with them.  I have a sodder gun and some
&gt;wire, but no clue what to do with any of these parts yet.  Also I had
&gt;some questions about the SpirtComm device and if anyone here is
&gt;familiar with how to construct one (i would like to and already have
&gt;the rough diagram available online).
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Ryan
