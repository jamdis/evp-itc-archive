<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>While waitng for glue and varnish to dry on the box I was working, went to
Good Will and found this tuner, a Toyota with not tape deck or CD player.
The thing wouldn&#x27;t turn on so I could get he pin out form measuring
voltages, but I had the pin out for the AM tuner in my notes from 2006, so
that is waht&#x27;s use here. I wanted to make the smallest possible dual supply
random sweep box that I could. Dual supply cuz random doens&#x27;t work so great
on sinlge supply and single supply requires more parts, even for linear
sweep.

 I tuned the radio between statiosn cuz this tuner is sensitive enough to
get distant AM stations even in my garage. You can use AM skip as the raw
audio. On the first one at 2 seconds &quot;we&#x27;re talklin&#x27; to Frank&quot;, at 4 seconds
&quot; I saw Frankie(my son) with you&quot; and at the end &quot;Frank Believe&quot;. In the
second on at 3 seconds &quot;f--you purple&quot;, and at 13 seconds &quot;we&#x27;ve go to end
with Bruce&quot;.
