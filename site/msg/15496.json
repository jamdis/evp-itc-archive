I \nwas  once listening to yahoo chat where someone was giving their idea of \nScripture,  and the religion they belonged to, which had certain beliefs, that \nI did not  agree with, I feel asleep, and I heard a very distinct voice come \ninto my right  ear saying, &quot;Bonnie, I will teach you the Bible&quot; guess that \nperson didn&#39;t want  me to listen to that person anymore thought I&#39;d be led \nastray or  something.   But, little do they realize my conviction is so \nstrong,  it will never brake down, sure I get upset sometimes when things don&#39;t \nalways go  my way, but nothing can take what I know away that is, what I know \nto be  true.  It&#39;s all a matter of perception, that is so, but in one way \nor  another we are all shown at some point, that there really is a &quot;Prime \nMover,&quot;  and there really is no death, it&#39;s only becoming unwired from our \nphysical body,  and going home.

They were asking for you, this was a few \ndays \n&gt;  &gt; ago, over my radio the RS 20-125 they sound very clear to me, didn&#39;t \nsay  \n&gt; &gt; what they wanted maybe I can go through the recording, and see  what \nelse \n&gt; they \n&gt; &gt; are saying. They like to watch baseball  sometimes on my big screen, \nhad \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; whole group of them  here last weekend, for fun I asked them where they \n&gt; were \n&gt; &gt;  in the house, they said &quot;all around&quot; and &quot;4 are sitting on the floor,&quot; \nI  \n&gt; &gt; said, well I must walk right through you people then, they said  &quot;yes&quot; \nI \n&gt; &gt; asked them if they felt any sensation, they said they do  feel when we \n&gt; walk \n&gt; &gt; through them. I always ask them if  they want football or baseball, \nthey \n&gt; say \n&gt; &gt; &quot;baseball&quot; I  had one spirit fella here routing for Seattle, it was the \n&gt; &gt; Tigers  _Mariners game, since I&#39;m not much into sports, I wasn&#39;t really \n&gt; sure  if \n&gt; &gt; it was a rerun or not, but they seemed to be happy, when I  went into \nmy \n&gt; &gt; room to work, I could hear them in the front room  chatting amongst \n&gt; &gt; themselves. Sometimes it&#39;s neat to have company  out here, and I don&#39;t \n&gt; even have to \n&gt; &gt; feed them. Would you  know anything about who the fella is in the \nsecond \n&gt; &gt; one?
