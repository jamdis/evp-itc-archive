  "...
  A novel magic flame, more sensitive to sounds than our own ears, forms one of the most amusing experiments the home chemist can perform.
  A gallon or half-gallon bottle serves nicely for this experiment. Fit it with a cork supplied with two short glass tubes and connect the gas supply to one and a rubber hose fitted with the glass portion of a medicine dropper to the other. After waiting for the air to be driven out of the system light the gas at the tip of the medicine dropper. With the gas turned on full, the flame will roar.
  Then place a suitable pinch clamp over the rubber tube leading to the inlet of the bottle and throttle the gas gradually until the flame burns less violently and ceases to roar. In this condition the flame will be sensitive to the faintest vibrations.
  Every noise will cause the flame to duck. Even the slight scratching noise made when striking a match will cause the sensitive flame to dart. By experimenting you will find that high-pitched sounds cause the flame to shorten or dodge more than low notes. A flame of this type is so sensitive that it responds to vibrations so rapid (high-pitched) that they cannot be heard by the human ear.
