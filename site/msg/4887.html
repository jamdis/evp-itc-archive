<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Bruce, I will try the 469 next week if I don&#x27;t get my hands on  
the older model. I was wondering if I&#x27;d get used to the clicking, we  
humans are so good at adapting. Good idea also with talking with the  
local RS manager. I&#x27;m also going to be in Florida this weekend and  
will scope out the RS stores between Orlando and St Augustine.

&gt; The new model 469&#x27;s have the inherent clicking after using it for a
&gt; while you will learn to ignore it. Juli Velazquez has both 469 and
&gt; old model 470 and she prefers the 469 and gets very good results with
&gt; it.
&gt;
&gt; My suggestion is make your local radio shack manager aware that you
&gt; are searching for these particular radios and can he please try to
&gt; locate one for you. I&#x27;m sure that there is one or two sitting on a
&gt; shelf in some radio shack somewhere.
&gt;
&gt; If you can get an older model 469 that does not have the clicking, It
&gt; looks exactly like the older model 470 and comes in the cardboard box
&gt; nox the plastic see through rapper.
&gt;
&gt; hang in there something will turn up. And if not don&#x27;t let that
&gt; discourage you from your research just do your best and what you have
&gt; will work for you.
