Many departments customize the 10 codes for their department, so from location to location the codes don&#39;t always mean the same thing.  When multiple departments are working together Home Land Security recommends that to eliminate possible misunderstandings, 10 codes should not be used.\n\n \nRegards,\nJon in Texas\n \n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: Rj &lt;rasterer@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Monday, May 11, 2009 8:08:33 AM\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] The Seven - interesting tidbit of info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode 7 is either code for being out of service (short for 10-7), or a meal break:\n\nhttp://www.radiolab s.com/police- codes.html\nhttp://www.yougetin fo.com/info/ PolCodes. html\n\n\n--- On Sun, 5/10/09, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt;\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] The Seven - interesting tidbit of info\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\nDate: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 9:31 PM\n\n\nTonight at work I was talking to a state trooper, there had been an accident. I asked him if there were any deaths (it was very very bad) and he said he didnt know so he got on his radio and called in and asked them if it was a 7 at the site. They told him negative, and he told me the little boy who was the worst off was still alive. I asked him why did you ask them if it was a 7. He said code 7, I was asking them if they were dead. So if you ever hear anyone call 7 over the radio that means someones dead.\n \nJust thought I would pass that on. I find it interesting since I know alot of us have heard this before when used to describe who is speaking rather than a name they say seven.\n \nMisty \n \n\n   \n\n\n      \r\n--0-1852773465-1242098277=:9909\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;There are general set of 10 codes that recommended and published for people listing to emergency services radio bands as a go by.&nbsp; Many departments customize the 10 codes for their department, so from location to location the codes don&#39;t always mean the same thing.&nbsp; When multiple departments are working together Home Land Security recommends that to eliminate possible misunderstandings, 10 codes should not be used.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;br&gt;Jon in Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; padding-left: 5px; font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;&lt;hr size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span\n style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Rj &lt;rasterer@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Monday, May 11, 2009 8:08:33 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [EVP-ITC] The Seven - interesting tidbit of info&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; -x-system-font: none;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;Code 7 is either code for being out of service (short for 10-7), or a meal break:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.radiolab&quot;&gt;http://www.radiolab&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://s.com/police-&quot;&gt;s.com/police-&lt;/a&gt; codes.html&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.yougetin&quot;&gt;http://www.yougetin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://fo.com/info/&quot;&gt;fo.com/info/&lt;/a&gt; PolCodes. html&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Sun, 5/10/09, Misty Dawn &lt;i&gt;&lt;bulletbabea@ &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://yahoo.com&quot;&gt;yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@\n yahoo.com&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] The Seven - interesting tidbit of info&lt;br&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;br&gt;Date: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 9:31 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;yiv1134304038&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-size-adjust: inherit;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tonight at work I was talking to a state trooper, there had been an accident.
