I do feel though that the ones that get emotionally  \n&gt;&gt; moved\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the most are the ones wanting with all their heart to hear from a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; loved one. When these people get an answer that may or may not be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; heard by all, they feel that it is indeed from a loved one and it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; hits them in the heart as if it was real.
