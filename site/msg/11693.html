How do you have the 469 set up?

YES. Actually, getting the flash as far away from the lens as possible
plus either bouncing it off the ceiling or using a diffuser will
almost eliminate dust orbs. A speedlite flash is well worth the $$. 

To make this a little more on topic, I have a 469 radio shack hack
unit. I've tried it a few times and haven't received any messages at
all yet. I've even tried just letting it run for a while while I'm
doing other things and haven't gotten anything. I guess there isn't
anyone around who wants to talk to me :( Do you know of anything I can
do to try to drum up some conversation?
