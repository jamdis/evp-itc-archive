To give any individual that wants \nto an\n&gt; opportunity to use it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; You will find many forms of interaction on this group, running the \ngamut from total agreement \n&gt; to calm debate /discussion. To full blown arguments. \n&gt;  \n&gt; That is what makes a group, If everyone followed one single \nideology and the ideas of any single person without question\n&gt; it would not be a group it would be a cult.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Welcome to the wonderful world of box research robin, I&#39;m sure you \nwill be a valued member and researcher in this community.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: MudPuddleFarm@...: Thu, 17 Jan 2008 22:38:57 -\n0800Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debate--Bruce\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m still giving this topic a lot of thought because I absolutely \nbelieve in the power of prayer, the power of positivity, and the \npower of ritual.  When I first started recording EVP a couple of \nyears ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when it \nhappened to me I felt elated rather than frightened or distressed.  I \nwill ask again:  What physical or psychic harm is a disembodied \nentity capable of doing?  Please listen to the one EVP I&#39;ve posted on \nthis board and tell me what, if anything, you hear.  I know what I \nhear, and I consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is the \nresponse that has created the determination in me to continue \nresearching the unknown.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings.  I only want to learn as \nmuch as I can from you and the other dedicated researchers on this \nboard.  It never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in the \npast, and that&#39;s about all I can say.  I will probably use one from \nthis point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract \ngoodness.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; So, thank you for this contribution.  I think the debate has been \nan excellent one, and I&#39;ve appreciated the opportunity to be \nenlightened.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Robin\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----  \n&gt; From: bhali333 \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 16, 2008 8:06 AM\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debate\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I swore I would not get wraped up in this debateBUT!The reason I \ncame up with this whole protection ritual was that some of the new \nresearchers whereexpressing a rational concern for negative responces \nthat they were recieving through thier boxes.The short protection \nritual that I posted is not meant to quell irrational histerical \nfear, and I agreewith rosemary that anyone suffering from such fear \nshould rethink thier involment in the paranormal research field.that \nbeing said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal comfort to \nthose new individuals that had never expperienced spiritual \nnegativity. And to help ease them into aproaching a session \neventually with confidenceand determination as well as full \ncuriousity for all types of the communication we recieve.My initial \npost of the ritual file was done with the best of intentions and \nmeant to be another tool available for those who felt they needed or \nwanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer ritual, I don&#39;t \nthink it is really worthy of all this debate.Use it, don&#39;t use it. \nIt&#39;s there if you want it. Also I must say there are two kinds of \nfear the kind that is natural and a god given emotion for self \npreservation, ie the fright and flight reflex that is an instinctive \ntrait in all of us. Then you have the irrational dibilitating phobic \nfear that can turn an individual into a frozen statue. That type of \nfear I believe is unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt with and \nlearned how to harness. I also believe that anyone that harbors that \ntype of fear would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a \ncase of such fear it would already be present and doing a small \nprotection ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take it for \nwhat it is, something to utilize in our box of tools like an emf \nmeter.you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the bottom of \nyour tool box at home that you inherited from your grandfather and \nhave never usedbut if you come across that odd nut that needs \ntightening somedsy you will be glad you have it.Bruce\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Need to know the score, the latest news, or you need your Hotmail-\nget your &quot;fix&quot;.\n&gt; http://www.msnmobilefix.com/Default.aspx\n&gt;"}
