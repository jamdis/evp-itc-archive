<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Was this made specifically for EVP? Looking at the site, it looks  
commercial.  How does it work for EVP? I&#x27;m very interested, but I  
know nothing about this type of program at all. How do you make it  
work for you to record EVP?

&gt; Hi,it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve logged on here but just popping in to
&gt; say hi gang! Glad that y&#x27;all are here!
&gt;
&gt; I saw some information in another ITC forum about DC Six, an audio
&gt; editor that allows one to record EVP in Real Time... and it&#x27;s
&gt; awesome! Has anyone here tried out the demo version of this program
&gt; that&#x27;s now been updated to DC Seven?
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with it and it&#x27;s really amazing. I
&gt; can talk into it and some of my EVP contacts answer back right away.
&gt; But because I am not knowledgeable about sound recorders except for
&gt; the basics when it comes to editing my EVP, I would like to know if
&gt; someone here could download the 10 day trial version of DC Seven and
&gt; let me know what you think about it. I&#x27;m having a few problems with
&gt; getting it to work as it&#x27;s probably supposed to work... mainly having
&gt; a problem with feedback and so on..
&gt; Here&#x27;s the link to DC Seven&#x27;s 10 trial demo:
&gt; http://www.enhancedaudio.com/dc_seven.htm
&gt; Hope someone here will try it out because I would love to know if it
&gt; works for you!
