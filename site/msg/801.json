I would like to hear what he \n&gt;has to say\n&gt;\n&gt;Staten Island Paranormal &lt;SIParanormalSociety@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           Chris actually said that he was told that only 30 people in our\n&gt;country could use the box. I agree with what you are saying. That\n&gt;makes sense. I&#39;m just relating what we were told on Saturday by\n&gt;Chris Moon.\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, LON3_S7AR &lt;lon3_s7ar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i think that hes talking about, like EVP, where some people\n&gt;automatically get messages and others NEVER get em.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Staten Island Paranormal &lt;SIParanormalSociety@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;That would be awesome, but Chris said not everyone would be able to\n&gt;use\n&gt; &gt; them? Is that true, Frank, that only certain people were supposed\n&gt;to\n&gt; &gt; be able to use the boxes?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Amy\n&gt; &gt; SIParanormal\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, LON3_S7AR &lt;lon3_s7ar@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you know frank, maybe making these boxes will be your FT calling.\n&gt;I\n&gt; &gt; bet that if you started looking for partners and financial backing\n&gt;that\n&gt; &gt; people would come out of the woodwork to back you. Putting these\n&gt;into\n&gt; &gt; production might be a good thing. Not to mention the people that\n&gt;would\n&gt; &gt; colaborate to help out with any design flaws.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just a thought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Amy Sutter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; www.myspace.com/LON3_S7AR\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Check me out!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Food fight?
