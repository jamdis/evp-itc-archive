=C2=A0 

Hey Mark, i think i am the only on=
e out of the 4 you mentioned over here on this 
group. We are all over at R=
TSC, there is a lot more activity over there.

Are you still a member over =
there?

As for an investigation, i am trying to set up a date for the Red M=
ill Inn. If 
you are interested, i'll add you to the list. I'm thinking of =
getting Bruce 
Tango to hang out with us when we do it. I told him i would =
go over using the 
ghost box with him, i gave him one a year ago.
