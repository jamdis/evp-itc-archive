I know it&#39;s a subject that has been in the paranormal community for some time now. They are a lot that don&#39;t believe in the box and think that it&#39;s a lot of hogwash. All I can say is that people thought, that the Wright Brothers where crazy to think they could fly,  and where are we today! So I look at the box as a possibility and would like to better understand how this box may work.\n\nOne of my first questions is, what does ITC stand for?\n\nI know what EVP stands for (Electronic Voice Phenomenon). \n\nI am not a paranormal researcher nor do I belong to any ghost hunting/research group but, I do have a strong interest in it. My wife and I will go out at times to graveyards and/or place looking for paranormal activity. We did get some EVPs at once with a digital recorder.\n\nThank you,\n~Brian\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-1079165225-1229884024=:57051\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;Hello everyone&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name is Brian and I just joined the group to better understand how the box works.
