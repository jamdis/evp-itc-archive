I wanted to provide people with some free ideas on \nsome of the different ways to use some of the devices, and it grew \nfrom there.  Some of the videos get a few more thousand views than \nthe others.\nMy next free video on Youtube will be my mini-documentary about \nattempting to contact the plane crash victims from a certain crash, \nusing debris from that crash, and sessions at the crash scene.\nI&#39;ve already sent out debris packages to some researchers who are \ngoing to help. I start filming that one in two weeks. \n\nI&#39;ve listened to your internet radio program a few times.  Good stuff!\n\nHave a great day,\n- Mike C.

Can I just \nshake your hand dude? Your post about Radio Shack boxes and the \nuses... I like how you record in real time by the way using multiple \nradio shack boxes... (must be a pain in the butt to review)... \n&gt; \n&gt; P.S. I find the Radio Shack and Franks Box sessions in general to \nbe really chaotic and I find that I can only do the sessions in \nincrements of 5minutes...It drives my team batty hehe... but I \nreally like some of the results... Also, I tend to stay on AM band as \nFM generally is music and I mostly record the group Coldplay hehe...\n&gt;"}
