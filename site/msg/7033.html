I understand where you are coming from in respect in speaking their 
opinion, however if i had to read yet another post of how great 
someone is when nobody is great in this i was going to be sick.  
Arrogance and ego is very bad and that kind of mentality is Cancer to 
this research, i can share my opinion with the group but never tell 
anybody what to do.  I sit idly by and watch 200+ people get bad 
information on a daily basis, which hurts any good research.  The 
best way to go about what we are doing is to come up with our own 
theories and post them as examples for others to read.  We shouldn&#x27;t 
have anybody dictate every aspect of this as fact.  If anybody can 
give information on box use it would be Frank, who nobody who owns 
boxes has listened to...myself included.  He knows how they work and 
offers a great amount of knowledge to this subject or else none of us 
would even be here.  This board has started to be a dictatorship of 
one persons opinion and if nobody listened...they were wrong.  And to 
me, that&#x27;s wrong.  I started out with Joe&#x27;s box and moved forward and 
nobody helped me in my path.  I since aquired other boxes and taught 
myself them as well, which means it can be done.  People...do your 
own thing and get results the best way you can and learn from your 
mistakes, that&#x27;s what i did.  And getting Bruce his first Joe&#x27;s box 
and Frank&#x27;s box and getting him started in box research, i somewhat 
feel responsible for what transpired on this board and i apologize to 
those involved.  Frank, i&#x27;m sorry that another person has taken your 
box and claimed to know all and not listening to what you adhere we 
do.

Nuff Said,
-Steve H.

&gt; With all due respect, I am going to put my 2 bits in on this.  
&gt; 
&gt; I love the sharing of info, but have elected to post less and 
retire 
&gt; to reading more. :)
&gt; 
&gt; That said, I must agree with Ann that the initial post, though 
&gt; perhaps posted to be humorous, came off as disrespectful (in my 
&gt; opinion as a reader looking in on this forum) not only to BH but to 
&gt; FS.  BH does get animated at times, but he also brings some good 
&gt; input in here, too. 
&gt; 
&gt; We need to learn how to get along and work together.  Look at your 
&gt; initial post from someone else&#x27;s point of view and unban the poor 
&gt; fella&#x27;, won&#x27;t ya&#x27;?  ;)

&gt; &gt; I brought up a point in a lighthearted way, and it was NOT 
ABUSIVE, 
&gt; but
&gt; &gt; being abusive and attacking and degrading ones character is a 
&gt; totally
&gt; &gt; different scenario. There are 3 Mod&#x27;s on the board, and we 
discuss, 
&gt; before
&gt; &gt; choices are made. I am sorry if you are feeling conflict with is 
&gt; forum, if
&gt; &gt; your unhappy and want to un-join the choice is yours, we would 
&gt; certainly
&gt; &gt; hope you will re consider and have a better attitude with more

abusive

&gt; &gt; Jeff,
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Mind your buisness and go back to the kiddie table.
&gt; &gt; your not supposed to get involved in real peoples conversations.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; before you open your mouth read the post that this post was in 
&gt; reply too.
&gt; &gt; who are you to suggest anything, when was the last time anybody
&gt; &gt; saw any research or files from you? OOPS I forget nobody EVER did.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Stop sticking your mouth where it does not belong.

&gt; &gt; DON&quot;T BE HATIN!!
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; First off the reason I got a new box From Frank is because he 
&gt; recognises
&gt; &gt; that 
&gt; &gt; I am a serious researcher, It does not have anything to do with 
&gt; being a man 
&gt; &gt; or woman. It has to do with being deserving of a Frank&#x27;s box and 
&gt; evidently!
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Well do I have to spell it out? Start putting some time into your 
&gt; research
&gt; &gt; instead of
&gt; &gt; taking tantrums and maybe someday you&#x27;ll have a Frank&#x27;s box, But 
I 
&gt; doubt it!

&gt; &gt; hey guy&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have been lucky enough to not only have Frank&#x27;s box #12 but now 
&gt; Frank 
&gt; &gt; has gifted me with a brand new box #29.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here are the first files to come out of it. And it has not even 
&gt; been 
&gt; &gt; imprinted by mike and lisa yet. These files are from the first 30 
&gt; &gt; seconds of the first session.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; let me know what you think.
