    Thanks! We just moved--senior =
citizens and we just bought our first house! so just got e-mail back up yes=
terday. 

  It's so freaking ironic! The house is like a faraday cage, it's=
 all metal construction, metal frame, and even in between the frame is shee=
t metal, then the insulation and other rjunk. It didn't dawn on me till aft=
er we moved in and I tried to listen to AM radio. There almost nothing for =
AM reception in the middle of the house, and in the bathroom you have to se=
t the radio on the floor, in just the right spot to listen to C2C. The gara=
ge, where I intend to build my workshop is the same. AWWWWWW crap! Think I'=
ll be getting the saws all out and taking out some metal panels in the gatr=
age.

  The house was made in '47, and I think it's surplus battle ship fro=
m WWII!

  F-S

 I'm hearing what I want to hear. The first time I got my dad's friend Gord=
y, I didn't even hear his name; I thought he was saying "Forty, forty, fort=
y." It was only in a later session that he identified himself again using h=

 was very much alive), and that he'd been saying Gordy all along (confirmed=
 by playing back the old tape). I certainly didn't expect to hear him come =
through, and yet he did, so I can't see how I could've expected to hear his=
 name.

  the idea I'm hearing what I want to hear. The first ti=
me I got my dad's friend 
  Gordy, I didn't even hear his name; I thought h=
e was saying "Forty, forty, 
  forty." It was only in a later session that =
he identified himself again using 
  his full proper name. Then I realized =
that he is now dead (last I saw him he 
  was very much alive), and that he=
'd been saying Gordy all along (confirmed by 
  playing back the old tape).=
 I certainly didn't expect to hear him come 
  through, and yet he did, so =
I can't see how I could've expected to hear his 
  name.<BR>> > > =
