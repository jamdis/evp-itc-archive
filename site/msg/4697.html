&quot;I agree most people in the paranormal community (The Ghost Hunter
generation) do not have the understanding to grasp what we as a group
are saying.&quot;

I find this whole debate interesting, never thought of it in this
context before. I&#x27;ve been interested in the paranormal most of my life
and have wondered why, since I&#x27;ve had many people give me strange
looks and questions about my interests that other people who are into
stamp collecting, knitting or bird watching never get. Maybe its
because of some experiences I had as a child, or maybe its just part
of my personality. Regardless, that&#x27;s who I am and I&#x27;ve stopped
questioning myself or feeling a need to explain to others. I feel like
there&#x27;s a legitimate purpose for my interest, just haven&#x27;t found out
exactly what it is yet.

For me, going on paranormal investigations on location means trying to
determine of a place is &quot;haunted,&quot; what type of haunting it is and if
there is any action required. This is determined by use of certain
tools, one of which is EVP. Haunted to me means either residual energy
or an &quot;earth bound&quot; spirit who is not leaving a location for some
reason. Yes, I&#x27;ve heard of non-humans or demonics, but my jury is
still out on those.

Then we come to the EVP-ITC side of me, which in ways I consider
totally separate from paranormal investigation. My interpretations of
what is happening with this comes from The Scole Experiments book,
which I read a couple of years ago. I have no idea how I found out
about the book, but I did have to order it from the UK because at the
time it was not available in the US. Although I&#x27;m skeptical in nature
and tend to take things with a salt lick until I can research
something to my satisfaction, the Scole book was full of ideas and
concepts that I found exciting. To say it was food for thought is an
understatement. To think that there are people on the &quot;other side&quot;
wanting to communicate with us mortals makes the efforts we go through
even that much more meaningful and satisfying.

My next project will be building my own box, although right now I
personally tend to trust EVPs gathered with a recorder more. My
exposure to the Box has been thru Chris M&#x27;s interpretations and I
can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve spent enough time with the Box to actually hear or
understand anything from it. Maybe if I make my own I can educate my
hearing.

It appears the person who wrote the blog that started this thread has
not researched the concept behind the Box or current theories of the
range of the em spectrum and the relationship of spirit energy vs. our
limited abilities as humans to sense or perceive different ranges of
the spectrum. I&#x27;m not educated in this part of science, most of what
I&#x27;ve learned has been over the last couple of years via the Internet,
so I may sound like an idiot. But I feel that even what we have
identified in the em spectrum is limited to our equipment&#x27;s abilities.

Sorry for the soap box, but it felt good to write down what&#x27;s been in
my head. There aren&#x27;t many people I know that are interested in this
stuff so this Forum has been a real treat for me.

By the way, can I get a link to that blog? I&#x27;d be interested in
reading a little more of it. As others here have said, the person who
wrote it has not done his research and may not care to. No skin off my
nose, truth always wins out in the end, its just a matter of time. How
long did people believe that the world is flat?</pre>
