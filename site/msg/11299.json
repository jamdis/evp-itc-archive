I found the RS arm band radio works the best, t=\r\nhe 469 is a POS, mess with it too much and it quits working. I have one wit=\r\nh bad AM, and another with F&#39;d-Up FM. I found this Sony at the thrift store=\r\n of $6.99, don&#39;t know if it&#39;s usable yet, but it&#39;s better than $35 for the =\r\nRS. Anoither Honda radio, this one is only a maybe at this point. \n \n Techn=\r\no question; I see people making banks of RS 12-469s, and I can only ask why=\r\n!?  Some seem to have the technical expertise to build the sweep circuit, w=\r\nhy not just make a simple box that&#39;s proven to work? I wouldn&#39;t use that mu=\r\nlti-radio set up, it&#39;d be impossible to understand anything from it.  It wo=\r\nuld seem more cost effective to start wit something that works. \n \n The 12-=\r\n470 can use an external sweep voltage, but you have to locate the converter=\r\n stage that turns the digital pulses into a voltge the varactor can use. It=\r\n takes the 8 volts (max) for AM, but FM is weird, it tunes form +4 to 8 vol=\r\nts. I have newer car tuners like this as well. \n \n Frank\n \n \n______________=\r\n___________________________________________________\nInstantly invite friend=\r\ns from Facebook and other social networks to join you on Windows Live=99 Me=\r\nssenger.\nhttps://www.invite2messenger.net/im/?source=3DTXT_EML_WLH_InviteFr=\r\niends\r\n--_126f18c3-8c7c-43ab-8a19-f115689c16cc_\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;\n.hmmessage P\n{\nmargin:0px;\npadding:0px\n}\nbody.hmmessa=\r\nge\n{\nFONT-SIZE: 10pt;\nFONT-FAMILY:Tahoma\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body class=3D&#39;=\r\nhmmessage&#39;&gt;\nHi All;&lt;BR&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;\n&nbsp;Busy-busy-busy!
