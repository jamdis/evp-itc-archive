Most people watch th=\r\nese shows for the escape and entertainment value, like the rest of tv.   An=\r\nd these shows learn over time what loses audience (same old claims, boring =\r\nresults, etc), and what draws them back (wild claims, overall freak value, =\r\nand &quot;we must protect the children!&quot;).  This is all completely orthodox for =\r\ntv entertainment, but does lend itself to any kind of true research, or any=\r\n kind of actual edification.\n\n        So I think we can expect these shows =\r\nwill continue to ramp these sorts of elements up in order to compete, and w=\r\ne can expect them to dwell less on mundane and activity-free situations, an=\r\nd present more claims of evil entities, mysterious injuries, and unexplaina=\r\nble foul odors, accompanied by more frightened investigators, trembling sen=\r\nsitives, and humorously gullible associates and customers, and all wrapped =\r\nin fancier technology, scarier settings, and state-o-the-art editing.\n\n    =\r\n    Also: a little humor of the day:   http://comics.com/get_fuzzy/2009-04-=\r\n06/\n\n\n\n        --- On Sat, 4/4/09, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...=\r\nm&gt; wrote:\n\n\n          From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n    =\r\n      Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Is pride so wrong!?\n          To: EVP-ITC@=\r\nyahoogroups.com\n          Date: Saturday, April 4, 2009, 2:08 PM\n\n\n\n       =\r\n   Thanks Rick! You seem to have put alot of thought and time into that. \n\n=\r\n           What really bothers me is the self proclaimed experts out there =\r\nthat take all evidence and experience and try to make it negative, and evil=\r\n. Maybe many get tired, or even affraid of seeking paranormal experience fo=\r\nr that reason.\n\n           I don&#39;t do ghost hunts or invesitgations, but th=\r\ne hauntings I&#39;ve heard of seem to be nothing more than something trying to =\r\nget someone&#39;s attention. It&#39;s these experts that turn it into something tha=\r\nt must be negative.  There&#39;s Hollywood, such as the &quot;Haunting In CT&quot;, these=\r\n same experts will proclaim is based on fact, when the facts are probably n=\r\nothing more than your creaking floors, just to make the whole paranoramal f=\r\nield dark and demon filled. In my case, fear does not sell, I won&#39; watch th=\r\nose movies. \n\n           I think there is good EVP evidence, and I&#39;ve heard=\r\n many from various researchers.  Trouble is, it&#39;s like talking on a phone o=\r\nr radio, how do you know who it is other by what they say?\n\n           Fran=\r\nk-S\n\n          On Sat, Apr 4, 2009 at 2:47 PM, Rick &lt;rasterer@yahoo. com&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n\n            --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; &lt;pu=\r\nrplealiengirl@ ...&gt; wrote:\n\n            &gt; Just wondering, seemed like inter=\r\nest in EVP/ITC was dropping off. Too bad the interest in EVP doesn&#39;t pick u=\r\np while that ghost hunting mentality drops off. I keep saying, you&#39;ll get b=\r\netter, more consistent, and more meaningful messages if you record at home.=\r\n The ghosts, spirits and entities can and do travel. You also have to liste=\r\nn to the recordings more than once. \n            &gt; \n            &gt; Frank\n\n  =\r\n          That is an interesting observation. I think the core of the issue=\r\n is that there seems to be a `sweet spot&#39; in paranormal beliefs where there=\r\n is just enough science, just enough technical backing, just enough paranor=\r\nmal claims, and just enough indefinite evidence that keeps people intereste=\r\nd in the ghost hunting mentality\n\n            Evidence which becomes too in=\r\ndefinite turns off most people. As they become more aware of sensitives who=\r\n simply make claims (&quot;I feel there is a GHOST here!&quot;), but provide no evide=\r\nnce other than statements, people eventually get bored. Similarly, people e=\r\nventually grow tired of the anthropomorphism of every little occurrence in =\r\na house: a creak implies a footstep, which implies a person, which, if not =\r\nseen, implies a ghost. But a creak does not equal a footstep.\n\n            =\r\nAnd while this kind of indefinite evidence can lose an audience, so can evi=\r\ndence that is claimed to be &quot;obviously&quot; evident by technology. Here, the in=\r\nvestigator is no longer making vague claims, but waving science around, lik=\r\ne FLIR cameras, or EMF meters, and then making proclamations of the results=\r\n. But again, people eventually see these are just lights and sounds from el=\r\nectronics, and investigators making more claims. It&#39;s like the psychics aga=\r\nin, but with visual aids.\n\n            I think the reason EVP studies are n=\r\not securing more interest, as you noted, are a little of both effects. Firs=\r\nt is the anthropomorphism problem: I notice many EVP experimenters proclaim=\r\n what their results sound like, or name the sound file by what they&#39;ve hear=\r\nd. But like the creaks, &quot;sounds like&quot; does not equal &quot;is&quot;. This is then com=\r\npounded by the technology backing: regardless of how valid the EVP research=\r\ner&#39;s results are, the technology can seem intimidating, but the researchers=\r\n often proclaim the obviousness of their results. People again become turne=\r\nd off by it because it is not obvious to them, and in the end it is just an=\r\nother piece of technology presenting sounds, with no obvious connection to =\r\nthe paranormal, except by the claims and interpretations of the presenters.=\r\n\n\n            I believe, taking these issues into account, there is a way f=\r\nor EVP studies to garner more interest. For now, the analysis coming from t=\r\nhe researchers usually seems like a claim, and it is these claims, imho, th=\r\nat is being classified by the public with the rest of the paranormal claims=\r\n, and so, it also becomes less of an interest. A new approach could be one =\r\nwithout the claims and interpretations of the investigators, one where the =\r\nsounds are simply played and not labeled. The interpretation of the data co=\r\nuld be left to the listeners. Web sites which present EVPs could be develop=\r\ned where people could not see others interpretations until they entered the=\r\nir own. I think this would be such a novel approach, that it would give the=\r\n public a better feeling of true involvement in the research, and feel less=\r\n like they are simply being exposed to the claims of others. And I think th=\r\nat feeling of involvement is what is needed to reignited the public interes=\r\nt here.\n\n\n\n       \n\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_0061_01C9B69B.018BE020\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18702&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 =\r\nface=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;Sweet! :)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myri=\r\nad Pro&quot;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;That&#39;s =\r\nquality TV programming&nbsp;right \nthere!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 =\r\nface=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: =\r\n#000000 2px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px;=\r\n MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; \ndir=3Dltr&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;----- Ori=\r\nginal Message ----- &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV \n  style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial; BACKGROUND:=\r\n #e4e4e4; font-color: black&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; \n  &lt;A title=3Drasterer@... =\r\nhref=3D&quot;mailto:rasterer@...&quot;&gt;Rj&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt=\r\n arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A title=3DEVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP=\r\n-ITC@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FO=\r\nNT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Monday, April 06, 2009 9:28 \nAM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Is pride so \n  =\r\nwrong!?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n  &lt;P&gt;\n  &lt;TABLE borde=\r\nr=3D0 cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0&gt;\n    &lt;TBODY&gt;\n    &lt;TR&gt;\n      &lt;TD vAlig=\r\nn=3Dtop&gt;Frank, I think you are right in that the reason for the \n        ne=\r\ngativity and sensationalism in these shows is that it sells \n        better=\r\n.&nbsp; Most people watch these shows for the escape and \n        entertain=\r\nment value, like the rest of tv.&nbsp;&nbsp; And these shows \n        learn=\r\n over time what loses audience (same old claims, boring results, \n        e=\r\ntc), and what draws them back (wild claims, overall freak value, and \n     =\r\n   &quot;we must protect the children!&quot;).&nbsp; This is all completely orthodox =\r\n\n        for tv entertainment, but does lend itself to any kind of true res=\r\nearch, \n        or any kind of actual edification.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So I think we can=\r\n expect these \n        shows will continue to ramp these sorts of elements =\r\nup in order to \n        compete, and we can expect them to dwell less on mu=\r\nndane and \n        activity-free situations, and present more claims of evi=\r\nl entities, \n        mysterious injuries, and unexplainable foul odors, acc=\r\nompanied by more \n        frightened investigators, trembling sensitives, a=\r\nnd humorously gullible \n        associates and customers, and all wrapped i=\r\nn fancier technology, scarier \n        settings, and state-o-the-&lt;WBR&gt;art e=\r\nditing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also: a little humor \n        of the day:&nbsp;&nbsp; \n     =\r\n   http://comics.&lt;WBR&gt;com/get_fuzzy/&lt;WBR&gt;2009-04-06/&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On =\r\n\n        &lt;B&gt;Sat, 4/4/09, Frank Sumption \n        &lt;I&gt;&lt;purplealiengirl@&lt;WB=\r\nR&gt;gmail.com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n        &lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT=\r\n: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: \n          Frank Sumption &lt;purplea=\r\nliengirl@&lt;WBR&gt;gmail.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: \n          [EVP-ITC] Re: Is pri=\r\nde so wrong!?&lt;BR&gt;To: \n          EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Satur=\r\nday, April 4, 2009, 2:08 \n          PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n          &lt;DIV id=3Dyiv13898=\r\n06274&gt;\n          &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n          &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;Than=\r\nks Rick!
