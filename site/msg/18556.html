Oh I am not making any claims.=C2=A0 Just testing claims I've heard.
If the=
 claim is that spirits cannot know things that the human operator cannot kn=
ow, or spirits can travel astrally to anywhere, or spirits can tell us the =
future (spirits, or whatever is claimed to speak through the box) then mayb=
e my experiments will help me form a conclusion one way or the other there,=
 that is not based on stories I've heard, but the best objective procedures=
 I can come up with.
