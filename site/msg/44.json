Then its seems that it opened a door for them, they are conversing amongst themselves saying hello to each other, that they can see, they can see the computer, one of them said he was beseiged. I didnt record again till yesterday, and i kinda wonder if they are mad? i kept getting vibes to record but have been to tired with moving. Can they get mad with you? i assume they can. When i recorded, i have been using microsoft word and typing my questions, and a little bit of talking too, if they can see the computer &lt;so they said&gt; why not?! I also used this thing from EVP maker that shows pictures and makes clicks and tones. The only thing they had to say was &quot;watch&quot; watch&quot;, wether they ment to not say anything and just watch me or ref to some of the questions i had, i dont know, cant assume anything lol. What can i do to get them to talk to me\n more? Answer questions? like no one has indentified themselves and i would really like to know who they are. I have a few people i would like to talk to that have passed over. However anyone is nice lol. I just would like to open this door MORE now, that i have closed off. I think that I opened a doorway for them but i want to interact more! People have been refering to me as a &quot;sensitive&quot;? I assume meaning that i am able to tell if they are here etc. Which i usually can. Is it possible that because in the past for the most part i have kept this part of me closed off, except those entities that refuse to be silenced come through, that they are skeptical of talking to me? That i cant handle it?\n\n    \n\n    Anyway, justthought id talk with somemore people who have &quot;been there done that&quot;\n\n    I would like to have someone over who has alot of history and do an evp in my home and talk to them for me. &lt;sigs&gt;\n\n    \n\n    Amy\n\n    \n\n  \n    http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/\n\n    \n\n    LON3_S7AR  YAHOO MESENGER ID\n\n   __________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
