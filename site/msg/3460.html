<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The first one i hear &quot;Ghost would Talk&quot;.  The first part says &quot;You 
are the mover&quot; or something with the &quot;M&quot; sound in it.  I would 
disregard the first part and say the file says &quot;Ghosts would talk&quot;, 
i think that is the message.  The second one i hear exactly like you 
and everyone else would hear it too.  Very clear, i don&#x27;t know what 
it means but very clear.

&gt; Bruce,
&gt; I just wanted to drop a line and say Amen!   Granted, the 
electronic element is the &#x27;e&#x27; in EVP (and the &#x27;i&#x27; in ITC), but the 
most accomplished researchers (including Maggy and Jules, Konstantin 
and Friedrich, and yes, Mark Macy, insist that if you have the 
harmony, love, and RESONANCE among researchers, all the electronic 
problems can be overcome.  
&gt; Is anyone involved in the AA-EVP &#x27;Big Circle&#x27; group?  I see that 
they attempt contact all at once from their own homes around the 
country, I think on Thursday evenings at a set time.
&gt; Is anyone interested in this?  From what I see, and from my own 
new interest, it seems most of us try contacts as much as possible 
throughout the day.  Anyone want to try a set time?

&gt; Hello Bruce,Forgive me for bluntness, but typing in all capital 
letters is considered to be shouting by some of us. It&#x27;s also hard 
to follow. Absolutely no offense intended... I just thought you 
should know.Thanks,Lance--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &#x27;bhali333&#x27; 
&lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; HI GUY&#x27;S JUST A SHORT 
EXPLANATION OF WHAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ANYONE THAT 
IS A SERIOUS EVP RESEARCHER HAS PROBABLY READ THE ARTICLES &gt; AND OR 
BOOKS PERTAINING TO THE EALY TIME STREAM EXPERIMENTS AND WHAT &gt; WAS 
CALLED THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT. IT INVOLVED SUCH RESEARCHERS AS MAGGY &gt; 
HERSHBACH AND HER HUSBAND THAT WHERE THE RECIPIENTS OF LONG LENGTHY 
&gt; MESSAGES IN ALL DIFFERENT FORMATS FROM THE SPIRIT WORLD THEY IN 
TURN &gt; WORKED WITH SUCH EVP PIONEERS AS HANS MUELLER, KONSTANTINE &gt; 
RAUDIVA,GEORGE MEEK AND MARK MACY TO NAME A FEW. THESE EARLY 
PIONEERS &gt; THROUGH THE HERSHBACHS IN LUXEMBORG RECIEVED DETAILED 
INSTRUCTIONS ON &gt; HOW TO FURTHER COMMUNICATION THAT NOT ONLY LED TO 
OUR CURRENT EVP &gt; GATHERING TECHNIQUES BUT ALSO THE MOTHER OF ALL 
BOXES THE SPIRICOM.&gt; THESE RESEARCHERS WERE TOLD THE MOST IMPORTANT 
INGREDIANT IN THE &gt; STRENGTH AND FURTHERENCE OF SPIRIT COMMUNICATION 
WAS HARMONY AND PEACE &gt; AND GOOD INTENTIONS WITHIN THIS CIRCLE THEY 
HAD BEEN LED TO FORM.&gt; &gt; BUT SADLY AS HUMAN BEINGS USUALLY DO 
JELOUSY AND EGO BECAME A POISON TO &gt; THE CIRCLE AND SOME INDIVIDUALS 
THAT WHERE ENVIOUS OF OTHERS SUPERIOR &gt; SUCESSES BROUGHT BAD 
VIBRATIONSS TO THE GROUP AND THE CIRCLE WAS BROKEN.&gt; &gt; IMMEDIATLY 
FOLLOWING THE ADVANCED COMMUNICATION THAT HAD BEEN ENJOYED &gt; FOR A 
NUMBER OF YEARS SLOWLY DWINDLED AWAY.&gt; &gt; NOW I BELIEVE WE ARE BEING 
GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS &gt; UNPRESIDENTED TASK AND 
BRIDGE THE GAP OF COMMUNICATION FULLY.&gt; AS OF LATE THERE HAS BEEN A 
FLOOD OF NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT SEEMS TO BE &gt; WORKING AS HOPED WE ARE 
IN OUR FETAL STAGES BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD WE &gt; WILL BE BROUGHT ALONG 
SLOWELY AND CAREFULLY.&gt; &gt; SO MY THOUGHTS ARE LETS KEEP THE GOOD 
VIBES AND HARMONY GOING AND BLOCK &gt; AS MUCH OF THE NEGATIVITY AS WE 
CAN AND ALL WORK TOGETHER TWORD THIS &gt; COMMON GOAL. LETS NOT LET THE 
SINS OF OUR FATHER SO TO SPEAK AFFECT &gt; WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH.&gt; &gt; 
BRUCE HALLIDAY&gt;
