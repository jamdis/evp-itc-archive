<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Adriana,

I don&#x27;t think any of us have any idea. There has been some evidence
that some EVP recordings are meant for one individual only.  I&#x27;ve been
on investigations where there were 5 or more people recording audio
simultaneously and only one got an EVP ... then later another person
got a different EVP and no one else.

With ITC, it&#x27;s a whole different game.  It appears someone somewhere
is selectively making a tuner pass certain words or parts of words
from a radio station and having those come through as messages. The
mechanism seems to be completely different than the ghost hunting EVP.

Sort of like the difference between talking to someone and driving
your car into their garage.
