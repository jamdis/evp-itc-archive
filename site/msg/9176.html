I am a libertarian and believer in the laissez-faire market system (I use 
the lower-case libertarian as a subscriber to a political philosophy, not 
necessarily as a member of a political party). I figure that if this 
person is going to sell them and people are going to pay these prices, 
then that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to happen.  That market isn&#x27;t going to go on 
forever, and sooner or later people are not going to pay that much, if 
anything, for his product if they figure out it can be done more cheaply. 
Let supply and demand meet until demand diminishes. So I agree with the 
&quot;Do Nothing.&quot;

(Note it&#x27;s not me selling them - I only have one eBay logon and it&#x27;s w9sz, 
same as my ham radio callsign.)
