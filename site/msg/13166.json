They are my files from the crash impact \npoint. These are the only files I captured there.\nEach session is represented by three files..\n(1) the raw capture.. \n(2)the raw capture with noise removed and slight amplification... \n(3)processed file using echo/frequency additions stimulated by file \n(2).\nThis way others can listen or use any of the file variations for \ntheir own research.\nI&#39;ll be adding files from sessions at the gravesites and lab using \ncrash debris next week.\nI used mostly the processed files in the video.  By linking all the \nfiles on my website, I provide others an avenue to listen and use all \nof them.\n\nRJ says he hears only noise...\n\nNoise in a certain patterns could be taken as a word or words. \nMyself, I hear certain patterns of noise in portions of some of the \nfiles.  Are they words or phrases?  Could be.  Is what I think I \nheard relivent to this event (a crash)?\nYes... So, I believe I have captured something related to this event \nwith at least a portion of my ITC session.\n\nI&#39;ve read and heard that not everyone always hears the same thing... \nbut it doesn&#39;t mean something is not there.\n\n- Mike C.

He is just sharing as he goes. Giving the \nraw \n&gt; audio for those who would rather have that than the processed or \n&gt; denoised files. Interesting sounds tho. \n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; - In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rj &lt;rasterer@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On going through them all, I think I see now that you did not \npost \n&gt; 12 samples. You posted perhaps four, with 2 or 3 duplicates as \n&gt; they&#39;ve been variously processed. Is this the case? The \nprocessing \n&gt; to me sounds like audio-cleanup processing, based on the amount of \n&gt; audio pixelation it seems to have introduced, some rather severe? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, I didn&#39;t hear anything in any of these other than \nnoise. \n&gt; Is there anything particular you wanted to highlight? Were you \n&gt; looking for any input?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Sun, 12/28/08, Rj &lt;rasterer@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Rj &lt;rasterer@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Audio files from my impact point ITC \nsessions\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Sunday, December 28, 2008, 8:46 AM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for posting.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think in your original experimental specs, you request five 30 \n&gt; second audio clips from five-to-ten people. Which would be 25-50 \n&gt; clips. Here you&#39;ve posted 12. Will you be posting the others?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, I&#39;d like to hear from the people who created these clips. \n&gt; How did you go about that? Did you do exactly five 30 second \nclips? \n&gt; Or did you do more, and send in just the best?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Sun, 12/28/08, M.A. Coletta (Mike) &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: M.A. Coletta (Mike) &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Audio files from my impact point ITC sessions\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Sunday, December 28, 2008, 8:23 AM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     \n&gt; &gt;             Audio Files From Crash Impact Point ITC Sessions\n&gt; &gt; Feel free to download and analyze yourself\n&gt; &gt; Impact Point Diode #1 Raw Audio\n&gt; &gt; Impact Point Diode #1 Reduced Noise Audio\n&gt; &gt; Impact Point Diode #1 Final Processed Audio\n&gt; &gt; Impact Point Diode #3 Raw Audio\n&gt; &gt; Impact Point Diode #3 Reduced Noise Audio\n&gt; &gt; Impact Point Diode #3 Final Processed Audio\n&gt; &gt; Impact Point Transistor #1 Raw Audio\n&gt; &gt; Impact Point Transistor #1 Reduced Noise Audio\n&gt; &gt; Impact Point Transistor #1 Final Processed Audio\n&gt; &gt; Impact Point Raudive Recorder Raw Audio\n&gt; &gt; Impact Point Raudive Recorder Reduced Noise Audio\n&gt; &gt; Impact Point Raudive Recorder Final Processed Audio\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
