I do know about the noise filters and how much to use. I prefer to keep my =
audio as raw as possible. I mainly play with the volume controls and with j=
ust a little noise reduction.

  M-Ka=
y, for the same reasons I was drawn to Audacity. I have tried Goldwave a fe=
w times. But couldn't remember the features. The High or Low pass filters a=
re very helpfull. As well as the pitch (this changes the voice either highe=
r or lower) that helps bring it out of the "muddy" static level. As far as =
using the "noise eliminator" be careful here...a little goes a long way. It=
 will make you audio sound like a bad organ piano :) The high or low filter=
 actually does what we are wanting the noise filter to do anyway. And doesn=
't add its own melodies. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, "April Abercrombie=

TCH is a very handy tool. Always KEEP an original copy of your recordings. =
I just save a copy from inside audacity (to desktop or somewhere) then I wi=

 WAV (is bigger) but higher qulity. Can always convert the wav to mp3 from =

 is a pretty good program to have round. Has a nice "undo" fesature too, if=
 you make a mistake. Happy Hunting ;) Jim H --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com,=

  <P>M-Kay, for the same reasons I was drawn to Audacity. =
I have tried Goldwave 
  a few times. But couldn't remember the features. T=
he High or Low pass filters 
  are very helpfull. As well as the pitch (thi=
s changes the voice either higher 
  or lower) that helps bring it out of t=
he "muddy" static level. As far as using 
  the "noise eliminator" be caref=
ul here...a little goes a long way. It will 
  make you audio sound like a =
bad organ piano :) The high or low filter actually 
  does what we are want=
ing the noise filter to do anyway. And doesn't add its 
  own melodies. ---=

  <BR>> Hi, give the AUDACITY software another try. Ha=
s option to slow the 
  recording down. Another nice feature is that you ca=
n use either a highpass or 
  lowpass filter (sometimes that is all that is=
 needed) and changing the PITCH 
  is a very handy tool. Always KEEP an ori=
ginal copy of your recordings. I just 
  save a copy from inside audacity (=
to desktop or somewhere) then I will start 
  my work on trying to clear it=
 up. Save the original (and proceeding enhanced 
  version(s) by using the =
"file" button at to left corner oif program. There you 
  would SAVE "selec=
tion" as MP3.(To upload to here) or save to WAV (is bigger) 
  but higher q=
ulity. Can always convert the wav to mp3 from withing audacity 
  also. *yo=
u will need to get the mps "pluging" from the website, and follow the 
  in=
formation to install it "manually" (once is only needed) that way you get 
=
  the mp3 converter program free. But really...Audacity is a pretty good pr=
ogram 
  to have round. Has a nice "undo" fesature too, if you make a mista=
ke. Happy 
  Hunting ;) Jim H --- In <A
