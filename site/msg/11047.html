&gt;           Just wanted to introduce myself. My name is Carla and I 
recorded my first evp 2 nights ago. 
&gt; Again yesterday I was able to get another one but have not been able 
to tell what it says. I 
&gt; am going to post them in the file section if anyone is interested. I 
also was wondering what 
&gt; everyone thought, especially on the 2nd one since I still don&#x27;t know 
what it says. Thanks!
