<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi LC,

Oops... I loaded the wrong set of pictures.  It wasn&#x27;t in the final 
state of weird yet.  Now I&#x27;ve updated the pics to reflect what goes 
on those prongs.  I guess maybe those are vocal cords for the dead???

I&#x27;ve got to stop eating pickels, peppers, and ice cream before bed!

&gt; Interesting, Mike.  
&gt; 
&gt; I am wondering how it will work...nothing seems to make sense to me 
&gt; with any of this, but somehow we are getting responses. LOL  
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday, I thought of your little Listen Up! audio amplifier with 
the 
&gt; Y adapter, headphones and the recorder as an EVP recorder set-up 
for 
&gt; real time audio EVP on investigations.  My plan is to suit-up one 
of my 
&gt; EVP specialists and test in the field within the next couple 
weeks.  
&gt; Perhaps, they might be able to hear the replies as it is being 
&gt; recorded, so they can then ask questions.  Interestingly enough, I 
just 
&gt; received an EVP over top of my ghost box sweeping audio on Friday.  
&gt; Weird. However, I did not envision the chamber with &quot;prongs&quot;(?) 
like 
&gt; you built, though.  
&gt; 
&gt; LOL  Can&#x27;t wait to hear about your results.

&gt; &gt; You know me and my weird devices... yes I&#x27;ve built another.
&gt; &gt; This one came to me in a dream last night.  I think it was 
because 
&gt; some 
&gt; &gt; of you guys were talking about echo chambers.
&gt; &gt; Anyway... when I woke up I went looking around the house for 
stuff to 
&gt; &gt; make this thing before I forgot what it looked like in my dream.
&gt; &gt; I completed it but now I guess I must test it to see if it is 
what I 
&gt; &gt; think it is... an EVP Box, maybe???
