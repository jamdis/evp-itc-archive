William,

Misty has already left for work so if you don't mind I will tell you what the water method is, as she is the one who taught me how to do it. It is very simple.... All you need is a recorder and a faucet. I have used several different speeds from a slight drip to a full roaring shower. I don't talk during the recording, instead I ask my questions or make any comments before I record.  I then record anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, anything over that and you will risk fatiguing your ear trying to hear the voices. 

Once you have recorded upload the files to your computer. Misty has developed 2 different filters on Clear Voice Denoiser that will clean out the static and crackle and amplify the voice tones. Then with Audacity or some other sound editing program she will change the speed by slowing the recording down by 74%. Of course this works for her ear and not mine. I use her second filter and do not slow it down at all. 

Whenever I use this method I get very good class A voices. If you wanna try it let her know and she will be happy to send you the filters.

Regards,

Frank R.

  What is the water method?

        I find some like certain methods better to make thier voice. And often they will state thier approval or disapproval for the method I am experimenting with. A few do not like music method they say its too much noise they cant get a word in edgewise, yet others enjoy it and make use of it with ease speaking very loud over the music notes. For water method nobody complains (i dont know why) and for sweep methods,
 only a few seem to have trouble using it to form thier words.
   
  Perhaps it has to do with vibrational frequencies I dont know. Once the lines are open and communication is flowing it gets interesting to say the least =)
   
  Just experiment and find whats working best for you personally.

communications come through as bits of radio waves put together to
form words or sentences, and other times, they sound more like
traditional evps. One of the little things I'm trying to figure out
is why I could never get evps from him after a year of trying, but he
has taken to communicating through the box like a fish to water.
