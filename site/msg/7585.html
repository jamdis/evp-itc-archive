&gt; I am extremely greatful to have gotten a box and I&#x27;m more than  
&gt; happy to share the audio as well as doing sessions with anyone if  
&gt; they would like to experience one of Frank&#x27;s wonderful devises.   
&gt; Some of the previous owners of the boxes don&#x27;t seem willing to  
&gt; share, or feel a need to charge you for the experience.  I think  
&gt; this is a terrible!!!  Frank had spent many hours building this  
&gt; devices, and believe this was never his intention for people to  
&gt; keep their experience and audio to themselves or to profit in anyway.
&gt;
&gt; Therefore, anyone wanting to sit in on a session is more than  
&gt; welcome.  Some of us here get together via Skype free internet  
&gt; phone, allowing an opportunity for anyone to take part and share  
&gt; the experience.  Just because you don&#x27;t have  FB doesn&#x27;t mean you  
&gt; can&#x27;t experience and take part in great communication.  Prior to me  
&gt; owning one, I sat in with Steve and Bruce, allowing me an  
&gt; opportunity to listen to their FB&#x27;s (which they both have  
&gt; differently unique boxes) and do my own recordings.  To them I was  
&gt; very greatful, and I never felt left off.
&gt;
&gt; Many of us have various boxes and conduct sessions differently,  
&gt; this allows us additional ways to learn from each other and  
&gt; experience all the boxes.
&gt;
&gt; If anyone is interested, please just let me know, some of you hear  
&gt; already can confirm these get togethers and you walk away with a  
&gt; greater respect for each other and spirit communication.

&gt; &gt; I believe it was Rosemary who was on C2C in December who stated she
&gt; had two of your boxes. One of them was 22 and the other was 21 or
&gt; 23. I can&#x27;t remember which other one but they are consecutive
&gt; numbers.

&gt; &gt; If anyone would care to go to my site that I set up to
&gt; share
&gt; &gt; information(http://purplealiengirl.tripod.com/), they will hear how
&gt; my
&gt; &gt; contacts swear I am their long lost Purple Princess. It would be
&gt; &gt; difficult for me to biased against women since I am one on the
&gt; inside,
&gt; &gt; even &quot;normal&quot; ghosts claim they see a woman. While a straight,
&gt; albeit
&gt; &gt; old, male, I prefer the feminine side of things. Purple is not so
&gt; much
&gt; &gt; a type of alien, or Planet. It&#x27;s a spiritual designation, as in the
&gt; &gt; Purple Lady, or someone on a spiritual mission. I don&#x27;t understand
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; completely either, but it&#x27;s connected to the Catholics some how. I
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t want to get caught up in religious dogma.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The people with boxes were supposed to be testing them, not going
&gt; off
&gt; &gt; on ego trips, and claiming to be great mediums which was somehow
&gt; &gt; bestowed on them by box use. There is one guy that got four, and
&gt; &gt; claimed none worked, so that&#x27;s four out of circulation. Yeah, I am
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; bit on the gullible side. There some I can&#x27;t account for, like #21,
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; have no idea where it is, or if I skipped a number. A woman in San
&gt; &gt; Diego did get a box directly from me last year, but somehow, Moon
&gt; ended
&gt; &gt; up with it. After last year, of almost non-stop box building, I
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; reached a point where I dread making them for people anymore.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Rosemary Guiley has one, Robin ( a local researcher&#x27;s wife) got one
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; December for thier wedding. Woman in San Diego had one. There are
&gt; women
&gt; &gt; that are deserving of boxes, and who have waited the longest, but I
&gt; &gt; dread giving anymore because it creates more demand.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s just a raido for crying out loud!
