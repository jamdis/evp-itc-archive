&gt; Your recordings sound as if they are being played in
&gt; reverse, rather than in the normal foward mode.

&gt; Not sure it ever was. I had a good group session the other
&gt; day so 
&gt; thought I would share some of what came thru with the
&gt; online crowd. A 
&gt; few are too long sentence wise to post here so I stuck them
&gt; in my 
&gt; esnips account. They were pretty well spoken (for my ears)
&gt; and I was 
&gt; pleasantly surprised at the depth of the messages that came
&gt; thru.
