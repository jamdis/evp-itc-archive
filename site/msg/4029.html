yep workin together gets alot more accomplished =)
   
  Hey Mike did you happen to get the podcast of rosemary I tried to catch it but forgot til it was too late so when i turned it on it was on the next guys. Then tonight they replay it so I was going to play it at work but can ya believe the dang radio there does not dial down low enough to hit 540 wfla. So came home flipped it on anad again i just missed her LOL.
   
  I should get a membership there i listen enough but I havent yet.
   
  Oh and I did your 470 hack...great video like I said I felt I could do it and I DID do it. Hacked the radio no problem its scanning as it should be, but in process of taking apart and putting back together a wire popped loose and had to be taken to a friends to be soldered. Got it back hiome was about to put it together again and theres another long wire popped off pokin out LOL first one was to battery compartment second was to speaker....
   
  So took that and resoldered it back on...got it home put it together turned it on and its scanning its scanning...its static...all static...no stations now LOL
   
  Last week when I was on the phone ordering it there were voices and I recorded them as I spoke on the phone to the guy and while he stuck me on hold. They pretty much told me dont mess with that method. Too bad I didnt hear it til after I finished ordering LOL
   
  Oh well. C'est la vie!
   
  And next time you are in friggin Cocoa beach let some of us know we are in Florida right down the road from there in orlando =)
   
  I dunno if I am gonna mess with that rs radio anymore. I am thinkin that they didnt approve and I screwed somethin up to help reinforce that notion. Maybe send it to one of you guys to poke at or tear apart.
   
  So are you and bruce and Steve workin together? I heard the "radio show" announcement and saved the link to go back and listen (need to make those suckers downloadable even if its off esnips or somewhere LOL) so we can play em in the car on the way to/from work. I clicked to save from download but it only wants to play and not "save as"
   
  Great job on the videos too. Really proud of you for getting that out there and being so professional about it and hell you even talked be into tearing one open and modifying it. I still say I did it right because it scans like it is supposed to. I just think somethin else popped off that wont let it pick up stations now. Worked fine before I touched it anyway LOL
   
  Ok I am done rambling now. Thats 2 questions one bout the podcast of REG and one on your show on steves link.
   
  LOL

          Hi Frank R., Bruce, and all...,

Yea... this is what I'm talkin' about!!! We are now getting people 
to try all types of configurations with all the different type 
products. This is an exciting time! We are really getting into 
research and comparison. Hey... this EVP-ITC team work stuff is cool!

I just got back home from a biz trip to Florida, so now I can 
continue on my 12-470/12-469 hack add-ons experiments.
I haven't yet heard Rosemary on c2c last night... so I think I'll 
download the show and listen now. After reading some other posts it 
sounds like she shared some good words about the devices.

- Mike
