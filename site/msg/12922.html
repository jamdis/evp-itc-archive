That could be a possibilty but also remember if you were an a-hole in life =
it's not going to change because you pass over. I had a haunting in NH wher=
e this was very much the case.

Also there are variables like entities from=
 the lower planes that can come through when recording, vortex's that might=
 allow opportunities to go from the other side to here, alien contact or ma=
ybe simple interfences.

I think sometis it maybe one who tries to intimida=
te us while recording. 

I am also  Clairaudient  and here the spirits that=
 are stronger talk out loud.

I do believe there is a mix of good and evil =
of course in the spirit realm and some are pranksters. I often delete or no=
t share the negative EVP'S unless it seems to be relevant to the current wo=
rk at hand.

I have always beleived that perception can also play into how =
we hear an EVP. 

I have had the clearest EVP'S and have had several people=
 listen to them to only find out that almost every person heard it differen=
tly. Factors being computer, speakers, and your audio software.


Just some=
 thoughts.

Hope everyone ahs a nice Thanksgiving!

        I have no real advice to add to this topic:=
 but a thought that came to me while reading your messages.

        What i=
f there is 'crime' in the ethereal as well as our physical world (from the =
good vs evil idea) ... and maybe an energy can possess or draw from another=
 less powerful energy and 'change' it?

        What do you think?

    If you are hearing spirits, that's not EVP, but Clairaudience. Another =
thing to note is she may or may not have been talking to you at all. They t=
alk amongst themselves a lot more than to us. She was probably not even tal=
king to you. I'm not sure why people always assume energies are always talk=
ing to them or label them "evil" because of the sound of the voice they are=
 modulating. That's a great error in my opinion. A really nice energy might=
 sound like a stereotypical Hollywood "demon". To stereotype energies, to m=
e, is just silly.
