also. With Dr. Pompeii's audio spotlight he can cause sound to manifest in =

          Yes, you =

                  A mistake that a lot of people mak=

 that same spectrum just farther down with much longer waves. Soundwaves an=

. The shorter the wavelength the more ways we can shield against them.

   =
               Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and tele=
metry transmitting wave but the waves also have a physical effect on our en=
vironment by causing molecules to speed up, which creates heat. A little lo=
wer than this is IR or infrared it too can cause physical objects to heat u=
p but usually it just causes molecules to rotate in place. All physical thi=
ngs give off IR light. Its a way the total system conserves energy by spont=

                    Here i=
s some food for thought. I am currently reviewing my audio from our May 30t=
h investigation.

                    It was me and another girl teammate p=
resent in the room. I picked up a 3rd female voice on my digital voice reco=
rder that I carry with me. We were standing right next to another digital v=
ideo recorder that I leave beside my night vision camera. That recorder did=
 not pick up this 3rd voice. I have asked the girl that was with me to chec=
k her recording to see if she picked it up.

                    I have lon=
g felt the true EVP does not come from sound waves in the environment, or t=
hen it wouldn't be EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow EVP's are appearin=
g directly on the recordings.

                    This instance with the r=
ecorders may back that theory up. That other recorder should have picked th=
at voice up if it were sound waves in the environment.

                   =
 I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. The file that is named "01-02-1=
7 Clip" is the full clip. You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah", and then =
another comes in right after that. I think I know what it says.

          =
          Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but still did not hear thi=
s until playback. It isn't clear, so I am not as excited about it as my one=
's from the last investigation.

                      I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an unt=
rasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It wor=
ks off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that diffe=
r one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them together you ge=
t a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sendi=
ng a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating an unt=
rasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate difference fre=
quency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was j=
ust an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic signals j=
ust by turning them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP were genera=
ted within a few inches of the recorder.

                            We ar=
e able to reproduce this affect in not only radio with superheterodyne syst=
ems but also with acoustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a comme=

IV>I have a running theory that EVP is carried on

    an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where 
                     =
       they want it to manifest. It works off the 
                        =
    heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic 
                      =
      waves that differ one another in frequency then if 
                 =
           you add or subtract them together you get a beat 
              =
              frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a 
        =
                    ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an 
   =
                         electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic 
   =
                         frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermedia=
