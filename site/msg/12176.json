It was one of strangest things I have \ncaught on EVP. We also had a wireless microphone in the room which did \nnot pick up the &quot;whisper&quot;. So it was definitely centered on the \ndigital voice recorder, which was sitting on a dresser during that \nparticular time.\n\nRegards,\n\nRob Stone\nIn Nomine Paranormal Research\nFort Wayne, Indiana\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Rob,\n&gt; \n&gt; Not sure but I definitely hear a whispery voice behind the person \nspeaking.
