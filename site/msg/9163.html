Gotta jump in on this one.  About one year ago I was trying to track down Frank S and his magic ghost box.  Took me months to find this forum Frank and all that comes with it.   But understand this, had I found the RS Hack and the language they are using on ebay one year ago, that would have been a Great deal at $100.00 or whatever.   AND if I would have seen some form of design plan with explanation on how to hack an RS radio on ebay, I would have done that before buying the radio.  This is the free market country, I like the idea of posting or advertising on ebay the hack info at cost.  Let people on ebay decide what to buy, (another) BUT don't do it with negativity or malice...do it in service to others.  Get the word out on ebay with a tag about this forum as well.  Ron L

awareness into a forum (ebay) where it is desperately needed. 

Was it not you who recently stated sellers who take advantage of others in this way are "no 
more than thieves without guns" and "should not be patronized no matter the 
circumstances." You have characterized them as "wolves" and "demons" but now are 
saying "do nothing." Which, honestly, I could understand if my suggestion was coming 
from a place of vengeance. It is not.

THIS IS ABOUT EDUCATION FIRST AND FOREMOST, and standing up for those who are, 
unknowingly, being taken advantage of. The byproduct of providing this education will be 
allowing consumers to make an informed decision and if that hurts the sales of 
unscrupulous sellers, then so be it. 

Ann has just echoed some of my remarks in earlier posts in support of sellers rights to 
take advantage of the market ... that some people may find it's worth it to pay more to 
someone to receive a previously hacked unit. 

I would venture to guess, this educational information will A) help prevent those who are 
capable of doing the hack themselves from being duped, and B) force sellers who do offer 
pre-hacked units to do so for a more 'reasonable' fee. 

This is neither spiteful nor aggressive, and it's certainly not any kind of vengeance driven 
on my part. It's standing up for the uninformed, leveling the playing field for sellers, and 
it's bringing more people the knowledge that doing 'box' research is not an exclusive club 
that only the rich can take part in (and given the pricing on the bids for these units, 
people are under the false assumption that you have a pay a high price to get your hands 
on a limited resource, when that simply is not the case.)

I can see nothing but positive benefits coming from educating people about their options.
