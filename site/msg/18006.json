Using a test  =\r\ntarget is one way of \nestablishing a \ntruth in time, which is the basis of =\r\nthis experiment.  But there are a \ncouple of issues.\n \nIt is quite possible=\r\n that someone could discern the  target through remote \nviewing alone.\nThis=\r\n would negate the need for involvement of a  spirit communicator or \ndiscar=\r\nnate entity.\nOutcomes depend on the word of those reporting.  The true skep=\r\ntic (not \ncynic) would \ntherefore say that this experiment contains a basic=\r\n  flaw in that it does \nnot uniquely \nindicate that the information was obt=\r\nained in the  prescribed manner. \nProviding access\nto the raw audio file wo=\r\nuld not necessarily  constitute proof either, since \nmany of these \ncommuni=\r\ncations can only be heard by certain people,  \n\nIf the audio file were quit=\r\ne clear,  timing  becomes an issue. In other \nwords, when  was \nthe audio a=\r\nctually recorded?  This issue can be  mitigated simply by \nrequiring any\ncl=\r\naimant to email the audio file to a trusted party  before the test ends. \nI=\r\nt would be best \nif the trusted party were not otherwise involved in  the e=\r\nxperiment and it \nwas  their duty \nsimply to collect the claims. Once all c=\r\nlaims  had been collected they \ncould be posted \npublicly for review by the=\r\n community in  general.  The experimenter could \ndecide if any \nof the clai=\r\nms seemed to have hit, and this  decision could be reviewed by \nanyone if d=\r\nesired. \n \nThe important detail however is that this experiment  does not c=\r\nompletely \nanswer the \nquestion. It is a first attempt and certainly can be=\r\n  improved on \nsuccessive trials.\n \nSuccessive trials are always a good ide=\r\na, since it  provides replication. \nAnd it would be\nbest if others replicat=\r\ned the experiment using a very  similar protocol. If \nthese were to\nsucceed=\r\n, the community could then state that out of X  trials Y had \nsucceeded (by=\r\n \nsome definition of success) potentially giving a  success rate above that=\r\n \nexpected \nby random chance. This would make the outcome  quantifiable and=\r\n measureable \nand thus meaningful.\n \nBut also important to note, this would=\r\n only prove the  potential veracity \nof the messages.\nIt would not (and can=\r\nnot as far as I can tell) prove  the origin of the \nmessages. This detail\nw=\r\nill, I fear, remain a matter for belief and  speculation for quite some \nti=\r\nme to come.\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--part1_823e2.59ca710f.396b561f_boundary\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Language: en\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3DUTF-8&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Type&gt;\n&lt;M=\r\nETA name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18928&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot; id=3Drole_body   b=\r\nottomMargin=3D7 leftMargin=3D7 rightMargin=3D7 topMargin=3D7&gt;&lt;FONT id=3Drol=\r\ne_document   color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;You mean some big =\r\nbusiness does, wait until ATT or Verison knows this is \nthe real deal, can =\r\nyou imagine ?&nbsp; The cost to talk with a loved one?&nbsp; \nIt would ruin=\r\n what we all have right now.&nbsp; Of course with all their \nmillions, they=\r\n could afford to spend the money building the perfect tele to the \nso calle=\r\nd dead.&nbsp; sf&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In a message dated 7/11=\r\n/2010 1:00:36 P.M.

Providing acces=\r\ns&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;to the raw audio file would not necessar=\r\nily \n                      constitute proof either, since many of these &lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;communications can only be heard by certain =\r\npeople, \n                      &lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;If the audio file were quite clear, \n        =\r\n              timing&nbsp;&nbsp;becomes an issue. In other words, when \n   =\r\n                   was &lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;the audio actually=\r\n recorded?&nbsp; This issue can be \n                      mitigated simply =\r\nby requiring any&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;claimant to email the aud=\r\nio file to a trusted party \n                      before the test ends. It =\r\nwould be best &lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;if the trusted party were n=\r\not otherwise involved in \n                      the experiment and it was&n=\r\nbsp; their duty &lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;simply to&nbsp;collect th=\r\ne claims. Once all claims \n                      had been collected they co=\r\nuld be posted &lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;publicly for review&nbsp;by=\r\n the community in \n                      general.&nbsp; The experimenter co=\r\nuld decide if any &lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;of the claims seemed to=\r\n have hit,&nbsp;and this \n                      decision could be reviewed =\r\nby anyone if desired. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      =\r\n                &lt;DIV&gt;The important detail however is that this experiment \n=\r\n                      does not completely answer the &lt;/DIV&gt;\n               =\r\n       &lt;DIV&gt;question. It is a first attempt and certainly can be \n         =\r\n             improved on successive trials.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;Successive trials are always a go=\r\nod idea, since it \n                      provides replication. And it would=\r\n be&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;best if others replicated the experime=\r\nnt using a very \n                      similar protocol. If these were to&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;succeed, the community could then state tha=\r\nt out of X \n                      trials Y had succeeded (by &lt;/DIV&gt;\n       =\r\n               &lt;DIV&gt;some definition of success) potentially&nbsp;giving a \n=\r\n                      success rate above that expected &lt;/DIV&gt;\n             =\r\n         &lt;DIV&gt;by random chance. This would make the outcome \n              =\r\n        quantifiable and measureable &lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;and =\r\nthus meaningful.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            =\r\n          &lt;DIV&gt;But also important to note, this would only prove the \n     =\r\n                 potential veracity of the messages.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                =\r\n      &lt;DIV&gt;It would not (and cannot as far as I can tell) prove \n          =\r\n            the origin of the messages.
