From nobody or no number said which is weird in itself because it always says what number called at the start of voice messages or will say if its unlisted/blocked. I posted some results from that on my esnips.\n\nAt first I thought somebody sat on thier phone and didnt know it dialed me but only a couple people had that phone number because I dont use my cell much. The recording went on and on and I used alot of my minutes just listening trying to make out who it was that had called. the more I listened the more I realized there were a few voices and evp on there so I transferred it to my pc and analyzed it. \n\nMisty\n\n\n--- On Fri, 10/31/08, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Unusual EVP\n&gt; To: &quot;Group&quot; &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Friday, October 31, 2008, 11:15 AM\n&gt; Has anyone here ever had a ghost/spirit/whatever leave a\n&gt; message on an \n&gt; answering machine?\n&gt; \n&gt; This is one of the freakiest things I&#39;ve ver heard!\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack"}
