You&#39;ll notice that most of the &quot;cans&quot; standing up on the board \non the right, are missing from the one on the left. The caps were replaced \nwith the little flat surface mount tantalum capacitors used in computers. \nThe tantalum caps are the tiny yellow blocks that you might be able to see \non the left hand board.  I found an easy method of adapting the surface \nmount caps to perf board, allowing me to experiment with these smaller, \nbetter components.  BTW, these represent two weeks work. The board with the \nblack heats sinks next to the counter is the charger to for the batteries. \nThe other board that&#39;s belly up I&#39;m pulling sockets from for re-use. Then, \nin the background are echo boxes, on top is an aluminum foil box, and the \nbottom one is a wave guide type box.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nCheck out all that glitters with the MSN Entertainment Guide to the Academy \nAwardsï¿½   http://movies.msn.com/movies/oscars2007/?icid=ncoscartagline2\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_7982_2fbb_699f\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;boards020707.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;boards020707.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_7982_2fbb_699f--"}
