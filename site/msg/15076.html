=A0
A mistake th=
at a lot of people make is thinking that there are two different types of e=
nergy at work when it comes to sound waves and electromagnetic waves. The o=
nly thing that seperates them is frequency and power. Radio waves are radio=
 waves because they occupy a certain block of the electromagnietic spectrum=
. Sound waves exist on that same spectrum just farther down with much longe=
r waves. Soundwaves and subsonic waves can penetrate almost anything becaus=
e of their wavelengths. The shorter the wavelength the more ways we can shi=
eld against them.
=A0
Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio a=
nd telemetry transmitting wave but the waves also have a physical effect on=
 our environment by causing molecules to speed up, which creates heat. A li=
ttle lower than this is IR or infrared it too can cause physical objects to=
 heat up but usually it just causes molecules to rotate in place. All physi=
cal things give off IR light. Its a way the total system conserves energy b=
y spontaneously emitting IR radiation.

Here is some food for thought. I am currently reviewin=

=A0
It was me and another girl =

l voice recorder that I carry with me. We were standing right next to anoth=
er digital video recorder that I leave beside my night vision camera. That =
recorder did not pick up this 3rd voice. I have asked the girl that was wit=
h me to check her recording to see if she picked it up.
=A0
I have long fel=
t the true EVP does not come from sound waves in the environment, or then i=
t wouldn't be EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow EVP's are appearing dir=
ectly on the recordings.
=A0
This instance with the recorders may back that=
 theory up. That other recorder should have picked that voice up if it were=
 sound waves in the environment.
=A0
I am attaching the clip of this 3rd vo=
ice. The=A0file that is named=A0"01-02-17 Clip" is the full clip.=A0You wil=
l hear my voice as I say "Yeah", and then another comes in right after that=
. I think I know what it says.
=A0
Again, I was live monitoring my audio, b=

I h=
ave a running theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodula=
ted exactly where they want it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne pri=
nciple. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequenc=
y then if you add or subtract them together you get a beat frequency or alt=
ernate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and =
you have an electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KH=
z then you will have a intermediate difference=A0frequency at 9KHz, well wi=
thin human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all=
 electronic equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turning them on.=
 From this theory I always felt that EVP were generated within a few inches=
 of the recorder.
=A0
We are able to reproduce this affect in not only radi=
o with superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and audio as in some=
 passive sonars and a commercial produce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr=
. Joseph Pompeii.

<DIV>A mistake that a lot of people make is t=
hinking that there are two different types of energy at work when it comes =
to sound waves and electromagnetic waves. The only thing that seperates the=
m is frequency and power. Radio waves are radio waves because they occupy a=
 certain block of the electromagnietic spectrum. Sound waves exist on that =
same spectrum just farther down with much longer waves. Soundwaves and subs=
onic waves can penetrate almost anything because of their wavelengths. The =
shorter the wavelength the more ways we can shield against them.</DIV>
<DIV=
> </DIV>
<DIV>Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and =
telemetry transmitting wave but the waves also have a physical effect on ou=
r environment by causing molecules to speed up, which creates heat. A littl=
e lower than this is IR or infrared it too can cause physical objects to he=
at up but usually it just causes molecules to rotate in place. All physical=
 things give off IR light. Its a way the total system conserves energy by s=
pontaneously emitting IR radiation.</DIV>

<DIV>I have a running theory that EV=
P is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want =
it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultra=
sonic waves that differ one another in frequency then if you add or subtrac=
t them together you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For exampl=
e, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in =
a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a inter=
mediate difference frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range =
(20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic equipment gen=
erates ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From this theory I alway=
s felt that EVP were generated within a few inches of the recorder.</DIV>
<=
DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>We are able to reproduce this affect in not only radi=
o with superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and audio as in some=
 passive sonars and a commercial produce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr=
. Joseph Pompeii.</DIV>
