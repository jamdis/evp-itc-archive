t and 2 investigations also. Nice to meet ya. From where do you hail? When =
did you first learn you could sense things others could not? BTW I'm not an=
ti mediums...just those on TV. We have been using a Ovilus in a few of our =
cases....mixed results.

I agree, Larry! (and I am a psychic, lol)
  I did not watch the show becaus=

  I find most paranormal shows have become=

    Subject: [EVP-ITC] Door =
To The Dead



    I have to admit that I thought I had seen the worst 'par=
anormal' show on television already. I was wrong. Door to the Dead has exce=
eded my worst expectations.

    Generally, I respect John Oliver's work as=
 a medium. While I have no personal experience with him, in the past he has=
 looked and acted more genuine than not, the rolling of the eyes put aside =
for the moment.

    I do take exception to the characterization of the tal=
king box as an Edison device. I have documented the history of Edison, ITC =
and EVP  elsewhere. This is however the smallest concern I have with this s=
how.

    Prior to wathcing I had just had a conversation with a respected =
colleague on the West coast regarding interesting phenomena he and others a=
re constantly observing in sites with phenomena similar to that on Door to =
the Dead. None of those measurements were made by this team. The use of the=
rmal in this situation is not indicated as well.

    The real concern is t=
hat no attempt was made to help this family in a broader context. The skept=
ic did and said nothing skeptical as far as I could tell. Key questions wer=
e not asked (at least on-camera) that would reveal the psycho-dynamics of t=
his family. We know fairly well at this time that PK phenomena is often cen=
tered on a focal person who can exhibit specific characteristics. That the =
team seems unaware of this is quite disturbing to a person like myself.

  =
  A real research opportunity was lost in this case, as was an opportunity =
to educate the public on the right way to approach such situations. Continu=
ally sending the messages that phenomena is based on 'demons' and 'spirits'=
 exclusively does nothing to further the position of serious investigators,=
 which is perhaps most troubling of all.
