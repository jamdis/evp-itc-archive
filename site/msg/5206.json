I did manage to get more signals on my radio than I thought possible but I had to stand out near a mosquito infested area at night where there was a metal frame structure that seemed to help bring signals to me.  If anyone on the other side responds it will probably be all chuckles and laughs when they see what I am doing.\n  I got about five good bites---mosquitos.  I would like to send you a one minute raw audio copy of what I recorded.  I can&#39;t really make out any responses but I thought maybe you can tell if the signal quality seems o.k. to your ears.  Would you be able to listen and give me your opinion?
