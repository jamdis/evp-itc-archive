<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce,

I think the back can remain clipped on (but I must admit, I had the 
entire thing tore down to a mess - LOL), and just do the whole hack 
through the front.  I will post a couple picks of me doing it on 
here. I will create a new folder entitled RS 20-125 Hack.  That way 
we can add to it to help others.

&gt; LC,
&gt;  
&gt; all good advice I don&#x27;t think you can take the front cover off 
without removing the back.
&gt; But then I did not try that.
&gt;  
&gt; I think the box should be RSbox 125 the others were not named for 
the original RS
&gt; hack inventor, and this 125 is the same hack only a different 
model, not a new type of box.
&gt;  
&gt; But hey who am I to say. I&#x27;m just glad someone figured out a 
reliable easy to get version.

&gt; 
&gt; RS 20125 Hack:Bruce,Yes, I just finished hacking one, too. It 
definitely is harder. The biggest thing I can recommend is to not 
remove the bottom board. If you can tear only the front section of 
the radio and keep the bottom intact, you will fare better. Simply 
undo the top little board that has the LCD window (4 clips), flip it 
back, and punch out the 7th wire from the right. A Bruce mentioned, 
you will need to be careful with the two little buttons up top for 
the light and SW button (that you don&#x27;t need). You may be able to 
hold them in place with a toothpick for each one when you pop the 
board up. If you lose them in the radio, don&#x27;t worry about it. Let it 
go and re-assemble. The radio will work just fine for you.As Steve 
mentioned earlier, the shortwave sweeps slow, unless you hold it in. 
The AM and FM sweep like the RS12-470 (older version). Clean sweep - 
nice unit. If I get some time, I took some pictures of what it looks 
like opened up. I can post them on here for you to see. Are we gonna&#x27; 
call this &quot;Steve&#x27;s Box,&quot; or the RS Hack 20125? LOL! ;)

Hey guy&#x27;s &gt; &gt; I just got done hacking the new box Steve H. has 
found.&gt; It works fine on all bands. It is a little tougher to modify 
than a &gt; 469 or 470 in the fact that it is harder to disassemble but 
with a &gt; little patience you will have a nice little box.&gt; &gt; It 
sweeps smoothly and has a telescopic antenna attached, runs on 3 AA&gt; 
batteries or an AC adapter, the adapter is not supplied with the &gt; 
radio but can be purchased at radio shack.&gt; &gt; I have not done a 
session with it as I only finished the hack about 5 &gt; minutes ago, 
but everything is working fine and it is sweeping nicely.&gt; &gt; 
something to beware of, when you remove the second board you release 
&gt; two small plastic buttons that are for changing the sw band and the 
&gt; lcd light they can fall out of the radio and are not so easy to &gt; 
replace so be careful of that.&gt; &gt; Both back and front covers remove, 
the front cover will come loose &gt; after removing the second board and 
you will see the speaker. You &gt; must carefully turn the second board 
over and you will see a grey &gt; ribbon wire, the individual wires are 
attached by an 1/8 inch of &gt; plastic on either side of each wire. The 
wire that you must clip is &gt; the mute wire, It is the 7th wire from 
the top.&gt; &gt; Cut the plastic attaching the wires together with an 
exacto knife or &gt; razor blade, just enough to get a small pair of 
scissors in to snip &gt; the correct wire. I like to not only snip the 
wire but snip out about &gt; an 1/8 of an inch segment of the wire so 
that the cut ends do not &gt; accidentally touch to make a connection 
when the box is reassembled.&gt; &gt; The modification is by no means hard 
it is just have to be a bit more &gt; attentive than when you modify a 
469 or 470.&gt; &gt; Anyone that feels they will have a problem you can 
skype me under&gt; Bruce Halliday and I will be glad to talk you through 
it.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt;
