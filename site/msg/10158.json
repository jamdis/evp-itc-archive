Perhaps some former ham operators &quot;over there&quot; are\nable to use it... :)\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n\n&gt; Here&#39;s the program if anybody wants to play around with it.  It also \n&gt; picks up stuff without playing the file through evpmaker and converts \n&gt; it into letters just by using the microphone on the computer.  I&#39;m \n&gt; going to try and figure this out later, you can also cancel out \n&gt; certain frequencies too.  It&#39;s worth exploring into this a bit.  For \n&gt; those who don&#39;t get what i&#39;m trying to do, i&#39;m running my frequency \n&gt; file through evpmaker and it than sounds like morse code.  Than i&#39;m \n&gt; using a program to try and convert the jumbled morse code sounding \n&gt; file from evpmaker into coherent messages typed on the computer \n&gt; screen.\n\n  \n&gt; The program is called Cwget.  I grew up on Ham Radio, so this doesn&#39;t \n&gt; sound so far fetched for me.  But sorry if i&#39;m losing some people on \n&gt; this method.\n\n&gt; 73&#39;s\n&gt; -Steve H.\n\n&gt; p.s.  The program was too large for yahoo, so here&#39;s a link:\n\n&gt; http://www.dxsoft.com/micwget.htm\n\n\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links"}
