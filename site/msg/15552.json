The only reason \nI came\n&gt; back was because I did not have Frank&#39;s address, now I do, so If I get\n&gt; kicked off this list by anyone, so be it, but the reason I did come\nback was\n&gt; because Spirit were giving me Frank&#39;s full name I thought it might be\nsomeone\n&gt; he  knew asking for him.

I also stated I&#39;m no engineer, and it takes me a long\ntime\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; figure this stuff out, and it seems, few if anyone else can get \nthis\n&gt; stuff\n&gt; &gt; to work at all. I don&#39;t sell the stuff, no one is out  money, except\nfor\n&gt; &gt; postage. I made no claims about how great my boxes  are.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Haliday cuts and pastes words together to form  impressive sounding\n&gt; &gt; messages, then proclaims how great he is, and  that&#39;s all this crap\nis,\n&gt; &gt; cutting someone else down for his own  benifit. The guy produces\nnothing\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; his own, and can&#39;t even spell  radio, let alone make one! How dare\nyou\n&gt; &gt; (hiliday) cut me down!? Talk  about friggin&#39; slander!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The world is full is these scumbags  all proclaiming how righteous,\nhow\n&gt; &gt; conservative, how--whatever, the  darkside is everywhere! But what\nreally\n&gt; &gt; makes it bad is the morons  that hang on every word from these show\n&gt; clowns!\n&gt; &gt; That &#39;s why I say I  can&#39;t really take offense, like they say,\nconsider\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; source.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So where&#39;s my incentive to continue this work?

I have had two\nFrank&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; boxes #&#39;s 12 and 29. #12  was stolen from me by a low life that took\n&gt; &gt; advantage of my generosity.  That is another story.\n&gt; &gt; I still have Frank&#39;s box #29, the reason you  never hear files from\nme\n&gt; using\n&gt; &gt; that box is because it literally  &quot;Sucks!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Most if not all Frank&#39;s boxes are inherently filled  with static\nwhite\n&gt; noise\n&gt; &gt; and that combined with a metal echo box and  noise generator make it\nvery\n&gt; &gt; difficult to hear anything let alone  communication which is\ndifficult\n&gt; enough\n&gt; &gt; to hear from a quiet box like  the 125.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank&#39;s box has seen it&#39;s day and served it&#39;s  purpose in my opinion\nit is\n&gt; &gt; antiquated and is no where near the  quality of even a small cheap\nRS\n&gt; 12-469\n&gt; &gt; as far as clarity of  communication.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank is actually using the guts from RS hacks  to build his boxes\nnow so\n&gt; why\n&gt; &gt; have a &quot;FRANKENBOX&quot; that is essentially  an RS hack with noise added\n&gt; instead\n&gt; &gt; of just buying an RS box and  getting better communication?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mind you this is only my  opinion but it is based on years of\nexperience\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; every box that is  or has been used. I currently have 14 different\nboxes\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; to mention  EVP maker and I have done extensive sessions and\nresearch with\n&gt; &gt; each  and for my money you can give me a 20-125 every time, the\nFrank&#39;s\n&gt; box\n&gt; &gt;  should be retired to the box museum where it belongs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am  the only person in this research that will come out and speak\nthe\n&gt; truth\n&gt; &gt; about the Frank&#39;s box, there are many people now that have them  and\nthe\n&gt; only\n&gt; &gt; person you will ever hear a file from is Steve Hultay and  sometimes\nFrank\n&gt; &gt; himself, and Frank&#39;s files are so rough you may hear 1  out of a\nhundred\n&gt; &gt; files the way he does due to the fact that he does  not even take\nthe\n&gt; time to\n&gt; &gt; do a proper session he just turns the box on  and records a couple\nof\n&gt; minute\n&gt; &gt; using his CELL PHONE !\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Frank has his place in RTSC history due to his ALLEGED invention\noff  the\n&gt; &gt; first ghost box and he deserves the respect for his  &quot;POSSIBLE&quot;\n&gt; &gt; accomplishment but to be revered as a god in the box field  NO not\nby me\n&gt; &gt; anyway.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I use the words &quot;ALLEGED&quot; and  &quot;POSSIBLE&quot; in terms of his being the\nfirst\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; create the ghost box due  to some recent information that has been\n&gt; brought to\n&gt; &gt; my attention that  concerns an individual that created, built and\nused A\n&gt; &gt; Radio Sweeping  Ghost Box in 1969.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am gathering information and  documentation now and will hopefully\nbe\n&gt; able\n&gt; &gt; to dispel the myth of  Frank sumption being the father of the ghost\nBox\n&gt; soon.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That  is to be continued!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All is possible,  nothing is probable\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  ------------  ----  ----\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; **************An Excellent Credit Score is 750.
