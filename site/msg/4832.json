Thanks for doin that for \nme and bruce. I am glad there is other ways that specialize in \ncommunicating with the deceased.  i have no clue why i have never \nheard of that but thanks for the heads up...tons of things everyone \nisnt aware of.. so you answered the one i wanted \nanswered .                                                            \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n             --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; That isn&#39;t his dad--it&#39;s Mike, his guide.\n&gt; \n&gt; What you&#39;re hearing are artifacts of the sound clean-up program \nthat  \n&gt; makes the voices more audible.\n&gt; \n&gt; These are not EVPs, they are realtime communication. They are \nheard  \n&gt; out loud as they happen.

Being I am not professional \nat\n&gt; &gt; e.v.p.s but yet have gone through listening to many of them from\n&gt; &gt; trustful resources, your e.v.p.s make me a bit leery. NOt trying \nto\n&gt; &gt; be rude, so dont go get all upset right off the bat. In your \ne.v.p.s,\n&gt; &gt; this one especially, alot of them sound like you, not the part \nwhere\n&gt; &gt; you asking questions, but where your dad is supposively answering\n&gt; &gt; you. NOw everyone has their own right to opinion so there is now \nneed\n&gt; &gt; to get defensive, if all is real there would be nothing to get mad\n&gt; &gt; about. I just cant help but notice how odd it is that your e.v.p.\n&gt; &gt; questions to your father, seems to answer right away when you ask \nthe\n&gt; &gt; question. Also, i notice that after you ask the question i hear\n&gt; &gt; something being turned on that has contains the answer to that\n&gt; &gt; question. Whether it be your dad or not. I feel its you that is\n&gt; &gt; answering, but let me tell you why i figure this.. and please you\n&gt; &gt; would like to defend you side of things that would be great, \nmaybe i\n&gt; &gt; would be able to change my opinion on the matter. But as of now,\n&gt; &gt; e.v.p.s are usually done on the same tape that the questions are \non,\n&gt; &gt; then in a rewind you can hear you and the e.v.p. but to me it \nsound\n&gt; &gt; like you put the e.v.p. response on another tape. i am not trying \nto\n&gt; &gt; start any kind of fight or be cruel, maybe i could learn \nsomething on\n&gt; &gt; behalf of how you do your work... thank you\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
