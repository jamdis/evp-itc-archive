It was noted by several people along the west coast of the \nUSA but not in some other locations. Schumann resonance phenomena usually \noccur along with earthquakes or other seismic events, but they could be \ncaused by other things, too.\n\nIt&#39;s been hypothesized it was either a large meteor entering earth&#39;s \natmosphere and possibly striking earth somewhere, a nuclear explosion or a \nsolar flare event.\n\nThere was a solar flare within the last couple days but the resultant \neffects here did not happen at the times the Schumann perturbations were \nnoticed.  Another idea has been brought up - the recent Chilean volcano \neruptions.\n\nMaybe we&#39;ll never know for sure ... it must not have been anything \ncatastrophic.\n\nZack\n\nOn Tue, 1 Jan 2008, juli velazquez wrote:\n\n&gt; Zack I am not aware, and don&#39;t believe I received any warnings.
