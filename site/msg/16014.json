I knew it was him, because when I asked how many people we were talking to today, the answer was, &quot;Just just talk to me!&quot;  My dad was always impatient, always interrupting people, so this was exactly what he would say.  Then he answered with his name to confirm.  When I asked if my dad&#39;s friend Gordy was there, the minute I mentioned his name, I swear I heard &quot;asshole.&quot;  It&#39;s possible my dad wasn&#39;t getting along with Gordy, because Gordy had a tendency in life to grate on my dad&#39;s nerves, so this might be something he&#39;d say.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Then I asked for him to say my mom&#39;s name, and he responded by saying her name in a way that was exactly how he used to say it when he was teasing her.  It wasn&#39;t his voice, it was radio voice, but it was the same inflection he used.  When I asked what relationship he had to us, there was a long sentence I couldn&#39;t make out, something about me growing up, and then, &quot;We know Jeffrey,&quot; which is my dead brother&#39;s name -- followed by &quot;daughter.&quot; \n&gt;      = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =      Hi there! How did you do this? What kind of recorder are you using or do you have a Frank&#39;s Box???  I&#39;d like to be able to do the same thing!!  Thanks!  =Judy=  Please tell us how & when (eve.?) you do this? It might help me!\n&gt; I asked if it was my dad, and a clear answer:  Yes, followed by two very loud, clear, &quot;I love yous.&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; But the best part was this:  I asked if he had a message for my mom (who was sitting there, too), and he said, &quot;Love you.  Don&#39;t wait for.  Me.  You will be.  Much.  Older.  I love you.  Love.  You.&quot;  How awesome is that?!!!!  \n&gt; \n&gt; If this wasn&#39;t my dad, it was certainly a kind, loving entity, that&#39;s for sure.  Just wanted to share with you all.  (Now I really need to figure out how to get these tapes into my computer!!!)\n&gt;"}
