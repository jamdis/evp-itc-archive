&gt; Robin,
&gt;  
&gt; In the evp file you posted I believe I&#x27;m hearing &quot;we want to kill 
you&quot;
&gt; please let me know if that is what you hear.
&gt;  
&gt; Robin, I am glad to hear that the protection ritual will be 
utilized by you 
&gt; in the purpose it was intended. To give any individual that wants 
to an
&gt; opportunity to use it.
&gt;  
&gt; You will find many forms of interaction on this group, running the 
gamut from total agreement 
&gt; to calm debate /discussion. To full blown arguments. 
&gt;  
&gt; That is what makes a group, If everyone followed one single 
ideology and the ideas of any single person without question
&gt; it would not be a group it would be a cult.
&gt;  
&gt; Welcome to the wonderful world of box research robin, I&#x27;m sure you 
will be a valued member and researcher in this community.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m still giving this topic a lot of thought because I absolutely 
believe in the power of prayer, the power of positivity, and the 
power of ritual.  When I first started recording EVP a couple of 
years ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when it 
happened to me I felt elated rather than frightened or distressed.  I 
will ask again:  What physical or psychic harm is a disembodied 
entity capable of doing?  Please listen to the one EVP I&#x27;ve posted on 
this board and tell me what, if anything, you hear.  I know what I 
hear, and I consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is the 
response that has created the determination in me to continue 
researching the unknown.  
&gt;  
&gt; Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings.  I only want to learn as 
much as I can from you and the other dedicated researchers on this 
board.  It never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in the 
past, and that&#x27;s about all I can say.  I will probably use one from 
this point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract 
goodness.  
&gt;  
&gt; So, thank you for this contribution.  I think the debate has been 
an excellent one, and I&#x27;ve appreciated the opportunity to be 
enlightened.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; I swore I would not get wraped up in this debateBUT!The reason I 
came up with this whole protection ritual was that some of the new 
researchers whereexpressing a rational concern for negative responces 
that they were recieving through thier boxes.The short protection 
ritual that I posted is not meant to quell irrational histerical 
fear, and I agreewith rosemary that anyone suffering from such fear 
should rethink thier involment in the paranormal research field.that 
being said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal comfort to 
those new individuals that had never expperienced spiritual 
negativity. And to help ease them into aproaching a session 
eventually with confidenceand determination as well as full 
curiousity for all types of the communication we recieve.My initial 
post of the ritual file was done with the best of intentions and 
meant to be another tool available for those who felt they needed or 
wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer ritual, I don&#x27;t 
think it is really worthy of all this debate.Use it, don&#x27;t use it. 
It&#x27;s there if you want it. Also I must say there are two kinds of 
fear the kind that is natural and a god given emotion for self 
preservation, ie the fright and flight reflex that is an instinctive 
trait in all of us. Then you have the irrational dibilitating phobic 
fear that can turn an individual into a frozen statue. That type of 
fear I believe is unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt with and 
learned how to harness. I also believe that anyone that harbors that 
type of fear would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a 
case of such fear it would already be present and doing a small 
protection ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take it for 
what it is, something to utilize in our box of tools like an emf 
meter.you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the bottom of 
your tool box at home that you inherited from your grandfather and 
have never usedbut if you come across that odd nut that needs 
tightening somedsy you will be glad you have it.Bruce
