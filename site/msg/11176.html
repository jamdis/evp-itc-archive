I think its a bit of both actually. There are many methods, many tools, and I would say the ghost box devices are a great tool to use.

Heres one I recorded recently doing sweep tuning on my fm card. Kind of pertains to this conversation and I was just sharing it with a friend. Attaching it to this post its too long of a filename wise to post here in file section. I might upload it to my esnips for those who dont get individual emails.

&gt; Hi Misty,
&gt; Thank you for your suggestions...I would never have thought
&gt; of that on my own! That would reduce all of the &quot;ghost
&gt; phones&quot; to simply being tools rather than devices to
&gt; communicate with a spirit.
&gt; There is a small group of us (paranormal investigators) in
&gt; Muskegon, MI. We have had some interesting success with
&gt; photographs. In a month I am taking them in an entirely new
&gt; direction: using your body as a tool for ghost hunting. And
&gt; not for protection, either! LOL. 
&gt; This would fit right in with this idea of using some sort
&gt; of white noise...even in the field.Or at least, it will
&gt; give them something to really chew on!

&gt; Hi Misty
&gt; 
&gt; You&#x27;re the only person I&#x27;ve heard mention this, and
&gt; it makes me feel better knowing I&#x27;m not crazy (at keast
&gt; totally). lol Long ago I noticed that running tap water
&gt; sometimes seems to sound like garbled speech. I never
&gt; tested this with a recorder, but I&#x27;ve caught some evps
&gt; with refrigerator motors and other devices. Audacity has
&gt; the &quot;add white noise&quot; option, which allows you to
&gt; record directly to your computer and allow the entities to
&gt; organize the generic white noise. I&#x27;m eager to try
&gt; that. An excellent observation you had, Misty. I think they
&gt; must grab hold of any babbling or whirring noise available
&gt; to communicate, whether we&#x27;re able to pick it up or
&gt; not. That&#x27;s why I carry around one of the lightweight
&gt; Olympus recorders -- no telling where you&#x27;re going to
&gt; find a babbling-brook or steady motor sound. Good ear!

&gt; 
&gt; Sweep tuning can be used on AM FM shortwave etc. I have had
&gt; some 
&gt; success without tuning just allowing them to use the static
&gt; or water 
&gt; noise thats in background. Best advice one cold give is try
&gt; it 
&gt; yourself for a while and see what you come up with =)

&gt; &gt; Why do you need to &quot;sweep&quot; the AM spectrum? 
&gt; &gt; Has anyone tried this but without sweeps on the
&gt; shortwave band? Has 
&gt; any research been done? Could it be that the AM band has
&gt; some sort 
&gt; of &quot;special properties&quot; that would allow such
&gt; communication? 
&gt; &gt; Why is it that the AM band has to be used with a radio
&gt; station 
&gt; playing? There are parts of the spectrum that is just
&gt; outside of that 
&gt; spectrum that might provide a better form of communication.
