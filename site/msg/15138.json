The reason we were able to do this was that the client clai=\r\nmed she could see them with her eyes and then she would take a picture and =\r\nsure enough-she would get orbs.\n\n  These orbs looked exactly like your ever=\r\nyday dust orb. While we were conducting the investigation, we had her tell =\r\nus where to take a photo and we would take a picture. Sure enough WITHOUT f=\r\nail, we would get orbs right where she pointed them out to us. We could not=\r\n se them with our eyes, but she could.\n\n  Now in our other photos -nothing.=\r\n We didn&#39;t get any orbs at all until she was around.\n\n  At the time, we had=\r\n 3 investigators using 3 different types of cameras - a film camera, a low =\r\nend digital and a high end digital. All 3 were picking up these orbs on que=\r\nue.\n\n  We had no choice but to consider these orbs as something other than =\r\ndust.\n\n  Still though, we could not say they were ghosts.
