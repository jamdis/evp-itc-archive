<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just a little friendly reminder that you all need to organize your 
files better in the files area. Space is limited here and you are all 
nearing the 100% mark so try to keep your section under 5 megs. If 
you need more space use www.esnips.com and you can store 50 gigs to 
share with the group or public.

I think it is great you guys have so much to share I just wish that 
our yahoo group wasnt so limited on space (and that I wasnt so 
limited on time). But I have found a way around it. If just a few 
people signed up and shared using esnips they can invite others to 
visit thier files and once they do they also get 50 gigs of free 
space for audio pictures or video or whatever you want to post.

I was considering setting up one &quot;group&quot; account to start with and 
inviting all members who post files to join it and be able to post to 
the account. It will automatically notify everyone thats a member 
when a file is added to it just like the yahoo group does. It also 
allows you to share with the public or privately if you so choose. 
You can even allow your friends to post to your account if you wish.

This group has grown and expanded and we just need to make a few 
changes to how we do things to keep it running more smoothly for the 
future. I am hoping that you all will help me in this endeavor. I 
know many of you have already adapted the idea to help us organize 
and maintain the group.

I want you to keep sharing and to be able to share more! 

So please organize and not post stray files that are targets for 
deletion once the que is 100% full. And for your own sake, if no one 
elses, be respectful to each other.
