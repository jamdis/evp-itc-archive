Frank, I think you are right in that the reason for the negativity and sens=
ationalism in these shows is that it sells better.=A0 Most people watch the=
se shows for the escape and entertainment value, like the rest of tv.=A0=A0=
 And these shows learn over time what loses audience (same old claims, bori=
ng results, etc), and what draws them back (wild claims, overall freak valu=
e, and "we must protect the children!").=A0 This is all completely orthodox=
 for tv entertainment, but does lend itself to any kind of true research, o=
r any kind of actual edification.

So I think we can expect these shows wil=
l continue to ramp these sorts of elements up in order to compete, and we c=
an expect them to dwell less on mundane and activity-free situations, and p=
resent more claims of evil entities, mysterious injuries, and unexplainable=
 foul odors, accompanied by more frightened investigators, trembling sensit=
ives, and humorously gullible associates and customers, and all wrapped in =
fancier technology, scarier settings, and state-o-the-art editing.

That is an interesting obser=
vation. I think the core of the issue is that there seems to be a `sweet sp=
ot' in paranormal beliefs where there is just enough science, just enough t=
echnical backing, just enough paranormal claims, and just enough indefinite=
 evidence that keeps people interested in the ghost hunting mentality


Evi=
dence which becomes too indefinite turns off most people. As they become mo=
re aware of sensitives who simply make claims ("I feel there is a GHOST her=
e!"), but provide no evidence other than statements, people eventually get =
bored. Similarly, people eventually grow tired of the anthropomorphism of e=
very little occurrence in a house: a creak implies a footstep, which implie=
s a person, which, if not seen, implies a ghost. But a creak does not equal=
 a footstep.


And while this kind of indefinite evidence can lose an audie=
nce, so can evidence that is claimed to be "obviously" evident by technolog=
y. Here, the investigator is no longer making vague claims, but waving scie=
nce around, like FLIR cameras, or EMF meters, and then making proclamations=
 of the results. But again, people eventually see these are just lights and=
 sounds from electronics, and investigators making more claims. It's like t=
he psychics again, but with visual aids.


I think the reason EVP studies a=
re not securing more interest, as you noted, are a little of both effects. =
First is the anthropomorphism problem: I notice many EVP experimenters proc=
laim what their results sound like, or name the sound file by what they've =
heard. But like the creaks, "sounds like" does not equal "is". This is then=
 compounded by the technology backing: regardless of how valid the EVP rese=
archer's results are, the technology can seem intimidating, but the researc=
hers often proclaim the obviousness of their results. People again become t=
urned off by it because it is not obvious to them, and in the end it is jus=
t another piece of technology presenting sounds, with no obvious connection=
 to the paranormal, except by the claims and interpretations of the present=
ers.


I believe, taking these issues into account, there is a way for EVP =
studies to garner more interest. For now, the analysis coming from the rese=
archers usually seems like a claim, and it is these claims, imho, that is b=
eing classified by the public with the rest of the paranormal claims, and s=
o, it also becomes less of an interest. A new approach could be one without=
 the claims and interpretations of the investigators, one where the sounds =
are simply played and not labeled. The interpretation of the data could be =
left to the listeners. Web sites which present EVPs could be developed wher=
e people could not see others interpretations until they entered their own.=
 I think this would be such a novel approach, that it would give the public=
 a better feeling of true involvement in the research, and feel less like t=
hey are simply being exposed to the claims of others. And I think that feel=
ing of involvement is what is needed to reignited the public interest here.=
