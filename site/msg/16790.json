I am interested in creating a Franks Box from the radio shack radio. (I&#39;m not mechanically inclined) I apologize but I couldn&#39;t find the directions anywhere. Can someone point me in the right direction to create my own ghost box? \n&gt; I am also interested in the quality of sound some of you may have gotten with digital tape recorder EVPs.  I got one that happened when I left the recorder in my living room and left. It sounded like the voice was spinning around the room (kind of like Carol Ann in Poltergiest) and it said &quot;Door is open&quot;  Is it odd to hear a voice that sounds like it is spinning as it speaks?\n&gt; Thanks &#39;\n&gt; Angelina \n&gt; Atlanta\n&gt;\nhttp://www.keyportparanormal.com/ Almost all you need is in here."}
