<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I know this was addressed to Ann, but having had 2 NDE&#x27;s and knowing  
many who have, I don&#x27;t know a soul who has experienced anything  
negative, though I&#x27;ve read biased religious reports of people  
experiencing &quot;hell&quot; - something I don&#x27;t believe in, nor know anyone  
who has in the vast amount of NDE&#x27;ers I&#x27;ve talked to.

I think it&#x27;s important to focus on the majority of positive  
experiences. I&#x27;m not sure why people seem to feed or insist on  
negative experiences.

First off, the Fish Group aren&#x27;t &quot;people&quot;. They are not and haven&#x27;t  
ever been human. I have no idea where you get this idea.
They are, in fact, a group. There is more than one.
Lastly, we can&#x27;t know where or what they experience and to date, those  
who have had experiences with them have found that they appear quite  
happy doing exactly what they&#x27;re doing. I wish you luck if you want to  
pursue &quot;helping&quot; them. You&#x27;ll need it.

Not all energies we record are human. This is an important fact.

As far as the Fish Group being mobile, they most certainly are. They  
are highly intelligent and more than capable of going to &quot;the Light&quot;  
or anywhere else they wish.

What you state about Gettysburg is your opinion and many would beg to  
differ with your opinion. It&#x27;s important I have found to keep the mind  
open - very open in this line of research. After many years of  
research, a few try to label and make claims, but there isn&#x27;t much to  
support their claims

&gt;
&gt; i am not saying that the &quot;fish people&quot; are a negative entity. Not at  
&gt; all. They are most likely an entity who is isolated and alone. They  
&gt; are an entity who very well may have a lower vibration that can  
&gt; prevent them from moving towards the light. In fact, on their level,  
&gt; there is no sense of light at all. Most of the earth bounds are  
&gt; actually spirits who are in basically a mono-dimensional universe.  
&gt; In a  singular dimension. Their own dimension. In fact, until  
&gt; spiritual assistance is offered from both sides of the veil, they  
&gt; will remain trapped. They know no dimension, nor depth, height,  
&gt; width, breadth or even light. Some are trapped in either total  
&gt; darkness or trapped in a form of mist or fog.
&gt;
&gt; You might be interested in listening to some tapes that have been  
&gt; made of trance mediums who have assisted with their rescue.  If you  
&gt; are, let me know and I will send you the URL.
&gt;
&gt; What you are referring to about Gettysburg are NOT psychic  
&gt; impressions. Impressions is when a traumatic event took place and  
&gt; the event will replay over and over again. in fact, in some cases,  
&gt; the event can even be timed.
