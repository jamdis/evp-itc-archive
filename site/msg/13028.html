Hi everyone, I have recorded a video of my EVP-Radio Crim=
e recording 
process, where I get leads from deceased victims and hand over=
 to law 
enforcement or missing person advocates to run the leads.

http://=
uk.youtube. com/watch? v=3DWhGKXBp6Lg0

I went out to Mike Colletta's site =
to see if there was any guidance, 
but none on how to sync up my voice in t=
he video.

I used a web cam to do the recording.

Does anyone know how to d=
o this?

Mike Edwards
