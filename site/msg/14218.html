There are general set of 10 codes that recommended and published for people listing to emergency services radio bands as a go by.  Many departments customize the 10 codes for their department, so from location to location the codes don't always mean the same thing.  When multiple departments are working together Home Land Security recommends that to eliminate possible misunderstandings, 10 codes should not be used.

Code 7 is either code for being out of service (short for 10-7), or a meal break:

Tonight at work I was talking to a state trooper, there had been an accident. I asked him if there were any deaths (it was very very bad) and he said he didnt know so he got on his radio and called in and asked them if it was a 7 at the site. They told him negative, and he told me the little boy who was the worst off was still alive. I asked him why did you ask them if it was a 7. He said code 7, I was asking them if they were dead. So if you ever hear anyone call 7 over the radio that means someones dead.
 
Just thought I would pass that on. I find it interesting since I know alot of us have heard this before when used to describe who is speaking rather than a name they say seven.
