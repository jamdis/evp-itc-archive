It sounds like some sort of\nresonance being set up in the echo chamber by something in the noise\nfrom the radio. Sort of an audio oscillation.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn 11/7/10, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  Not sure what this flute sound is. The sweep hung up, and put AM reception\n&gt; down below the band--I think. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s a weird feedback signal, as\n&gt; it was only audible in the echo chamber. Could it be an amazing example of\n&gt; spirit communication, naw, I think it much more mundane. It was after I put\n&gt; the top cover on, so my vote is feedback notes.\n&gt;\n&gt;  This is not intended to reflect on any other systems out there, real or\n&gt; imagined, only my own work is in question.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
