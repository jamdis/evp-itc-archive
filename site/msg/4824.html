<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m actually working on an iPod Shuffle design.  Using the shuffle
also down on power consumption for me as well.  Basically using 
evpmaker to chop up a supplied voice file, I did a straight loop back
in to the computer to record it (i.e. not through the speakers, so
there&#x27;s no contamination of the sound file with outside noise or
unwanted evp).  After creating an hour long file recording, I loaded
this on the shuffle, then amplify it through the box.  As a
researcher, my concern in the past had been regarding some complaints
people had - that because you&#x27;re pulling in radio signals you have no
ability to provide a control subject.  I.e. no way to tell what was on
a station at a certain time that you could be tuning in on, so you can
discount it from the proposed evp reception.  I&#x27;m trying to solve that
by providing a known sound file that can be compared and contrasted
against.

My question to people, is what design are people using for the chamber
of the box itself?  I.e. what baffling construction, etc.  Have you
found a specific design and/or specific materials to be more effective
than others?

&gt; Hey Deb,
&gt;  
&gt; What I think you should be experimenting with a radio shack hack.
&gt; you can pick up a 12-469 at radio shack for 24.99 and you will be able
&gt; to start doing box research as opposed to traditional evp .
