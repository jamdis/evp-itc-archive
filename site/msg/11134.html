Hi all,



      My name is D. Charles, and I belong to a group here in Io=
wa called
IPART, (formerly DIEPART)  http://www.diepart.com/
<http://www.di=
epart.com/>   The group has been around for many years,
but I've only been =
a member for a year. I'm currently doing research on
this "Frank's Box". Se=
veral people in my group know about it, but
"officially" we as a group do n=
ot 'conjur' due to the fact that no one
really knows who they are actually =
contacting from beyond the grave, and
an invitation to an 'evil' spirit can=
 cause serious problems. Problems
that have been encountered by a few membe=
rs of our group who have been
followed home by something evil.

      I ser=
iously would like to learn all I can about this box, and
possibly build one=
 for myself, just to experiment with.  I would
appreciate all the info I ca=
n get about it.



Thanks

d.Pille
