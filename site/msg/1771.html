&gt;Just make sure YOU arent paying for the website bandwith on that idea LOL. 
&gt;Sounds great though. A bit like 
&gt;http://www.dxzone.com/catalog/Internet_and_Radio/Online_Receivers/
&gt;   with all thier online radio hams broadcasting over the ineternet but 
&gt;with a franks box spin on it. In most of them multiple users can tune in at 
&gt;the same time to whats going on..its who has control of the radio that is 
&gt;the problem when diff people want to listen to diff things.
&gt;
&gt;   I say go for it, we know they can modulate the sound on each users end 
&gt;so theres no reason why people shouldnt get results and responses. Ive 
&gt;heard them use online radios for contact recently, by modulating the sound 
&gt;being broadcast. They use peoples names so there is no doubting its being 
&gt;used to communicate.

&gt;           It&#x27;s like DAH!!! Why I not think about this!? Setup an internet 
&gt;server
&gt;(somehow) and connect a box to the internet to run 24/7----LIVE. Or make
&gt;coordinated short tests so remote reception can be compared to local. It
&gt;would be an easy task to make modes and bands switchable remotely as well.
&gt;What about multiple boxes?
&gt;
&gt;Just imagine, a box accessible to the world 24 hours a day, seven days a
&gt;week! It staggers the imagination! Given the nature of the voices and
&gt;contacts, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if several people could access the system
&gt;at the exact same time, yet all receive personal communications.
&gt;
&gt;Guess that would create wee ripple in the darkside!!
&gt;
&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if the originator of the idea wanted his name out there, I
&gt;took it off.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There&#x27;s no way I can stop making boxes, I just don&#x27;t have the

&gt; &gt; &gt; make the things more better. I am no engineer, and it takes a while to

&gt; &gt;Hey Frank,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Its me again
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I haven&#x27;t had much time to work on ITC lately but I&#x27;m interested in
&gt; &gt;taking a slightly different approach using a quantum random number
&gt; &gt;generator (unless its cost prohibitive) and computer (hoping it
&gt; &gt;doesn&#x27;t get fried).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;But... what are your thoughts on this:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;What if we hooked up one of your boxes to the internet for remote
&gt; &gt;users to attempt interaction with? Leaning on the non-locality theory.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Couple things I&#x27;m wondering about, assuming it works:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- Would the box work &quot;better&quot; physically present at a &quot;high energy&quot;
&gt; &gt;location? I&#x27;m refering to locations on Earth that are known to be
&gt; &gt;high energy from lay lines, etc. &quot;portals&quot;.
&gt; &gt;- Will the recorded audio from your box be the same recorded or heard
&gt; &gt;audio at the remote location? Meaning will the EVP be recordable at
&gt; &gt;your location or only the remote users location? Or if both, will
&gt; &gt;they match?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Just some things I&#x27;ve been thinking about lately. Curious what you think.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
