I also heard someone in \nthe \n&gt; background singing &quot; Happy Birthday &quot; too. How cool is that, no \n&gt; coincidence seems like to me. Here is another story I was watching \nTV \n&gt; the Grammy Awards and when Little Richard and Jerry lee Lewis was \non \n&gt; there was another singer with them from Credence Clearwater Revival \nI \n&gt; couldn&#39;t remember his name. So as I was listening to the spirits I \n&gt; heard a voice today say &quot; John Fogerty &quot; is that his name I think \nit \n&gt; is? How cool was that ? Oh well just some stuff to ponder on. You \nall \n&gt; have a great evening.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Ralph the Ghost Hunter\n&gt;"}
