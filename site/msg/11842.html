&gt; W.,
&gt;
&gt; You can&#x27;t speak for everyone who has had an NDE. Not everyone has  
&gt; had a great experience. I am glad that you had a wonderful and  
&gt; enlightening experience. People who have had a negative NDE remember  
&gt; those experiences.
&gt;

W: Of course I can&#x27;t - and I&#x27;m not, nor have I ever.

&gt; Now about the &quot;Fish people.&quot; I never said that they were people.  
&gt; That was the term that has been bandied about and I was using the  
&gt; same language.
&gt;

&gt; W: I&#x27;ve never heard anyone prior to you use the term &quot;Fish People&quot;.  
&gt; Who, besides you, uses the term?
&gt;
&gt; If they have never been human, then what are they?
&gt;
W: Who knows? I didn&#x27;t ask. Does it matter? We aren&#x27;t the only beings  
in the great beyond Al.

&gt; &lt;&lt;They are, in fact, a group. There is more than one. Lastly, we  
&gt; can&#x27;t know where or what they experience and to date, those who have  
&gt; had experiences with them have found that they appear quite happy  
&gt; doing exactly what they&#x27;re doing.&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Right...LOL...and you know this how? Because you have listened to  
&gt; them? You have the uncanny ability to KNOW when a spirit is or is  
&gt; not happy?

W: Not sure what&#x27;s amusing, but I don&#x27;t appreciate your sarcasm. I  
know this as I&#x27;ve dealt with them personally. I guess you haven&#x27;t read  
my prior posts.

&gt;
&gt; I am not interested in helping them, per se. What I am interested  
&gt; in, is learning more about them and why they are the way that they  
&gt; are. That is normal for me since I am a medium.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt;Not all energies we record are human. This is an important fact.&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Oh? Really? What are they; or shall I ask, what WERE they? Unless  
&gt; you buy into the theory that behind every tree lurks a demon! Which  
&gt; is so full of balogney. Fallen angels maybe?

W: Full of baloney? Who do you think you are making jest of my  
experience? Who made you the authority on the Fish Group? Me? I can  
only speak from experience. At least I&#x27;ve interacted with them.

I&#x27;ve recorded many energies claiming to be elementals to extra  
terrestrials. You tell me where they are. Does it matter? Who cares  
really? Why don&#x27;t you try to contact them Al and &quot;save them&quot;. Let us  
all know what happens.

&gt;
&gt; Where did you find out about this &quot;important fact&quot;? (That they were  
&gt; never human?) I am really interested in your theory. I am being  
&gt; honest...

W: By talking to them. I spent weeks talking to them. Also via others  
who spoke with them.
&gt;
&gt; I know that some energies were never human...electricity is an  
&gt; energy and has never been human. I don&#x27;t know how something that can  
&gt; interact with the our present dimension is NOT or has never been  
&gt; alive at some point. Angels are a dynamic force and they have not  
&gt; been alive either. They interact with us, but that is pretty much it.
