<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Oh - and I tend to agree with this explanation from &quot;Skeptic&quot; 
magazine:

&quot;...Some people believe that skepticism is the rejection of new 
ideas, or worse, they confuse &quot;skeptic&quot; with &quot;cynic&quot; and think that 
skeptics are a bunch of grumpy curmudgeons unwilling to accept any 
claim that challenges the status quo. This is wrong. Skepticism is a 
provisional approach to claims. It is the application of reason to 
any and all ideas  no sacred cows allowed. In other words, 
skepticism is a method, not a position. Ideally, skeptics do not go 
into an investigation closed to the possibility that a phenomenon 
might be real or that a claim might be true. When we say we 
are &quot;skeptical,&quot; we mean that we must see compelling evidence before 
we believe...&quot;

(http://www.skeptic.com/about_us/discover_skepticism.html)

In this regard - I consider myself a skeptic...one who practices/uses 
skepticism. Note that this concept cuts both ways. For example - some 
EVP is explained away as &quot;apophenia&quot;. When you really dig into that 
term - you find that it is used inappropriately.

I&#x27;ve started calling people like James Randi, etc. &quot;discreditors&quot;. 
Not only do they NOT believe in various abilities/stories/etc. (at 
least publicly) but they ACTIVELY ridicule the people and their work 
whom they disagree with and attempt to rally others to this cause.

&gt; &gt;   It&#x27;s called &quot;Pathological Disbelief&quot;. The entire article is a 
&gt; good read but the case involving the paranormal starts on page 41. 
&gt; Here is the link. I will actually post the paper in the files 
section.
