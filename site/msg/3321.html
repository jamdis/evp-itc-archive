&gt;  At the Stanley recently I was surprised with the box use, and what 
was coming through for others. I just make the things, I don&#x27;t know 
how it works, and it appears to work differently than what I 
expected. I also prefer the users speak of what it does. However, I 
expect a reaction from those that would keep this technology a secret 
to make attempts to show that it&#x27;s only for a privliged few to use, 
and &quot;interpret&quot; for the masses. I&#x27;m getting hints of this reaction, 
and have already shown my hand as to what side I&#x27;m on. Right now it&#x27;s 
the fear of evil spirits being released as an excuse as to why the 
common person should not use this stuff. That&#x27;s same reasoning that 
keeps people away from other means of communication, like the quija 
board, channeling, dowsing, automatic writting......you name it.  No, 
you must pay a $300 an hour medium to communicate! Much money at 
stake for our insolence.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I agree. As an author, I am attacked all the time for &quot;exploiting&quot; 
Chicago&#x27;s haunted history and those who have had personal experiences 
with the paranormal phenomena at the sites about which I write. But I 
have found that it is only one&#x27;s jealous colleagues (or wanna-bes) 
who complain. Those who are honestly interested in the phenomena and 
in learning about its meaning in their lives are grateful for what 
you do.I am such a shy person, and I loathe the natural attention 
that comes from what I do. But you have a duty as a researcher to 
bring your findings to those who are interested in them. When you do, 
the jealous and the skeptical will attack you, make no bones about 
it, and (ironically) they will say first off that you are arrogant 
and self-serving, and that you love the limelight. Some people who 
love attention thrive on that negative attention; for me it&#x27;s 
torture. But I have to deal with it, and so do you!I would like very 
much to have you publicly talk about your research. What good is it 
if it doesn&#x27;t help idiots like us figure out how to do our own?:)
