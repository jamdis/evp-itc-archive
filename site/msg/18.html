&gt; Hi all;
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  I was trying to upload some of those predictions I&#x27;ve been 
getting, but
&gt; started having problems getting to yahoo. I might have to do this 
stuff
&gt; form home. 
&gt; 
&gt; It&#x27;s not that I think the predictions are absolutely true, but 
they seem
&gt; important, and it&#x27;s been my experience that when I try to judge 
what is
&gt; crap, and what&#x27;s real, I&#x27;m usually wrong. I wanted to share these 
from
&gt; my site, but there&#x27;s a weird problem with Internet Explorer, and 
ActiveX
&gt; controls that locks up people&#x27;s computers that try to hear the 
voices.
&gt; There is always a possibility that the predictions are from a fear
&gt; mongering group on the other side, but I&#x27;m not smart enough to 
figure
&gt; that out.
