<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Relax Ursula.

I too have been aware of this at Keith&#x27;s site for long, long time, but like
I said in the last post, I am very new to this as in doing it on my own
computer.  Just like you.  So don&#x27;t act like you know what I do and do not
know, thank you very much.

I am not attacking you so back the hell off.  I made it clear that this was
for my own own edification, for me to accept my own images.

The image I ever so briefly mentioned the one posted that had several
&quot;Faces&quot; or pieces thereof that were circled.  As for your image of the man
peeking out, I saw nothing there.  Period.   Did I say previously what I
thought about the quality of the images in that photo?  No.  I politely kept
it to myself because I do not like to differ with people or to deflate hot
air balloons.  But there you have it, that is what I saw.  And to my
knowledge, that is the only time I have described what I have seen thus far
in your images other than mentioning the word &quot;eyebrows.&quot;  In the one that
had many circles, I saw one that looked like a set of lips and a chin and
the rest I personally thought was matrixing.  Once again, did I saw this?
 No.  But you asked for it so there it is.

The whole point of my post, had you read it with a clear head.  It was all
about my own edification, that I, and I alone, need to keep plugging in
files before I, and I alone, make a judgement about MY images and whether
they are real or not based upon the images they provide in contrast to the
bulk of other files.  If you simply compare your one image with the many
circles to the youtube file, I suspect I am correct in saying that faces
occur with much more rarity than your circle file and that they can appear
fully formed.  Once again, I suspect, only, and I will only be able to tell
after time.  Sample size is everything, and I thought I made that abundantly
clear.  The post was simply about my process of learning rather than running
out and saying look what I found when I simply don&#x27;t know what has been
found yet because it is the first time I have played with the controls
rather than seeing the end snapshots on another persons website.

Why do you always jump on the defensive and attack every one who does not
fall in line with you?  Not everything has to be fight or flight, Ursula,
and not every bridge has to be burned so thoroughly to the ground.  This is
not an attack on you or results, reread the post, and this time thinking a
little more clearly about what is written on the page and not your own
emotional backlash construing things in the posted text that are simply not
there.  Had you done this, you would have seen the point of my post was not
an attack on you, in ANY way.

&gt;
&gt; No, I don&#x27;t think I am being too critical, but I may have expectations that
&gt; are a little too high.  I want to take my time with this.  For my own
&gt; understanding, I need to have a large sample size so I know not only what to
&gt; expect to see, but what to look for.  I have seen ITC snapshots from
&gt; programs like this that offer full faces.  I would be more inclined to
&gt; believe in such an image as opposed to, lets say. two dark lines that may or
&gt; may not be eyebrows.
&gt;
&gt; Even in your example of the towel, you get half a face.  If you have half a
&gt; face (on the vertical plane, not the horizontal) you can extrapolate out
&gt; what the entire face would look like.  This is something I would like to get
&gt; myself and I would consider that evidence if it showed up in one of these
&gt; programs.  But, if you have something that looks like a forehead and that is
&gt; all there is, then it could also look like a rock or some other such object.
&gt;
&gt; I am certainly hoping for results worked into box sessions.  Directing a
&gt; session with intent, like saying &quot;I am going to examine the sound waves of
&gt; this communication in hopes of seeing your face.  Is it possible you can
&gt; show your face to me now through sound? &quot; is what I am after.  If a positive
&gt; hit like this happens, then I will be jumping for joy.  Another good example
&gt; would be a name, lets say Tom, that occurs.  If you get a positive
&gt; affirmation that the name you heard is present, then you try the same
&gt; technique only you address Tom by name and get a face, that would be even
&gt; better.
&gt;
&gt; But, as it stands now, the faces as they appear are random at best.  I
&gt; would be more inclined to believe that when these faces do occur , they are
&gt; going to occur with a lesser frequency than multiple images in a few seconds
&gt; of audio like Ursula&#x27;s example.  If this where the case, there would be
&gt; dozens, and possibly hundreds, of faces during a ten minute session and I
&gt; just don&#x27;t think that is possible.  This is why I need to look at several
&gt; samples to find out if this is the case or not.  If these partialized faces
&gt; occur in multiples all the time, I would be more apt to discount it.  But,
&gt; if they are a rarity affixed to only a few clips out of dozens, I would be
&gt; more inclined to believe in them.  Sample size is everything.  It is like
&gt; listening to GBC.  If you have never done a session before, you would be
&gt; inclined to believe every stray radio signal is a communication.  Only by
&gt; continued practice (expanding your sample size) can you start to rule out
&gt; stray radio with any degree of accuracy.
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, I am very new to this and I could certainly be wrong.  I
&gt; will continue to plug sound into the programs and hope for the best.
&gt;
&gt; I really want this to work.  As you have probably experienced, when they
&gt; want you to hear something or know something, they make it very obvious
&gt; while communicating.  I am hoping they apply this same rigor to this new
&gt; format to show us that they are there.  If they can, then the world of video
&gt; and audio ITC will merge in one source and then the skeptics be damned!

&gt;    I think it&#x27;s unrealistic to expect every file to have faces and images.
&gt; These faces are often just portions, eyes and lips, some have eye brows.
&gt; Like all of this, not done for proof, it&#x27;s for emotional impact.  I have
&gt; this woman that shows up in towels, always just half the face. Perahps you
&gt; are being too critical? As with all spirit messages, it&#x27;s what it means to
&gt; the experiencer that matters. Expecting full faces is like expecting the
&gt; kings english and proper grammer in all EVPs.

&gt;  I saw a couple which could be construed as images in the one series you
&gt; had from SEA, but nothing that knocked me over the head yet.  I am going to
&gt; have to see a larger sample size before I determine if what you have
&gt; witnessed is in fact a form or not.  I cannot accept an image as paranormal
&gt; without knowing where it sits among the bulk of audio files.  If every file
&gt; has multiple faces, the I would have  to say that there is nothing there.
&gt;
&gt; So, I will certainly keep testing with my copy and hopefully something will
&gt; really pop for me.  I have run through about ten files (EVP and GBC) so far
&gt; for intensive study and I still haven&#x27;t got anything that I would consider a
&gt; positive hit.  I need an actual formed face, not portions thereof, to
&gt; consider an image real.  This is the only way to discount visual matrixing.
&gt;
&gt; I have high hopes for this though!

&gt;  I&#x27;ve seen live webcast of ITC sessions where GB output is fed directly
&gt; into the mic line in on a computer running Adobe Audition with the
&gt; spectragraph running. It was really compelling to see letters and numbers,
&gt; not images or pictures, but partial words appear in the graph. At first it
&gt; was I thought it was a software glitch but it is a repeatable event. It was
&gt; on LiveSciFi which is run by Tim Wood, he also thought there was some kind
&gt; of code error but it happened on more than one webcast.
&gt;
&gt; So if anyone has Audition, just feed Box output right in your computer and
&gt; see what happens. I wanted to try it tonight but I have Audacity and the
&gt; spectragraph feature doesn&#x27;t have that shaded appearance that Audition does
&gt; so it&#x27;s not able to render images or characters, at least as far as I see
&gt; using the various settings.
