<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, you&#x27;re right, what are the chances... bazillion to one is right...

Scientists have a bias against religion because they equate it with blind faith and superstition, some of them perhaps even have a vendetta against their family religion, for making them grow up with a belief system that they feel is constrictive, and as scientist adults their emotional reaction is to do whatever is in their power to bash down anything that might point to a higher power or anything that transcends the five senses... as if a higher power and religion are synonymous (which they most certainly are not, if you ask me)... the truth is hardly ever black or white... the scientific bias and the religious bias.... neither one alone will ever arrive at the truth... the truth is somewhere in the middle...

I can also understand your sentiment in which you want to say &quot;screw science&quot;, as you did below :), and it is that same frustration/resentment that some scientists have toward religion when they say &quot;screw religion&quot; and reject EVP recordings.  However, if you reject the scientific method, then you reject the other half of the truth, just like those scientists are doing.  The truth must meet in the middle.  
I too feel frustrated at how scientists manipulate the scientific method to arrive at the most &quot;convenient&quot; scientific results - often outright lies, probably, to be quite blunt.  Science is rife with corruption, as is just about every area of human endeavor where someone has something to personally gain. However, the concept of empirical science itself, when not tainted by the human elements, works to ultimately prove or disprove the given tested theories, in a more or less logical and objective manner. The scientific method does have its inherent limitations, but still  I feel that the evp area of research could have a lot to gain if some &quot;community standards&quot; could be adopted, in order to advance this area of research on common grounds, with a common language, where results could be compared, and apples could be compared to apples. Although none of us personally need this  to prove anything to ourselves - because we already know the communication is real and this conviction and certainty is what drives you  on further - to develop and adopt some sort of common scientific language, with which to discuss results, I think would help to lend a lot more credence to all of this.
 I say this because it looks like such a shame to me that all of the incredible work of you, Steve and all these other people I&#x27;m reading about and talking to online, is so easily ignored, when with the right approach and presentation, it seems to me that these results would be so convincing, that they would not only draw the incredible attention they deserve, but would also be nearly impossible to debunk.  The question of whether or not intelligent communication is occuring through these devices ought to be impossible to debunk, this is my gut feeling from my limited experience with it.  
I don&#x27;t know maybe this is just the naive talk of a novice enthusiast, but this is how I feel.

&gt;  What&#x27;s the chance of a personality coming through that I have gotten often,
&gt; while I&#x27;m doing a test video. &#x27;bout a bazillion to one? How many times do
&gt; they call me &quot;Purple&quot;, just about everytime I turn one of these on.
&gt; 
&gt;  Then, what about other methods, what&#x27;s the chance of the boxes mentioned
&gt; while flipping between channels pairs on cable TV? At 10-11 seconds on this
&gt; video &quot;Your boxes---you hear us&quot;. It&#x27;s not just &quot;a box&quot; thing, it&#x27;s anything
&gt; that provides bits of speech, and/or sound frequencies. Recording seems to
&gt; allow manipulation of the sound bits, as if it&#x27;s done in the air, between
&gt; source and recorder/ear---but you can also get the same thing with no
&gt; external sound, recording from a line output on the box/radio. This subject
&gt; can be extrememly complicated, with many variables.
&gt; 
&gt;  I go by results, screw science, mostly they want what is in the text book,
&gt; or you have to be a PH.D to think of something new. Certain subjects are
&gt; strictly taboo, like anything spirit/God. We&#x27;ve gone round and round
&gt; with the so called skeptics here, they accept no evidence, can&#x27;t test this
&gt; stuff, cuz there maybe a chance of it being real, so they just call us all
&gt; names--real scientific! I mean the mind numbing mental gymnastics these
&gt; dorks do to try explain why there is no conciousness in the universe is
&gt; appalling. Thought experiment by ph.d, that makes it fact!
&gt; 
&gt;  There are supposed paranormal researchers and sites that claim the boxes
&gt; don&#x27;t work, they&#x27;re just veiled skeptics, a skpetic in this case being a
&gt; non-believer that can not be convinced no matter what the evidence.
&gt; 
&gt;  Most important is that users learn life is forever, there are multiple
&gt; levels,  and tell others. That&#x27;s all it&#x27;s for. I don&#x27;t think we are supposed
&gt; to get the absolute proof, there&#x27;s that faith thing--or making one reach
&gt; outside themselves.
&gt; 
&gt;  Try leaving out the &quot;haunted location&quot;, yeah scary but record at home.
&gt; Entites are everywhere, and you may get more repeatble results.

&gt; &gt; What is the general success rate in receiving intelligent word exchanges
&gt; &gt; between the operators and the radio? What percent of the time? And what
&gt; &gt; percentage is considered &quot;better than coincidence&quot;? I know that in
&gt; &gt; statistics, better than 50% is considered better than mere chance, but there
&gt; &gt; is nobody that would disagree that even 25% success rate would be considered
&gt; &gt; &quot;better than coincidence&quot; in the case of using a ghost box. The reason that
&gt; &gt; I ask is because as I&#x27;m really getting into ghost boxes in the last few days
&gt; &gt; I notice that various articles, like the wiki article on evp sound a bit
&gt; &gt; skeptical, yet my first and so far only ghost box session was significantly
&gt; &gt; successful. I left 100% convinced. Does the fact that a person who claims to
&gt; &gt; be psychic was its operator, make a difference in success rate?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was really psyched after leaving the session, which was done at a haunted
&gt; &gt; covered bridge at night, where I also felt what is said to be a ghost (the
&gt; &gt; air feels electrified).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Has anyone in the ghost box operating community ever tried to conduct
&gt; &gt; systematic, videotaped scientifically rigorous repetitions of the sessions?
&gt; &gt; If the kind of success I experienced that night could happen again and
&gt; &gt; again, why are people so skeptical? Incredible as it sounds, it&#x27;s occurring.
&gt; &gt; And just because we can&#x27;t explain why, doesn&#x27;t mean its not happening. I
&gt; &gt; have the whole session recorded and would like to post up some of the
&gt; &gt; snippets (just want to get permission from my local hunting group to make
&gt; &gt; sure its ok), because they are - contrary to claims made in various
&gt; &gt; skeptical articles - NOT, I repeat, NOT just words that people are trying to
&gt; &gt; construct with their minds out of mere noise, they are in fact clearly
&gt; &gt; spoken words coming out of the radio.... at just the right times... again
&gt; &gt; and again... I would say that categorically rules out the possibility of
&gt; &gt; coincidence...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So any info on anyone trying to systematically prove this phenomenon by
&gt; &gt; scientific method? Or has no one tried yet?
