&gt; Thanks, Misty.  I hear you loud and clear...
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m just finishing up on another little research device
&gt; I&#x27;ll be 
&gt; sharing with the group before the day&#x27;s out.
&gt; It&#x27;s similar to my last diode thing, just a slight bit
&gt; different.
&gt; I hope it works...

&gt; &gt; Misty,
&gt; &gt; I would like to be allowed to respond to mike colletta
&gt; in a 
&gt; professional
&gt; &gt; and civil manner
&gt; &gt; I promise a well worded and truthful rebuttal.
&gt; &gt; Bruce &lt;&lt;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Bruce,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I almost decided to let you do that but then I thought
&gt; about it. I 
&gt; also 
&gt; &gt; remembered past issues. It&#x27;s fine if you want to
&gt; respond. In fact I 
&gt; &gt; think I have no right to deny you to do that. However
&gt; I do have a 
&gt; right 
&gt; &gt; to keep you guys from duking it out HERE in this
&gt; forum. It has been 
&gt; &gt; disrupted enough with the petty arguments. So find
&gt; another place to 
&gt; &gt; have your word wars because most of the members here
&gt; are NOT 
&gt; involved 
&gt; &gt; and should not be subjected to such displays of ego.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m sorry but I have to deny your request for
&gt; membership again. 
&gt; &gt; Normally I would email this to you personally but I
&gt; want everyone 
&gt; here 
&gt; &gt; to know that this type of behavior is no longer
&gt; tolerated. I just 
&gt; do 
&gt; &gt; not have time to be referee to peoples personal
&gt; squabbles. So if 
&gt; you 
&gt; &gt; are here to research and learn then no problem. That
&gt; is what this 
&gt; forum 
&gt; &gt; is for. If you are here just to be a negative
&gt; influence then please 
&gt; &gt; take it somewhere else. This forum is not a battle
&gt; ground. 
&gt; &gt; ________________
&gt; &gt; Mike, 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I understand why the conflict made you want to post
&gt; here but again 
&gt; this 
&gt; &gt; is not the place for it. As I stated before most of
&gt; the members 
&gt; here 
&gt; &gt; are not involved in this conflict and shouldnt have to
&gt; be subjected 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; two grown men duking it out over something that they
&gt; had no part in 
&gt; or 
&gt; &gt; even knew about. Most are here to learn and share and
&gt; move forward. 
&gt; &gt; ________________
&gt; &gt; Everyone Else,
&gt; &gt; Up til now this has been a free posting forum and
&gt; nobody has been 
&gt; &gt; moderated. However that could change so please rethink
&gt; your actions 
&gt; &gt; before posting here. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So post it on your websites, start your own forums
&gt; with your own 
&gt; rules 
&gt; &gt; that allow someone to be &quot;victorious&quot;. I see
&gt; no victory in this for 
&gt; &gt; either side and having said that I wish you all well
&gt; in your 
&gt; research. 
&gt; &gt;
