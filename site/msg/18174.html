<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I see a point that frank makes.  For example, my file was very clear that said &quot;marker&quot;.  It doesn&#x27;t mean that we are all nuts, that&#x27;s the information that was given to us.  It was a direct response to a question that i asked.  It&#x27;s not our fault that they gave me bad info, they probably didn&#x27;t know the answer. 

I don&#x27;t want to treat them like some retarded idiots over there, i wish to give them respect.  The fact in my mind is that they are saying something and just because they didn&#x27;t get your test right doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s any less fascinating to me that something talks that shouldn&#x27;t.  They probably could care less what&#x27;s on your monitor.  

They are probably sitting there trying to figure out why you aren&#x27;t doing anything yourself.

&gt;  DAH! again. There&#x27;s way to much expectation created in trying to guess, so
&gt; participants minds interfere with whatever spirit communication there might
&gt; be. You do not understand how this communcations works, nor do you
&gt; understand the effects of the observer, you can not seperate the observer
&gt; from the event in the pararnormal. therefore any results are invalid--before
&gt; you go puffing your chest out thinking how clever you are in debunking
&gt; spirit communication. Even your own expectation that no valid information
&gt; will be received is enough to block all information. But as usual,
&gt; skeptic/debunker ignore all!

&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Experiment 2 - RESULTS!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Thanks to everyone who participated in Experiment 2.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On Friday, 7/16/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer monitor,
&gt; &gt; right in front of me, and left it there until noon Denver time on Monday,
&gt; &gt; 7/19/2010. This experiment asked for participants to determine what that
&gt; &gt; object was. Vague or partial answers would not be counted (for example, just
&gt; &gt; giving a color, shape, size, what it&#x27;s made of, etc): we&#x27;re looking for what
&gt; &gt; it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#x27;t count.
&gt; &gt; Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means
&gt; &gt; they chose.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the object at the start of
&gt; &gt; the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group.
&gt; &gt; The idea with this file is that you could download it at the beginning of
&gt; &gt; the experiment and &#x27;keep it safe&#x27; on your computer. Then at the end of the
&gt; &gt; experiment, I would post the password so you can reveal the contents of the
&gt; &gt; file. That way, you were in control of the original image during the entire
&gt; &gt; time, not me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Passworded pdf:
&gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.pdf
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The password for that file is: 2plus2isFour
&gt; &gt; Instructions, if you need them for the other files, are also in that RJ
&gt; &gt; folder.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So to the results:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Number of participants: 6
&gt; &gt; Total tries: 29
&gt; &gt; Ambiguous answers: 0
&gt; &gt; Correct answers: 0
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Object: Chair
&gt; &gt; Object picture:
&gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.jpg
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As a little side experiment, on Monday I also asked if anyone had gotten
&gt; &gt; any answers that might indicate an article of clothing (though I did not say
&gt; &gt; why I was asking). One theory is that the human operator can be influenced
&gt; &gt; by things they already know or suspect, and so interpret audio with their
&gt; &gt; own personal &#x27;educated guesses&#x27;, that would differ from what they would hear
&gt; &gt; had they not known those things. This side experiment did indicate some
&gt; &gt; support for that theory, since before I mentioned &#x27;articles of clothing&#x27;, no
&gt; &gt; one included an article of clothing in their results. But after I mentioned
&gt; &gt; it, several reports of clothing began to appear. I did not add these tries
&gt; &gt; to the results above.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let me
&gt; &gt; know. Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this experiment.
