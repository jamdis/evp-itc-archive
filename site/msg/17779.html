<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It almost sounded like a transmission, where one says &quot;commence&quot;, or start
talking.

&gt; Sorry I haven&#x27;t been involved for the last week or so. I have been up to my
&gt; eyeballs in the paranormal lately and I needed a break. I am going through
&gt; the posts now and I see it was a lively week.
&gt;
&gt; As for these clips Frank, the first one is exceptional. I hear it slightly
&gt; different from you. To me it sounds like: &quot;Here is Edison everyone.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Could he be announcing himself to the group who was using the box? Or was
&gt; someone introducing him?
&gt;
&gt; Good stuff.
