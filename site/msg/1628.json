I have been on the road a \nlot.  But I wanted to add my two cents on &quot;imprinting,&quot; since Bill \nhas mentioned it.\n\nFor me, it&#39;s a prayer for setting/proclaiming my intention to devote \nmy work with/use of the box to the highest purpose for research, \nenlightenment and understanding.\n\nI do believe that objects retain &quot;imprints&quot; of the consciousness of \ntheir owners -- see for ex. the work of physicist William Tiller on \nimparting intention to objects.  So, I &quot;imprinted&quot; my intention with \nFB Box #22. I invited Bill Murphy and Randy Schneider to participate \nin this prayer, as we had all done some sessions with boxes in March \nat The Stanley.\n\nRegards,\nRosemary Ellen Guiley"}
