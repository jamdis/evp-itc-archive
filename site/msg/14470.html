Not necessarily-maybe it is that just by trying to comm=

 realize that they are manipulating the EMF to make it occur, it just happe=
ns. It's the nature of being of pure energy.

        Pr=
obably not "directly", since that would mean grandma would have to have qui=
te an understanding of digital encoding, including which bits mean what, wh=
en, and where.  But even on a digital recorder, there is still an analog el=
ement (the Analog to Digital converter) which takes the sound pressure wave=
s, as represented by some analog electronic detection element, and converts=
 that into digital.  That way, long departed uncle Ebenezer does not need t=

 the room, but is being induced into the circuitry, then it would be round =
about that AtoD converter (assuming it isn't other just plain old noise in =
the digital elements).  

        Someone with more electronic know-how tha=
n me might be able to better pinpoint the area in the analog portion of tha=
t AtoD pipeline where it would be most likely it could be influenced by, sa=
y, an EM field, and that would also occur in a normal analog tape recorder.=

          This is what I think true EVP is Eric. Not=

             2 different things happening-that' s why. When you get EVP tha=

              EVP that people swear the=
