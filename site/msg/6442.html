I always wonder what spirits are doing hanging around cemeteries anyway.  Y=
ou'd think they would gravitate somewhere more meaningful than where their =
body was deposited, wouldn't you?  I haven't had much luck picking up grave=
yard EVP personally, but I do have one cool one.  I was standing at the doo=
r of a mausoleum where a former governor and his wife are entombed, and I c=
alled the wife's name out loud while recording.  The response is "Hannah is=
n't here!"

  They might. From what I have heard of other pe=
ople's cemetery EVPs, it sounds like a lot of cemeteries are populated with=
 people who haven't made it over. I find cemetery EVP to be the most fascin=
ating because they seem to offer a glimpse into a chaotic and not-so-pretty=
 part of the After Life that very few are willing to look at. Our cemeterie=
s seem to me to truly be cities of the dead.

      Gimme some opinions on this one, gang. The first part of the clip=
 is
      the speed it can through at. The repeat is slowed by about 70 per=
cent.
      I hear it as "Estep." I thought I had heard the word yes, so I =
ask,
      "Yes?" Under my voice is the name "Andrew," then "I'm Stu." "Per=
fect."
      "No..??...asshole...fucking scared."

      Do you hear this a=

      100-year-old sitting atop a =
200+-year-old foundation and cellar, that
