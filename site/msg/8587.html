Hello,

This email message is a notification to let you know that
a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC 
group.

File : /Margaret Downey/Radio Sweep - Manual/ArthurTheTech.mp3 
Uploaded by : itcdeadpeople <ITCdeadpeople@...> 
Description : I've been a little leery about the new tech, Arthur from EVP Maker, so I wanted to see what my trusted tech tech team had to say about him. In the clip I ask, "Whose Arthur?" and they reply, "ARTHUR THE TECH. DESCENT PEOPLE. - HE'S PICKED YOU FROM TECH DAVID. - DAVID HERE." This is a raw clip with the exception of my having removed sweep from between the phrases as indicated by the dashes.
