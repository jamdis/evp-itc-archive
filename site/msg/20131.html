<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I had that one tape, don&#x27;t think I saved it. I use a Versa-corder, so I can

&gt; Frank, if you get a chance check out the psychic twins. They were on c2c a
&gt; while back and their predictions were dead on.
&gt;
&gt; They even played their predictions from a previous show they were on to
&gt; prove they were right.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m hardly ever impressed by psychic, but these woman were good. The field
&gt; got flooded in the past few years, everyone is either a demonologist or a
&gt; psychic now.
&gt;
&gt; Even Chris Moon recently became a psychic, maybe he took an online
&gt; course...lol

&gt; &gt; Validation! Star-whatever was telling about time shifts, and how she uses

&gt; for
&gt; &gt; 2010, sounded more like remote viewing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At least it wasn&#x27;t the same old safe crap Norry usually has on. It was
&gt; &gt; hosted by Strieber.
