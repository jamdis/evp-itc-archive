You have mentioned them before but this is the first time I got to hear them. Thanks for posting them again. I wasn&#39;t around last year when that happened.\n\n~Draiga\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok, here is your &quot;evidence&quot; RJ, last year in spring a  girl was killed, her \n&gt; name was Annie Le, back then i was new to this but, got  some great files, \n&gt; which i gave let police hear on DAY  ONE of her being only still missing.  \n&gt; Even in the files themselves  some spirits are telling me she is dead, her \n&gt; voice came through, I have tons of  them, these are a few, and yes I left what \n&gt; they say on them, some are clearer  then others, and if the police officer \n&gt; was able to hear them, you should be  able to as well. I don&#39;t know why i \n&gt; even bother to worry my head over doubters  anyway.  I posted these to all \n&gt; three lists, because Bruce can  verify what happened  back then too.   You will \n&gt; also  find that the files themselves verify this by the questions asked of  \n&gt; them.   Enjoy,  sf \n&gt;"}
