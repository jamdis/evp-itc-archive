<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello, my name is Roderick Pyatt. I&#x27;m a practicing Paranormal 
Psychologist/Investigator in New Orleans 
&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ghosthuntersneworleans/&gt;. I noted the 
controversy concerning the ITC devise on a couple of other groups 
inspiring my joining this one. I&#x27;ve read through the sites&#x27; communiques 
and am still in the dark as to how the machine works. I know that most 
of the fault lies in the fact that I am totally lost when it comes to 
electronics; theory, construction and use. I am, however, most 
fascinated with what I have read and the obvious possibilites which are 
presented. I am very anxious to learn all I am able to about the 
instrument and have the opportunity to acquire one by whatever manner 
it takes. So, my question at the moment is: How do I acquire one??? I 
would be exteremely appreciative of any assisstance offered. Thank you 
in advance.    --Rod</pre>
