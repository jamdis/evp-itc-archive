<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ann,

Without knowing me, I can understand your offering of other possible
causes of my experience. As investigators, that is our obligation; to
look for all possible causes of supposed paranormal phenomenon. I am
sure that I would have the same reaction as you after having read
about the experience. I have found that the investigators I respect
the most are those with the ability to be skeptical. I train my new
members to be objective.

Now, all that being said... I won&#x27;t attempt to try to persuade you to
believe that my story is exactly what happened. I can&#x27;t and don&#x27;t feel
a need to. I know that any story related by anyone can fall into the
symptoms you state below, including your own. I can only offer you the
following to consider;

I am a 40 year old educated and intelligent female. I am not now, nor
have I ever been in treatment for or taken medication for mental
illness. I have never experienced a panic attack. I do not use drugs.
I am not given to flights of fancy and am described as analytical and
pragmatic. I have been fully involved in the field for 6 years. That
night was the first and only time I ever experienced what I did. I do
not scare. I run towards noises, shadows etc. I am a trusted sensitive
with enough validation to discredit even my own hard core skepticism.I
am objective. 

Now that the majority of a witness interview is complete LOL, I am
done with the post.

&gt; Thank you for sharing that so honestly with me. I really appreciate
it. :)
&gt; 
&gt; Let me give you my comments, none of which are meant to belittle
your experience, rather to provide food for thought: I am sure that
the feelings you experienced (&quot;I began to feel what I can only
describe as &quot;thick&quot; energy move into my hand, up my arm, through my
chest and then settle into my stomach...It began to churn and move up
into my throat..I felt paralyzed. ...It took approximately 30 minutes
before I felt myself again,&quot;) were very real to you. You said you
thought it was evil; that your vomit would be black (an image straight
out of classic demonolgy). Indeed, you said that everyone in the room
had the similar mindset: Whatever you there to confront was
dark/negative/evil.
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking from my own personal experience, I have seen groups of
people involved in the paranormal convince themselves of similar (and
many far, far weirder) things. Hell, as a teen, I was involved in
several of these folies-a-deux (or 10, 15, 20, or more). I saw people
having experiences similar to what you report. At one point, friends
of mine were receiving alledged telepathic communication from a living
rock star who was helping them commune with spirit of Alisdar Crowley,
for example. Others in the group or on its periphery were getting
&quot;attacked&quot; by what we called AWOLs (from &quot;Away Without Leave&quot;). Hell,
I thought I&#x27;d been attacked by a few myself. But now, many years
later, what I see this particular group, and others, was comprised of
was a lot of people damned busy scaring the shit out of themselves.
Maybe real dark forces *were* feeding off the bad vibes--I dunno. But
what I witnessed is rendolent of the Salem hysteria in the late 1600s,
the &quot;Amityville Horror&quot; case, and many, many others, in descending
order of sensationalism, down to the ubiquitous freakouts of kids
playing with the Ouija board.
&gt; 
&gt; Fear and anxiety produce painful and uncomfortabl physical effects
in the body that could be interpreted as caused by a negative outside
influence. Fear causes the body to become flooded with hormones
(particularly adrenalin). Here is a list of symptoms (from Wikipedia)
of what we commonly call a panic attack:
&gt; 
&gt; Physical
&gt; 
&gt;     * An extremely unpleasant sensation of adrenaline over the
entire body
&gt;     * Sweating
&gt;     * Shortness of breath
&gt;     * Racing or pounding heartbeat or palpitations
&gt;     * Chest pain
&gt;     * Dizziness or vertigo
&gt;     * Lightheadedness
&gt;     * Nausea / stomach pains
&gt;     * Hyperventilation
&gt;     * Choking or smothering sensations
&gt;     * Uncontrollable itching
&gt;     * Tingling or numbness in the hands, face, feet or mouth
(paresthesia)
&gt;     * Hot/cold flashes
&gt;     * Trembling or shaking
&gt;     * Feeling of claustrophobia
&gt;     * Exhaustion
&gt;     * Feeling of physical weakness or limpness of the body
&gt;     * Uncontrollable crying
&gt; 
&gt; Mental
&gt;     * Loss of the ability to react logically to stimuli
&gt;     * Loss of cognitive ability in general
&gt;     * Racing thoughts (often based on fear; a repeated or illogical
worry)
&gt;     * Loud internal dialogue
&gt;     * Feeling of impending doom
&gt;     * Feeling of &quot;going crazy&quot;
&gt;     * Extreme worried feeling
&gt;     * Feeling of extreme nervousness
&gt;     * Feeling out of control
&gt;     * Feeling of Threatening
&gt;     * Feeling of anti-social behaviour from other people
&gt;     * Feeling of excitement
&gt;     * Feeling of nagging from other people
&gt;     * Vision is somewhat impaired (eyes may feel like they are shaking.)
&gt; 
&gt; Emotional
&gt; 
&gt;     * Terror, or a sense that something unimaginably horrible is
about to occur and one is powerless to prevent it
&gt;     * Fear that the panic is a symptom of a serious illness
&gt;     * Fear of losing control
&gt;     * Fear of death
&gt;     * Fear of going crazy
&gt;     * Flashbacks to earlier panic trigger
&gt; 
&gt;  Perceptual
&gt; 
&gt;     * Tunnel vision
&gt;     * Heightened senses
&gt;     * The apparent slowing down or speeding up of time
&gt;     * Dream-like sensation or perceptual distortion (derealization)
&gt;     * Dissociation, or the perception that one is not connected to
the body or is disconnected from space and time (depersonalization)
&gt;     * Feeling of loss of free will, as if acting entirely
automatically without control
&gt; 
&gt; I have to submit that the symptoms you describe for yourself and
others involved that night are found on this list. In fact, a lot of
descriptions of &quot;attacks by dark forces&quot; sound like the physiological
effects of fear and anxiety. Am I saying you had a panic attack? No.
But I am suggesting it is a possibility to consider. Because you were
in a situation where you believed that &quot;evil&quot; would be present, thus
generating fear, Occam&#x27;s Razor would certainly lead us to conclude
that adrenaline that made you feel the way you did. But Occam&#x27;s Razor
proves it&#x27;s general trustworthines by periodic exceptions.
&gt; 
&gt; HMO and not an attack or judgement on your (or anyone&#x27;s) beliefs,
&gt; 
&gt; Ann

&gt; &gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Negative Experience
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Ann,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I tried to relocate the post in which you asked me about my negative
&gt; &gt;experiences. After 10 minutes searching... new topic.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As it relates to the box, I really only have two personal experiences
&gt; &gt;that might be considered negative. 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The first one is contained in a posting I just made prior to this. I
&gt; &gt;will refer you back to it, if you don&#x27;t mind. The experience is
&gt; &gt;contained in the copy and paste from my April 17, 2007 blog. It did
&gt; &gt;not effect me personally  but I did witness the effects of negative
&gt; &gt;energy on what/who came through the box. 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The second negative experience is one I have not spoken of to anyone
&gt; &gt;besides who was there that day and one close trusted friend. This
&gt; &gt;occurred in September of this year:
&gt; &gt;Chris, myself and four others who will remain nameless, were gathered
&gt; &gt;in a hotel room. For the sake of the story, I will refer to the main
&gt; &gt;subject as Mary. 
&gt; &gt;Mary had been experiencing severe negative phenomenon for years. This
&gt; &gt;included poltergeist type activity, personal harm and had since moved
&gt; &gt;into effecting her young son. I can not get into the exact details of
&gt; &gt;this negativity but suffice it to say that all accounts led everyone
&gt; &gt;to believe that Mary was dealing with a demon or demons. 
&gt; &gt;This was the second time Mary had sought out Chris for assistance. 
&gt; &gt;The first time she had noticed a change for a short time but then
&gt; &gt;&quot;things&quot; had returned as before and in some instances had worsened.
&gt; &gt;This particular day Mary found herself surrounded by trusted friends
&gt; &gt;and was ready to try again. There was a psychic medium, a healer and,
&gt; &gt;myself, a sensitive along with another person with no stated
&gt; &gt;abilities. Our goal was to turn on the box and receive some direction
&gt; &gt;about what to do and how to help. I won&#x27;t reveal the details of what
&gt; &gt;was said as they are not relevant to the post topic. 
&gt; &gt;As some time went on and we moved into a second session with the box,
&gt; &gt;Chris became noticeably weaker. It was obvious that his energy was
&gt; &gt;being used. I noticed that I was becoming quite weepy. You&#x27;ll have to
&gt; &gt;take my word on this when I say I am not a weepy person. Sensitive or
&gt; &gt;not, I do not become emotional. Yet as time passed, I found I couldn&#x27;t
&gt; &gt;control the tears falling. I rationalized it by recognizing I was
&gt; &gt;probably becoming emotional with compassion as Mary discussed very
&gt; &gt;private issues. 
&gt; &gt;The psychic medium present told us at this point that we should place
&gt; &gt;our hands on Mary. Not considering that I was in no state to offer
&gt; &gt;energy/help to anyone, I placed my hand on Mary&#x27;s leg. Suddenly, I
&gt; &gt;began to feel what I can only describe as &quot;thick&quot; energy move into my
&gt; &gt;hand, up my arm, through my chest and then settle into my stomach. As
&gt; &gt;it sat in my stomach I could literally feel it turn into sludge. It
&gt; &gt;began to churn and move up into my throat. At this point, I knew I was
&gt; &gt;going to vomit and I knew it would be black. I knew this was evil.
&gt; &gt;Fortunately, some focus switched to me at this point because I felt
&gt; &gt;paralyzed. I was removed from the room and brought outside where, with
&gt; &gt;assistance, I was able to let go of what was not mine. It took
&gt; &gt;approximately 30 minutes before I felt myself again.
&gt; &gt;Back to Mary for a moment; After the sessions that night, she had a
&gt; &gt;noticeable physical change, in particular to her face. It shocked me.
&gt; &gt;Where she had appeared hard or almost calloused in her expressions,
&gt; &gt;she was now much softer in appearance. Her life improved dramatically.
&gt; &gt;She has had one more session with Chris and the box and things
&gt; &gt;continue to improve.
&gt; &gt;The TTTD or Frank&#x27;s Box or whatever you want to refer to it as, is a
&gt; &gt;powerful device. It has the ability to connect to other dimensions. It
&gt; &gt;can be a wonderful thing. It can also be quite scary in the wrong
&gt; &gt;hands. I believe that just as good can be called upon to help, so can
&gt; &gt;dark and we know that there are many people out there who are far more
&gt; &gt;concerned in working with lower levels than the higher.
