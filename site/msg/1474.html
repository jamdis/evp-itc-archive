<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for posting that Frank, I could hear it. Box #22 is Rosemary&#x27;s 
and we had an &quot;imprinting&quot; session so she could be introduced as a 
new Box operator. Otherwise that call for Frank repeatedly it seems.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Bill said something that had me thinking. He mentioned that when 
he first 
&gt; &gt;got his box it called Franks name repeatedly. That isnt the first 
time I 
&gt; &gt;saw someone say that. I know quite a few of you now have been 
given a box 
&gt; &gt;or even constructed your own versions like Steve based on the work 
Frank 
&gt; &gt;did.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   I have heard a couple of peoples results here but I would like 
to hear 
&gt; &gt;more so I am going to ask if you have one you comment on your use 
of it and 
&gt; &gt;how you think the results went as well as maybe post a few sound 
files that 
&gt; &gt;I can hear. I have spent years listening to the box voices but its 
&gt; &gt;refreshing to hear others results and see the variations as with 
any other 
&gt; &gt;evp method, it differs by user/location. LOL you know who you are 
and I 
&gt; &gt;wont name you all but I do hope you will share with us.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   Thanks!
&gt; &gt;   Misty
