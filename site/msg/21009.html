<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>First off, there are some diagrams, I believe, in the Files or Photos
sections of some of Frank&#x27;s boxes. There&#x27;s really not a lot to it. Get
a radio with electronic tuning capability and build a sweep circuit.
Frank just posted a circuit for a sweep the other day. You could even
do manual tuning with an analog radio by tuning the knob up and down.

Why do you need to record above 20 kHz? You can&#x27;t hear it. No one that
I know of has captured any EVP or ITC even close to that range. Most
of my EVP have been in the lower normal human voice range.

&gt; Hi!
&gt; Can anyone help me out in making a Frank&#x27;s Ghost Box...with easy steps of
&gt; assembling the components...i would really appreciate ur efforts..
&gt; Secondly i have a question for u guys....i am using sony IC recorder model
&gt; ICDPX820 533 hours recording for EVP but the limitation of this IC recorder
&gt; is that it records in MP3 format which is not required as wav format is more
&gt; reliable and is closest to what u actually hear. and the next is its
&gt; frequency range is 75 hz to 20 k and above 20 k it does not record any
&gt; thing...
&gt; so what is the best model available for EVP recording and is there anything
&gt; which can be modified in the sony IC recorder so that it can record freq of
&gt; more than 20 k...
&gt; Hey i know it is time taking to answer these questions..but i ill be obliged
&gt; if somebody out of u help me out....
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Regards
