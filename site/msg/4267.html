  Subject: [EVP-ITC=
] The RS box out does itself again


  guy's

  During a session with the R=
S 470 my technition mike told me that our 
  fellow researcher Jeff's uncle=
 was going to die from suffering a stroke.

  I informed jeff of the messag=
e and sent him the file. He wrote back 
  asking If I could confirm this an=
d get his uncles name.

  I did another quick session with the RS 470 and r=
ecieved the name mark 
  from my guide lisa just once and then mike and lis=
a both shouted BOB,BOB
  die. 

  I notified Jeff of this and he confirmed =
he had both an uncle Mark And 
  an uncle Bob, after inquiring about the co=
ndition of his uncle Bob he 
  was informed that his uncle Bob was hospital=
ised and graveley ill.

  He has not as of now suffered a stroke thank god,=
 but jeff seems to 
  think his prognoses is not good.

  I ask that we all=
 say a prayer for Uncle Bob.

  I posted this and the accompanying file for=
 pure research sake.

  Jeff has said he will keep me posted and I will app=
ropriately keep the 
  group informed.

  Bruce
