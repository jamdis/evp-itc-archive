            Hmmm if you are getting digital blocks then you probably just need to move the cam closer to the viewing window or make the viewing window larger. Since it wont let you run it full screen move it close enough you no longer see the "window" or block part. You dont want it to record anything other than the "darkness" inside the viewing window. Then adjust the angle slightly until you start to see bright flashes of light (which arent anything on screen to the side of the viewing window)
   
  Its much easier using a fullscreen to catch on to how to create the loop and the light. I usually just turn on my screen cam program and put it on full screen then click video capture to start recording. Amy you do realize that you can click and drag the corners of that screen to enlarge the window to almost fullscreen size right?
   
  LOL if not then do that, you dont have to goto full screen you can just enlarge the window so it covers most of your screen.

        Ok, so the program wont let me use FULL frame mode AND record at the same time, i even re-installed like you said to do, but nope. Unless im missing some trick? When i hold the cam up to the frame so that only the frame is in view <loopback?>,  what i get is ALOT of didgital color blocks that come up, some flashes and some black n white blocks of lines, kinda like tv not tuned in. Am i doing this right? 
  So, is it supposed to pick -up whats in the room? Or just whoever whats to show up on the tape?
