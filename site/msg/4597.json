I got a brand-spanking new audio mixer today for $8, so I just \n&gt; had to put a new Radio Shack Hack configuration together.\n&gt; See it here: http://ufogeek.com/?p=182\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt;\n    . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    Hi Mike!  Wow! I really like the 2 speakers & the small mixer you show on your photo!!  Where did you get/find the mixer (for $8) and the 2 speakers (how much)???  I have a RS 12-469 that I hacked. I have &quot;El Cheap-o&quot; $1. dual speakers, but I have to put the dynamic mic right next to them + put the RS Hack volume to max, to record! Not the greatest, but it works. Let me/us know, thanks!!   8-))  =Judy="}
