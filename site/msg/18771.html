&gt; Going through some stuff today and came across this box.  Ron from
&gt; paranormalsystems.com only sold a dozen of these and i think 11 came back
&gt; to him.  That project was a disaster from start to finish.  I tried to help,
&gt; but cheap parts were used to build it.
&gt;
&gt; I took it apart today to look and see what i can do to improve it.  The
&gt; first thing i noticed was a crappy antenna, so i swapped it out with one
&gt; from a broken radio sitting here.
&gt;
&gt; Reception did improve, but it still sucks.  It&#x27;s like polishing a
&gt; turd......Sorry, i know that was disgusting.
&gt;
&gt; This box is AM Random mode only.  I think when you try to get too advanced
&gt; with building these, that&#x27;s when the problems start.  Simple is the best way
&gt; to do it.  I&#x27;ve attached the raw audio of the test with it and some sample
&gt; files i got.
&gt;
&gt; Now i guess it goes back into the closet where i got it from.
