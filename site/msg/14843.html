Snowfirel,
I was responding to your message and got disconnected (storming =
down here LOL) so not sure if any of it made it thru so I will repeat what =
I can of my original response.
=A0
Bruce is no longer a member of the EVP-I=
TC group. When responding to his messages please post ONLY in his group or =
wherever you are responding to. I know that you like to cross post to all g=
roups at once. 
=A0
He is no longer allowed to post here because of his vic=
ious attacks on members and we definitely do not tolerate attacks on our fo=
unding member Frank S who started this group in the first place. Bruce lost=
 his posting abilities a long time ago because quite frankly we had seen en=
ough of the attacks. He would attack someone, unjoin then rejoin and apolog=
ize, it would be calm a while then the cycle would repeat itself. I think y=
ou will see the same if you check the archives of any group he has been a m=
ember of. 
=A0
Frank likes to vent too. He often gets tired of these attack=
s in his inbox or things people say upset him. I personally have no problem=
 with people who vent its when they email members privately and threaten th=
em that it becomes a problem. Unfortunately this is why I can not let=A0bru=
ce rejoin our group even tho he has tried to many times. It makes me very s=
ad.
=A0
I understand your wishes for everyone to work together. We all have=
 a common goal when it comes to the research, but sometimes people are not =
focused on the research they have other things on their minds.
=A0
That bei=
ng said Bruce is no longer allowed to post here and members of this group w=
ho post for him risk the same consequences. As you notice if frank copies w=
hat crap bruce is emailing he is at least nice enough to leave the guys nam=
e out. Those who know Bruce know who it came from. Those who dont he has a =
chance for a fresh start with and I hope he uses it wisely. I wish him luck=
 and hope the best for him but theres no more I can do to help. I tried man=
y times to stop the fighting between everyone and it may end for a short wh=
ile but then things like this start to happen.
=A0
Please refrain from post=
ing responses to bruce in our forum. I dont say this to upset you any furth=
er... instead I say it because the research we do is far more important tha=
n anyones ego or being the right one in an argument. I think you agree with=
 me there since you wish they would all kiss and make up. I'd like nothing =
better but at this point I dont see them doing that. 
=A0
I cant change peo=
ple from being who they are, all I can do is change myself. I am sorry for =
any distress this causes you. Believe me I understand. I am not telling you=
 to stop being friends with anyone either, if anything they could use such =
a postive spirit in their lives. Lead by example, dont follow blindly.
=A0
=
Love and Light!!

Misty

guy=

Sorry to burden you with this nonsense but this group and the RTSC grou=

t heard, I hope you do not mind to much.

Here is a copy of my final person=
al e-mail to Frank Sumption which by the way is meant for him but he see's =
fit to post them publicly in an attempt to discredit me.

I want you to rea=
d it first hand so there are no chance of it being altered before it is pos=
ted else where.

I will not address Frank again
------------ --------- ----=
----- --------- --------- --------- -

Frank,

This is getting ridiculous n=
ow, you should stop writing these posts, all you are doing is making yourse=
lf look ridiculous.

I have offered many times to make my raw recordings av=
ailable for review by anyone who wants them. I have made the same challenge=
 to your friend moon who we all know is behind this tirade he has time and =
again refused or ignored the request for any type of audio file
to be publi=
cly posted for revue and continues to take advantage of innocent unsuspecti=
ng people with his con game and charging large amounts of money for session=
s where he fabricates and makes up content as he goes along.

I was the onl=
y one to confront him in public and expose him for the fake he is and this =
is his feeble attempt at retaliation. I and other researchers like me have =
brought this research light years from where it was when you and I first me=
t, moon just continues to use it to rip people off and has not contributed =
a thing to the research of ghost box communication beside lining his own po=
ckets. 

Just the fact that he has you doing his dirty work shows the type =
of guy he is. I can remember a time when you publicly came out against any =
type of money making using your boxes and even refused moon when he wanted =
to manufacture and sell them for large profits yet now you condone his robb=
ery of innocent unaware people and actually act foolish on his behest.

Fra=
nk you are better than this, just concentrate on developing a better box an=
d forget about moon and his tricks and lies, he is finished in the paranorm=
al and he knows it, everyone is wise to his game and he is practically an o=
utcast.

Frank you are hitching you wagon to a dead horse. Get away from th=
ese bad influences before they ruin your reputation as well.

We have had t=
his moon discussion in the past and once he has exhausted his need for you =
he will screw you again like he has done so many times before.

Frank, I li=
ke and respect you and I hope you will consider what I have said in this e-=
mail and I sincerely hope you post this one on the evp-itc group. I will be=
 posting it on my group and others I belong to.

Your former friend
Bruce
