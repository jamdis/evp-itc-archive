<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I strongly recommend that if you&#x27;re serious about EVP work - you 
should get a copy of the English translation of Konstantin Raudive&#x27;s 
first book &quot;Breakthrough: An Amazing Experiment With Electronic 
Communication With The Dead&quot; and D.J. Ellis&#x27; book &quot;The Mediumship of 
the Tape Recorder&quot;.

Both can be found on the Amazon UK web site and copies are still 
available even though Ellis&#x27; book is long out of print.

Raudive&#x27;s book:

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Breakthrough-Amazing-Experiment-Electronic-
Communication/dp/0900675543/ref=sr_1_1/203-4923892-9954337?
ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1172891158&amp;sr=1-1

Ellis&#x27; book: 

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mediumship-Tape-Recorder-David-
Ellis/dp/095060240X/ref=sr_1_1/203-4923892-9954337?
ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1172891351&amp;sr=1-1

I bought my copy of Ellis&#x27; book there over 6 months ago (I found a 
paperback copy of &quot;Breakthrough&quot; at a local used 
bookstore)...Amazon.co.uk took my credit card easily, made the 
proper currency exchange (I usually check first with an online 
currency exchange calculator), and shipped it via e-mail. Got the 
book within a few days!

You can also find used and difficult-to-find books at ABE Books 
(these 2 are listed at the moment):

The Internet is a godsend for those of us who need items only 
available elsewhere in the world and so are credit cards as far as 
making payments easier.

I would also recommend Alec&#x27;s book and CD (I got the electronic 
download versions): &quot;EVP And New Dimensions&quot; and &quot;The Sounds of 
EVP&quot;, respectively.

Here&#x27;s his ordering web site:
