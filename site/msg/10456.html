Hi, my name is Wes Kellington, and I am from Waynesboro, VA.  This is my
second post since joining the group
on March 1.

I came here specifically to listen and learn from Frank Sumption and to
likeminded individuals.  I am a ham radio operator,
although I have not been active in years since the CB'ers kind of took over
with their new no-code rules, and am a
computer technician.  I have been passionately pursuing paranormal interests
since I was a child.  So, Frank, please
keep on supplying us with your knowledge and foresight.  I look forward to
your posts; and I read all of them.

I read all the posts, even by the guy with the gall to ask for someone to
send him a radio.  Yes, I would give anything
to have one; but I would not dare ask someone to do that for me.  That's
just wrong!  And as far as threatening
personal emails, what the Hell has been the matter with people?  My wife is
the business manager of a local
psychiatric practice.  The day of the full moon, they had more patients and
admitted more people to the psychiatric
wing of the hospital than ever!

This is off-topic.  I have been dealing with a personal problem for the past
several weeks.  I had a chest X-ray; and
on it they found a 2.5 cm nodule in one of my lungs.  My catscan is May 8th
to make sure I do not have lung cancer.
The waiting is killing me.  It's like being on death row and waiting to see
if the phone rings.  So, I have not had the
energy to do anything lately.  I am only waiting...

Hopefully, there will be a positive outcome, and then I can delve into this
further and begin some research of my own.

Frank, please stick around.

Wes
