That's good to hear.  I'm assuming that the A&E folks who posted that 
honestly didn't know any better.  You can't expect their public 
relations people to be totally up on the world of paranormal research 
(although you'd think they might question why someone named Chris would 
name "his" invention after someone else!).  Regardless, whoever led them 
to believe that Moon invented Frank's Box deserves a good talking to.

Oh, and I was mistaken - it's next week's episode.  For some reason, 
they list that first on their schedule.
