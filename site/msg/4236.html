 Well, when ya get someone giving seemingly valid reasons why these new methods are invalid, or questionable, then I turn on the RS hack rig, and "they" are singing "Purple" across the band, and then the scan starts again at the bottom of AM with "DO NOT---QUIT-- --GROUP" (the --- indicate gaps with no broadcasts or voice fragments), I'm supposed to believe that's just my imagination, that these things don't work. The fact is all these methods work, and they have in fact been used long before the box. 

 

 This "Researcher" I was arguing with yesterday no doubt thought he had me convinced, and on his side. I can't go there after I get clear, coherent, meaningful messages with these other methods. I would like to keep the disaggreements friendly, and the discussions friendly, and I do consider the opposing viewpoint, but it just doesn't hold water in the case of these alternate radio methods. That's why no interviews, and no in person meetings--as such, I can be put into a postion of sympathy with a person when I don't actually agree. It's called lack of assertiveness, and I did in fact fail assertiveness training in the community college! As soon as the meeting is over though, I'm going to tell ya to bite me, and do my own thing anyway. 

 

 I think we all have to be very careful when critisizing someone's work here, research, or comments--in public. So far very little of the EVP stuff can be considered hard evidence, it's all what they call anecdotal, or it's what one or more witnesses experienced, but it's not repeatable-- pretty much. Or you can't grab someone off the street, have them listen to voices and expect they'll hear it. 

 

 I can't say my results are anymore valid than anyone else's' but I also can't accpet that anyone else's results are more valid than my own. I am an independent researcher, I do this work on my own, it's more like just a hobby. I don't sell anything, and I make nothing by endorsing other products. When I say the Mini Box works, and the Radio Shack hack works, that is the honest thing to do, it's not cuz I get a kick back, as I get nothing in return, except to know I did the right thing. 

 

 As for this other "Researcher" , I don't know what to tell ya. I can only ask, give us some friggin' credit! There's some good peole here, and to dismiss us, and all or our results is extremely insulting.

 

 As for the possiblities of danger with this research, I've been thinking about that. First I don't know of anyone else that has had any problems directly related to box use, and or paranormal work fro that matter.  It's like listening to some bible thumper swearing the devil is really right there, just waiting to jump down your throat, and yet, there's..... nothing. So far it's more threatening to cross the street every morning (I usually walk to work). 

 

 I pretty much work by myself, I like it that way, and sharing what I get here. I don't wanna be TAPS, or any other thing. I don't care who accepts my results, I do this for myself, for my own curiosity. I'm not going to accept someone else's version of reality, and I trust my own intuition.

 

 I'm sorry if someone thought I implied this shit came from  Edison, or anyone else. I don't recall that. It's more likely that someone suggested it was Edison's concept, or whatever, and I kinda agreed it was like that for discussion-- I don't know.  I know how it came about in my own mind, as problems are often solved, your own subconcius mind will assemble an answer based on previous experience, and I had worked with voltage tunable radios in the mid 90's, then I got interested in EVP, then I used EVPmaker, then my own mind connected all the dots, nothing mysterious, or other worldly about it. It's that same process that takes place when you sleep on a problem, and wake up with a solution. I did not understand the process at first, but it's very common.
