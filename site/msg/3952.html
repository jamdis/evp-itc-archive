<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m not so much worried about whether there are other types of  
entities out there trying to communicate as I am annoyed if they get  
in the way of the entities I really want to communicate with. As you  
may have notices from the previous discussion, I don&#x27;t tend to worry  
about negative forces. I worry more about simple human/nonhuman  
identity thieves. Hell, Lance--it&#x27;s all in the phrasing, isn&#x27;t? If I  
want to hear from my Nanny, I&#x27;d like it to be my Nanny, thank you  
very much. And woe betide any alien/idiot human/whatever who tries to  
mess with me. ;)

&gt; Hey Ann,

&gt; I&#x27;m totally on the same page about finding out the truth, whatever it
&gt; may be. I know there are tricksters. Native Americans call them
&gt; Coyote or Skinwalkers.
&gt;
&gt; From the clear voices and degree of two-way dialog, for me it&#x27;s
&gt; simply about getting straight answers. I&#x27;m planning to try and be
&gt; rigorous about testing any spirits or whatever they are before
&gt; proceeding. The last thing I wish to do is entertain some demon or
&gt; entity that is all about lying and half-truths.

&gt; &gt; But it must raise questions, mustn&#x27;t it, Bruce? Who are these
&gt; &gt; entities we are talking to and why would it be such a problem for
&gt; us
&gt; &gt; to know who they were in life? If these are dead humans, it can&#x27;t
&gt; see
&gt; &gt; how it would make any difference at all. In fact, to me, being
&gt; able
&gt; &gt; to talk about human things with them is rather the only way to
&gt; prove
&gt; &gt; that they are dead humans. It does concern me that these entities
&gt; are
&gt; &gt; not human, not because I would particularly care if they were
&gt; &gt; extraterrestrial or extradimentional and just admitted that, but
&gt; &gt; because my personal desire is to talk to people like me who have
&gt; &gt; crossed over.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can you ask them to give you some sort of reason why they can&#x27;t
&gt; tell
&gt; &gt; you more about themselves?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, my 2 cents. I know that my line of inquiry with the box is
&gt; &gt; going to be directed at people who have crossed. Maybe I&#x27;ll get
&gt; some
&gt; &gt; answers of my own shortly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Ann,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; What I get from mike &amp; Lisa when I ask personal questions about
&gt; &gt; &gt; them is a reluctant answer at best.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have already thought to ask all of the questions you mention
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; more and have been answered with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;NO&quot; &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; and things like &quot;Wait&quot; so I&#x27;m assuming that they
&gt; are
&gt; &gt; &gt; either not allowed or are not ready for me to find
&gt; &gt; &gt; out about their physical lives. I also get the impression that
&gt; they
&gt; &gt; &gt; want to remain as separate entities in my mind
&gt; &gt; &gt; and if I where to know who and what they where in the physical
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; would reduce them to a lower level of spirituality
&gt; &gt; &gt; in my mind. that is the general jist of the messages as far as
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; subject goes.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Rambling thoughts:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The sound quality was not as good with this batch. Lots more
&gt; &gt; &gt; background. Did you change anything?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay--I am completely fascinated with who these people are who
&gt; talk
&gt; &gt; &gt; to us. I have two, both male, and god knows who they really are,
&gt; &gt; &gt; because one has changed identity at least six times over the
&gt; years,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and one won&#x27;t tell anything at all about himself. Period. Oh, he
&gt; says
&gt; &gt; &gt; that he won&#x27;t talk through the box either. I&#x27;m tempted to add, &quot;So
&gt; &gt; &gt; there&quot; as a direct quote. LOL. Anyway, Mike and Lisa-- So Mike
&gt; says
&gt; &gt; &gt; he bled to death in &#x27;95; Lisa choked to death in the 1920s and
&gt; nuts
&gt; &gt; &gt; to you for asking, apparently. ;)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Would you ask them some questions for me?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ask Mike which &#x27;95 he died in--1995 or 1895?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ask Lisa what her favorite perfume was.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ask them both more biographical questions, such as where the were
&gt; &gt; &gt; born, lived, and died. Their full names. Their spouses&#x27; names,
&gt; kids,
&gt; &gt; &gt; etc. I&#x27;m a historian/geneologist and I think it would be a blast
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; look in available records to try to identify them.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ask them the year of their birth. If they tell you, there&#x27;s a lot
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; historical questions I love to ask about events within their
&gt; &gt; &gt; lifetimes.
