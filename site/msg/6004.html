Juli,
 
It was awesome this weekend.  Got some great material.  It was  great to do  
box sessions with you,  especially with the results we  got out of it.  It was 
a pleasure to be working with such professional  people.  I am looking 
forward to doing more sessions with you and Joel, and  of course Joe ....:)  Talk to 
you soon.
 
Jeff

Guys, 
I just posted several files from a joint session this weekend in  
Kentucky. I would appreciate the imput from those who are serious  
about the research here. Many of the serious researchers have spent  
years, and countless hours a day testing these lines of communication.  
I for one refuse to allow the negitive get to me and will continue to  
work either independently or with my fellow colleages who truly respect  
each other and their contributions in this area.

So with that being  said, I hope you enjoy the audio clips. 
They are from a Joe's Box  session.

In addition, I have introduced several new researchers to the  
RS hacked in hopes that their their future studies will add in our up  
hill climb in pursuing what we  started.

Thanks!
Juli
