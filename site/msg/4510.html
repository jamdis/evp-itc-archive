I've gotten some saying my first and some saying my last names!!!! 
That, convinces me it's not a radio station but actual 
voices/EVP's!!! I just wish I could find some 
inexpensive amplified speakers for the RS 12-469 I have that could get 
the volume up (with the speakers I have, I have to turn up the RS Hack 
volume to max, to hear/record)! The Philips Sterio speakers at Rite 
Aid, ($13.) are round for PC, MP3, & CD's it says on the box, I'm 
wondering IF I should get them to try out? =Judy=
