Yeah...I will only comment if someone asks me to listen, an then I just tel=
l them what I hear. I keep my judgments to myself about if I think it is ac=
tual communication or not. That is unless they ask for my opinion.

    Yep April you are right. Remaining open to the =
possibility is hard enough for most people. Again its a case of prove or di=
sprove it for yourself. Not everyone comes to the same conclusions or gets =
the exact same results. Maybe similar but not exact. 

        I tend to us=
e a variety of methods. When voices come from things such as water or out o=
f thin air sometimes its a easier for some to believe there is something th=
ere that they were not aware of.

        But again they have to prove it f=
or themselves to be able to have that eye opening moment.

        I only c=
omment on what I hear or dont hear. My speaker set up is a bit different th=
an most. I hate headphones. Others prefer them. Some use pc speakers. Resul=
ts vary based on the individual. What I hear you may not then again you jus=
t might hear it exactly the same. I dont worry about that. Just keep explor=
ing with an open mind.

            I think it varies depending on who you ask as well as=
 what they have personally experienced. As an example, some people believe =
in angels and demons others do not. Therefor some may get messages that cor=
respond to their own beliefs as well as the beliefs of those who are speaki=
ng.

            Almost every person who does this eventually develops a th=
eory that may change over time based on what they experience and what their=
 beliefs are. Then there are those who remain undecided or have doubts.

  =
          As for me I look at it as purely educational, a learning experien=
ce. Ive met many people I never knew existed. Ive researched topics I'd nev=
er even considered. Ive gotten messages and images that are awe inspiring a=
nd many interesting concepts to ponder and explore.

            There are =
many glimpses of truth, as well as momentary proof along the way that lead =
me to develop my own theory and eventually you will develop your own too. T=
his research is fascinating and can be quite mind blowing.

            I d=
ont worry what anyone else thinks. I have no need to prove anything to anyo=
ne else. They can do that for themselves. I always say honesty is the best =
policy and if you are honest with yourself and others the only ones who obj=
ect are those who's lies arent tolerated. So just look for the truth yourse=
lf and dont let me or anyone else tell you what that is. 

            It's=
 a great journey and your path is your own!
