<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hallo Frank,

&gt; My family (the Binders) are from around Freising, Bayern (around
&gt; Munich).

Intresting; that&#x27;s where I currently live, too (a few km east of Munich).

&gt; I haven&#x27;t been posting much lately, been working too much. I work with
&gt; lasers and light mostly as a transmission source. I think you are on
&gt; to something with using parts of speech for a sound source. I got
&gt; distracted for a little while playing with these hacks and boxes as
&gt; they like to call them. They are effective but limited in my use of
&gt; them.

Yes, there&#x27;s yet a lot to research and to improve. What are you doing
with lasers/light?

Stefan</pre>
