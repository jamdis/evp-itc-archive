Based on your previous posts on this \ngroup, you don&#39;t believe that real time spirit communication is \npossible.

What about the other 2 files i posted?  You can&#39;t deny \n&gt; \n&gt; that there is some sort of communication going on, even the hardest \n&gt; \n&gt; skeptics as yourself have to admit the validity of those files.  I \n&gt; \n&gt; believe in a random chance of a stray radio signal coinsiding with \n&gt; \n&gt; the question asked at that time, but after 2 years and 4000 files \n&gt; \n&gt; later i have to believe that this communication is real.  I also \nuse \n&gt; \n&gt; other methods that do not involve a radio at all, what could make \n&gt; \n&gt; that happen?  These are all good questions to make someone re-think \n&gt; \n&gt; their stance on RTSC and other ITC devices.  How can a scrambled up \n&gt; \n&gt; file on a computer program called evpmaker say full sentences up to \n&gt; \n&gt; 25 words in length?  Did i mention that the original file that was \n&gt; \n&gt; used had no words in it at all, only bits and pieces of audio \n&gt; \n&gt; segments.  Something to think about anyway.  I used to stand on \nyour \n&gt; \n&gt; side of the fence, but after a while it can no longer be ignored \nthat \n&gt; \n&gt; what we are hearing is really happening.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Rj &lt;rasterer@ .&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t hear anything intelligible.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; If I try to work out the sounds as phonemes, it sounds like:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ah He La Naw Tay\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Try reading that: Ah He La Naw Tay\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then listen to the sound again.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Sun, 1/25/09, Roxy young &lt;horsewhisper4u@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Roxy young &lt;horsewhisper4u@ ...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Date: Sunday, January 25, 2009, 6:49 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;             what I heard. was. &quot; she&#39;s not dead&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Sun, 1/25/09, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com &lt;EVP-\n&gt; \n&gt; ITC@yahoogroups .com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroup s .com&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Date: Sunday, January 25, 2009, 7:39 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; File : /Steve Hultay Files/MiniBox Plus/steve_hultay. mp3 \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Uploaded by : urkel232002 &lt;urkel23@aol. com&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Description : &quot;Steve Hultay&quot;----For them to say my full name it \n&gt; \n&gt; quite impressive. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/EVP- ITC/files/ Steve%20Hultay% \n&gt; \n&gt; 20Files/MiniBox% 20Plus/steve_ hultay.mp3 \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://help. yahoo.com/ l/us/yahoo/ groups/original/\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  members/web/ index.htmlfiles\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; urkel232002 &lt;urkel23@aol. com&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
