The photos were interesting; some\n&gt; &gt; of them looked like mere double exposures, others did show what could\n&gt; &gt; be the superimposition of another face from another dimension.

I met him about 3 years\n&gt; &gt; ago.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My husband is a commercial photographer and Mark asked him to do\n&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; portrait for a book he was coming out with. He came to our home\n&gt; &gt; studio\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for the portrait, and I got to talk with him a little about what\n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; does. At that time all I knew of EVP was from the White Noise\n&gt; &gt; movie,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t sure it was real. But Mark was very nice, passionate about\n&gt; &gt; ITC/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; EVP and very convincing. I wasn&#39;t quite sure what to expect when I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; originally heard what he did, with all the loonies out there\n&gt; &gt; claiming\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all kinds of stuff, but I got a really good feeling from him and\n&gt; &gt; he&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very, well, like I said, convincing. After that I went to his web\n&gt; &gt; site\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and also bought one of his books, which was a nice read.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I went to the Stanley Hotel in November with a ghost hunting group\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mark was a speaker there. I was really looking forward to his\n&gt; &gt; lecture,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but ended up with a wicked stomach virus and had to come home\n&gt; &gt; early.

I forgot to answer: No, I have not given up ghost hunting\n&gt; &gt; at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all, but over the years I have come to focus more on the\n&gt; &gt; collection\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and distribution of experiences than on encountering phenomena\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself. ITC has really affirmed this for me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve felt all along that my job is to make people aware that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual phenomena go on all the time in millions of lives; I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a scientist and I know nothing I do will change the way science\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinks. BUT if I can open the minds of young people today,\n&gt; &gt; perhaps\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our future scientists will make it their business to figure all\n&gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know this is a lot of what ITC experimenters are doing:\n&gt; &gt; convincing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others of the afterlife by their recorded evidence. Amazing\n&gt; &gt; things\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can happen when THAT happens.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, Mark Macy is so wonderful because he has dedicated his\n&gt; &gt; life\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to this. He and his colleagues have received such detailed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; descriptions of how the afterlife works, that they have helped\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; living change their lives to erase the fear of death--and to live\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a way that brings us to as high a spiritual level as possible\n&gt; &gt; right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away when our bodies die. This means, for example, dealing with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issues and addictions, that plague us in life, since the spirits\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tell us we take it all with us! That is, death isn&#39;t a cure-all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any glimpse at the history of ITC shows us that all of this has\n&gt; &gt; been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gradually growing since the 19th century, when state-of-the-art\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; graphite pencils and telegraphs were used to contact the dead.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since then, there have been &quot;breakthroughs&quot; a number of times\n&gt; &gt; when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; astounding floods of messages have come through.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You experimenters are all so incredible--I&#39;m amazed every day at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your love, dedication and faith. Surely something wonderful is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to come from all this, and I think it&#39;s going to come\n&gt; &gt; during\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our lifetimes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ursula\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robin Searcy Henson &lt;MudPuddleFarm@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello Bill,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I did steal that phrase from Ursula because I thought it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; described what I was doing as compared to what I would like to\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I like what you said about focus on the equipment helping to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; establish the psychic connection.

There\n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who believe that communication is between the conscious of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; researcher and the entity and the equipment is secondary. It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get swept up in the technology and forget there is possibly a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; psychic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connection going on. With that said, focusing on equipment\n&gt; &gt; actually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can help the researcher become receptive to establishing a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication link. While paying attention to the equipment,\n&gt; &gt; we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forget\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about the daily distractions and minor irritations that may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prevent us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from establishing contact.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The setting up the gear we use could be considered the first\n&gt; &gt; part of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;ritual&quot;. I like to clear my mind, set up equipment, mess\n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some more, then I am mentally prepare to begin what I hope will\n&gt; &gt; be a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; successful session.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess &quot;random&quot; recording to me would be what happens in the\n&gt; &gt; field\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; during a paranormal investigation. I don&#39;t bring Box\n&gt; &gt; technology\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; location with the intention of possibly contacting lingering\n&gt; &gt; spirits\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at that location but I do bring audio recorders in hopes of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recording\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evp&#39;s.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I find the Box works perhaps even better when I&#39;m in a\n&gt; &gt; familiar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; place\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like the room in my home that is designated for that purpose. I\n&gt; &gt; do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire to have the finest Box technology that is possible but\n&gt; &gt; more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important is the association that seems to occur between the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; researcher and the Box that is favored. Despite some of the\n&gt; &gt; benefits\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the new gear, the one that I seem to have a connection with\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that requires a little more finesse to operate. -Bill\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robin Henson&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;MudPuddleFarm@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wow, thanks for your help guys!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ursula, your post was lovely.
