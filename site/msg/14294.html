  Hi, Just uploaded one =
of my newest "evp" tonight. A little girl gives me a 
  DATE of the year th=
at is important to her. She says "1927" You will need 
  headphones here pe=
ople. I enhanced.... .mainly so you can begin to hear 
  where she will beg=
in to speak. Is not much improvement over the original 
  audio, but serves=
 as a "marker" notification when the background audio gets 
  quiter. She s=
ounds so sweet :) I hope we become friends. The file is in my 
  folder "Ji=
m's RR-DR60 EVP's" the audio is called 
  "important_date_ enhanced_ evp". =
The reason I asked for an important 
  date is so I could PROVE that I wasn=
't just getting some random interferance, 
  or a "natural" spectral record=
ing (the recordings left around locations 
  associated with intense emotio=
ns) I wish I had a way of doing these 
  conversations LIVE. Well at least =
close enough that they wouldn't get bored 
  waiting for me to answer back.=
 This is frustrating :) Don't want to just 
  ramble on here folks. But thi=
s is just awsome!!
