 I'm torqued again! I was told yesterday by ------if ya believe that horse=
 crap,  that what we are getting is 'false communication'. Not only that, t=
hat we are only getting the 'bad guys'. So which is it, false communication=
, which is no commnunication, or is it evil spirits. To make it worse, this=
 idiot implies he has the backing of the -------, and the church believes w=
e are letting evil into the world.    I took this as a severe slap to the f=
ace, very insulting to me, and every paranormal researcher in the world. He=
 claims the 'real voices' he gets are made out of white noise combined with=
 broadcast fragments. Duffus!! That is exactly the kind of voices the livin=
g mind creates to get the voices it wants to hear. Yet only his are the rea=
l voices! My old friend, you can take your 'serious session' and your bisho=
p, and shove 'em.    My apoplogies to the group, but I know this will get f=
orwarded, and this bozo finds me so easy to dismiss, that normal e-mail wou=
ld be useless.   I had to cut some out for nice sakes.   Frank-S
