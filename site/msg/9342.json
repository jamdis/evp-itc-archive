I just did a test on it and I am not \ntotally sure I did the hack right I couldnt find any instructions so \nI just clipped the mute wire. eeeek!!! I still think the AM band is \nsweeping slower than it should it seems to stay one a station longer \nthan it should. I am going to open it back up when I get home and \ntake a second look. \n\nKay\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Marlboro63@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kay,\n&gt;  \n&gt; The am will sweep a little slower which is normal.

It  sweeps both bands fine. Is there any certain rate the \nband \n&gt; should be  sweeping. I noticed that the FM band sweeps faster then \nthe \n&gt; AM  band.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kay\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **************Planning your summer road trip?
