There seems to be a continuum: at each end are people with closed minds who operate from a dogma of philosophy and beliefs. In each case their positions are relatively unshakable. One end is the staunch believer and the other end is what I and others have come to call the &#39;pseudoskeptic&#39;. It is this latter type of person who often labels themselves a &#39;skeptic&#39; and who tries to argue from what they term positions of &#39;logic&#39;, say they are &#39;critical thinkers&#39; and demand &#39;evidence&#39; placing their faith in their version of &#39;science&#39;. All of these terms are of their own definition and are maleable depending on the situation. In the center of this spectrum are what I think of as the true and only &#39;open-minded critical thinkers&#39;. I suppose one could label these individuals as &#39;skeptics&#39; but this kind of clouds the issue. I am sad to say that I really believe the size of this third group is well under 1/3 of everyone. Just my opinion of course.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In my mind the word &quot;skeptic&quot; is a misnomer. There is a difference between a\n&gt; skeptic and an unbeliever.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I said &quot;I&#39;m skeptical about your rebuilding that engine&quot; I would admit\n&gt; that it&#39;s possible, just doubt that you&#39;re going to do it.  An unbeliever\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t believe that it&#39;s even possible to rebuild engines.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think most of the &quot;skeptics&quot; we see in any sort of paranormal sphere are\n&gt; really unbelievers. As Frank pointed out, they don&#39;t even believe or\n&gt; recognize that we ARE spirits, so how could a ghost exist and how could the\n&gt; box work? A ghost could hit them in the head with a 2X4 and they still\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t believe it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Oct 2, 2009 at 3:22 AM, ourobouros2k2 &lt;ourobouros2k2@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Not to mention that when they want to &quot;test&quot; something they are already\n&gt; &gt; skeptical about, then they will come up with impossible criteria. The day I\n&gt; &gt; finally stopped caring why a ghost box worked and just accepted that it did\n&gt; &gt; was the start of rewarding sessions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think most of us are beyond the point where skeptics can make a dent in\n&gt; &gt; our searching for answers. Skepticism can be good, but sometimes it can be\n&gt; &gt; self defeating. More people just want to make a name for themselves by\n&gt; &gt; trying to be the one that brought down this or that device. If they would\n&gt; &gt; try some of these methods with an open mind and a brief suspension of\n&gt; &gt; disbelief, then they might get their own rewarding experiences as well...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Andy\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well then, just build youself a box and test the hell out of it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve said all along that one has to be careful not to create the\n&gt; &gt; voices/answers one wants to hear. We are, despite appearances, spirit, and\n&gt; &gt; we can create our own spirit voices just as easy as any other entity. But\n&gt; &gt; what do I know, I just make the damn boxes and I don&#39;t even believe in ghost\n&gt; &gt; hunting!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whatever these brainiacs claim that want to do all this testing--they\n&gt; &gt; never-ever ask the freaking inventors! They can&#39;t even get their heads\n&gt; &gt; around EVPmaker, so pretend that doesn&#39;t even exist, even though the box\n&gt; &gt; came later. Probably they think it would be easier to disprove the box. Some\n&gt; &gt; duffus puts a DR. in front of his name and I&#39;m supposed to be impressed, it\n&gt; &gt; just means all intellect has been programmed out. After all , they &quot;know&quot;\n&gt; &gt; there are no spirits, so it has to be something else--anything else!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
