<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Snow,

As usual, i don&#x27;t hear any of these.  Maybe, it&#x27;s only your clips that i can&#x27;t hear.  Could be &quot;they&quot; block my hearing when it comes to your files as a etheral joke.

&gt; Here&#x27;s a few more, on that one part where they talk about Jerusalem, they  
&gt; are referring to the &quot;coffins being those in hell&quot;  buried in the way of  
&gt; the doors of the old city where JC is going to open the doors, he would need 
&gt; to  raise the dead there first in order to pass through into Old Jerusalem.   
&gt; It&#x27;s an old saying, the Messiah cannot pass the dead in the valley between 
&gt; MT of  olives and the city wall until the dead are raised.  Most of these 
&gt; are  reverse type files too, I didn&#x27;t have time to revere them, they have 
&gt; words in  sentences, on each side.  Most of the spirit&#x27;s are talking to each 
&gt; other,  it seems they think you are ignoring them, they are saying that you 
&gt; won&#x27;t talk  to them, and some are upset with you.
