Hi Mike. Yeah I took a few minutes to replay it and record from the video a couple of the clips I heard audibly during first run. I heard more maybe upload those later. I have my own files I need to analyze hehehe
   
  I will copy this to your email so you get the attached files because your group settings are set to no email which means you wont get file attachments thru group email.

          Hi Misty,

Oh my.. no I didn't hear my name... but I wasn't listening. I'll 
have to go back and listen.

I will be posting another video very soon, probably early this week 
sometime. I'll talk about it more on my 2 hour internet radio show 
tomorrow. At http://www.blogtalkradio.com/ufogeek (7PM Mountain time)

It will be a video of me using the modified radios as part of a 
complete "Ghost-Box-Like" system. My Spiricomp Mark IV, I guess for 
a namesake, a bit different from the original Spiricom Mark IV 
(notice the play on words... since my system uses a computer 
the "comp" instead of "com" in Spiricomp.

I will use 3 components of "raw" audio that entities can use to voice 
out, as Frank said earlier. (Sweeping AM, sweeping FM and sweeping 
TV, from my 3 modified RS digital radios.)

Those 3 sources of "raw" audio will be fed into a mixer, along with a 
microphone into the mixer. The output will be fed into a laptop 
running an audio capture program capable of level trigger recording.

A person could start a session, ask a question, and after the 
question set the program to listen to the sources of raw audio for a 
set amount of time after the question is asked. The program is 
adjustable to allow for time-frame deviation after the microphone 
level goes to a low peak.

This all gets recorded (session questions and entities answers) into 
a .wav file which could be given to a person after the session is 
finished. The session could be as long as you like.

The .wav file could then be burned onto a CD right after the session 
is done. The person could walk away from that session with the 
entire session on the CD for their record and to listen to at their 
leisure.

The input levels, trigger level, and time frame to allow an answer 
are all set by the person running the session. Its all automated 
after the initial setup. And it's all portable, no AC plug in 
needed. Batteries run everything!

Kinda cool I think!

Anyway, I'll post that video of my complete setup and a mock session 
this week sometime. This way people can get an idea of how they can 
use the modified radios.

Take care...

- Mike
