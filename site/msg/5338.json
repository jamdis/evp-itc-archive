It does not \nnecessarily have to be the voice \n&gt; they had in the physical, but I believe if they create the same \nvoice during communication it is\n&gt; a validation to us on the receiving end that we are in fact \nspeaking to our counterpart and not a deceiving\n&gt; entity that may be negative in manner.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Also my tech&#39;s do not 100% of the time have the correct signal to \ncreate the recognizable voice and do \n&gt; answer or speak in a different or combined voice. When that occurs \nthey tend to reassure the researcher \n&gt; with a comfortable feeling and you instinctively know after a \ncertain period of communicating with the same \n&gt; tech/guide that it is in fact them that are speaking on the other \nhand you will also get a strange gut reaction \n&gt; when it is not them speaking. That is the best way I know how to \nexplain it as I have come to understand it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I hope it helps further your knowledge of the tech/researcher \nrelationship.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: leongbabe@...: Sat, 12 Jan 2008 04:07:48 \n+0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Male and female voices joined to create \none response?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Juli,Thanks for your input -- this is interesting -- could it be \nthat Mike and Lisa use these fragments in conjunction with psycho-\nkinesis in order to modify the tone of these fragments to sound as \ntheir own voices would have sounded when they were alive? We know \nthey don&#39;t have vocal cords, and so they probably communicate via \nsome kind of thought/mind process ... Not to say that all the \nentities employ this method, maybe some of the more identifiable ones \nlike Mike and Lisa.I love mulling over things and this will keep me \nmulling for quite a long time.Sharon the Muller--- In EVP-\nITC@yahoogroups.com, juli velazquez &lt;ghostchasingfool@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; \nBruce, you may want to also add that when they wait for those \nfragments they are in fact Mike and Lisa&#39;s voice not just any male or \nfemale voice.

I believe they try to answer &gt; in the apropriate gender \nso that I &gt; &gt; don&#39;t get confused about who is answering. Sometimes I \nwill get a &gt; response or message that is made &gt; &gt; up of both male and \nfemale voices together, even in the same word &gt; sometimes but very \nrarely.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And I think when that occurs it&#39;s because they lose \nthe particular &gt; fragment midstream and pick up &gt; &gt; whatever is \navailable at that instant to complete the message , &gt; word or \nphrase.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this answers your question and please keep \nasking them. It &gt; forces me to formulate an answer&gt; &gt; and you to \nfurther your knowledge as a researcher.

My guess \n&gt; is that we hear predominantly male voices because they&#39;re more male \n&gt; radio announcers. Therefore, does the entity who announces herself \nto &gt; you as Lisa come through with a male voice at times (because \nthose &gt; are the voices that she gets most of the time to formulate a \n&gt; response)? Please tell me if my reasoning here is way off &gt; \nbase...Thanks,Sharon--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-&gt; \nITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Hello,&gt; &gt; This email message is a &gt; \nnotification to let you know that&gt; a file has been uploaded to the &gt; \nFiles area of the EVP-ITC &gt; group.&gt; &gt; File : /*Bruce RS files_1-2-&gt; \n08/7B_WE DON&#39;T HAVE THE RIGHT SIGNAL FOR CONTROLING THAT.wav &gt; &gt; \nUploaded by : bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; &gt; Description : &gt; \n7B_WE DON&#39;T HAVE THE RIGHT SIGNAL FOR CONTROLING THAT.wav &gt; &gt; You can \n&gt; access this file at the URL:&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-&gt; \nITC/files/%2ABruce%20RS%20files_1-2-08/7B_WE%20DON%27T%20HAVE%20THE%&gt; \n20RIGHT%20SIGNAL%20FOR%20CONTROLING%20THAT.wav &gt; &gt; To learn more &gt; \nabout file sharing for your group, please visit:&gt; &gt; \nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htm\n&gt; lfiles&gt; &gt; Regards,&gt; &gt; bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n__________________________________________________________&gt; &gt; Get the \npower of Windows + Web with the new Windows Live.&gt; &gt; \nhttp://www.windowslive.com?&gt; \nocid=TXT_TAGHM_Wave2_powerofwindows_012008&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The \ncontents of this eletronic correspondence is private & confidential \nand meant only for the party and/or parties it is addressed to. &gt; &gt; \nNo part of this email transmission may be publicly posted or \nforwarded to other parties without explicit written permission.&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get the power of Windows + Web with the new Windows Live.\n&gt; http://www.windowslive.com?\nocid=TXT_TAGHM_Wave2_powerofwindows_012008\n&gt;"}
