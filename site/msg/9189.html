Margaret,
 
In my initial reply I voiced my disdain for low lives that tak=
e advantage of unwary people
but did not advocate any action by any researc=
hers on this board.
 
My goal is not just pacifism for it's own sake, belie=
ve me any of the old timers here can attest to my temper.
My concern is for=
 the negative disruption in the energy flow of the communication.
I think t=
hat following the example of "turn the other cheek" will be very well recei=
ved on the other side and therefore 
contribute to strengthening the bridge=
.
 
In the past couple of days I know Kristin has received messages about t=
he seven and the circle, 
these are metaphors for peace, harmony and cooper=
ation of energies within the communication.
 
It is not the first time we h=
ave received messages with these examples, I personally have received numer=
ous 
messages pertaining to circle, circles and the power of seven. It has =
been contemplated in length here more than once.
 
I have, through interpre=
tation of communication over a long period of time, come to PERSONALLY beli=
eve that the urgence of 
harmony and positive energy is the fertilizer of t=
he growth of our communication with the spirit world.
 
I'm sorry, I drifte=
d off the subject at hand, but my reason is relevant to this commentary. 
T=
aking any action against this ebay fool will first and foremost serve our e=
go's and secondly
may help to provide information to unwary buyers that is =
contrary to what this thief is putting out.
 
But could that not be accompl=
ished through other venues that would help to educate many more people that=

are would be box researchers and do not look to ebay as a source for an RS=
 hack. But are seeking general knowledge.
 
And Margaret to thine own self =
be true, when this was brought up my first reaction was to figure out a way=
 to sabotage
this guy's business venture. After thinking it over and asking=
 myself what the first reason for doing that would be. My answer
Was, to ge=
t this asshole that is exploiting something that I hold very dear, and in t=
urn help to steer unaware buyers away from getting screwed.
 
But still my =
initial and primal reason was to inflict some sort of punishment on a perso=
n that I felt was unscrupulous. And I decided that this was
a negative emot=
ion and would generate negative energy, no matter how I tried to convince m=
yself it was in the name of justice.
 
That goes without even mentioning th=
e fact that we are not the say all and do all of this research. There are o=
ther entities involved that I would think 
have better influential power th=
an we do. If they want it stopped they will find a way to stop it. I know w=
hat your going to say, maybe we are the 
tools they are using to stop this =
injustice. That may very well be, and if so then that is the way it will pl=
ay out.
 
I think you mistake what I am implying. I am not saying do nothin=
g, quite the opposite. It is actually our duty to do something. All I'm say=
ing is there 
are alternative ways to educate unwary possible researchers t=
hat would be 100% positive and not entail any type of stone throwing tactic=
s.
 
I have said my piece now at the expense of boring everyone to death. S=
o I will see how this unfolds, and during my daily session will inquire abo=
ut how our friends feel about it.

Hi Bruce. I don't see this so much as an assau=
lt on anyone, as it is simply bringing awareness into a forum (ebay) where =
it is desperately needed. Was it not you who recently stated sellers who ta=
ke advantage of others in this way are "no more than thieves without guns" =
and "should not be patronized no matter the circumstances." You have charac=
terized them as "wolves" and "demons" but now are saying "do nothing." Whic=
h, honestly, I could understand if my suggestion was coming from a place of=
 vengeance. It is not.THIS IS ABOUT EDUCATION FIRST AND FOREMOST, and stand=
ing up for those who are, unknowingly, being taken advantage of. The byprod=
uct of providing this education will be allowing consumers to make an infor=
med decision and if that hurts the sales of unscrupulous sellers, then so b=
e it. Ann has just echoed some of my remarks in earlier posts in support of=
 sellers rights to take advantage of the market ... that some people may fi=
nd it's worth it to pay more to someone to receive a previously hacked unit=
. I would venture to guess, this educational information will A) help preve=
nt those who are capable of doing the hack themselves from being duped, and=
 B) force sellers who do offer pre-hacked units to do so for a more 'reason=
able' fee. This is neither spiteful nor aggressive, and it's certainly not =
any kind of vengeance driven on my part. It's standing up for the uninforme=
d, leveling the playing field for sellers, and it's bringing more people th=
e knowledge that doing 'box' research is not an exclusive club that only th=
e rich can take part in (and given the pricing on the bids for these units,=
 people are under the false assumption that you have a pay a high price to =
get your hands on a limited resource, when that simply is not the case.)I c=
