<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m not trying to dismiss them, believe me. They were/are a pain in  
the ass. Major pain--check. Demons of EVP--I think that&#x27;s granting  
them too much. And it&#x27;s a title they would revel in. Nasty clever  
little punks--yeah, that&#x27;s about right.

&gt; I know they liked to have drove Erland crazy. They tend to pick on  
&gt; those listening to low level evp - those people who, in the  
&gt; beginning listen a lot and try to dig voices out of anything they  
&gt; record instead of just the Class A&#x27;s. They seem to really like  
&gt; people suffering deep grief as they can really have a party with  
&gt; them and convince them they are their &quot;dead&quot; child, relative,  
&gt; etc... I know a few AAEVP members who have tangled with them.
&gt;
&gt; They are often referred to as &#x27;&#x27;The Demons of EVP&quot;.
