It used to be that you could privately contact a person bidding (which I have \ndone many times in the past), and give them information if you thought they were being \ntaken advantage of.  But due to so many scammers contacting bidders privately, eBay now \nhides the identity of those bidding, and as well, has disabled the ability to send them any \nmessages.  \n\nTo leave feedback on eBay, you have to have bought something from that person.  \nObviously, if someone has a site, they have control over it and would likely remove any \ntype of comments detrimental to their business.  I like the concept though.  :-)\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Bryan Whatley &lt;bryan_whatley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Geez, I can&#39;t believe people are making these RS hacks to on e-bay!\n&gt; \n&gt; We should all go and leave a bunch of comments on that persons selling site to warn \nbuyers.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; From: bruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt;\n&gt; To: evp-itc@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, April 5, 2008 10:15:21 AM\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] boxes on ebay\n&gt; \n&gt;                 Guy&#39;s\n&gt;  \n&gt; Do not give in to these demons that are trying to make a buck from the research we love \nand the equipment we use.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have given away including the shipping 5 RS boxes for free, 4, 470&#39;s and 1 469 all \nhacked by me.\n&gt; I did not do it to gain popularity or even wanted a thank you. my sole motivation was to \nbring new people into the research and \n&gt; in turn change someones life and perpetuate the idea of strength in numbers, in this \ncase strength of communication.\n&gt;  \n&gt; To all new people on this board, do not patronise these wolves that prey on the needs \nand wants of others. \n&gt; The RS 20 -125 is everything the 470 & 469 are and a little more. do not let the size or \ncomplicated button arrangement scare you off.\n&gt; the hack is as simple as the others. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Do not buy any RS hacks from ebay, they are sold with the wrong energy attached to \nthem, spirit wise.\n&gt; That is why I and all other researchers should follow the example of a great man to \nwhom we owe all of this research.\n&gt; Mr. Frank Sumption, who was in a position at one time to make a substantial amount of \nmoney from his boxes and\n&gt; was offered the opportunity on a silver platter.

If a box is not attainable for a new person yet, the right way.
