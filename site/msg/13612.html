Hi Frank, Jon, and Everybody Else

Thanks for letting me join.  I'm really looking forward to learning more about this approach to capturing EVPs. 

My visit here started with a discussion over at the American Ghost Society investigators' group with a question about the Ovilus (sp?), which I hadn't heard of before.  A Yahoo search later and following assorted links, and here I am.

I learned about the Frank's box last year at the AGS conference when Rosemary Ellen Guiley did a presentation about it.  I have the Radio Shack hack as described in Strange Frequencies.  My team has used it on a few occasions, including one where we feel we were getting valid responses through it.  We've still got a lot more experimenting to do.

One of the things that Rosemary emphasized was that repeated use of a Frank's box in the same location can result in drawing in shadow people.  Frank, you have indicated that you use yours at home.  Does that mean that this hasn't been your experience?

By the way, I don't know how you feel about being a celebrity in our little universe, but it is a pleasure to meet you.

Hypnobarb
