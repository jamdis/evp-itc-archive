<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve seen live webcast of ITC sessions where GB output is fed directly into the mic line in on a computer running Adobe Audition with the spectragraph running. It was really compelling to see letters and numbers, not images or pictures, but partial words appear in the graph. At first it was I thought it was a software glitch but it is a repeatable event. It was on LiveSciFi which is run by Tim Wood, he also thought there was some kind of code error but it happened on more than one webcast. 

So if anyone has Audition, just feed Box output right in your computer and see what happens. I wanted to try it tonight but I have Audacity and the spectragraph feature doesn&#x27;t have that shaded appearance that Audition does so it&#x27;s not able to render images or characters, at least as far as I see using the various settings.

&gt; I have tried numerous EVP files and short box clips and so far
&gt; nothing discernible has appeared on either program.  I still have a lot of
&gt; hope though.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but I am going to try to work this in to a
&gt; session tonight!
