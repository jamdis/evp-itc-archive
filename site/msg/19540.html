IF you go on the website there are videos on the site and because I am a ow=

 this was Wowed! but hey its just my opinion. You can get it or not. I'm ha=

Hello....
I, too, have a Moditronics =
UV/IR Full Spectrum HD Camcorder and a Moditronics Deep IR Still Camera (ma=
de by SVP). I agree that the camcorder is incorrectly named as it is not fu=
ll spectrum. It is the UV and IR fields I am interested in anyway.

Both ar=
e made from low quality, in my opinion, cameras. But whatever the technolog=
y this company uses in their units is very good, and I have yet to see it d=
uplicated. Their deep IR still camera will not pick up dust orbs, for examp=
le. When you get an orb on the still camera, chances are it is something...=
they are often self illuminating, solid or near solid white, often have a t=
ail. I have also gotten very, very few orbs using this camera as well.

I d=
id buy this same SVP camera but modified by a different equipment supplier =
on the internet. It does show every dust orb there is, the picture quality =
is a bit blurry or fuzzy many times. I was very disappointed.

One thing ab=
out the SVP still camera is if you drop it, even once, you will have a brok=
en SD card slot. I was sold one on Ebay from someone who knew the SD card w=
as broken and never revealed it. Some research showed me what the possible =
reason was...it cannot take a drop. So handle it with care. Their packing s=
lip even says they will not warrant the camera against drops. But you proba=
bly won't find that advertised on their web site though.

I found it intere=
sting and somewhat amusing that Ghost Hunters on tv showed up with this equ=
ipment in their series. However the Moditronics label was ripped off, the g=
lue was still on the camera and there was a zoom in to this portion of one =
of the cameras.

In regards to the spectercams, in this economy and with th=
e infrequency that I investigate, I cannot justify spending what any of the=
 spectercams go for. If I were going out to investigate every week or every=
 other week, then sure I could justify spending more money. But I would be =
nervous without having more reviews from users and especially those that ha=
ve caught something on the Spectercam.

Hope this helps,
CB
