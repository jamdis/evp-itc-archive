Ann, you are not alone.

I have felt the same at times, but don't give up.=
  I found that many
times I am trying too hard to hear.  You must remain pa=
tient and allow
time for the spirit(s) to come through after turning the de=
vice on.  In
other words, let it sweep a bit.

When they did come through f=
or me, I began hearing word bits and then
getting replies to questions.  It=
 is almost like it changes to the
trained ear, when it is manipulated.  You=
 may try making recordings at
first and then playing them back a few times.=
  You might find you have
been missing someone talking to you - happened to=
 me.

Hope this helps...just my take on things.
