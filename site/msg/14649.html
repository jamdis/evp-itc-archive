<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>LOL Frank I sent ya a &quot;funny&quot; email today about something similar. You are right. I think its not the people who are promoting the subject of ITC and others working in the feild we have to worry about so much as the big egos who are only trying to promote &quot;themselves&quot; by whatever way possible. I cant say I blame ya for straying from the spotlight Frank, when theres so many out there who will step on others, drag them down, claw, lie, and cheat thier way into making a name for themselves. They try to get boxes from you then talk bad about you or your work until the point comes where its good for the ego to say &quot;frank is a friend of mine&quot; to promote themselves or gather listeners.

If it looks like a rat, smells like a rat, talks like a rat, acts like a rat...then the likely conclusion is it is indeed the rat. A rose by any other name is still a rose and the same goes for that which doesnt smell right. 

So many people in this do whatever they can to tear others down rather than concentrate on the ITC and paranormal then wonder why they get banned/removed from groups like this or why they are spending most of thier time consumed by hate mails, and ripping each other apart rather than focusing on the thing that got them started doing it in the first place. They dont even get along with the people they call friends most of the time LOL

Nope not dumb at all just more focused on the right side of the subject at hand.

&gt;  Yeah, real interesting, if ya know something about these various &quot;players&quot;
&gt; in the field. Yet they wonder why I don&#x27;t play those &quot;do my show&quot; games. A
&gt; certain amount here left unsaid, so not too many will get it.
