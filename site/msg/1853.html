<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You might try ExpressPCB, their minimum is two boards. I&#x27;m working on a 
layout now, it&#x27;s $93 for two boards, of course you have to install the 
parts, and over half of this layout is surface mount, so I can use both 
sides of the board for different functions, and make it smaller for reduced 
cost. These first two are to make it works, and every thing&#x27;s cosher.
You have to draw the layout using their cad software, then e-mail it with 
credit card #.

&gt;hey guy&#x27;s
&gt;here are a couple from the last session. I believe I am having great
&gt;sucess with this method. I am in the process of trying to get a box
&gt;built but the the electronics companies I have contacted seem to be too
&gt;busy to do one board. If I&#x27;m doing so well with this manual sweep I
&gt;can&#x27;t wait to see how a box works out. anyway give a listen and let me
&gt;know what you think.
