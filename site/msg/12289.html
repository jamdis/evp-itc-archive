<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Today was the first run of the brown noise session, I ran for about 10
minutes, and upon review, there were some short contacts, one named
Mike interestingly advised &quot;empty&quot; when I asked what was in my left
hand (he was correct, the item was in my right hand, I simply
misspoke). Today&#x27;s session was abbreviated, I had poor reception for
some reason, the .469 was doing great, but the .120 was only receiving
strongly in FM. On the surface I would say it was a success, I will
have to correlate more sessions with white and pink noise loops to
determine. 

On a more personal note, I find brown/red noise a heckuva lot easier
on the ears since most of the amplitude of the signal is at lower
frequency. Reminds me of a large, fast river as heard from a bank.

thanks,
Andy

&gt; Hi Andy,
&gt; 
&gt; I have mostly worked with the white noise, when I insert any type 
&gt; noise.  Lately I&#x27;ve been going &quot;noiseless&quot; and just letting the audio 
&gt; snippets come through... but when I do use it, I like the white.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess because there is such a history with EVP and white noise.  
&gt; They are like a team from way back.  So many EVP pioneers used it.
&gt; 
&gt; Good idea you have with the DVD and looping track.  Any way you can 
&gt; insert the noise is helpful.
&gt; I haven&#x27;t used any brown or red... how is that working for you?
&gt; 
&gt; And thanks for the kind words...
&gt; - Mike

&gt; &gt; Mike, quick question...I have been experimenting with a multichannel
&gt; &gt; system inspired by your spiricomp system. Rather than adding the 
&gt; white
&gt; &gt; noise at the computer recording stage, I have a standalone dvd 
&gt; player
&gt; &gt; with a looping track. I have experimented with white and pink noise
&gt; &gt; tracks, but was just curious which you have had the most success 
&gt; with.
&gt; &gt; I also made a brown/red noise track, and wondered if you had
&gt; &gt; experimented with that at all. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance, you work has been very helpful in getting me
&gt; &gt; started down this road.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Andy

&gt; &gt; &gt; For those who care to see... I&#x27;ve posted a quick 4 minute video 
&gt; tour of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the EVP and ITC systems I use, with a quick explanation of their 
&gt; setup.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The video is at:
