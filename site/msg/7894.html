<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>-I hear the clay earth part and I think I hear the go back. 
I looked at clip in Audition and it is strange.  The loud portion or
possible fragment is just over three times longer than any other
portion of the clip.  This means it is either very very broad band or
a very powerful transmission.  It is way to long in duration to be
broadband.  The FCC would never let a signal this wide be broadcast. 
And if its that powerful to saturate the front end of the receiver it
would 1, be very close to you and 2, be heard all the time!  I think
the fact that the time period of the signal is so much longer than
that of the scan rate proves this is something else.
I use this method on my minibox and it seems to be holding up.

&gt;  This is kinda light blasted by the sunlight, but it&#x27;s direct mode,
no sound chamber, and using the lool antenna. There is one loud voice
in the middle &quot;go back to the clay earth&quot;--or &quot;go back the player&quot; a
broadcast frag?
