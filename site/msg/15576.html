I agree with Shane. That was a great talk Frank S and Bill M.! I'd also lik=
e to thank Steve and Kristin for sharing some of your EVP results with them=
 to use on the show. Those were some=A0good examples of=A0Frank's box=A0and=
 the sweep tuning method. 
=A0
I love it when people in this group work tog=
ether towards our common goal. It's a wonderful example of teamwork and tre=
ating this research (and each other) with honesty and dignity, instead of s=
ome of the egotistical lies and deciet thats=A0being spread=A0around out th=
ere. It helps=A0maintain focus and a better perspective on this subject. Gr=
eat job everyone!
