<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Steve,

You&#x27;re right... so I&#x27;ve added your accomplishments as a note under 
that blog history entry you saw. Right under the 24 Nov 2007 date 
event.

http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/2008/10/move-over-franks-box-radio-
shack-hack.html

By-the-way:
I&#x27;ve got the new version of the 12-470 (black case) torn apart on my 
bench again.  I know I failed to get it hacked the first time (last 
year), but I figured I&#x27;d try it again.  It is totally different than 
the others... and they have made sure you can&#x27;t tell what the radio 
chip is by getting rid of the markings and covering both sides of the 
circuit board with a waxy substance. I&#x27;ve been carefully scraping it 
away. The chip is a 30 pin device, possibly a KK22425 or KK22426 or 
equivilent.
The mute pin for the #25 is pin 2 but looking at the connection 
scheme itmight not be the right one.
I guess I&#x27;ll mess with it until I break it... or ???

I&#x27;ll put some pictures of the new 12-470 circuit board in my photo 
area of this froum.

&gt; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; You forgot to mention that i was the first to do the hack after 
Bill 
&gt; and post files that same day.  I also stumbled across 3 other RS 
&gt; radios that i hacked (12-820, 20-125, 12-150) to share with other 
&gt; researchers.  A mention would have been nice in your blog, but you 
&gt; contribute a lot of time too and we all appreciate it.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Last night on Haunted Times Magazine radio , guest Brian Harnois 
&gt; (Ghost
&gt; &gt; Hunters International) told the radio listening audience that he 
&gt; didn&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; think anyone should use a Franks&#x27; Box, (or a ghost box is what he 
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; insinuating) unless they had training from Christopher Moon.
&gt; &gt; So... that is the topic of my blog write-up this morning if you 
&gt; care to
&gt; &gt; read it.
