I have to admit that I thought I had seen the=
 worst 'paranormal' show on television already. I was wrong. Door to the De=
ad has exceeded my worst expectations.
=A0
Generally, I respect John Oliver=
's work as a medium. While I have no personal experience with him, in the p=
ast he has looked and acted more genuine than not, the rolling of the eyes =
put aside for the moment.
=A0
I do take exception to the characterization o=
f the talking box as an Edison device. I have documented the history of Edi=
son, ITC and EVP=A0=A0elsewhere. This is however the smallest concern I hav=
e with this show.
=A0
Prior to wathcing I had just had a conversation with =
a respected colleague on the West coast regarding interesting phenomena he =
and others are constantly observing in sites with phenomena similar to that=
 on Door to the Dead. None of those measurements were made by this team. Th=
e use of thermal in this situation is not indicated as well.
=A0
The real c=
oncern is that no attempt was made to help this family in a broader context=
. The skeptic did and said nothing skeptical as far as I could tell. Key qu=
estions were not asked (at least on-camera) that would reveal the psycho-dy=
namics of this family. We know fairly well at this time that PK phenomena i=
s often centered on a focal person who can exhibit specific characteristics=
. That the team seems unaware of this is quite disturbing to a person like =
myself.

A real research opportunity was lost in this case, as was an op=
portunity to educate the public on the right way to approach such situation=
s. Continually sending the messages that phenomena is based on 'demons' and=
 'spirits' exclusively does nothing to further the position of serious inve=
stigators, which is perhaps most troubling of all.
