I used \nquartz crytals, not as part of any circuits or for frequency, some of \nthe &quot;contacts&quot; request the crystals, so I place them on, or in sound \nchamber, it seems to help with some entities, as do magents used in \nthe same way. There&#39;s no way to conect them to the circuit.\n\n I used radio modules from car stereos because they were already \ndesigned to be volatage tuned, so I could use the random voltage \ngenerator to tune these moudules randomly. Following EVPmaker as an \nexample, I had thought the tuning had to be random, as I thought \nthere was somekind of quantum resonance going on to get the voices. \nThat assumption has proved to be false, a linear scan is far superior \nto random scan. I don&#39;t care what the &quot;primary tester&quot; claims, he \ndoesn&#39;t make the things. I still don&#39;t know how the voices are made. \n\n We&#39;ve also found anyone can do the same thing as a box by manually \ntuning a radio across it&#39;s band slowly by hand while recording. It&#39;s \neasier to have the precess automated, but the manual method is good \nfor quickie messages and guidence when needed. You wouldn&#39;t want to \nget hooked on doing sessions to ask about every little thing in your \nlife though. \n\n Personally, I don&#39;t have all these higher ideals, asperations, or \ngoals as some seem to claim in the paranormal field. I don&#39;t insist \nonly the higher beings coming through with only the blessing of some \ndeity--I don&#39;t care what talks. I get some cussing and name calling --\nsometimes, but big deal! It does in fact show it&#39;s not broadcast \nfragments. As for portals some claim opened--I don&#39;t even know what \nthey are talking about, I have never experienced a portal--or \nanything that might be considered evil--except perhaps some of the \nliving. I can&#39;t imagine box use being anymore dangerous than watching \nto much TV, and taking every show as gospel truth. Wonder how many \nlive their lives by what&#39;s on Friends, or Saturday Night Live!? 90% \nor more of what I get is just my familar guys, my unseen friends, \ntalking, mostly very non-profound comments. I get some relatives, my \nson, and dad, maybe an uncle from time to time, I don&#39;t take it like \nit&#39;s all profound and mystical, it&#39;s just communcations--ya don&#39;t \nhave to worship it, and you don&#39;t need some guru to interpret it! I \ndon&#39;t know how many can hear this stuff rihgt away, it might take \npractice, since the voices are composites of various voices and music \nbits mixed with radio noise. \n The function of the box is to provide the &quot;raw&quot; audio which &quot;they&quot; \nuse to form a voice. It is not the only way, there are many method \nthat work as well, and at times better. \n\n As far as antenna, I just use a piece of wire and an Rf amplifier, I \ndon&#39;t care about resonating for each frquency, that would be very \ncumbersome, and useless. Imagine a car with 10,000 antennas sticking \nout it! Even on ham radio I have one 100 foot long dipole I use on \nall hf bands, and talk all over the world on less than 5 watts. Of \ncourse I use an antenna tuner to resonate it for the band I&#39;m on. I \nalso haven&#39;t been on the air since starting EVP, it eats all my time!\n\n It&#39;s only the audio that I consider important, radio is a convenient \nsource of a mix of speech, music and noise that can be chopped up \neasily by tuning. There is a program that does this on the computer, \ncalled EVPmaker, and my boxes were an analog version of EVPmaker. I \nam still curious why some spirits seems unable to use the computer \nmethod, which lead to my boxes by asking waht else could I use?\n\n Frank-s"}
