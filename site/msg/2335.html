<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ive thought about this a long time ago. I know that in the non-
physical or, whatever you would want to call existing only in 
consciousness and not physically, that time and space do not exist. 
So when you think about it like that no matter where you go in the 
physical world the connections you have to some that communicate 
with you will still be there as physicalities doesnt make a 
difference. So I would say that perhaps the majority you get will 
still be in english no matter where in the world you are. However I 
am sure that you will get some in the common language of the country 
you go to. You just never know who will be interested in 
communicating with you. Regards,
                              T.L.

&gt; It would be intriguing and awesome to witness someone in their 
native tongue having a discussion with them. One of my major 
interests are evps in other languages. Say in Thailand, do they come 
across in Thai, or in English?

&gt;         Frank,
&gt;   When native americans come across, or when people of other 
ethnic regions come across, do they speak in their native tongue?

I&#x27;d send it to him, but there&#x27;s about zero chance of it being 
recieved, or listend to, as most of these people tend &quot;know better&quot;.
