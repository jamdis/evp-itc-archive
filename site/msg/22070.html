Subject: [EVP-ITC] EVP

=C2=A0 
Ment to add my experience with a=
n EVP using a mini recorder. My friend actually 
recorded it.

She has been=
 experiencing cabinets opening and closing at night and some other 
noises =
(footsteps). One night recently she left the recorder on and you can hear 
=
her snoring (wow, she snores LOUD!). We heard what sounded like a deep wail=
ing 
voice saying "I want you! I want you!" then "I want my mommy!". At the=
 very 
beginning it said "Are you my mommie?". It was rather scary and the =
voice 
sounded like it was crying.

In rewinding it to get it to play over =
and over again we accidently hit the 
speed button (faster) and suddenly we=
 heard a child!! saying/crying those words!

It was heartbreaking! There ar=
e no children in that apartment nor any on either 
side (these are block ap=
artment, only four single level ones.

I have never heard such a clear EVP.=
 This is on a micro tape and have no idea 
how to transfer it to a computer=
 file but would love for someone here to hear 
it.

Has anyone here ever ha=
d an experience like this? Wish there was something we 
could do to ease th=
is spirits agony. The child sounds like maybe 2 or 3 years 
old at the most=
. Could this be an "imprint" type of energy? The only thing makes 
me doubt=
 this are the words "Are you my mommie?".
