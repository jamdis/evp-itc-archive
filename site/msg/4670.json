We&#39;re not extremely talented in the\nelectronics area, but we have fun and seem to muddle by. No guts no\nglory, huh?\n\nWell, for the most part the operation has been a success. I\nphotographed every step of the way and taped screws and parts to the\nphotos so we&#39;d know how to rebuild everything we took apart, and that\nhas worked just fine. I located the IR filter, removed it and cut and\nreplaced it with a piece of glass slide. \n\nThe one problem we ran into is that there were two wires that appeared\nto be clipped in place as opposed to being soldered or screwed in like\neverything else. When we tried to pry the clips open, instead the\nwhole thing came off the circuit board. WE HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO PROCEED\nFROM HERE. I don&#39;t know if we can just glue the darn things down and\nif so, what type of glue to use, or if we&#39;re just plain up the creek.\n\nI immediately thought of this group of brainy electronics buffs. I&#39;m\nhoping someone out there can give us some advice, or if you live near\nHighlands Ranch, CO, you could help in person & bail us out of this. I\nwas hoping to take this camera to the St. Augustine Lighthouse at the\nend of this coming week.\n\nIs there any hope? I&#39;ve posted a photo of an extreme closeup of the\nclips (one is pink, the other is ivory) and the damaged board -- I had\nto sandwich two photos together to get both in focus at the same time\n(that&#39;s why it looks that way). For an idea of scale, the clips are\nboth the same size, about 4 mm in width, 4 mm tall, 3 mm deep. Not\neasy to handle and even harder to see with these middle age eyes.\nhttp://www.tejadadesign.com/camera/splice.jpg\n\nAny advice would be GREATLY APPRECIATED!!  Deb T."}
