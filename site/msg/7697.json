She sold my mom&#39;s house and property and gave her stuff to goodwill...and she had the nerve to tell me via informal and rather rude email that my mom passed and what a burden it was to her the past few months taking care of her.  I know my mom knows that I loved her and will always...but I dont know if she knows what my sister did to keep me from her and I feel like a horrible daughter...not getting to see her before she passed.  I finally got her address and phone number in a christmas card she sent me and I was able to call her for like 10 mins before she had to go eat...and when I tried calling back that night and several times after I only got her machine.  I wanted to go see her but didnt have a way to get all the way to where she was...not even the public buses run to\n where the nursing home was.\n   \n  Ive tried doing some EVPs to see if there was a chance of contacting her...I know ya dont usully get what ur looking for...but Ive gotten nothing at all.  So Im wondering....is there anyone who has done a skype session for this type of situation and gotten any success?  And would you be willing to do a skype session with me?(Tho I have no idea how that would even work, Id be willing to try...heck just to be able to listen to a session would be awesome)  \n   \n  Thanks,\n  Rhonda\n\n       \n---------------------------------\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
