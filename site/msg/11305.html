<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks. I&#x27;m not sure it means anything, just seems like everytime I 
see those circles, there&#x27;s tornados/windstorms.

&gt; That&#x27;s cool lookin, or maybe not.  I never heard of death 
clouds before.  I hope they don&#x27;t float our way!  Cool pic

&gt;  I see &#x27;death&#x27; clouds like this before just aobut every 
natural disaster, most of the time they are much clear, and look like 
shulls. Oftne they appear only as th eeye sockets from the skulls. 
It&#x27;s almost as easy to catch these in pix as it is to get UFOs. Right 
after this I heard about another fatality int a tornado. Thre 
sky has been full of these clouds this year. 
&gt;  
&gt;  There is also frequently symbols, some almost look like 
Mayan, but I don&#x27;t understand them. I think the whole universe tries 
to communicate in whatever is available.
