<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I didn&#x27;t hear it until you just posted it.  Was this part of a larger file?
I&#x27;m learning how to slow and filter the voices so I can understand them so
I&#x27;m curious.  Did you slow this one down or filter it so you could hear the
words?    Thx for posting it.

&gt;  Since no one seems to have heard this one, I wonder if you all were able
