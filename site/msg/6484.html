&gt; Sorry to bug you guys but I got zero reply to this email from a few  
&gt; days ago.  I acknowleged that working on one word is a triffle but  
&gt; at this early stage of my testing it would be really important to  
&gt; me have someone else confirm...or not...what I think I hear.  This  
&gt; one word recording is also found in my files.   Thanks   Ron L

&gt; Ron,
&gt;
&gt; I wish you had a folder with your files (and this one uploaded into
&gt; it, too), as I do not get the e-mails due to there being too many of
&gt; them. Thus, I cannot hear your recording.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry...

&gt; &gt; I recorded this with a RS 469 patched direct into by handheld
&gt; recorder. I hear a two sylable word over the background noise.
&gt; Hoping I can get some help from the group to define the word or
&gt; words. Thanks Ron L
