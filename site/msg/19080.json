I agree with you wholly that they are ready to transmit.  Multiple\nITC researchers have intimated that they have transmission stations on the\nother side.  This was even documented by Raudive&#39;s EVP&#39;s 40 years ago.  I am\nquite convinced that they do gather and a technician wrangles them.  I have\nnumerous clips of a technician reiterating my words to the Others and I also\nhave numerous clips of a technician telling them to some up and talk.\n\nI wish I could see how they have it set-up over there.  What baffles me is\nwhy they need equipment to contact us, let alone how their equipment is\nbuilt and used.  It seems as if their world is a physical one just like\nours.  Macy reported this years ago and I dismissed it then, but now I am\nslowly reconsidering what he has said.  But I have yet to get a clear answer\non what their environment is like when I ask or how they can talk to us.\n The closest I got was &quot;bending energy.&quot;\n\nTim\n\nOn Sun, Oct 24, 2010 at 2:49 PM, Frank Sumption\n&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  [Attachment(s) &lt;#12bdf93b6cc86be1_TopText&gt; from Frank Sumption included\n&gt; below]\n&gt;\n&gt;  Even when doing the test videos, I just announce out loud I&#39;m doing an EVP\n&gt; recording. Even with these it&#39;s like they are right there and ready. There\n&gt; seems to be some, or a group that actually transmit something, and\n&gt; participants stand in front of, or use a mic of somekind. When I first\n&gt; started, box #1, &quot;they&quot; had Lincoln, and were showing him how to use the\n&gt; mic. Chicken skin just thinking about it!\n&gt;\n&gt;  Like this one, starts out &quot;you don&#39;t believe&quot; sung, I think it&#39;s a\n&gt; remodulated song from Radio Disney. I try to explain to them, I look in a\n&gt; mirror, and that ain&#39;t alien Princess looking back! It&#39;s a difficult\n&gt; concept.
