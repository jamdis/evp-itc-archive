<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t know the new digital stuff like sumra does. I&#x27;m hoping to 
stop building all these boards for awhile next year, and learn the 
new technology.

&gt; Lc,
&gt;  
&gt; When the hacks first came out and sum duc was still around and 
active we had asked him to attempt to hack the
&gt; new model of the 470 but he had no luck in doing so and told me 
that it would probably need an extra chip to 
&gt; be capable of sweeping. I would think that the next likely person 
to try would be either frank s. or mike c.
&gt;  
&gt; I know frank is swamped with other thing and I&#x27;m sure mike is also 
but he may give it a try when he has the time.
&gt; until then we have to drive on with what we have.

&gt; Mike, Have you tried modifying the newest model of the 12-470 or 
has anyone else tried to do so? I know it has a wire bundle of some 
sort inside, but I returned the one I had mistakenly opened up early 
on.Anyone else tried to mod it?LC
