<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce,

Don&#x27;t apologize, you&#x27;re not being rude or nuts. I tend to take  
everything with a salt lick anyway.

Actually I&#x27;m quite aware of the conflict and the parties involved!  
Individual #1 lives, coincidentally, within walking distance of my  
home and I&#x27;m grateful to him for acting (unbeknownst to him) as a sort  
of conduit or spring board to other connections and paths for me. I  
can see what his motivation is, and its quite different from most of  
the people who are interested in this sort of stuff. He&#x27;s a business  
man and he&#x27;s trying to protect his golden goose.

Hopefully most people can see this. ;=&gt;

Deb

&gt; You know why chip laughed when you mentioned the chosen 30
&gt; because he knows it&#x27;s a bunch of bull that was totaly made up.
&gt;
&gt; you are new to this group so you have no way of knowing but
&gt; not to long ago there was a burning fued between some individuals on  
&gt; this group
&gt; and the individual who claims there are only thirty people.
&gt;
&gt; please excuse me if I sound rude nut I won&#x27;t mention this again.

&gt; Thanks Bruce, I&#x27;ll certainly need some answers once I get started
&gt; digging thru the posts more. I&#x27;m tempted to do the Shack Hack, I&#x27;ve
&gt; seen Frank&#x27;s Box in use a few times in person and can&#x27;t quite get the
&gt; knack for understanding the messages yet. I need some practice! I ran
&gt; into Chip Coffee earlier this month, he&#x27;s supposedly one of the few
&gt; &quot;chosen&quot; people who are supposed to be able to work with it. I asked
&gt; him how it felt to be one of the &quot;chosen ones&quot; and he laughed.
