<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Juli,

you are well on your way to becoming a fine and valuable researcher.

As a new researcher just having the guts to post your results for 
critique is proof enough that you have what it takes. Stick with it 
and if I can help in any way please don&#x27;t hesitate to call on me.

That&#x27;s what we are here for to help one another, every new researcher 
that has success and sticks with it helps to solidify the strength of 
communication for our friends on the other side by adding good 
vibration and positivity to the circle.

I have been told by my guides that this is our ultimate goal to spread 
the word and educate as many new researchers as possible.

keep doing what you are doing and our friends will hold your hand 
through the journey.

Bruce</pre>
