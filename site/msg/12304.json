I have DC7 full and am able\nto record(log) as long as I want :)\nOne thing I noticed like you I can stop and then add/subtract filters\nand restart the log. The final file saved will have all with no\ninterruptions. The lag seems no problem and the real time filters do\nhelp for me to understand. I also tune up prior with audacity looking\nfor a nice waveform, not to big and not to small. I have many times\nhad stuff I could not understand because the volume was to loud and\nthe waveform was distorted. Oh well just some obs.

I had some success using DC6 Live Forensics and real-time\nmonitoring with \n&gt; headphones, using no background at all, as well as using radio\nsweep.  But as you \n&gt; mentioned, the filters that worked well one session often did not\nwork the next.  Go \n&gt; figure! ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; The demo of version 6 Forensics was cool because it worked for only\n1 minute at a time \n&gt; but never expired.  The demo of version 7 Forensics is a full\nworking version, without time \n&gt; restrictions, but after 30 days, it no longer works.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I used the setup a little differently in that I didn&#39;t use DC to\nrecord my sessions.  I used a \n&gt; second computer and a splitter line for the sound so when the 1\nminute time limit hit, I \n&gt; didn&#39;t have to stop the session, just rehit the play button so there\nwas only a second or so \n&gt; gap between each minute.  As I recall my setup looked like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; External mic to PC sound in\n&gt; Split line from PC sound out going to A) Mac laptop sound in & B) my\nheadphones\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking back through my notes, I had some pretty good results with\nthe following \n&gt; settings:\n&gt; \n&gt; Continuous Noise First\n&gt; * Attack 10\n&gt; * Release 364\n&gt; * Attenuation 31\n&gt; * CNF Forensic\n&gt; * FTF 2048\n&gt; * Overlap 50%\n&gt; \n&gt; Brick Wall Second\n&gt; * Frequency 3\n&gt; * Upper Frequency 8291\n&gt; * Length 948\n&gt; \n&gt; I just tried a variety of settings willy-nilly and happened to have\nsuccess with this one \n&gt; among a couple others.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jimskinnard&quot; &lt;joliet@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyone using dc6/dc7(Diamond Cut DC7) software. I have been\n&gt; &gt; experimenting with different filters to listen and record radio\n&gt; &gt; sweep(RS hack 20-125).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I wonder if anyone has found good filters and mods to the filters for\n&gt; &gt; using it real time filtering. The other day I threw together some of\n&gt; &gt; there pre-built filters and got a good session(easier to listen to).\n&gt; &gt; The next session those filters did not seem to work as well. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here is a quote from the site below(not the software distributor).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;DC6 is an audio editing program just like the ones we use for EVP\n&gt; &gt; (Audacity, Audition, GoldWave), except it has a neat feature called\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Live Multi-Filter.&quot; With this feature, audio coming into the computer\n&gt; &gt; can be filtered live and the result heard with a short delay of a\n&gt; &gt; second or so. A typical setup for EVP would be a microphone into the\n&gt; &gt; Microphone In jack of the computer with DC6 Live filtering what comes\n&gt; &gt; from the microphone and the output playing on the headphones connected\n&gt; &gt; to the computer&#39;s Headphone Out.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For those that have not heard of it, hear is a page explaining on how\n&gt; &gt; to use this piece of software.\n&gt; &gt; http://www.aaevp.com/techniques/techniques_evp11.htm\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Jim S.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
