<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This all seems simple to me. If you&#x27;re going to put up a recording for
others to listen to, others listen to it. They either hear it, they hear
something different, or they hear nothing. And they say so. That doesn&#x27;t
make less of what you hear. You hear what you hear. You&#x27;re free to assert
what you hear or change your mind and say it&#x27;s something else later on.

It seems to me that&#x27;s all we&#x27;re doing at this point. I&#x27;m not going to get
into a discussion of where the sounds came from or what they mean, I&#x27;d just
say yes I heard it or no I didn&#x27;t ot I heard something else.

Is that so difficult?

&gt; What you don&#x27;t seem to get is that there is more to the individual than the

&gt; Apparently reading what one wants to hear is also problem, and seems to ge
&gt; huge problme with he these skeptics. This one convinced I&#x27;m out to form a
&gt; group of groupies, and she ignores all else.
&gt;
&gt; Guess we are not allowed to question out loud, or throw thoughts and
&gt; theories out there for the consideration and comment of others. Sorry, not
&gt; being from &quot;here&quot; I didn&#x27;t learn all the social taboos of this primitive
&gt; culture. I tried goose stepping once, it made my ankles hurt.
&gt;
&gt; I took the skeptics off moderation in a mistaken effort to be fair, but all
&gt; this does is disrupt the conversation about what these voices are, and how
&gt; to hear it and interpret it better. This group is not about how to explain
&gt; all the inconvenient truths away.

This all seems simple o me. I you&#x27; e going o pu up a eco ding o o he s o lis en o, o he s lis en o i . They ei he hea i , hey hea some hing di e en , o hey hea no hing. And hey say so. Tha doesn&#x27; make less o wha you hea . You hea wha you hea . You&#x27; e ee o asse wha you hea o change you mind and say i &#x27;s some hing else la e on.

 
I seems o me ha &#x27;s all we&#x27; e doing a his poin . I&#x27;m no going o ge in o a discussion o whe e he sounds came om o wha hey mean, I&#x27;d jus say yes I hea d i o no I didn&#x27; o I hea d some hing else.
