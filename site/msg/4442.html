<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>OK - I just received my used 12-470 older version radio today and 
hacked it in about 10 minutes.  Works great, BUT I noticed on mine 
the length of the battery wires were not as generous as on Mike&#x27;s 
video or the 12-469 I hacked previously.  Thus, I had to sort of keep 
it almost together, peering deep inside with a magnifying glass to 
make sure I had the correct wire (7th from top - green for this one) 
and somehow snip it.  

I guess I am reporting this, because you really have to pay attention 
to the length of the battery box wires when you tear into these - 
they do vary, and are easy to accidentally detach off of the board.

&gt; So dummy here couldn&#x27;t even follow Mike&#x27;s great video instructions 
with the RS12-469.  After driving two hours to Merida, Mexico and 
then back and putting down 600 pesos (about $55 dollars) it took me 
ten minutes to do everything UFO Geek laid out in his video for 
hacking the radio shack box.  Cut the right pin labeled mute.  Closed 
the box nicely.  Nothing.  Reopened the box...looked around...two 
times more...still nothing.   Not even a light or hum.  
&gt;    
&gt;   Until I figure the radio thing out, I am in the mean time getting 
nowhere (it seems) with the EVP Maker on my computer to generate EVP 
noise and using my hand recorder etc.   Wish I could try the radio 
sistem...any real geeks who can give technical suggestions would be 
greatly appreciated.  Or maybe I should just throw away my 469 and 
start over.   Dont think RS will take it back.     geek-wanna-be, Ron
