<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>We hacked the 20-125 in about 10 minutes and it&#x27;s working great. The  
radio and an adaptor and some rechargeable batteries cost me $70.

&gt; Thanks for the help Juli. Now that you mention the 20-125, I remember
&gt; reading about Steve hacking it.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ve got the 12-469 &amp; 70 burned in my brain. Every time I&#x27;m near a
&gt; Radio Shack, I stop in to see if they have an older 470. I will
&gt; certainly try out the 20-125.
&gt;
&gt; I had actually been seriously thinking about getting a Mini Box, but
&gt; that&#x27;s a hefty price tag. Especially since I have no experience with
&gt; box research at this point.

&gt; &gt; Jeremy: IF you are unable to find an old 470 and you dont
&gt; care for the clicking on the 69, why don&#x27;t you try the 20-125? This
&gt; has the internal speaker and you can hack that as well. I believe
&gt; Steve has directions on his site, keyportparanormal.com.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Good luck!

&gt; &gt; I just read on the Paranormal Systems website that they
&gt; are developing
&gt; &gt; a new box called the MaxiBox. It has a lot of features I&#x27;ve heard
&gt; &gt; Bruce mention that would be beneficial to the boxes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hell, I&#x27;ve been trying my best to locate an older 12-470 to  
&gt; modify so
&gt; &gt; I could start doing the research. I know there is the 12-469, but
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve been hesitant because of all the talk about the annoying click.
