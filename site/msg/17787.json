With\n12 volts available I added one of my sweep boards, mounted beside the\nspeaker. I just wanted to to see if my sweep was somehow creating the noisy\naudio in my boxes.\n You don&#39;t have to sweep the entire band to get good results, just covering\na few stations is adequate to supply the raw audio. When Stein was\nexperimenting with this back in the 80s, he would just wobble the tuning\naround one point in the band--from what I understand, I&#39;ve never been able\nto e-mail him directly. Stein is a Danish researcher, and used the radio\nmethod first, and I think he&#39;s mentioned on the German VTF site.\n\n Frank-S\n\nI added a 12 ol egula o o he exis ing adio powe supply, i s a s ou wi h 15 ol s, and ha is egula ed down o 9 ol s o h adio.
