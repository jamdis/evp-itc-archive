&gt; Thanks Bruce.  
&gt; I did just notice that if you click on the link provided, it says 
the
&gt; file isn&#x27;t there.  I moved it to my folder titled Jeremy&#x27;s Files. 
&gt; Somehow I messed it up.  If someone could give me direction so I 
won&#x27;t
&gt; do this again, it would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

Jeremy,

When you intend to upload single files, go to the files section and 
open your folder, click on add file,click the browse button and 
locate the file on your computer click on the file you want and then 
click open, the file name will appear in the box left of the browse 
button. In the box below that type or copy and paste the description 
of the file you just loaded, below the description box there is a 
small check box, click it if you want the file to be announced to the 
group that it has been added, leave it blank if you do not want to 
announce it.

Sometimes the server will screw it up do to no fault of yours. So if 
you find the link is no good just do a quick post that the file is in 
your folder.

hope this helps
