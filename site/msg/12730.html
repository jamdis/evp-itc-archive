<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>And making a bomb from an atom was ludicrous.

The &quot;idiot&quot; with the degree is a physicist who has a wealth of work 
that has nothing to do with ITC or the paranormal. Statements like 
this appear to others as based on ignorance and reflects poorly only 
on the person who says it, indicating a lack of undersdtanding and 
tolerance for anything counter to their agenda.

If you make outstanding claims to the world, and can not back them up 
with data to demonstrate your claims, you will get scrutinized.

It will also feed your critics.

Lets add in common sense. IF you really are communicating with the 
dead, (and this would be huge) why isn&#x27;t on the front page of every 
news paper in the world?

Because it lacks what some of you don&#x27;t understand what I do. Build a 
case to confirm or debunk these claims.

I guess me question boils down to this; is this a group for objective 
discussion of ITC-EVP potential, or a fan club for Frank Sumption?

Dr. Rorke is a friend of mine. I haven&#x27;t attacked anyone in here 
because of their opinions, I have offered things I have learned over 
the years (since 1976). I am also one of those &quot;idiots&quot; with a 
degree, and it has made me quite a good living designing large scale 
audio systems and information distributions systems. There is no 
mystery in any of the electronic circuits used in ITC technology to 
me.

I don&#x27;t understand why if someone finds evidence that a duck is a 
duck, why people insist on calling it a bull. Research is about 
discovering the answer, even if it isn&#x27;t the answer you expect or are 
looking for. Granted, I totally understand if eople dissagree with 
someone&#x27;s findings, and to discredit it would require supporting 
data, not opinion. Too much of this field is filled with opinions 
instead of data.

I wish you all well and good luck with your experiments. I believed I 
have joined the wrong discussion group. To those who have e-mailed be 
I have enjoyed our conversations.

&gt; yes. i agree frank. I know that he is not coming from a totally
&gt; skeptical place with what he was saying, however, even if everything
&gt; could be totally repeatable in a lab, no evidence will ever be good
&gt; enough. Everyone called Marconi &quot;crazy&quot; when he was down in marconi
&gt; meadows, a part of city park in New Orleans, but radio was still 
born.
&gt; 
&gt; I say let them call us crazy and say what they want to. They will do
&gt; it anyways. We know the results that we are getting. If the world
&gt; doesn&#x27;t want to recognize it yet, its their problem. We will just be
&gt; laughing at them through one of your boxes that someone digs out of 
an
&gt; attic in 100 years from now...lol

&gt; &gt; &gt; Chris Moon and his use of Franks Box gets slammed
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Last night on Coast to Coast AM George Noory had Dr. Stephen 
Rorke
&gt; &gt; &gt; on-air. He discussed the field of instrumental 
transcommunication
&gt; &gt; &gt; (ITC), his study of the Spiricom case, Frank&#x27;s Box, and EVP 
&gt; &gt; capture.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It was during his discussion of Frank&#x27;s Box where he brought up 
&gt; &gt; the name
&gt; &gt; &gt; Chris Moon. He also brought up exactly what he thought of Chris 
&gt; &gt; Moon&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; use of the Franks Box he calls his telephone to the dead.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Better than writng about it, I&#x27;ve placed a link to the audio 
from 
&gt; &gt; last
&gt; &gt; &gt; night, at my post below.
