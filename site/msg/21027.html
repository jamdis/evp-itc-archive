<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The trouble is, everyone hears different, I only listen for obvious phrases and statements. I&#x27;m not gonna analyze anything, or spend excessive time on these files. I listen to the recordings a couple times, cuz I hear more the second time, but picking them apart usually &quot;creates&quot; more then is there. You could spend months on a file, slow it down, speed it up, reverse it... I was doing that yesterday with a EVPmaker session, could get entirely new comments by doubling the speed. Mostly, if they don&#x27;t speak it plain, I&#x27;m gonna ignore it. So don&#x27;t go wasting alot of time.

&gt;  Ok, I&#x27;m going to go through this one with a fine tooth comb, Frank, I used up the whole eng. alpha bet, plus the whole aramaic alphabet on separating the entire file in Wav format.  There might be something important in here, so I&#x27;m a gonna look, both backward and forward.  Maybe, i&#x27;ll learn something in the process. give me a couple of days on this one. Tks. sf

&gt; They say &quot;Transmit data&quot; at not quite 7 seconds, followed by &quot;from keyboard&quot;. I left the file long incase someone could hear something else in it.
