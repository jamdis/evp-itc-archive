<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Whose Ron!? Since this is response to my post I guess I will respond. I didn&#x27;t do any &quot;looking for&quot; or &quot;trying to contact&quot; David C. I never cared for the guy in life or death. No interest! Sorry to sound callous but...well...whatever!

Regards,

Frank R.

&gt; Ron, I already sent through the article which said, his  hands &quot;were tied 
&gt; behind his back&quot; everyone was too busy looking at the blood he  had been 
&gt; hanging a long time, all the blood was in his legs, and his upper torso  was 
&gt; white, is what one article said, some camera guy was there on the seen his  
&gt; name was Russell, and he claimed to have seen this type of thing before, I  
&gt; thought Steve or someone would put 2 and 2 together.  Guess not, I guess no  
&gt; one bothered to read what I sent out there. sf

&gt; His hands weren&#x27;t tied. All the articles I have seen only state his  neck 
&gt; was tied to his genitals. All I can say is good luck to him  now!

&gt; Why was he found with his hands tied behind his back, and the  noose around 
&gt; his neck and private parts, how was that an  accident?

&gt; It wasn&#x27;t suicide, it was  accidental:
&gt;  
&gt; Carradine Death Was  Accidental
&gt; 
&gt; IMDb, June 4,  2009
&gt; 
&gt; David Carradine died during a sex game that went  wrong, according to 
&gt; sources in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was found  dead on Thursday.
&gt; 
&gt; Carradine&#x27;s body was discovered in a hotel  suite and local reports 
&gt; suggested he committed suicide. 
&gt; 
&gt; He  was discovered by a maid, naked and hanged, but the suggestions his  
&gt; death had a sexual twist were strongly disputed by the star&#x27;s close  friend, 
&gt; attorney Vicki Roberts, and his manager Chuck Binder, who  insisted he died 
&gt; of natural causes. 
&gt; 
&gt; But a statement from  Carradine&#x27;s representative now indicates the actor 
&gt; died during a sex  act.
&gt; 
&gt; The spokesperson tells TMZ.com, &quot;We can confirm 100  percent that he never 
&gt; would have committed suicide. It was an  accidental death. Everybody is in 
&gt; shock.&quot; 
&gt; 
&gt; Rumours Carradine  died attempting auto-erotic asphyxiation- -where victims 
&gt; achieve  heightened sexual pleasure by restricting their air supply are  
&gt; backed up by a quote a Bangkok police officer gave to British  newspaper The 
&gt; Sun. 
&gt; 
&gt; The cop tells reporters, &quot;A rope was  attached to his neck and also to his 
&gt; penis&quot;. 
&gt; 
&gt; Rocker Michael  Hutchence was rumoured to have died attempting the same sex 
&gt; act in a  Sydney, Australia, hotel room back in 1997--although his death 
&gt; was  officially declared a suicide.
&gt; 
&gt; Carradine was in Thailand to  shoot the movie &quot;Stretch.&quot; He was 72.

&gt; The spirit world to talk with David Carradine,  to see  what happened, if 
&gt; someone may have killed him, it&#x27;s hard to  believe that he would take his own 
&gt; life, I feel like it was foul  play. sf
