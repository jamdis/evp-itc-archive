It took me maybe 5 minutes or less.  It has AM/FM and \nShortwave.  It also has a built in speaker and it was $39, so anyone \nthat is having trouble finding the old style 12-469 and 12-470 here is \nanother model that is readily accessible.  E-mail me privately for \ndetails, i have to run at the moment and can&#39;t get into the hack.  But \ni will post the specifics when i get home.  I&#39;m actually proud of \nmyself for figuring it out and not breaking it in the process.\n\n-Steve H."}
