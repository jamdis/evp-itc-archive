&gt;
&gt; It is simply an incident that I feel researchers should be aware of
&gt; as a possibility. Given in my opinion the boxes do open a portal due
&gt; to the connection necessary for real time two way communication, and
&gt; the wide spread belief that entities can and do manipulate physical
&gt; objects when in the presence of them.
&gt;
&gt; I have just been made aware of a situation that has happened to a
&gt; fairly new researcher whom I believe to be honest and forthcoming.
&gt;
&gt; the incident involved the aftermath of a regular RS box session. The
&gt; researcher had finished his session with the practice of asking that
&gt; any entities that may have traveled through the box, return and asked
&gt; for conformation, then proceeded to end the session and turn the box
&gt; off. he was assured that he turned the box off by going back to the
&gt; recording after the incident and validating verbally that he did in
&gt; fact turn off the box.
&gt;
&gt; He left the room for a few moments , when he returned he allegedly
&gt; witnessed a white cloud move across the room and noticed that his RS
&gt; box was turned on and running.
&gt;
&gt; This is actually the first instance I have encountered where the
&gt; possibility of an entity that may have
&gt;
&gt; purposely stayed behind to turn the box back on and let other
&gt; entities through. matter of fact
&gt;
&gt; that concept has not occurred to me before. but now sounds very
&gt; possible.
&gt;
&gt; This may even happen at times we are never aware of and they actually
&gt; turn the box on and when
&gt; whatever comes through is through they turn it off again and we are
&gt; none the wiser.
&gt;
&gt; I will definitely address this in my sessions, what I suggest is
&gt; until we come to a mutual agreement among researchers
&gt; on this occurrence, I think it best that when we end a session we
&gt; remove at least one battery from the box to prevent it being turned
&gt; back on.
