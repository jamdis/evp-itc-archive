noo I sorta think they are very much aware of the time....in the beginning =
of my box sessions I would be so excited I would sometimes be up late in th=
e night doing sessions..".I was asked at some point do you sleep" also they=
 would say we need to sleep etc...I have this on recording somewhere on a C=
D. I wouldn't say they said anything without me having prove...but then aga=
in I record everything lol..you never know :)

So which one is the RIGH=

=C2=A0
Well, I think they all are.

For many years I followed the wo=

(His "official" position is that he simply didn'=

All I kn=

Frank,

Remember last year when we both got the A=

I'm pretty sure that they can't tell the future, so when they =
