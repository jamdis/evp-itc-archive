Using the shuffle\nalso down on power consumption for me as well.  Basically using \nevpmaker to chop up a supplied voice file, I did a straight loop back\nin to the computer to record it (i.e. not through the speakers, so\nthere&#39;s no contamination of the sound file with outside noise or\nunwanted evp).  After creating an hour long file recording, I loaded\nthis on the shuffle, then amplify it through the box.  As a\nresearcher, my concern in the past had been regarding some complaints\npeople had - that because you&#39;re pulling in radio signals you have no\nability to provide a control subject.  I.e. no way to tell what was on\na station at a certain time that you could be tuning in on, so you can\ndiscount it from the proposed evp reception.  I&#39;m trying to solve that\nby providing a known sound file that can be compared and contrasted\nagainst.\n\nMy question to people, is what design are people using for the chamber\nof the box itself?  I.e. what baffling construction, etc.  Have you\nfound a specific design and/or specific materials to be more effective\nthan others?\n\n\nMarty\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday\n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hey Deb,\n&gt;  \n&gt; What I think you should be experimenting with a radio shack hack.\n&gt; you can pick up a 12-469 at radio shack for 24.99 and you will be able\n&gt; to start doing box research as opposed to traditional evp . \n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday"}
