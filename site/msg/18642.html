<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ok, we&#x27;re new here hello!

We just had a couple questions. HOW do you tell if you&#x27;re being ripped off if you are searching online to buy a box?  If you can point us in the right direction of where to purchase a &quot;frank&#x27;s box&quot; would be deeply appreciated.
We saw that you can try and make your own but with my husband&#x27;s work schedule and mine with 4 kids, sports etc.. the only time we get to work with EVP&#x27;s and such is when we schedule an investigation and secure a babysitter! LOL Not to mention my husband isn&#x27;t that technologically inclined. That is my job... and I would be afraid that I&#x27;d have done something incorrectly and what we were experiencing really wasn&#x27;t &quot;true&quot;.
Sorry to sound like such a newbie I&#x27;m sure!

Thank you! Teddy</pre>
