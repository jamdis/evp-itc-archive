Once upon a time I used to know how to \nread circuit schematics being a ham radio operator, but that was a very \nlong time ago. I would certainly like to refresh my knowledge and \nattempt completion of my own projects based on some of the schematics \nhere. Modifying existing devices comes easy for me, but starting from \nscratch leaves me scratching my head...\n\nthanks in advance\nAndy"}
