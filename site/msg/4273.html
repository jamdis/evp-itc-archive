<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks, Mike.  

I am still working on different set-ups in a sound chamber.  I 
realize the chamber is not necessary, but I think with the 12-469, it 
helps to run it into a box to mix it, which helps remove the &quot;click&quot; 
noise received while it sweeps the AM band.  Also, I want to try 
bouncing down an echo chamber, so it slows the sound down a bit to 
possibly make it easier to hear. Still experimenting here.

&gt; Hi LC,
&gt; 
&gt; The mic is a &quot;ListenUp&quot; brand.  I got it at Radio Shack.  They had 
&gt; their own brand there too, but theirs was about $12 more.  I think 
&gt; they just started carrying the &quot;ListenUp&quot; brand.  I like the blue 
&gt; light effect too...
&gt; The earbuds came with the mic, but they are not amplifeid, just the 
&gt; mic is.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Mike, one more question for you:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What&#x27;s the brand of amplified mic you are using and does Radio 
&gt; SHack 
&gt; &gt; have it, too?  It seems to be a bit better than the amplified 
lapel 
&gt; &gt; mic I am using inside my echo chamber.  I am experimenting with 
two 
&gt; &gt; mics, as when I added the splitter I couldn&#x27;t get any audio out 
of 
&gt; it 
&gt; &gt; like you do.  It must either be the mic you are using is better, 
or 
&gt; &gt; the headphones/earbuds you use are amplified (??).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; LC

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have produced another video, this one of my completed 
portable 
&gt; &gt; Ghost 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Box System (Mike&#x27;s Box 12.470)
&gt; &gt; &gt; This video, in three parts on YouTube walks you through how the 
&gt; &gt; chamber 
&gt; &gt; &gt; system works, while describing the components and going through 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; description of how to control the devices with the chamber 
closed.
