&gt; Amen to that Ann. I&#x27;ve met more angels than devils for sure. lol!  
&gt; I&#x27;m not convinced that having had an NDE was what caused Erland&#x27;s,  
&gt; my, and others sensitivity, but maybe. Some are just more sensitive  
&gt; than others.  What was really interesting was that I was told that  
&gt; I&#x27;m &quot;very protected&quot; and that&#x27;s what stopped the events - which I  
&gt; can&#x27;t say were all that negative, just unexpected and very super  
&gt; natural. Having a voice come through the air vents of you vehicle,  
&gt; lights flashing, papers flying, and even having your mail man  
&gt; report &quot;something&quot; said hello to him on our porch when we weren&#x27;t  
&gt; home, was very unnerving, but I can&#x27;t say it was all bad. Just  
&gt; incredibly weird.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; One funny thing to note about my experience... I got annoyed -  
&gt; REALLY annoyed at their behavior and refused to speak to them. I  
&gt; was doing laundry when the light above me began buzzing/flashing  
&gt; and suddenly a voice came through and apologized for the trouble.
&gt;
&gt; I think of these things now and hardly believe them myself. They  
&gt; just seem a bit too &quot;Hollywood&quot; for my taste. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t  
&gt; experience them alone and people that know me still talk about  
&gt; things that happened today. It made very clear to me that this  
&gt; world we experience in a body, isn&#x27;t real. We&#x27;re pretty limited in  
&gt; what our mortal senses can perceive. Outside of this fleshy avatar  
&gt; is so much more!

&gt;&gt; I would reason that since the majority of people experience such  
&gt;&gt; positive outcomes from an NDE--it is in the whole a positive  
&gt;&gt; experience for almost every person who has one--it would not  
&gt;&gt; provide the necessary negative energy for purportedly negative  
&gt;&gt; entities to feed off. In fact, the majority of NDEers are  
&gt;&gt; transformed in a very positive way indeed. Rarified, even. Seems  
&gt;&gt; like an odd food choice for the Fishes.
