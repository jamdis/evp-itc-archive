<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I get that too, sometimes i turn it on and they are in mid 
conversation.  Than a couple minutes later they say &quot;Steve&#x27;s here&quot; or 
something like that.  I wonder if they have an &quot;On AiR&quot; light that 
comes on when we turn the box on.  Almost like a radio station on 
their side, saying &quot;Well, we have a caller on the line----It&#x27;s Steve 
from Keyport and he wants to ask some stupid questions&quot;.  Silly 
scenario, but that&#x27;s how it seems.  To answer your question, i had 
asked if they had any messages for me before that answer came out.  
But there was too much time that lapsed between it, so i wasn&#x27;t sure 
if i could use that as an answer to my question.

&gt; Hi Steve.  Was this response in relation to something you&#x27;d said?  
I absolutely can hear it as 
&gt; you are, but I hear it equally well as, &quot;Howard said.&quot;  I notice 
this a lot in my own 
&gt; recordings, being able to hear a couple very similar sounding 
phrases in the same 
&gt; example.  
&gt; 
&gt; In regard your post about them maybe being earthbound ... I don&#x27;t 
know how we could 
&gt; determine that based only on what is said.  I suppose you could do 
a followup session to 
&gt; ask who it is, where they are, and if he was talking to you.  I 
know sometimes in my 
&gt; sessions, I&#x27;m essentially &#x27;eavesdropping&#x27; on an other side 
conversation, and what is being 
&gt; said doesn&#x27;t really apply to me.  Sort of like picking up on a 
party phone line.
