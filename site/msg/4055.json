Someone told me that they use a glass on it&#39;s side and put a mic inside for a sea shell effect while recording EVP&#39;s and that helps to capture more of them (I guess like an echo chamber effect)!!!    =Judy=           --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Interesting, but there&#39;s a few misconceptions about my work. I used \n&gt; quartz crytals, not as part of any circuits or for frequency, some of \n&gt; the &quot;contacts&quot; request the crystals, so I place them on, or in sound \n&gt; chamber, it seems to help with some entities, as do magents used in \n&gt; the same way. There&#39;s no way to conect them to the circuit.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I used radio modules from car stereos because they were already \n&gt; designed to be volatage tuned, so I could use the random voltage \n&gt; generator to tune these moudules randomly. Following EVPmaker as an \n&gt; example, I had thought the tuning had to be random, as I thought \n&gt; there was somekind of quantum resonance going on to get the voices. \n&gt; That assumption has proved to be false, a linear scan is far superior \n&gt; to random scan. I don&#39;t care what the &quot;primary tester&quot; claims, he \n&gt; doesn&#39;t make the things. I still don&#39;t know how the voices are made. \n&gt; \n&gt;  We&#39;ve also found anyone can do the same thing as a box by manually \n&gt; tuning a radio across it&#39;s band slowly by hand while recording. It&#39;s \n&gt; easier to have the precess automated, but the manual method is good \n&gt; for quickie messages and guidence when needed. You wouldn&#39;t want to \n&gt; get hooked on doing sessions to ask about every little thing in your \n&gt; life though. \n&gt; \n&gt;  Personally, I don&#39;t have all these higher ideals, asperations, or \n&gt; goals as some seem to claim in the paranormal field. I don&#39;t insist \n&gt; only the higher beings coming through with only the blessing of some \n&gt; deity--I don&#39;t care what talks. I get some cussing and name calling --\n&gt; sometimes, but big deal! It does in fact show it&#39;s not broadcast \n&gt; fragments. As for portals some claim opened--I don&#39;t even know what \n&gt; they are talking about, I have never experienced a portal--or \n&gt; anything that might be considered evil--except perhaps some of the \n&gt; living. I can&#39;t imagine box use being anymore dangerous than watching \n&gt; to much TV, and taking every show as gospel truth. Wonder how many \n&gt; live their lives by what&#39;s on Friends, or Saturday Night Live!? 90% \n&gt; or more of what I get is just my familar guys, my unseen friends, \n&gt; talking, mostly very non-profound comments. I get some relatives, my \n&gt; son, and dad, maybe an uncle from time to time, I don&#39;t take it like \n&gt; it&#39;s all profound and mystical, it&#39;s just communcations--ya don&#39;t \n&gt; have to worship it, and you don&#39;t need some guru to interpret it! I \n&gt; don&#39;t know how many can hear this stuff rihgt away, it might take \n&gt; practice, since the voices are composites of various voices and music \n&gt; bits mixed with radio noise. \n&gt;  The function of the box is to provide the &quot;raw&quot; audio which &quot;they&quot; \n&gt; use to form a voice. It is not the only way, there are many method \n&gt; that work as well, and at times better. \n&gt; \n&gt;  As far as antenna, I just use a piece of wire and an Rf amplifier, I \n&gt; don&#39;t care about resonating for each frquency, that would be very \n&gt; cumbersome, and useless. Imagine a car with 10,000 antennas sticking \n&gt; out it! Even on ham radio I have one 100 foot long dipole I use on \n&gt; all hf bands, and talk all over the world on less than 5 watts. Of \n&gt; course I use an antenna tuner to resonate it for the band I&#39;m on. I \n&gt; also haven&#39;t been on the air since starting EVP, it eats all my time!\n&gt; \n&gt;  It&#39;s only the audio that I consider important, radio is a convenient \n&gt; source of a mix of speech, music and noise that can be chopped up \n&gt; easily by tuning. There is a program that does this on the computer, \n&gt; called EVPmaker, and my boxes were an analog version of EVPmaker. I \n&gt; am still curious why some spirits seems unable to use the computer \n&gt; method, which lead to my boxes by asking waht else could I use?\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-s\n&gt;"}
