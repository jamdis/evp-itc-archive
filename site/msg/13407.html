I find most paranormal shows have become BS and I don't watch any. Its all =
the same "dog and pony" act. Since "Ghost Hunters" has become a hit "everyo=
ne" wants their own tv show or radio show. Its all "look at me".

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Door To The Dead



  I have to admit that I thought I h=
ad seen the worst 'paranormal' show on television already. I was wrong. Doo=
r to the Dead has exceeded my worst expectations.

  Generally, I respect J=
ohn Oliver's work as a medium. While I have no personal experience with him=
, in the past he has looked and acted more genuine than not, the rolling of=
 the eyes put aside for the moment.

  I do take exception to the character=
ization of the talking box as an Edison device. I have documented the histo=
ry of Edison, ITC and EVP  elsewhere. This is however the smallest concern =
I have with this show.

  Prior to wathcing I had just had a conversation w=
ith a respected colleague on the West coast regarding interesting phenomena=
 he and others are constantly observing in sites with phenomena similar to =
that on Door to the Dead. None of those measurements were made by this team=
. The use of thermal in this situation is not indicated as well.

  The rea=
l concern is that no attempt was made to help this family in a broader cont=
ext. The skeptic did and said nothing skeptical as far as I could tell. Key=
 questions were not asked (at least on-camera) that would reveal the psycho=
-dynamics of this family. We know fairly well at this time that PK phenomen=
a is often centered on a focal person who can exhibit specific characterist=
ics. That the team seems unaware of this is quite disturbing to a person li=
ke myself.

  A real research opportunity was lost in this case, as was an =
opportunity to educate the public on the right way to approach such situati=
ons. Continually sending the messages that phenomena is based on 'demons' a=
nd 'spirits' exclusively does nothing to further the position of serious in=
vestigators, which is perhaps most troubling of all.
