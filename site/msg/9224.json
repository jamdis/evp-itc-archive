I have been studying about ITC\nresearch and EVP&#39;s for some time. I started doing EVP&#39;s with my Sony\ntape recorder about three weeks ago. So far, I have gotten many Class\nA EVP&#39;s.\n\nOn Sunday, I did my recording from my bedroom. I am disabled and was\nin quite a bit of pain that evening. I just listened to the tape a few\nminutes ago and was astounded. I can hear a good friend of mine, Jean,\nthat passed in 1991, calling my name as clear as a bell. Then someone\nelse, whispers my name loudly into the tape recorder. After that you\ncan hear a young girl giggle. I think it was her that whispered into\nthe tape recorder. \n\nI had tears of joy realizing that my good friend is trying to contact me. \n\nHas anyone else had Spirits laugh or giggle on an EVP. That part kind\nof made me nervous.\n\nThanks everyone,\n\nJeremy\nNew York, New York"}
