<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have one somewhat similar to it. I was going to remark that the cat
whisker assembly seems to be missing.

Those things were designed to be used with a set of high-impedance
headphones.

&gt; Its a crystal radio receiver. Probably made in the early 20&#x27;s judging by
&gt; the condition and parts used. The front controls are tuning and headphone
&gt; volume.
&gt; A crystal detector is meant to plug into that socket, and the set wont work
&gt; without it. A (modern) germanium diode could be used instead and soldered
&gt; across the socket terminals.
&gt; The wire on the coil looks like its loosing its insulation so the coil is
&gt; probably faulty and would have to be re-wound.

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ll be the first to admit I&#x27;m no expert when it comes to ITC. The
&gt; majority of
&gt; &gt; my experience comes from working with Chris (Moon) and his box for the
&gt; past 3
&gt; &gt; years. The results still never cease to amaze me!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyhow, I came across this device at an estate auction. It appears to be
&gt; an
&gt; &gt; antique communication device of some sort. The only verifiable
&gt; information I
&gt; &gt; have is that is was probably built around 1910-1912, which is before
&gt; radio was
&gt; &gt; publicly available.
&gt; &gt; (I obtained this date from researching the packaging cylinder used to
&gt; build the
&gt; &gt; device.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any thoughts on what it might be? I did show this device
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; Chris a while back and he agreed that it probably was a communication
&gt; device. He
&gt; &gt; also suggested I show it to Frank... = )
&gt; &gt; According to Chris&#x27;s box, &quot;this IS a communication device of historical
&gt; value.&quot;
&gt; &gt; It also mentioned the device was &quot;meant specifically for me to have, but
&gt; no
&gt; &gt; longer worked.&quot; There was more, but I&#x27;m trying to remain unbiased and
&gt; only
&gt; &gt; use tangible evidence. However, I have little to go on.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If anyone has any clues or can lead me in a research direction I would
&gt; &gt; appreciate it! Thanks!
