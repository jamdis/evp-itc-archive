It \nwould be far easier to simply put something like, &quot;Make this ghost \nbox yourself for $25. at UFOGeek.com&quot; on a sign pictured beside the \nradio.\n\nIf you get &#39;em to UFOGeek.com, they can figure it out from there.  \nUnfortunately, many of the people buying those radios are probably \nthinking it to be difficult to do the alteration.\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am open to any ideas.

For a $1 listing fee, and no hassles of buying \n&gt; product in advance then \n&gt; &gt; having to ship, that would be totally worth it.  Unlimited \n&gt; downloads (for how long can you \n&gt; &gt; list - 9 days?) would reach a heck of a lot more people than \n&gt; selling units at cost.  :-)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Margaret\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; opps I mean:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Can someone send me the written instructions on how to hack the \n&gt; 12-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 469!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@...m, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I checked to see what it would cost to sell one of ebay.
