<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My take on it is that the spirits or whatever they are are capable of using
whatever methods are placed in front of them. DVR&#x27;s get EVP. I&#x27;ve gotten EVP
on the sound tracks of a video recorder. The radio and ITC seems to generate
a different class of communication. EVP-Maker is another one.

Probably the method of actually producing the sound waves is different for
each device.

&gt;  Raymond Bayless was getting recorded spirit voices back in the 1950&#x27;s.
&gt;
&gt; While his best known work was with von Salazy on audio tape, Bayless
&gt;
&gt; also received voices using an early grammophone-style recording device.
&gt;
&gt; In other words, he was using strictly a mechanical recorder. This would
&gt;
&gt; suggest that the voices may not require electronics at all. And that would
&gt;
&gt; imply that radio signals may have nothing to do with the voice reception.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Consider too that EVPMAKER sessions seem to work well for some people.
&gt;
&gt; Except for the mechnical recordings, which are few in number, all the
&gt;
&gt; current techniques have electronics in common. So it would make sense
&gt;
&gt; that electronics might be important to the process. However, when
&gt;
&gt; you factor in the mechanical recordings made using devices prior to
&gt;
&gt; modern electronics, it seems more sensible to look for a common
&gt;
&gt; explanation which involves environmental manipulation. The most reasonable
&gt;
&gt; thing we know of that meets this criterion is mind-matter interaction,
&gt;
&gt; or psychokinesis (PK).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The only remaining question then, aside from the actual source of the
&gt;
&gt; information which cannot be objectively ascertained as of yet, is whether
&gt;
&gt; a single or multiple mechanisms are indeed at work. Even though radio waves
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; are not required to produce the phenomena, if multiple mechanisms are at
&gt; work,
&gt;
&gt; it may be that radio waves are one of many ways the phenomena is produced.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Bottom line, with so many options much more information is needed to form
&gt; any
&gt;
&gt; reasonable hypothesis.
