Well, th=

cause 
of this it's going to be tough, if I gave everyone's  opinion out of=
 the 4

His. sf

I think it does matter t=
hough.  

One of the things we're trying to do is set  up an objective fram=
ework for 
experimenting with  some of these aspects.  I think we have all =
 experienced 
the difficulty in hearing what is on  some of these recording=
s: sometimes 
we're not sure  at first what it says. Sometimes we ask other=
s for  their 
input.  Sometimes we only hear it once  someone else tells us=
 it first.  
Sometimes we  hear it wrong.  Sometimes we hear it right. And =
 so on.

It would be useful to know, as an  individual, how good we are at =
hearing 
it right, so  we have some idea how trustworthy our skill, or  met=
hods, or 
technology, is.  If we can measure  that, or even get a feel for =
it, we can 
look for  ways to improve it.  If we can't measure it,  then we=
 could be 
stuck.  

So, by  restricting the answers only to the timeframe =
of the  experiment, 
we can help filter out some of the  problems of subjec=
tivity: for example, 
one theory is  that people can hear what they want to=
 hear, or can  these 
sounds in a certain way, once you already know  the a=
nswer.  Or, given 2 ways to 
hear a sound,  being influenced, even subconsc=
iously, to hear it  one way 
over the other.  We want to rule that  out.

T=
his is one reason we can only count on  answers given during the 
timeframe=
.  That is  when the answer is most objective.  Once the  object has been 
=
announced, we move into a   period where we can't discount possible influen=
ce  
from already knowing the answer.

But, I am  confident that if a perso=
n's method or technology  really can 
reveal the correct answer outside the=
  timeframe, then doing it within the 
timeframe should  be just as easy, a=
nd would then be a valid objective  result 
for all to see.

Thanks again for=
 everyone who  participated! I admire your courage and  
motivation to try =
different methods, see what  works, and try to improve 
everyone's  underst=
anding of EVP-ITC.

If you recall,  on 7/10/2010 I placed an object on top =
of my  computer 
monitor, right in front of me, and left  it there until to=
day, 7/14/2010, noon 
Denver  time. The experiment was for participants to =
 determine what it was. 
Vague or partial answers  wouldn't be counted (for=
 example, just colors,  
shapes, sizes, what it's made of, etc): we're  loo=
king for what it is. 
Participants could use  their ghost boxes, EVP record=
ers, or I suppose  any other 
means they chose.

In order to  keep me hones=
t, I took a picture of the object  at the start 
of the experiment and load=
ed it to  the Files section (RJ folder) of this 
group. If  you can follow =
the link, it is here:

_http://tech.  groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/file=
s/  RJ/RJ.20100710. 
1.zip_ (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/fil=
es/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip) 

The idea was  that you could download the file a=
t the  beginning of the 
test, and 'keep it safe' on  your computer. Then a=
t the end of the test, I  
would release the password so you could reveal  =
the contents of the file. That 
way, you were in  control of the original i=
mage during the entire  test, not 
me. 

The password for that file  is: 12=
3BlastOff
Instructions, if you need  them, are also in that RJ folder.

And=
 if  you did not care to download the zip file before  the test, I will 
po=
st the final image there  too.

So to the results:

Number of  participants=
: 5
Total tries: 8
Ambiguous  answers: 0
Correct answers: 0

Object:  A rad=
io
Uzipped picture:
_http://tech.  groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ =
 RJ/RJ.20100710. 
1.JPG_ (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/=
RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG) 

So what do the  results mean? All that we can reall=
y agree on  from this 
experiment is that no participant,  with whatever th=
eories or methods or 
technology  they used, was able to correctly determin=
e the  object. We can't say 
those theories or methods  or technologies nev=
er work. Just as we can't say  
they do. Just that, for whatever reason, th=
ey  did not work this time. 
Readers can take the  results, use them to imp=
rove or change their  methods, or 
keep doing what they're  doing.

If anyo=
ne has any observations,  comments, or ideas for improvement, let me 
know.=
  I hope to get a new experiment up and running  soon. Since there 
wasn't =
much participation  Mon-Wed, I think the next experiment will be  
arranged=
 to mostly span the  weekends.

Again, thanks to everyone who  participated=
 in this first  experiment.

             some of these aspects.  I think we have all

                   some of these recordings: sometimes we're not sure 
    =
                        at first what it says. Sometimes we ask others for =

                            their input.  Sometimes we only hear it o=
nce 
                            someone else tells us it first.  Some=
times we 
                            hear it wrong.  Sometimes we hea=
r it right. And 
                            so on.<BR><BR>It would be usef=
ul to know, as an 
                            individual, how good we are =
at hearing it right, so 
                            we have some idea how =
trustworthy our skill, or 
                            methods, or technolo=
gy, is.  If we can measure

get a feel for it, we can look for 
                            ways to imp=
rove it.  If we can't measure it, 
                            then we=
 could be stuck.  <BR><BR>So, by

ing the answers only to the timeframe of the

xperiment, we can help filter out some of the 
                            =
problems of subjectivity: for example, one theory is

       that people can hear what they want to hear, or can

             these sounds in a certain way, once you already know 
        =
                    the answer.  Or, given 2 ways to hear a sound,

                          being influenced, even subconsciously, to hear it=
 
                            one way over the other.  We want to rule=
 that 
                            out.<BR><BR>This is one reason we can on=
ly count on 
                            answers given during the timeframe=
.  That is 
                            when the answer is most object=

 we move into a  
                            period where we can't di=

eveal the correct answer outside the
