You have to tell how much and were to get one. I need a new DVR for my nigh=
t vision cameras. I need to be able to hook an external mic to it as well, =
as the cameras do not have audio capability. I was going to buy the Radio S=
hack one as someone suggested to me. Which would be fine, but I would reall=
y like to have USB connection.

Does it have an internal harddrive?

  I bought a Radio Shack digital recore=
d years, and never liked it much. I picked up an Olympus WS-21S this aftern=
oon on a whim. I made a line to mic adapter, and did a couple box recording=
s. I don't know, might be better than tape. I has the advantage of of built=
 in USB connector, and it records in WMA format. 

   I tried a short recor=
ding last night using the tones in 51, I don't think they help.
