Not as good as the QR&#39;s but it does get evps.\n&gt; A guideline I can suggest is to look for older recorders that dont have USB (earphone jack only, like the QR&#39;s). The older recorders are more likely to have codecs that are less efficient at conversion, subsequently generate artifacts, and therefore more likely to be better at evp.\n&gt; Good luck Urs.\n&gt; JEFF\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; well Im going to have get something else those are really up there in price...any other suggestions?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Mon, 1/10/11, vortex6066 &lt;vortex6066@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: vortex6066 &lt;vortex6066@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Another Recorder---Panasonic RR-QR200\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Monday, January 10, 2011, 1:04 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Â  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The QR100 and 200 were the only ones that had a codec similar to the earlier DR60. I wouldnt bother therefore with any later Panasonics than the QR200. If you can get a 100, its almost identical, except it has less memory (recording time).\n&gt; &gt; JEFF\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the line of Panasonic RR does any one know which others are good besides the qr200 my recorder died on me shopping for a new one i had aÃ‚Â Ã‚Â olympics\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Sat, 1/8/11, Snowfire Lioness &lt;SnowfireL@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Snowfire Lioness &lt;SnowfireL@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Another Recorder---Panasonic RR-QR200\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, rtsc@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Saturday, January 8, 2011, 12:33 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ã‚Â  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; These old ears are hearing a whisper voice, not sure if it&#39;s man or lady, saying &quot;Steve, help me&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: urkel23@\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: rtsc@yahoogroups.com; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Fri, Jan 7, 2011 6:59 pm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Another Recorder---Panasonic RR-QR200 [1 Attachment]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ã‚Â  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Attachment(s) from urkel23@ included below] \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ã‚Â \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This seems to be the second most sought after recorder for evp&#39;s, so i found one on ebay.Ã‚Â  Much cheaper when the listing doesn&#39;t say EVP in the title.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ã‚Â \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Got this one for a song !Ã‚Â  I was just testing it out and i thought i heard something, let me know what you guys hear.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ã‚Â \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Steve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ã‚Â \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ã‚Â \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ã‚Â \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Steve Hultay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; www.keyportparanormal.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; www.stevehultay.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; www.rtscresearch.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
