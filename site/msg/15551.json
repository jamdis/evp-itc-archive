I have had two Frank&#39;s\n&gt; boxes #&#39;s 12 and 29. #12  was stolen from me by a low life that took\n&gt; advantage of my generosity.  That is another story.\n&gt; I still have Frank&#39;s box #29, the reason you  never hear files from me \nusing\n&gt; that box is because it literally  &quot;Sucks!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Most if not all Frank&#39;s boxes are inherently filled  with static white \nnoise\n&gt; and that combined with a metal echo box and  noise generator make it very\n&gt; difficult to hear anything let alone  communication which is difficult \nenough\n&gt; to hear from a quiet box like  the 125.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank&#39;s box has seen it&#39;s day and served it&#39;s  purpose in my opinion it is\n&gt; antiquated and is no where near the  quality of even a small cheap RS \n12-469\n&gt; as far as clarity of  communication.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank is actually using the guts from RS hacks  to build his boxes now so \nwhy\n&gt; have a &quot;FRANKENBOX&quot; that is essentially  an RS hack with noise added \ninstead\n&gt; of just buying an RS box and  getting better communication? \n&gt; \n&gt; Mind you this is only my  opinion but it is based on years of experience \nwith\n&gt; every box that is  or has been used. I currently have 14 different boxes \nnot\n&gt; to mention  EVP maker and I have done extensive sessions and research with\n&gt; each  and for my money you can give me a 20-125 every time, the Frank&#39;s \nbox\n&gt;  should be retired to the box museum where it belongs.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am  the only person in this research that will come out and speak the  \ntruth\n&gt; about the Frank&#39;s box, there are many people now that have them  and the \nonly\n&gt; person you will ever hear a file from is Steve Hultay and  sometimes Frank\n&gt; himself, and Frank&#39;s files are so rough you may hear 1  out of a hundred\n&gt; files the way he does due to the fact that he does  not even take the \ntime to\n&gt; do a proper session he just turns the box on  and records a couple of \nminute\n&gt; using his CELL PHONE !\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank has his place in RTSC history due to his ALLEGED invention off  the\n&gt; first ghost box and he deserves the respect for his  &quot;POSSIBLE&quot;\n&gt; accomplishment but to be revered as a god in the box field  NO not by me\n&gt; anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; I use the words &quot;ALLEGED&quot; and  &quot;POSSIBLE&quot; in terms of his being the first \nto\n&gt; create the ghost box due  to some recent information that has been \nbrought to\n&gt; my attention that  concerns an individual that created, built and used A\n&gt; Radio Sweeping  Ghost Box in 1969.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am gathering information and  documentation now and will hopefully be \nable\n&gt; to dispel the myth of  Frank sumption being the father of the ghost Box \nsoon.\n&gt; \n&gt; That  is to be continued!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; All is possible,  nothing is probable\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; \n&gt;  ------------  ----  ----\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n**************An Excellent Credit Score is 750.
