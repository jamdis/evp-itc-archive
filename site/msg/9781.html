I have had great success with my 12-469. Hope to have some of my 
session files up soon. I have to share my computer at home with my 
16 year old son so mom doesnt get much time on it. I dont think the 
spirits like the 12-280 or I have just not learned to hear them on 
the FM band it sweeps so fast on the 12-820. I wont give up on it 
though.

&gt;   Yes I did get the 12-820, and I didn&#x27;t get very good reception 
with it.  For some reason I can&#x27;t get myself away from the 12-469.  
I have been getting some tremendous results with it. 
&gt;   If you have a 12-469, just give it a try, you&#x27;ll get some 
results soon, or maybe you haven&#x27;t got your EVP real-time 
communication ears yet.  It took me awhile to get mine, and still I 
miss some things.

&gt; Did you get the RS 12-820 yet? Wondering if it is working good for 
you.
&gt; I havent got anyone to talk to me on it yet.
