    Yes, I agree with you on this. Espec=

    Yes - that is why you HAVE to remain unbiased, which is=
 difficult, but I can do it.

Especially in cases where PK may be in play (such as the Ouija example) a r=

 consider that the very notion that anyone is moving anything is problemati=

        I was taking advantage of the physical nat=

 one wishes to remove reliance on belief systems alone. This is what many i=

the most trivial experimental set up, which is unfortunate but true. This i=
s yet one more reason to exercise caution with solely anecdotal experimenta=

 pretty tricky, as I have said before, because it often is not simply factu=
al in nature. It tends to be more about emotions and feelings and that's wh=

        I wish yo=
