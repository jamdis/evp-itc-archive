<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

It seems to me that simply being on this list and taking these discoveries seriously, we already ARE thinking for ourselves.

Seriously, why would anyone use/waste time on this subject (and this list) if he or she wanted the safety of accepted, mainstream, dogmatic thinking?  (Rhetorical question.)

I understand that some people feel obliged to play &quot;Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; with new and extraordinary theories and R&amp;D, but it seems to me that the Devil has enough advocates, thank you.

Healthy skepticism is one thing.  All I&#x27;m seeing here is compelling evidence supporting EVP/ITC, followed by attempts to shout down the concepts.

It looks like you&#x27;re attacking the messenger. I don&#x27;t think this is the right forum for that... if any is. 

However, since I&#x27;m new to this Yahoo Group, maybe I misunderstood what this group is about.

Bemused,
Fiona
