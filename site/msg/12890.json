Give it a try and ask\nthe others listening to help her to understand.\n\nI think she would be offset if you return kindness.\n\nfloyd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;neli_nelis&quot; &lt;neli_nelis@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know what to do, is the second time that a spirit gets in my \n&gt; cell, just to insult me, then &quot;she&quot; gets away, then others come to \n&gt; bring wonderful messages, are some spirits envious of us ? I think its \n&gt; the same spirit that have insulted me, its a woman, don&#39;t know who she \n&gt; was or is, but she had handled to get in to insult me. Do I have to \n&gt; tell her to go away and leave me alone ? or do I have to insult her \n&gt; back ?\n&gt; \n&gt; any ideas ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Neli\n&gt;"}
