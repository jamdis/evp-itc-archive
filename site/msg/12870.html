While I&#x27;ve learned a lot from some others about tips for doing 
investigations, I don&#x27;t think there is a &quot;right way&quot; or &quot;wrong way&quot; you 
can&#x27;t find out for yourself as long as you keep basic safety and manners 
in mind - e.g. treat everyone (whether they be living people or spirits) 
with respect; be careful in the dark to know how you might get hurt and be 
careful; etc. You would learn by yourself with time what works for you and 
what doesn&#x27;t.

Right away I get turned off about someone when I read the numbers one, two 
and three below.  No matter how nice someone seems to be, it may not be 
so.  A rule I saw somewhere emphasized this - &quot;A person who is nice to you 
but is not nice to the waiter is NOT a nice person.&quot;

&gt; Hello Frank and All,
&gt; �
&gt; Dave and his wife Sharon are founders of the International Ghost Hunters Society.� They make a lot of money selling equipment, teaching and certifying people who are willing to pay the enormous prices they charge. They have also been around for quite a while.
&gt; �
&gt; I respect that they are serious researchers, however their newsbulletins (which I subscribe to out of curiosity) hit upon three points in every issue.
&gt; �
&gt; 1.� We went here and there and this is how great we are.
&gt; �
&gt; 2.� Everyone else sucks.
&gt; �
&gt; 3.� Buy our products and pay outrageous prices if you want to experience the paranormal the &#x27;right&#x27; way.
&gt; �
&gt; Other than that you&#x27;re not missing anything. The &#x27;Digcom&#x27; is overpriced. If you need to buy it because you can&#x27;t�make it yourself here then it is cheaper to buy it on ebay.�
&gt; �
&gt; Wish I had something�a little�more posititve�to say about Dave and Sharon. I have an associate who has gone on investigations with them and says they are good people.� I remind myself of that when reading their bulletins that rip others and checking out the prices they are charging.
&gt; �
&gt; I guess it is appropriate to add that in my group, two are certified parapsychologists and we teach paranormal studies in our area for FREE.� I also distribute to my 150 plus online members (FREE membership)�FREE downloads�(by permission of course) of Sarah Estep&#x27;s &#x27;Voices of Eternity&#x27; as well as the FREEware sound editing program Audacity with instructions for use authored by Shannon McCabe of HPI and�FREE downloads of paranormal paperwork (such as investigation interviewing questionnaires, permission and safety forms, etc...) because I believe in bringing this experience with EVERYONE, not just those with extra money, because who is that anyway(?). Not me for sure.
&gt; �
&gt; Anyway, I wish all�(whether solid�or ethereal) a safe and happy weekend.�
