It&#39;s just to save feelings, and \nembarrassment, and it&#39;s not appropriate.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  All should be careful of using other researchers names when being \ncritical.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  If anyone is getting threats of &quot;legal action&quot;, I suggest it be \nreported to the FBI, so at least a pattern can be established. I&#39;m \npretty sure most of this stuff comes from out of a persons home \nstate, that makes it federal. Slander is not even applicable to the \ninternet, so threats of slander suits are harrassment to keep people \nfrom contradicting certain claims and research in this field, and as \nsuch, criminal. Although these criminals think they can say whatever \nthey want about the rest of us. I suggest just let it go, and let the \nevidence speak for itself. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  These people that would like to keep all this research private, \nand for their own use are in fact in this group. To keep them off I \nwould have to make this a private group, or no group at all, and \nthat&#39;s not fair to the world. As I find out who these people are, \nthat are in the groop under false pretenses, they will be banned. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  If I feel threatened, or intimidated again, I will take \nappropriate action, and it won&#39;t involve whinning!  I can grow a pair \neven at my age!\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get the power of Windows + Web with the new Windows Live.\n&gt; http://www.windowslive.com?\nocid=TXT_TAGHM_Wave2_powerofwindows_122007\n&gt;"}
