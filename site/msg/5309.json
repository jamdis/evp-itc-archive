I know I can&#39;t.\n&gt;  \n&gt; they say necessity is the mother of invention\n&gt; and finding a readily available source of hackable radios\n&gt; was definitely necessary. You have just rekindled \n&gt; the hopes of quite a few aspiring researchers that have \n&gt; had no venue to get a box. without the inherent clicking that the \n&gt; new model 12-469 has after hacking.\n&gt;  \n&gt; great work !\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: urkel23@...: Fri, 11 Jan 2008 22:47:37 \n+0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] New Hack !!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I was bored on my day off today and picked up a radio and figured \nout the hack for it. It took me maybe 5 minutes or less. It has AM/FM \nand Shortwave. It also has a built in speaker and it was $39, so \nanyone that is having trouble finding the old style 12-469 and 12-470 \nhere is another model that is readily accessible. E-mail me privately \nfor details, i have to run at the moment and can&#39;t get into the hack. \nBut i will post the specifics when i get home. I&#39;m actually proud of \nmyself for figuring it out and not breaking it in the process.-Steve \nH. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Put your friends on the big screen with Windows Vista + Windows \nLive.\n&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/windows/shop/specialoffers.mspx?\nocid=TXT_TAGLM_CPC_MediaCtr_bigscreen_012008\n&gt;"}
