 Hard to hear in the cell phone video, but just had time to do a quickie d=
emo before having to run to work. Thought I might as well keep posting the =
information so it can be ripped off by the ones selling their stufff, and t=
hey can say how flawed my stuff is. I really don't mind others taking the i=
deas and making improvements, changes, and making a profit, but ya don't ha=
ve to beat me up in the process.  See the current TAPs paramag for the curi=
ous. I heard about it through someone that gets the mag, but don't know any=
thing first hand. I don't care that much to spend money to get magazine. Pa=
ranormal=3DHollywood=3D$$$. 
 
 I am well aware of the short comings of my =
equipment, I'm just honest enough not to sell it till it's perfected. I'm n=
ot an engineer, just a hillbilly techno droid trying satisfy her own curiou=
sity.
