post anything.

&gt;&gt; You know its kind of humorous for me that those who have the desire to
&gt;&gt; &quot;discuss&quot; thier different views are often the ones who do the least amount
&gt;&gt; of actual research... as long as you have been in this group not once have
&gt;&gt; you shared one evp. If you did then please refresh my memory. This seems to
&gt;&gt; more about commenting on what others share for you than it is about doing
&gt;&gt; any research yourself. Im not sure what you are looking for, if you are here
&gt;&gt; to learn, correspond, or if you are just here to get a rise out of others
&gt;&gt; but to be honest I do not have time for it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Whether Frank bans anyone or not is up to him entirely. But I have warned
&gt;&gt; you before and I am saying it again. Cut the crap and move on. That goes for
&gt;&gt; ALL of you. I dont mind discussions, I dont mind differences of opinion but
&gt;&gt; I do mind BS.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If you have research to share then do so, if your research yeilds no
&gt;&gt; results then state it as such. If your only purpose for being in this group
&gt;&gt; is to question others, disect them, and cause negative discussions then
&gt;&gt; perhaps you are wasting your time here. You are definitely wasting mine.
