Wow, that is quite an experience!






&gt; Carol,
&gt; Saging is good but if there is any fear or worry or concern about this
&gt; entity, the fear is enough to actually feed the entity strength. When I am
&gt; facing a &quot;hostile&quot; entity I literally step out of my &quot;self&quot; and one of my
&gt; Guides will step in an take command of whatever task we are trying to
&gt; complete.
&gt; The first time this happened was when my girl friend and I were on a date.
&gt; We had gone to play some games at one of Esther&#x27;s girlfriends house. The
&gt; girlfriend was &quot;possessed.&quot; The girl friend had a date and suddenly one of
&gt; my Guides mentioned that the young woman was possessed and needed to be
&gt; cleansed. The Guide also mentioned that the young woman&#x27;s date was a
&gt; minister-in-training at a small school nearby. But the guy was not yet
&gt; ready to face this type of event.
&gt; I was told to wait until he left and then the both of us could start the
&gt; possession ceremony. Once the guy left, Esther and I approached the young
&gt; woman and explained what we had been shown and asked her if she wished to
&gt; be cleansed. She said yes and asked us to start. It needs to be understood
&gt; that this young woman was in a wheel chair because she had some sort of
&gt; deformity of her legs and they were basically unusable.
&gt; Esther and I started with prayers. We asked to be covered with the white
&gt; light of the Ruach Ha-Kodesh (The Spirit, the Holy). The young woman
&gt; started to curse us in languages that we did not understand, nor cared
&gt; about. Eventually, the young woman levitated out of her wheel chair and
&gt; floated through her parents house. We walked behind her saying prayers.
&gt; Our prayers became so fervent that we understood that we were speaking to
&gt; one another by thought and not orally. Then I felt as if I was moved aside
&gt; in my spirit and a Guide came forward and commanded the spirit to leave.
&gt; The young woman then slowly settled back into her wheel chair, she gave
&gt; one more scream, and then she went limp. She feel into a really deep sleep
&gt; of exhaustion.
&gt; Esther tucked the girl friend into her bed covered her and stayed for the
&gt; rest of the evening. The next morning, they both went to church and the
&gt; young woman sang in her wheel chair as she had never had sung previously.
&gt; Full of joy and happiness.

&gt; I should have worded that better. What happened was that during and after
&gt; the sageing the energy really kicked it up several notches. I had placed
&gt; my emf meter on the end of my daughters bed. While sageing, I felt an
&gt; electrical type feeling start up the back of my hands..going all the way
&gt; to my chest. At that time, the emf meter had a sustained, high reading.
&gt; We continued to sage, and the emf meter was just buried in its
&gt; readings....I left the house...leaving the emf meter on and placing a dvr
&gt; on the bed also....we came back a couple hours later...the emf was reading
&gt; the usual low reading, and upon playback of the dvr you could hear the
&gt; beeping of my emf meter go crazy for about 20 minutes..after which it did
&gt; not beep again. So, I think the sageing actually stirred up the
&gt; entity....
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Carol, if you don&#x27;t mind my asking, how did the sage and salt &quot;feed&quot; the
&gt;&gt; energy?

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Well, first, we saged and salted. That really fed the energy to the
&gt;&gt; point
&gt;&gt; we had to leave the house for a few hours. We did the same thing again
&gt;&gt; and again. Then, a friend in CA called and together, on the phone, we
&gt;&gt; got
&gt;&gt; rid of it. You should have heard my emf meter beeping it&#x27;s freaking head
&gt;&gt; off while my friend sent his energy to get it to go. I had it on the end
&gt;&gt; of my daughters bed...where usually there is nothing to set it off. Boy,
&gt;&gt; did it ever react to the &quot;banishing&quot; for lack of a better word. My
&gt;&gt; friend
&gt;&gt; in CA is a sensitive, and helped me a great deal..I am forever thankful
&gt;&gt; for him.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Carol B.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I apologize, I didn&#x27;t know the extent of the matter, I also have a
&gt;&gt;&gt; friend
&gt;&gt;&gt; that had some nasty negative energy attach to them. I know what he went
&gt;&gt;&gt; through, and no one should have to go through that. I glad to hear you
&gt;&gt;&gt; got rid of it, and I hope it didn&#x27;t hurt your daughter. If you don&#x27;t
&gt;&gt;&gt; mind
&gt;&gt;&gt; me asking how you got rid of it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, it was not cool at all! This spirit attached to my 23 year
&gt;&gt;&gt; old
&gt;&gt;&gt; daughter in a very hostile and perverted way. I have an evp I got in
&gt;&gt;&gt; her
&gt;&gt;&gt; room...I had asked, &quot;Why are you here?&quot; I got &quot; to f--k.&quot; in a very
&gt;&gt;&gt; gutteral tone. It was awful. Thank God he is gone now and can never
&gt;&gt;&gt; return.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Carol B.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That sounds interesting, and Carol you said the spirit followed you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; home
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from Waverly... Thats cool, and I would try to get to know the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; energy/spirit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Andrea,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have experienced this before. In my case it had to do with a spirit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that attached itself to us while at Waverly. It became very strong,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had to have assistance to rid my home of him. We also experienced very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dense, black masses moving towards us.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Andrea,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sounds like a vortex may have been opening up in your hallway. Have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any paranormal ativity in your house before?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi All,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am Andrea Carr who is a 41 year old wife and mom of 1 daughter. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; am
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sorry
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have not written before but I have a terrible year and haven&#x27;t had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time to concentrate on EVP like I had prior. I won&#x27;t get into the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; details
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has left me in the midst of OK just trying to pull through all of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &amp;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I will get back to it when I can.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unfortunatley I am leaving for the weekend tomorrow morning and won&#x27;t
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; e-mails until Monday morning.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have a question for any one here. I believe in aliens, spirit and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ghost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; communications via evp but tonight I had an experience I never had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I woke up at exactly 2:22 by my stove&#x27;s clock and went and cleaned my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sink
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of dishes while I heated up some cream chipped beef (albiet not too
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exciting)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but while I sat there after in the dark with my family sleeping my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hallway
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ilummating a light clored blue several times. Anyone else ever seen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I look forward to any responses.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Andrea
