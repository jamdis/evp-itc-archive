&gt; &gt; Don&#x27;t know if anyone caught it, but Frank&#x27;s box was used on last
&gt; &gt; night&#x27;s episode of Paranormal State on A&amp;E. They were investigating
&gt; &gt; an old insane asylum, and they had Chris Moon as a guest  
&gt; investigator
&gt; &gt; with the box. You can see the promo clip here:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://www.pennstateprs.com/ps_asylum.mov
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here&#x27;s the site for the show itself:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://www.aetv.com/paranormal-state/index.jsp
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For those not familiar, its a half hour show that follows along the
&gt; &gt; &quot;Penn State Paranormal Research Society&quot; and different cases they  
&gt; take
&gt; &gt; on. Their niche in the &quot;paranormal reality tv show&quot; market is that
&gt; &gt; the group&#x27;s leader follows a more Christian orientated skew on
&gt; &gt; happenings. Lots of &quot;demons&quot; (they have Lorraine Warren guest all  
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; time), and they usually try to do investigations/communication only
&gt; &gt; during what they call &quot;dead time&quot;, 3am-4am, or &quot;the polar  
&gt; opposite of
&gt; &gt; 3pm - the time Jesus gave is life for all mankind&quot; as they put  
&gt; it. Oh,
&gt; &gt; and they have an &quot;occult specialist&quot; on the team that so far has  
&gt; been
&gt; &gt; anything but.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On the positive side, they did actually get (and record for later
&gt; &gt; analysis) live communication on the box in response to questions  
&gt; being
&gt; &gt; asked. And on the analysis and isolation of the recorded parts, you
&gt; &gt; could actually hear what was being said (as opposed to the usual of
&gt; &gt; Chris acting as a go-between for very distorted sounds like on those
&gt; &gt; youtube videos). So it was good to see it a)working in the &quot;field&quot;
&gt; &gt; and b)get some exposure on a tv show.
