If one thinks they just know, that might be considered ignorant.

&gt;   *Hey, hey, hey!*
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re ignorant at all, Frank. Don&#x27;t say those things.  ;)
&gt;
&gt; Not that it matters, but you&#x27;re not in any danger of pissing me off with
&gt; this stuff. I love what you have to say about these things, I enjoy the
&gt; dialogue immensely and I listen closely when you speak. I think you have a
&gt; very good, solid grasp when it comes to the boxes and who/what we&#x27;re
&gt; communicating with, what&#x27;s likely to be going on here and what their
&gt; abilities and limitations may be. I come here to learn from you (and
&gt; others) and to consider all of the angles in my attempt to further my own
&gt; experience and understanding about this stuff.
&gt;
&gt; At the end of the day, my guess is *NOT* as good as yours is, Frank. At
&gt; least not at this point.
&gt;
&gt; You&#x27;re probably right about the ET&#x27;s and I like to think in terms of levels
&gt; and layers as well. For the most part I think the boxes are tuning into a
&gt; very close spiritual level/layer/dimension and that SOME (&quot;some&quot;) of it
&gt; turns out to be astral junk and low-level entities maquerading as something
&gt; they&#x27;re not.
&gt;
&gt; (Come to think of it, maybe it&#x27;s *not* so different over there, lol!).
&gt;
&gt; That said, I know we can &quot;tune into&quot; and access all sorts of
&gt; these dimensions and levels of consciousness and the intelligent beings that
&gt; reside there with our sweeping radios. I think we&#x27;ve both had the experience
&gt; of speaking to loved ones who crossed over as well as ET&#x27;s, angels, spirit
&gt; guides and even plants, animals, the mineral kingdom and LIVING PEOPLE at
&gt; times too. I&#x27;m sure others have had these kinds of sessions as well and I
&gt; love hearing about our different experiences and thoughts on the subject.
&gt;
&gt; Part of my own work and meditations with the boxes reflect my own repeated
&gt; attempts to reach a higher level of intelligent being, a finer-faster energy
&gt; and more refined consciousness during my sessions and recordings. I
&gt; recognize it immediately when one of the &quot;dark dorks&quot; or low-level beings
&gt; creeps through...for me it&#x27;s still very much a &quot;hit or miss&quot; kinda deal and
&gt; I&#x27;m learning more all the time regarding how to increase my positive results
&gt; and consistency of good information coming through the boxes.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ve had several strong experiences with the boxes and messages that
&gt; may indicate or hint at something about to happen and then it did, but for
&gt; me it&#x27;s usually a few days or even a few weeks off (though there have been
&gt; cases when what they said would happen DID happen almost immediately - the
&gt; plane crash I spoke about a few weeks ago was one of them).
&gt;
&gt; It&#x27;s really hard for me to say much more than *&quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;* at this
&gt; point, which is why I take what you and the other members share here and
&gt; consider it along with everything else. It&#x27;s very helpful and I appreciate
&gt; what you have to say, Frank.
&gt;
&gt; I totally agree with you in that I also feel like ET&#x27;s being such *H*ighly
&gt; *E*volved *B*eings (or &quot;HEB&#x27;s&quot; as I like to call them) are more likely to
&gt; have a better grasp on the whole time-space issue as we know and experience
&gt; it while living on this planet.
&gt;
&gt; There have been sessions when I&#x27;ve asked the discarnate voices how long ago
&gt; they passed or how old they are/were or what day it is &quot;over there&quot; and many
&gt; times they seem unable to answer, hesitant at times, confused at others and
&gt; often completely un-aware (or possibly just un-interested) when it comes to
&gt; questions about their sense of time and how they experience and comprehend
&gt; such a thing.
&gt;
&gt; For the most part I&#x27;ve quit asking questions altogether and use my time
&gt; with the boxes to just listen for whatever they feel like addressing during
&gt; the session and recording.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for that!  :) :) :)
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ll end by saying I find these conversations of great value and importance
&gt; and I learn something new from you and the other members here every single
&gt; day. It&#x27;s all great food for thought and exactly the type of dialogue that
&gt; needs to take place if we&#x27;re ever going to get closer to the truth and a
&gt; real understanding of what&#x27;s going on here.
&gt;
&gt; I appreciate ya.
&gt;
&gt; Grateful,
&gt; Jerome

&gt;   I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s just the different level that come through. I
&gt; don&#x27;t want to like lay down what&#x27;s what, or try to be an authority. I don&#x27;t
&gt; know how this stuyff works, and I&#x27;ve pissed off enough people iun the
&gt; process.
&gt;
&gt;  My guys know what I&#x27;ll see and hear in the near future, and often feed it
&gt; to me ahaed of time, sometimes seconds, sometimes day and hours, just to
&gt; show. So everything I say is just my own expereince. Maybe ET has broader
&gt; vision? They *seem* to quite aware of what time it is, and how much is
&gt; left.
&gt;
&gt;  Ya have to keep in mind, I&#x27;m not educated, and not well traveled

&gt; &gt; wrote:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     Just my two cents and input based on what I get from my ancestral
&gt; guides and guardians...
&gt;
&gt; The spiritual dimension and those who reside there do not perceive &quot;time&quot;
&gt; as we do in the typical linear fashion. Remember the saying, *&quot;In the
&gt; twinkling of an eye?&quot;*
&gt;
&gt; 10,000 years here may only seem like a few precious moments over there, and
&gt; vice versa.
&gt;
&gt; They also remind me of the quantum field, string theory, our holographic
&gt; Universe (etc) and that *ALL time is &quot;ticking&quot;* (past, present &amp; future)
&gt; at the very same moment. It&#x27;s all happening RIGHT NOW in various levels,
&gt; layers, alternative realities and spiritual/energetic dimensions.
&gt;
&gt; The end of the Earth has already happened (for them and us!) in many ways.
&gt; Depending on who you&#x27;re speaking to, some even describe *what it was like*when the planet Earth was destroyed, speaking as though it has/had already
&gt; occured. There would also be dimensions in which this event has already
&gt; occured thousands of years ago, 5 minutes ago, 3 days from now and 10,000
&gt; years into the future and every other possible scenario.
&gt;
&gt; So which one is the RIGHT one then?
&gt;
&gt; Well, I think they all are.
&gt;
&gt; Because &quot;they&quot; live in a world of &quot;source energy&quot;, light, consciousness and
&gt; perfect information fields...one that&#x27;s so completely and totally different
&gt; to our own experience here/now and are not limited by linear time and
&gt; local/non-local space or relativity like we are, it&#x27;s likely very difficult
&gt; for most of the beings we would speak to through the box to give us specific
&gt; information regarding such an event or the exact time (or even &quot;which Earth&quot;
&gt; they are referencing, dimensionally speaking!).
&gt;
&gt; In other words, they don&#x27;t experience any of this stuff (and
&gt; especially &quot;time&quot;) like we do.
&gt;
&gt; To end, for several years now I&#x27;ve been a devoted care-giver to the ancient
&gt; quartz crystal skulls of Mayan legend and much of the mythologies and
&gt; folklore surrounding these objects is focused around 2012 and the
&gt; impending Great Shift. I&#x27;ve also studied South American culture (past and
&gt; present), anthropology, folklore and tribal customs along with their
&gt; indigenous wisdom systems in varying depth with the Kogi Indians, Quechua
&gt; Curanderos and residents of the Amazon.
&gt;
&gt; For many years I followed the work of Terence McKenna rather closely and
&gt; Terence is someone I consider a man-genius far ahead of his time (may he
&gt; rest in peace). He developed a time-mapping system based on the I-Ching, the
&gt; Mayan Calendar, Great Pyramids, DMT-beings, fractals, plant
&gt; consciousness and other mathematic systems that showed a sharp spike
&gt; followed by a near-perfect &quot;dip&quot; before it went off the charts and moved
&gt; into &quot;nothingness&quot; completely around December 21st, 2012...and even Terence
&gt; didn&#x27;t think this is when the world would end, necessarily.
&gt;
&gt; (His &quot;official&quot; position is that he simply didn&#x27;t know what to make of it
&gt; or expect. One theory is that his algorithms reflected such a change during
&gt; a time that humanity may have finally broken the time/space barrier and
&gt; uncovered the keys to time travel and 4th dimensional plane-shifting, to
&gt; name just one possible solution.).
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ve also been fortunate enough to live in Swaziland, South Africa with the
&gt; Swazi, Zulu, Xhosa and San Bushmen tribes who (like most other cultures
&gt; throughout time and history) also have their own teachings and mystery
&gt; traditions surrounding
&gt; this and other events.
&gt;
&gt; Given that the San are the most ancient tribal peoples and humanities
&gt; oldest ancestors still living in the world today and whose incredible
&gt; healing knowledge, spiritual wisdoms and mystical practices far exceed any
&gt; I&#x27;ve ever heard of or personally witnessed anywhere else in the world and
&gt; they don&#x27;t seem to feel that life on this planet is going to end anytime
&gt; soon, so I&#x27;m not going to panic just yet.
&gt;
&gt; These amazing people have their ears pressed up very closely to the
&gt; heartbeat and rhythms of Mother Earth and told me firsthand that before the
&gt; end comes certain events will take place on a scale the whole world will be
&gt; instantly made aware of...events that could still take several hundred or
&gt; even thousands of years to unfold.
&gt;
&gt; All I know for my own self, personally, is that I have no clue what&#x27;s going
&gt; to happen...but it will be okay, no matter what takes place. There are worst
&gt; things than dying, believe me...and part of what makes our work with the
&gt; Ghost Box and ITC in general so helpful and inspiring is that we can find a
&gt; level of peace and comfort through our sessions and recordings we might
&gt; actually need one day, whether soon or in some distant time - we&#x27;re all
&gt; going to end up there eventually, no doubt about it!
&gt;
&gt; *FINAL NOTE:* I don&#x27;t have all the answers...I don&#x27;t even have all the
&gt; questions, and I know it. My guess is as good as any and I could be
&gt; completely and totally WRONG about all of this (I&#x27;m open to that and I&#x27;m
&gt; perfectly fine with it). Believe you me, if the world ends when a lot
&gt; of folks think it might I&#x27;ll be just as surprised as anyone. Until then I&#x27;ll
&gt; keep doing what I do now; realizing that I don&#x27;t know a damn thing, taking
&gt; life as it comes to me day by precious day, treating it with respect and
&gt; honoring my experience here as the gift it is, loving others, being good to
&gt; the people around me and enjoying my family and time spent here while I can.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; And I won&#x27;t be afraid...not even for one second or when I&#x27;m looking up and
&gt; seeing that big f***ing rock heading right towards us, hahaha. For all I
&gt; know (or anyone here for that matter), I could be blindsided by a Mac truck
&gt; later this evening!
&gt;
&gt; Many of the people worried over 2012 won&#x27;t even be here when 2012
&gt; arrives...now how&#x27;s THAT for a mind-f**k!?!?
&gt;
&gt; ;)

&gt;
&gt; Remember last year when we both got the August predictions? That didn&#x27;t pan
&gt; out, so i wouldn&#x27;t take what they say too seriously. They have never said
&gt; anything that came true yet, i don&#x27;t think they can.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m pretty sure that they can&#x27;t tell the future, so when they say stuff i
&gt; think they are just messing with us to see what we do with the information.
&gt; They might even be laughing at us !

Jus my wo cen s and inpu based on wha I ge om my ances al guides and gua dians...
 
The spi i ual dimension and hose who eside he e do no  pe cei e &quot; ime&quot; as we do in  he ypical linea ashion. Remembe he saying, &quot;In he winkling o an eye?&quot;
 
10,000 yea s he e may only seem like a ew p ecious momen s o e   he e, and ice e sa. 
 
They also emind me o he quan um ield, s ing heo y, ou  holog aphic Uni e se (e c) and ha ALL ime is &quot; icking&quot; (pas , p esen  &amp; u u e) a he e y same momen . I &#x27;s all happening RIGHT NOW in a ious le els, laye s, al e na i e eali ies and spi i ual/ene ge ic dimensions.

 
The end o he Ea h has al eady happened ( o hem and us!) in many ways. Depending on who you&#x27; e speaking  o, some e en desc ibe wha i was like when  he plane Ea h was des oyed, speaking as hough i has/had al eady occu ed. The e would also be dimensions in which his e en has al eady occu ed housands o yea s ago, 5 minu es ago, 3 days om now and 10,000 yea s in o he u u e and e e y o he possible scena io. 

 
So which one is he RIGHT one hen? 
 
Well, I hink hey all a e. 
 
Because &quot; hey&quot; li e in a wo ld o &quot;sou ce ene gy&quot;, ligh , consciousness and pe ec  in o ma ion ields...one ha &#x27;s so comple ely and o ally di e en o ou own expe ience he e/now and a e no limi ed by linea ime and local/non-local space o ela i i y like we a e, i &#x27;s likely e y di icul o mos o he beings we would speak o h ough he box o gi e us speci ic in o ma ion ega ding such an e en o he exac ime (o e en &quot;which Ea h&quot; hey a e e e encing, dimensionally speaking!). 

 
In o he wo ds, hey don&#x27; expe ience any o his s u (and especially &quot; ime&quot;) like we do.  
 
To end,  o se e al yea s now I&#x27; e been a de o ed ca e-gi e o he ancien qua z c ys al skulls o Mayan legend and much o he my hologies and olklo e su ounding hese objec s is ocused a ound 2012 and he impending G ea Shi .

All I know o my own sel , pe sonally, is ha I ha e no clue wha &#x27;s going o happen...bu i will be okay, no ma e wha akes place.

FINAL NOTE: I don&#x27; ha e all he answe s...I don&#x27; e en ha e all he ques ions, and I know i . My guess is as good as any and I could be comple ely and o ally WRONG abou all o his (I&#x27;m open o ha and I&#x27;m pe ec ly ine wi h i ).
