I don&#39;t dislike him, but he is no Art Bell. Art was a legend, but Noory is a tad too narcissistic for my taste, always seeking validation from guests that he has some superintuitive skill. Back in the Bell days, I usually listened most every night, because the guests were thought provoking and his interviewing style made the shows legendary. Noory unfortunately can have a brilliant guest lineup and still make the show a snoozer. \n\nI am rambling on, but I thought the segment was a good one, if not long enough. Hell they could have devoted the whole show to you and Bill and I would have been happy.\n\nAndy\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; To be fair, they claim they never received the voice files.
