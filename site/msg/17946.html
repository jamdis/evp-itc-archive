 RJ, I do not need to post things all over the net, I only took the time=
 to locate some old files from last year just for you, not for glory dear h=
eart.=C2=A0 And if you took the time to listen you would see in the message=
s that the girl had not yet been found, she as she was only missing one day=
, I got this all on the first day from spirit, and I asked spirit if I shou=
ld call it in, which i did, the police did not know it was from Spirit, he =
thought it was just people talking in a bar or something, I did not tell hi=
m what it was, but he took down the information, I am not claiming to have =
been the clue for the people at all, but they did find her body right in th=
e wall and the guy that killed her was indeed the same name given by the sp=
irit, there are people on the these lists that do remember this, but I thin=
k it was Bruce's list, he could verify it please don't keep bothering me wi=
th such mundane talk, i am not going to respond anymore to you, this is sil=
ly, if I cannot convince you, then I leave it in the hands of the Great Alm=
ighty, Peace lets be still, sf

You keep saying you don't need to prove this stuff, then you keep try=

 produce the police report.=C2=A0 And I'll bet there was not one mention in=
 a newspaper that the case was solved by EVPs.=C2=A0 Must be a conspiracy :=

We can also not confirm that the stuff you are telling the police wasn't=
 already all over the news: which is how I've noticed many EVP interpretati=

So if you have =
a prediction,=C2=A0 post it far and wide, if you think it could help people=
 or save their lives.=C2=A0 What does it say about you, if could have helpe=
d people, and turned your back?

It's this kind of thing that turns believe=
rs, and even open-minded people, into skeptics.

the time to locate some old files from last year just for you, not for glor=

 messages that the girl had not yet been found, she as she was only missing=
 one day, I got this all on the first day from spirit, and I asked spirit i=
f I should call it in, which i did, the police did not know it was from Spi=
rit, he thought it was just people talking in a bar or something, I did not=
 tell him what it was, but he took down the information, I am not claiming =
to have been the clue for the people at all, but they did find her body rig=
ht in the wall and the guy that killed her was indeed the same name given b=
y the spirit, there are people on the these lists that do remember this, bu=
