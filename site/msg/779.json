I remember you getting the open box messages and trying to make it work. I am like you I usually dont understand what is being said until a later date. I too have had messages changed often its just one or two words but now and then the &quot;editor&quot; really goes at it and changes the entire message completely until there is very little trace evidence of the original message.\n   \n  I asked them once why this happens and was told that sometimes folks make mistakes\n   \n  LOL I guess thats true when I write an email often the thought I first type is not always what makes it thru to the final send, I go back and I correct the mistake or change the wording. It still amazes me sometimes the degree of changes that can happen. Another reason why I try to save everything to backup.\n   \n  Misty\n  Oh and P.S. Im a girl and I&#39;m your friend LOL\n\nFrank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n          I kept getting this nmessage for years, thinking it was the echo box they \nwanted open.
