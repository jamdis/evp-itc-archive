I am disabled from toxins I breathed \nat ground zero during rescue and recovery efforts, I was a first \nresponder so we got the worst of it and it has left me with a lung \ndisease and two heart attacks but I&#39;m not handicaped I have total \nmobility I just have to take it easy. So as you may see I have alot of \ntime for experimenting and have been doing evp research as well as itc \nfor some time now and your box has touched a special cord with me it \njust feels like I should have and be using one. Don&#39;t ask me to explain \nit&#39;s just this wierd feeling like something is telling me you are meant \nto use this tool. If you can ever see your way clear as to building one \nfor me I would be more than glad to pay for your time labor and \nmaterials and would be forever appreciative.\n\nyour friend \nBruce Halliday"}
