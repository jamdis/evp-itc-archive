&gt; Frank,
&gt; To someone that we all look up to as an insperation I can say that  
&gt; you can make the best box ever and the results might just depend on  
&gt; the person or user of the product...
&gt; Keep working in this direction, keep being a good person.  Remember  
&gt; one thing, we are the light in the darkness!  There will always be  
&gt; people that will try to rain on OUR parade.  We have to be the  
&gt; voice of reason so WE can move forward.  This is not about us!  Its  
&gt; about TRUTH and the light and research.  Thanks for everything you  
&gt; have done and continue to do!!
&gt; I think personally that these devices work best when the user is  
&gt; not using the device for personal gain, but for everyones best  
&gt; intrests!!
&gt;
&gt; Happy New Year!

&gt; I don&#x27;t know if maybe the audio pick up from the box wasn&#x27;t very good,
&gt; but I can&#x27;t make out much of that either. It sounds like the  
&gt; recordings
&gt; I do with a cell phone. I think you&#x27;d have to be there to judge it.
&gt;
&gt; Personally I&#x27;m always disappointed at my stuff being out there, and
&gt; the incredible lack of clarity obatained with it, to me that&#x27;s a huge
&gt; failure! I know the stuff works, but how to get it to a level that can
&gt; be understood by most, that&#x27;s the problem, and my focus at the moment.
&gt; The Mini Box is big step in that direction, so some of the pressure if
&gt; off, but I still need to get my boxes to professional level.
