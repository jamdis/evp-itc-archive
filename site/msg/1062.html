Here is an example recording from today. This is a prototype dual phototransistor optical mic. It&#x27;s a very simple device. I turned up the levels on the radio and now I can hear some &#x27;control tones&#x27; between voices. I have heard these tones in the past very faint. The first voice is robotic the second normal
&quot;Good testing his circuit....That&#x27;s awesome&quot;

Yes, the speaker is about a foot from the lamp/phototransistor combo. Volume has to be adjusted so the mic does not overload, it is a touchy adjustment of audio and flame level. If the flame is set too high the unit generates lots of noise from the flutter of the flame. Also the room should be dark and computer monitor turned down to reduce noise the mic will pick up produced stray light sources.

So you play the audio from the radio out in the room, and record with the 
optic setup?
