<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just look at the date to see the 2 files from today.  I was verifying 
communication for others to hear.  So i used Babs as an example of an 
uncommon name as well as mine and bruce&#x27;s name.  The first file 
probably got lost on this board at this point with all the audio 
uploads recently....JULI !!!!!  Just kidding, but listen to the 2 new 
files from today in the folder and let me know what you guys think.  I 
already know i have good communication with my two friends on the other 
side named Mike and Lisa, but i want to show others that what i get is 
real.  If anybody wants to do a test session through Skype just e-mail 
me and we can set something up.

Thanx,
-Steve H.</pre>
