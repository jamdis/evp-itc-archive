&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; Im still new to this. Ive been recording for a year. I first 
started getting phone contact in the 80s but didnt know what was 
happening. This time I did(well as much as I can) I am , like 
lunalamia, concerned for the greater good..although I have become 
fairly close to a couple of my other worldly friends. I look forward 
to learning and sharing. I am adding a small segmant of something 
from this last weekend.

&gt;  &gt; Hello to everyone that is joining our group. Feel free to jump 
in on 
&gt;  the conversations, ask questions or just look around. For those 
of you 
&gt;  who would like to see what people are up to you may want to set 
your 
&gt;  group settings to &quot;individual email&quot; settings for the postings 
&gt;  otherwise you will not recieve message attachments of thier evp 
sound 
&gt;  files. Most file sharing is done this way here.
