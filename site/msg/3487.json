For one person to say he is the &quot;primary tester&quot;=\r\n is inaccurate, he was the first that kinda understood how it was supposed =\r\nto be used, or so I thought. I think we left the &quot;treting phase&quot; some time =\r\nago, perhaps it&#39;s time to return barrowed equipment?\n \n I wasn&#39;t quite fini=\r\nshed with that e-mail-- I hit the send button in my rush to get off to work=\r\n. \n \n \n \n I put out a box use guideline thing a year or two ago stating tha=\r\nt no one has the right to take my equipment and and claim their use superce=\r\ndes anyones else&#39;s use, or results.\n \nSo, to contiue...\n \n As a far as &quot;tec=\r\nhnicians&quot; I don&#39;t get any of that stuff, but---they do talk about a network=\r\n, and connection to our equipment. When I first made my &quot;Ghostman&quot; box, las=\r\nt week, it wasn&#39;t working well, but a day or so later, it came to life, and=\r\n one of the voices said it had been connected to &quot;the network&quot;. Supposedly =\r\nthere is a similar connection made to computers running EVPmaker. I&#39;m not s=\r\nure if these &quot;network&quot; connections are maintained if equipment is taken out=\r\n for investigations, or demostrations. Of cousre, I can&#39;t say if these netw=\r\norks are a fact. I would think as maker of the box, these etheric techs mig=\r\nht want to give me, or others some hints.\n \n As far as the ghost box, or Fr=\r\nank&#39;s box, being a &quot;telephone to the dead&quot;, I think is very poor analogy, t=\r\nhe old style phone system of Edison&#39;s day had operators, plural, not one pe=\r\nrson that recieved all calls, then interpreted what was being said to other=\r\n parties. That&#39;s more of a master control schema.The old phone system didn&#39;=\r\nt charge you an arm and a leg to talk to someone in the same room either! S=\r\nome might say these &quot;Technicains&quot; are the operators, but even if anyone esl=\r\ne could hear these voices, why do you need someone to interpret what&#39;s bein=\r\ng said. I say if not many can hear it, or something similar, it ain&#39;t real!=\r\n There is a certain kind of conatct, ion that that your own mind uses the n=\r\noise as a sort of psychic prop, you hear the stuff in your head, it may be =\r\naccurate and real inforamntiion, but no one else is going to hear it. i thi=\r\nnk that what all this supposed converstions wiht Edison maybe.  I have in f=\r\nact heard a voice that said &quot;Edison here&quot; but there was no other real infor=\r\nmation conveyed that I could understand. \n As for portals, demons and evil =\r\nspirits entering the world through these &quot;unauthorized&quot; boxes, I an only sa=\r\ny, as the original mker of the box, I have gotten voices cuzzing, swearing,=\r\n name calling, and even threatening, but nothing that has seemingly &quot;entere=\r\nd&quot; our world. Even those &quot;threatening entities&quot;, when pressed to bring it, =\r\nfold up like paper tigers. These beings and spirits already exist all aroun=\r\nd us, and at a higher level, so they have full access to this, a lower leve=\r\nr. Besides. There is that &quot;network&quot; that seem to allow for better contacts,=\r\n and kinda helps highter being to come through. \n \n I made these &quot;boxes&quot;! T=\r\nhe idea was not &quot;Edisons Telephone...&quot; What I got was an assemblage of my o=\r\nwn expereince and knowlegde, put together by my own mind as answer to my qu=\r\nestion of what else could I use for spirit comuncation. All technology invo=\r\nlved was based on what I had worked on in the past for radio experimentatio=\r\nn. I had in fact, a couple years before my interest in EVP, been experiment=\r\ning with voltage tunable radio modules removed from car stereos for AM DX, =\r\nthat&#39;s listening to distant AM radio stations. I was hoping to find other t=\r\nalk shows similar to Art Bell, and there used to be one out of Cincinati(?)=\r\n. The idea of using a random voltage to tune the radio was after using EVPm=\r\naker, which uses a method of generating random speech bits for the entities=\r\n to use. It was a small leap to apply the random technique to an anolog sys=\r\ntem. I am not the first to be focusing on a problem, and have the mind prov=\r\nide an solution in complete form. Nothing mystical about it. The fact is, a=\r\nfter much work, and experimenting, the tuning doesn&#39;t have to be random, a =\r\nlinear tuning works much better. Yet another fact of  the box, covienently =\r\nignored.\n \n What really chaps my hide, as maker of the box, is to have some=\r\none, who knows nothing of electronics, and technology completely ignore eve=\r\nrything I say about the box, and presume to tell me how it really works, ho=\r\nw it should be used, and what is acceptable from it. This guy is so honest,=\r\n he won&#39;t even use his real name, but huff and puff at at anyone that contr=\r\nadicts his use of my equipment. I say, as &quot;a Tester&quot; if you can&#39;t use it in=\r\n an honest manor, bring the stuff back--testing over! Like it or not, the p=\r\nublic has this technology, you can keep pissing and moaning, trying to spre=\r\nad fear, or you could choose the way of Light. \n \n Frank-S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________=\r\n________________________________________________________\nShare life as it h=\r\nappens with the new Windows Live.Download today it&#39;s FREE!\nhttp://www.windo=\r\nwslive.com/share.html?ocid=3DTXT_TAGLM_Wave2_sharelife_112007\r\n--_25a661c5-1527-49ba-9dce-50da491b4e99_\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;\n.hmmessage P\n{\nmargin:0px;\npadding:0px\n}\nbody.hmmessa=\r\nge\n{\nFONT-SIZE: 10pt;\nFONT-FAMILY:Tahoma\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body class=3D&#39;=\r\nhmmessage&#39;&gt;\n&nbsp;I did, from the begining open this to anyone, and I am no=\r\nt amused that one person would take the technogoly, claim it as his own, an=\r\nd attempt to make it exclusive to himself.
