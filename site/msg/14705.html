Well, stand outside the thing, and help those  poor souls out, here they 
are making money at the cost of lost souls who are  asking for help.  Shame on 
them, don't they realize  how many lost  souls there are out there, 
waiting, go back (a few thousand years worth of  them,)  were I to name all the 
tribes, country, religions, throughout the  years, people that died trapped, in 
various places over century's, and yes there  are thousand's of them in the 
world, just dwelling in a cell of their own  making, no progression, no 
light, no hope, without people they love, and  who wait still loving them, they 
exist in these dark places without  God.  This mission should be to help 
them get back to God, back to the  light of God, light of Universe however, we 
want to call it, but in that light  is love and happiness.  Just my take, sf

Yes, you need special permission. I was there for an all night ghost hunt  
as a guest of Eastern Paranormal. The place can be rented at night but 
believe  me when I say "it ain't cheap". Plus I don't think the prison would 
appreciate  me releasing the inmates before their eternal sentence has been  
served.
Steve

Does one need special permission to get in  there?  You folks should go 
back, and release them since a few of them  already know you Steve, this is 
Steve?  Right?  sf

Unfortunately I did not get to attempt to cross them. After my  
demonstration, another group that was also there started complaining that  the box made 
too much noise and was hendering their investigation so I  turned it off. I 
wouldn't want my direct communication with the  deceased inmates to mess up 
their EVP work, now would I? I apoligized and  put it away for the rest of 
the night.
 According to the prison staff, the inmates firmly believed that  if they 
died in prison their souls would be forever trapped there. This  belief was 
so strong that the prison officials would take the elderly  inmates who were 
dying of natural causes to a local hospital so  they would'nt have to die in 
the prison. Maybe their beliefs were well  founded.

This is a wonderful recording, were you  able to free any of them?  So sad 
to see them still there behind bars,  must be very lonely for them, they 
should be moving on so, they can start to  work on making up for things on the 
other side.  You folks should go up  there again, and hold a small prayer 
vigil for them, of course they would no  longer be ghosts trapped there, but 
there are plenty more around.  sf

I was invited to spend the night in the West Virginia Penitentiary this  
past weekend.. I was asked to give a short demonstration with my Optimus  
12-797 hacked radio. Deep inside the prison surrounded by concrete and  steel, 
the radio could not pick up any radio stations in manual mode. I  wasn't sure 
how this might effect the demonstration. I was pleasantly  surprised with 
the results. I recorded the session and the results can be  heard at this 
link. _http://www.youtube. com/watch?  v=KwDYu4RULlk_
