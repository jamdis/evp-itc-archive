<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m totally in favor of prayer protection, white light, saging, ect...

It works on many levels. Better if we focus on what we want, instead 
of what we don&#x27;t. Law of attraction in action!

&gt; Frank,

&gt; That is very true there is an abundance of taps and most haunted 
influence on most new investigators
&gt; and researchers coming into the field. A lot of the new researchers 
will have the luxury of starting and learning about
&gt; evp using a box now that the RS is available. It&#x27;s a shame because 
I believe those of us that put their time in the 
&gt; trenches when there where no boxes just cassette recorders and then 
dvr&#x27;s and you had to pray that the voices 
&gt; were loud enough and clear enough to attempt to understand. I have 
been doing evp research for a little under ten
&gt; years and have experimented with every type of method of audio and 
visual itc and evp and only one time using a joe&#x27;s box 
&gt; did Steve and myself experience a peculiar and suspicious 
occurrence, when both our Joe&#x27;s boxes where fried within 2 days 
&gt; of each other. other than that only the occasional curse word or 
nasty response. If anyone that is attempting or contemplating
&gt; doing research with a box, if you are concerned about dark heads 
just say a short protection prayer before each session and that will 
help
&gt; to calm your fears.

&gt;  I use my stuff with the Grandkids in the room, never--never--never-
-has there been a problem. The disclaimer is no doubt one of those 
just incase things. All this stuff is brand new, the theory behind it 
scetchy at best, and the infromation for site to will be inconsitent. 
It seems some expect it to be gospel truth, right off the bat. I&#x27;m 
still seeing alot of Hollywood at work here.   Frank-S

&gt; I pulled this list of general recommendations for The MiniBox right 
off Ron&#x27;s www.paranormalsystems.com page -1. Do not allow children 
under the age of 16 to use this device 2. Although individual 
sessions are effective, group sessions are more productive.3. This is 
not an &#x27;electronic Ouija board&#x27; - no harm can come from using it. 4. 
Some voices will use coarse language so be prepared for it. 5. Always 
use a recorder to tape all sessions 6. Keep a notebook with the times 
and locations of your sessions. 7. The MiniBox will call you by name 
so don&#x27;t be startled by it. Lance
