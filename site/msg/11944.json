I&#39;m a Spiritualist. As a matter of fact, I will be in Lily  \nDale, NY (The Village of Spirits) at the end of Sept. for a workshop  \non Mediumship. Anyone want to join me? Come on Misty! Wouldn&#39;t we have  \na blast? What a place to record.\n\nAnyway, I mention Spiritualism as it&#39;s practice has helped me in my  \nresearch and due to the non-dogmatic structure, leaves my mind open to  \nponder without setting boundaries or labels on spirit. Spiritualism  \noverseas is fabulous. Especially in the UK & Ireland. The talk of such  \nthings is much more accepted and how I love that. No silly  \nsuperstitious tags and spirit is greatly respected and paid attention  \nto.\n\nMy dealings with Findhorn (in Scotland) have helped immensely in my  \nunderstanding of the Elemental and Devic energies I&#39;ve often been told  \nI&#39;m recording. Am I positive I&#39;m recording these certain energies  \ncalled Devas, Faeries, and Elementals? Nope. That&#39;s just what they  \ntell me. I&#39;m told all sorts of things and always take them in stride.\n\nDo I combine my Spiritualism with my EVP/ITC research? Nope. Not  \nalways, but sometimes. I like solid evidence that can be analyzed and  \nscientific evidence. I like to be able to record something I can hand  \nover on a brand new audio tape and have it analyzed or ask what the  \nchances are that stray radio signals are calling out my name and  \nanswering my questions in real time. Or simply answer them with no  \nradio at all - just a faucet trickling or no sound whatsoever.\n\nWhat about others here? Do you combine your beliefs with your  \nrecording or stay completely scientific?\n\nWisteria"}
