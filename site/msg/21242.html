<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I know I don&#x27;t post as much as I should here, but I think this is important.
 Recently there has been talk about the sweep rates of various boxes and how
they respond in the AM and FM bands.  I am not sure how many of you know
this, but Adriana has come up with a method to calculate the sweep rate of
the different hacks:

 http://itcvoices.org/?p=60

Why don&#x27;t we all calculate the the sweep rates of the various boxes?  I
would like to put up a chart on the itcvoices website that has the sweep
rate for each type of hack.  That way we can have a mathematical
representation of how fast these boxes stay on any one frequency.  This
would require those with turbo hacks to measure the rate with and without
the turbo.  Creating this chart will lend a lot of credence to what we do.

In addition to the rate, I would also like to post 1 minute of pure audio
from each box sweeping, both in the FM and AM bands.  So not only can we
have a figure for the sweep, but also how the hack sounds.

Also welcome is a minute of any Frank&#x27;s Box, Rich&#x27;s Box, or other unique Box
construction.

Does anybody want to help with this?  It will benefit everybody

Here is a list of known hacks, any others are certainly welcome!
