<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;d agree to that. He shares his research, never charges for anything,
freely admits there are no &quot;experts&quot; in this field (he does not even
consider himself an expert).
I grow more and more concerned about the hatred and viciousness I see from
and among some &quot;paranormal researchers.&quot; It is not everybody by any means,
but it seems to exceed the average amount of this I see in other fields. I
wonder why this is? Is it perhaps in fact because everyone deep down inside
knows there are no experts in this field and those who try to present
themselves as such know deep down inside they are presenting a false image?

&gt;    Arrogant!? Sumption? You have a warped view of Sumption if you see
&gt; arrogance. He is in your face and speaks his mind but he has never claimed

&gt; who claim to be experts? Hell yeah! That&#x27;s one of the reason we like him.

&gt;    Hi All
&gt;
&gt; I have to admit that I share the same opinion as Bruce. I dont what
&gt; everyones take is on this but I felt that some of moon and even Franks
&gt; attitude was slightly arrogant. I am a researcher in the UK using old reel
&gt; to reel methods and obtaining excellent results. I lost some family and some
&gt; close friends 5 yeara ago and suddenly it dawned on me...what is life all
&gt; about. I went on to research every evp pioneer i could, listen to hours/days
&gt; of recordings and it changed my outlook on life. tears were turned to smiles
&gt; and then I realised what all this research is for. it was a big step for me
&gt; spiritually.
&gt;
&gt; I dont know if there is anyone else on here using old fashioned methods but
&gt; if anybody would like to hear recordings please ask. I am using a reel to
&gt; reel sony &quot;Hi frequency&quot; recorder and trying various types of tones,
&gt; backgrounds e.t.c.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck to everyone with their research, you are right we are changing
&gt; history we are discovering new things. if it wasnt for individuals such as
&gt; raudive, jurghenson to name a few, maybe we wouldnt have discovered this. it
&gt; takes a brave individual to tackle an arrogant human race blunted with
&gt; science.
&gt;
&gt; Kind Regards
&gt;
&gt; The quiet one :-)

&gt;  *Sorry to hear this Bruce, I sure hope things get better,  I had no idea
&gt; there were so many problems when I joined all these lists,  I think you are
&gt; all great people, you folks together are making history don&#x27;t you all
&gt; realize this?  There are so many people out there that have never heard of
&gt; this type of communication, thousands out there!  My friend just lost her
&gt; mother a couple of weeks ago, when I told her about the work you all are
&gt; doing, tears were replaced with a smile, she is looking forward to hearing
&gt; from her mom now too.  Stop trying to hurt each other, it&#x27;s not worth it,
&gt; life is too short for this stuff.  You are all great people, May God Bless

&gt; guys,
&gt;
&gt; Sorry to burden you with this nonsense but this group and the RTSC group
&gt; are my only venues to respond to posts on other groups and have my account
&gt; heard, I hope you do not mind to much.
&gt;
&gt; Here is a copy of my final personal e-mail to Frank Sumption which by the
&gt; way is meant for him but he see&#x27;s fit to post them publicly in an attempt to
&gt; discredit me.
&gt;
&gt; I want you to read it first hand so there are no chance of it being altered
&gt; before it is posted else where.
&gt;
&gt; I will not address Frank again
&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -
&gt;
&gt; Frank,
&gt;
&gt; This is getting ridiculous now, you should stop writing these posts, all
&gt; you are doing is making yourself look ridiculous.
&gt;
&gt; I have offered many times to make my raw recordings available for review by
&gt; anyone who wants them. I have made the same challenge to your friend moon
&gt; who we all know is behind this tirade he has time and again refused or
&gt; ignored the request for any type of audio file
&gt; to be publicly posted for revue and continues to take advantage of innocent
&gt; unsuspecting people with his con game and charging large amounts of money
&gt; for sessions where he fabricates and makes up content as he goes along.
&gt;
&gt; I was the only one to confront him in public and expose him for the fake he
&gt; is and this is his feeble attempt at retaliation. I and other researchers
&gt; like me have brought this research light years from where it was when you
&gt; and I first met, moon just continues to use it to rip people off and has not
&gt; contributed a thing to the research of ghost box communication beside lining
&gt; his own pockets.
&gt;
&gt; Just the fact that he has you doing his dirty work shows the type of guy he
&gt; is. I can remember a time when you publicly came out against any type of
&gt; money making using your boxes and even refused moon when he wanted to
&gt; manufacture and sell them for large profits yet now you condone his robbery
&gt; of innocent unaware people and actually act foolish on his behest.
&gt;
&gt; Frank you are better than this, just concentrate on developing a better box
&gt; and forget about moon and his tricks and lies, he is finished in the
&gt; paranormal and he knows it, everyone is wise to his game and he is
&gt; practically an outcast.
&gt;
&gt; Frank you are hitching you wagon to a dead horse. Get away from these bad
&gt; influences before they ruin your reputation as well.
&gt;
&gt; We have had this moon discussion in the past and once he has exhausted his
&gt; need for you he will screw you again like he has done so many times before.
&gt;
&gt; Frank, I like and respect you and I hope you will consider what I have said
&gt; in this e-mail and I sincerely hope you post this one on the evp-itc group.
&gt; I will be posting it on my group and others I belong to.
&gt;
&gt; Your former friend
&gt; Bruce
