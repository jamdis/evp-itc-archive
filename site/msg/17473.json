The boxes are hella expensive, and I was lucky e=\r\nnough to find a man selling one who really needed the money at the time so =\r\nI got a great deal.\n\nThey are made by Ron Ricketts of Paranormal Systems ou=\r\nt of Texas. As the story goes, Ron is an electrical engineer and a member o=\r\nf paranormal group. They group he is with wanted to explore the Frank&#39;s Box=\r\n phenomena so he built one based on Frank&#39;s schematics a couple of years ag=\r\no to find out what the fuss was about. Liking what he heard, he decided to =\r\ngo into business by making these boxes for production. The circuit boards a=\r\nre pressed, the whole unit is in a pre-fab plastic case. It runs AM band on=\r\nly, the antennae is internal (with crystal enhancement) connected to an out=\r\nside post extension, has seven different frequencies sweeping modes, user f=\r\nrequency sweep rate adjustments, and it has an internal battery. Interestin=\r\ngly enough, my internal antennae broke the solder point internally from the=\r\n post and it gets even better reception now. \n\nThe Minibox has an internal =\r\namplifer (300mW) which is enough to power a small external speaker badly. T=\r\nhe reason my files are so clear is because I run my sessions very different=\r\nly than other Minibox users. I take the amp out from the box and run it int=\r\no an external 7 watt / 4 ohm amp designed by Ron to work with this box. I l=\r\nike having the amplified sound, but the internal amp is noisy so when this =\r\nnoise is amplified, I get a lot of hiss. But, it also allows me to achieve =\r\nreally loud volume. The louder I make the volume, the lower I can set the s=\r\nensitivity and still be able to hear it. The box itself has two knobs, volu=\r\nme and sensitivity. So I set the sensitivity to the point where it gates ou=\r\nt most sound, then I tweak it gently while I crank the volume. My hand is a=\r\nlways on the sensitivity knob and I cannot explain it, but I &quot;feel&quot; when to=\r\n open the gate a little more to add in some more sound and when to back off=\r\n and close the gate some more to cut out\n sound.\n\nThis is how I keep all ot=\r\nher frequencies out and limit radio chatter considerably. I have found that=\r\n the Others have learned to work this box with me. It took time, a little o=\r\nver a month or so of using it every night until I could communicate clearly=\r\n using this box. I have often asked them before if they want me to switch t=\r\no a different mode of frequency sweeping (I currently use random jump) and =\r\nI always get &quot;No&quot; as a reply. They seem to be happy with the way it works n=\r\now, I only wish that some of their replies did not get cut off. \n\nAs a resu=\r\nlt, the responses take a little longer, as you can hear, some sentences for=\r\nm over several seconds, but they are often very clear individual words or p=\r\nhrases. They have told me that the clicking sound you hear is them trying t=\r\no manipulate the sound so they can speak.\n\nAs for recording, I record with =\r\na standard sony stereo digital recorder set up about 3 feet from the speake=\r\nr, and I do my editing in Audition. Nothing has been manipulated, just slic=\r\ned and put into a file.\n\nTim W.\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;draiga1&quot; &lt;=\r\nblackwing@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Those are really clear files Tim!
