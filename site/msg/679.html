Now I hear this very different from the other day &quot;you are the key to this 
(Reversed) they&#x27;re coming to know&quot;. I don&#x27;t like attention, and definitely 
not the center of anyone&#x27;s attention!  Sounds like more all nighters to me!! 
I stayed up almost all night Monday so I could build yet another board, 
while I&#x27;m working I have these other ideas floating around in my head, 
waiting for a place to land. Like revisiting Spircom, and trying to apply 
what I know to it, thanks to Ryan! I think if I were to make a square wave 
audio generator, since a square wave contains all hamonics, randomly tune it 
to get that random function, then use that to modulate a simple transmtter, 
then receive that signal on a simple reciever a short distance away, maybe I 
can do something like Meek did. The transmitter/receiver can be made with 
mixer chips, like the SA602, and I have some in my junk box (a techy&#x27;s parts 
bins). Then the audio circuits are again just op amps, and I just got an 
order in.

  I&#x27;ve often wondered about the possiblity of modulating a White Noise 
signal, then listening for a response on a White Noise based receiver, using 
White Noise instead of a local oscillator, yeah, using normal voice to 
modulate the noise. You could use crystal filters to narrow the transmission 
to a small RF spectrum, something easy, like around 10mhz, but I&#x27;m not sure 
if ultra sound might not be better, since there&#x27;s  some that claim that&#x27;s 
where the spirits hang out. We need an Edison set up, a room full of 
researchers testing ideas.
