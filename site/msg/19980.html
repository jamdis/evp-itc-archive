the only thing it does...is show a lighted level display when there is soun=

level moves when your quite and you see the same level go up when no one is=
 speaking it suppose to inform you that you have a evp. I guess this is for=
 one the stop so to speak checking..not rocket science or anything it don't=
 suppose to make evp better or anything like that...it is what it is..
