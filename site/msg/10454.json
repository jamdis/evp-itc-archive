This one has a very usable AM/FM\n&gt; tuner that does use the analog tuning voltage, so I can use it in a\n&gt; box. All radio functions are in the module itself. This radio was\n&gt; unusual in that all the pins and connections were labeled. Usually I\n&gt; use a scope and voltmeter to id the pins of the module looking for\n&gt; operation voltages, which is usually 8 volts, mode pins, such as a pin\n&gt; that is for AM or FM, and goes to 8 volts, or sometimes 5 volts for the\n&gt; given band. I also look for any other enable voltages, inputs, and\n&gt; audio outputs, and the anttena pin(s). Junk yards usually want $10 each\n&gt; for junk radios, and many times they just are not usable. This one was\n&gt; $3!\n&gt;\n\nWow, what a find!\n\nWere these pins and connections labeled on the outside of the radio?  When \nI worked in an electronics repair shop, I recall some models of Sony and \nmaybe Pioneer had everything labeled inside the radio on the pc board.\n\n&gt; What I said about box concerns, maybe just suffice it to say, use at\n&gt; your own risk, there probably isn&#39;t any danger, and personally I\n&gt; haven&#39;t encountered anything I would relate directly to the box.\n&gt; However, that&#39;s not to say I haven&#39;t had encounters of an apparent\n&gt; demon kind. Just troublesom parasitic entities that once discovered\n&gt; quickly leave, not a big deal. I don&#39;[t want to get that serious wiht\n&gt; this. Now if everyone that uses the hack box goes bananas....\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;\n\nAnd maybe an occasional parasitic oscillation?\n:-)\n\nI still think the boxes are not causing any danger.\n\nZack"}
