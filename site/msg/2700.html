&gt; Dave ,
&gt; Once again I hear nothing but noise in these files. the hello file 
is 
&gt; not evp, it sounds like you paused the recording to answer the phone 
&gt; maybe and caught yourself saying hello.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m going to make my offer again. If you are new to this and want 
some 
&gt; help getting started please e-mail me and I will gladly explain how 
to 
&gt; get successful evp.

 Hello, first off you need to know that I am not new to evp&#x27;s. I have 
been low budget recording for at least 4 years and involved with the 
paranormal for over 30 years. I use a cheap olympus digital recorder 
and am very careful about the conditions i record. There was no &quot; pipe 
banging&quot; and I wasnt anywhere near a telephone All my evp&#x27;s are &quot; 
real&quot;. Just because you cant ( or wont) hear them doesnt mean that 
they are &quot;shuffling or natural noise&quot;. I can hear them and other 
people can hear them and that is enough for me. As i said i have been 
involved with the paranormal for many years and this has been a 
problem. If you cant hear what I hear or see what I see doesnt mean 
that im and idiot or faker.</pre>
