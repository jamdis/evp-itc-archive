<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This same thing could be said by EVP/ITC researchers about you Al.

At least the good people of this list and those around me can actually  
hear and see what I record and experience real paranormal phenomenon.  
Not always with a radio mind you. Not all of us use DRV for  
communication.

I&#x27;d call it ludicrous to take what a self proclaimed &quot;medium&quot; says,  
which on average and from years of research, has been found to be rare  
to have a high degree of any ability, over what a person can actually  
hear and see, but hey, that&#x27;s just from a silly scientific point of  
view.
