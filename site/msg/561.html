Took me forever to get the webcam running right again so the video 
wasnt choppy. I still have to get all my webcam software running correctly 
so for now I was just using quickcam and sports video player to view 
frame by frame.
   
  I asked them to help me test it and I had alot of fuzzy faces some of 
which I saved in paintbrush (as usual) but they lost some of thier 
color intensity. Not sure why yet. I still have to hammer that bug out. 
They seemed eager to test as well and eventually a few clearer faces 
started to come thru. It will take a while for me to stop messing with 
settings and to get back on track but eventually I will.
   
  Enjoy.
   
  I will add them to the gallery later when I get time.
   
  Misty
