That was it for that night. Other nights in the same house we recorded and =
heard plenty more. I heard a man's voice that said "he knows" oneearly morn=
ing. Our entire group heard a scared 7 year old little girl telling us she =
couldn't come down stairs because she wasn't allowed by another entity. We =
knew she was 7 because she told us. We also measured a 10 degree temperatur=
e drop with that one. We sat a small stuffed rabbit on the stairs to get he=
r to come down but she wouldn't because she was terrified.
