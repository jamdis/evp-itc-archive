The two I kicked off never accepted any\nevidence, ignored all examples of voices others posted, regardless of how\nclear they were. Claimed all they heard was gibbersih from the boxes, yet\npresented themselves as somehow more qualified to test the paranormal.\nAlways no data, no evidence, while ignoring everything presented.  They tend\nto imply all the EVP voices were the brain trying to make sense out of\nchaotic noise, nothing more. When questioned as to their motives they acuse\nme of attacking them.\n\n I&#39;ve been doing this stuff for ten years, and the two were pretty typical\nof most debunker/skeptics who deny deny deny, ignore ignore ignore and claim\na higher intellect. I reached my saturation point.\n\n They wanted to quote the statement on the group home page, which in fact\nstates I will kick off people that appear to be debunkers.\n\n Other methods are fine, not methods of debunking though! The box is one\nmethod of supplying the raw audio, just as white noise is a method of\nsupplying the raw audio. *My opinion* is that the spirits and entities\ncommunicate best if they have something to make their voices out of, and the\nbox, aka a swept radio, provides bits of speech music and noise for that\npurpose. I do not know anything about the so called paranormal, I don&#39;t do\n&quot;investigations&quot;, don&#39;t go to haunted areas to get EVPs. I do this stuff out\nof curiosity, and remain intrigued with these voices from a &quot;broken radio&quot;.\nIt really pisses me off to have someone who can&#39;t hear the stuff tell me\nwhat it really is.\n\n Frank-S\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nI'll epea i jus o be clea .
