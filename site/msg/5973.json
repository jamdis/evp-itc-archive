There is so\n&gt; &gt; much more than just listening to the files, you have too look. You\n&gt; &gt; have to train your eyes as well as your ears to make any sort of\n&gt; &gt; judgment. The second I load some of these files, before I listen, I\n&gt; &gt; see problems. I know the site isn&#39;t set up to really leave comments \n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; files with the file but something should be included in the name or\n&gt; &gt; something. Without it, it is not true representation of what the \n&gt; file\n&gt; &gt; is or what has happened between the capture and the post. We listen\n&gt; &gt; and think &quot;Wow! Great catch&quot; but we really do not know. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Are you starting the scan on your 3 469&#39;s at different frequencies?\n&gt; &gt; What is the ratio being mixed? Is it equal between the three? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I believe that Mark and Debbie Constantino (sp)of Nevada use water\n&gt; &gt; almost exclusively for their recordings. I have found that method to\n&gt; &gt; be difficult in hearing the results. Are you feeling that those\n&gt; &gt; communications are from spirits or earthbounds and what makes you \n&gt; feel\n&gt; &gt; that way?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve recently started analyzing a 40 min 469 session. The results \n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; scary. I&#39;d say at this point, and I&#39;m only 1/2 way through, 90% of \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; communication is negative in nature and mentions many supposed \n&gt; Demonic\n&gt; &gt; names. The layers of voices are, in many cases, multiple. Often, the\n&gt; &gt; listener hears very little of what is actually said. The voices can \n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; mocking or downright crude. I have not yet formed an opinion fully \n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; it would seem to me that these models are easy devices for lower \n&gt; level\n&gt; &gt; entities to figure out how to use. I can not speak of the attitudes \n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; fears of those investigators present although at times, their voices\n&gt; &gt; are a bit shaky. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Babs\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Ratka &lt;warrior18eii@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Very good observation Babs. Let me say that you have many friends\n&gt; &gt; and associates here just for the simple fact that you have an \n&gt; interest\n&gt; &gt; in ITC, are a researcher and a complex thinker. I think we have \n&gt; shown\n&gt; &gt; in the past that we can have a disagreement and still remain \n&gt; friends.\n&gt; &gt; You make a lot of good points in your post and I would like to know\n&gt; &gt; who removes time from their recordings. I have never removed time \n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; my recordings and see no reason why anyone else would without saying\n&gt; &gt; so in an accompanied post.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have limited experience with the 12-469&#39;s as a single piece of\n&gt; &gt; equipment. I have arranged mine per Mike&#39;s, &quot;Spiricomp&quot; design. I \n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; 3, 12-469&#39;s feeding a four channel mixer, which goes into a laptop\n&gt; &gt; running DC6 with Soundsoap 2. Mine scan equally spaced on the FM \n&gt; band.\n&gt; &gt; I have had pretty good results until recently.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; At first the messages were pretty clear but I had a feeling I was\n&gt; &gt; getting a different group than I normally have for the last few \n&gt; years.\n&gt; &gt; When I would ask about my friends on the other side they would tell \n&gt; me\n&gt; &gt; they will look for them. Well about 2 weeks ago the 12-469 \n&gt; arrangement\n&gt; &gt; started generating a lot of interference and feedback. I started\n&gt; &gt; hearing radio static voices as I use to get with shortwave. Not \n&gt; voice\n&gt; &gt; fragments but voices made of static (metallic and robotic). They \n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt; breaking through the sweeping. I had a feeling someone else was \n&gt; trying\n&gt; &gt; to force their way through. Finally the interference got so bad I \n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; forced to revert back to a simpler method I used before, which is\n&gt; &gt; using fan noise. One of the first messages to come across was from a\n&gt; &gt; familiar voice telling me and I quote, &quot;your method sucks&quot;. I have \n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; used the 12-469&#39;s since because of the clear messages I have been\n&gt; &gt; getting using water and fan noise. That does not mean I have given \n&gt; up\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  on the 12-469&#39;s but I won&#39;t use them again until I am persuaded \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; by my friends on the otherside that they are willing to use and \n&gt; adapt\n&gt; &gt; to it. To my knowledge only Misty, Laura and myself use water for\n&gt; &gt; recording.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank R.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: babiarz3 &lt;babiarz3@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, January 21, 2008 9:34:01 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Babs has Issues!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;     \n&gt; &gt; &gt;             Alright, you all know I&#39;m vocal and I haven&#39;t made any\n&gt; &gt; &quot;friends&quot; here\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but, if we can put that aside for a moment...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirit communication has been my passion since day one, a little \n&gt; over\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 6 years ago. I am a believer in the afterlife and a believer in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; spirits attempting to communicate with us for a variety of \n&gt; reasons. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have spiritual beliefs that I feel strongly about and devote much \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; my waking (and sleeping) moments to thoughts about this field.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I am also a researcher and a skeptic. In order for me to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; allow ideas to become part of my reality I must experiment. In \n&gt; order\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for me to believe something is paranormal I HAVE to rule out all \n&gt; other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible causes. That being said, I have some questions. My hope \n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that there are some here willing to enter into discussion with me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a difficult time with many of the files here. Many times, \n&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is no question included in the file. I can not determine whether \n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not the &quot;reply&quot; is an intelligent reply. Maybe this has to do with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; allowable file size.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some of the files I have been able to download. (I don&#39;t always \n&gt; keep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; my email settings on for this group as I get too many - lol) When \n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; look at the file I see problems. There will be complete flat line\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; silence between the words. Many times the &quot;reply&quot; is also at the \n&gt; same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; decibel as the question askers voice. Those two things should not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; occur naturally considering the devices being used. That tells me \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is manipulation of the files. Now, what is manipulation to \n&gt; me,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; may not be manipulation to others. To me, any altering of the \n&gt; recorded\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; file constitutes manipulation. I do not know if the reply was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligent or manipulated to be intelligent. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some say that they simply remove the &quot;no response&quot; time. I&#39;ve been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; told it can be as much as 18 seconds removed from between words. \n&gt; Now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; we run into the problem of us deciding what word fits in with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; question. What words are being ignored?  Did we take nonsense and \n&gt; make\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sense? Did we amp every noise/word or only what fit?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s great that files are offered for peer review. \n&gt; However, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; think we have to load them untouched or at the very least, offer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; exactly what was done to the entire file. Time elapsed between \n&gt; words,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; what was amped, etc. I&#39;d also love to see some of these sessions \n&gt; video\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; taped with the question asker facing the camera and a second hand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; clock visible. Truly, we aren&#39;t researching if we don&#39;t have some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; protocol in place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Here is an issue I have with the RS Hacks. I have the 469. It \n&gt; takes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; approximately 18 seconds to scan through the AM frequencies. Now, \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; typical person would think that we can take that 18 seconds and \n&gt; divide\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it by the number of AM stations to determine how long we are on \n&gt; each\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; station before moving on to the next one. In that way we could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; determine what is impossible to be said via a radio fragment. \n&gt; However,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that&#39;s not correct. The scan cycle can vary from one frequency to \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; next and of course the biggest problem is that some stations are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; picked up over multiple frequencies; AM 640 can be heard on 630, \n&gt; 640,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 650, 660 and maybe even 670. That extends the time a great deal. \n&gt; This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is a difficult problem because it is almost impossible for the \n&gt; average\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; person to be able to make a determination on time this way. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I heard about the following today; An experimenter records at the \n&gt; same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; time every day Mon-Fri. We hear about the importance of \n&gt; meditating,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; automatic writing, etc at the same time every day but what we \n&gt; have to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; remember with this, is that now we are in essence tuning into the \n&gt; same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; radio show every day. One of my first experiments with the 469 \n&gt; had me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hearing this deep male voice over and over again. What was he \n&gt; trying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to tell me, I wondered. Than I realized that he was speaking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; approximately every 18 seconds; every time the scan hit that \n&gt; station.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, if you are removing up to 18 seconds between words, then you \n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; really only recording the words from one station. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This post is IN NO WAY trying to start anything besides discussion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; about some research problems. I know that there are those who are \n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; concerned with anything more than the communication itself but I \n&gt; think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it is of the utmost importance to attempt to factor in some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; protocol in order for this to be considered serious research at \n&gt; all. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;
