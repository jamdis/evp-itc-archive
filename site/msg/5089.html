<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I never log anything! I used to keep track, but it seemed useless as 
far as proof went, and not too many were iterested. It would have 
been nice to have kept better notes about what I have done so far.

&gt; I have actually composed a log sheet for each testing session.  I 
believe Bruce is reviewing it to make sure I didn&#x27;t leave out any 
important information that we should also be logging.  Once I get the 
final ok, I will up load it and you can use it to recorded your data.
&gt;    
&gt;   Thanks!

&gt; 
&gt; Since we&#x27;re communicating with another dimension(s), then we should 
&gt; also note the time, weather, phases of the moon, any geomagnetic 
&gt; activity, solar flares, seismic activity, etc. in our area when 
&gt; conducting EVP sessions to see if we can determine when conditions 
&gt; are best for communicating.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, that&#x27;s quite a colorful set-up you have! It kinda looks like 
&gt; modern art. :)

&gt; &gt; Never fails, when I think I have something figured out, all I 
have 
&gt; to do is re-test, or change the set up slightly, and get totally 
&gt; different results. It seemed for a while that the sound 
chamber/echo 
&gt; box was not needed, but last night&#x27;s voices were so much better--
and 
&gt; longer, with that larger box with the crystal ball on top. I think 
it 
&gt; just depends on those undefinable conditions that govern 
commnication 
&gt; for the other side, we have to be able to change our setup as 
needed, 
&gt; or as intuition dictates. I didn&#x27;t have time to copy the voices tot 
&gt; he computer, as I&#x27;m back on a regualr sched now.
