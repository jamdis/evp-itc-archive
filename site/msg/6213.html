<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>hey,

I did a MB session today and asked for Ms. Estep.
Mike and lisa were kind enough to bring her forward and help with the 
communication. I believe she is still adjusting to being on the other 
side and has not fully grasped how to send communication from the other 
side, with an array of different boxes to work with.

I asked about the prior message concerning her whistle statement, the 
answer I recieved was &quot;they whistled often&quot; I&#x27;m assuming she meant her 
spirit contacts.

The files are posted in a sub folder marked MB_files in my main folder
Bruces box files. In the future all sub folders for different box files 
will be in this sub folder.

thanks guy&#x27;s
