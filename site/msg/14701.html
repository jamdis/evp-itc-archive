Yes, you need speical permission. I was there for an all night ghost hunt a=
s a guest of Eastern Paranormal. The place can be rented at night but belie=
ve me when i say "it ain't cheap". Plus I don't think the prison would appr=
eciate me=A0releaseing the inmates=A0before their eternal sentence has been=
 served.
