That&#39;s pure, unadulterated Fantasy.\n  The Ghosts do not have the where-with-all to accomplish this in the first place, and even if they did they don&#39;t give a rats&#39; rear end what a Ghost Hunter does or doesn&#39;t do.  That boy really needs to get real.  Ghosts simply do not re-act to the living in that way, or much of any other way except to allow us to see or hear them and then only when they want it to happen.  Their most obvious and biggest trait is to be totally indifferent to our wishes.   Over 40 yrs. of Investigating the Paranormal has taught me nothing if it hasn&#39;t taught me this.      --Rod\n   \n   \n   velazquez &lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt; wrote:\n          Here, here Bruce.
