<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Steve,

Margret&#x27;s EVPmaker settings are listed below (scroll down).

Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have any samples of similar phoneme sets; however, I haven&#x27;t yet been looking for it. What I&#x27;d be interested in are German allophones of that kind, in order to get EVP also in my language. (With the SJ file, I get only English EVPs.)

Commercial text-to-speech applications usually aren&#x27;t &quot;low-level&quot; enough to have access to the speech elements, but perhaps research sites or university web sites are a resource for such samples?

BTW, there&#x27;s a program called TalkAny from Microsoft; you can type in any text and it will speak it immediately. It has many options to alter the voice, and there&#x27;s also a preset called &#x27;Little Robot&#x27; which makes the voice sound very similar to the SpeakJet chip. I use it sometimes to counter-check / verify &quot;EVPmaker + SpeakJet&quot; EVPs.

Perhaps it can be used to generate an own set of phonemes / allophones.

I could upload this program, if desired.

Stefan

Stefan,

I like the use of the SJ Allophones with the EVP maker. I did send Margaret an email asking how she sets up but have yet to hear back. I have been looking around for phoneme and formant samples of the same caliber but have come up short. Do you have any such samples?

Best Regards,

Frank R.

                Hi all,

although it is possible to use &quot;Zero Cross&quot; and &quot;Use Cue List&quot; at the
same time, it is unnecessary, since I had already zero-crossed the cue
ranges in Audition.

(Just a hint...)

But please, I don&#x27;t wanna keep anyone from playing and experimenting.
Not seldom users discover potentialities of an application even the
developer never knew of... :)

&gt; Hi Rees.  Try these settings with the Speak Jet Allophones file and ask for Arthur. :0)

&gt; Segments: USE CUE LIST / Z-CROSS (both check marked)
&gt; Play EVP: CONTINUOUSLY
&gt; Speed Control: 106%

&gt; It takes some practice getting used to picking out the words, but since you are already 
&gt; experienced with radio sweep, I&#x27;m thinking you&#x27;ll get the hang of it right away.
