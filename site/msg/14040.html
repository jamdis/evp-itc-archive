<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I hope you&#x27;ll give manual sweep a try.  As I&#x27;ve mentioned in other posts, I have a number of the automated sweep devices, and the manual sweep results can give any of them a run for their money.  You can try just about any radio that has a tight enough dial to rapidly move back and forth across the band.  

There is also one known unit out there (probably more yet undiscovered) that all you have to do is hold down the tuner button (and keep holding) and it sweeps automatically without being hacked.  See if you can pick up a Sony #SRF-M37V.  I know other researchers who&#x27;ve gotten good results with that.  Just add batteries and you&#x27;re good to go.  Oh, and an external speaker too.

&gt; If someone out there could/would make me a  radio or box that doesn&#x27;t tick, 
&gt; and has a fast speed, I would pay them up front  for it and the work they 
&gt; do, I am not sure with ebay, because I want to know  that I am getting the 
&gt; right kind.  Thank you, SF
&gt; p.s. let me know, I will be more than glad to  pay for it up front with a 
&gt; good electronic&#x27;s  person.
