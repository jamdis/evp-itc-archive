<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Whatever you do, do not do your own EVP recordings! There is only one
possible outcome of the test, and that&#x27;s &quot;see, we told everyone, nothing to
it&quot;. I think the otherside is not interested in performing for skeptics that
would not accept it anyway.

 and don&#x27;t even ask, I don&#x27;t play those games either. There is far more than
enough to prove to any thinking person this stuff is real.

&gt;  Since we&#x27;re talking about experiments and protocols here are some ideas
&gt; to improve
&gt; the protocol RJ suggested initially. Using a test target is one way of
&gt; establishing a
&gt; truth in time, which is the basis of this experiment. But there are a
&gt; couple of issues.
&gt;
&gt; It is quite possible that someone could discern the target through remote
&gt; viewing alone.
&gt; This would negate the need for involvement of a spirit communicator or
&gt; discarnate entity.
&gt; Outcomes depend on the word of those reporting. The true skeptic (not
&gt; cynic) would
&gt; therefore say that this experiment contains a basic flaw in that it does
&gt; not uniquely
&gt; indicate that the information was obtained in the prescribed manner.
&gt; Providing access
&gt; to the raw audio file would not necessarily constitute proof either, since
&gt; many of these
&gt; communications can only be heard by certain people,
&gt;
&gt; If the audio file were quite clear, timing  becomes an issue. In other
&gt; words, when was
&gt; the audio actually recorded?  This issue can be mitigated simply by
&gt; requiring any
&gt; claimant to email the audio file to a trusted party before the test ends.
&gt; It would be best
&gt; if the trusted party were not otherwise invovled in the experiment and it
&gt; was  their duty
&gt; simply to collect the claims. Once all claims had been collected they could
&gt; be posted
&gt; publicly for review by the community in general.  The experimenter could
&gt; decide if any
&gt; of the claims seemed to have hit, and this decision could be reviewed by
&gt; anyone if desired.
&gt;
&gt; The important detail however is that this experiment does not completely
&gt; answer the
&gt; question. It is a first attempt and certainly can be improved on successive
&gt; trials.
&gt;
&gt; Successive trials are always a good idea, since it provides replication.
&gt; And it would be
&gt; best if others replicated the experiment using a very similar protocol. If
&gt; these were to
&gt; succeed, the community could then state that out of X trials Y had
&gt; succeeded (by
&gt; some definition of success) potentially giving a success rate above that
&gt; expected
&gt; by random chance. This would make the outcome quantifiable and measureable
&gt; and thus meaningful.
&gt;
&gt; But also important to note, this would only prove the potential veracity of
&gt; the messages.
&gt; It would not (and cannot as far as I can tell) prove the origin of the
&gt; messages. This detail
&gt; will, I fear, remain a matter for belief and speculation for quite some
&gt; time to come.
&gt;
&gt;

Wha e e you do, do no do you own EVP eco dings! The e is only one possible ou come o he es , and ha &#x27;s &quot;see, we old e e yone, no hing o i &quot;. I hink he o he side is no in e es ed in pe o ming o skep ics ha would no accep i anyway.

Since we&#x27; e alking abou expe imen s and p o ocols he e a e some ideas o imp o e

This would nega e he need o in ol emen o a spi i communica o o disca na e en i y.
Ou comes depend on he wo d o hose epo ing. The ue skep ic (no cynic) would

I he audio ile we e qui e clea , iming  becomes an issue. In o he wo ds, when was 
 he audio ac ually eco ded?  This issue can be mi iga ed simply by equi ing any

The impo an de ail howe e is ha his expe imen does no comple ely answe he

Successi e ials a e always a good idea, since i p o ides eplica ion. And i would be
