          Hello, Ben. I lived in Melbourne (specifically Palm Bay) for 3 
years...1980 to 1983. Watched some of the first shuttle launches from 
the back door of my apartment. [saw the first night launch off one of 
the Cape's causeways] I was back there for a few days last year for 
business (I used to work for Harris and I was a temporary liason for 
Boeing for a piece of equipment that Harris was building for the C-130 
modernization program).

Have you ever investigated that allegedly haunted restaurant up in 
Cocoa Beach that the late author Martin Caidin used to check out? I 
don't remember the name right off the top of my head but his friend - 
parapsychologist Loyd Auerbach - wrote about it in one of his books. 
I'll look it up for you.

Please keep in touch as you might be able to assist me in verifying a 
moderern day ghost story concerning the late Mercury astronaut Deke 
Slayton.
