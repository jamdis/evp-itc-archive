Hey Mike
   
  I had a good, quiet Easter with just me and my son...he is 13 so we didnt do the easter egg hunt or basket...and didnt do anything fancy for dinner....just stuffed bell peppers and I made him some deviled eggs earlier in the day too.  Hope yours was a good one.
   
  I just did my first session with the RS 12-470 yesterday. Before I turned the radio on....I started talking to the spirits that might be around..."Hey everybody, just wanted to let you know Im gonna do a session with this new 470 box in about 10 mins....now Im new to it so dont get frustrated if I dont hear you clearly"  
   
  Then right before I turned the 470 on I just started out imaging a white light surrounding me and protecting me from any negative energies or spirts out there. And I asked outloud for God to keep me safe and asked the spirits to please keep any negative spirits or energy away and to keep my house safe.  Then I said "OK I'm gonna turn on the box now and let it warm up a bit so you can get used to it"  Turned it on(and my recorder...which Im using my pc right now for that) and let it run for a couple mins, just so they could get used to how it works...I figured since I was new to this then they probably were too. 
   
  I also figured it couldnt hurt to talk to them beforehand...so they get to know my personality a bit.  Then I gave an invite for positive spirits to come forward and feel free to check out and try the box and send any messages thru they had....Then I  just introduced myself..."Hi everybody my name is Rhonda"(waited and listened for a bit)...."Is there anyone here who would like to say hello?" (waited for a lil bit and got a couple of Yes's and a No lol).  Just talked to them like they were sitting right here in my living room and we have known each other....joked around a bit..."Come on you know you wanna say hi"  
   
  I tried to get them to say my name but that didnt happen...but if I turned it on and heard "Hi Rhonda!" I would prolly pick my jaw up off the floor and say HI!!!.  Also I felt it was polite to say thank you whenever they answered me...kind of a treat them how you would like to be treated(I do that in my normal everyday life anyways so its easy to be polite).
   
  Just kept any questions short and to the point...and my point was a short get to know each other session...which Im gonna do a few more of...dont wanna overwhelm them or me(lol).
   
  I found too that I got the best results using the AM band...but I did a short stint in both bands to try it out. When I went to switch bands I asked them "do you find that the AM band was working best for us?  Heard a clear "Yes"  so I said "Ok...thank you...so Im gonna change it back to AM, is that ok with you?" Heard an "Ok"
   
  I actually heard Frank mentioned but it was in my first part of my session when I had the box too far from the mic and the mic not on loud enuff to pick up either the box or me. So it wasnt recorded.
   
  Im also an avid CBer by the way...and ya its kinda like that...driving around gettin to know people, asking names(handles in CB lingo), if anyone is out there, and just shootin the breeze like you would do if you were talkin to ur CB friends....and just letting them get to know you and vice versa.  I honestly wasnt expecting to get much of anything...but was happy as a pig in poo with what I got.  
   
  So basically my whole goal or plan is just to make friends with them and give them a chance and oppritunity to pass on their messages be it to me or others(which I could pass on to them).  
   
  I had come here with hopes that Id be able to contact my mom, who passed away Feb 21st of this year...but I know that when I was doing EVP you dont always get in contact with who you are trying to and I started thinking...that maybe our loved ones have moved on to a different part of heaven...or maybe there is some kind of "probation" time for them before they can get out there and use the boxes and radios and do EVPs....not in a bad probation sort of way, more of a get used to not being on earth and being in heaven kind of way.
   
  Everyone who has done this on here has said dont go into a session if you are frustrated or angry, upset, irritated or even overly tired...cuz that can attract negative energy to you....like a big flash light in the dark saying come on over Im wide open...and thats not a good thing.  If you find yourself getting frustrated or upset during a session I would think it would be better to finish up your session. 

  Gotta remember, that its not easy for them to use energy and those fragments of speech going by so quickly...it takes them time to get used to it just as it takes us time to get used to listening and getting our "ears". Practice makes perfect...but its sometimes not gonna be perfect and you cant let that frustrate you.  Most of the others on here have been doing this for a long time and have a strong friendship with their techs/guides.
   
  I think Id also compare it to meeting someone in person for the first time...for me, Im a shy person, very shy at times...until I get to know someone then ya cant get me to shut up!  But it takes time to form that friendship and get them to open up...and takes time to get our "ears".
   
  Anyways I have prolly rambled on way too long for you....but wanted to give you my input...and like I said im new to the ghost box type communication but have done conventional EVPs for a while now.  Hopefully I havent steered you wrong and Im sure if I have someone will correct me =)
   
  Also before you shut off your box you ask everyone who came across to please go back to their side, give them a minute to do that and then ask them if its ok to shut the door(shut your radio off)...when you get a conformation(I heard a loud and clear "Do It"...then you thank them and say bye and shut er down.  That way you dont take the chance of leaving anyone behind in your house.
   
  Hope my ramblings helped ya a bit.
   
  Rhonda

            Hi all, and hope you all had a good Easter!
   
  I keep listening to everyone's recordings and since they are clips of what you are doing, my question is how do each of you start a recording to even get these responses?
   
  I write procedures and education instruction, and I am missing this piece.
   
  So you pull out the radio
  You plug in the external speaker
  You turn the radio on
  Then set the recorder to record
  But how do you start the recording?
   
  I mean, do you start off by saying, "hi everyone this is Bruce, or Kristn or Rhonda. Is anyone one there?"  Or do you start calling out names, or do you even pray the night before that you plan to turn the radio on at 9am on such and such a date, or is it when you turn it on they are waiting for you?
   
  Also lets say you turn the radio on, and a spirit says hi Rhonda!. From there what is your response? What types of questions do you ask? 
   
  Is it more like a phone call to a family member, friend, or even just talking on a CB radio to truckers passing by trying to learn who they are etc.....
   
  I am trying to step out a method for myself and it is frustrating me that I dont have a plan when I turn that rradio and recorder on.
   
  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!
