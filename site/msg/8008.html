I heard their was a new way to hack the 20-125.  Its not very different from your hack.  I heard somewhere that you take a eye glass(little) screwdriver and poke it through the hole that the MU is next too.  My techs don't like the 125, and I'm pretty sure that I didn't cut the wire next to the MU, but its possible that I might have trying to get some of the glue off the wire harness.   On a later date I might give it another try, but right now I'm going to stick with what my techs like, and I get good results.  If might be good to go ahead and purchase the 125 before the stop selling those, just like the old 470's

I would assume that any other wire cut would affect some performance of the radio.
And you know as luck would have it it probably was the wire connecting the antenna.
 
I have amazing communication with the 125 and have had positive feedback from
everyone else that has used it.
 
So I would say yes if you accidentally cut another wire it probably had to do with reception.
If you have the means, I would give the 125 another shot.

  I had the 20-125, and hack it with the instruction that you gave me.  I didn't get any results with that box as I told you before in the other group.  Of course I took it back and I stuck with my 469, because my tech didn't like the radio either.  My question is if I accidentally cut the wire left of the MU wire would that affect the reception with the radio?

Hey guy's,

Here are a few from a session with the 125 a couple of day's ago.

For the new people that may be working with the RS 12-469 and would 
like to have a box without the clicking on AM and also an internal 
speaker and telescope antenna.

You should give this 20-125 a shot! I have gotten some of my best 
communication using this little dynamo. and it's very affordable and 
simple to hack.

If anyone has any questions please feel free.

Bruce
