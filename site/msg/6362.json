Wow.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce, I think you&#39;ll be pleased to know that I lit my Buddhist  \n&gt; altar and did a protection prayer first. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; And I put a quartz crystal on top of the box to boot.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hedging all my bets today!\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann\n&gt;\n&gt; On Jan 26, 2008, at 7:38 PM, bruce halliday wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann,\n&gt;\n&gt; Another good one, what box?\n&gt; Let me guess the MB?\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sat, 26 Jan 2008 19:16:08 +0000\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC\n&gt; group.\n&gt;\n&gt; File : /Ann&#39;s files/comehelpme012608.mp3\n&gt; Uploaded by : lisbyfarrum &lt;lisby@...&gt;\n&gt; Description : &quot;Come and help me.&quot; I say, &quot;Can you hear me?&quot;  \n&gt; &quot;Voices.&quot; &quot;Excellent!&quot; &quot;Speaking.&quot; Normal speed, then slowed by 25  \n&gt; and 50 percent.\n&gt;\n&gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Ann%27s%20files/ \n&gt; comehelpme012608.mp3\n&gt;\n&gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/ \n&gt; index.htmlfiles\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; lisbyfarrum &lt;lisby@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Connect and share in new ways with Windows Live.
