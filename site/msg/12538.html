<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>appreciate your hard work with this one. From an aesthetic standpoint,
I love the new 470 and it would be great to have a cheap am sweeper
without that annoying chuffing sound on am sweep.

thanks again Mike, you rock
Andy

&gt; Close, but no audio.
&gt; 
&gt; I did get the radio to sweep the bands without stopping yesterday, but
&gt; there was no audio. Now if I can only duplicate that again... this time
&gt; with audio.
&gt; 
&gt; I was able to get the wire bundle connecting the two ends of the circuit
&gt; board connector done this morning. And the radio still works just like
&gt; when it was still all together.
&gt; 
&gt; What I&#x27;ve done is add a series of wires so I can access the underside of
&gt; the circuit board containing the two ICs I want to manipulate. This wire
&gt; bundle is soldered to on connector and plugged into the other. It allows
&gt; the radios circuit boards to remain electrically connected.
&gt; 
&gt; I took a video to show it still functions like right-out-of-the-box...
&gt; but for how long...??
&gt; 
&gt; Working with no schematic is really a challenge...  I&#x27;m afraid I may fry
&gt; the radio with one wrong probe.
&gt; 
&gt; There&#x27;s a few pics of the wire bundle and circuit boards on my blog, at:
