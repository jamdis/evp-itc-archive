<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

just received the latest AA-EVP NewsJournal. Especially the radio sweep
method and EVPmaker are discussed quite controversially in this issue.
Alec MacRae for instance wrote:

Like EVPmaker, the swept receiver method is capable of producing EVP,
but it is also even more capable of producing false results. Some years
ago, I did a series of experiments with EVPmaker.... What EVPmaker does
is take a few seconds of speech, chop it into little pieces called
phonemes and then randomize these phonemes. If you are lucky, you will
find EVP.

What some people do, frustrated at not getting very much, is they make
the slices wider, so then what you are getting are actually sizeable
little chunks of the sentence. Actual words are still there. In that
case you seem to be getting more EVP, but what you are getting is simply
a rearranged sentence.

My comment on this:

If only phonemes are used, as is the case for the SpeakJet allophones
file, this won&#x27;t happen, since this source material definitely doesn&#x27;t
already contain speech. In order to rule out doubts as to getting &quot;false
EVPs&quot;, only audio sources should be used in the future which aren&#x27;t
already finished speech. So perhaps using SJ allophones are one step
towards the right direction. Interesting, that this comes up right now...
