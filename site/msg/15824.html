Oh-to answer your first question-Solid proof for me would be an intelligent=
, back and forth conversation. It would also have to be VERY clear and many=
 people would have to say they hear the same thing.

    So what constitutes proof? All I know for certain is that some=
thing talks by using the bits of audio from radio stations as the tunign is=
 swept. However, it can not be proven what it is that's talking, so I guess=
 that makes the whole thing invalid of little use.
