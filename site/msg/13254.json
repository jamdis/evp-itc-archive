Go for it.\n\nAnd Ron already knows me well. I am a little beyond caring how or why it works, or even asking spirits questions. I just record thier chatter, document for my own learning, and share with a few friends or persons its meant for privately. Once in a while I post samples for others who are curious about the different methods being used or new to the subject. \n\nI never expect anyone to hear anything as I do, its a nice surprise when someone does =)\n\nGood luck!\n\nMisty\n \n\n\n\n\n\n--- On Wed, 1/14/09, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] New Water EVP\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, January 14, 2009, 12:04 PM\n&gt; Hello RJ  You make good points here.  I had to re look at\n&gt; the purpose of the group to see if this was a scientific\n&gt; research group or other.  It looks like it is in the\n&gt; &quot;or other&quot; category.  I do believe there are\n&gt; strictly research groups around that can apply the rules of\n&gt; scientific testing.  More in the hobbyist or enthusiast\n&gt; mode?\n&gt;  \n&gt; One  of the reasons I joined this group is because I\n&gt; appreciate members like Misty for posting their work and\n&gt; not having to do so under some scientific\n&gt; methodology.  That, I think, would hinder innovation,\n&gt; testing, sharing and even enjoyment of what we do here. \n&gt; And, again, it is not the stated purpose of this\n&gt; group.  Doubters and debunkers certainly have a place in\n&gt; this non-scientific arena, but here I hope to see posts from\n&gt; people who are not afraid to try a technique and then share\n&gt; it with others.  I was looking for your posts with the\n&gt; group here...do you have any?  I do not mean that as a\n&gt; challenge...I am sincerely interested in hearing your\n&gt; clips.   best wishes   ron l  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;                                                   Reality\n&gt; Is Your Idea\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 1/14/09, Rj &lt;rasterer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Rj &lt;rasterer@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] New Water EVP\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, January 14, 2009, 8:15 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I know what you mean Misty - it does seem that\n&gt; interpretations are often varied.  I am thinking that the\n&gt; best way to make progress is to get an audio sample that you\n&gt; think is most representative of a given approach&#39;s\n&gt; effectiveness, and send that privately to several people. \n&gt; Name the file something innocuous (like File1) and\n&gt; don&#39;;t tell the people you send it to what you think you\n&gt; hear.  Also, ask the people not to discuss the file with\n&gt; anyone else, and have them send what they think they hear\n&gt; directly back to you,rather than posting the results in a\n&gt; forum or group.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that kind of test is helpful, since it seems to me\n&gt; that once someone tells me what the audio clip sounds like,\n&gt; then it&#39;s hard for me to hear anything else in it. \n&gt; But,that could be influencing my interpretation (like\n&gt; someone pointing to a cloud, telling me its a horse, and\n&gt; then I have trouble NOT seeing a horse) ,so it&#39;s better\n&gt; to listen before it is suggested to me what i should be\n&gt; hearing.\n&gt; \n&gt; This way, I think the most progress can be made, because if\n&gt; people just keep confirming what we think we hear, and it\n&gt; turns out it&#39;s just noise that we are forcing an\n&gt; interpretation into, we won&#39;t be making progress (though\n&gt; it might make us feel good to believe that we&#39;re being\n&gt; successful).  Getting negative feedback to one&#39;s\n&gt; approach is not as fun, and might feel like some\n&gt; non-believer is trying to debunk us.  But, really, that can\n&gt; be the best feedback for progress, since it helps us to\n&gt; change tactics when our current approach is not effective,\n&gt; rather than continuing down an ineffective path, getting\n&gt; accolades from friends, but missing out on other paths that\n&gt; might show more promise,.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 1/13/09, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@\n&gt; yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] New Water EVP\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, January 13, 2009, 7:37 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks RJ\n&gt; \n&gt; I never know who will hear what. No matter which method is\n&gt; used. Everyone hears differently, different speaker setups,\n&gt; different software. I just post a variety of whats clear to\n&gt; me using different methods.
