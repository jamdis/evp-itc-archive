<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ann,

I went to radio shack and bought a speaker model #21-549 and it seems 
to work fine.  I got mine yesterday and didn&#x27;t seem to thrilled about 
the results and gave another try tonight.  Tonight, i spoke to several 
different people in their own voices and really have to give credit to 
Mike and Lisa for making this communication keep getting better.  This 
really is another valuable box in my research, as long as different 
designs become available i will test them all.  Every box is unique 
and offers different results, but they all work off the same premise 
of raw audio bits.  Real time communication is finally here and gets 
better every day, some day&#x27;s frank&#x27;s box is better and than some day&#x27;s 
RS box...etc.  Depends on your surroundings, your mood, the weather 
but all these devices have worked for me up to this point and i&#x27;m 
grateful.

p.s.--here is the link to the speaker so you can get a visual.

Your going to love this wild ride and watching new people get involved 
and posted results makes it all worth it for me.

&gt; 
&gt; Hey, fellow list dwellers who have one--what extra equipment to I  
&gt; need to have to make this function (speakers, but not computer  
&gt; speakers)? Anything else I can go out an get now? I am truly, truly  
&gt; technology challenged, so guidance addressed to one like a toddler 
is  
&gt; what I need.
