<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>There is a phenomena known as stochastic resonance that states a weak
signal can &quot;piggy back&quot; on a stronger carrier signal and then detected
by us. In other words, we can hear audible noise and our brains and
devices can detect and record the embedded messages that would
otherwise be undetectable.  -Bill

&gt; Regarding the &quot;noisy&quot; box, why do EVPs seem to come through during 
&gt; people talking?  I have noticed that I find more EVPs if I or another 
&gt; is talking, and then the voice seems to appear between and/or with 
&gt; the audio voices.  Carrier, perhaps?

&gt; &gt; Hey mister this is the kind of post I like! I&#x27;ve been apprehensive
&gt; &gt; about blogging here because if you don&#x27;t regularly upload your audio
&gt; &gt; files it results in being ostracized by a lot of participants here.
&gt; &gt; And the fighting amongst some people is discouraging also. But I
&gt; &gt; prefer video as you and some others know. So I quietly videotape
&gt; &gt; sessions and share them with other researchers who aren&#x27;t anxious to
&gt; &gt; pounce on anyone based on opinion or frequency of posting here.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Suffice to say virtually every method of ITC is employed by me, and
&gt; &gt; call me obsolete if you want to but I still mainly use RVG maybe
&gt; &gt; because it&#x27;s what I have to work with even though most others 
&gt; embrace
&gt; &gt; sweep. I&#x27;ve got Hacked Shack and other commercial Boxes, but always
&gt; &gt; end up going to an early style Box with RVG only. It&#x27;s noisy, and
&gt; &gt; single mode, but it&#x27;s what I use most often anyway because of the 
&gt; results.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all; There are alternatives;  1-EVPmaker, a free program that
&gt; &gt; runs on a PC and performs the same function as the box, that is it
&gt; &gt; provides the raw audio spirits/entities use to form voices. It is in
&gt; &gt; fact the inspiration for my boxes.  2-The Mini box by
&gt; &gt; paranormalsystems.com. It&#x27;s a direct output, linear sweep system 
&gt; based
&gt; &gt; on my boxes, and it does work.  3-Use the manual sweep mathod, take 
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; radio that can be tuned easily by hand, tune the dial up and down
&gt; &gt; slowly while recording directly from the speaker. Always announce 
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; are doing an EVP session before you start recording. Manual sweep 
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; the basis for linear sweep that the Mini box uses, and that I have
&gt; &gt; adopted for my boxes, and was first developed here on this group.  
&gt; 3-
&gt; &gt; Foreign language-Tune in a short wave broadcast in a language you
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t understand, and record directly from the speaker of the radio.
&gt; &gt; You can also use an internet foreign language boroadcast for the 
&gt; same
&gt; &gt; purpose. See coffeepotghost.com for more information.  4-Radio 
&gt; between
&gt; &gt; stations as a source of white noise. I like to pick a night when 
&gt; there
&gt; &gt; lots of skip, stations fadding in and oput randomly, this is a great
&gt; &gt; source of raw audio. You&#x27;ll have ignore the critics that cliam 
&gt; you&#x27;re
&gt; &gt; only hearing broadcast fragments, you hav eto judge the result by
&gt; &gt; meaning, that is, does the message mean anything personally?   I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; sure there&#x27;s other methods out on the web. I suggest peole start 
&gt; wiht
&gt; &gt; white noise, and work your way up. 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt;  There is nothing magical about the boxes, it&#x27;s a swept radio,
&gt; &gt; nothing more. It provides a higher level--louder--audio that spirits
&gt; &gt; use to make voices, that is all it does!   I usually do not ask
&gt; &gt; questions when I do sessions, I think that biases the mind into
&gt; &gt; expecting, and maybe even creating the answers one wants the hear. I
&gt; &gt; rely on the guides to give me what I need. I also don&#x27;t do
&gt; &gt; &quot;investigations&quot;, again I think it biases your mind into creating 
&gt; what
&gt; &gt; you want. I really doubt there is any haunting if no one is there to
&gt; &gt; experience it.   I know---what I say is to be dismissed as it 
&gt; doesn&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; jive with the Hollywood version of the paranormal.      Frank-S
