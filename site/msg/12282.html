<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Leah.  Some months ago, Stefan created an allophones files (I think it&#x27;s 72 speech 
fragments based on the Speak Jet chip) to use in conjunction with his EVP Maker program.  
Because the allophones file contains only fragments and not complete words or sentences 
(though to be sure, some fragments can sound like words, ie:  &quot;I&quot; &quot;ear/hear&quot; etc) there isn&#x27;t 
an easy explanation for the responses which are produced by it ... responses that are not 
only complete sentences, but relevant to the topic of the session.

I think using the allophones file goes a long way in helping to rule out false positives.  I 
have actually had multiple sessions where real-time communication has taken place back 
and forth between myself and the person in spirit communicating via this set-up.  :-)

&gt; Are you talking about the computer program EVP Maker from Germany?  All it does is 
jumble whatever come through the mike, there is no way to be sure you actually get 
anything.  Unless you know something that I don&#x27;t about it.
&gt; 
&gt; Take care,

&gt; &gt; Has anyone tried the program EVP Maker ?
&gt; &gt; http://www.stefanbi on.de/evpmaker/ index_e.htm
&gt; &gt; I was thinking about using it with my other equipment for a
&gt; &gt; continuing 
&gt; &gt; investigation of an old house.
