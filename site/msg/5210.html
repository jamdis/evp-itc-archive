&gt; &gt; Today I attended the funeral and burial of a great lady: Sarah 
Estep,
&gt; &gt; the founder of the American Association of Electronic Voice 
Phenomena.
&gt; &gt; Sarah died on January 3, of kidney failure, following a two-week
&gt; &gt; illness. She was 81.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Everyone who has ever done EVP for investigations, research or
&gt; &gt; personal study owes Sarah a huge debt. She has left behind a
&gt; &gt; phenomenal legacy: the AA-EVP, an international research 
organization
&gt; &gt; she established in 1982; a classification of voices; a library of
&gt; &gt; thousands of recordings she herself made over the years; and
&gt; &gt; inspiration and passion that have fueled countless researchers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I became friends with Sarah several years ago, when I lived a few
&gt; &gt; miles from her home in Annapolis, Maryland. She was warm, witty 
and
&gt; &gt; wonderful company, and she generously let me listen to many of 
her EVP
&gt; &gt; recordings, and even experiment with her original reel-to-reel 
setup.
&gt; &gt; She possessed a great store of knowledge, and a zest for
&gt; &gt; investigating the unknown, especially the afterlife and survival.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Things come full circle in remarkable ways. The casket that now
&gt; &gt; serves as the final resting place of Sarah&#x27;s physical form was 
also
&gt; &gt; the beginning of her remarkable study of the afterlife. As a 
child,
&gt; &gt; she once sneaked peeks into caskets at the funeral parlor owned 
by her
&gt; &gt; grandparents in Altoona, Pennsylvania. It seemed obvious to her 
that
&gt; &gt; death was an end, final.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Later in life, she undertook EVP experiments to prove to herself 
that
&gt; &gt; there is no survival after death. Night after night she recorded
&gt; &gt; without results. Just as she was about to give up, she recorded a
&gt; &gt; clear female voice that said, &quot;Our world is one of beauty.&quot; She 
was a
&gt; &gt; believer.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; One of her most remarkable EVPs was, &quot;Death no more a casket.&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sarah is now on the Other Side, discovering wonders that we here 
on
&gt; &gt; this side only glimpse. Undoubtedly we will hear much from her 
&gt; &gt; she&#x27;s quite determined when she sets her mind to a task.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The service for Sarah was lovely, and daughter Becky gave a moving
&gt; &gt; eulogy. Three white doves were released at graveside in Annapolis.
&gt; &gt; Among those attending were Tom and Lisa Butler, who have led the 
AAEVP
&gt; &gt; at its Reno headquarters since 2000, and Richard Shenk, a longtime
&gt; &gt; AA-EVP member and researcher from Delaware.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sarah&#x27;s last public appearance was in 2006, at the AA-EVP 
conference
&gt; &gt; in Atlanta. She delivered a marvelous speech on her career in EVP,
&gt; &gt; and was recognized with a lifetime achievement award.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The AA-EVP is establishing a memorial fund in Sarah&#x27;s name to help
&gt; &gt; continue research. Contributions may be made to the AAEVP, PO Box
&gt; &gt; 1311, Reno, NV 89507.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My article on Sarah, her life and research (FATE Magazine, 
December
&gt; &gt; 2004), is posted on my website at
