I, too, heard Bedford. I didn&#x27;t hear the first part of that file but that doesn&#x27;t mean it wasn&#x27;t there.

&gt;  Well, he says, &quot;south bedford, UK to me, maybe it&#x27;s the difference in which program we listen to them on each time?  I did find a South Bedford, and they are having really bad weather right now, don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on in Africa right now. sf

&gt;                                              Oh brother...are you kidding us, Snow?
&gt;   
&gt;  For what it&#x27;s worth, the file in question is unmistakable to my ears and DEFINITELY says &quot;South Africa.&quot; 
&gt;   
&gt;  Why can&#x27;t some people hear these things? I understand now why Frank gets so frustrated at times, especially when people tell him (or Steve or anyone, really!) what their files &quot;really&quot; say. 
&gt;   
&gt;  Further, I don&#x27;t think people here share their files so that others can (mis) &quot;interpret&quot; their recordings for them! 
&gt;   
&gt;  I&#x27;ve seen this happen over and over and over again (usually by the same people) and personally I feel that it&#x27;s incredibly rude, condescending and totally obnoxious. 
&gt;   
&gt;  My two cents, 
&gt;  J

&gt;      
&gt; Thank you for correcting me, hopefully one day i will have a better ear to hear the communication like you do. 
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe Frank and I should give up. He has about 8 years listening to box communication and i have about 5, but the newer people are empatically telling us what our files really say.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe Frank and I are losing our ear for this.

&gt; &gt; He didn&#x27;t say Africa, it sounds like he said, &quot;south bedford&quot; where ever that is. sf
