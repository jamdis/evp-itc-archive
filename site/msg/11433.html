 I bought a Honda car radio a couple weeks ago that was exactly the same a=
s some I had bought over the years. I still the modules from one dated 2004=
, I mark the date when I got them. Apparently I didn't pay close enough att=
netion to the connections and couldn't get 2004 to work. I did get this yea=
r's to work, and used the same config on 2004, so now have both sets workin=
g.  A the topping is I found a technoo station that I can't get on the home=
 radio.  I like techno!
 
 Besides that, I was working on enclosures, that'=
s a major problem and expense. Today I was working ona fiberglass reinforce=
s card board enclosure. It's be nice a strong, butt U-G-L-Y!
