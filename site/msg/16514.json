In order to help develop some good testing for it, I think the first step is to get a common or official consensus or statement on what it is the Frank&#39;s Box is claiming to be doing.  This might seem a silly question, but I think it&#39;s important to make sure any testing doesn&#39;t go off in some irrevelevant direction.\n\nFrank - or anyone - what is a good official statement on what the Frank&#39;s box can do?"}
