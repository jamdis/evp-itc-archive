<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My name is Chuck and I stumbled upon this site and its information 
while trying to figure out what&#x27;s going on in my crazy life. Before I 
get into that let me explain a bit about myself. I am a  male in his 
30&#x27;s, who has Bachelors in Regional Development, with a minor in 
Computer Science. I work at a respective power plant company within 
Arizona doing GIS Tech Work. I get drug tested at it on random 
occasion and I really only drink socially, or on some holiday 
occasions. I have always been a logical kind of thinker my whole life 
and never really had any &quot;belief&quot; in the paranormal, even though my 
mom and brother strongly do. 

I feel so weird even trying to explain this story because about a 
week ago I would have thought of it as silly. About a year ago I met 
someone else, who for now ill call B. I fell madly in love with her 
and after a short time I was more than happy to have her come and 
live with me at my new place. In some strange way I always felt as if 
there was something about B I could never quite understand. After 
about 3-4 months of living with her I started to get the inclination 
that B was cheating on me. Her stories never added up, her job was 
secretive and she started stumbling on her words a lot. 

I then started getting spy gadgets, because she was staying with me 
and I was concerned about my place along with her activities there. I 
at first just got a digital recorder, but then after time I started 
to get aggravated and felt that the digital recordings were just 
being used to play and taunt me. So then I went to the extent of 
getting Cameras and even Camcorders. Whenever I would ask about 
something peculiar, I got tears and a really heartfelt reaction that 
really made me believe her. I felt like we really loved one another 
and I could really see some care in her eyes, so most of the time I 
just gave in to what she said as true, but didnt have enough to stop 
looking. I felt like I had been in enough relationships to know the 
difference here. I have seen the act before and it really didn&#x27;t look 
that way here, unless she was just really that good at fooling 
people. 

During the course of our stay there she would pitch a huge fit if I 
had to leave her at the apartment alone and would stop at nothing to 
try and be in my company instead. But I started to get aggravated as 
time progressed and knew something was up, because of the odd voices 
I would hear within the recordings. I made her stay there will trying 
to sneak back and see who was messing with her around my place. I 
lost it because I couldn&#x27;t pinpoint it at all and last July and got 
into a fight right outside of my place with three other people. She 
always told me she talked to her self when I qestioned other voices 
and I never could see anyone else there when she did, even with the 
cameras, so I had no choice but to continue on believeing her still
even though my feelings wouldn&#x27;t agree to her words. 

For some odd reason it just seemed as if she knew where the cameras 
and recorders were every time, just by the way she would exit and 
enter the apartment. So then I started putting them outside and about 
a month ago something crazy happened. I started listening to a 
digital recording and at the beginning of it I flat out heard B 
cheating on me with someone. I was upset and happy at the same time 
that I finally had caught it and as a result I sent her away. She 
left town because all her family was in another city. She couldn&#x27;t 
stop crying and was hysterical, especially when she saw I was 
devastated too. I thought that I had finally gotten my answers and 
she was just the best actress I had ever known, end of story. She 
tried to kill herself a couple of times while this was going on a 
couple months back. If it was as an act or not, I really just don&#x27;t 
know. But when she left last she left a note telling me not to let 
her die and she hopes that I find her soon before her heart stopped. 
Me..I said more BS and threw the note in the garbage. 

A couple of day&#x27;s later curiosity got the best of me and I started 
listening to the rest of the recording. I then started to hear what 
sounded like people monitoring ME and calling me a &quot;Threat&quot;. I 
immediately start acting alarmed. Then in the recording I hear B exit 
the apartment in disgust after I stormed off that night, as we were 
fighting about something weird yet again.  After I had left she 
started talking about setting up a &quot;Private Meeting&quot; with some other 
people and something about boating. Well during the beginning of this 
meeting I heard a reference to a crazy accusation that I had made at 
B awhile ago, which to me at the time confirmed she was in the Mafia. 
That explained all the weirdness to me and during this meeting the 
voices changed a bunch as if they sounded &quot;Masked&quot; or &quot;Disguised&quot;, so 
I really had to amp up the volume. 

The next day and every day after from this point on I amped up the 
volume in the recording. I also had to distinguish the masked voice 
by breaking the large file into smaller segments of two to four 
second intervals, in order to piece the entire recordings meaning 
together. Over time I started to interpret the masked voices better 
because I thought I was tuning my ears better to them. The voices in 
these recordings were two different males, B and some other female. I 
later on saw in the recording that they had actually seen the 
recording but weren&#x27;t taking it, which was EXTREMELY odd to me 
considering they had been caught. Why not destroy the evidence? 

Then I heard one of the males say that he was the &quot;Boss of the 
Southwest Mafia&quot; and that I was going to pay for hurting B like this. 
He also said that my being a nuisance in the apartment had messed up 
his business within the area and all my spy stuff had really pissed 
him off. He told me I was dead, my daughter along with me and more 
than likely my whole family as well. 

He knew where my mom and dad lived and some information I didn&#x27;t even 
tell B. I freak out and figure the damn mob is after me. I keep 
listening and he says &quot;If I don&#x27;t move away and discontinue my 
interactions with my daughter by December 5th, that he would know 
that I was just playing with B and then my whole family is dead&quot;. 
This was exactly one month from when I had used the recording device 
too by the way. I moved out and away from my daughter breaking the 
tie and in tears the whole time too because I couldnt explain why. I 
really did it because I feared for their lives of my family and felt 
that we would all die if f I didnt. 

Meanwhile B and met someone else that ill name J for now. After 
knowing him for two days she decided to bring him back with her to 
pick up her things out of the apartment. I was kicking her out of it 
by the way. I thought it was just to piss me off and I forgot about 
it. Then I heard as I progressed in the recording J&#x27;s name brought 
up. Supposedly they knew him and he was in their mob and I needed to 
go attack him to prove myself, or else B will never be seen from me 
again. I also hear that I can&#x27;t go to certain places at certain times 
where B might be and furthermore think that they didnt take the 
recorder because the damn thing has to be planned down to the times I 
would hear it. 

At this time I am in fear for my life and my families, lost my love 
and I am not understanding how the recording is so damn well time 
planned, figured im going crazy. Then something ill never forget 
happens. I am spoken directly too and I figure its me going of the 
deep end now. I try and test my sanity and go to different parts of 
the recording only to get the same thing kind of direct question. I 
am in disarray at this point! I stand up and walk around, trying to 
figure out just what the hell is going on with me. I get back on and 
further see that my verbal questions are now being answered instantly 
by this recording (Which is merely a sound file on the pc). *I was 
using Sound Forge by the way if anyone wanted to know what sound 
software I was using was*.

I have so little sleep at this point and I am told that I need to do 
all this crazy stuff and drive out to the middle of some hotel right 
then and there, to further see them, as I have passed all their tests 
to get into their mafia now. As a reward B would be there waiting for 
me too. I hurry to do it and rush there but no one is even their to 
answer the door. I go back and get a yelling voice at me that I had 
left to early and immediatly go back. Me not wanting to piss the mob 
boss anymore, I take the 45 minute trip again and go back. But when I 
get there it just didn&#x27;t feel right to me and I never exited the car, 
especially when I saw the numbers in vehicles hadnt changed in the 
parking lot. I had plenty reason to be paranoid at this point and 
truly felt in danger.I left and thought I was done for when I got 
back. Instead, he tells me that he was impressed by my decision when 
and literally puts me in tears when he said that because of my 
intelligence,  I had won my families lives back, but not my own yet. 

All this is done by him also telling me that he can physically see me 
through his advanced mafia technology on the computer monitor. He 
also tells me to to move things around on my compter desk that were 
between the sight of me and the computer monitor, while demanding I 
correct my posture when speaking to him. He also states that he is 
watching my every move and if I tell anyone anything they die along 
with me. 

I make no sense of this and I was completely baffled on how I was 
being communicated with. I had just moved and there was no internet 
connection even. Me just being happy my family is safe, I decide to 
go to sleep. Feeling as though I am now sleep deprived and going 
crazy from the stress, I go to sleep for two days consistently, as 
this was during the Thanksgiving holiday time. I would purposely make 
myself sleep longer when I woke to ensure I didn&#x27;t belong in the 
loony bin. 

When I finally woke up I was determined to find an explanation to how 
they were talking to me, I go to the library and look into Bluetooth 
technology, telephony, and remoting into a computer..anything. Then 
I realize..that I can find out just how crazy I really am by moving 
the recording and listening to it elsewhere. I then decide to take 
the same recording into my work to test my saneness, along with the 
file itself. If its was on my home CPU.then it&#x27;s going to now be at 
my work one too right? I do and get the same damn thing, not to 
mention that the &quot;Mob Boss&quot; now has company two others when I speak 
to him. All of them yelling at me for moving their sensive 
information. 

During this time I invest in GPS, GSM, 3G and several signal blocking 
devices, in order to prohibit myself from being tracked any further. 
They never worked or even phased the &quot;Mob Boss&quot;. But I would still 
check the recording in the evening just to hear what I needed to do 
in order to be making them happy and get the possibility to see B 
again. The &quot;Mob Boss&quot; had told me that it was all just a test for me 
to see if I loved her and she never really did do anything. They 
continue to tell me over and over that I have to beat up J in order 
to prove myself to B. That this is what everyone is really waiting on 
and if I would just go up to the other town and get it over with, 
then I can bring her back with me. I won&#x27;t do it and say that I won&#x27;t 
fight for anything that doesn&#x27;t want to be fought for. Basically 
saying that B can call me about it if she really wants it. Then as a 
result they start threatening my family again. At this point, I 
really can&#x27;t even express to you how much of a wreck I am. But I felt 
like I needed to be strong for my family and get on the mob&#x27;s good 
side so I can fix the mess I created.

Well it never really happened and this torment went on for a good 
week, while I was moving everything I could as fast as I could in 
order to make their deadline and save everyone. Everyday I would do 
what I thought was expected of me and hope it wouldnt make them mad 
in one breath, while in the other breath win back my complete 
freedom, away from their bad side. No matter where I was or what I 
did during the day they usually seemed to know about it when I talked 
to them in the evening. It really bothered me that I couldnt find out 
where they were putting the &quot;bugs&quot;, or even better how they were 
doing all of it. My inability to &quot;believe&quot; in the paranormal really 
hurt me here.

Since the apartment that B and I had used was empty at this time and 
a friend of mine was down on his luck, I gave him the apartment for 
free until the lease was completely up. After about a week of me 
doing this, I walked in and found guns and ammo everywhere and 
freaked the hell out. That&#x27;s the last thing I needed when I thought 
the mob was just down the street! I made everyone there except my 
friend leave, with quite a fuss I might add. Then I headed back to my 
home to see how the mob felt about what I did, assure they would be 
impressed that I had looked out for them. Instead the regular female 
that was always with the &quot;Mob Boss&quot; now asked me why I didn&#x27;t finish 
the job, stating that there was still someone there and it made them 
all angry. They demanded that I go back especially to see just how &quot;I 
finished it&quot;. 

So like the puppet I was at that time, I went back. I didn&#x27;t have the 
heart to put him on the street, even though he had put me at a major 
risk and instead I just found another place for him to stay. On the 
way there I bought him some water and some smokes. When we got there 
I even helped him move in and explained that it wasn&#x27;t me that did 
it, but the leasing office had saw all the guns. As a result they had 
made me do it. I thought he made a poor decision and I knew he saw 
the same, not to mention I kind of felt bad that I had to do all of 
this to him at 11:30PM. I truly didnt want to make his life a 
complete hell any more than it already was and he felt better that I 
had talked to him, so as a result I did as well. I then left and once 
again headed back home. 

Certain that I was going to get good praises; I sat at the PC again 
only to immediately get yelled at. They asked me why I was &quot;so good&quot; 
and that they had absolutely no respect for me. I tell them I just 
did all of that for them and they say that I always do things &quot;the 
right way&quot; and they hate me for it. This is where I think I hit the 
loony bin and just didnt see how I was going to fix this problem. 
Then it got worse and saw that my thoughts were now being 
communicated back to me. Then I knew it and was convinced I was going 
skitzo and that i was just truly arguing with myself in reality, 
especially when I saw I wasn&#x27;t even speaking. I used the restroom, 
splash water on my face and faintly start to hear the same mob people 
in my fan motor in the bathroom.  I haven&#x27;t drank, done any drugs 
(even prescription) and have a pretty complex job which I can still 
handle, but yet I feel like I am going crazy. 

I can&#x27;t talk to anyone about it so I sit back at the CPU, only to 
hear that I need to open up the front door. Screw that!I just look 
out the window and see nothing and say no way. They ask why not and 
that I should trust them and I say hell no and I continue to 
hear &quot;God Damnit&quot; from them when they get mad. They continue to ask 
me to open the door and I continue to check the window to see 
nothing. I say to knock then and they get mad and say they have no 
hands. They don&#x27;t sound like they are joking and get mad when I laugh 
even, so I continue to think I am just crazy at this point. I asked 
why they wanted to come in and they said they wanted to fix me. I say 
there is nothing wrong with me and they say they hate me and want to 
eat me.

I start to really think about this and say ill open the door if I get 
the answers to all this. They start saying things and its if as 
though they see my thought process develop and say things like&quot;watch 
him go&quot;. Then I hear out of my computer monitor something I couldnt 
even fathom. I hear my ex-wife&#x27;s ex-best friends voice. His name was 
Daniel and he had committed suicide over 5 years ago. I did know him, 
but not as well as she had. It WAS his voice and he said &quot;Charles its 
Daniel&quot; and then I heard their voice again say we are &quot;down here with 
him&quot;. At this point I didnt know really what to think, but this part 
in our conversation was the turning point on my beliefs and thoughts 
on what was really going on.  

I say nothing yet they somehow can seem to hear my thoughts and start 
saying little things to make me think even more. It was the most 
fluent conversation I had ever had. It was truly telepathic and was 
on a level I could never really explain even to myself. Then it 
really hit me and I said &quot;Demons&quot;. I tried to play something and got 
no response for the first time ever on the sound file. I then started 
piecing it all together from there and even though I wasn&#x27;t a 
believer this makes more sense then I could ever write down here and 
as a result I forever will be one now. 

They ask for me to now open the door and I open the small glass door 
on my CPU desk and they get really pissed off, saying I tricked them. 
Then their voice changed to the most demonic, vile and disturbing 
voice I could ever put into words. I never really thought of doing 
that until that moment and I think it was seen from them reaction, 
but it worked out quite nicely. I start saying the our father prayer 
and I can hear the displeasure in them even more and heard &quot;that&#x27;s it 
we are going in&quot;. I immediately took off my headphones and ran to get 
a bible they never did as far as I can tell, but I sat there all 
night with the bible in my hand praying. 

I started calling people and my phone started cutting out, the bulb 
on the porch blew and my good friend&#x27;s girlfriend called me to ask me 
for help because my friend was drunk and passed out. It sounded like 
she was trying to flirt with me and I asked her how &quot;A&quot; nightclub was 
and she said good and then I said didn&#x27;t you actually go to &quot;B&quot; 
nightclub actually and she switches her story. I hang up and call 
back with no answer. The time was only 1:10am and they never leave 
until the clubs close so this was even odder. 

I sat there terrified most of the night praying, until I called my 
brother who told me that I have to stand up to them or I am feeding 
into their fear. He like my mom has been involved in similar things 
like this but after talking to both of them, neither have on this 
level. But in a refreshing breath after talking to them about this, 
they did seem to believe me. But it wasnt unil I researched this 
issue and found out about EVP and how it works, did I truly know that 
I wasnt becoming a lunatic.

That brings me to today and me being at my wits end. I swear on 
everything this is all 100% true and I feel like I am crazy even 
still. Even though I hear it from no one else and have a pretty good 
circle of friends, not to mention that I still seem to do my job just 
fine as well. I havent put on my headphones or heard any voices since 
I tried to last listen to the recording, which was now 3 days ago. 
Does anyone have any help and guidance here, as this all has really 
destroyed my life. I deleted all the copies of the recording, except 
for one hardcopy. I still have the original recorder with the file 
on, but I haven&#x27;t tried to use the recording or recorder any further, 
as I refuse to continue it without any guidance. I figure its best to 
avoid them, like my brother said. Maybe someone can help me 
understand all of this.  Even if I have gotten rid of these things 
what does that say of B? I really spent a bunch of time making this 
really need some genuine help from someone in the know. I know it 
sounds crazy but please regard this all as true. I am new to this 
stuff and will just stay away from it now, but some kind of insight 
would be great.</pre>
