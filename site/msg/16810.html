What Frank is referring to is more properly termed a "Pseudo-Skeptic". 
Ind=

Skep=

pseu=

I've heard the same said for the evp researchers!  But it's not that 
si=
mple in either case:
the last block that you reference has small print that=
 says "Compare the 
hypothesis to the experiment's conclusion".  Which of c=
ourse you can't do 
unless you already visited the hypothesis block and hav=
e a hypothesis to 
which to compare.  That in turn has small print which sa=
ys "predict the 
outcome of the problem", which of course you can't do eith=
er unless you've 
already visited the earlier block of Purpose ("state the =
problem").

I don't think it's helpful to deny good evidence, whether it is=
 good 
evidence from someone claiming to have detected spirits, or whether =
it is 
good evidence from someone claiming that people can mistake noise fo=
r 
speech or random radio tunings for spirit control.  That's why the 
scie=
ntific method is valuable: it keeps both the skeptic and the believer 
real=
.
