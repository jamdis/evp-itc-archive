<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>One of your fellow countrymen (Lance Reed) came up with a great method
called the light feedback method that has really shown a lot of
promise. He has posted some examples and the setup over on the
ITCBridge Forum.

Take a look, he has done a great job.

&gt; A big hello to everyone,
&gt; I am the founder of the circle uk evp group
&gt; I have been recording Evp and capturing images for awhile now
&gt; Mind you i seem now to be hitting a blank wall with my images these 
&gt; past few months as i am working on a transparent method in the loop
&gt; Frustration can be an understatment on bad days,lol.
&gt; So i thought i would get a wee bit of advice on these other techniques 
&gt; people are now using,I also work with water and results there seem to 
&gt; be getting on fine.
&gt; I am not very techie minded although i try:-)
&gt; On the Evp side of things i have no problems as i get good/bad days 
&gt; like anyone else.
&gt; 
&gt;   Take Care
&gt;   Cat:-)
