<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Dave,

the &quot;Ohhhh yes&quot; file is of course absolutely clear. Did you slow it
down? It sounds so &quot;stretched&quot;.

From &quot;You hear the people&quot;, I can&#x27;t hear the &quot;peo&quot; from &quot;people&quot;.

And from &quot;The [peo]ple u[se the] test, you should [tape]..error&quot;, I
can&#x27;t hear the parts between brackets.

But that doesn&#x27;t mean anything, since we all have a different hearing,
and EVP are primarily for the person who gets them.

Stefan

&gt; Stefan,
&gt;  I tried your idea last night using your file and instructions and got some results. Most messages were two or maybe three words, only a couple were longer with any meaning. I&#x27;ll post a few here as
&gt; an example.
&gt; &quot;Ohh Yes&quot;
&gt; &quot;You hear the people&quot;
&gt; &quot;The people use the test, you should tape..error&quot;

&gt; Thanks for the excellent tip, this method appears to have great potential,
&gt; Dave

&gt; Hi Misty, &quot;inner energy&quot;, all,

&gt; maybe one could feed the SpeakJet allophones into EVPmaker. The attached
&gt; WAV file contains the 72 allophones of the SpeakJet chip. (I used
&gt; Audition to cut them out of the sample clip which has been posted here
&gt; recently, and store them in a cue list.) To use this file as an EVPmaker
&gt; source, the &quot;Use Cue List&quot; option must be checked. I have done a few short
&gt; sessions, and got this strange message:

&gt;                 &quot;I little Sir help you eclipse.&quot;

&gt; (Doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me... lol)

&gt; Of course, this cannot replace a hardware version of SpeakJet, since
&gt; EVPmaker isn&#x27;t able to produce the proper transitions between the
&gt; allophones. But maybe it&#x27;s worth a try...
