Not sure of the unzip process but I think I should be able to handle the download at my end.  Any other options.  I am in Mexico and can&#39;t seem to get reliable radio signals with my RS hacks.  Maype a computer based program like evpuk might be my best option.

The\nspiricom noise sounds a bit different than the one I had created by\nsimply mixing the 13 frequencies (131, 141, 151, 241, 272, 282, 292,\n302, 415, 443, 515, 653, 701 Hz); obviously not all of the tones have\nthe same level, and some vary constandly. I have a copy of the original\nSpiricom tape on which the sound of the voices can be heard. It&#39;s a\nrobotic like sound and it reminds me of Vocoder voices, or voices made\nwith these speech aid devices for people with larynx cancer (dunno the\ntechnical term for these devices).\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Hi Stefan,\n\n&gt; I have a program I got off the internet called &quot;EVP Assitant&quot;that has \n&gt; has the 13 tones of the old Spiricom Mk-4 system and it also has whiye \n&gt; noise and pink noise and a water fall audio files on it. IT&#39;S A FREE \n&gt; PROGRAM !!! So it might be of use in this itc group research. I \n&gt; thought I should pass that along if anyone wants a great little \n&gt; proggie. If it&#39;s free it&#39;s for me LOL. Just do a Google on EVP \n&gt; Assitant then you should find it easily. You could record the tones to \n&gt; a CD and use it that way or whatever. Well you all take care. Keep up \n&gt; the great research.\n\n&gt; Regards,\n\n&gt; Ralph the Ghost Hunter\n&gt; S.P.I.R.I.T.
