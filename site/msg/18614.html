i think that the most problem here is debbie because she can not stop to
flame and insulting you.
so, i like your ideas and tests, then your ideas and informations are for me
more welcome than the 
negative and insulting postings of debbie.
 
@debbie, why dont you open a group only for you? its really a pain to read
all the time your accusations.

BTW, if anyone is wondering what I am talking about, this was a good
example.
I offer a suggestion on getting things back on track with less hostility,
and I am immediately attacked for making the suggestion.

that would be fine, if you didn't piss Frank off....... But you do.....
AND THAT IS NOT OKAY.....
The same thing will happen when you do it again....
So what's the point in you being here.

I expect none of us like all the recent attacks, insults, accusations,
threats, hurting of feelings, and attempts to piss people off. 

Can I suggest we stick to the purpose of the group: "the discussion,
promotion, and developemnt of Electronic Voice Phenomenon, and Instrumental
Transcommunication methods and technologies as used in the communication
with spirit, and other entities."

And that we go with Frank's philosophy "just take the approach, try
different methods, see what works."

No more threats. No name calling, insults, or accusations. Just try to keep
a positive group attitude, be open that not everyone believes what everyone
else does, and that's ok?
