<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Indeed thanks for the great information. I don&#x27;t know why the thought
of a social system on the otherside is any new surprise to me, but it
makes sense. I would think that there are probably the same amount of
entities that would want to speak to as as there are us wishing to
communicate with them. I guess traditionally when one thinks of
paranormal research, we are already preboxing our thoughts to deal
with either the individual or small number with regards to spirits at
a specific location. Since ITC really know no bounds with regard to
location, it only makes sense, yet never occurred to me before your
reply Misty.

Thanks again
Andy

&gt; Misty,
&gt; Sounds like they could be a part of the lower realm entities that we
had discussed some weeks or a month or so ago. 
&gt; Thanks for you highly informative post!

term for it years ago. His meaning may differ from my own hehehe.
&gt; 
&gt; To me negs are everywhere. I pass them on the street every day. They
also occasionaly come thru in spirit form tho they dont have much luck
getting thru the barrier these days here. Many people have spoken of
being affected by what was said so much they stopped doing the work
completely. I tend to ignore them when/if they come thru and the group
tends to deal with them on thier end by blocking them out. 
&gt; 
&gt; I use to see alot more of that nature when I was at the early
stages. I also saw alot more of the &quot;help me&quot; types. I dont hear many
of those anymore, but now and then I do hear someone being shown the
way to the light or being ejected from communicating if the group
thinks they shouldnt be part of the session taking place.

&gt; &gt; Since my limited experiences have always been neutral or
&gt; &gt; positive in
&gt; &gt; nature, I was wondering what exactly these darkhead
&gt; &gt; entities were. The
&gt; &gt; information I have been able to glean off the internet so
&gt; &gt; far has been
&gt; &gt; fragmented, and mentions of them have always seemed to be
&gt; &gt; like an
&gt; &gt; afterthought. I was just curious if they are negative
&gt; &gt; entities that
&gt; &gt; attach and make life miserable for the operator or if they
&gt; &gt; are merely
&gt; &gt; spectral bullies that keep other entities from properly
&gt; &gt; communicating
&gt; &gt; during a session. I have seen them mentioned in passing
&gt; &gt; here and other
&gt; &gt; boards dedicated to itc/evp. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; thanks in advance,
&gt; &gt; Andy
