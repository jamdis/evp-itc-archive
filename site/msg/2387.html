<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I talked to Frank about an idea in a similar vein a while ago.  It&#x27;d
be simpler just to get a radio card for a pc (there are some with both
am and fm) and use that instead of trying to hack Wi-Fi.  You could
also reproduce the same electronics logic as software.

&gt; How would the wi-fi antennae work as compared to the current antennae?
&gt; Better or worse do you think? I guess I was thinking more along the
&gt; lines of recording directly into Adobe rather than broadcasting on the
&gt; web.

&gt; &gt;  Yeah, there was some discussion and work toward boradcasting live
&gt; streaming audio from the box onto the web, but all involved got kinda
&gt; sidetracked with other projects, but it hasn&#x27;t been forgotten. 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  The box is basically a swept radio tuner. Someone good at
&gt; programming could create a program to tune a radio on a plug in card,
&gt; making it sweep the tuning. You could do the same thing with a TV
&gt; tuenr on a computer card and get video images, as I&#x27;ve done with my
&gt; analog system.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  BTW, there is already a program which was the inspiration of the
&gt; boxes, it&#x27;s called EVPmaker, and it&#x27;s freeware.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hey folks, been reading for a long time and am finally posting. I
&gt; havea question in regards to a dream a friend had...The dream was
&gt; vague but in it a woman in her low to mid 30&#x27;s istalking about her
&gt; father who has figured out a way to run Frank&#x27;s Boxthrough a laptop.
&gt; End of dream. When the dream was relayed to me, mygut response was
&gt; &quot;Oh! They are using the wi-fi antennae&quot;. Now, don&#x27;tget me wrong. I&#x27;m
&gt; about as technical as a shoe string but the dreamcame across as a
&gt; strong message. Is this even possible? The only real &quot;visual&quot; of the
&gt; dream was as the voices are comingthrough, they are showing up on the
&gt; laptop as well... as if AdobeAudition or some other sound editing
&gt; program is being used inconjunction.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;
