Hi Misty,

I like what you said. You are right also in the fact that some k=
now more, some know less and some think they know it all.=A0

Thanks, Misty!

I had a guy named Steve=
 come through almost every session, so maybe he was my "tech." The last ses=
sion I had before the dry spell (when I quit for a while due to sickness), =
Steve was sort of flippant and gave a bunch of stupid answers, so now I'm k=
ind of hoping he's gone on vacation. But I did two sessions yesterday, and =
very little came through except for being told that a family friend has die=
d (I'm waiting to see if that bit of prediction has come true). So maybe, l=
ike you said, Steve "led" everyone and made things come through clearer. I =
guess time will tell. If he'd behave himself, I'd welcome him back.

So I'm=
 wondering, what's the rationale behind this comment:

First, the MiniBox w=
orks best with time. If you do not have two hours to devote to a session, y=
ou might be disappointed. You should have the device running in the place y=
ou will be using it for at least 15 minutes; during this time you can fine =
tune
 settings and volume. Never expect the Box to "Hit the ground running,=
" so to speak; it happens occasionally, that an operator can turn on the bo=
x and get an immediate message, but it hasn't happened often in the ASUP's =
tests.

http://www.asup- inc.org/interimm iniboxreport. htm

I can't imagin=
e the above quote is good advice. The very first moment I turned on my litt=
le hacked box, I got a clear, loud message: I see you. It freaked me out so=
 bad, I turned it off immediately and it took three days to work up the ner=
ve to try again! So I don't know what these people are talking about, that =
you can't hit the ground running. I've read about lots of folks doing just =
that.

I was kind of thinking that shorter was better, too, but I wanted to=
 make sure, because if I was wrong, maybe letting it run a long time might =
get even better responses... but yeah, I
 think they get tired, as it proba=
bly takes a lot of effort to form those words.

I was also thinking all tho=
se skeptics who say the boxes don't work are probably not treating their se=
ssions like EVP -- I can never hear much of anything during the session, on=
ly afterward when I listen back and at very high volume. At least for me, m=
ost of the bulk of the communication is very, very quiet and located in bet=
ween the louder snippets of strong-signaled radio announcer voices. I imagi=
ne it might be louder and clearer if I took my set-up to a haunted location=
 (or some place lots of human emotions were felt), but since my set-up isn'=
t really geared for that, I haven't done it yet.
