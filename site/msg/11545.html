<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Andrea,

This is my first post to the group as well.

Without knowing your house, could it be light reflection from outside
sources through a window?

That said, I certainly believe that spiritual beings can radiate a
light we can see with our physical eyes.  In my own case I primarily
work with spiritual energies outside the scope of human.  Mostly
angelic, sometimes not.  At one time, I was using Goetic magick to
summon a spiritual being.  I&#x27;m someone who discounted orb photos for
years.  But then while I was doing a summoning of a specific spritual
being, a golden light filled the room from above my head, moving from
right to left. It was as though a candle being lit and moving around
the room. All I saw was the light on the walls... I didn&#x27;t see the
source.  It blinked away after 5 seconds or so. I recall asking if
this was the being, and if so to repeat.  It occured again and on this
second attempt i actually saw a golden ball of light - about the size
of my fist, slowly move around the edge of my circle.  The room was
darkly lit with only one candle. there were no flashes or external
lights.  So it was quite remarkable when it occurred, as the light was
very noticable in that moment.  I never believed in orbs before... as
most photos of them I thought I could explain due to camera Flash. But
this wasn&#x27;t a picture imprint, it was real time with my eyes. 

That all said, it was a spiritual being who was manifesting and by
doing so, radiated a light that I could see with my own eyes.  

I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s happened for many others.  I&#x27;d first rule out any
possible external light sources that might have caused this.  Then if
all ruled out, work from there to understand what&#x27;s trying to manifest.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I am Andrea Carr who is a 41 year old wife and mom of 1 daughter. I
am sorry I have not written before but I have a terrible year and
haven&#x27;t had the time to concentrate on EVP like I had prior. I won&#x27;t
get into the details but it has left me in the midst of OK just trying
to pull through all of this BS &amp; I will get back to it when I can.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunatley I am leaving for the weekend tomorrow morning and
won&#x27;t see my e-mails until Monday morning. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have a question for any one here. I believe in aliens, spirit and
ghost communications via evp but tonight I had an experience I never
had before.
&gt; 
&gt; I woke up at exactly 2:22 by my stove&#x27;s clock and went and cleaned
my sink of dishes while I heated up some cream chipped beef (albiet
not too exciting) but while I sat there after in the dark with my
family sleeping my hallway ilummating a light clored blue several
times. Anyone else ever seen this?
&gt; 
&gt; I look forward to any responses.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Andrea
