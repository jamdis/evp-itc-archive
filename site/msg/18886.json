Anyone know?\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Tech David told me about this one guy over there, who always says one word, \n&gt;  that seems to be he only word he knows, its &quot;hore.&quot;  Don&#39;t take it  \n&gt; seriously because David the Tech, says that this fella is &quot;sick in the head&quot;  when \n&gt; he was a little boy women had rapped him and he was later murdered as a  \n&gt; teen.  He grew up over there, however he is mental, and needs prayer he  \n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to have anyone to move him on.  David asked me to have you  folks \n&gt; all say a little prayer for Calib that he may get better over there, so he  \n&gt; may move on, he is stuck in a partial dark plane because he has mind damage.  \n&gt; Tks. sf\n&gt;"}
