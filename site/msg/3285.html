Sum,
   
  I checked out the site. I almost felt I can do that! The only place I got lost is where a few others did in the "which one do i cut/pull" area if its not marked. But overall very good explanation for how to hack thier own radio and make thier own box. To me thats going in with Sumptions "build your own" ideas. Cheaper than most others approach (including Frank hehehe) yet its still along the lines of something we had discussed at an earlier date, he just didnt have the "parts" section worked out. It's easier perhaps to modify (hack) this radios parts so that most can do it.
   
  A few already have done it I see... cant wait to hear more from you all!
