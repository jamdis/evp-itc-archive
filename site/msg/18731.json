Could someone expl=\r\nain in simpler\nterms what this does and how? Apparently you need your own d=\r\nigital\nrecorder to record anything this picks up.\n\nAlso I noticed that this=\r\n the group mentioned who endorses this meter is\nalso the manufacturer.\n\nTha=\r\nnks for your help,\nCountry\n\n\nThe E.F.P. has been tested and is commonly use=\r\nd by the American\nParanormal Research Association, proving to be a valuable=\r\n tool when\nconducting E.V.P. investigations\n\nThe E.F.P.&#39;s &quot;real time, high =\r\nvisibility&quot; green with red\ncenter LED display, allows others to view E.V.P.=\r\n responses\neasily in dark locations. This feature allows users the\nability =\r\nto capture E.V.P. evidence on video. The device\nhas a &quot;white noise/ambient =\r\nnoise baseline adjustment&quot;\nallowing the user, to set the baseline level on =\r\nthe devices\nilluminated scale. This provides a &quot;visual reference&quot; to\nsee in=\r\n real time any &quot;addition&quot; or &quot;reduction&quot; of\nproprietary frequency noise. Th=\r\ne E.F.P.&#39;s built in circuitry\namplifies input signals to high levels allowi=\r\nng users to\nvisually monitor E.V.P. responses at higher resolution.

The E.F.P. also has (1) 3.5mm audio =\r\noutput\nwhich can be used for earphone or mp3 type speakers.\nThe E.F.P. has =\r\na &quot;manual on/off switch&quot; and built in &quot;push\nbutton single LED navigational =\r\nlight&quot;. The E.F.P. operates\non one standard &quot;9volt&quot; battery.
