Upon trying to figure out just where to do my sessions this \n&gt; afternoon, I had a idea.  Call me crazy but I plugged my camcorder \ncord \n&gt; into the imputs on the back of my tv and into the hacked!  The sound \n&gt; clarity was amazing!!!  It is amplied 10 times the amount from the \n&gt; computer and if you place the recorder next to the surround sound, \nit \n&gt; picks everything up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone else tried this?   Please let me know?\n&gt; \n&gt; Juli\n&gt;"}
