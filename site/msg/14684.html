my old man on a many job sinhce I was 8 and never had seen anything like th=

an handle that in a house. worste case of emf I have ever seen was a fancy =
chandaler that someone had over sized bulbs in and that thing flared up the=
 whole house to very dangerous levels. when they say 60 watt max they mean =
it for your own safety. this thing had around 10 100 watt bulbs in it and t=
he emfs were causing all kinds of nice images after 30 minutes in the house=
 we were having them too.

Yes.=A0 Also faulty wiring, =
which is even more dangerous.
Also with flakey transformers or other power =
distribution in the area, or power lines.
Perhaps you can check with some n=

Hi All,
=A0
Is there someone here that can answer a=
nd electrical question for me?
=A0
During the case that I recorded those po=
ssible EVP's-there was a loud tapping noise that seemed to come from the 2n=
d bedroom. Upon checking my logs, every time one of=A0 these clicks were he=
ard, there would be an EMF spike in the livingroom. The 2nd bedroom is upst=
airs, the livingroom downstairs. The home owners have also reported that th=
ey have a touch lamp that comes on all the time by itself and the lights in=
 the Kitchen will dim occasionally.
=A0
Now these taps are not consistent i=
n timing, loudness or rhythm. Could this be the work of faulty breakers?
=
=A0
Thanks!
April
