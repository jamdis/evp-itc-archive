Hey Debbie,
   
  Great clip thanks for sharing that.  Got some good EVPs there and the image on tv was  good too. 
   
  But I gotta ask ya....did that Meredith gal bug ya with, what seemed like, constant freaking out? Maybe its just the way they edited the show, but she seemed to freak out over everything.  Was it really as often as they showed it to be or was it more of their creative editing handywork?
   
  Rhonda
