Like all fuzzy kids should be =)
   
  Ive been studying antennas, parabolic, biquad, and cantennas in general. I just realized that one of the first things I "built" was a cantenna like reciever for my mic. I didnt have a clue at the time thats what I was doing LOL and its only to enhance the sound quality even tho I have it directed at the wall.
   
  Thats the thing about the voices with building, I just dont get it. Like Otto said I am not scientific enough LOL. But I did it and it worked and now that I stumbled onto the other stuff I just may go back and redo it the right way. Mines just made outta tin foil, pretty lame I know but tin foil or not it does help.
