The &quot;ringing sound&quot; are the typical\nartefacts that arise when noise reduction is overdone.\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Please don&#39;t laugh.  I tried to clean it up using wavepad, but their \n&gt; was this annoying ringing sound I tried to get out of it.  I got all of \n&gt; this message when the radio shack hack was scanning the band, and it \n&gt; all in a row no cut and pasteing or taking out garbage.  I will remove \n&gt; this pretty quick because its embarassing, so you might want to listen \n&gt; to only a few seconds in it. It might be anonying lol I will post the \n&gt; original if anybody is interested.\n\n&gt; William Rees C.\n\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links"}
