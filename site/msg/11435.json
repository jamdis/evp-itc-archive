Here&#39;s the article:\n\nhttp://www.stefanbion.de/evpmaker/random-bit-generator/index_e.htm\n\nA first EVP test session with this RBG seemed promising...\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Hi all,\n\n&gt; I remember that someone had selled a &quot;raudive diode&quot; build into a\n&gt; microphone plug, which is very similar to a crystal radio. It\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t be difficult to solder a diode, 2 resistors and 2 capacitors\n&gt; into a plug and test it. The schematic is here:\n&gt; http://www.worlditc.org/c_04_s_bridge_10.htm\n\n&gt; BTW, can anyone recommend a (tested) schematic for a simple random bit\n&gt; generator that can be connected to the LPT port? It should be able to\n&gt; deliver about 10,000 random bits (TTL level) per second. I&#39;d like to\n&gt; add an option for connecting an external &#39;hardware&#39; random number\n&gt; generator to EVPmaker.\n\n&gt; Stefan\n\n&gt; P.S.: A new EVPmaker version is available for download on my website:\n&gt; http://www.stefanbion.de/evpmaker/\n&gt; It has some additions as for instance 2 new random sources (Internet\n&gt; and &quot;manual sweep&quot;), and a new &quot;live audio source&quot; mode."}
