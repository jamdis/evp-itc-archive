Very nice Job Tim, and thanks for sharing your files with us. The communica=
tion is clear to me. Look forward to hearing more soon.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re:=
 Greetings

=C2=A0 

Thanks for listening to the audio I posted.

I have an=
 older model Minibox Plus. The boxes are hella expensive, and I was lucky e=
nough to find a man selling one who really needed the money at the time so =
I got a great deal.

They are made by Ron Ricketts of Paranormal Systems ou=
t of Texas. As the story goes, Ron is an electrical engineer and a member o=
f paranormal group. They group he is with wanted to explore the Frank's Box=
 phenomena so he built one based on Frank's schematics a couple of years ag=
o to find out what the fuss was about. Liking what he heard, he decided to =
go into business by making these boxes for production. The circuit boards a=
re pressed, the whole unit is in a pre-fab plastic case. It runs AM band on=
ly, the antennae is internal (with crystal enhancement) connected to an out=
side post extension, has seven different frequencies sweeping modes, user f=
requency sweep rate adjustments, and it has an internal battery. Interestin=
gly enough, my internal antennae broke the solder point internally from the=
 post and it gets even better reception now. 

The Minibox has an internal =
amplifer (300mW) which is enough to power a small external speaker badly. T=
he reason my files are so clear is because I run my sessions very different=
ly than other Minibox users. I take the amp out from the box and run it int=
o an external 7 watt / 4 ohm amp designed by Ron to work with this box. I l=
ike having the amplified sound, but the internal amp is noisy so when this =
noise is amplified, I get a lot of hiss. But, it also allows me to achieve =
really loud volume. The louder I make the volume, the lower I can set the s=
ensitivity and still be able to hear it. The box itself has two knobs, volu=
me and sensitivity. So I set the sensitivity to the point where it gates ou=
t most sound, then I tweak it gently while I crank the volume. My hand is a=
lways on the sensitivity knob and I cannot explain it, but I "feel" when to=
 open the gate a little more to add in some more sound and when to back off=
 and close the gate some more to cut out
 sound.

This is how I keep all ot=
her frequencies out and limit radio chatter considerably. I have found that=
 the Others have learned to work this box with me. It took time, a little o=
ver a month or so of using it every night until I could communicate clearly=
 using this box. I have often asked them before if they want me to switch t=
o a different mode of frequency sweeping (I currently use random jump) and =
I always get "No" as a reply. They seem to be happy with the way it works n=
ow, I only wish that some of their replies did not get cut off. 

As a resu=
lt, the responses take a little longer, as you can hear, some sentences for=
m over several seconds, but they are often very clear individual words or p=
hrases. They have told me that the clicking sound you hear is them trying t=
o manipulate the sound so they can speak.

As for recording, I record with =
a standard sony stereo digital recorder set up about 3 feet from the speake=
r, and I do my editing in Audition. Nothing has been manipulated, just slic=
ed and put into a file.
