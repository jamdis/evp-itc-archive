I agree that the voices come to you in your ho=
me, I think we can all agree on that.


As a ghost hunter, locations allow =
you access to voices that would otherwise never find you. =C2=A0I am not su=
re why this is, but it seems that the spirits like to hang around certain a=
reas. =C2=A0I know that radius has nothing to do with it because I have bee=
n on hunts hundreds of miles from my house and I get the same voices I have=
 at home. =C2=A0I have also been on hunts far from my home where I met some=
one new on the other side that was there again when I turned my box on at t=
he house!


I love the idea of doing GBC at home and I try to get in at lea=
st 2 sessions a week. =C2=A0But, going to a location has its perks too. =C2=
=A0You can find out names and historical facts that you wouldn't know other=
wise. =C2=A0If you go to a place it seems like you announce yourself to a n=
ew group of people when you turn on your box, and you never know, those peo=
ple might stick with you for a while.


It has always puzzled me how they r=
ecognize me when I am on no matter where I am. =C2=A0One of the greatest pi=
eces of evidence we can gather is having the same voice communicate with yo=
u in different parts of the country.


As it has been stated before, you ca=
n use a box anywhere there is a radio station and you'll get something. =C2=
=A0But, the more places you travel too, the more access you have to a growi=
ng chorus of voices.
