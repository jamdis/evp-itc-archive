Debbie,
 
I completely understand what you mean.  I did =
work with another group
but was not committed to them.  And later people go=
t in a pissing match
about me.  In a statement about me it was said to some=
one...."why are
you talking to MY PEOPLE".  And I just said excuse me, who =
am I?  i am
use to working together as a group and not being used and that =
is what
happened, I was USED.  And I will never put myself in that position=

again.  I feel that the information I get on an investigation should be
pu=
blic for all to see and hear.  And not be privately used for someone
else's=
 selfish agenda.
