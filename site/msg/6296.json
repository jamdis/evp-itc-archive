Before I gave it a test\nrun, I made it clear I was only doing a test and that I did not intend\nto make any contact.  About half way through the first sweep, I heard\nmy name.  \n\nVery exciting and somewhat startling at the same time.  Hopefully I\ncan get time to do an actual session tonight.  I understand it can\ntake some time for the box to get &quot;imprinted&quot; as Bruce says.  \n\nThank you Steve for finding this hack and thanks to the others here\nfor your endless help to everyone on the board.\n\nJeremy"}
