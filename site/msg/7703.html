<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Nellie,

&gt; Actually, this gives me an idea. On the low tech end, I wonder if justusing humming as a base would give the spirits the energy andfrequencies they need to form the sounds of language. I will play withthis and let you know if that pans out.

If this worked, we would be a big step further, since it would be very easy to seperate the humming from the voice afterwards, leaving the undistorted EVP. But unfortunately, experience teaches us that it&#x27;s not sufficient to provide a uniform signal as a base; the sound source has to vary aperiodically, it works best with a speech-like signal. This - among other observations - lead me to the conclusion that EVP is not a question of energy but rather a question of information.

But this is only my personal interpretation; other experimenters may have different experiences. So please ignore this and try using humming! :-)

Stefan</pre>
