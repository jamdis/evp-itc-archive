&gt; Hi Ron,
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully your sister has received the radio already.  It got 
shipped 
&gt; priority mail.  Have fun with it.  I really like the way the FM 
scan 
&gt; rate is....

&gt; &gt; I will be traveling to San Diego from Mexico to visit my sister 
and 
&gt; pick up the RS 125 Mike is sending me.  I will be in the San Diego 
&gt; and El Centro area from Feb 15 to 19 and I would love to be able to 
&gt; meet-up with someone from the area who has experience with EVP 
&gt; technology.  Mike is sending a box already hacked so we can work 
with 
&gt; the box and hopefully get something recorded.  Since I have little 
&gt; experience as a newbie to this, I would love to see how someone 
puts 
&gt; all of it together...recording, analyzing, etc.  
&gt; &gt;    
&gt; &gt;   If you have the time and are willing to give a little on-the-
job 
&gt; training, please let me know by email.  By the way, in mid June I 
&gt; will be traveling from Penn. to NC for two weeks and would love to 
&gt; get together with folks over in that area.  I will probably be 
&gt; ordering a mini-box to be sent to my folks house in Allentown, so I 
&gt; will have that to play with.  Let me know.  Ron Lederer
