The files and links sections as well as archive \nmessage search should answer most of your questions (if you have any) \nor feel free to post and ask. Everyone is usually more than willing \nto help out.\n\nLast but not least.\n\nMessages not going through right away sometimes? Believe me I know it \ncan be aggravating. I assure you it is nothing we (owners/moderators) \nare doing. For those of you that it marks as spam we have no idea why \nit does that. It&#39;s done it to both of the Franks. It&#39;s not like your \nnew here or anything weird is in the posts LOL.\n\nFrank S set the group up as unmoderated so I dont know why it picks \non a few of you now and then and holds your messages until one of us \napproves them (which we always do when we get online). \n\nThe YaNOhoo software has its faults as well as its advantages. So \nthanks for your patience when it occasionally kicks into spamcop mode.\n\nMisty"}
