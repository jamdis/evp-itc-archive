Well, if I one day have no shoes, had to live on the street (God Forbid),  
and could not even take a shower, I would stand in the line a mile long 
hoping  to get a bed for the night with all the other poor people, I wonder if I 
could  get a job, and find my way out of a mess without anyone else's help, 
I wonder if  I could do that all by myself.  I really doubt it, people need 
people, like  that one ghost lady said, that recording really tells all.

The only way I would ever "help" a ghost  is by telling it that it has the 
power to find a way out the  predicament itself.

We all have our own beliefs. I make no judgements on the living or the  
dead. I just communicate and record. I am an Empath, not a priest. Many,many  
spirits have asked me for help. If they can help themselves, they do not  
seem to know how. The prisoners believe that they would be trapped. if they  
died there. Are they imprisoned by their own beliefs?

In a way, I agree. "Stuck" implies  accidental. If a ghost is hanging 
around, it there by choice, whether it is  fully aware of that or not.

I don't believe in trapped/lost souls, I think that's  Hollywood. The 
trouble with doing investigations, I think, is you get  the evidence you expect 
to get, so it will tend to support the concept of  stuck souls. When I record 
it supports my concept of sprits travel, and  hauntings are for show. Which 
is correct?--both at one time or another.  

I did a recording at lunch time, at home, and in it a voice  says 
"ghost--right behind you". I was recording open air with the test  board running.

Well, stand outside the thing, and help  those poor souls out, here they 
are making money at the cost of lost  souls who are asking for help.  Shame on 
them, don't they realize  how many lost souls there are out there, waiting, 
go back (a few  thousand years worth of them,)  were I to name all the 
tribes,  country, religions, throughout the years, people that died trapped, in  
various places over century's, and yes there are thousand's of them in  the 
world, just dwelling in a cell of their own making, no progression,  no 
light, no hope, without people they love, and who wait still  loving them, they 
exist in these dark places without God.  This  mission should be to help 
them get back to God, back to the light of  God, light of Universe however, we 
want to call it, but in that light is  love and happiness.  Just my take, sf

Yes, you need special permission. I was there for an all night  ghost hunt 
as a guest of Eastern Paranormal. The place can be rented  at night but 
believe me when I say "it ain't cheap". Plus I don't  think the prison would 
appreciate me releasing the  inmates before their eternal sentence has been 
served..

Does one need special permission to get in  there?  You folks should go 
back, and release them since a few of  them already know you Steve, this is 
Steve?  Right?   sf

Unfortunately I did not get to attempt to cross them. After my  
demonstration, another group that was also there started complaining  that the box made 
too much noise and was hendering their  investigation so I turned it off. I 
wouldn't want my  direct communication with the deceased inmates to mess up 
their  EVP work, now would I? I apoligized and put it away for the rest of  
the night.
 According to the prison staff, the inmates firmly  believed that if they 
died in prison their souls would be  forever trapped there. This belief was 
so strong that the  prison officials would take the elderly inmates who were 
dying of  natural causes to a local hospital so they would'nt have  to die 
in the prison. Maybe their beliefs were well founded.

This is a wonderful recording, were  you able to free any of them?  So sad 
to see them still there  behind bars, must be very lonely for them, they 
should be moving on  so, they can start to work on making up for things on the 
other  side.  You folks should go up there again, and hold a small  prayer 
vigil for them, of course they would no longer be ghosts  trapped there, but 
there are plenty more around.  sf

I was invited to spend the night in the West Virginia  Penitentiary this 
past weekend... I was asked to give a short  demonstration with my Optimus 
12-797 hacked radio. Deep inside the  prison surrounded by concrete and steel, 
the radio could not pick  up any radio stations in manual mode. I wasn't 
sure how this might  effect the demonstration. I was pleasantly surprised with 
the  results. I recorded the session and the results can be heard at  this 
link. _http://www.youtube. com/watch?  v=KwDYu4RULlk_

            <DIV> According to the prison staff, the inmates fir=

            believed that if they died in prison their souls would be =

            forever trapped there. This belief was so strong that the=
 
            prison officials would take the elderly inmates who were dyin=

             <P>I was invited to spend the night in the West Virginia 
    =
          Penitentiary this past weekend... I was asked to give a short 
  =
            demonstration with my Optimus 12-797 hacked radio. Deep inside =
the 
              prison surrounded by concrete and steel, the radio could=
 not pick 
              up any radio stations in manual mode. I wasn't sur=
e how this might 
              effect the demonstration. I was pleasantly =
surprised with the 
              results. I recorded the session and the r=
esults can be heard at 
              this link. <A title=3Dhttp://www.yout=
