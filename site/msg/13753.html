 Exactly. And it may even be that it's both-sometimes it is us, but once in=

 I tried an Ouija board once. My brother and I were given one by my grandmo=

 The reason I have my doubts is that you have to be touching the planchette=
 to get it to move. If it were an actual spirit, I would think that shouldn=
't be necessary. We all know ghosts can a do move objects.
