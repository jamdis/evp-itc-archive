Laura,
   
  if they are they grey and white ones(front panel is white on top and grey on bottom with silver buttons and the back panel is all white) then they are the older models of the 470...definately buy them both if you are able to.

          Bruce, Yes, I will be checking them out again to make sure. They 
are grey and white, and come in a box that is either white and 
magenta or white and red...
If they are the old, I will get both and give them away for cost only 
to someone that needs one. I'll just wait to find out who in time.
Thanks for the info.
