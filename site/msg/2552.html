<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am willing to do a session over Skype.  I have before with some 
success.  If you want to do a box session, my name on there is 
keyportparanormal.  It would be good if we can get a few people on 
there at one time in a conference call.  I&#x27;d like to see the 
results.  Maybe we can set a certain time each week aside for this 
project...not a bad idea.  All calls welcome to interested parties.  
I could record it and send the file out to others that were involved 
in the call and we can all go over the file seperately and than 
compare our findings later.  I have the Joe&#x27;s box and if Frank wants 
to be involved in like a 10 minute session with his box, that would 
be great.  Any more than 10 minutes takes too long to go over.  Let 
me know.

&gt; Can I do a Scole thing with somebody? I&#x27;ve got Skype-- Can I phone 
it

&gt; 
&gt; ;)  (But a smidge more than halfway serious)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I&#x27;ll listen to the C2C show tomorrow and see how it went. 
Let  
&gt; you know what I think then.

&gt; &gt;  We were supposedly working together to do a &quot;Scole&quot; like thing  
&gt; &gt; here weekly starting last month, but that quickly bit the dust 
as  
&gt; &gt; Moon doesn&#x27;t seem to understand weekly, nor consistencey, as 
the  
&gt; &gt; first voices requested. He also never said anything about being 
on  
&gt; &gt; C2C again, and &quot;Frank&#x27;s Box&quot; will be  specifically discussed, 
as  
&gt; &gt; mentioned in the show promo on the C2C site. I think niether 
Moon,  
&gt; &gt; nor the C2C staff want facts to interfere with the discussions! 
I  
&gt; &gt; think he can stick his &quot;Scole&quot; meetings, and any other scams up 
his  
&gt; &gt; -----, and may he get the spirit contacts he deserves!

work  
&gt; &gt; with Frank&#x27;s Box, a device which summons the dead&quot;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Great, once again making public claims about a system he&#x27;s 
never  
&gt; &gt; paid a dime for, makes untold amounts of money with, has no  
&gt; &gt; knowledge of how it works, and what it&#x27;s really for....on and 
on!  
&gt; &gt; better hit send before I really get pissed!

&gt; &gt; Frank-- are you and he speaking or on the outs? I think I may 
have  
&gt; &gt; missed a rapprochement between you this summer when I was off 
in  
&gt; &gt; the wilderness camping.
