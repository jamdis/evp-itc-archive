<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all,

I remember that someone had selled a &quot;raudive diode&quot; build into a microphone plug, which is very similar to a crystal radio. It shouldn&#x27;t be difficult to solder a diode, 2 resistors and 2 capacitors into a plug and test it. The schematic is here: http://www.worlditc.org/c_04_s_bridge_10.htm

BTW, can anyone recommend a (tested) schematic for a simple random bit generator that can be connected to the LPT port? It should be able to deliver about 10,000 random bits (TTL level) per second. I&#x27;d like to add an option for connecting an external &#x27;hardware&#x27; random number generator to EVPmaker.

Stefan

P.S.: A new EVPmaker version is available for download on my website:
http://www.stefanbion.de/evpmaker/
It has some additions as for instance 2 new random sources (Internet and &quot;manual sweep&quot;), and a new &quot;live audio source&quot; mode.

&gt; &gt; Has anyone tried wiring a crystal radio set into input mic jack on pc 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve an idea that this could be tried using EVPmaker to boost input 
&gt; &gt; signal.  Any other ideas regarding crystal radio anyone.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Ray,
&gt; 
&gt; I have recently built a Raudive detector into a metal 1/8 inch phone
&gt; jack for a friend, using surface mount coil and 1/8 watt resistor with
&gt; a regular crystal diode. This is basically an untuned crystal radio
&gt; and detects all radio signals at the same time.
&gt; 
&gt; I didn&#x27;t get anything but noise for the short time I had it...but my
&gt; friend is happy.
