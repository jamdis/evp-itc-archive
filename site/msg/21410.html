<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>When my group was there, the rest of them went on the tour I got stuck setting up the cameras and connecting all the wires to the DVR system.  We had two cameras set up in #11, so i got to spend more time in there than the rest of our group did.  When we decided on who was going where me and two other friends chose #11 to go in first.  Then you seen the video I made while we were in there.  THen when the time came to clean up I was back in there.  It has been a couple years since we were there, but I remember just wanting to GET OUT of the casement 11, I couldn&#x27;t imagine being locked in there as a prisioner.  Seeing their signiture on the walls, and the bars on the door.. etc.  I have a little Claustrophobia so even though I probably spent the most time in there, I wanted out of there.

Its a neat place and would go back in a heartbeat if I had the chance!
