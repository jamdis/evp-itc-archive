As has been said,=
 one of  the most likely explanations  for the Ouija is 
the working of the=
 mind.
What is somewhat at issue, as is so often the case when discussing  =

apparent discarnate 
communications, is the actual source of the apparent =
 intelligence.
 
Micromuscular reactions do indeed appear to be one source =
of the  Ouija 
when operators are
in contact with the planchette. But this =
is only one category of  Ouija 
interactions. There is
another completely d=
ifferent category where no operator is touching  the 
board or the planchet=
te,
and yet it moves and remains in motion, often changing directions  or 
=
flying off the board. This
type of activity is more akin to psychokinesis, =
the mind affecting  the 
environment.
 
Both types of activity could be med=
iated in the mind of a living  operator, 
and in fact modern
parapsychology=
 research suggest this is the most reasonable  explanation. 
But again the =

source of the information thus presented is at question and is  currently =

unknown.
 
Against this backdrop it would seem that it would be quite  dif=
ficult to 
demonstrate with
any clarity or precision that any specific indi=
vidual (living or  deceased) 
was indeed affecting
the Ouija (or any other =
device for that matter). It would all come  down to 
beliefs which is the
b=
est we can hope for at this time.
 
So 'scientific' proof per se is off the=
 table if you define  'scientific' 
in the classic sense.
If you mean objec=
tive proof, in some way documenting activity such  as by 
video for example=
,
that is a different matter. But to be very clear, this would not be  
con=
sidered scientific proof
because you are cannot demonstrate the causation. =
You can however  document 
the effect.
 
Blood Mary (the ritual of Mary Wor=
th) is considered by most to be  
folk-legend. So it would 
be difficult, w=
ould it not, to ascertain who in fact you were  communicating
 with. And ag=
ain, 
there is a real possiblity, based on existing lab research  from the =
past 
many decades that 
you just might be communicating with yourself.
 
B=
est of luck in your endeavors!

Hey guys,

I am doing some rese=
arch on the Bloody Mary  ritual and Ouija Boards. I am  
looking for anyone=
 with stories  or experiences from those that would be 
willing  to share t=
hem  - as well as any research and evidence you may have 
gathered  from  t=
hem. I am looking to bring the folklore together with the  
history, scienc=
e and  experience.

Thanks.
