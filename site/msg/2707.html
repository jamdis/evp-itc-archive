<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Misty,

That&#x27;s what I get too... that high pitched feedback sound that 
crescendo&#x27;s... 
I&#x27;m using DC Seven now to see if it&#x27;s any better but still having the 
same problem and the software seems quirky. But unlike DC Six&#x27;s trial 
version, DC Seven allows one to keep recording live with no time 
limits. So if you try this software out again, download the trial 10 
day version of DC Seven... Anyway, I tried out each of the filters 
and some are better than others in keeping that feedback in check. 
But here&#x27;s what I know so far:
-- when I talk into my mic, I talk right into it and not at a 
distance -- and whisper as opposed to talking in my normal voice when 
I&#x27;m asking any questions where I hope to get a response on and I 
do .. so this is absolutely amazing! But by talking into the mic this 
way keeps ones voice from echoing too much.. some filters are better 
than others. Using no filter at all, at least on my computer echos 
too much.. 
-- Still, whenever a spirit speaks,its voice has that echoing effect 
where we hear what it&#x27;s saying over and over until it dies down -- 
then the next thing it says does the same thing. Attached in one of 
my evp&#x27;s I recorded when using this software. As you see, the spirit 
is talking but that voice is echoing a lot. The first part says &quot;It&#x27;s 
Linda&quot;... followed by &#x27;cigerette&#x27; over and over too. I was holding up 
a cigerette and asking for anyone to tell me what it is. They 
answered that question. 

-- The save feature is disabled on the trial versions of this 
software but have been able to get around that by opening up cool 
edit, clicking on record and then switching back to DC Live and 
clicking Live Preview. Whatever was coming over the DC Live preview 
was being recorded by Cool Edit where I had my mic close enough to 
the speaker for it to record but not close enough to cause any 
feedback. But as you know, that feedback problem is there with DC 
Live anyway but because I have a volume control on my speaker, I can 
adjust the volume to keep it from going into a screeching high pitch. 
Lol... it&#x27;s complicated. 

I just don&#x27;t have a clue how the 2 people in the 2 links below were 
able to get the recordings they did using this software where from 
listening to their recordings, it appears that they are not having 
that feedback problem. I wonder how they did that?

Lol... if they got it working then they must have been doing 
something right! 
Here&#x27;s a link with the recording I made using this software:

&gt; Welcome back Linda.
&gt;    
&gt;   Yeah I have that, tried it, couldnt figure it out, havent had 
time to try it again yet. Theres a couple around who have used it 
successfully. One is out of town but she may reply when she gets back.
&gt;    
&gt;   For me it just kept feeding back louder and louder until it was 
overwhelming loud noise, so I was doing something wrong.

&gt;           Hi,it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve logged on here but just 
popping in to 
&gt; say hi gang! Glad that y&#x27;all are here!
&gt; 
&gt; I saw some information in another ITC forum about DC Six, an audio 
&gt; editor that allows one to record EVP in Real Time... and it&#x27;s 
&gt; awesome! Has anyone here tried out the demo version of this program 
&gt; that&#x27;s now been updated to DC Seven? 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with it and it&#x27;s really amazing. I 
&gt; can talk into it and some of my EVP contacts answer back right 
away. 
&gt; But because I am not knowledgeable about sound recorders except for 
&gt; the basics when it comes to editing my EVP, I would like to know if 
&gt; someone here could download the 10 day trial version of DC Seven 
and 
&gt; let me know what you think about it. I&#x27;m having a few problems with 
&gt; getting it to work as it&#x27;s probably supposed to work... mainly 
having 
&gt; a problem with feedback and so on.. 
&gt; Here&#x27;s the link to DC Seven&#x27;s 10 trial demo:
&gt; http://www.enhancedaudio.com/dc_seven.htm
&gt; Hope someone here will try it out because I would love to know if 
it 
&gt; works for you!
