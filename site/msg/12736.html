I actually read about this a few months back (I forget where).  The EVP guy was getting them
even inside Faraday cages (properly grounded also) and because of that, he only considers EVPs that
were recorded from inside the cage.

It was pretty fascinating stuff.  You can probably find the page from searching for EVP and Faraday cage.
Actually as I type this, I think it was an actual book I was reading.

I've not gotten that far yet.  I'm still working on getting ANYTHING :)  Once I start getting stuff then I'll 
move to the cages.

Don

Well, since a spirit can most likely go anywhere, I'd think one would have 
no trouble getting into a Faraday cage.  If someone got a real EVP inside 
one, it would have to come from something that was capable of influencing 
things inside the cage. The source of the recorded sounds would not be an 
electromagnetic signal outside the cage.

Looks like an interesting experiment!
