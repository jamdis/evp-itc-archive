<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I haven&#x27;t noticed that any spirits have set up house with mme because I communicate with them. I have spirits here already since I collect haunted objects, but they have gotten quiet since they&#x27;ve settled in years ago.

&gt; It is interesting that you posted this because I was thinking of asking the group if using the box, a digital recorder, EVP Maker, and the like created any odd occurences in your home. I have had things happen and it always seems to be after I have spent some time trying to communicate with one of those methods. Does this kind of communication bring spirits into your home? Has anyone else had similar experiences to Rick?
&gt; Thanks,
