&gt;   Huh!? I can only say, I don&#x27;t have to do this group thing either, 
I 
&gt; stay cuz a few request it. The guys actually talk more if I don&#x27;t 
&gt; share. 
&gt; 
&gt; I can understand where Bruce was coming fom, to a point, but when 
&gt; you start making threatening private e-mails to make sure everyone 
&gt; agrees with you, that&#x27;s just demented and wrong. This shit ain&#x27;t 
&gt; that important!

&gt; &gt; Interesting message Frank considering the events that have 
&gt; unfolded over the last couple of days. Kind of like shooting
