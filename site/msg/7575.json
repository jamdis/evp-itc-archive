The uploaded preceding files were from a new spirit box \nI am testing that scans to strong signals only on the FM band, with \nscan rate and range adjustments.  This method is different sounding, \nbeing somewhat choppy, but may yield clearer audio.  The downside, as I \nhave been discussing elsewhere, may be the lack of weaker signals \nbetween, and less white noise to be utilized.  I&#39;ll keep working with \nit and post my results as I have them.  If spirits can manipulate \naudio, then this method may have merit, too. ;)\n\nLC\nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com"}
