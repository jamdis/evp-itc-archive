A file's content, it's integrity, is simply the bytes (and their bits) in t=
he file.=A0 If the file's content integrity is changed, that is, by definit=
ion, changing the bytes.=A0 If the bytes in there are not changed, then tha=
t integrity has not changed.

It is possible to mess with other things abou=
t a file (like its name, its suffix, or its ownership) but this does not ef=
fect the contents, and so would not affect that integrity, or the sound of =
the file (assuming you could read it at all after changing the ownership, o=
r the suffix, etc).

When you do your tests, if you cannot do a bit level c=
omparison, I would recommend at least checking the file sizes.=A0 If they a=
re identical, there is a very high probability that the content has not cha=
nged.

The problem I have i=

all=A0said that loss is possible. From

possible.
=A0
However, your=

But I will test it from my side. I will=

      Yes you can tell loss of quality by a bit-level 
        compari=
son.=A0 An audio file is just a file of bytes, that is later 
        inter=
preted by an audio player.=A0 Two files with the exact same

  identical, and so the sound (or the picture, etc) would be

Yes I did listen to the results, but that is not the

        opinion).=A0=
 The real test is compring the contents.=A0 Identical

It is

kind of compression that occurs 
                            during an emai=

le cleverly without losing 
                            information.=A0 For=
 example, if I had a program 
                            in some .exe file=
s, and I sent it over email, it 
                            could compress=
 it.=A0 But if it lost even one 
                            bit, the resul=
ting exe file would not execute again 
                            after it=
 was uncompressed on the other 
                            side.

This kin=
d of compression does things 
                            like looking for =
common patterns in the file, and 
                            replacing the=
m with a token.=A0 A rough example 
                            would be if=
 it found "Howdy Neighbor" in a file 20 
                            times,=
 it could replace all the occurances with say 
                            =
$HN1.=A0 And also write a little dictionary in 
                           =
 there someplace that says "$HN1=3DHowdy 
                            Neigh=
bor".

When the file gets to its 
                            destination i=
t can be uncompressed, and all 
                            occurences of $=
HN1 are replaced with "Howdy 
                            Neighbor".=A0 So =
it was compressed (instead of 14 
                            characters ea=
ch, it only needed 4, plus the 
                            dictionary), bu=
t lost no data.

Some formats,
