Hi

 

I am from delaware county paranormal in PA.

Yes - the rotation thi=
ng has been really working well for us, it is amazing to see people come ba=
ck wth the same names and experiences at the same location -it really build=
s a solid circumstantial case

Laurie,

 

I really do like that idea of ma=
pping out areas and then having the investigators rotate say after 40 minut=
es or so making sure that no one divulges information about their findings.=
 What we are looking for is for corrolations or repeat exeriences... BTW wh=
at group are you with?

YES!

 

W=
e have had cell phones set off our EMF meters.

What made me ban the use of=
 two way radios was when I noticed that they were causing interference on t=
he DVRs..

they also cause humming and static on some audio recorders - as =
do some cell phones.

 

 

For large aeas like Gettysburg, ffort Mifflin, =
ESP, etc, what we do is map out the area ahead of time, with a scheduled ro=
tation of small groups. That way we know where everyone is at all times. So=
 far this has been successful for us. This method assumes a level of respon=
sibility and respect on the part of the investigators - I have found that i=
f you are doing an event where others and the public are invited it is esse=
ntial to have them see the schedule and agree to abide by it when they sign=
 up and then again when they arrive.

Tom, 

 

I own a Motorola Razor. On a=
 recent investigation I had my Razor set to vibrate. I recieved a phone cal=
l that set off the EMF detector and it subsequently "spiked" from the color=
 green to red and did so for each vibra signal the the phone was receiving.=
.. This false positive reading led me to make sure that everyones phone was=
 instead turned off entirely.

 

I have also recieved radio interference o=
r bleed over from other two-way radios in the area that can be confused as =
EVP if not mentioned when recording audio. Still, I find 2-way radios conve=
nient if not necessary for larger scale field investigations. I'm sure my c=
olleagues in the Gettysburg area would agree with me ... but I also hear fr=
om my friend Bill Murphy that many have resorted to hand held GPS systems t=
o mark particular areas of interest when conducting EVP or ITC sessions in =
the field...
