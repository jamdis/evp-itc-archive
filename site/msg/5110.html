Bruce, I now have done a few days testing with my rs 690, evp maker, audacity, a mic, and my handheld digital recorder.  Nada, nothing, zilch.  Maybe because I only get to scan past 5 to 8 channels on Am or FM so I don't have enough signals to muster a response.  But from what you and others with experience seem to be saying, it shouldn't matter because I will get help from someone on the other-side.  Maybe they can't find me in Mexico?  Please let your techs know I am here...should be no problem with immigration papers or money exchange.  I really need help.  Ron L

That may be, But I find that when I do a session mike and lisa both come through but mike seems to be the more dominant one.
 
I have asked that mike and lisa help in your sessions as well as other new researchers and they seem to comply but I think mike
is more like a supervisor and delegates actions to other techs. I know that if you do not have a perminent tech that whatever tech
is available at the time you do your session will be assigned to assist you. If it is lisa she is very sweet and will do her best to give you 
solid communication. I'm glad she can help.

      I'm getting the thought that Lisa is bouncing around between us. She's very dominant every time I run a session and I've gotten some good stuff from her, which I will shortly be able to post, I hope. About a week ago, I got a really extraordinary sequence that ran something along the lines of a male saying, "Lisa, can you do it?" followed by a clear female voice saying, "Testing. Beginning. Ground," and then a second female voice saying "Kick." I was floored.

Anyway, Lisa seems to be the driver of a lot of what is going on right now. Maybe she intends to work with a number of us?

Ann

        Frank,
 
I have two techs that I speak with on a daily basis and one of them
is Lisa. She could possibly be contacting you with the technical info she tried to give me
yesterday.

      I've been getting Lisa too, but so far not in any segments tranfered 
to the PC. Even tonight I heard her, but not while I was taping.
