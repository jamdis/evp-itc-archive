Hi Gang,
My name is John Marc Carr, president/founder of SEFGR, South East Florida Ghost Research. I organized this group in 1998, and have been in the research of Ghost and Paranormal happenings ever since. I'm the official paranormal researcher for the Stranahan House which is Fort Lauderdale's oldest and most haunted historical landmark. We have gotten many EVP's by use of digital recorder. There are 5 intelligent haunts that are in the house and one residual haunt outside of the house. Most of the evp work has been handled by me, but I have been teaching some of my member to work their own recordings.

I am totally fascinated by your use of the "Frank's Box". My congradulations to your success, Frank and those who use the box on the research that you've accomplished. In this, I'm also dissappointed by those who have used your box to make money or notority to gain fame by it. I won't mention names, to mention them will only give them more strength. 

We are currently trying to do the Radio Shack hack of the 12-469 and hope to be successful in this trial by error. Hoping that our work will produce something that we've been trying to accomplish like you all have, two way communication with astral beings. It's fustrating to do digital recordings and having to wait and sift through the recordings to get information. We hope to elliminate that with the hack.

Are Frank's boxes available for retail? I've heard of the Mini Box that is coming out soon and they are taking pre-orders for this product. Our group is small and we don't charge for our research at the historical landmarks that we do here in Fort Lauderdale, so we are looking for the best at the lowest route approach.

Our next project is a Historical Firehouse that is haunted by the ghost of Robert Leland Knight. There is a mystery on how he died, but legend goes that he fallen in a water puddle that was electricfied by a downed wire. He was a large man and a Golden Glove champ of Florida. It was his second week of working at the firestation and he didn't have his gear because it had to be ordered. There is some who think (psychics) that he might have been pushed out of the firetruck as a prank that went wrong.

This firehouse has had media play with the Sci-fi channel in a show called "Proof Positive". The firestation is becoming a museum, and is allowing us to spend the night in doing an investigation about Robert. There are some who believe that some of the haunt has to do with a hanging tree that was at the opposite corner of the Firestation. We are excited about doing an investigation of this Historical Landmark, but are cautious of the fact that there will be low level spirits/astral beings that might be present.

Frank, If you have the time to answer me, that will be great. Those who have the "Frank's box", if you can tell me how you obtained yours, that will be helpful also. I would be greatful for any help at this point.

Thanks for letting me listen in on all of your discoveries and successes.

Best Regards,
John Marc Carr
