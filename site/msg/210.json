I dont do this stuff to be accepted by anybody. I do it simply for the reason that one day I heard my mother speak to me, and it was over 10 years since she had died and since I had heard that voice talk to me. \n   \n  They can all think/do what they want, because I know I will certainly do just that myself LOL. For those who choose to ignore it like hubby, well good for them and I will try not to burst thier bubble too often. \n   \n  My mother doesnt like any of the methods much and refuses to show up for evpmaker stuff, but a few friends always show up to give it a try no matter what method I choose including video. You&#39;ve seen/heard them. She was a very quiet person in life...they were not LOL\n   \n  As always Jody just keep track of the things that work best while ya try out something new. The radio one doesnt always work for me, it just recently started getting results. They gave me some new numbers again the other day but I have no clue what its for as usual. If its important they will tell me clearer than they have so far or I will run across it somewhere. If I were you I would ask them what station or frequency to use using the old method, then hopefully they will give you one like they did me to try out. Or you can always surf channels.\n   \n  Misty\n\nJody Cupp &lt;bigrig309@...&gt; wrote:\n            Hi Misty,\n  Your I miss you file sounds like &quot;If I was new, you could not use this&quot;  So maybe it means your contacts must have experience to use this method??\n   \n  The other one sounds like &quot;see I&#39;m the divinest (sp?) of one&quot;\n   \n  Very cool.  I&#39;ll have to check that method out. I&#39;ve done something similar with AM in between channels, that seemed to work well, but they warned me that it may not be accepted by the others.

I am using a pc tv/fm card without the fm antenna hooked up. I watch tv on my pc sometimes and it has radio. There are friends there who loved using the computer so they are always talking about it and what I need to do with it. Some of the things I have tried and it worked, some I havent gotten around to yet. This was one they mentioned and I tried but the results werent astounding me until recently.\n   \n  I still bounce back to the old &quot;water&quot; method and use it along with the radio. I asked them if anyone could use this method and the results were varied. I guess it depends on who the person is. For instance I had one voice say clearly &quot;it really works&quot;, then once I saved it and played it back it had changed to &quot;it didnt work&quot;. But heres one answer that didnt change so perhaps you can hear this one. I&#39;ll also add the it really works one for you to see what you hear on your end. If you hear it really works maybe you can use this method easily.\n   \n  Misty\n\nJody Cupp &lt;bigrig309@...&gt; wrote:\n        Wow very cool, I can hear them but a bit different then you.
