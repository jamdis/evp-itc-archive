Frank,  Can you tell me exactly how you know that you are making contact with the planets,  which one in particular?  I am not being facetious,  not at all,  I would really like to know.  I do not have a box,  any box.  Some time ago I enquired as to obtaining one but I think you didn't feel I was serious.  I am,  very much so.  Your reply would be most appreciated.  Thank you.     --Rod

Maybe the level that contains Telsa and Edison have been opened?

some of these messages that are delivered have to be looked at from a 
different angle). Correct me if I am wrong (which I probably am) but 
don't these different boxes use different frequencies for example (am 
vs fm). Telsa was believe one worked better for long distances and 
just maybe that is the message in which is trying to be conveyed??? 
That one may actually receive better transmission. Telsa also 
believe that he could in fact contact Mars and Venus (which proved to 
be stars? (if I am correct). In any event. I think that you need to 
analyze the parties involved and apply them to which is actually 
going on now at this period of time.
