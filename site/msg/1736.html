<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Wow, that&#x27;s a lot of info to think about.  I thought i was alone 
with this.  When i first started i had asked for a sign that i was 
actually speaking to someone and my ceiling fan stopped for a few 
seconds and than started again.  The next day it wouldn&#x27;t work at 
all, so i pulled the switch out of the wall and it was completely 
fried.  I luckily had a spare and re-installed it and it works fine 
again, but lesson was learned from that.  Don&#x27;t ask for a sign b 
ecause you never know what they will do, and that goes for with or 
without a box.  They do listen and will pull energy from anywhere 
they can to achieve it.  I think that explains the appliances going 
out, i will ask a question and right before they answer something in 
the house will flicker or go out.  Sometimes they say &quot;I did that&quot; 
to take credit for shutting something off.  It&#x27;s all about energy 
and how we use it in life and in death.

&gt; I never paid much attention as to which boxes produced more 
negatives, but I 
&gt; used to get alot when I first started this stuff. I tend to ignore 
those, 
&gt; and sometimes if it&#x27;s in a segment I copy to the computer I&#x27;ll 
play it 
&gt; backward. Reversed, sometimes the evil voices are angelic.  That&#x27;s 
curious 
&gt; about it shutting off aplliances, I thought those ran on internal 
batteries. 
&gt; Maybe you&#x27;re getting a lesson in energies?
&gt; 
&gt; I did get a quake warning in last nights test, it said  China 
suffers a 
&gt; quake, followed by August 11. I usually don&#x27;t get dates, or 
locations, so I 
&gt; guess wait any see, of maybe they can evacuate China? Often, when 
a quake is 
&gt; coming I get a wolf image, well there&#x27;s a wolf face on the shower 
window, 
&gt; kind of a medium size wolf, so I think if there is a quake it 
won&#x27;t be real 
&gt; severe, maybe like a 6 or 7. Wolves for quakes, cats for wind, and 
bears for 
&gt; tsunamis, which I didn&#x27;t know ahead of time. For Katrina I had a 
cat(image) 
&gt; with huge round eyes.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Does anybody think it&#x27;s possible to get 2 extreme opposites in
&gt; &gt;communication?  1 Box curses at me constantly and tells me to die 
and
&gt; &gt;also talks about the end of the world and hell.  And the other one
&gt; &gt;talks about how pretty it is there and i always get &quot;Hi&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt;Here&quot; as well as &quot;Don&#x27;t leave&quot; when i&#x27;m signing off and an
&gt; &gt;occasional &quot;Goodbye&quot;.  Has anyone experienced anything like this
&gt; &gt;before?  The 1 box even shuts off appliances in my house when i 
use
&gt; &gt;it, i guess i&#x27;ll stop using that one for now until i figure out a
&gt; &gt;solution to what&#x27;s going on.  Any ideas?????
