<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, must be. I guess they&#x27;re as taken with that little dog as the rest of 
us. He&#x27;s uspposed to be my wife&#x27;s dog, and she was wondering what to name 
him. Winston just popped into my head, and out my my mouth, and it stuck.

&gt;of evp&#x27;s i emailed to you privately that were for you.

&gt;that makes me say to myself, wait a minute, maybe there&#x27;s nothing to this
&gt;stuff, it&#x27;s all percption. I think it&#x27;s important to question all the
&gt;&quot;truths&quot;, all the time. BTW, Winston is our newest Yorkie, weighing in at a
&gt;whopping 2.5 pounds! Not a small dog, a tiny dog! Like a Pixie dog!?
&gt;
&gt;I know there&#x27;s somethig to the voices, but it&#x27;s hard to prove something, or
&gt;even demonstrate it if it&#x27;s highly, highly, highly, highly, highly,
&gt;highly---subjective, and personal?
&gt;
&gt;Oh yeah, another first, I never got my son through the box, I had a voice I
&gt;found last night &quot;Frankie------I&#x27;m here&quot;, and at least it sounded real.
