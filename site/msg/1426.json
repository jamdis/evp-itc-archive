I&#39;ve looked over some of the files and I see you&#39;ve improved\n&gt;things along the line.  I probably have most of the parts for these in my\n&gt;&quot;junquebox&quot; but need to order a few things.  It should be a very\n&gt;interesting project!\n&gt;\n&gt;Zack\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDon���t miss your chance to WIN $10,000 and other great prizes from Microsoft \nOffice Live http://clk.atdmt.com/MRT/go/aub0540003042mrt/direct/01/"}
