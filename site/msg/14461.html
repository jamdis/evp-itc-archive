Okay I have another one for you to think about.. I tape a session and review
it later..  even a day later.  Upon review the message that comes over is
about something that 'just happened' while I was reviewing or happened after
taping?  Is it possible that spirit can manipulate the recording AFTER
recording has stopped or even manipulate the audio while reviewing?

 

An give you an example of this I was recording one day and I reviewed the
audio the next day.  While reviewing - about half way through - the message
"Your mother is calling" was found.  I saved it and moved on and within two
seconds my mom called.  You say it is a coincidence except that I hadn't
spoken to my mother in over a year.  During this same conversation with her
- we sorta made amends and I told her the story of the 'secret' I had found
out about a family member having a child out of wedlock in the late 1920s.
Quick backstory.. I found out about this out-of-wedlock birth through my
genealogy research and contacted spirit through the box and I was promptly
told to keep it secret and which I promised to do.

 

Well in this conversation with my mom after not speaking for a year I told
her what I had found out.  When the telephone conversation ended with my
mom. I was amazed that the recording had told me she would call right be
fore she did - even though the audio was recorded the previous day.  I
proceeded to go back to reviewing the audio and the very first thing I heard
was:  THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SECRET - YOU LIED.

 

Maybe they can manipulate 'real-time' literally????

2 different things happening-that's why. When you get EVP that everyone
understands, it is outward, in the environment. Not a communication through
subconscious means.

 

EVP that people swear they hear, but noone else can make sense, may be a
message to them via subconscious means. That isn't to say that ALL EVP's
like this are true messages, I am sure alot are just matrixing.

 

But then that is how the art of scrying starts-matrixing. Like the Rorschach
tests. The images you matrix with those gives the psychologist an insight
into your mind.

 

By gazing into a dark, reflective surface, you start to see cloudy images.
At first, you will just be matrixing faces in the clouds and not getting
much substance. Try it, you will see what I am saying. With practice, you
start to see clear, concise images.

 

I think that is what happening with audio as well.

 

We already know for a fact pareidolia can occur in audio as well as visual
stimulus.

yes I understand its personal to that particular individual but why can't I
hear it.  I have gotten some very personal EVPs through the traditional
investigation way (not through a box or anything of that matter) that all
others have heard.

I don't know for sure about that one either, but I am not ready to discount
it either, especially since I stumbled across the possibility of audible
scrying. But I am sure alot of people don't believe in scrying at all
either.

 

What makes it a possibility to me is that so many people are hearing things
that are very personal, but stuff they would not have come up with on their
own.

I think that is the problem I am having though Jim.  When you say "work them
over till you hear them"  to me I should not have to work them over till I
hear them.  Yes taking out the ambient and background noise is one thing.
But if you just keep on listening to them with different enhancements you
are bound to hear something (matrixing).  If one person is not meant to hear
it they won't hear it (I guess I am not quite ready to believe that one
right yet).  I think you all know what I am getting at.

there to begin with "you have done no harm" I hear alot more than others I

statement, but if you are able to clean it up with better software (please
do for others too) I will be more than happy to "listen" where I made a
mistake...I can only LEARN from it :) I have done some DEEP enhancements to
a few of my evp's...from the begining I could only hear clicks and
thumps.....but after messing with that area, eventually I would hear the
true voices (and can tell if male or female...approximate age) and
understand the mood also....these where extreamly modified, and I feel that
I could NOT have added enough "simple" enhancements that would ADD a
voice....full of emotion and distinct syllables :) And some just can't hear
them for what ever reason be it equipment that is used to hear
(pc-headphones-speakers-ears) know one has the perfect match of all these
things. Check out "Jim's RR-DR60 EVP's" in the files section....work them
over till you hear them. I really can't do much more :)--- In
