<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>How very interesting! Although there have been studies of the psychic 
conections between twin, I haven&#x27;t heard of any that use some of the 
equipment that Box or evp research uses. I don&#x27;t know if your 
intention is to employ some of the gear we do, but it sounds 
intriguing. 

I do know a person who had a maternal twin that suddenly lost her 
life, and her sibling was aware of it before being contacted by other 
family members with the news. The surviving twin reported that there 
was no fright involved at the moment of passing, it was just a 
transition to another form of existence. -Bill

&gt; I would like to propose a subject for some research sessions.
&gt; It involves Identical twins and the spiritual and mental connection 
&gt; that they share.
&gt; 
&gt; The way identical twins are conceived is when the egg enters the 
womb 
&gt; for some reason it splits into two separate eggs. The resulting two 
&gt; fetuses develop independently of each other, but carry the same 
&gt; genetic
&gt; code and identical DNA. they are in essence clones of each other.
&gt; 
&gt; some cases of identical twins that where separated at birth for 
&gt; whatever reason, and then have been reunited later in life find 
that 
&gt; they have developed similar if not identical traits and habits, 
such 
&gt; as an interest in art or the same music or literature. They also 
&gt; share common memory patterns that are impossible to develop other 
&gt; than through some sort of telekinetic link. Being separated at 
birth 
&gt; they could not have experienced any joint memories. There have even 
&gt; been cases where one twin will become gravelly ill pr have a 
serious 
&gt; accident and the other will to a certain extent feel the pain and 
&gt; suffering of the other twin.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This raises a few questions that might be a good research subject 
for 
&gt; us to pursue.
&gt; 
&gt; Is the relationship that we build with our technician/guides 
similar 
&gt; in content as the subconsious or spiritual bond between twins?
&gt; 
&gt; When the egg separates in the womb do the individual twins share a 
&gt; single spirit or soul?
&gt; 
&gt; Does the soul get divided as well to serve both individuals in the 
&gt; physical and then reunite as one entity after death.
&gt; 
&gt; Most likely one twin will die before the other, when the second 
twin 
&gt; passes is the spirit of the second twin absorbed into the first and 
&gt; vice verse?
&gt; 
&gt; Does each twin receive it&#x27;s own unique spirit and if so does the 
&gt; spiritual energy remain identical the same as the twins DNA and 
&gt; physical characteristics?
&gt; 
&gt; These are just a few of the possibilities we could explore with 
this 
&gt; subject.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone is interested please contact me so we can discuss it.
