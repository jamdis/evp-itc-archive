LOL well perhaps its just the added email that bug some. But I think sharing is what the forum is about so cant fault anyone for that. For those who dont want the shares just switch from individual email to daily digests or no email or whatever. 
   
  You guys really do have to start using mp3 versions tho we are at 90% full again so its going to come down to either some people wont be allowed to post files if they cant make the transition, or all files will have to be deleted, or nobody will be able to post at all because there will be no space left. 
   
  Many of you have already begun preperation and convert your files into smaller formats and make use of places like esnips to post the larger files on. 
   
  I am glad to see the renewed interest in Stefans evpmaker. It's been used for a long time and by many reputable researchers here as well as other countries/languages as a source for background sound they can modulate. Frank S has had some great results with it over the years and so have I. It's one of many methods available that can be used as a tool. 
   
  The United States is actually far behind in ITC research but recently has been picking up speed in leaps and bounds. That is thanks to everyone here who continues thier research and sharing with others.

  Keep up the good work! If we run out of space then we will just improvise =) The research will not end due to some technical difficulties.

I know everybody including myself says"oh no not another 10 files to 
listen too" but I think these files from this new method are worth the 
effort.

Give a listen and lets start getting some opinions on this new EVPM 
method.
