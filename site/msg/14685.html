<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Silver is the best conductor known, with a conductivity of 63.01 E06 Siemens
per meter. Copper is next best at 59.6 E06 S/m. Gold is not the best, at
45.2 E06 S/m. Aluminum is much farther down, at 37.8 E06 S/m.

Silver and gold are expensive. They are usually used to plate RF assemblies
where the skin effect takes place (current doesn&#x27;t flow uniformly through a
conductor at RF frequencies but mainly travels at the surface of the
conductor). Gold has the advantage that it never tarnishes or corrodes with
most things it is exposed to. It&#x27;s used a lot in contacts for rotary
switches and relays.

&gt;    Firrst Electrical job I was on as a helper in 1976 was to pick up a
&gt; pole that was to feeding a house someone had wired in aluminum that had
&gt; burned to the ground due to a bad connection it had just been built. I had
&gt; been with my old man on a many job sinhce I was 8 and never had seen
&gt; anything like that. Copper is the only way to gold only better conductor is
&gt; Gold. but who can handle that in a house. worste case of emf I have ever
&gt; seen was a fancy chandaler that someone had over sized bulbs in and that
&gt; thing flared up the whole house to very dangerous levels. when they say 60
&gt; watt max they mean it for your own safety. this thing had around 10 100 watt
&gt; bulbs in it and the emfs were causing all kinds of nice images after 30
&gt; minutes in the house we were having them too.

&gt;  Aluminum wire is a nightmare! The stuff tends to overheat, oxidizes where
&gt; interconnections are made and will spark, etc.
&gt;
&gt; I bought a transformer at Gateway Electronics in St. Louis some years ago
&gt; that looked like a great transformer for a high-current 12 volt supply. The
&gt; secondary appeared to be wound with #8 enameled wire. I found out the
&gt; secondary was wound with aluminum wire. After I built the power supply and
&gt; tried to get 20 amps from it but couldn&#x27;t, I gave up on it and got another
&gt; transformer wound with copper wire.

&gt;&gt;   We have a touch lamp that comes on by itself, and we have electric
&gt;&gt; matress heaters that make a clicking noise in the radio when the controller
&gt;&gt; is on. When the furnace comes on, it affects the boxes, and--when I first
&gt;&gt; started doign EVP recordings with white noise, if the furnace happened to
&gt;&gt; come on when I was recording a voice would report &quot;it&#x27;s on fire!&quot;.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  What if that house has aluminum wire?

&gt;&gt;&gt;     Yes.  Also faulty wiring, which is even more dangerous.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Also with flakey transformers or other power distribution in the area, or
&gt;&gt;&gt; power lines.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps you can check with some neighbors, and see how their power is
&gt;&gt;&gt; doing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;   Hi All,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there someone here that can answer and electrical question for me?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; During the case that I recorded those possible EVP&#x27;s-there was a loud
&gt;&gt;&gt; tapping noise that seemed to come from the 2nd bedroom. Upon checking my
&gt;&gt;&gt; logs, every time one of  these clicks were heard, there would be an EMF
&gt;&gt;&gt; spike in the livingroom. The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the livingroom
&gt;&gt;&gt; downstairs. The home owners have also reported that they have a touch lamp
&gt;&gt;&gt; that comes on all the time by itself and the lights in the Kitchen will dim
&gt;&gt;&gt; occasionally.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Now these taps are not consistent in timing, loudness or rhythm. Could
&gt;&gt;&gt; this be the work of faulty breakers?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks!
&gt;&gt;&gt; April
&gt;&gt;&gt;
