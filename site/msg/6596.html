<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, I tried to listen to your files and I can&#x27;t. Maybe it&#x27;s a Mac  
thing, but I cannot hear anything on esnips and never have been able  
to. Unless someone can tell me why and help me overcome what is an  
absolutely shocking technical ignorance on my part, I can&#x27;t hear  
nothin&#x27;!

&gt; I agree with you 100% but lets be democratic and give the esnips  
&gt; method a try.
&gt; I suggest after 1 month evaluate what members think about it and  
&gt; decide what to do from there.

&gt;
&gt; Bruce,
&gt;             I have to agree with you.  Given the file folder  
&gt; shortage, I deleted all of my files to give the new comers room.  I  
&gt; hated to do that, given if anyone wanted to revert back to my  
&gt; clips, they could in fact do so and now that can&#x27;t.   I also hate  
&gt; to have to send someone a link to find my audio on an additional  
&gt; sight.
&gt;
&gt;             Maybe we could comprise and say after &quot;x&quot; amount of  
&gt; days, upon new files being uploaded we could clean house?  I know  
&gt; that not everyone will take it upon themselves to do this, but if  
&gt; they don&#x27;t (after an announcement from the groups caretakers), if  
&gt; they disappear, its their own fault.
&gt;
&gt;              I personally like the single emails announcing each  
&gt; file.  I can go straight to the audio clip and not have to search  
&gt; through previous clips I have already listened to.
&gt;
&gt; Just my thoughts!

&gt; Yesterday I decided to post some files so I posted to a sub folder of
&gt; my main folder in the files section.
&gt; I noticed that some people voiced their dislike of sending post  
&gt; notices
&gt; for every file , so I sent none. Just a single post stating that I had
&gt; posted the files and where they could be found.
&gt;
&gt; Now this is the dilemma, If you do not post an announcement for each
&gt; file and you trust that the single post announcing all the files that
&gt; have been posted will suffice, well I don&#x27;t think so!
&gt;
&gt; I know that most individuals here do not listen to or reply to every
&gt; single file posted but I will usually get some comments on the better
&gt; or more interesting ones. So far from the posting yesterday &quot;NADA&quot;
&gt;
&gt; If anyone saw the post I wrote announcing the files I posted to the
&gt; files section, please for my own satisfaction let me know.
&gt;
&gt; Otherwise I don&#x27;t think the one post notice thing is gonna cut it!
