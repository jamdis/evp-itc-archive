<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That  sounds quite ominous, Zack. Not sure I like the sound of it.  
What is your theory?

&gt; We actually don&#x27;t know who we&#x27;re communicating with using the boxes. I
&gt; suspect it isn&#x27;t what we traditionally call a &quot;ghost&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; I also suspect that people are not hearing their loved ones. The loved
&gt; oneshave probably been elsewhere for some time ...

&gt; &gt; I personally have seen Chris use his box in public forum four times.
&gt; &gt; I have heard the box give audible yes and no type answers to peoples
&gt; &gt; questions. I do feel though that the ones that get emotionally moved
&gt; &gt; the most are the ones wanting with all their heart to hear from a
&gt; &gt; loved one. When these people get an answer that may or may not be
&gt; &gt; heard by all, they feel that it is indeed from a loved one and it
&gt; &gt; hits them in the heart as if it was real. I would love to hear a
&gt; &gt; recorded session from start to finish as an investigator. After all
&gt; &gt; this research is for all not just &quot;30&quot;.... :-)
