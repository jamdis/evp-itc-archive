<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am no expert or long-time experimenter in EVP-ITC - that is why I
ask questions.  As to your question as to my favorite method, it would
be the one that was developed and tested under the best  controlled
conditions possible, and has given the most reliable results. Given
that, I am still searching for a method I would say I like, since my
experience has been that the more controlled the experiment, the less
convincing the results.  Which is worrisome, as far as confirming the
theories in general go.

Did I answer your question, or did you have a comments on my observations?

Since you are one of the researchers, perhaps you can answer some of
the questions I asked in my previous post:

&quot;How did you go about that?  Did you do exactly five 30 second clips?
 Or did you do more, and send in just the best?&quot;

&gt; Iam just wondering how long you have been doing I.T.C/E.V.P research 
&gt; and analasis Iam one of the 8 researchers Mike asked to help him in his 
&gt; project. The files he posted are his own. As for my files I am still 
&gt; working on them and after I send them to Mike and he is ok with me 
&gt; sharing them I have no problem posting them or sending them to you. I 
&gt; would be very interested in your opinion. On the other hand I have many 
&gt; files you may find interesting I am currently working on putting them 
&gt; up on esnips http://www.esnips.com/web/nightparanormalresearchsStuff
&gt; thats the link to a couple and theres more to come in the future. enjoy
&gt; back to my original question how long have you been involved with I.T.C 
&gt; and what is your favorite method of capturing I.T.C.
