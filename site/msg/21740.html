Who, me? I'm  a writer, not a rocket scientist. LOL
I'm not going to brag a=
bout knowledge I don't have, but if you're
referring to me, I was just joki=
ng around (exaggerating my lack of
knowledge about the intricate workings o=
f a radio). I know the basic
terms, but I don't know most of the terminolog=
y. I"m very intelligent
and well-read, actually. I've known about Tesla sin=
ce I was 13 (about 30
years ago). I just don't have an engineering degree. =
Where'd you get
yours? LOL ;)
It's ok. No offense taken.

If you can make out some of the technical stuff, i'd love to hear
what it i=
s. I think we need improvements all the time with the boxes. I
used a Sange=
an dt200x as the tuner for this box.
