I think if you=A0"believe" you need to do it then do it, or you will believ=
e you are unprotected. On the other hand if you have no fear then you dont =
give others the power to scare you or intimidate you. In the end do what wo=
rks best for you.

Yeah, I totally agree about reinforcing fears. Like, t=

 anyone did the protection thing and still had negative stuff come through.=
