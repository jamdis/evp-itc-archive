<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>So if you&#x27;re not Christian, you have all the time in the world?

 Yeah, I get some saying it&#x27;s this month, or next month, or August, or October. I&#x27;ll stick with December 2012, and even that I&#x27;m not taking to the bank.

 FYI, rapture ain&#x27;t in the bible. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be stuck in/with this body --forever--wrong frikin&#x27; gender! And species.

&gt; Great file Frank!  Says, &quot;time on earth&quot; then a different person says,  &quot;is 
&gt; it?&quot;  They are talking about the limited time we are going to be here  now, 
&gt; if you are Christian and believe, you will be taken up, body and all,  
&gt; believers will be the only ones that see Him in the sky, our physical body will  
&gt; be changed, and it won&#x27;t hurt, the sensation will fell like when someone  
&gt; stretches, the adrenalin will kick in, we disappear to others around us, and 
&gt; up  we go!  I am told it will be soon now, all I got to say is,   Yikes!  sf

&gt; Yeah, just listen to the music. This is from a couple days ago  using that

&gt; frags, but &quot;they&quot; did the assembling!
