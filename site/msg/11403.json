I am learning so much and so eager to get \nstarted with my own experiments :) \n\n\n-- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kristin Morris&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; To Angela - I have very poor reception and have gotten discouraged \nmore than once to say the least.  I have asked them for advice and I \nclearly received a message that stated I should meditate to help my \nconnection.  When I do take the time to meditate before a session it \ndoes seem to be a better signal. I even asked them right after I \nmeditate if it helped and they responded that yes indeed it helped.  Of \ncourse I am horrible at meditating and I haven&#39;t taken to the process \nvery well :-)  I&#39;ll post my clips of them telling me to mediate.  Look \nin Kristin&#39;s File.\n&gt;"}
