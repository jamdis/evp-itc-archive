&gt;  A couple voices from just now testign another car tuner. I have 
veryu few of these, and out of four I had in the junk box, only two 
work. These are weak, almost like regular EVP. Rigel is one that 
comes through every once in awhile, not sure if that his name, or 
home, as sometimes he says &quot;this is your friend from Rigel&quot;
&gt;  
&gt;  It&#x27;s still looking like the sound chamber is completely un needed, 
and may even hamper the voices. What I get form the Ghostman, and 
even directly from a tuenr module is easier to understand that the 
ones through an sound chamber and mic amplifiers. the Gostman in 
direct mode yields longs, and more coherent voices than the original 
box, at least compared to what I was getting last night.
&gt; Tonight I&#x27;ll modifiy #32 to get either direct recordings out of the 
tuner, or through the sound chamber so I can compare.  I had one from 
2/5/08 from the Ghostman that said &quot;that Earthquake will occur-------
on the island near Chile (Falklands?).  There was a EQ today off 
Brazil, but no island there.
