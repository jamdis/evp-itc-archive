If you do contact him can you tell him that \nRees will be asking to speak with them tonight around 7-8pm eastern \ntime. To see if they can contact me. They lived a long and \nwonderful life together. So all my family is sad to see him go, but \nwe know it was his time to leave, and life goes on. He should be \nhappy to be back with his wife. (He was 83 years old) I know \nprobaly somebody here might think this is crazy, dumb or \ndisrespectful, but that is my business. I think it should be easy to \nget in contact with him since he just crossed over. Please let me \nknow if you tried and any evidence you might get from him.\n\nThanks\n\nWilliam Rees\n\n\n\n                           \n\n\nMichael Edwards:  f1cracker75@...\n       \n---------------------------------\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
