It would have to present consistent results first. Then I would trust it...=
to a point. I could never be 100% sure and that is fine by me.

So in the e=
nd, it really doesn't matter. I would be happy just knowing that I have pro=
ven to myself that I am conversing with a sentient being.

  I would try it both ways -solo and with another person. However I wou=

    Well, if my husband would l=
et me actually experiment with one, that would be the first step LOL!

    =
But what I would try and do is get some kind of verifiable information from=
 the "entity" that I contact with the board to prove that it is communicati=
on from an actual, intelligent being and not just my own motor responses ma=
king he planchette move. It would have to be information that I have no kno=
wledge of.

    If I could do that, and consistently, then I would be comfo=
rtable saying that I am actually talking to a spirit.

    The reason I hav=
e my doubts is that you have to be touching the planchette to get it to mov=
e. If it were an actual spirit, I would think that shouldn't be necessary. =
We all know ghosts can a do move objects.

    But this brings up another m=
ystery - if the Ouija board is actual spirit communication, maybe there is =
a difference between the entities you can contact with it and your common g=
host.

      .


      When it comes to =
the Ouija, I just want to study it to find out if it is really spirit commu=
nication, or just kinetic energy or your subconscious mind moving the planc=
hette.

      I agree that we all have the ability for extra sensory percep=
tion, just some are better at it than others. Like running, for instance. W=
e all can run, but some are naturally better at it. Still, with practice we=
 can get better.

      But that is not my aim with the Ouija.

        You forgot yawn from boredom, that's what I do.

        Use it, don't use it.  I don't care.  But why bother.  Whe=

 whatever why not develop the ability yourself.  - ya, I'm one of those who=

        There's always the question in the b=
ack of your mind whether your partner's moving it.  The intentions of "what=
" you are talking to.  Not to mention it's too slow and limited.
         
=
        Besides if you take the time to develop the ability you can get mor=
e texture in the information.  Asking the board "where you married?" may ge=
t you a "yes" but a psychic might get the sense of a religious or civil cer=
emonhy, the garment(s) worn, other's in the party, or whether that Being ap=
