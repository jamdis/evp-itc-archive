<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I hear all the pieces, too, Frank, and they do seem to be related.  
But the message isn&#x27;t clear enough to really understand. I&#x27;m racking  
my brain trying to recall something I told you that might shed some  
light--wait--it says that I told *them.*

My inclination is that this has something to do with Debbie at www. 
1800heaven.com. She got into this because of grief over the loss of  
her son, Joey, and recently she has been experimenting with a minibox  
for the first time.

&gt; the rythum of the recording, and mentally seperate out the gibberish.
