Thanks Bruce, I was wandering how others do it.  I'll show them the same respect if not more than regular people.  Mostly regular people I know will F*ck you before the dead would.  Anybody that shows me respect, I'll show them respect back.

          wiliam,
 
I close an EVPM session the same way I close any communication, minus the request to return any wayward spirits.
 
I thank my spirit friends for their effort and attention and let them know that I am about to end the session and 
I will speak with them again soon. I say goodbye and turn off my equipment.
 
My philosophy with spirit people is the same as with people here in the physical. 
Treat others as you yourself would wish to be treated. Do that and you can never go wrong.

      On your evp sessions how do you close the session, its a little different than a box session?  I pretty sure that your not opening a portal.
