Frank,
 
This only becomes an issue when new people get interested in our =
research and seek information from the usual paranormal community and are m=
et with these type of answers and explanations. They quickly become disinte=
rested and whenever anyone may mention box research in the future they conv=
ey the same closed minded ignorance that was spewed to them on their initia=
l quest for answers.
 
Not to mention that anyone that does any serious res=
earch in this medium would I'm sure like to have their efforts recognised a=
s being legitimate in their source and taken seriously with respect. not  d=
ismissed as nonsense or something that is written off as fake or delusional=
. 
 
Frank I don't want to start a long thread with all different people sn=
iping back and forth I posted that snip it of a blog to let everyone know w=
hat the general consensus of our research is. And I did not even mention wh=
o the blog was actually about but I'm sure we all can guess. It's that kind=
 of stupidity that stops us from getting new potential researchers involved=
 and adding their positive energy to our own, I have received messages from=
 our friends on the other side that instruct that the more individuals that=
 are involved and think positively about the communication we are striving =
to achieve, the stronger the communication will get. I view this blog attit=
ude as not a personal attack on what I am particularly doing but just anoth=
er extremely large hurtle to get over in bringing this amazing form of spir=
it communication to the forefront of paranormal research.

t comes to mind about this whole 'box' thing is what are the chances that s=

the am or fm bands seems very unlikely. Bruce
