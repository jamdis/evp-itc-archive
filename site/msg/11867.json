A large percentage of the time, mediums information is in  \nerror. I&#39;m not saying that mediums can&#39;t be of assistance, but I&#39;d not  \nbase fact on their &quot;abilities&quot;.\n\nSince this list is for the research of EVP & ITC, I tend to give  \ncredit to what I can hear/record via various equipment, my own  \nexperiences, physics, and other solid data, not simply what I&#39;m told  \nvia others. Those combined with my own experiences in recording is  \nwhat holds water in my opinion. Spiritualism, in my opinion, in this  \narea of research, would be considered by the scientific community as  \nheresay as well as lacking in the area of burden of proof. I simply  \nrefuse (myself) to base my own beliefs on what others say, but strive  \nto prove what I experience via what others can hear/see... solid  \nevidence - not heresay that I don&#39;t agree with for various reasons  \nalready stated in earlier posts.\n\nw.\nOn Aug 18, 2008, at 8:17 AM, threadsintyme@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Spiritualism.
