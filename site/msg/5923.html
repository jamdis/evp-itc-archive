Very good observation Babs. Let me say that you have many friends and associates here just for the simple fact that you have an interest in ITC, are a researcher and a complex thinker. I think we have shown in the past that we can have a disagreement and still remain friends. You make a lot of good points in your post and I would like to know who removes time from their recordings. I have never removed time from my recordings and see no reason why anyone else would without saying so in an accompanied post.

I have limited experience with the 12-469's as a single piece of equipment. I have arranged mine per Mike's, "Spiricomp" design. I have 3, 12-469's feeding a four channel mixer, which goes into a laptop running DC6 with Soundsoap 2. Mine scan equally spaced on the FM band. I have had pretty good results until recently.

At first the messages were pretty clear but I had a feeling I was getting a different group than I normally have for the last few years. When I would ask about my friends on the other side they would tell me they will look for them. Well about 2 weeks ago the 12-469 arrangement started generating a lot of interference and feedback. I started hearing radio static voices as I use to get with shortwave. Not voice fragments but voices made of static (metallic and robotic). They were breaking through the sweeping. I had a feeling someone else was trying to force their way through. Finally the interference got so bad I was forced to revert back to a simpler method I used before, which is using fan noise. One of the first messages to come across was from a familiar voice telling me and I quote, "your method sucks". I have not used the 12-469's since because of the clear messages I have been getting using water and fan noise. That does not mean I have given up
 on the 12-469's but I won't use them again until I am persuaded to by my friends on the otherside that they are willing to use and adapt to it. To my knowledge only Misty, Laura and myself use water for recording.

Regards,

Frank R.

            Alright, you all know I'm vocal and I haven't made any "friends" here

but, if we can put that aside for a moment...



Spirit communication has been my passion since day one, a little over

6 years ago. I am a believer in the afterlife and a believer in

spirits attempting to communicate with us for a variety of reasons. I

have spiritual beliefs that I feel strongly about and devote much of

my waking (and sleeping) moments to thoughts about this field.

However, I am also a researcher and a skeptic. In order for me to

allow ideas to become part of my reality I must experiment. In order

for me to believe something is paranormal I HAVE to rule out all other

possible causes. That being said, I have some questions. My hope is

that there are some here willing to enter into discussion with me.



I have a difficult time with many of the files here. Many times, there

is no question included in the file. I can not determine whether or

not the "reply" is an intelligent reply. Maybe this has to do with

allowable file size.



Some of the files I have been able to download. (I don't always keep

my email settings on for this group as I get too many - lol) When I

look at the file I see problems. There will be complete flat line

silence between the words. Many times the "reply" is also at the same

decibel as the question askers voice. Those two things should not

occur naturally considering the devices being used. That tells me that

there is manipulation of the files. Now, what is manipulation to me,

may not be manipulation to others. To me, any altering of the recorded

file constitutes manipulation. I do not know if the reply was

intelligent or manipulated to be intelligent. 



Some say that they simply remove the "no response" time. I've been

told it can be as much as 18 seconds removed from between words. Now

we run into the problem of us deciding what word fits in with the

question. What words are being ignored?  Did we take nonsense and make

sense? Did we amp every noise/word or only what fit?



I think it's great that files are offered for peer review. However, I

think we have to load them untouched or at the very least, offer

exactly what was done to the entire file. Time elapsed between words,

what was amped, etc. I'd also love to see some of these sessions video

taped with the question asker facing the camera and a second hand

clock visible. Truly, we aren't researching if we don't have some

protocol in place.



Here is an issue I have with the RS Hacks. I have the 469. It takes

approximately 18 seconds to scan through the AM frequencies. Now, the

typical person would think that we can take that 18 seconds and divide

it by the number of AM stations to determine how long we are on each

station before moving on to the next one. In that way we could

determine what is impossible to be said via a radio fragment. However,

that's not correct. The scan cycle can vary from one frequency to the

next and of course the biggest problem is that some stations are

picked up over multiple frequencies; AM 640 can be heard on 630, 640,

650, 660 and maybe even 670. That extends the time a great deal. This

is a difficult problem because it is almost impossible for the average

person to be able to make a determination on time this way. 



I heard about the following today; An experimenter records at the same

time every day Mon-Fri. We hear about the importance of meditating,

automatic writing, etc at the same time every day but what we have to

remember with this, is that now we are in essence tuning into the same

radio show every day. One of my first experiments with the 469 had me

hearing this deep male voice over and over again. What was he trying

to tell me, I wondered. Than I realized that he was speaking

approximately every 18 seconds; every time the scan hit that station.

So, if you are removing up to 18 seconds between words, then you are

really only recording the words from one station. 



This post is IN NO WAY trying to start anything besides discussion

about some research problems. I know that there are those who are not

concerned with anything more than the communication itself but I think

that it is of the utmost importance to attempt to factor in some

protocol in order for this to be considered serious research at all.
