Hi to all and welcome to the new members joining us. I have a few things to share and since I am short on time (as usual) I am just going to do an all in one post LOL
   
  So here are a few evp and the new ITC images can be found in the "NEW" gallery at the end.
   
  http://webcamitc.myphotoalbum.com/
   
  The evp are attached to this post. For those of you who do not get the attached files you will have to set your group settings to "individual emails" to allow the file attachments to get thru from each group member.
   
  There were 51 messages in my last sessions...way to much to post here so I am just posting a few sound files and including the "child" messages because there was a child who came thru in my video works last sessions and I complained I couldnt see his face so perhaps its the little "cowboy" again finally letting me see his face good. See image blocks 122106ncowboy and 122806j series.

  There were other messages, louder and clearer including a few about a friends work he is doing (in this field). I will try and post some of those later when I have more time.
   
  Misty
