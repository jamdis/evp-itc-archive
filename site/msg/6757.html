<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ron,

When I ran a group (5 of us) session two weeks ago, I had members of 
the group formulate questions and I did the asking for about an 8 
minute session or so.  They could not hear the responses aloud, as I 
had the audio piped directly into a mixer, then outputted to the 
recorder (but I could hear &amp; had on headphones to listen in).

I immediately then uploaded the audio to my laptop, and began playing 
the audio aloud, allowing the group to help me analyze what we had 
captured.  We received great messages that were not lower level, but 
sentences of information (not just &quot;hi,&quot; &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; etc).  

So, I would like to add to this discussion that group sessions can 
work well, but it may depend on how you do it and what the intentions 
are.

&gt; Hi Steve   Just to jump in with a friendly point of view.  I was 
really appreciative of you providing the videos on the boxes.  One 
reason for my excitement is because I wanted to see the new RS 125 
that I have ordered.  The other reason was because I want to 
introduce a techie type friend to this whole phenomena and I thought 
your presentation would be a good starting point.   After watching 
your video you satisfied my first interest, but I chose not to refer 
my friend to the video.   I found the video to be very interesting 
and I was only a little disappointed that responses to your questions 
did not come across to my ear.  But I could only imagine how a newbie 
like my friend would react.  Even though he is a techie, I think he 
would have wanted to HEAR something from the other side.  I felt that 
someone who did not previously know about the successful sessions 
that so many researchers have had here, would have experienced a guy 
talking to himself or, worse yet, asking
&gt;  questions to a radio and then answering himself.  Again, I think 
someone who takes the time to see such a presentation also wants to 
see the results.  After all, getting a message from the other end is 
the purpose of what&#x27;s being done.  Audience expectations should not 
be underestimated.   Hope this helps.   Thanks again for the 
videos.   Ron L

&gt; I appreciate the concern, however i have learned from the past 
&gt; experience. I was going to go and do a brief background on my 
&gt; limited time so far in ITC and box research and maybe turn the 
&gt; different devices on for those to hear how each one sounds. I 
&gt; probably wasn&#x27;t going to ask questions due to the halloween event 
&gt; when i received no spiritual contacts, but that wasn&#x27;t a meeting 
&gt; either where i could explain what i was doing. I also am going to 
&gt; bring the 4 spare hacked 470 radios i have to offer to potential 
&gt; future researchers. Nothing is etched in stone yet with me going, i 
&gt; have to contact them first and see if that&#x27;s what they want. I was 
&gt; supposed to go in November, but declined because i wasn&#x27;t ready to 
&gt; display yet. Now, there is so many different radios out there that 
i 
&gt; can offer the idea for those who wish to approach this research 
with 
&gt; an open mind.

&gt; &gt; Steve,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I listened to the file, It could have said what is labeled.
&gt; &gt; It was kinda rough and I don&#x27;t think anyone but an experienced
&gt; &gt; researcher used to listening to Frank&#x27;s box would hear anything
&gt; &gt; from the random mode especially.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think you may have gotten caught up in the moment, I know those 
&gt; group sessions can get exciting.
&gt; &gt; My advice would be to hold off on any public display sessions 
until 
&gt; we refine the communivation to 
&gt; &gt; where the average listener is capable of hearing a response. 
Don&#x27;t 
&gt; forget what happened on halloween in staten Island.
&gt; &gt; Or what happened to those knuckle heads at pulse radio.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think it would be detrimental to the research not to go 
somewhere 
&gt; and have a group of people hear nothing but what 
&gt; &gt; they discern as noise. for the simple reason that they are not 
&gt; equiped to hear the actual responses.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Just my opinion as afriend and fellow researcher. also I believe 
&gt; our friend Frank believes that the box was not meant 
&gt; &gt; for field work and does not perform to the best of it&#x27;s ability 
in 
&gt; a public situation.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have been having weird sessions with Frank&#x27;s Box #27, but in a 
&gt; good way. They told me to change the antenna, which it did and the 
&gt; random started working and never has on this box. They told me 
&gt; tonight to put the old antenna back on and the sessions keep 
getting 
&gt; better and better. I dragged Juli and Joel in on what i believed 
and 
&gt; felt was going to be a great box session and here is a file only a 
&gt; couple minutes in to our hour long session. This is a bit rough 
&gt; sounding, but hearing it live is pretty clear and you can hear me 
&gt; respond and than Joel agrees that he heard it too. My sessions are 
&gt; pretty incredible since the random mode started working on the 
FB#27 
&gt; and i feel the random is the best thing out there...hands down. I 
&gt; have done Sessions on the internet through Skype all week and i 
feel 
&gt; the energy between Juli and I are really bringing them through 
&gt; clearly. I only use FB#27 now in random mode and it is the best 
&gt; feature on any box, between the white noise, echo and random there 
is 
&gt; no competetion up to this point. The hacks are good, but nothing is 
&gt; better than an original frank&#x27;s box. Our friends on the other side 
&gt; told me that they fixed the random mode to go and teach others and 
i 
&gt; am going to a meeting on wednesday to demonstrate the different 
boxes 
&gt; and our friend made a promise to come though if i go....so we will 
&gt; see.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here is one of the files i got so far.
