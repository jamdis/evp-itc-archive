Dr. Sam El-Khazen recently published an article in the\nJournal of  Neuroquantology (study of brain function at the quantum\nmechanical level).  In this paper entitled &quot;DNA The Gateway to\nTime&quot;, El-Khazen talks about the  relationship between the structure\nof DNA, time, conscious perception and  gravity. There is credible\nevidence that these are intimately correlated.  \n\nAn important finding for this group has to do with how we may  in\nfact detect external influences in the physical world. If  El-Khazen\nhas it right, two EM waves must align in order for the  preception\nprocess to even begin. If this does not happen, there is nothing  to\nperceive, even though we may be impacted by an external  potentially\ninfluencing EM wave. The second wave is generated from  borrowed\nenergy within our brain cells and is modelled upon the structure  of\nDNA strands. So yes we are impacted by billions of EM signals  per\nsecond but we actually detect only a small portion of these that  we\nlater process in the late-stage perceptual processes. \n\nThis would  nicely explain why two people would perceive events\ndifferently despite the  fact that they were literally side by side\nwitnessing the same event. Again  this is strictly a matter of\nrandom probability, it seems to have nothing  whatsoever to do with\nvolition or intention. That is more the focus of the  later\nperceptual processing which is in turn dependent upon  this\nprobabilistic process.\n\nThis could also explain why it is that  EVP and ITC signals are\nperceived differently by different people even when  no physical\nalteration to the media has occurred and why different things  are\nheard more easily at different times by the same  person.\n\n\n\n\n\n**************Huge savings on HDTVs from Dell.com! \n(http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100126575x1221836042x1201399880/aol?redir=http:%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.ne\nt%2Fclk%3B215073686%3B37034322%3Bb)\n\r\n-------------------------------1242917803\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3DUS-ASCII&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Type&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18702&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot; id=3Drole_body =\r\n\nbottomMargin=3D7 leftMargin=3D7 rightMargin=3D7 topMargin=3D7&gt;&lt;FONT id=3Dr=\r\nole_document \ncolor=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Excellent.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In a message dated 5/21/2009 10:53:17 A.M.
