But I did two session=\r\ns yesterday, and very little came through except for being told that a fami=\r\nly friend has died (I&#39;m waiting to see if that bit of prediction has come t=\r\nrue). So maybe, like you said, Steve &quot;led&quot; everyone and made things come th=\r\nrough clearer. I guess time will tell. If he&#39;d behave himself, I&#39;d welcome =\r\nhim back.\n\n                  So I&#39;m wondering, what&#39;s the rationale behind =\r\nthis comment:\n\n                  First, the MiniBox works best with time. I=\r\nf you do not have two hours to devote to a session, you might be disappoint=\r\ned. You should have the device running in the place you will be using it fo=\r\nr at least 15 minutes; during this time you can fine tune settings and volu=\r\nme. Never expect the Box to &quot;Hit the ground running,&quot; so to speak; it happe=\r\nns occasionally, that an operator can turn on the box and get an immediate =\r\nmessage, but it hasn&#39;t happened often in the ASUP&#39;s tests.\n\n               =\r\n   http://www.asup- inc.org/interimm iniboxreport. htm\n\n                  I=\r\n can&#39;t imagine the above quote is good advice. The very first moment I turn=\r\ned on my little hacked box, I got a clear, loud message: I see you. It frea=\r\nked me out so bad, I turned it off immediately and it took three days to wo=\r\nrk up the nerve to try again! So I don&#39;t know what these people are talking=\r\n about, that you can&#39;t hit the ground running. I&#39;ve read about lots of folk=\r\ns doing just that.\n\n                  I was kind of thinking that shorter w=\r\nas better, too, but I wanted to make sure, because if I was wrong, maybe le=\r\ntting it run a long time might get even better responses... but yeah, I thi=\r\nnk they get tired, as it probably takes a lot of effort to form those words=\r\n.\n\n                  I was also thinking all those skeptics who say the box=\r\nes don&#39;t work are probably not treating their sessions like EVP -- I can ne=\r\nver hear much of anything during the session, only afterward when I listen =\r\nback and at very high volume. At least for me, most of the bulk of the comm=\r\nunication is very, very quiet and located in between the louder snippets of=\r\n strong-signaled radio announcer voices. I imagine it might be louder and c=\r\nlearer if I took my set-up to a haunted location (or some place lots of hum=\r\nan emotions were felt), but since my set-up isn&#39;t really geared for that, I=\r\n haven&#39;t done it yet. \n\n                  --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, =\r\n&quot;bulletbabea&quot; &lt;bulletbabea@ ...&gt; wrote:\n                  &gt;\n               =\r\n   &gt; Hiya Jill. yep everyone had a busy weekend.

I find that spirits speak in bursts of ener=\r\ngy and if I record for long periods of time I get very little but if I reco=\r\nrd for a short period of time they make much better use of that time. Also =\r\nit is much easier to analyze short recordings in depth.\n                  &gt;=\r\n \n                  &gt; The only time Ive recorded long sessions is if I am i=\r\nn a group or circle and want to record whats being said by us as well as sp=\r\nirit. Being out on investigations one might choose to record there longer a=\r\ns you document your investigation but for straight evp work i usually do be=\r\ntween 30 seconds and 3 minutes and no longer. They use the time wisely. And=\r\n the voices are much louder. When doing the group or circle such as with a =\r\nmedium they also have been loud as we were but again its much more energy i=\r\nn the room when doing those things.\n                  &gt; \n                  =\r\n&gt; Again its just my viewpoint and others may think differently or have diff=\r\nerent experiences.

At least for me, most=\r\n of the bulk of \n                  the communication is very, very quiet an=\r\nd located in between \n                  the louder snippets of strong-signa=\r\nled radio announcer voices. \n                  I imagine it might be louder=\r\n and clearer if I took my set-up \n                  to a haunted location (=\r\nor some place lots of human emotions \n                  were felt), but sin=\r\nce my set-up isn&#39;t really geared for that, \n                  I haven&#39;t don=\r\ne it yet. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A \n                  href=3D&quot;http://us.mc329.mail=\r\n.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3DEVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; \n                  re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;/A&gt;, \n               =\r\n   &quot;bulletbabea&quot; &lt;bulletbabea@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n         =\r\n         Hiya Jill. yep everyone had a busy weekend. Many out of town \n    =\r\n              at the various events or dealing with family and work. Some \n=\r\n                  are recovering from having too much fun.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n A \n                  tech in reference to evp usually represents what some=\r\n others \n                  call a guide. A helper of sorts whether its just=\r\n to get \n                  information or to help resolve an issue. They of=\r\nten appear \n                  over and over and act as a &quot;lead&quot; for the gro=\r\nup of \n                  speakers.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As for how long you rec=\r\nord \n                  personally I have to say short is better. I find tha=\r\nt spirits \n                  speak in bursts of energy and if I record for =\r\nlong periods of \n                  time I get very little but if I record f=\r\nor a short period of \n                  time they make much better use of t=\r\nhat time. Also it is much \n                  easier to analyze short record=\r\nings in depth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                  The only time Ive record=\r\ned long sessions is if I am in a group \n                  or circle and wan=\r\nt to record whats being said by us as well as \n                  spirit. Be=\r\ning out on investigations one might choose to record \n                  the=\r\nre longer as you document your investigation but for \n                  str=\r\naight evp work i usually do between 30 seconds and 3 \n                  min=\r\nutes and no longer. They use the time wisely. And the \n                  vo=\r\nices are much louder. When doing the group or circle such as \n             =\r\n     with a medium they also have been loud as we were but again \n         =\r\n         its much more energy in the room when doing those \n               =\r\n   things.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Again its just my viewpoint and \n              =\r\n    others may think differently or have different experiences. \n          =\r\n        Hope that helps!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Misty&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- \n     =\r\n             In &lt;A \n                  href=3D&quot;http://us.mc329.mail.yahoo.co=\r\nm/mc/compose?to=3DEVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; \n                  rel=3Dnofol=\r\nlow target=3D_blank&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;/A&gt;, \n                  &quot;mrsca=\r\nptainjack2&quot; &lt;jjkamp@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                  =\r\n&gt; Hi guys! I didn&#39;t receive any response to my last \n                  q=\r\nuestion, and maybe that&#39;s because everyone is busy with real \n             =\r\n     life and whatnot. I know some of you were out of town, so I \n         =\r\n         thought I&#39;d post my question again, hoping someone will be \n      =\r\n            kind enough to offer his or her infinite wisdom and \n          =\r\n        opinions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; What is a &quot;tech,&quot; and is \n    =\r\n              it desirable to have one? Is this like a helper on the other =\r\n\n                  side? I&#39;ve tried googling this, but haven&#39;t found anythi=\r\nng \n                  about this anywhere. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do y=\r\nou guys \n                  find that it&#39;s better to do short sessions (15 m=\r\ninutes) or \n                  long ones (two hours)?
