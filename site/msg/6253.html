<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Bruce--

This is so wonderful, it made me get all teared up. That is so very  
definitely her voice. I have not a single doubt in my mind (and you  
know that&#x27;s saying something). And I am so touched that they  
mentioned me by my nickname. It&#x27;s just beautiful and it has uplifted  
my whole day.

I suspect Sarah is going to be a regular once she gets up and  
running. She was such a dynamo and I can only hope to be a 10th of  
what she was.

And you, my friend, are the best, too. I mean that.

Ann
