But... that&#39;s only when the Ol&#39; Lady ain&#39;t looking over my shoulder! I have to tell everyone--she&#39;s pissed!!!! Way too much time in the basement, and way to much money spent on something she considers useless.  I&#39;m rushing on yet another proto type, one that gets rid of random mode, and has all functions, linear, with direct voice mode, or though a sound chamber. Then---it&#39;s time to play with tones. \n&gt; \n&gt; Random mode, depsite the professed theory out there, no longer works for me, maybe it&#39;s psychological, but the damn circuits won&#39;t even function. Random in the #24 box would not work at all at the Stanley, so I&#39; am abandoning that function. I know what Moon claims about the raw having to be random--simply not true, that was based on my assumptions about how the box worked in the early days of boxology. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.comFrom: bulletbabea@...: Sun, 2 Dec 2007 18:26:41 -0800Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Spiraling out of control- Enough of the namecalling and fighting!!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To ALL members of this group,\n&gt;I agree with Steve. Ive told you all this many times yet some of you like to get caught up in the heat of the moment.\n&gt; \n&gt;It is very disturbing to watch you all try to win this war of words. There is no winner just a bunch of losers. And while you are busy losing theres no GOOD research being performed by YOU.\n&gt; \n&gt;How much research did YOU do today? How much time did you spend firing off replies to attempt to respond to someone you dont even know about something that doesnt even involve YOU? How much time did you spend replying to join in the arguments you feel do involve YOU?\n&gt; \n&gt;The point being, this is a research group for ITC not a boxing room and definitely your own personal battlegrounds. Take that elsewhere. Healthy discussion is one thing but I have seen very few people offering that. In fact I know a few of you joined here just to go after someone who ticked you off. Then there are those who just seem to be firing in all directions, taget doesnt matter.\n&gt; \n&gt;Get a grip people!! Ive seen 4 year olds with more self control. If you arent interested in researching ITC for yourself then what the heck are YOU doing HERE. \n&gt; \n&gt;ONCE AGAIN THIS IS AN ITC RESEARCH GROUP!! \n&gt; \n&gt;As for the box Frank is and always has been the first/primary tester of any box he has built. \n&gt; \n&gt;lol\n&gt;Misty\n&gt; \n&gt;P.S. I think you all are capable of finding better things to do, if not let me know and I will give you a few ideas =)\n&gt;Steve Hultay &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I think we should all focus at the research at hand and forget what everyone else is doing. I personally know Chris and think he&#39;s a great guy and frank feels the same way most days. This has gotten to the point where i can&#39;t even do a session anymore because i&#39;m so blocked by negative thoughts from this group it&#39;s pointless to concentrate on the box and get results. Honestly who cares what chris does anyway, does it really affect everyone&#39;s lives that much. I have a job and this is a hobby that i used to really like, but now this board has brought me down. It seems all people want to do is make this like a street fight with challenges and negative views and for what reason? If anyone is concerned about hearing Chris&#39;s audio, i have about 2 hours of box sessions from Eastern State on my web site for all to listen to. It&#39;s www.keyportparanormal.com and go to investigation and click on eastern state. All the audio is at the bottom of that page and you guys can judge for yourself and i heard a lot come out of that box that night personally because i repeated a lot of stuff back to chris that i heard. Enough already, let&#39;s move on to the next great thing. That radio shack hack was a great breakthrough here, let&#39;s just be happy we got that before it was shut down. Now we have another avenue to go down, but we can&#39;t do it with all these negatives out there. Let&#39;s move on to new topics and anyone out there that bought a Radio Shack box, start sharing your files with the group so it&#39;s not just us same 5 that post all the time.-Steve H.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Be a better sports nut!
