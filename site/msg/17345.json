I wonder if there&#39;s\nsomething else going on, but I don&#39;t do any &quot;investigations&quot; myself.\nContrary the regular skeptics though, I&#39;ll listen to what others get and\nconsider the evidence.\n\n Even with EVPs, you can&#39;t define it as one thing or another. There seems to\nbe multiple levels, or demesnions that come through, and I don&#39;t know how to\ntell them apart.\n\n Frank-S\n\nOn Fri, May 28, 2010 at 10:05 AM, David Koenig\n&lt;floridajakeblues@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve never posted an EVP but I do like to read about everyone else.

As soon as I  get those, I will post them.  But I don&#39;t see the point\n&gt;&gt; of me just posting stuff to say &#39;me too!&#39;, or to follow the crowd, or to try\n&gt;&gt; to fit in.  I am not disparaging those who have those results, and do post\n&gt;&gt; them.  And since this is a discussion,group, it seems we should be able to\n&gt;&gt; discuss them, and question, and make suggestions.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Civilly.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Also, Misty, there is more to &#39;research&#39; than everybody doing and saying\n&gt;&gt; the same thing.  Even in what might seem a well-scoped area of study, people\n&gt;&gt; can be at different levels of knowledge, or interest, or focus.  Some people\n&gt;&gt; here are interested mostly in the hardware.  Some have no interest or talent\n&gt;&gt; there, and focus on using the technology.  Some stand back some, looking at\n&gt;&gt; process, controls, quality assurance.  Some may just be interested in the\n&gt;&gt; psychic or paranormal components.  Some may be more interested in the &quot;Is\n&gt;&gt; there anything there&quot; question.  Some, &quot;I know something&#39;s there, but what\n&gt;&gt; is it?&quot;.  Some &quot;I know there are ghosts there, what do they want?&quot;.  Some,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;I know what they want, how can I help?&quot;.  And so on.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One person giving their perspective, in a different focus, or a different\n&gt;&gt; opinion, is not, &quot;crap&quot;, or &quot;wasting time&quot;.   It should be seen as healthy,\n&gt;&gt; helping a science stretch and check, redirect or confirm,  grow and\n&gt;&gt; explore.  To swat that down is a source of the negativity.  And if you are\n&gt;&gt; concerned about negative comments, go back and read the threads, and see who\n&gt;&gt; is actually making the insults.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But, to make what I consider a positive suggestion, I would suggest people\n&gt;&gt; stop insulting others with different opinions, and allow civil discussion,\n&gt;&gt; and consider that none of us knows it all, and can still learn things from\n&gt;&gt; others.  In fact, I hope that is the real purpose of the group.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- On *Fri, 5/28/10, April Abercrombie &lt;\n&gt;&gt; april@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From: April Abercrombie &lt;april@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Enough of the BS\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; Date: Friday, May 28, 2010, 7:03 AM\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mind you, it hasn&#39;t been too many, because I don&#39;t get many EVP&#39;s that I\n&gt;&gt; deem worthy enough to put up as evidence.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My sole purpose with this whole volley this last few days was to try and\n&gt;&gt; convince Frank that I am not picking on him or his research by being\n&gt;&gt; skeptical.

If you did then please refresh my memory. This seems to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more about commenting on what others share for you than it is about doing\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any research yourself. Im not sure what you are looking for, if you are here\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to learn, correspond, or if you are just here to get a rise out of others\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but to be honest I do not have time for it.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whether Frank bans anyone or not is up to him entirely.
