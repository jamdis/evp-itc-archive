<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Indeed, I am new to the box type method of itc, but the results I 
have been getting from the shack hack box cannot be denied. I will 
admit there is the possibility of audio paradolia and coincidence, 
but the results and the specific details and names I have been 
getting in direct answers to my questions are far to personal and 
accurate to be totally coincidence. I too noticed from my very first 
session that reviewing the recording brings out so much more detail. 
I was able to detect redundant answers to my questions in addition to 
the answers I heard live. Good stuff and best of luck.

thanks, 
Andy

&gt; I find that i miss a lot in real-time when doing a session live.  
&gt; That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s always good to record and review what you may have  
&gt; missed.  I would love to hear your recordings and see what you&#x27;ve 
&gt; been getting.  And you are using a mobile phone....that&#x27;s 
&gt; interesting.  That continues to prove that they will use anything 
we 
&gt; have to communicate.
&gt; 
&gt; Good Job and continued success,
&gt; -Steve H.

&gt; &gt; Within the last week I came across the concept of the ghost box 
&gt; &gt; (Frank&#x27;s box) and have had immediate results.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is actually using a mobile phone on radio mode with a manual 
&gt; scan, 
&gt; &gt; simply holding down the button and it scans through the FM bands 
&gt; either 
&gt; &gt; up or down. There was no white noise being played at the same 
time 
&gt; nor 
&gt; &gt; on review.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What surprised me was the clarity of the answers to direct 
&gt; questions 
&gt; &gt; which could then be checked on a reviewing the tape. But also 
that 
&gt; on 
&gt; &gt; one ocassion the replies weren&#x27;t audible until the replay of the 
&gt; taped 
&gt; &gt; session was heard.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is this typical?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I can upload the sessions which are quite interesting due to the 
&gt; &gt; subject being discussed.
