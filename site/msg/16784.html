I use a 2 inch PVC pipe on my "Tom's Tube"  The heavy walls make it a good =

"echo chamber/resonator" 
I personally suspect that most of the sound mani=
pulation, on the part of 
the entities takes place IN the resonator.  It ma=
y provide a special 
contained place for them to do their work while interc=
epting the sounds 
from the loudspeaker. 
I wonder if we feed EM or some ki=
nd of electric based energy TO the 
resonator, if it will give the entities=
 more energy to generate better 
voices.  You supposed an energized wire CO=
IL around the resonator tube 
might do this?

 Well, since the box will pick =
up thoughts of the living, I think it would 
be impossible to determine if =
a voice was external, or internal. Maybe try 
have these people record, as =
in write down, what their voices say, and see 
if it makes any sense.
