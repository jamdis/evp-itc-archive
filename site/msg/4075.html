<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks, Mike.  I think that answers it, but I&#x27;ll probably be back to 
you with more questions as I begin experimenting more. ;)

&gt; Hi LC,
&gt; 
&gt; The two setups I did were:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Three 12-469&#x27;s through a mixer, mixed with white noise 
(performed 
&gt; with Audacity), my voice via a microphone, and all that audio 
&gt; captured using a free program called &quot;Scanner Recorder&quot;. You can 
&gt; download it here: http://www.davee.com/scanrec/
&gt; I have not really taken that unit anywhere to test it properly.  I 
&gt; only did the original testing you hear on the video.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) One 12-470 placed in a &quot;chamber&quot;, with a noise generator (used 
&gt; a &quot;My Lil&#x27; Reminder&quot; 20 second digital recorder/player) with 
recorded 
&gt; white/pink noise I captured while in Florida.  Also inside is 
&gt; a &quot;Listen Up&quot; amplified microphone and an Olympus digital recorder.
&gt; The only wiring is a Y-connector which connects the output from the 
&gt; amplified mic to the input of the recorder, and also to ear-buds 
for 
&gt; listening to what is being recorded. You can also plug a small 
&gt; speaker into this if desired.
&gt; The raw audio from the linear sweep of either the AM or FM band is 
&gt; projected from the 12-470 speaker, into the closed &quot;chamber&quot;, along 
&gt; with the audio from the speaker of the noise generator (&quot;My Lil&#x27; 
&gt; Reminder&quot;) unit.  Those two sources, plus any ambient noise inside 
&gt; the &quot;chamber&quot; is picked up by the amplified mic and fed into the 
&gt; recorder and ear-buds. The recorder produces the .wav file.
&gt; You can use a 12-469 instead of the 12-470. You just need to 
connect 
&gt; a small speker to the output of the 12-469.
&gt; 
&gt; As with my three 12-469 system, I have so far only done the initial 
&gt; test run on th 12-470 system.  I hope to bring both units to a 
place 
&gt; where I can do some better experimentation.  I have 2 weeks off 
near 
&gt; Christmas time, so that is probably when I&#x27;ll be doing that.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope I have answered your questions, LC.
&gt; 
&gt; - Mike

&gt; &gt; Mike,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Today I modified my Radio Shack 12-469, but have some questions.  
&gt; It 
&gt; &gt; was easy to do, and I instantly plugged it into my Olympus voice 
&gt; &gt; recorder and recorded off of it easily.  Now I want to pipe some 
&gt; &gt; white noise in (and ambient), as well. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1) Is the set-up in your video what has worked best for you (with 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; computer and all)?
&gt; &gt; 2) Will you tell us what free computer programs you used (I think 
&gt; one 
&gt; &gt; is Audacity)?
&gt; &gt; 3) What microphone and white noise generator did you use for your 
&gt; &gt; travel pack unit pictured on UFOGeek.com (posted on December 
8th)?  
&gt; &gt; And can you give me a layout for the wiring of it - you know, how 
&gt; it 
&gt; &gt; all hooks together?  I&#x27;ll figure it out sooner or later, but I&#x27;d 
&gt; &gt; rather it be sooner!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks, LC
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am currently putting together another video, just like my 
&gt; others 
&gt; &gt; &gt; showing a very practical way to use the Radio Shack Hack 
devices.
&gt; &gt; &gt; You probably saw my 12-469 practical use videos, now I&#x27;m going 
to 
&gt; &gt; be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; sharing a 12-470 practical use video.  This one is of a totally 
&gt; &gt; &gt; portable system that uses a noise generator, the hacked 12-470, 
a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; digital (or analog) recorder, and a microphone which gathers 
the 
&gt; &gt; raw 
&gt; &gt; &gt; audio sweep, white noise (or in my case a special white/pink 
&gt; noise 
&gt; &gt; file 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I created), and any ambient noise within a chamber.. and places 
&gt; &gt; that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; session int a .wav file.  It also includes an ear piece so you 
&gt; can 
&gt; &gt; &gt; hear, real time, what the digital recorder is recording (the 
&gt; mixer 
&gt; &gt; of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the session sound within the chamber).
&gt; &gt; &gt; Stay tuned for that video later today....
