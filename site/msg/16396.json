I&#39;m a certifi=\r\ned medium with a Spiritualist church. This was a two year process which inv=\r\nolved proving I can communicate with spirits to a congregation (not braggin=\r\ng - just trying to explain my background and why I know what I do). I&#39;m als=\r\no one of the biggest skeptics you&#39;ll ever meet (It was one of two reasons I=\r\n became a medium. I wanted to see how they were &quot;faking&quot; it. Surprise! They=\r\n weren&#39;t). I&#39;d like to contribute what I&#39;ve learned about spirits. As Jill =\r\nwrote, &quot;I(t) really takes personal experience to believe this stuff exists&quot;=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;As to her main question of &quot;Why do spirits lie&quot;, I don&#39;t think we =\r\ncan always assume they&#39;re lying. If the information comes through a medium,=\r\n one of the first items to address is whether or not the medium received th=\r\ne message correctly and then whether or not he/she interepreted it correctl=\r\ny and phrased it in a way that allowed the recipient to understand the spir=\r\nit&#39;s meaning. There are a variety of ways spirits communicate with mediums;=\r\n some are easier than others to understand and pass on. For the harder meth=\r\nods, it would be possible for a medium to inadvertently misinterept the mes=\r\nsage based on his/her past experiences. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When we look at the questio=\r\nn from the connection to EVP&#39;s and ghost boxes, we have to examine a few it=\r\nems. Was the spirit able to use the devices correctly to form the words he/=\r\nshe actually intended? This is a two step process. It can be difficult for =\r\nthem to not only pull the available energy into a useable form, but to also=\r\n form the correct words (think it as a foreigner learning English and sayin=\r\ng &quot;car&quot; when they mean &quot;star&quot;. They sound similar, but have very different =\r\nmeanings). \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Did we understand the words they said? It&#39;s fairly easy =\r\nto get them wrong, especially in instances where you aren&#39;t the first perso=\r\nn to listen to the recording and someone else says, &quot;Here listen to this. I=\r\n think they&#39;re saying (fill in the blank)&quot;. Our brains are going to tell us=\r\n (fill in the blank) simply because that thought is now prevalent. If we&#39;re=\r\n the only person listening to the recordings, the same mistake can be made.=\r\n The only conclusive way is to use equipment that can amplify and break dow=\r\nn the recordings to make them clear enough to be agreed upon by a number of=\r\n people who don&#39;t know what conclusions the other listeners have drawn. \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The idea of a spirit distorting the facts must also be considered. Not=\r\n lying, per se, but rather getting the facts within their reality confused.=\r\n This is where you have the right to have the facts validated by the spirit=\r\n. Ask them to prove it to you. They can tell you some corresponding items t=\r\nhat back up their claims, direct you to old newspaper stories or to a perso=\r\nn they used to affiliate with or bring the validation into your focus (mean=\r\ning the same thing comes into your life while you&#39;re driving/working/ at ho=\r\nme/talking to someone/reading and etc.) at least three times. A spirit who =\r\nis being truthful will not mind trying to make this happen. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Once th=\r\nese have been considered and eliminated, then we should be willing to enter=\r\ntain the idea the spirit may be a lower energy being (a bully/swindler/ con=\r\n-man or woman/narcissist and etc) in their past life and this is the only w=\r\nay they know how to achieve what they want. And yes, those spirits do exist=\r\n. &quot;As in life, so in death&quot;, meaning our personalities don&#39;t change when ou=\r\nr bodies die.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Al, maybe he wasn&#39;t trying to prove anything. Is it po=\r\nssible the spirit voice didn&#39;t mean he WAS (typed larger for emphasis) Stev=\r\ne Tate, but rather wanted to talk ABOUT Steve Tate or get a message TO Stev=\r\ne Tate? Did he mean to say &quot;Still fate&quot;? Could he have meant &quot;paratrooper&quot; =\r\n? See where I&#39;m going with this? \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;And finally, in regards to the &quot;en=\r\nd of the world stuff&quot;, it has been taught to me by mediums and teachers who=\r\n were all very honest and excellent at what they do, and it has been relaye=\r\nd to me by spirits I&#39;ve encountered in my mediumship service that we don&#39;t =\r\nhave a free glimpse of the future once our bodies die and we move into spir=\r\nit form. I mean no offense and I&#39;m not impying that wasn&#39;t what was heard. =\r\nThat said (or rather &#39;typed&#39;), I&#39;d be VERY hesitant to believe this communi=\r\ncation. There are beings that are privvy to the potential (underscore &quot;pote=\r\nntial&quot;) future in our lives, but it isn&#39;t their nature to join us for EVP s=\r\nessions. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I hope I haven&#39;t taken liberty with this forum by posting =\r\nsuch a long reply. I thank you for your time and attention. If you have oth=\r\ner questions or would like me to clarify something, please ask.

I&#39;m also one of the biggest skeptics yo=\r\nu&#39;ll ever meet (It was one of two reasons I became a medium. I wanted to se=\r\ne how they were &quot;faking&quot; it. Surprise! They weren&#39;t). I&#39;d like to contribut=\r\ne what I&#39;ve learned about spirits. As Jill wrote, &quot;I(t) really takes person=\r\nal experience to believe this stuff exists&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;As to her main questio=\r\nn of &quot;Why do spirits lie&quot;, I don&#39;t think we can always assume they&#39;re lying=\r\n. If the information comes through a medium, one of the first items to addr=\r\ness is whether or not the medium received the message correctly and then wh=\r\nether or not he/she interepreted it correctly and phrased it in a way that =\r\nallowed the recipient to understand the spirit&#39;s meaning. There are a varie=\r\nty of ways spirits communicate with mediums; some are easier than others to=\r\n understand and pass on. For the harder methods, it would be possible for a=\r\n medium to inadvertently misinterept the message based on his/her past expe=\r\nriences. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;When we look at the question from the connection to EVP&#39;s=\r\n and ghost boxes, we have to examine a few items. Was the spirit able to us=\r\ne the devices correctly to form the words he/she actually intended? This is=\r\n a two step process. It can be difficult for them to not only pull the avai=\r\nlable energy into a useable form, but to also form the correct words (think=\r\n it as a foreigner learning English and saying &quot;car&quot; when they mean &quot;star&quot;.=\r\n They sound similar, but have very different meanings). &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Did we und=\r\nerstand the words they said? It&#39;s fairly easy to get them wrong, especially=\r\n in instances where you aren&#39;t the first person to listen to the recording =\r\nand someone else says, &quot;Here listen to this. I think they&#39;re saying (fill i=\r\nn the blank)&quot;. Our brains are going to tell us (fill in the blank) simply b=\r\necause that thought is now prevalent. If we&#39;re the only person listening to=\r\n the recordings, the same mistake can be made. The only conclusive way is t=\r\no use equipment that can amplify and break down the recordings to make them=\r\n clear enough to be agreed upon by a number of people who don&#39;t know what c=\r\nonclusions the other listeners have drawn. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;The idea of a spirit di=\r\nstorting the facts must also be considered. Not lying, per se, but rather g=\r\netting the facts within their reality confused. This is where you have the =\r\nright to have the facts validated by the spirit. Ask them to prove it to yo=\r\nu. They can tell you some corresponding items that back up their claims, di=\r\nrect you to old newspaper stories or to a person they used to affiliate wit=\r\nh or bring the validation into your focus (meaning the same thing comes int=\r\no your life while you&#39;re driving/working/ at home/talking to someone/readin=\r\ng and etc.) at least three times. A spirit who is being truthful will not m=\r\nind trying to make this happen. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Once these have been considered an=\r\nd eliminated, then we should be willing to entertain the idea the spirit ma=\r\ny be a lower energy being (a bully/swindler/ con-man or woman/narcissist an=\r\nd etc) in their past life and this is the only way they know how to achieve=\r\n what they want. And yes, those spirits do exist. &quot;As in life, so in death&quot;=\r\n, meaning our personalities don&#39;t change when our bodies die.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Al, m=\r\naybe he wasn&#39;t trying to prove anything. Is it possible the spirit voice di=\r\ndn&#39;t mean he WAS (typed larger for emphasis) Steve Tate, but rather wanted =\r\nto talk ABOUT Steve Tate or get a message TO Steve Tate? Did he mean to say=\r\n &quot;Still fate&quot;? Could he have meant &quot;paratrooper&quot; ? See where I&#39;m going with=\r\n this? &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;And finally, in regards to the &quot;end of the world stuff&quot;, it=\r\n has been taught to me by mediums and teachers who were all very honest and=\r\n excellent at what they do, and it has been relayed to me by spirits I&#39;ve e=\r\nncountered in my mediumship service that we don&#39;t have a free glimpse of th=\r\ne future once our bodies die and we move into spirit form. I mean no offens=\r\ne and I&#39;m not impying that wasn&#39;t what was heard. That said (or rather &#39;typ=\r\ned&#39;), I&#39;d be VERY hesitant to believe this communication. There are beings =\r\nthat are privvy to the potential (underscore &quot;potential&quot;) future in our liv=\r\nes, but it isn&#39;t their nature to join us for EVP sessions. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;I hope =\r\nI haven&#39;t taken liberty with this forum by posting such a long reply. I tha=\r\nnk you for your time and attention. If you have other questions or would li=\r\nke me to clarify something, please ask. I&#39;d be honored to share what I know=\r\n and track down what I don&#39;t. :) &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Michelle&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;COLOR:rgb(255,255,255);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquo=\r\nte&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;COLOR:#fff;&quot;&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;position:fixed&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;!-- cg30.c4.mail.gq1.yahoo=\r\n.com compressed/chunked Wed Dec  9 12:26:04 PST 2009 --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/htm=\r\nl&gt;\r\n--0-565260119-1260412355=:93130--"}
