attacked ?? Wow , how dramatic... It's just a fact that you will make Frank=
 mad again.
For instance: IT is very obvious that when Frank gets something=
 from the box about
stuff that says what is going to happen, YOU have to sa=
y I will add that to your predictions.
Those are not Frank's predictions, h=
e is just posting the messages, and it is very clear
that he does not like =
you saying or posting that those are his predictions.....
Maybe you should =
pick your words a little better in the future, or better yet, maybe you sho=
uld just
not say anything, and just put the info in your little files to sa=
ve, and no one would be
the wiser..
I'm tired of giving you so much time in=
 this group, so I hope I don't have to ATTACK you anymore LOL

BTW, if anyone is wondering what I am talking about, this was a good exa=

I offer a suggestion on getting things back on track with less hostil=

I expect none of us like all the recent attacks, insul=
ts, accusations, threats, hurting of feelings, and attempts to piss people =
off.

Can I suggest we stick to the purpose of the group: "the discussion, =
promotion, and developemnt of Electronic Voice Phenomenon, and Instrumental=
 Transcommunication methods and technologies as used in the communication w=
ith spirit, and other entities."

And that we go with Frank's philosophy "j=
ust take the approach, try different methods, see what works."

No more thr=
eats. No name calling, insults, or accusations. Just try to keep a positive=
 group attitude, be open that not everyone believes what everyone else does=
, and that's ok?
