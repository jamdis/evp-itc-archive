There seems to be a &#39;field&#39; \n&gt;associated with the process so I don&#39;t know for sure if physical contact \n&gt;with the tuner is required or even helps.  I found another voice towards \n&gt;the start of the same session. This is a slower talker but to my ears the \n&gt;same voice throughout. I hear a male voice and this does require some \n&gt;mental filtering of the high frequency noise. The time that the message is \n&gt;spoken is important because I would have tuned across at least half the FM \n&gt;broadcast band during the message segment.\n&gt;&quot;Dav-id&#39;s tuning (or) Dave has/is tuning&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Dave\n&gt;\n&gt;--- franks-boxes@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;From: &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Sweep Tuning of AM Radio Band -\n&gt;Date: Fri, 30 Mar 2007 07:28:53 -0600\n&gt;\n&gt;This stuff  never ceases to amaze me! I have my add on sweep board ready,\n&gt;but I wonder just how important is the human touch on the radio. I was\n&gt;thinking about adding a plate connected to the circuit ground that I just\n&gt;touch while recording.\n&gt;\n&gt;I haven&#39;t heard much about those &quot;stations&quot; in other cities, and countries\n&gt;for a few years. I still get them once in a while. I think I spend way too\n&gt;much time putting boards together, and don&#39;t get time to play. This voice\n&gt;even sounds like a British accent.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Sweep Tuning of AM Radio Band -\n&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 29 Mar 2007 17:59:38 -0700\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thanks for the feedback Frank you have a good ear for these messages. \n&gt;Tried\n&gt; &gt;something different tonight. I have a small tesla coil in the basement \n&gt;that\n&gt; &gt;I can run powered mainly by audio (music). This creates broadband noise \n&gt;on\n&gt; &gt;both AM and FM bands on my upstairs tuner. his is a capture doing a sweep\n&gt; &gt;tuning of the FM band while the Tesla coil was running.\n&gt; &gt;&quot;We heard along from Tesla that one human&#39;s going to be testing&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The chatter indicates the message is coming from a control point in \n&gt;London!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Dave\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- franks-boxes@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Sweep Tuning of AM Radio Band -\n&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 29 Mar 2007 13:09:59 -0600\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t know, could be, to me it sounds like &quot;Our Chris-he is giving our\n&gt; &gt;reception&quot;, like maybe they are trying to say Chris is getting these \n&gt;guys.\n&gt; &gt;Frank\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Sweep Tuning of AM Radio Band -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Date: Wed, 28 Mar 2007 17:50:15 -0700\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Frank, I got this tonight and it sounds like the same voice swept \n&gt;through\n&gt; &gt; &gt;several station channels. Could they be talking about the Christopher \n&gt;who\n&gt; &gt; &gt;uses one of your boxes?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Our Chris.....Is giving a reception&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Dave\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WOW!! I am amazed that someonme actually tried this! It does work.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;There was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a Danish(I think) researcher doing the same thing, but never could\n&gt; &gt; &gt;make\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contact with them. I have done this myself, and it can work wiht TV\n&gt; &gt; &gt;too, if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you can switch channels fast ennough. I think you could use a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;steeper motor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; controler to randomly turn a stepper moter, to turn the dial.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Manually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spinning the dial has one advantage, the sound is clearer! I have\n&gt; &gt; &gt;yet to see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a method of ITC that produces better results that the random tuning\n&gt; &gt; &gt;methods.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;To: &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Sweep Tuning of AM Radio Band\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Date: Mon, 19 Mar 2007 17:19:47 -0700\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I have a very sensitive old AM tuner with a flywheel tuning\n&gt; &gt; &gt;system. I tried\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;several recording sessions manually sweeping the tuner through the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;AM band\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;late at night. I got pretty good at keeping the dial moving at a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;constant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;rate of speed. This is not nearly as good as Frank&#39;s &#39;hands off&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;random\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;tuning method but it still produced some results. What impressed\n&gt; &gt; &gt;me most is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that some of the voices sound the same, even though I tuned\n&gt; &gt; &gt;through several\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;channels.
