<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>As you all know, so far the experiments we&#x27;ve devised to try to show the efficacy of &#x27;ghost boxes&#x27;, while removing subjective perceptions of the human operator, have all failed to show anything paranormal.

And so far, we have had several comments on why that is:

1) Too many spirits talking all at once
2) Spirits don&#x27;t know anything more than the human operator
3) Spirits need more information to participate (exact locations, etc)
4) People&#x27;s expectations shape what the spirit says
5) I myself have the power to block your valid responses because I have been said to expect invalid results
6) There are no spirits there: the human operator is just trying to decide what the noise &#x27;sounds like&#x27;, using their own subjective guessing.

In order to improve the experiments, I&#x27;d like as much input on why you think we have so far shown been unable to demonstrate any paranormal operations from the ghost box whatsoever.

Any more comments?  Any specific claims that we can test, and ideas how we can test them?</pre>
