It wasn't suicide, it was accidental:
Carradine Death Was Accidental

IMDb,=
 June 4, 2009

David Carradine died during a sex game that went wrong, acco=
rding to sources in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was found dead on Thursday.=


Carradine's body was discovered in a hotel suite and local reports sugges=
ted he committed suicide. 

He was discovered by a maid, naked and hanged, =
but the suggestions his death had a sexual twist were strongly disputed by =
the star's close friend, attorney Vicki Roberts, and his manager Chuck Bind=
er, who insisted he died of natural causes. 

But a statement from Carradin=
e's representative now indicates the actor died during a sex act.

The spok=
esperson tells TMZ.com, "We can confirm 100 percent that he never would hav=
e committed suicide. It was an accidental death. Everybody is in shock." 

=
Rumours Carradine died attempting auto-erotic asphyxiation--where victims a=
chieve heightened sexual pleasure by restricting their air supply are backe=
d up by a quote a Bangkok police officer gave to British newspaper The Sun.=
 

The cop tells reporters, "A rope was attached to his neck and also to hi=
s penis". 

Rocker Michael Hutchence was rumoured to have died attempting t=
he same sex act in a Sydney, Australia, hotel room back in 1997--although h=
is death was officially declared a suicide.

Carradine was in Thailand to s=
hoot the movie "Stretch." He was 72.
