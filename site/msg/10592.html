<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Our / His case is he&#x27;s a friend with a person he games with. They&#x27;ve 
been friends for a while, and he started letting her know he&#x27;s into the 
paranormal. She&#x27;s drastically different, very catholic (being from 
Malta) and didn&#x27;t think this stuff was real. ...but confided in him 
that things are happening to her, her daughter and now husband. He&#x27;s 
talked via the internet /skype with her, and everytime they talk about 
the incidents, other people talk over them. 

Her house has an incredible, negative, history. She&#x27;s actually moving 
out now. 

When she&#x27;s left her messenger up, and skype on, it&#x27;s recorded AND TYPED 
messages to our team member, as well as family.

So I was curious what you did, what you knew and any explanation from 
your experiences.</pre>
