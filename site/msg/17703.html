<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>What you post has nothing whatsoever to do with the subject of this group, your posts are mean spirited personal attacks and address EVP in no way, shape or form. You can&#x27;t adress the facts of the paranormal, all you do is shout science science science, while ignoring all science. 

 I think I&#x27;ve given you a chance to show you have a legitamate interest in this grouop, but it is very clear you only want to be disruptive and negative. You have no interest in truth, facts or science. 

 Nuff said!

&gt; Frank, you didnt let me post and took away my rights to do so.  You got no room to talk about such things.
&gt; 
&gt; And even as of last night you posted that you were going to leave the board.  Yet here we are?
&gt; 
&gt; Shit or get off the pot Frank!  Manke up your mind!  Do what you say and say what you mean!  Grow some balls!  Man up!

&gt; What you don&#x27;t seem to get is that there is more to the individual than the physical body. 
&gt; 
&gt; Apparently reading what one wants to hear is also problem, and seems to ge huge problme with he these skeptics. This one convinced I&#x27;m out to form a group of groupies, and she ignores all else.
&gt; 
&gt; Guess we are not allowed to question out loud, or throw thoughts and theories out there for the consideration and comment of others. Sorry, not being from &quot;here&quot; I didn&#x27;t learn all the social taboos of this primitive culture. I tried goose stepping once, it made my ankles hurt.
&gt; 
&gt; I took the skeptics off moderation in a mistaken effort to be fair, but all this does is disrupt the conversation about what these voices are, and how to hear it and interpret it better. This group is not about how to explain all the inconvenient truths away.
