Same goes with using sound \nsoap for evp&#39;s.  The GE radio i use for the manual sweeps sounds like \nthe old Frank&#39;s boxes in random mode, with the treble turned up it \neven sounds like it has an echo box.  It has a good sound and given a \nbunch of clear answers to me as well, you can hear how fast i&#39;m \nsweeping the dial yet i get the same voice with a full \nsentence....weird.  If you scan up and down the band that fast, how \ndo you get the same voice?\n\n-Steve\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Pridegrl Neverumind \n&lt;charmedbyu20032003@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; since the onslaught of manual sweeps has returned! lol\n&gt;   Charm\n&gt; \n&gt; Steve Hultay &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           \n&gt; Haven&#39;t posted here in a while, but i&#39;m using a manual sweep radio \ni \n&gt; picked up at a flea market for $3 and i&#39;m getting some good \nresults. \n&gt; It&#39;s a GE radio from the 40&#39;s that has a great tuning dial, it&#39;s \nall \n&gt; i&#39;ve been using lately.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                            \n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; All new Yahoo!
