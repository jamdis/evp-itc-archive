&gt;  This is from an older Radio Shack Digital Headphone tuner, their Olympus
&gt; brand. The AM side gets more stations in this house than any other tuner I
&gt; have.  both of these videos start off with some wierd coments coming through
&gt; the radio as I started sweeping by hand. In AM &quot;Pretty impressive actually&quot;,
&gt; and on FM  &quot;Yes, you may find it hard to leave(or believe) Frank&quot;--Weird.
