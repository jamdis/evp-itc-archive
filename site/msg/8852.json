In my opinion the majority of the communication from \nthis method is genuine.\nThe method has produced communication including my name to me as well \nas other researchers that have gotten my name, and some of the \nstatements and responses show signs of a sense of humor that would \nsurely be absent in random word grouping.\n\nWho ever is involved with experimentation of this method, will you \nplease on your next session ask that if there is a spirit named \nArthur for him not to mention his name or the list of words that I \nhave posted. I suggest that this request be made verbally before the \nsession as well as after.\n\nAnd in the most polite manner. They seem to respond better to \nformality.\n\nplease dedicate one session no shorter than 2 minutes to this \nexperiment and post your results.\n\nYour cooperation appreciated.\n\nBruce"}
