[But I find it hard to believe that entities on the oth=
er side who are not dead people would go to so much trouble to impersonate =
my dead friends and relatives]

That's my point....maybe it was nothing. Ma=
ybe it didn't say "Gordy" at all. I don't know-I wasn't there..but just say=
ing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------=

[But since it's equally possible for me or a discarnate dead =
person to influence the box (via me and PK)]

It isn't equally possible. Be=
sides the fact that it hasn't even been proven to happen at all, if it does=
 happen, IMO it would be easier for a ghost to do it as they are not encase=
d in a body. They are pure energy, therefore by their very nature they mani=
pulate electromagnetic fields. We are incased in this flesh, so it is much =
harder for us to manipulate the EMF like a ghost can.

[I do know t=
hat I hear things on the tape that are repeated over and over and over agai=
n, in some cases twelve times in a row, which tends to rule out pareidolia.=
]

If this is the case, then you may well be right. I'm not arguing the pos=
sibility that you may be right, just saying that from an outsider point of =
view, it is hard to prove.

  I don't know for sure it was my dad's =
friend. But I find it hard to believe that entities on the other side who a=
re not dead people would go to so much trouble to impersonate my dead frien=
ds and relatives -- why bother? If they truly seek attention, why not come =
up with something more attention-getting than my dad's friend? Why not impe=
rsonate my brother, who is really the one I'm trying to reach? And anyways,=
 there are hundreds and hundreds of stories of people believing they have s=
een or heard or spoken to the ghost of their dead family members (my mother=
 being one of them). They can't all be wishful thinking.

  I find it much =
easier to believe that I'm somehow unconsciously making this happen (via th=
e process Phenom Investigator describes) using the box. But since it's equa=
lly possible for me or a discarnate dead person to influence the box (via m=
e and PK) (because, after all, we are no different from the dead people exc=
ept we still have our bodies), I will probably never know if it's me or the=
m making it happen. 

  I do know that I hear things on the tape that are r=
epeated over and over and over again, in some cases twelve times in a row, =
which tends to rule out pareidolia. I also have very clear sentences which =
anyone -- ANYONE -- without prompting could understand and hear (I've teste=
d this with friends and family, letting them listen and asking what they he=
ar). And, like I've said, the names I've gotten have mostly been of obscure=
 dead friends and relatives, not the ones I'm trying so desperately to cont=
act.

  So I'm leaning toward the dead people theory for now.
