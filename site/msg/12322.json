Since I have never used one, I am wondering what are the\nsimilarities between the Ovilus and Frank&#39;s Box. Could it be at all\npossible that rather than just forming words or sounds based on\natmospheric readings, spirits are speaking through the Ovilus as they\ndo Frank&#39;s box? \n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t mean to sound silly or presumptous, but I am very very\ncurious!! I am looking forward to purchasing the Ovilus as well as\nthe puck in the near future! Thanks for any feedback onthe Ovilus!\n&gt; \n\n\nThe Ovilus has the ability to form words in the phonetic mode, which I\nwas not using. Does it have the ability to form words in the\ndictionary mode? I do not know. It would seem unlikely. Can spirits\nspeak through the Ovilus like they do Frank&#39;s box? Maybe. Frank&#39;s box\nhas a lot of white noise that can possibly be manipulated by spirits\ninto giving us messages, but the ovilus has words programmed into it&#39;s\nmemory, it would probably take a lot more for entities to inject a\nword into the computer&#39;s memory than to inject a word into white\nnoise. A lot of the words that are coming through that are not on the\nlist is meaningless jibberish as the ovilus detects temperature\nchanges and has nothing to do with the paranormal. I do not believe\nthat the temperture changing could manipulate the components of this\ndevice to the degree that would be needed to actually create words\nlike it is doing. I am betting if enough people catalog words that it\nis saying we&#39;ll probably wind up with another 500 or so beyond what it\nwas supposed to be capable of. \n\nI emailed the creator yesterday offering to send him sound files of\nthe words I am getting so that he can properly identify which of the\n512 words these are, but so far I have not heard back from him in\nregards to this. \n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 10/2/08, Carol B. &lt;cbreck@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Carol B. &lt;cbreck@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] The Ovilus\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, October 2, 2008, 1:12 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have a puck, and I have been getting the name Seth too. I also\nhave had\n&gt; my puck give words that are not on the list.\n&gt; \n&gt; Carol B.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m new here, but have been into paranormal research for 6 years now.\n&gt; &gt; I am the type of person that never gets EVP voices with a recorder so\n&gt; &gt; I thought I would experiment with things like the Frank&#39;s box and\n&gt; &gt; Ovilus. I recently got the ovilus and brought it to a cemetery and\n&gt; &gt; field where a church burned down many years ago. I can not get too\n&gt; &gt; specific without having people thinking I am making stuff up but it\n&gt; &gt; got fairly wild towards the end of the session. For most of the time\n&gt; &gt; we were there the Ovilus seemed to be spitting out a lot of random\n&gt; &gt; stuff but it kept mentioning the name Seth. After we moved over to the\n&gt; &gt; field where the church was, the ovilus got a lot more active and\n&gt; &gt; started saying relevant words like cross and priest. The Ovilus was\n&gt; &gt; MUCH more active when being used by our female member. Towards the end\n&gt; &gt; the Ovilus said I am Seth, and the woman that was with me told Seth\n&gt; &gt; that she did not want to talk to you I&#39;ve heard bad things about you.\n&gt; &gt; After that the Ovilus said rather nasty things to her and she started\n&gt; &gt; feeling nauseous and she ripped the headphones off her head. Needless\n&gt; &gt; to say we ended the session and got out of there.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Over the course of our investigation we found that the Ovilus was\n&gt; &gt; saying many words that are not on the 500 word list, so yesterday I\n&gt; &gt; did some test recordings to see what words would come up and one of\n&gt; &gt; the first things that came up was: seth blamed rest I am not\n&gt; &gt; gare demon (all in that order). Needless to say this has me\n&gt; &gt; concerned that whatever seth is is still with the box so I am not even\n&gt; &gt; storing this thing inside of my house. I have an MP3 of the ovilus\n&gt; &gt; saying this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also from my experience about 50% of the words it is saying aren&#39;t on\n&gt; &gt; the list. Chris Fleming has been getting words not on the list, and\n&gt; &gt; Barry FitzGerald has stated that just over 50% of the words he is\n&gt; &gt; getting are not on the list. Is there really a much larger list than\n&gt; &gt; advertised or is this thing really magic? Highly doubtful IMO.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My most important question is is anyone else getting the name Seth out\n&gt; &gt; of the Ovilus? How many people use this device here?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
