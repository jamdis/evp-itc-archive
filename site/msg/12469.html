<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I feel that it should be mentioned in all fairness, that Steve has
helped me out oodles, and without a condescending or egotistical
attitude. I am not out to make character judgements here, and I may be
ignorant of issues in the past between folks, so I am only qualified
to deal with personal experiences in my short time here. I have been
eager to accept the help of all folks here and in other forums. I have
received tons of help and am very grateful to all involved to keep
this fascinating field moving forward.

Thanks,
Andy</pre>
