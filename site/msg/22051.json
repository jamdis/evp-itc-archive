When i first joined this \n&gt; &gt; group in 2007, it was the only group dedicated to this and it was a rockin&#39; \n&gt; &gt; forum. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We used to get between 1500 to 2000 posts a month, now it gets like 15 to 20 \n&gt; &gt; posts a month. Not sure what happened here. If each member here posted twice a \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; month, it would be like 1800 posts.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure that somebody has to have something to say.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Steve\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;athena97531&quot; &lt;athenamarmalade@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe I should post here - it is hard to get any feedback for my files on two \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;other forums.
