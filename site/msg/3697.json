The page has been changed as of Dec 3rd! Imagine\nthat. The article did indeed state that children and high school\nstudents would be part of the testing groups as well as skeptic,\nbelievers, etc. \nYes I did notice the discrepancy between the asup article and the\ndisclaimers on the paranormal sytems page. \n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, so much for the &quot;Oh Noes!1!!

Do not allow children under the age of 16 to use this device\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2. Although individual sessions are effective, group sessions are more\n&gt; &gt; productive.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3. This is not an &#39;electronic Ouija board&#39; - no harm can come from\n&gt; &gt; using it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 4. Some voices will use coarse language so be prepared for it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 5. Always use a recorder to tape all sessions\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 6. Keep a notebook with the times and locations of your sessions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 7. The MiniBox will call you by name so don&#39;t be startled by it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lance\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
