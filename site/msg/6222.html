<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Here&#x27;s an interesting one that Nick got on his first session with the  
RS 20-125 hack. I didn&#x27;t post it earlier because I didn&#x27;t think it  
was clear enough, but I offer it now anyway, since its the first real  
&quot;cosmic&quot; box communication we&#x27;ve gotten. It was not in response to  
any question. The file is slowed by about 40 percent. I believe it  
says, &quot;Look for life; look for death.&quot; The final word may be the name  
Kate. I&#x27;m not sure. It&#x27;s the first part that intrigues me.

&gt; In my opinion what our friends mean by the messages
&gt; of &quot;no more time&quot; or &quot;time running out&quot; Is meant
&gt; as a warning to mankind that if we do not change and realise that life
&gt; and mother earth are precious, and how to live together
&gt; in &quot;harmony&quot; we are doomed to extinction.
&gt;
&gt; The sense of urgency I believe is meant to make us understand that  
&gt; global tensions
&gt; at this time could very well bring about this destruction, If  
&gt; someone decides to turn left instead of right.
&gt;
&gt; That&#x27;s my take on these type of messages, and I get at least one  
&gt; every couple of sessions.

&gt; Nice, interesting files, Bruce.
&gt;
&gt; You and FS (his post today) got me wondering about this time no more
&gt; thing...not to mention I heard similar statements of urgency over  
&gt; my RS
&gt; box set-up, too.
&gt;
&gt; Any more ideas regarding this, Bruce...FS...others? I personally
&gt; believe time to be illusion, and I also know it is written &quot;time will
&gt; be no more&quot; (biblical future prophecy).
&gt;
&gt; Still not sure where I fall with this, other than I do agree on this
&gt; urgency, elevating consciousness, etc

&gt; &gt; Hey boy&#x27;s and girls,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here are some new Frank&#x27;s box files. You may find the ones about
&gt; sweep
&gt; &gt; rate interesting.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There are quite a few good ones, New researchers please take note of
&gt; &gt; the different sound between Frank&#x27;s box and the RS boxes. The
&gt; operation
&gt; &gt; of the box and the sound and files it produces are very unique to
&gt; each
&gt; &gt; FB.
