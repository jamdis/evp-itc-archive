<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Oh yeah! I got busy and forget the pix. I deleted the first ones I took. I 
did get another frame welded up, but set it aside due to weather, and so I 
could get these boards done. At the moment I don&#x27;t have any of the newer 
boxes to use myself, but there&#x27;s always EVPmaker, and the foreign language 
method.This week I&#x27;m ordering three more of the mini boards I did last 
spring. I have most of the parts I need for those, and I can make those 
systems very compact.

&gt;
&gt;LOL Gee I wonder who got those =)
&gt;
&gt;   I think maybe it just takes longer because you realized you wanted to do 
&gt;it a little different and that makes it a little more work for you. Make 
&gt;sure you hang on to one of the ones that works the best for you.
&gt;
&gt;   I am still waiting for my tandem bike pics LOL

&gt;   Winter vacation over! Not really a vacation, but the school district 
&gt;closes
&gt;down for the holidays, plus the added snow days!! I have the two proto 
&gt;types
&gt;boards complete, and funtional, at least as far as the individual sections
&gt;go, now to test them in sessions. I must be getting older, cuz this stuff
&gt;seems to take me forever anymore. I kept the shortwave converter, and I
&gt;think I have a version that works better. I think I&#x27;ll order three more of
&gt;the micro boards, and combine those with home made radios to get some more
&gt;systems put together quicker. I had three systems that I made using all
&gt;surface mount components, and they were the most stable systems so far, and
&gt;the most compact. I gave the first ones away, DOH!
