 The same old shiesola. Post stuff that should draw comments and discussions, like the pictures posted last night, but no, the discussion is on how dishonest some pro psyhic is, and how foolish I am to watch her on Montel's show. 
 
 I did a second test with the larger TV, and got images that were like full size, some larger than the screen, they look like portraits, but now I think the group in not the place present them. Most would prefer to discuss some trivial POS, or some whispery noise that just has to be a voice if it can just be filtered enough! Y'all wonder why I get fed up and quit the damn group! God Almighty!!
