Thanks Bruce. My w=
ish is that we had unlimited posting/filing space. But til then we will hav=
e to make do with what we have. Try the esnips thing out several of us are =
already over there forming our lil community for file sharing. With 50 gigs=
 you can pretty much post in whatever format you like which is what we do. =
Some files are just too large to post here or too many of them to post all =
at once so we just use that instead.
 
Plus its easy to link up with others=
 so that they get notifications you have uploaded a new file. I think for n=
ow its a great way to expand our group and possibly even reach more people =
who havent joined here or even heard of the things we do. It also keeps a h=
it count for how many people visit your folders so you can see what people =
are listening to. And it allows comments so that visitors can give feedback=
 if they wish.
