<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Snowfire,

So did the police check based on your communication? Around here they think anyone that has a tip must be a suspect.

I apologize. I saw that so many people addressed you as &quot;Snow&quot; that I thought it was fine with you. It was not meant as a slight or disrespect in any way. Please address me as &quot;Draiga&quot; not &quot;Dra&quot;.

Thank you,
~Draiga

&gt;  Thank you Dra, I still have many other&#x27;s I did it on the first day the Annie became missing, I called police on the second day they found her body about 8 or 9 days later in a wall at the science tech area of the school, I let the police hear all my files, but of course police thought I was in some bar and all the people were talking about the missing girl.  The cop on the line said, &quot;well, it&#x27;s only been one day, and we hope we find her alive.&quot;  Just what he said, so I did feel badly because spirit told them she was already dead.  I&#x27;m glad i saved all the files, i have even the originals too. that was before i knew how to change them to mp so they are still in wav format.  This is the real thing people, and it&#x27;s not only Coke either! sf
