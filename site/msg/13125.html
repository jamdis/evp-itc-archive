<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just to update and share some information I provide the following...  
As many of you know, I have asked 8 ITC researchers to assist me with 
an ITC session involving plane crash debris.  I sent those 8 
researchers an envelope containing the debris and asked them to use it 
in five, 30 second sessions and send me the audio files.  I gave them 
no detailed information, except that it was a commercial plane crash to 
keep the sessions more controlled.
Today I received the first of the audio files from one of those 
researchers.  After listening to his third file, my jaw dropped after 
hearing what I did.
This is very promising, and I hope to get additional relivant files 
from the other researchers.
I&#x27;ll be sharing all the details in the video I&#x27;ll be putting on my 
Youtube page early next year.

Thanks to all of you who are participating!
