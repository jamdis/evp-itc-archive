So were you able to \ndetermine which envoronmental change caused the voice/amswer? \n\n\n F-S\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, leongbabe@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Rees,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I just got my paranormal puck a couple of days ago and in regular  \npeople \n&gt; terms, it takes readings from the environment:  EMF  (man-made and \nnatural), \n&gt; voltage, frequency, and temperature, and  translate those readings \ninto words from \n&gt; a 2,000 word dictionary.  It also  logs all the readings on a \nspreadsheet.  \n&gt; You can also set alarms and  threshholds for spikes, and well as \nincorporate a \n&gt; PC camera or audio device to  record pictures, video or audio \nwhenever your \n&gt; alarms are reached.  It&#39;s a  very interesting device.  One of the \nfirst \n&gt; questions I asked it was  &quot;Who are you?&quot;  It answered &quot;Edison, \nreincarnation&quot;.   I \n&gt; brought  it to a meeting today of the group I belong to, the San \nFrancisco Ghost \n&gt; Society,  and when our resident psychic asked it &quot;What&#39;s my \nname?&quot;  It replied \n&gt; with  the word &quot;Medium&quot;.  Like I said, it&#39;s a very interesting \ndevice,  \n&gt; indeed!  The inventor refers to the device not as an ITC device, \nbut  rather, a ECM \n&gt; device -- for Environmental Communications Mode, as it is driven  \npurely from \n&gt; environmental data alone.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Sharon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **************Need a new ride?
