I hope you mean the recording off the rare recording site. I downloaded it for you and put it thru. Lots of results some relevant some not. Many female voices as well came back. I will upload the results in 3 parts because theres just too many for ya to post as one attachment.

      Misty--OMG. This is amazing. What live recordings did you feed into EVPMaker?    

  I wonder if working with their own voice in EVPmaker makes it easier for them to construct an EVP? These are some of the clearest EVP through EVPmaker that I have ever heard. I am really astounded.

    These are from a few days ago (attached to this post for new members you need to set status to "individual email" setting for the group to get attachments). I decided since I downloaded some of Edison's historical speech to compare to my evp voice that I wondered what I would get if I threw one of those into evpmaker. I got a little more than I thought I would. It even made me have to google to look up the meaning of one of the technical words LOL
   
  I also included the evp vs life speech side by side comparison with the evp I got from ST method. Since thats how this started and for those who just joined group and have no idea what I am talkin about.
