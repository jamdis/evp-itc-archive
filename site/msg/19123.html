<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Feedback is the big problem with the internal echo chamber. For a while I
was leaving out the echo chamber, but trying to provide external chambers
was a problem too, it makes the box less portable. The chamber adds
&quot;something&quot;, kinda like a filter, plus &quot;they&quot; seems to be able to make their
voices easier. Usually I can drill holes in the cabinet to relive the
feedback, with this box I had to seal the whole thing with silicone. I had a
better seal between the battery compartment and the main compartment, so I
guess sound was finding other ways to interact.

 The chamber speaker is less than an inch in diameter, and the mic just a
standard electret.  I use three tubes, instead of the two shown in the
diagram so I can get more separation. The larger the chamber the more
pronounced the enhancement effect, the voices are almost scary. I made one
once that was 12 inch by 48 inch MDF board lined with aluminum foil with
crystals and magnets glued on the insides, OMG  I had to take to it apart!
That was frikkin&#x27; demonic.

 That&#x27;s one reason I don&#x27;t have a fixed design, there&#x27;s just too much to
this.

&gt; It is a simple concept as to why the vents cut down on feedback.  As a
&gt; former live sound engineer, feedback was quite the nemesis.
&gt;
&gt; If I remember reading right, you have a small microphone and a small
&gt; speaker in your &quot;echo chamber.&quot;  A feedback loop happens when a speaker
&gt; produces audio and a microphone pics that audio up.  The thing is, if the
&gt; speaker and microphone are not far enough apart from one another, a feedback
&gt; loop occurs where the audio loop between microphone to speaker keeps
&gt; building up and frequencies start to converge into feedback.
&gt;
&gt; Considering that your echo chamber is right under the batteries, the
&gt; microphone in the echo chamber is probably picking up the audio from the
&gt; main speaker output at the same time as the output that is in the echo
&gt; chamber.  The two sources picked up at the same time is causing the
&gt; feedback.   By venting the battery chamber, the soundwaves from the main
&gt; speaker  are being released easier from the hollow design of the box.  This
&gt; allows for the natural reverberation caused by speaker output to stop
&gt; reverberating around inside the box, it is this bouncing around of audio
&gt; that is= eventually picked up by your echo chamber microphone at the same
&gt; time and becomes feedback.
&gt;
&gt; The same thing happens during a concert when a performer gets his
&gt; microphone to close to the floor monitor.  A feedback loop occurs because
&gt; the singer hear&#x27;s his voice in the floor monitor at the same time as it is
&gt; coming out of his mouth.  A loop occurs where the frequencies build upon
&gt; each other and feedback happens.  In your case, the microphone inside the
&gt; echo chamber is simply picking up the main speaker at the same time as the
&gt; speaker in your echo box, causing the same audio pattern.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps,
&gt;

&gt;&gt; The battery box is on top of the echo chamber, and venting the door helps
&gt;&gt; cut the feedback for some weird acoustical reason. The new box should be
&gt;&gt; &quot;92&quot; doh!

Feedback is he big p oblem wi h  he in e nal echo chambe . Fo a while I was lea ing ou he echo chambe , bu ying o p o ide ex e nal chambe s was a p oblem oo, i makes he box less po able. The chambe adds &quot;some hing&quot;, kinda like a il e , plus &quot; hey&quot; seems o be able o make hei oices easie . Usually I can d ill holes in he cabine o eli e he eedback, wi h his box I had o seal he whole hing wi h silicone. I had a be e seal be ween he ba e y compa men and he main compa men , so I guess sound was inding o he ways o in e ac .

I is a simple concep as o why he en s cu down on eedback.  As a o me li e sound enginee , eedback was qui e he nemesis.   

I I emembe eading igh , you ha e a small mic ophone and a small speake in you &quot;echo chambe .&quot;  A eedback loop happens when a speake p oduces audio and a mic ophone pics ha audio up.  The hing is, i he speake and mic ophone a e no a enough apa om one ano he , a eedback loop occu s whe e he audio loop be ween mic ophone o speake keeps building up and equencies s a o con e ge in o eedback.  


Conside ing ha you echo chambe is igh unde he ba e ies, he mic ophone in he echo chambe is p obably picking up he audio om he main speake ou pu a he same ime as he ou pu ha is in he echo chambe .  The wo sou ces picked up a he same ime is causing he eedback.   By en ing he ba e y chambe , he soundwa es om he main speake  a e being eleased easie om he hollow design o he box.  This allows o he na u al e e be a ion caused by speake ou pu o s op e e be a ing a ound inside he box, i is his bouncing a ound o audio ha is= e en ually picked up by you echo chambe mic ophone a he same ime and becomes eedback.


The same hing happens du ing a conce when a pe o me ge s his mic ophone o close o he loo moni o .  A eedback loop occu s because he singe hea &#x27;s his oice in he loo moni o a he same ime as i is coming ou o his mou h.  A loop occu s whe e he equencies build upon each o he and eedback happens.  In you case, he mic ophone inside he echo chambe is simply picking up he main speake a he same ime as he speake in you echo box, causing he same audio pa e n.


Hope his helps,
