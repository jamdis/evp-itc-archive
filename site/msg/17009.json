Could\nhe have rigged it?? Sure, but if he did, I would have expected it to be\nbetter then what it was. We heard just a single little squeal. Nothing at\nall after that. This happened right after he had been talking aloud to\n&quot;Jackie&quot; telling her we had her mother there (which I thought was cruel).\n\nI would think that if he was going to rig it, he would have done more than\njust that. So while I have to be skeptical of the incident because I have no\nother proof to go with it, I am leaning towards it being a real sound not\nperpetrated by him.\n\n\nOn Thu, Apr 22, 2010 at 9:52 AM, John S &lt;phenom_investigator@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I think I can help on the Queen Mary stuff. The late Peter James actually\n&gt; became well-known because he facilitated the production of the audible\n&gt; voice of the little girl known to him (and the rest of the world) as\n&gt; &quot;Jackie.&quot;\n&gt; This recording, not an EVP, became for many clear evidence that the\n&gt; little girl was quite real. Many people, including some known personally\n&gt; to me, claim to have seen this little girl and others in the First Class\n&gt; Pool\n&gt; area. This story goes back many years before Disney had anything to do\n&gt; with the Queen Mary, so I think it is correct to say that myth is wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  ------------------------------\n&gt;     Date: Wed Apr 21, 2010 12:50 pm ((PDT))\n&gt;\n&gt;   Yeah, that was from me(Frank). Yeah that helps, at least you&#39;re not just\n&gt; some brainiac debunker that knows it all cuz he says so.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, I find it very difficult to get absolutes with this work, as the\n&gt; mind has a hell of lot to do with it. An example, I started out using a\n&gt; randiom voltage to sweep the radios becuase I was using EVPmaker previous\n&gt; to\n&gt; making boxes, and EVPmaker uses a method of chopping up the raw audio, and\n&gt; playing it back for use by the enities. When I first swtiched to a linear\n&gt; sweep all I couyld hear was gibberish, then very suddenly I hear hear\n&gt; &quot;them&quot;\n&gt; talking on my fisrt linear sweep box. So did it take &quot;them&quot; time to adapt,\n&gt; or did it take my brain to make sense out of the gibberish.\n&gt;\n&gt; For me, I don&#39;t care which it is, I think it&#39;s valid either way. If it is\n&gt; only the mind creating the messages you hear, which I doubt because others\n&gt; can hear alot of this stuff, then I think it&#39;s still being used as a\n&gt; psychic\n&gt; prop and the information is valid.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then there&#39;s the probelm of expectations, if you test this stuff in a lab,\n&gt; I think you&#39;ll limit your results, and get whatever is expected. If you&#39;r\n&gt; expecting evidence of a haunting, that&#39;s what you get. I was on the Queen\n&gt; mary last fall, in the pool area there is supposedly a littlegirl stuck\n&gt; there and you can get all the EVPs, and  EMF readings and interactions to\n&gt; verify it, but that story (I heard) was started by Disney to bring in\n&gt; tourists. There were some that claimed to &quot;corss over&quot; hundreds of souls on\n&gt; the QM, so why is the QM still haunted?  I don&#39;t go the &quot;haunted areas&quot; to\n&gt; record.\n&gt;\n&gt; I get voices like this, which seem to be pretty much ignored if it doesn&#39;t\n&gt; fit the ghost hunter expectation, but it shows how broadcast fragment are\n&gt; manipulated.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s not all cut and dried, and can be vary complicated.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, Apr 21, 2010 at 12:34 PM, John S &lt;phenom_investigator@...\n&gt; &gt;wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I don&#39;t know if Frank&#39;s question regarding experience was to myself or\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; Dwayne.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In case it was to me, here is a brief summary of my work.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have been involved with Parapsychology research for about 4 decades.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; During that time I have conducted experiments in ESP and PK including\n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; groundbreaking research on real-time PK and remote PK studies with gifted\n&gt; &gt; subjects.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have also conducted quite a bit of research on mediumship, theories of\n&gt; &gt; survival,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; EVP as a matter of fact and the belief systems which seem to contribute\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; all of this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Ouija work was an outgrowth of the PK research involving several test\n&gt; &gt; groups.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; While I don&#39;t argue for a specific interpretation of any ability or\n&gt; &gt; phenomenon,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I do think it&#39;s important to offer what is known from Parapsychology lab\n&gt; &gt; research.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is far from any form of &#39;debunking per se. Rather it is an attempt\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; to offer an explanation grounded at least in some careful studies.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That explanation is still anomalous; it is not something that would make\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; a skeptic very happy. But it is at least based on repeated tests which\n&gt; seem\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; to show outcomes consistent with predictions -  the basis of experimental\n&gt; &gt; technique.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hope that helps clarify things a bit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 1 of 1 File(s)\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/attachments/folder/1561106683/item/list\n&gt;\n&gt; --TheCompleteNaturalWayToLearn--Sex.mp3\n&gt;\n&gt; Messages in this topic (15)\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; 2.
