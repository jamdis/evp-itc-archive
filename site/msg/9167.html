Hi Margaret 
   
  Yes I saw what Frank and Bruce wrote I am taking it all in, trying to figure the best way to handle this. I know some are opposed to doing anything and some are for it. And of course being a newbie to both the group and evps I respect what everyone has to say. 
   
  Think I am going to sleep on it and look more into it tomorrow. And as a group figure out what is best for all.  I think I personally got caught up in the hype of seeing someone sticking it to so many people.

  Hi Kay. Just wanting to make sure you saw Frank's post. His concern being that we might 
wipe out the 12-469 availability. Maybe you could mention all the models, or none of 
them (just be more generic in the ad). This way, people can be drawn to one model or 
another naturally, rather than being guided toward the 12-469 (which honestly, I think the 
click-click-clicking on the new version is a distraction). 

If I were to start from scratch, looking at all the choices, I would have gone with the 12-
820 first. It's great that additional models have been discovered to be hackable. Thanks 
much to those who have brought this information to our attention!
