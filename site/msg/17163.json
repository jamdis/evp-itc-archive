For the past couple years I&#39;ve been using\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mostly what I call direct mode, or no echo chamber. When I use an\n&gt; &gt; aluminum\n&gt; &gt; &gt; foil chamber I seem to get more ET types, and that&#39;s what I used to get\n&gt; &gt; &quot;we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; come from the 6th planet&quot; years ago.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A very large echo chamber can have a dramatic effect, like 12 inches\n&gt; &gt; &gt; square, and 4 feet long. I made one that size out of MDF board and lined\n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wiht aluminum foil, the voices were so demonic sounding that I took it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; apart. Later I found that if something works, you tend to get the\n&gt; &gt; negative\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guys to try to scare you away from it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; F-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Sat, May 15, 2010 at 8:33 PM, &lt;dc3644@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So in building a Frank&#39;s Box is it essential to use an echo chamber?\n&gt; &gt; And if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so, how come?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dwayne Claud\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In a message dated 5/15/2010 12:15:54 A.M.
