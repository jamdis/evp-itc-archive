Im sure it can be used effectively to \ncommunicate, but anything can be used to communicate effictively as \nlong as you stay objective and dont read too much into some things. \nSo I was just suggesting if you have an emf detector already or other \nthings available why buy something which is pretty much the same \nthing you have already. Ive noted that some electronic toys work very \nwell if there really is someone on the other side wanting to make \ncontact badly enough. For instance right now I live in a brand new \napartment building.\n    We just recently got rid of our house and moved into an apartment \nto save some money up. Usually I start wondering about the history of \na house or an apartment when I first move in. Considering though this \nbuilding and everything in it or on it are brand new as the building \nwas just put up and we were the very first couple to live in this \napartment. Which is a pretty cool fresh feeling, to be the first \npeople to live in a place. So it never even ocurred to me to think \nabout its history, since it has no history. Never-the-less after \nabout 2 months of living there I start feeling things. Like Im being \nwatched. It slowly progresses to actually seeing things out of the \ncorner of my eyes, I shrug this off too. Then I actually seen a cat \nin my apartment it starts to come up to me, I kept my eyes on it \nnonstop and it just vanished right in front of me. I really thought \nthat was the last straw I no doubt lost my mind.\n   Its not like I thought I saw it, its like it was really there then \nas it comes up to me it just vanishes. It looked completely solid, I \nthought how the heck did a stray cat get in my apartment. The same \nthing happened later but with a person, I was coming from the kitchen \nand seen a person walk down the hallway I run quickly to the hallway \nand nothing. I told my fiance about the cat, I didnt say nothing \nabout the person because I dont want her to think Im crazy. The odd \nthing was that just the other day she said she seen some kind of \nanimal run through our living room , when she went to find out what \nit was it was gone. Her experience was a bit different as she seen it \ncut in front of a doorway. I was standing in front of it and seen it \njust evaporate in front of my eyes. Anyway long story short I toy \nwent off on its own across the room while holding my 4 month old \ndaughter in my lap. (its an electronic toy with no remote control or \nmotion sensor, you actually have to hit a button to set it off, so \nhow it went off with no button being pressed was beyond me). So I \nsaid if there is anyone here set that toy off again, and sure enough \nwithin a second or less of my asking it did it again.\n    I asked if it can understand what Im saying to do it twice, and \nit did. By that time I was really intrigued and freaked out to say \nthe least. I scrambled to find my video camera and it didnt do it \nwhile taping. I thought perhaps low batteries like some would \nsuggest. Anyway feeling discouraged I went to the restroom and I can \nhear that toy go off again. Then as Im wondering if it might be that \ntoys batters another toy in the living room starts to go off along \nwith the first toy. How this is going on in a freshly built place \nwhere there has not been a house built on the same location before is \nbeyond me, a portion of trees had to be cleared for these apartments. \nPerhaps the land itself, or a nearby house since there are a few from \nline of sight, no way for me to tell I guess. I completely lost track \nof my point, but there you have it.\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Ratka &lt;warrior18eii@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Okay, its just an inexpensive EM meter. The ELF/VLF detection range \nposses a problem in that it will detect human speech and giving false \npositives.

I have to say that it is a very affordable meter and very \nrugged.  I am by no means a professional in this field, but I have to \nsay that it is by far one of the most useful pieces I carry.

Measure the EMF (Electro \nmagnetic Field) strength of every electrical device in your home, \nworkplace or school; outdoor power lines, underground lines and even \nwhen you travel and shop for appliances. Health concerns about the \nnegative effects of ELECTRO MAGNETIC FIELDS (EMF) from appliances, \npower lines, and home wiring have caused the U.S. Government to issue \na warning to use &quot;Prudent Avoidance&quot; to help reduce your exposure to \nthis risk.   Since EMF&#39;s are everywhere it may be impossible to \ntotally avoid them.  The SAFE RANGE EMF METER from K-II can help you \nmeasure these\n&gt;  potentially harmful fields and determine the safe range to help \nreduce exposure. It also helps you determine which appliances produce \nhigh level emissions.\n&gt; \n&gt;         \n&gt;   \n&gt;     \n&gt;   FEATURES INCLUDE:                \n&gt;   \n&gt;     \n&gt;   Easy to read LED Display    \n&gt;     \n&gt;   50\n&gt;  & 60 Hz operation    \n&gt;     \n&gt;   Five level milliGauss ranges    \n&gt;     \n&gt;   For indoor and outdoor use     \n&gt;     \n&gt;   Durable plastic case          \n&gt;   \n&gt;   \n&gt;     \n&gt;   Operates for months on a single 9V battery  \n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;   Detects the ELF range (50 to 1,000Hz) & VLF range (1,000 to \n20,000Hz)\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank Ratka &lt;warrior18eii@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:           I \nhaven&#39;t &quot;played&quot; with one of these yet.

I have had one for a while now, and let me be the \nfirst to say that it works.  I have had numerous two way \nconversations using it, as well as captured video evidence of these \nconversations showing that there is nothing around capable of giving \noff an EMF.  The only issue that I have concern with is unlike EVP \nwork or video ITC work you have no recognizable\n&gt;  voice or image to positively correlate who the communication is \ncoming from.  In my case, I might ask the question &quot;Are you Sylvia, \nmy mother, show me two spikes for yes and one spike for no&quot; and the \nmeter will spike twice for yes, but I have no voice or image I would \nrecognize to verify that is who is causing the meter to spike.  The \nmeter is a very useful tool and I do not conduct an investigation or \nsession without it by my side, but like the rest of the tools in this \nfield it has its valuable points as well as negative points. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Lynn \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@ hotmail.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;       \n&gt; I saw on Ghost Hunters last night that they were using a &quot;K2 Meter&quot; \nto get yes-no answers from the unseen.
