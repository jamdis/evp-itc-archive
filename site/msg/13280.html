<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am glad you finished the video Mike! I enjoyed getting to hear what
everyone else sent in, as well as what your results were. I am curious
as to whether or not you got full participation once you sent out the
debris. Did everyone follow your instructions? Did you get files from
everyone you send debris to? Did you get better or worse results than
you expected? Would you attempt something like this again?

I was very excited to participate in the research and am planning on
doing more with the debris in the future. Just wanted to say &quot;thanks&quot;
and keep up the great work. I think your experiments and willingness
to share your work are a shining example to all in the paranormal field.

I hope everyone enjoyed this as much as I did. I plan on doing a write
up on our website about the experiment in the near future. I&#x27;d like to
hear from the other researchers on their experience with this project...</pre>
