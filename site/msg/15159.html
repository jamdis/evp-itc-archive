It means that he caught evidence of paranormal phenomena, and that is good =
enough for me.

  It goes without saying that if everything is as he s=
ays, then it is pretty good evidence.

  Paranormal means beyond normal. It=
 means it can't be explain by normal means.

        Interesting topic!

  =
      BTW that investigation was at the former Manteno State Mental Hospita=
l. It included the amazing "It's Harold Wing" EVP I got. None of the people=
 doing the investigation there had ever heard of Harold Wing. Upon later ex=
amination of old records, it was found that Harold Wing was actually a pati=
ent who died there of typhoid fever in 1938. But we didn't find that out un=
til weeks later.

        How do you explain that conventionally?

            There's another possibility: possibly the spirits=
 involved only wish to impart sounds to a particular unit or units.

      There could be several reasons, and it's only conjecture without comp=
