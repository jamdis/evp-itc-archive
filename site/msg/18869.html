&gt; It&#x27;s actually not a book, it&#x27;s a Ph.D. thesis done under John Archibald
&gt; Wheeler at Princeton. It does not imply that there is no objective reality.
&gt; I guess you have to know a lot about physics to really understand what it&#x27;s
&gt; saying. And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a perfect theory, either. It has flaws, as
&gt; all of them seem to.

&gt; &gt; I never read that book, but if what it is implying is what I think it is...
&gt; &gt; that there is no objective reality... then that is very scary to me, and
&gt; &gt; hard to accept. A pill I can swallow if I must, but would rather not until I
&gt; &gt; have to... perhaps I should read that book :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; To put it very simply, the universe is the sum of the observations of
&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone in it. The Schrodinger wave equation never collapses.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have been silent out of fear. Sometimes the ridicule gets hard to
&gt; &gt; take. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know that sometimes mind does influence perception of reality. The
&gt; &gt; other day
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was brought back to quantum physics. They talk of an observer and how
&gt; &gt; just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the observer being there can change things. I was thinking it is like
&gt; &gt; when I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sing. I sing much better when I am alone than when I think someone can
&gt; &gt; hear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me.
