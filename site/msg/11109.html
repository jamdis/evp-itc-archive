Hi Ralph,
 
My sister and I were also in Gettysburg last November and she captured an  
apparition in infrared with her digital camera in the middle of the Triangular  
Field.  We also captured some strange otherworldly sounds in the  Wheatfield.  
As to your EVPs captured in the men's room, in my  opinion, the Lucifer EVP 
should be regarded with a bit of  suspicion because unless the statement could 
be concretely substantiated  using conventional scientific methods currently 
at our disposal, there's no  way to determine the veracity of such statements.  
However, the very  statement itself is negative in nature (insofar as we're 
not devil worshippers),  and I will be cautious in conducting any more EVPs in 
the men's room because it  sounds like the spirit(s) is pulling your leg.  
 
Just my opinion, 
Sharon
