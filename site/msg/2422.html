A trip=
 to the vet will answer that question, usually most breaks can be set unles=
s there is another underlying problem. It is a cute lil dog, sometimes they=
 are very fragile bone structures because of breeding. There are a few smal=
l dogs that seem to have alot of problems with bad backs and breaking legs/=
feet. 

 

I think its proof to those who want it, and as for me...nobody i=
s talking about me on the radio, or using my full name...so it definitely g=
ets my attention when my name is being used in context with things that are=
 going on around me or happening to people I know.

 

I dont need any proo=
f, they just give it freely so I can share or in some cases not share with =
everyone.

 

I stopped lookin for proof right about the time this all star=
ted. My first evp was all that I needed to get me on this path. My mothers =
voice, so long after shes been passed, friends, relatives, or even perfect =
strangers who I had no clue about until I found out after the fact....way t=
oo many proofs have been freely given to me, and I never asked for one. Ear=
l and Bob Cox, I think thats one of my favorite WOW moments, not knowing ab=
out Erland Babcock it was an easy misunderstanding. Luckily I make everythi=
ng phonetic so it was easy to catch later. I have listened to others evp fr=
om him since then and I often STILL hear earl and bob cox. They have also g=
iven me names of workers on this side who I have bumped into later tho I us=
ually put off contacting anyone they mention until I think the time is righ=
t. Usually it is just weird to find out its a REAL LIVE person and that the=
y just happen to be in the EVP/ITC field. 

 

I used to always assume when=
 they say a name they are talking about spirits there. Or that if I get an =
ITC image its a spirit face. They proved thats a wrong assumption on severa=
l occasions. Probably the only time I ever asked for anything was while doi=
ng an itc session, after so many faces I just wanted them to show me someth=
ing else, anything else, "show me something different" led to a few portrai=
ts of the living.

 

Sometimes they speak the truth, sometimes a wayward t=
hought creeps threw that shouldnt (or just a creep)... as for the dog...tak=
e it to the vet and see what they can do then you will know more.
