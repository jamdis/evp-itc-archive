I have tried Goldwave a few times. But couldn&#39;t remember the features. The High or Low pass filters are very helpfull. As well as the pitch (this changes the voice either higher or lower) that helps bring it out of the &quot;muddy&quot; static level. As far as using the &quot;noise eliminator&quot; be careful here...a little goes a long way. It will make you audio sound like a bad organ piano :) The high or low filter actually does what we are wanting the noise filter to do anyway. And doesn&#39;t add its own melodies. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;April Abercrombie&quot; &lt;april@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Goldwave can do those things too.

Has option to slow the recording down. Another nice feature is that you can use either a highpass or lowpass filter (sometimes that is all that is needed) and changing the PITCH is a very handy tool. Always KEEP an original copy of your recordings. I just save a copy from inside audacity (to desktop or somewhere) then I will start my work on trying to clear it up. Save the original (and proceeding enhanced version(s) by using the &quot;file&quot; button at to left corner oif program. There you would SAVE &quot;selection&quot; as MP3.(To upload to here) or save to WAV (is bigger) but higher qulity. Can always convert the wav to mp3 from withing audacity also. *you will need to get the mps &quot;pluging&quot; from the website, and follow the information to install it &quot;manually&quot; (once is only needed) that way you get the mp3 converter program free. But really...Audacity is a pretty good program to have round. Has a nice &quot;undo&quot; fesature too, if you make a mistake.

If you have to have high quality \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; devices \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; to make it out, it just isn&#39;t good enough.

Even so, if I am trying to \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; remain unbiased and objective, there is no way for me to say this is a \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; spirit, \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; without personally being with you when you caught it.

Sometimes I could sort of hear \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; something \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; that sort of sounded like what you suggested, but I could also hear it \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; in \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; other ways, or not at all.\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So my suggestion to you, if you want to get less subjective \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; conjuctures \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; or simply less affirmations of your own interpretations, is to post the \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; future ones without labels. The labels you give can influence the \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; listeners: \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; when you have a sound that could be several things, and you note that it \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; sounded like &quot;keep it moving&quot;, the listener can find it nearly \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; impossible to \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; try NOT to hear what you heard, and so not be able to give a fresh \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; perspecive to help your research methods. \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroup --- In _EVP-IT_EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) ) , \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;James W.

I said 16 (my earlier age I was saying in \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; recorder) \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; and the male evp said 13....then a female laughs. All this was missed by \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; the DR60 (except my 16 was recorded in both recorders) Go to my Folder \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; in \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; the files section &quot;Jim&#39;s RR-DR60 EVP&#39;s&quot; andic&quot; microphone also \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; (something to \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; do with those low &quot;booms&quot; that I have noticed lead or follow many \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; evp&#39;s). \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; So I look forward to any ideas.
