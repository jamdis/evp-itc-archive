I have used an older radio for a manual sweping \nmethod that is made up of tubes and it gives it a nice sound different \nthan a transistor radio.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;windsymph&quot; &lt;arrius@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  I am in search of a few answers pertaining to Franks Box. Can anyone \n&gt; direct me to a schematic inclusive of instructions as to the design \nof \n&gt; a Franks Box. Secondly I as to the am band units, can they only be \n&gt; devised and constrcuted with transistor circuits only or can the \n&gt; technique be applied to older tube sets as well?? I ask only because \nI \n&gt; would like to test some theories and thoughts. My sincere thanks to \nall \n&gt; for your time and replies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Arrius\n&gt;"}
