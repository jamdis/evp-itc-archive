Tonight at work I was talking to a state trooper, there had been an acciden=
t. I asked him if there were any deaths (it was very very bad) and he said =
he didnt know so he got on his radio and called in and asked them if it was=
 a 7 at the site. They told him negative, and he told me the little boy who=
 was the worst off was still alive. I asked him why did you ask them if it =
was a 7. He said code 7, I was asking them if they were dead. So if you eve=
r hear anyone call 7 over the radio that means someones dead.
=A0
Just thou=
ght I would pass that on. I find it interesting since I know alot of us hav=
e heard this before when used to describe who is speaking rather than a nam=
e they say seven.
