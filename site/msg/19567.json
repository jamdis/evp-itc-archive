It makes so\n&gt; much sense to me and if it works as suggested will allow our depth of\n&gt; communication to extend so much further than it has prior to this...almost\n&gt; like a conscious mind (GBC, surface messages) and the subconscious mind\n&gt; (sound/audio imaging and everything that lies beneath the surface) sort of\n&gt; thing.\n&gt;\n&gt; I really get a good, STRONG feeling about this.
