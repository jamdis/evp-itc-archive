<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Aaron,

I can&#x27;t remember the versions, but 1.0 does have a Play List - this is
the version I&#x27;m using.

You can also google for &quot;Cool Edit 2000&quot; or &quot;Cool Edit Pro&quot; which both
have Cue List and Play List (these are the predecessors of Audition
before Syntrillium was swallowed by Adobe). If you (or anyone else) have
difficulties to find a downloadable version of Cool Edit 2000, e-mail me.

&gt; Stefan,

&gt; Do you know which versions do have the Play List? I can see if I can find an
&gt; older demo that is available. I&#x27;m not familar with Audition. I&#x27;ve mostly
&gt; used Audacity for everything.

&gt;&gt;   Hi Aaron,

&gt;&gt; &gt; Stefan/Ron L.: That definately does sound like a good idea. I will
&gt;&gt; &gt; see if I can try that. Maybe when I get home, I will see if I can
&gt;&gt; &gt; copy and paste the text that is supposed to be read to the group. If
&gt;&gt; &gt; I can, anybody that can help in synthesizing the allophones to read
&gt;&gt; &gt; the text, that would be a great help. To do that you have to have
&gt;&gt; &gt; Adobe Audition correct? Or is there anything else you can use/build?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Adobe Audition or Cool Edit. However, I have read that the newer
&gt;&gt; versions of Audition don&#x27;t have a Play List anymore. But instead of
&gt;&gt; using the Play List, the individual allophones can also be combined by
&gt;&gt; using &quot;copy and paste&quot;.
