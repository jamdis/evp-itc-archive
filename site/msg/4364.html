Just from my viewpoint. So far these are relatively both new systems. They both have the function and capability for sweep tuning and they both have had good results when tested.
   
  If you are into modifying, arent scared of soldering (if all the wires pop off LOL)...I'd try the RS hack first simply because you cant beat the price. If you cant locate one to modify or no clue what to do if its one of those different models that has extra wires/different pins etc... may wanna plunk down the cash for the mini.
   
  The guys suggest the rs 12-470 older version. Some of the 469's have a clicking noise which bug some people. It's pretty much up to the individual and which choice is right for them. Plenty of methods to choose from.
