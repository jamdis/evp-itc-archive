Re: [EVP-ITC] Nothin'!




Your right Frank, it all depends on expectations=
 and what degree of proof it will take for someone to accept the existence =
of the beyond and the entities who reside there. People all over the world =
scream for proof but yet if you ask them they cannot define what criteria t=
hey require for proof. Why? Because they are so brainwashed in our societie=
s materialistic teachings they never expect to receive proof, so they don't=
 even bother to define such a criteria.Its amazing to me that a primarily s=
piritual creature such as ourselves can deny our connections with that worl=
d and the source. The connections we experience everyday and at all times i=
n the form of dreams, random thoughts and inspirations are so easily taken =
for granted and written off as figments of imagination, trivial thoughts an=
d meaningless aspirations. Even as a child I knew I was unique as was every=
 person on the face of the planet. I knew that their were as many perspecti=
ves of reality as their were people to have them and that each and every on=
e of them were just as valid as the other no matter how outlandish it seeme=
d to me.Acceptance was taught to me instead of beliefs. Beliefs can enhance=
 the truth but they are not in themselves true.More than I expected to writ=
e but I feel it is still valid,Best regards,Frank R.
