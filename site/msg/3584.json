The one built in \nAug 2006 with a date code of 08A06.  Radio Shack now has a newer \nversion of the 12-470 that is showing up in some stores.  As of this \ntime, no modification has been found for the newer version, date code \nof 06A07 (June 2007) (Black case). If you plan to modify a 12-470 make \nsure you buy the older version (Gray and white case) which can be seen \nin my video at www.ufogeek.com\nThe newer 12-470 looks similar to the 12-469 in style, except the 12-\n470 is black, has a speaker, and a green ring around the button on the \nfront; where the 12-469 is white, has no speaker and a blue ring around \nthe button on the front.\nThe older 12-470 is gray and white, with three silver button on the \nfront where the speaker is located. I&#39;m assuming all the older versions \nof the 12-470 can be modified, but that is just an assumption.  They \nchanged the circuit boards on the newer version of the 12-470 and there \nis no wire bundle lke in the older version."}
