Others receive \n&gt; what \n&gt; &gt; they are to receive, for a purpose. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It will all wash out in the end, Purple Princess of the \nSeven.  :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption \n&lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_St_Germain &#39;Saint \n&gt; &gt; Germain is always associated with the color violet, the jewel \n&gt; &gt; amethyst, and the Maltese cross rendered in violet (usually the \n&gt; iron \n&gt; &gt; cross style cross patee version); he is also regarded as \n&gt; the &#39;Chohan \n&gt; &gt; of the Seventh Ray&#39;[13]  according to Theosophy, the Seven Rays \n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; seven metaphysical principles that govern both individual souls \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; the unfolding of each 2,158 year long Astrological Age. Since \n&gt; &gt; according to Theosophy the next Astrological Age, the Age of \n&gt; &gt; Aquarius, will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) Ray (the Ray \nof \n&gt; &gt; Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes called &#39;The \nHierarch \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; the Age of Aquarius&#39;. According to the Ascended Master \nTeachings, \n&gt; &gt; Saint Germain is &#39;The God of Freedom for the Earth&#39;.&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Much to do with the Purple Princess, and the seven. I don&#39;t \n&gt; mean \n&gt; &gt; to sell others short, I just get a different level, and find \n&gt; &gt; regular &quot;this your auntie&quot; type EVPs kinda useless. Mostly I \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; post every voice I get, just the ones that I thought was \n&gt; outstanding, \n&gt; &gt; but no one else hears.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n_________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Make i&#39;m yours.
