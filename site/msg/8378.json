There \nare two different types of ITC, and various EVP (MiniBox, manual radio sweep, traditional, \nPortuguese crowd babble, etc.)  The files are pretty small, so I&#39;m not hogging up a lot space.\n\nI always enjoy listening to and seeing other people&#39;s examples.  I&#39;m hoping others might \nenjoy some of my examples as well, especially my water video ITC results (which as far as I \nknow, I was the first to come up with this technique).  Other people have tried it and gotten \nreally good results, so if you&#39;re looking for something new and fun to try, please give it a \nwhirl.  \n\nI really appreciate all the inspiration I&#39;ve gotten from others.  I&#39;m trying to give back a little.  \n\n:0)  Margaret"}
