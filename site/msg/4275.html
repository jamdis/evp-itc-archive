<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I wanted to edit and add the following to my previous post but... Here
is a blatant lie by Rick Moran in an obvious attempt to discredit him.
This is from the same article...

&quot;There appears to be some controversy surrounding Frank&#x27;s Box and
Christopher Moon, who is the publisher of Haunted Times Magazine, a
relative of George and Cathy Lutz of Amityville infamy...

Firstly, Christopher Moon is not now, nor will he ever be a close or
distant relative of the Lutz family. Mr. Moran lays claim to debunking
 the Amityville claims and says the entire &quot;case&quot; was a fraud. Now, he
attempts to tie Christopher Moon to the supposed fraud. 

Now remember, this is the researcher you are supporting.

&gt; A few weeks ago I posted that Rick Moran had written an article
&gt; stating that children and high school students would be part of the
&gt; testing subjects of the mini-box. Later that day the article was
&gt; replaced with a different article about the mini-box. I was told that
&gt; I was stating mis truths. I wasn&#x27;t. I finally was able to locate the
&gt; missing article. I&#x27;m providing a link to the entire article along with
&gt; the statement regarding our children. If the link somehow becomes
&gt; unavailable, I have done a screen shot and will provide it to whoever
&gt; asks.
&gt; Believe me when I say that this isn&#x27;t to cause or stir crap. I was
&gt; basically called a liar and this clears up that misconception. If I am
&gt; banned from this group for telling the truth, than so be it. 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;...it was not the question of whether the phenomenon existed to begin
&gt; with, but rather what is the phenomenon.  That will require a good
&gt; deal more effort to explore and beginning in January we will be
&gt; undertaking test sessions all over north and east Texas as well as
&gt; other national locations with a wide variety of folks to see what
&gt; happens within the group dynamic.  The testing will include folks who
&gt; are both believers and non-believers, skeptics, critics, other
&gt; researchers, children, high school students, college and grad
&gt; students, and senior citizens to name a few categories.&quot;

&gt; Are you willing to &quot;see what happens&quot; with our children?
