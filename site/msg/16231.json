We got some responses that were long sentences, all in one voice, in what sounded like Russian -- like a Russian radio station.  But I could hear the clicks as the sweep kept going.  Is it possible, if you are close to a tower or something, to pick up such a strong signal that you get long, loud complete sentences from newscasters?  (This was AM radio.)"}
