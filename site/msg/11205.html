&gt; Hi Al,
&gt; Do you know if there is a digital voice recorder that has an SD 
card slot? That would be nice to switch SD cards from time to time. 
Especially if one had a great EVP. 
&lt;rest snipped&gt;

Thought I&#x27;d jump in here...

First of all - I use mainly full spectrum sound recorders rather than 
the standard hand-held digital voice recorders. Two reasons: 1. There 
are paranormal NON-VOICE sounds out there that are not being picked 
up by the limited response of the voice-only recorders, 2. The higher 
frequencies in the 20-20 kHz human sound range contribute to the 
intelligibility of consonants. Using recorders with a higher 
frequency response makes for clearer understanding of voices - 
particularly those that are &quot;whispered&quot;.

My first foray into using full spectrum recorders led me to buy the 
(now discontinued) Fostex MR-8.

While it is not extremely portable nor hand-held, it is &quot;luggable&quot; 
and is perfect for stationary recording. It is full spectrum, battery-
powered, uses Compact Flash and has inputs for multiple external 
microphones. [The later models use hard drives for storage making 
them less rugged for field use, IMHO, and require AC power making 
them less flexible as to location.] You can find used units in good 
condition and relatively cheap on ebay. (Oh - and you can use either 
USB download or read directly off the CF for storage/analysis.) Plus 
the multiple inputs allow you to record infrsound and ultrasound on 
separate channels in synch with the human audible sound range.

For over a year now - I&#x27;ve used the Zoom H4.

Again...full spectrum, battery-operated, hand-held, uses SD storage. 
USB interface. The built-in stereo mikes are amazingly sensitive but 
the unit also has inputs for external mikes along with phantom power. 
I use it with a pair of noise-cancelling headphones and have 
definitly heard EVPs in real-time.

Zoom also has a newer model - the H2. Just as good.

The only complaint I have about the H4 is that it doesn&#x27;t have a 
lanyard (I&#x27;d hate to drop it) nor does it come with a carrying case 
(I bought a new case for a Fluke multimeter at an electronics supply 
shop which does the trick).

Hope this helps.
