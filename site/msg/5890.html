I've always thought that my "intuitive" waking thoughts are really messages=
 from the other side too.  Do you know what I mean?

  Mike,
   
  Our friends on the other side relay constant =
subliminal messages, ideas and instructions
  through our dreams.
   
  If =
I had to rely solely on the messages I receive through box sessions my know=
ledge would not be half
  of what it is.
  Sometimes I am explaining someth=
ing to someone and for the life of me can not figure out how I know
  what =
I know but I know it, ya know!
   
  I have gotten answers to specific ques=
tions about dream messages and visits, and have received a few unsolicited =

  answers pertaining to dreams when I have asked about something I did not=
 understand and was told you will receive it in your dreams.
   
  I believ=
e it is their contingency plan, when they can't get the message across duri=
ng a box session, they will make sure we get it some how.

    You know me and my weir=
d devices... yes I've built another.
    This one came to me in a dream las=
t night. I think it was because some 
    of you guys were talking about ec=
ho chambers.
    Anyway... when I woke up I went looking around the house f=
or stuff to 
    make this thing before I forgot what it looked like in my =
dream.
    I completed it but now I guess I must test it to see if it is wh=
at I 
    think it is... an EVP Box, maybe???
