<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well some files exhibit more possibilities than others and have better results for me (my opinion). The pangram file I did was probably one of the best I was getting live feedback when they were helping me with the settings for that file. I think I posted that before.

&gt; Worked ok tho I did find some languages lean more towards
&gt; the 
&gt; consonant sounds than the vowel sounds and vice versa.

&gt; &gt; How did the foreign language dialog work out? A few
&gt; weeks ago a 
&gt; friend of mine was explaining to me that some researchers
&gt; in Europe 
&gt; use foreign language radio stations for the background.
&gt; That way 
&gt; English language is relatively simple to pick out and there
&gt; is a 
&gt; lesser chance of radio fragments.

&gt; &gt; Ive tried all kinds of stuff. Musical notes, snippets
&gt; of dialogue 
&gt; in 
&gt; &gt; multiple languages, allophones, crowd noise, me saying
&gt; &quot;the quick 
&gt; brown 
&gt; &gt; fox..&quot; pangram worked very well. If you want I
&gt; can send you a few 
&gt; that 
&gt; &gt; have worked for me or upload them to my esnips.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cool Becca. Sounded like you used the
&gt; allophone file for the raw
&gt; &gt; &gt; audio. Ive had some good results using Stefans
&gt; evpmaker software. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I did. I think that sample was the allophone
&gt; slowed by 20%.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; What else other than white noise / allophone do
&gt; people use?
