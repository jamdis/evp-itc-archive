&gt; A simpler explanation is that, when listening to ambiguous audio, you tend
&gt; to interpret the noise in the context of your current state of mind. It is a
&gt; simpler explanation to explain hearing a difference in ambiguous audio from
&gt; week to week under that assumption, than to attribute the change to spirit
&gt; activity in the electronics or on the media.
&gt;
&gt; Seems to me.

&gt; &gt; how is that physically possible? i know we are only beginning to
&gt; understand spirit energy, but that had to have been purposefully tampered
