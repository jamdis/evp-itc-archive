<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I wrote him back with his original message attached and copied it to the
members of his group that claimed I was trying to steal them. I politely
told him he was falsely accusing me of illegally posting the evidence
especially since I signed nothing. He never even mentioned anything about
any evidence prior to this.  I explained that I wasn&#x27;t trying to steal his
members.
I asked them (and him) if they would like to join on an investigation, not
join the group and I told him that this 16 year old doesn&#x27;t exist.
He replied apologizing. He agreed he forgot to have me sign the forms.  He
talked to the girls mother again and found that she&#x27;s changed her story a
few times. I&#x27;m just glad it&#x27;s not going to be an ongoing drama.

&gt; I have a legal question that I cannot seem to find an answer to. I recently
&gt; went on an investigation to a public place with a  paranormal group. While
&gt; my experience is much less than theirs, I found them to be too disorganized.
&gt; Three people came from the group. One had no equipment and the second used
&gt; his cell phone. I never even saw a pencil. So, I started a small group,
&gt; specifically for amateur investigators staying in local public places so we
&gt; don&#x27;t get in over our heads. We aren&#x27;t trying to get any resident
&gt; investigations and are non competitive. On our site I put photos and evps I
&gt; had gotten while on the investigation and put at the bottom that some
&gt; evidence was obtained while on investigations with other groups. I didn&#x27;t
&gt; use any of their names. As with any of my photos, I blocked out any faces,
&gt; and it was all on my equipment. I signed nothing and agreed to nothing.
&gt; Yesterday he sent me an email saying he wants it taken down. It&#x27;s
&gt; technically and legally his ( technically and legally?). If I wanted to
&gt; start my own group all I had to do was ask. He has said that I invited a 16
&gt; year old to join the group (Definitely didn&#x27;t). And that he thought I would
&gt; join their group.
&gt; -I don&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s right on the legal issue. Ethically, I would have
&gt; accredited the group if he was more diplomatic and maybe even taken it down.
&gt;
&gt; - wouldn&#x27;t making false accusations make him guilty of liable?
&gt; - I don&#x27;t need to ask him to do ****. I&#x27;ve met him twice.
&gt;
&gt; Does anybody know of any place where I can find something written on the
&gt; law about those photos and media being mine.
