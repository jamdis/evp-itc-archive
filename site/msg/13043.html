<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Reading your post Mike reminded me of when a sheriff&#x27;s deputy on scene
at the Murrah building site gave me a small chunk of the marble
building facing and told me to get it to a psychic. At the time I
scoffed at the idea, and thought it was an interesting keepsake. This
was well before I had my awakening interest in the paranormal or
spirit communication. As a child, basically, just out of high school I
tucked the piece away until after moving countless times, I lost it. A
shame, as the majority of the rubble lies under a hundred feet of soil
at the bottom of the eastern oklahoma county landfill now and a
special opportunity was lost to youthful ignorance.

I don&#x27;t know if unfettered communication is possible anywhere at
anytime, but it would certainly make sense that an object or location
could act as a &quot;long distance calling card&quot; or similar and facilitate
communication a lot easier. Just my thoughts, not backed up with any
conclusive date for or against, but I always found session
communications seem easier (as far as results) at location of the
event. Then again the voices I received did not correlate with the
event. I am very interested in hearing what happens after your
sessions, please keep us updated.

Thanks
Andy

&gt; Greetings fellow researchers,
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ve been out-of-pocket for the last week, visiting the Washington DC
&gt; area and attending a 4 day conference where many high powered people in
&gt; that kind of business who gave some interesting briefings. Lucky for
&gt; me... I was in attendance and got to meet and listen to those who wear
&gt; lots of stars or are appointed to positions of our Nation&#x27;s power base.
&gt; Unfortunately, the conference wasn&#x27;t about EVP, ITC, or spirit
&gt; communication. But, who knows... maybe someday they (at the top) will
&gt; hold a conference like that.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway... I wanted to give an update on my latest direction for those
&gt; who e-mailed me or messaged me while I was on the east coast last week.
&gt; First... I&#x27;d like to thank that documentary production company for
&gt; contacting me, asking about the use of my prototypes, but I have to
&gt; respectfully decline your offer as I only do this for my own research,
&gt; providing the information FREE to all who desire to built there own
&gt; devices. And after having been led astray by a not-to-be-named
&gt; paranormal radio show venue about a certain Stanley Hotel conference,
&gt; I&#x27;m a bit gun-shy at getting involved with such ventures.  Also, for
&gt; those who wrote and asked about me selling products,  I don&#x27;t build and
&gt; sell anything. I just provide FREE information for my fellow
&gt; researchers.
&gt; 
&gt; Okay... on with my story.
&gt; While sitting in my hotel room last week I continued to read one of
&gt; Sarah Estep&#x27;s books. In one of the chapters she writes about the plane
&gt; crash into the Potomac River, which happened a number of years ago. Many
&gt; people died when the airplane went into that frozen river, and she
&gt; explains how she and others began receiving messages from the crash
&gt; victims at almost the exact time time crash occurred, even though she
&gt; didn&#x27;t know about the crash at the time.
&gt; 
&gt; She then writes about the crash of two jumbo jets, where hundreds lost
&gt; their lives instantly, or soon after the accident. And how the spirit
&gt; world was filled with communication because of this large disaster.
&gt; 
&gt; That got me thinking...
&gt; 
&gt; I too have always been super sensitive about deadly plane crashes,
&gt; feeling for the families of the victims, as well as, and especially for
&gt; the victims themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; One crash in particular put me into the extensive research mode about
&gt; the crash and the victims. So-much-so that I contacted the wife of the
&gt; plane&#x27;s pilot, where I was able to help put some closure into her world
&gt; after a number of contacts. (Not wanting to discuss too much, let me
&gt; just say I was able to view things she was not allowed to view. And
&gt; after doing so I was able to describe things to her that she always
&gt; wondered about.)
&gt; 
&gt; The commercial aircraft in question crashed so violently that remains of
&gt; the passengers were never all recovered. And after years of legal
&gt; battling, the settlements were made and the entire aircraft wreckage was
&gt; released to a salvage company.
&gt; I was there, at the warehouse, when the many trucks left with the many
&gt; pieces of plane, enroute to their salvage yard.  And while there I
&gt; talked with the attorney and investigative lead, who were both on-scene
&gt; to over-see the finalization of this effort.
&gt; 
&gt; To get off topic for a bit, I for one am of the opinion that in the
&gt; spirit communication world, an object is key if communication with a
&gt; specific entity is desired. I know many do not agree, and think that
&gt; open communication is possible anytime, anywhere... but I&#x27;m not one of
&gt; those people.
&gt; 
&gt; I may be wrong or I may be right, but I think an object or location are
&gt; a must when specific communication is desired. hence, the reason I stand
&gt; next to a certain grave site, or location where a death actually
&gt; happened, or have a related object in hand or near where a session is
&gt; being done.
&gt; 
&gt; Okay... having said that, while I was observing the movement of the
&gt; plane crash debris, I was offered a small piece or two by those who now
&gt; owned the salvage material. (No longer in litigation and no longer owned
&gt; by the airline company).  I refused acceptance of anything at the time,
&gt; but asked if the salvage company had, by chance, forgotten something in
&gt; the warehouse or on the grounds, was it okay for a person to possess it.
&gt; They told me, yes.
&gt; 
&gt; Later that evening, when all the material had been moved out of the
&gt; warehouse, I once again visited the scene. Looking around I found they
&gt; had done a very good job at clean-up, only leaving a few pieces of small
&gt; metal, wire, paper, and fabric near the large doors.
&gt; 
&gt; I picked up the few items that were still there and headed toward the
&gt; large trash container that was on the property, my intensions to drop
&gt; those items into the trash. But, while holding them I received a very
&gt; strong feeling, a very emotional sensation that would not allow me to
&gt; put them in the trash. It was so strong in-fact, that I began crying. 
&gt; It just flowed through me, consuming me as it went.
&gt; 
&gt; My emotional feeling was just like it had been earlier in the day when I
&gt; placed one hand on one of the engines that were mangled and filled with
&gt; impacted dirt that was once the ground in the place that became the
&gt; final resting place.
&gt; 
&gt; Once I arrived home, I carefully placed the small amount of debris
&gt; material (metal, wire, carpet fabric, paper, etc.) into a sealed glass
&gt; canister, where it remains to this day.
&gt; 
&gt; Where am I going with this story...???
&gt; 
&gt; Two weeks from now, I have a two week vacation coming... which will be
&gt; spent at home.
&gt; 
&gt; After reading Sarah Estep&#x27;s book, especially the chapter about the plane
&gt; crash victims, I&#x27;ve decided to use those objects I acquired from the
&gt; warehouse grounds, as the objects that may help me make some specific
&gt; spirit contacts.
&gt; I have already researched that crash, and I have all the victims names,
&gt; along with some information of there life&#x27;s. Maybe I will be able to
&gt; gain information and answer some questions... so I can contact others,
&gt; besides the original contact with the pilot&#x27;s wife, as I told you about
&gt; earlier in my writing.
&gt; 
&gt; All I can do is try... and see what happens.
