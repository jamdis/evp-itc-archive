Rhonda,
 
I have explained why, and have even posted a comparison file to =
bolster my explanation.
Sceptics are closed minded individuals that will ne=
ver concede to any kind of paranormal proof
no matter how it is presented, =
in my original post I stated that I was beyond considering proving this com=
munication.
One would only have to turn on a box in someones presence to do=
 that. The important thing to me now
Is the messages that are being receive=
d and understanding their meaning. If that takes me cutting out a few blips=
 and blahs
from a file in order to hear the message without interruption, s=
o be it. Hard line sceptics in my book are the bottom feeders of 
the paran=
ormal world, because they are incompetenet when it comes to gathering valid=
 data or they are frightened by the 
chance of proving something that they =
are afraid really does exist or for whatever reason. in my ten years of exp=
erience in dealing with them
I have never run into one that's mind could be=
 changed, even if it was a manifested spirit themselves trying to change it=
.
 
So to me Sceptics and debunkers be damned!
 
I clip the garbage from my=
 files and so do some of the other more experienced 
researchers here. By y=
our statement in this post you are saying that I am a dishonest researcher =
and the files I present are doctored or fraudulent.
 
"did it occur to me t=
hat others on here would either....
but ur right there are people out there=
 who are dishonest 
and would do that without blinkin an eye...."
 
 
 
Jul=
i was very hasty in writing that post and It was actually directed at a sin=
gle individual, it should never have been written without forethought of th=
e ramifications it would insinuate.
She has attempted to amend her position=
 in a short post following the one she wrote mentioning my name and Steve's=
 name, omitting us from her comments. But I guess that did not work evident=
ly, Like I told her most readers of the post would take the wrong meaning.
=
 
At this point in my research I do not feel the need to prove anything to =
anyone, and like I said all raw versions of my files will be made available=
 upon request by respected critics in this field.

I under=
