With TV going HD, I \nhaven&#39;t spent much time onthe video systems though. \n\n I did make a printed circuit board for linear sweep with the audio \namplifiers, and another board for Ranom sweep. The only problem, the \nstuff remains so time consumming to put together.

I was wondering if anyone had created an all \nin\n&gt; one ITC EVP device. I know that researchers such as Seidle had \ncreated\n&gt; the psychophone that seemed to cover many aspects of ITC but I have\n&gt; yet to see all ways of communication in one device.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have created an all in one design that covers most of the devices\n&gt; used. If you wish I will share the design.\n&gt;"}
