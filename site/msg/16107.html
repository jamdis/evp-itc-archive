It doesn't really matter if it's a "point event" (by which I assume you mea=
n a short burst).=A0=A0 It
        depends on a lot of things: the type and=
 sensitivity of the equipment; 
        its environment; the types of radia=
tion to which it is exposed; and its 
        intensity and duration.=A0

As regards chenobyl, there was a lot of radioactice material released into =
the environment, and which still causes problems, especially as the materia=
l blown into surrounding soils is released, even to enter the=A0 foodchain.=
=A0 While the restricted areas there may be the worst (and the easiest to c=
ontain), they are by no means the end of the problem, nor the extent of the=
 continuing radiation issues.

      If we're talking about radiation=
 as the transference

equipment.=A0 The 
        biggest example often cited is the electromagnet=

        nuclear blast, that can disable electronic e=
quipment.=A0 But even 
        smaller events can do it: satellites have to=
 be protected against 
        certain radiation so their memory isn't zapp=
ed, etc.

So it 
        depends on a lot of things: the type and sensitivi=
ty of the equipment; 
        its environment; the types of radiation to wh=

As a side =
note, remember something 
        as benign as a magnet can royally screw u=
p some electronic components as 
        well.
