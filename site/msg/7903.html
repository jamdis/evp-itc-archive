<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>To me that just seems unbelievable, unless the only techs attracted 
to the paranormal are piss poor. The whole thing is based on Op Amps, 
simple to use electronic building blocks.

box.  Except for Frank

his boxes but there are plenty of alternatives out there. You can use 
manual sweep (free to try) or pick up one of the radio shack radios 
to modify so that it does a linear scan emulating some of Franks 
boxes. Those cost about 25 bucks and quite easy to follow the 
instructions. I just posted the links to Mikes videos on youtube 
about how to modify those. Check recent posts. For those to squeamish 
to follow the videos instructions, there is also other versions that 
have been produced that generally do same thing which are being sold 
like the minibox .
