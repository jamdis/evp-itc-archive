<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>And that is how ya fix that! I&#x27;m not taking that BS any longer. These self rightous crackheads that are going to tell me what the box really is and how the paranomal really works, while intimidating memebers not to post or discuss anything meaninful. I hit the &quot;remove member&quot; button -twice! I&#x27;ve had it with veiled skeptics and debunkers.

&gt; &quot;So if someone is saying that something you have worked on for years is all
&gt; in your head while they completely ignore all evidence and results, you just
&gt; sit quiet, don&#x27;t say a word cuz someone might get upset? &quot;
&gt; 
&gt; No, it&#x27;s that you don&#x27;t say anything argumentative. You take the high road.
&gt; If you feel you must say something, you can say &quot;we&#x27;ll have to agree to
&gt; disagree,&quot; or &quot;that is your opinion,&quot; etc, because it is just their opinion.
&gt; No need to get personal, insulting, emotional or overly defensive. If you
&gt; believe in what you are doing, what does it matter what anyone else in the
&gt; whole universe believes?
&gt; 
&gt; There is intelligent debate, and then there is petty arguments. Getting
&gt; petty does nothing for you or your cause, and only brings you down to your
&gt; opponents petty levels.
&gt; 
&gt; The old adage really holds true-if you can&#x27;t say something nice, don&#x27;t say
&gt; anything at all.

&gt; &gt; In the meantime, if some chase only the dark shadows, &quot;investigate&quot; in the
&gt; &gt; dark at night, get growling voices saying &quot;get oput&quot;--that must be the
&gt; &gt; absolute truth!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There seems to be no way to beat the negativity on this planet. All focus
&gt; &gt; on the darkside, the lies, the misinformation. All seek only fear and evil,
&gt; &gt; the drama, Hollywood fame. No place for truth of anykind or form here.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Think I&#x27;m done here.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree, If you don&#x27;t like what somebody says, just push delete.  There
&gt; &gt; are so many
&gt; &gt; &gt; other things going on in the world to get upset about.  You just attract
&gt; &gt; more negativity.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; IS THIS WHERE YOU LIVE?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;No, I live in heaven, and my affections
&gt; &gt; &gt; are there. I just borrow this shack while
&gt; &gt; &gt; waiting for my ride home.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I am. I try to stay objective and I&#x27;ve read your past e-mails and
&gt; &gt; honestly, I think a lot of people are reading things into what you post that
&gt; &gt; I do not see. I do not understand the hostility that is being flung at you.
&gt; &gt; People are misunderstanding you tremendously for some reason.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; This does not bode well ...

&gt; &gt; &gt; I can see you&#x27;re not in favor of this suggestion for a more peaceful
&gt; &gt; group, though I don&#x27;t understand why,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is anyone else with me on this?

&gt; &gt; &gt; that would be fine, if you didn&#x27;t piss Frank off....... But you do.....
&gt; &gt; &gt; AND THAT IS NOT OKAY.....
&gt; &gt; &gt; The same thing will happen when you do it again....
&gt; &gt; &gt; So what&#x27;s the point in you being here.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I expect none of us like all the recent attacks, insults, accusations,
&gt; &gt; threats, hurting of feelings, and attempts to piss people off.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Can I suggest we stick to the purpose of the group: &quot;the discussion,
&gt; &gt; promotion, and developemnt of Electronic Voice Phenomenon, and Instrumental
&gt; &gt; Transcommunication methods and technologies as used in the communication
&gt; &gt; with spirit, and other entities.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; And that we go with Frank&#x27;s philosophy &quot;just take the approach, try
&gt; &gt; different methods, see what works.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; No more threats. No name calling, insults, or accusations. Just try to
&gt; &gt; keep a positive group attitude, be open that not everyone believes what
&gt; &gt; everyone else does, and that&#x27;s ok?
