Hey Amy it's about time! What the heck happened to ya after we talked...errr uhhh never mind you can send a private email to me??
   
  Everythings finally getting back in shape. Theres alot of new members, Frank and Amy's back, (YAAAAY IM NOT ALONE LOL) and I just found a new unlimited webhost that appears to be FREE with no limitations or crappy ads for my evp's LOL
   
  Can I hear a woohoooooooo
   
  Man I am sooo rusty at building webpages this could take years. I have forgotten more than I thought so my evp database idea is going to be slow going. Well unless someone volunteers help LOL but I wont count on it. So far I have 1/4 of the main page layed out...and thats about as far as I got in 3 hours (LOL rusty just doesnt describe how disappointed I am in myself right now)
   
  I tried to email you but never got a reply back. Last time I saw you was when you were on from the hotel. You missed a few good experiments and some gallery updates and Franks debut of the new boxes but you can catch up on most just by reading the posts. If theres any files you wanted to hear that arent in your email just holler. I am not sure what all made it thru.
