<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I hope these stay up longer than a few hours.....I converted to MP3. My mistake on first time upload as they were in the longer .wav format (sounded best though...that&#x27;s why was my original) They were DELETED. I should have read sticky ;)I hope these are helpful for others to hear what is out there. Very few have been enhanced (Audacity) so headphones are a MUST. You can find the EVP&#x27;s in file name: Jim&#x27;s RR-DR6o EVP&#x27;s    ENJOY :)</pre>
