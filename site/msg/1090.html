  this guy has the right weird-stuff and doesnt seem too pressed for time.  very very sharp on 
   
  "THROUGH the noise floor" receiver/detectors
   
  if adapted to transistors-especially hig freq high gain low noise, state-of-the art ones like mrf901,966,571,   some of these outback fremodynes could squeeze quantum noise into one end of the output and precipitate it as charge.
   
  the "other" magneto-electric waves behave as if they were about twenty times the frequency of ordinary RF of the same wavelength.  phase can be 180 from normal rf,anything but perfect 90 degrees in fact, and can switch unexpectedly.
   
  critical coupling distance is about two to 3 times that of ordinary RF which is easiest way to "split the positive"; separate ordinary from extraordinary.
   
  all capacitors appear much larger than nominal value except when used in LC circuit
   
  many diodes and transformer core materials appear as short circuit.
   
  ordinary components can be hacked to work with "other" RF
   
  all the above applies to lower frequencies, motors, batteries as well
