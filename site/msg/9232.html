I know I have offered before but you haven't responded. Your wife can't 
complain if people donate to your research could she? You have done so much for 
this field that some people should be allowed to donate to you without 
expecting anything in return. What do you think?

 I hate to ask for anything. I can afford what I need for myself. What I want to do is make some printed circuit boards that have the sweep, and amplifiers, then I would only have to add whatever tuner I want to use to form a system, and I could make the boards available. I wouldn't mind putting this stuff together for others, but the requests/demands are so overwhelming, there just isn't enough time.
