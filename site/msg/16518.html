Perhaps I am not being clear.=C2=A0 I am not asking how it works.=C2=A0 I a=
m asking what you claim it does.

For example, from your statements below, =
I get:

"The Frank's box allows entities to use FM and AM radio broadcast a=
s raw material, which these enties select and shape to communicate with the=
 user.=C2=A0 The messages received are for the user, and rarely does anyone=
 hear the same thing as the original listener."

Can you be any more specif=
ic as to what you mean by 'entities'?
Also, can the user be defined as the =
person asking the box questions?

Frank - or anyone - what is a good official statement on what the Fran=
