<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Guy,
 If you have contact with Alec you may wish to forward the attached capture I got yesterday. The first part of the message was a salutation from Canada. I clipped that part off and here is the main message.

&quot;Alpha may be best system&quot; 

Thanks,
Dave

Hello, Suzette!

The description was for a project that Scottish researcher Alexander 
MacRae was funded for (by Bial - a pharmaceutical company in 
Portugal). The questions given below were just an example of the 
questions given on the charts attached to sound samples sent to 
those of us on the international listening panel over these last 2 
years. The project was just completed in December so you&#x27;re no 
longer able to be a part of it (sorry).

As soon as I get permission from Alec - I&#x27;ll post the final report 
along with a chart and the samples for that particular chart (and a 
few others I found interesting).

Good luck in your own experiments!

Guy

&gt; I would like to do the EVP experiment:
&gt;   I would like to start today....I will try at 
&gt;   least 3 times to ask the following 
&gt;   questions below. I will go into 3 different 
&gt;   rooms of my house to record in each. 
&gt;   When will we hear the results of the test? 
&gt;   Will we be witten each personally on the results?
&gt;   Or how will we know how the spirits did. 
&gt;   In the opinion of science that is!

&gt; 
&gt; The Intelligence Project 
&gt; 
&gt; A Project involving EVP and Listening
&gt; 
&gt; If you have done EVP for a while you will already know whether or 
&gt; not what you say is responded to sometimes - you will already know 
&gt; if there seems to be some sort of awareness there.
&gt; 
&gt; You may believe this to be so, and so may I, but the world in 
&gt; general will just take this as further evidence of 
&gt; our &quot;deteriorating mental ability&quot;!
&gt; 
&gt; You can&#x27;t prove anything - all you can do is state your firm 
belief 
&gt; and perhaps back that up with some examples which you hope don&#x27;t 
&gt; sound too &quot;made-up&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; This project aims to deal with that situation once and for all. We 
&gt; believe in working with science rather than against it. Science is 
&gt; not our enemy, nor indeed is scepticism.
&gt; 
&gt; Method
&gt; What we want to find out is if there is any relationship between 
&gt; what the experimenter says and the type of EVP responses that we 
get.
&gt; 
&gt; We are looking for signs of intelligence.
&gt; 
&gt; We want to do that in a measurable way - for that is the way of 
&gt; science. And this is the way that has been approved by a major 
&gt; European pharmaceutical company for funding.
&gt; 
&gt; We have six questions. These questions are decided on in advance. 
&gt; 
&gt; During the experiment the experimenter asks each of the questions, 
&gt; in turn, with a 30-second gap after each question to allow any 
&gt; responses to be recorded. 
&gt; 
&gt; So (for example) what you would get is,
&gt; 
&gt; Question &#x27;What is the time?&#x27; 
&gt; [30 seconds delay]; 
&gt; Question &#x27;What is your name?&#x27; 
&gt; [30 seconds delay], 
&gt; Question &#x27;What do you like best?&#x27;
&gt; [30 second delay]
&gt; and so on.
&gt; 
&gt; Now if an utterance is heard within the 30-second period and if 
the 
&gt; utterance sounds as though it could be a response to the question, 
&gt; then it is treated as an actual response. For example if we hear 
&gt; the utterance &#x27;John Smith&#x27; seven seconds after the question &#x27;What 
is 
&gt; your name?&#x27; is asked, then that looks like a response to that 
&gt; question.
&gt; 
&gt; The experimenter carries out the session, asking each of the 
&gt; questions in turn; and then the recording of the session is turned 
&gt; over to a speech analyst.
&gt; 
&gt; The analyst picks out from the general background noise all the 
&gt; utterances he can find in the recording. He refines his search 
&gt; still further by selecting out the 16 utterances of the best 
&gt; quality. (sometimes it will be less than 16), and &quot;shuffles&quot; these 
&gt; so that you will not know which came first, which came second and 
so 
&gt; on.
&gt; 
&gt; The final 16 utterances, their order shuffled, are sent out to you.
&gt; 
&gt; What you are asked to do is decide if any of the utterances could 
be 
&gt; a response to any of the questions, and to fill in a table like 
that 
&gt; shown in the example below.
&gt; 
&gt; Track No. Could be a response to Question Number..
&gt; BR01 4
&gt; BR02 0
&gt; BR03 0
&gt; BRO4 3
&gt; BR05 1
&gt; BR06 2
&gt; BR07 3
&gt; BRO8 3
&gt; BR09 6
&gt; BR10 0
&gt; BR11 0
&gt; BR12 0
&gt; BR13 6
&gt; BR14 5
&gt; BR15 0
&gt; BR16 0
&gt; 
&gt; As you can see some utterances are not considered to be a response 
&gt; to any of the questions, and so a &#x27;0&#x27; is inserted at that point. 
&gt; This is not an easy test, that is why you are being asked to help.
&gt; 
&gt; Please send your results to XXX@... and then they will get put 
&gt; into our database - and in time we will be told the results.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, however, preliminary results look quite promising and 
&gt; your assistance on this vital project is very much appreciated!
