After I had many \nmessages relayed from spirits that couldn&#39;t use the computer, I was \nthinking about what else I could use and came up with the ghost box. \n\n Frank-S \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Saqqara&quot; &lt;goddess_saqqara@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok, blonde question.\n&gt; \n&gt; What is a Ghost Box?\n&gt; and What does it do or what is it for?\n&gt; \n&gt; Saqqara\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday \n&gt; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hey Gabreael,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The file you posted and randy cleaned up for you has been way way \n&gt; over processed with the audio editer.\n&gt; &gt; send me the file and I&#39;ll go over it for you.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Randy no disrespect intended.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; bruce\n&gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@: phaser2000@: Tue, 15 Jan 2008 21:28:38 -\n&gt; 0700Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] My first Ghost Box Reply Recorded & \nNeeded \n&gt; Audobe Audition Help\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Gab,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;   I cleaned up you file a little bit more. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; -Randy\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: eastern_paranormal \n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, January 15, 2008 6:06 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] My first Ghost Box Reply Recorded & Needed \n&gt; Audobe Audition Help\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I uploaded my first Ghost Box recording to my EVP file today.
