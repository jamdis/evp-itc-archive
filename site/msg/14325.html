&gt;    No need to apologize, I wasn&#x27;t picking a fight just trying to head off
&gt; a rumor mill before it started. Not necassarily from your response Rick, but
&gt; you know how these posts feed off one another and build. No worries! ;)

&gt; I&#x27;m sorry if I hit some kind of nerve, but it was really just a simple
&gt; question, and I&#x27;m sure you can understand why the rumor would arouse
&gt; curiosity. There&#x27;s no need to head anything off on my account, and as you
&gt; said, he can speak for himself if he likes. Though, because of the tone of
&gt; your response, I hope he does address it now, to clear up any ideas which
&gt; your reaction might have engendered.

&gt; &gt; Look guys don&#x27;t read anything into it. Frank and Chris have had a &quot;on
&gt; again, off again&quot; relationship as long as they have known each other. I
&gt; normally don&#x27;t speak up for Sumption, he is quite capable of speaking for
&gt; himself but I thought I would head this off before imaginations got away
&gt; from you all.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If he wants you to know his business he will let you know. I feel you
&gt; overstep your bounds to expect an explanation.

&gt; &gt; I noticed on Chris Moon&#x27;s Myspace blog he posted:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &quot;People also have a misconception that Mr. Sumption and I are at war
&gt; which is not true. As a matter of fact we have tentative plans for a joint
&gt; research project this fall.&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe Frank could shed some more light on this partnership?
