A not-so active place gleaned only 4-6 messages \n(I don&#39;t really keep the &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; &quot;hi,&quot; etc short, one-word \nmessages too often as evidence).  \n\nI am pretty pleased with the results of the prototype, though I was \ntold by some it wouldn&#39;t work the way we had built it and almost \nscrapped it (I formerly hated the FM band as well).    \n\nLC \n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; \n&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thanks! Well, that&#39;s the main thing, I don&#39;t do investigations, I \ndo \n&gt; all my recordings from the basement, at home. Even at Stanely, I \nwas \n&gt; present at &quot;investigations&quot; but everyone else asked thew questions, \n&gt; iI just kinda stood by. \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt;  --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank, I understand where you are coming from, as I often get \n&gt; &gt; frustrated when I hear myself or another asking a question and \n&gt; there \n&gt; &gt; is an answer within the same audio from the spirits.  So I agree \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; this.  I only hear about 10% of the answers live, and find re-\n&gt; &gt; listening to the recording at least two times is beneficial to \n&gt; catch \n&gt; &gt; everything.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, we were at a lighthouse that was supposed to be haunted, \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; a lady asked if there was a &quot;Captain Babcock&quot; with us.  About 8 \n&gt; &gt; seconds later, the reply, &quot;Spirit of Babcock&quot; came through \n&gt; clearly.  \n&gt; &gt; The file is in my folder here.  So I do see value as well in \nasking \n&gt; &gt; questions.  The downside is we have a tendency to talk over them \n&gt; &gt; sometimes, yet, it is nice to provide the earthbounds direction \nto \n&gt; &gt; help them speak what we need to hear (to help them).  If people \n&gt; think \n&gt; &gt; they do not need help, then they haven&#39;t been doing this enough \nin \n&gt; &gt; places where people in spirit are in trauma.  Believe me, some of \n&gt; &gt; them truly are and are in need of help - period.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Perhaps there are two ways to do this, depending on what one is \n&gt; &gt; trying to accomplish.  At a haunted location, I seem to hear \n&gt; &gt; enlightened spirits, as well as earthbounds coming through.  This \n&gt; &gt; type of situation can be especially helpful to ask questions in \nmy \n&gt; &gt; experience, as it helps to ferret out what&#39;s going on there and \n&gt; &gt; provide &quot;evidence&quot; of intelligent responses to the questions.  \nThis \n&gt; &gt; worked well to prove the spirit box as legit to the group who \n&gt; &gt; accompanied me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When just trying to get &quot;higher&quot; messages from spirits, etc at \nhome \n&gt; &gt; or elsewhere, I do think just letting it run and record is a \ngreat \n&gt; &gt; way to work with it, too.  This way, there are no expectations, \n&gt; just \n&gt; &gt; taking the time to listen for direction, messages of truth, \nhellos, \n&gt; &gt; etc.  Sometimes this way will really surprise you, especially \nwhen \n&gt; &gt; something comes through &quot;off the cuff&quot; and you are not expecting \n&gt; it.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Frank, I hear your advice captain, but also want to throw in some \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; my personal experiences into the discussion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi All;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  This is why I say don&#39;t get so tied up asking questions and \n&gt; trying \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; get that one profound answer while missing all the real stuff. \nIn \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; file I have in my folder of the 30 second test of #36, the very \n&gt; &gt; first \n&gt; &gt; &gt; voice is &quot;Thomas Edison(sung)--I Never Visited Frank&quot;, I did \nnot \n&gt; &gt; hear \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this until the third time I listened to the entire session. I&#39;m \n&gt; not \n&gt; &gt; so \n&gt; &gt; &gt; intent on runing session after session all friggin&#39; day that I \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have/take time to listen. If I was trying to hear this stuff \n&gt; &gt; direct, I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; would miss it, and simialr voices about 99% of the time. That&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; why, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; forget the damn questions, and just listen--over and over till \n&gt; you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; think you&#39;ve gotten it all. Even my dad, and son come through \nin \n&gt; &gt; their \n&gt; &gt; &gt; own time, I don&#39;t costantly ask for them. I swear to God, they \n&gt; know \n&gt; &gt; who \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is listening, when you are listening/recording, and what you \nneed \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; know! Trust it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  I know, the idiot scientist type will insist you have to ask \n&gt; &gt; &gt; questions, and confirm the answers, but that is BS, and results \n&gt; &gt; little \n&gt; &gt; &gt; useful information. Useful, as in has personal signifgance. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
