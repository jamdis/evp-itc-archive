I had them \nstretched out about 100feet, I went back to pull a little more , and here&#39;s \nthis strip if plastic tied around each of the cables, not just tangled, \nneatly tied, and I know for fact that I was the only one down there. Both \nsides were tied in two half hitches, I would think that would be impossible \nto happen by chance. I told &quot;them&quot; that was a good joke!\n\n\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDon���t miss your chance to WIN $10,000 and other great prizes from Microsoft \nOffice Live http://clk.atdmt.com/MRT/go/aub0540003042mrt/direct/01/"}
