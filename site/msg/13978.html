Healthy debate is one thing. Yes, it can be a good thing. I am not saying don&#x27;t exchange viewpoints with people.  But it is only healthy debate if both parties are willing to consider the other&#x27;s opinion. I bet you no matter what Frank were to say, these people would never consider a word he says.

Just as you say, there has to be a mutual respect between parties in order to carry on and intelligent debate, like we are doing with this discussion.

Frank can stand up all he wants if that is want he wants to do, but for all that, he won&#x27;t change these people&#x27;s opinions, and in the end he will only invite more hassle from them.

He should see that these people and their opinions don&#x27;t mean anything to his own personal growth, research and knowledge.

Engaging these types in petty argument just drains you of your energy. There is no winner. It is a waste of time and energy. Energy that could have been put to a much worthier task. It is much better to take the high road and leave the haters to themselves.
