Yeah unfortunately the term skeptic has gained alot of negative baggage bec=
ause of all the disbelievers using it. By disbeliever, I mean someone who w=
ouldn't believe in a ghost if it walked right up to them.

    I tend to agree regarding the definitions of bel=
iefs. There seems to be a continuum: at each end are people with closed min=
ds who operate from a dogma of philosophy and beliefs. In each case their p=
ositions are relatively unshakable. One end is the staunch believer and the=
 other end is what I and others have come to call the 'pseudoskeptic'. It i=
s this latter type of person who often labels themselves a 'skeptic' and wh=
o tries to argue from what they term positions of 'logic', say they are 'cr=
itical thinkers' and demand 'evidence' placing their faith in their version=
 of 'science'. All of these terms are of their own definition and are malea=
ble depending on the situation. In the center of this spectrum are what I t=
hink of as the true and only 'open-minded critical thinkers'. I suppose one=
 could label these individuals as 'skeptics' but this kind of clouds the is=
sue. I am sad to say that I really believe the size of this third group is =
well under 1/3 of everyone. Just my opinion of course.
