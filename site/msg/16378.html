<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi magnolia.massage,

I started more than a year ago with a radio shack &quot;hacked&quot; box that
another member hacked for me so that it continuously scanned stations.
Here&#x27;s what I did: despite feeling a little silly, I turned on the
radio and my Olympus digital recorder, and I asked my questions in the
direction of the radio (it felt like I was talking to myself, and I
expected nothing to happen). After 5 minutes or so, I quit recording
then uploaded the .wav file to Sound Forge on my computer. It sounded
pretty much like hearing myself talk to a scanning radio -- nothing
intelligible there. Then I used Sound Forge to slow down the gibberish
I heard in the scanning portions, and as I experimented with slower
playback speeds I began hearing &quot;Hi Al&quot; and all sorts of other
comments that could not possibly have been a part of radio programming
fragments. As I mentioned in my first post the other day, this
eventually turned into a distressing situation for me in which the
radio shack radio began turning itself on, literally, each morning and
I later began hearing the voices without aid of a radio. I assure you
I am telling you the 100 percent truth.  Apparently, something
&quot;negative&quot; attached itself here and it took much effort and help from
a Catholic priest to get rid of it. I don&#x27;t exactly know what we did
that was THE solution to get rid of it, but it finally left.  I knew
nothing about how to protect myself at that time. Although the
negative energies may not be able to physically harm us (I still
wonder about that), the emotional/mental distress can be every bit as
bad or dangerous as physical harm. I&#x27;ve begun slowly experimenting
again but this time I am trying some new techniques to protect myself.
I&#x27;ve been told by experienced ghost-box users that if your intent is
positive, you will attract positive voices, and that is the theory I&#x27;m
using now as I cautiously pursue the hobby again.

My only advice would be that, if you do proceed, to use caution and to
remember that the voices lie. If I were you, I would not take any
action based on what a voice says without checking it out in the usual
human ways first.

If you&#x27;re interested in hearing more about my previous experience,
just drop me a private note off list.

Regards,
Al

&gt; Hello, Al. Like you I have many questions about the paranormal. Also like
&gt; you, I&#x27;m interested in communicating with these astral beings. Im a
&gt; beginner, and I have no clue where to start or what to start with. Any
&gt; advice you could give me would be most appreciated. What devices do you
&gt; currently use? I would like to try ITC but I have no idea how to set it up.
&gt; I would like to go beyond EVP trials with a recorder...any suggestions?
&gt; Thanks, P

&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Al, and I&#x27;m new to this list. I&#x27;m 57, early-retired due to
&gt;&gt; a disability, and have far more free time than I want or know what to do
&gt;&gt; with. Which is what got me in trouble recently. After watching &quot;White
&gt;&gt; Noise&quot; awhile back, one day I turned on a recorder and turned a radio
&gt;&gt; tuner while asking if &quot;anyone&quot; would like to talk. To my great surprise, I
&gt;&gt; found voices immediately after uploading and playing the file. I know
&gt;&gt; about evps from watching the Ghost Hunters, but these voices were talking
&gt;&gt; to me in a conversational tone and about stuff relational to questions I
&gt;&gt; asked and to stuff I was doing at the time! This progressed over time into
&gt;&gt; a running &quot;conversation&quot; with apparently living beings who are invisible
&gt;&gt; but somehow sharing this house! Can someone here please relieve my anxiety
&gt;&gt; a bit? I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m messing with something that I shouldn&#x27;t be
&gt;&gt; messing with. What are the consequences of this -- and can anyone
&gt;&gt; enlighten me about the rules or protocol for dealing with these invisible
&gt;&gt; people? And, has anyone found there is NO WAY to talk about this without
&gt;&gt; sounding crazy??
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Al
&gt;&gt;
