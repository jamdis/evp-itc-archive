Or did you seriously talk to Copernicus? (Probably the former?) \n\nAnd thanks, Wyatt, for your reply.  I&#39;m wondering if a haunting-type situation such as yours would be different from talking to your ancestors four or five generations back?  I guess I&#39;m just wondering out loud what makes us connect with some entities, no matter how obscure or nonexistent the connection, and not others?  What makes some &quot;tune in&quot; to talk to us, or hang around on a plane closest to us...or what?  At least in a haunting, you&#39;d be getting the entity that happened to reside at that location.\n\nNever mind me, guys.  I just have this driving need to understand how all this works, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible.\n\nJill\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Capericus.

Since I wasn&#39;t born until decades later, I never knew him, but I do understand that people come through we did not know in life.  Has anyone else contacted someone claiming to have lived that far back?  Or in another lifetime entirely?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
