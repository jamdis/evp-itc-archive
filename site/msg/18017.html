<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Wow, this is a pretty good experiment.  I hope we get some concrete evidence with this.  Hopefully something good will come out of this long discourse between RJ and Snowfire.  

I think this kind of stuff should have been going on before.  It really is a good idea.

&gt; Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, it is currently set to only be  viewable after the test is over, and 
&gt; on Windows.
&gt; If anyone needs a  Mac version, I could arrange that too.

&gt; Can you go to the home page of this EVP-ITC  group? 
&gt; Select on the Files folder?
&gt; Then select on the  RJ folder?
&gt; 
&gt; If you can&#x27;t, I will email you the file  directly.

&gt; Considering the attacks people  continue to make against me on here just 
&gt; for  having a different opinion of people&#x27;s results,  I think you will 
&gt; understand why I will not post  my name and address here.
&gt; 
&gt; Try anyway  though.  I don&#x27;t know how your personal  beliefs here work, but 
&gt; others seem to get  messages about people they&#x27;ve never heard of, or  
&gt; places they&#x27;ve never seen.
&gt; 
&gt; I would also  suggest anyone who tries this experiment, to  post your 
&gt; results on the list here rather than  sending them personally to me - so I won&#x27;t 
&gt; be  accused of losing any.

&gt; What is your name RJ? and where do you  live?  There are probably tons of 
&gt; RJ&#x27;s in  this world, and if i am going to ask any of my  guides if they want 
&gt; to play this game with you,  I will not ask them to run around the world a  
&gt; lookin for you. sf

&gt; I have placed a little something on top  of my computer monitor, right in 
&gt; front of me. It  is now 7/10/2010. I will leave it there 4 days,  and remove 
&gt; it Noon Denver time, on Wednesday,  7/14/2010.
&gt; 
&gt; All you have to do is ask your  boxes/spirits/ aliens/etc, what it is.
&gt; 
&gt; I  have taken a picture of it, and posted it to the  files section here, so 
&gt; there is no way I can  squirm out of the results:
&gt; 
&gt; _http://tech.  groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/  RJ/RJ.20100710. 
&gt; 1.zip_ (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip) 
&gt; 
&gt; Please do not  try to open the file before noon Wednesday. But  feel free 
&gt; to download it to your computer  beforehand, so you can be sure I won&#x27;t 
&gt; change it  during, or after, the test.
&gt; 
&gt; Answers  anyone reveals after noon Wednesday don&#x27;t count.  Partial answers 
&gt; (like just the color, or shape,  or some emotion vibe) don&#x27;t count. Just 
&gt; tell me  what it is.
&gt; 
&gt; Best of Luck. I hope for this  to be a regularly occurring experiment, and 
&gt; I  hope we all can learn from the results.
