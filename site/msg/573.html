<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Misty,

Thank you for the reply and the advices! I&#x27;ll keep experimenting with 
several setups. I think i&#x27;ll try to play the white noise through a 
speaker and record via microphone.

What about EVPMaker, do you get good results with it? I haven&#x27;t 
studied it but i have some doubts regarding how exactly the spirits 
manage to imprint the voices, since it&#x27;s a digital process?!

Regards,
Jaime.

&gt;Hi Jaime
&gt;
&gt;   I&#x27;ve never used the generators but I have heard alot of success 
&gt; stories involving them. I use a natural white noise when I record 
&gt; and get good results. The water from the fishtank is pumped thru a 
&gt; charcoal filter creating a waterfall effect and the running water 
&gt; has always been a benefit to my sessions.
&gt;
&gt;   However when using background sounds like water or music I 
&gt; usually find its best to not blast the sound and to turn the 
&gt; recording mic down halfway 50% loudness so it doesnt drown out the 
&gt; voices. I also find that most of the material is located within the 
&gt; recording at a much slower speed. For mine the more audible voices 
&gt; are usually located at -74 percent slowed (if using audacity to 
&gt; slow it) and sometimes at -30 when they have alot to get across.
&gt;
&gt;   So try adjusting the sound volume and the recording mic volume 
&gt; and see if that helps. And dont forget to try slowing it down and 
&gt; listening to it in forward and reverse.
&gt;
&gt;   Good luck!
&gt;   Misty
