ok, never mind, I see where an email comes and says it is in the files and just click to go directly to the files and it will play directly, just ignore my previous post

Why do franks files usually come as an attachment easily accessed in the emails but others do not?  Just my 2 here.

It's supposed to be about a free exchange of idea's concerning evp-itc
not a mud slinging forum or a research bashing arena.

Frank, myself and Steve are continuously posting files and asking for 
feedback and for the last three months I have gotten maybe one or two 
responses to my posts and files and I don't think Steve has gotten any.
also it seems like the only reason everyone jumps to reply to a post 
that frank makes is because he is the man with the boxes, I know there 
will be a 100 posts now saying "OH THATS NOT TRUE AT ALL" but be truth 
full with yourselves and you will find that it is.

I myself are guilty of that to a certain extent and I have a Frank's 
box already. lets all stop the bull and play nice. Let's try to further 
the research and work together with positive feedback or CONSTRUCTIVE 
criticism, CONSTRUCTIVE being the key word.
