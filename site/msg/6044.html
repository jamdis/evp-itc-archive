Welcome back Ursula. Sorry to hear about you mothers health. 
   
  When your mind is fresh and clear and you refuse to let anything negative that is said hinder your approach, your recordings will improve. One of my earliest recordings was "she has no fear" and they were right. I dont.
   
  You should pick a friend to record with, someone who has gotten beyond the negative influences. I also suggest you do short recording sessions 30 secs to 3 minutes...no more. When you limit the amount of "mic" time your focus is more maintained and so is thiers. I once had over 70 files from just a few minutes recording time. Including real time responses as well as messages on the rev side. Names given, messages given and most were pretty clear. 
   
  If you get wrapped up in the negative....it gets wrapped up into you. So just look at it as sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me. Worked for us as a kid hehehe

          Hi, guys--
I've so missed you all and have missed recording more than I can say. 
After the holiday stress and stopping to avoid bad voices, my mom went 
into the hospital two weeks ago, and I've been there since, doing 
little else but thinking of ITC constantly. I'm going to start 
recording again tonight (I've never recorded at night before), and I 
ask you guys for the ITC equivalent of prayers as I try to jump back in.
Lots of love to you all,
Ursula
