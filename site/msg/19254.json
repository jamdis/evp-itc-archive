These debunkers ignore the fact the many cultures,\npresumably not in contact with each other thousands of years ago have the\nsame 2012 date. It would seem very unlikely for this to be the case for a\nnon-event. Curious how people quote science when it backs up their beliefs,\nand disavow science if it does not. &quot;Science&quot; claims the boxes don&#39;t work.,\nit&#39;s been tested by &quot;qualified listeners&quot;.\n\nF-S\n\nBecause his one e en happens once e e y 26K yea s, and ha 's 2012, no 2112.
