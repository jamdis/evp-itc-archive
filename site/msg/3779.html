Let&#x27;s not twist words here. Show me where Chris has said you &quot;only&quot;&gt; 
get false communication or bad guys. &gt; BTW I thought we were trying 
to get the negativity behind us and move&gt; on to constructive 
discussion. Guess that&#x27;s more of the wishy-washy&gt; depends on what my 
hair feels like doing ways here. from his own blog (clipped, but not 
otherwise altered):&quot;Wednesday, November 28, 2007The Box has hit the 
fan!Current mood: distressed&quot;I have recentlybeen made aware that 
there are several replica versions of thisdevice being sold. I have 
also been told of another device that canbe purchased for very little 
from any electronics merchant andaltered by hand, producing what some 
consider to be results. As Iexpected, the samples that people have 
sent me are *nothing morethan timed radio scans that have no 
validity.* [emphasis mine]&quot;These new &quot;radio scanners&quot; are not only *a 
waste of money* forpeople looking to do research with them in hopes 
of havingeffective communication with the other side, but may in fact 
be *verydangerous*. Should demonic and other negative entities learn 
to usethese falsedevices, *the results could be devastating.*&quot;...The 
Catholic Church ... predicted the widespread sale of*false 
communication devices* as far back as last year. *I have 
recentlybegun to receive requests from individuals asking for help to 
closenegative doorways and portals that they believe they opened 
usingtheir purchased Telephone to the Dead replica*. Others are 
claiming&gt; that I am a fraud because their purchased device doesn&#x27;t 
producethe positive results I have been fortunate enough to have.&quot;So 
let&#x27;s go throug this again:*nothing more than timed radio scans that 
have no validity.**a waste of money**very dangerous**the results 
could be devastating.**false communication devices**I have recently 
begun to receive requests from individuals asking forhelp to close 
negative doorways and portals that they believe theyopened using 
their purchased Telephone to the Dead replica.*As you see, there are 
two statements that Chris is making--so much forhe&#x27;s always 
consistant, which I believe was an earlier statement thatyou made.1. 
The new boxes create accidental timed radio scans only.2. The new 
boxes are very dangerous because they draw negative results.I&#x27;m not 
sure how the two statements can stand together, but in eithercase, 
his opinion is clearly not complimentary toward the rest of thebox 
users besides the four of the 30 he says, in the same post, &quot;havebeen 
identified.&quot;Rather cheeky and insulting and wrong, HMO. But if he 
just goes ondoing sessions like the one APSR recorded, I will 
continue to laud them.Ann
