"If one person is not meant to hear it they won't hear it (I guess I am not=

I don't know for sure about=
 that one either, but I am not ready to discount it either, especially sinc=
e I stumbled across the possibility of audible scrying. But I am sure alot =
of people don't believe in scrying at all either.

What makes it a possibil=
