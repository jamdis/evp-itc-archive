<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Misty...I know the whole James Randi thing is ridiculous. I 
would just LOVE to see him knocked off his high horse. I am a natural 
skeptic yet I &quot;know&quot; something is out there and can&#x27;t wait to find it 
for myself. Thanks for the tips, I&#x27;m still confused but I&#x27;ll read up 
on that link and check out the You Tube tutorials, I appreciate your 
guidance and look forward to learning and making progress in this 
fascinating field. Have a great day :)

&gt; Hi Angela
&gt; 
&gt; LOL! Why dont they just give the winning lotto numbers that would 
be 
&gt; easier to aquire =)
&gt; 
&gt; Personally I never seek to prove this to anyone, they should 
&gt; prove/disprove it themselves. Even amongst those who arent 
skeptics, 
&gt; hearing varies. Sometimes everyones hears the same sometimes they 
&gt; dont. 
&gt; 
&gt; I also dont ask about lotto numbers LOL I dont play it.
&gt; 
&gt; As for building one yourself, most are trying out the radio 
&gt; modifications like the 12-470 or the 12-469 (horrible clicking on 
the 
&gt; 469 model but a few have gotten around it. Theres a few others 
Frank 
&gt; and Steve have messed with. I think ones the 12-125 but I am a bit 
&gt; tired so all the model numbers arent popping in my head at the 
moment.
&gt; 
&gt; A few &quot;how to&quot; videos have been posted on youtube. You can type in 
&gt; the model numbers to access a few of Mike Colletta&#x27;s (ufogeek)
&gt; available posts as well as several others who have made thier video 
&gt; instructions available online. 
&gt; 
&gt; I did try out a fan test session the other day. Tho they werent as 
&gt; loud as with water, I could still discern a few statements. They 
were 
&gt; so &quot;bass&quot; in tone that its almost out of my hearing range on a few 
so 
&gt; I didnt post them all. As for the ones I did they can be found on 
my 
&gt; esnips 
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; That should take ya to the right folder
