These people have no clue about spirit, and about  \n&gt; real spirit communcation, they have a paradigm they live by, and  \n&gt; that&#39;s that all ghosts are like the Hollywood version, and nothing  \n&gt; else exists. They ignore all contrary evidence, yet make enough  \n&gt; noise that the lay public believes them to be the true experts.  \n&gt; Nuff said!\n&gt;\n&gt;  Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; From: paranormalinvestiga ting@hotmail. com\n&gt; Date: Fri, 16 Nov 2007 13:17:01 +0000\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] for rod or eric or whatever your name is\n&gt;\n&gt; You have been a member of this group since 2004 and still have no\n&gt; idea what it&#39;s about ? As far as me not watching ghost shows on tv,\n&gt; it seems by your explanation of how you have been involved in the PI\n&gt; field that you are a lot like those cheesy ghost hunting shows. To\n&gt; make a statement that spirits are not interactive and could care less\n&gt; about us or what we are trying to do, that alone shows you know\n&gt; nothing. I am a disabled rescue worker injured in the 911 attacks and\n&gt; am home all day with plenty of time for research and I can\n&gt; imphatically tell you that they do pay attention they do interact\n&gt; they are definitely interested and they are working harder than we\n&gt; are to communicate.\n&gt;\n&gt; maybe you have formed your opinion because in your vast wealth of\n&gt; knowledge and experience you have never come across a spirit that was\n&gt; interested in you. besides throwing you all around a room or lifting\n&gt; you into the air and hurling you like a shot put or whatever you\n&gt; claim some ghosts did. And if they did do that to you that sounds\n&gt; pretty interactive to me. I can see why they would want to throw you\n&gt; around and kick and bite you but if I where you I would find another\n&gt; hobby.\n&gt; and I say hobby because by your analogy of it that&#39;s all it is to you.\n&gt;\n&gt; As far as your friend with the mini box, yeah I&#39;m not stupid I\n&gt; figured that out, you can stop trying to defend it no one here is\n&gt; gonna buy that piece of crap.\n&gt;\n&gt; I will not trade any more malicious posts with you so don&#39;t bother.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Climb to the top of the charts!
