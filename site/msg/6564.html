Hiya =

You just post your files to the esnips account. Then if you want pe=
ople to get special notices you can add them as members by email or add as =
friends thru esnips. Make the folders/files public access and its open to t=
he esnips community (theres quite a few over there) as well as the group fo=
rum here. You just say here you posted your files same as you always do and=
 give the link and they can go and check them out even if its a 50 meg file=
. 
It's pretty cool and it has alot of options. We use it to post ITC pictu=
res and share big EVP collections or just keep up with some of the massive =
amount of results each other gets. 
 
Its better than alot of pay services =
Ive seen, and the fact that its free just makes it that much better. Alot o=
f people are not computer saavy. But I simply email them the link, and when=
 they click on it and visit my gallery or whatever I have set up for them t=
o view, they automatically just verified thier email account is real. So th=
en when they decide to join the signup is instant and they can begin the pr=
ocess of uploading immediately. It makes it so much easier for them to figu=
re out how to do things.
 
Your folder options are endless. You can make on=
e for each box, and then make subfolders that are dated in each one. It all=
ows descriptions or comments for each file.
 
I used it to highlight differ=
ent methods of recording and I didnt even come close to covering them all. =
This group has alot of methods going on, we just need more file space to sh=
are them. You will figure it out, just make a public folder, upload a coupl=
e files, and send us a link. It tells you what the link is for the folder a=
nd even allows you to change it if you wish.

Thanks Bruce. My wish is that we had unlimited posting/filin=
g space. But til then we will have to make do with what we have. Try the es=
nips thing out several of us are already over there forming our lil communi=
ty for file sharing. With 50 gigs you can pretty much post in whatever form=
at you like which is what we do. Some files are just too large to post here=
 or too many of them to post all at once so we just use that instead.
 
Plu=
s its easy to link up with others so that they get notifications you have u=
ploaded a new file. I think for now its a great way to expand our group and=
 possibly even reach more people who havent joined here or even heard of th=
e things we do. It also keeps a hit count for how many people visit your fo=
lders so you can see what people are listening to. And it allows comments s=
o that visitors can give feedback if they wish.
