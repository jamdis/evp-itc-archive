Unit only works off a 9 volt battery...no ac or other dc options possible.  My battery goes down fast and they are not cheap and I know of no way to recharge this type of battery.  Also, the battery seems to drain even when not used (I mentioned this to Bill).\n\n2.  Mode selection at times does not change the mode when button is pressed.  I often have to push the mode select many times to get it to move to the next mode.\n\n3.  Dictonary mode seems to not offer anything but repeat words.  Have not checked this very closely yet but I hear repeating words and names...especially... Larry...often.  I have no confidence in this mode.\n\n4.  The phonemes and mix mode seem very limited in that I often do not get any &quot;energy&quot; reading to allow sounds to be emitted. Although I try to conduct my sessions in a calm mode myself, apparently I don&#39;t have enough energy around me to get a consistant energy reading. \n\n5.  Never tested other modes to determine value or usefulness except for the yes/no and I found this to be totally out of touch.  Somethng like McCain...sorry.\n\nI do intend to work with the concepts Jeff put forth...but first I need to go buy more batteries.  Also, I will dig out a clip I have from one of my sessions and post it hear.  Maybe you can help me with translation.  Ron"}
