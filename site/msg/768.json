At least there&#39;s some other&#39;s work that tends \nto back up mine.\n\nFrank\n\n\n&gt;From: LON3_S7AR &lt;lon3_s7ar@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: evp-itc@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] sonia background noise\n&gt;Date: Fri, 23 Feb 2007 07:49:39 -0800 (PST)\n&gt;\n&gt;    im sure youve got this, but just incase\n&gt;\n&gt;http://aaevp.com/resources/resources2.htmBackground    Sound\n&gt;          Portuguese    Language Crowd Babble\n&gt;          In the search for an effective    background sound source, crowd \n&gt;babble has proven to be one of the more    effective. Brazilian ITC \n&gt;researcher, Sonia Rinaldi, made this Portuguese    language crowd babble \n&gt;sound track available to the AA-EVP. We have    reversed it and clipped any \n&gt;outstanding vocalization so that just a    steady flow of voice frequency \n&gt;sound is heard. It is only 30 seconds, so    you will want to either copy \n&gt;and paste several times to make the file    longer or play it in a loop.   \n&gt;Download this    mp3 file here.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Amy Sutter\n&gt;\n&gt;www.myspace.com/LON3_S7AR\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------\n&gt;Access over 1 million songs - Yahoo!
