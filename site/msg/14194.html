If the audio had been resampled, you could expect less bytes, or different =
bytes, but not the same number of the same bytes.=A0 That's why comparing t=
he bytes in both files can rule that out, if no changes are found.

I just don't fully trust the bit =

      They are no=
t necessarily the same bytes, but I was 
        proposing a quick check ju=
st to see if the files were in the same 
        ballpark.=A0 Look at it th=
e other way: if the number of bytes were 
        DIFFERENT, than you'd kno=
w the files HAD changed, and you could stop 
        testing.=A0 But if the=
 number of bytes are the same, it tends to 
        indicate the files are =
likely the same, but you still need a low level 
        file comparison to=
 be sure.

My method is to compare the files 
        using the CMP command=
 in unix.=A0 There are many programs to compare 
        files, but you hav=
e to be careful not to use one that does a 
        line-by-line compare (o=
r a comparison meant for text files), since text 
        files can be diff=
erent at a low level, but look essential the same in an 
        editor (be=
cause of the way spaces and tabs and new lines work between 
        editor=
s and platforms).

But anyway, the way to compare is with a 
        progra=
m that can compare binary files, not text files.

          information.=A0 For example, if I had a

This kind of compression 
        =
                        does things like looking for common patterns in

replace

When the

                                uncompressed, and all occu=
rences of $HN1 are 
                                replaced with "Howdy Ne=

                            The real test is compring the con=
tents.  
                            Identical contents means indentic=

If you'd like me to help test

                            lossy compres=
