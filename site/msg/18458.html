<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It is interesting that you posted this because I was thinking of asking the group if using the box, a digital recorder, EVP Maker, and the like created any odd occurences in your home. I have had things happen and it always seems to be after I have spent some time trying to communicate with one of those methods. Does this kind of communication bring spirits into your home? Has anyone else had similar experiences to Rick?
Thanks,
Country

&gt; things...I don&#x27;t take everything I hear as spirit,if I catch it on EVP and it&#x27;s 
&gt; clear I&#x27;ll take it under my wing for some sort of response,BUT on the other hand 
&gt; We&#x27;re getting our names called and asnwers to &quot;Do You Know Where You Are ?&quot; An d 
&gt; the response made us stop and wonder...reponse was &quot;In the basement&quot;......HELLO 
&gt; we&#x27;re in the Basement......Also I believe it will bring out the EVIL 
&gt; SIDE...which we did..and both my house as well as our partners seems to have 
&gt; someone that has followed us,turning on lights in the kitchen and opening the 
&gt; kitchen cabinets up,It made me feel sick all day and affected our cat...not to 
&gt; mention simular things at our partners home...Be careful what you say and ask 
&gt; for...cause you might get more than you want.....Love Ya Frank....Rick
