 I see 'death' clouds like this before just aobut every natural disaster, =
most of the time they are much clear, and look like shulls. Oftne they appe=
ar only as th eeye sockets from the skulls. It's almost as easy to catch th=
ese in pix as it is to get UFOs. Right after this I heard about another fat=
ality int a tornado. Thre sky has been full of these clouds this year. 
 
 =
There is also frequently symbols, some almost look like Mayan, but I don't =
understand them. I think the whole universe tries to communicate in whateve=
r is available.
