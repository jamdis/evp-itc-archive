Hi everyone,

 

I am new to this group also. I have been experimenting wi=
th ITC for about 6 months now, with fairly good results from a basic radio =
shack hack. I am hoping to learn more about the set up of other devices and=
 maybe gain some more technical knowledge from this group.

Hi Marie. Welcome to the group. I enjoy manual sweep tuni=
ng and have had some great results including direct responses using that me=
thod. I think when they use my name (first middle and last) constantly that=
 kind of throws out the randomness idea most skeptics have. But usually it =
takes people hearing thier own names and info to wonder if there is more to=
 it.
