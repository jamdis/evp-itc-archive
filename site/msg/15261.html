<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I see that one of my posted links does not work. Here is the direct link to the audio file http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/sCJMSmFQCZRlREQ8hYyZ1IRnFzg61dvmaUjNfdEe9UBhZ8lmfNNZUMsLEEEmcsMI5aO6Mdw_ZCplE6SS3NQ8CvoJWEJnId3KKA/Jim%27s%20RR-DR60%20EVP%27s/MIKES-DEAD-2-EVP.mp3 This one has a little girl that says &quot;Mikes Dead&quot; then a man says &quot;Oh Shit......I&#x27;ll go get .......&quot; Not sure WHO he goes to get but sounds like the words Cherilyn possibly. I first thought there we 3 voices here. But after hearing many times it is only 2 voices. The little girl saying &quot;Mikes Dead&quot; and then the guy yelling &quot;Oh Shit......I&#x27;ll go get.........&quot; I think I read that the children were not at the Mansion. Not sure on this now as I have tried to find information either way without success. I do AGREE with others, these cannot be affirmed as being from Michael Jackson as there are &quot;tricksters&quot; on the other side...as here on Earth :) But I did ask for PROOF in this recording and found this later on playback (much later in my recording of 4 minutes) but still doesn&#x27;t really mean anything. This would need to be considered a &quot;natural&quot; enviromental recording because it sounds like the &quot;EVENT&quot; when someone actually found he was dead. BUT it was not recorded at the actual area. I got this 5 days later (June 30th) at Pioneer Park in Des Moines Iowa.</pre>
