My name is Tim Wise.  I am a lead investigator\n&gt; for the Bluegrass Ghost Chasers in Frankfort, KY.  I recently found\n&gt; the video instructions by UFO geek on the hack for the RS 12-469 radio\n&gt; and have built myself a small Ghost box.  I&#39;ve become intrigued with\n&gt; the prospect of taking this with the group on investigations and\n&gt; should have a chance to take it with me to Waverly Hills Sanatorium\n&gt; late next month.  I also found this group through Mike&#39;s Blog site. \n&gt; Any and all tips and opinions will be greatly appreciated and if I\n&gt; come up with anything I&#39;ll make sure and share with this group.\n&gt;"}
