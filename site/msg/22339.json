So if you have some kind of grudge against the JREF, I suspect any facts I try to post are not going to sit well with you.  So I&#39;ll end my help at this point.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Dave Koenig &lt;floridajakeblues@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Director from19 97 to 2008 .. Co- founder of the group ..
