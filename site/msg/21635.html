Here is where, "Christ holds the baby" and I was told that either Casey or  
Casey told her daughter to "count to one thousand" this last one says on 
one  side, "yep, taped her mouth," and it's reverse says, "put in garage" it 
might  have been that she put her in the car trunk to die when she backed the 
car into  the garage. sf
