<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Are you talking about the Speakjet?  See the video halfway down this page:

http://www.keyportparanormal.com/ghostboxsamplevideos.html

Also, just a heads up:  I think it&#x27;s kind of frowned upon to call the entities &quot;demons.&quot;  Even &quot;spirits&quot; can be questioned in some circles, as there seems to be evidence not all of those we talk to have lived as a human being on earth.

&gt; Hi group!
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ve just been approved, and can&#x27;t wait to learn more about the EVP field,
&gt; as I&#x27;m very interested in it, and the Paranormal. :-)
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Without getting too OT, I hope, can some kind soul tell me what other
&gt; similar devices there are to this? I recall seeing one such box that a
&gt; spirit/demon communicates with a synthesized voice using only 1 word. I
&gt; think this one will be very helpful to me as well, as I begin my Paranormal
&gt; research career.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance, and eagerly looking forward to learning from all of you.
&gt; 
&gt;
