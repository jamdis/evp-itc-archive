I have to admit that I thought I had seen the worst 'paranormal' show on te=
levision already. I was wrong. Door to the Dead has exceeded my worst expec=
tations.

Generally, I respect John Oliver's work as a medium. While I have=
 no personal experience with him, in the past he has looked and acted more =
genuine than not, the rolling of the eyes put aside for the moment.

I do t=
ake exception to the characterization of the talking box as an Edison devic=
e. I have documented the history of Edison, ITC and EVP=A0=A0elsewhere. Thi=
s is however the smallest concern I have with this show.

Prior to wathcing=
 I had just had a conversation with a respected colleague on the West coast=
 regarding interesting phenomena he and others are constantly observing in =
sites with phenomena similar to that on Door to the Dead. None of those mea=
surements were made by this team. The use of thermal in this situation is n=
ot indicated as well.

The real concern is that no attempt was made to help=
 this family in a broader context. The skeptic did and said nothing skeptic=
al as far as I could tell. Key questions were not asked (at least on-camera=
) that would reveal the psycho-dynamics of this family. We know fairly well=
 at this time that PK phenomena is often centered on a focal person who can=
 exhibit specific characteristics. That the team seems unaware of this is q=
uite disturbing to a person like myself.

A real research opportunity was l=
ost in this case, as was an opportunity to educate the public on the right =
way to approach such situations. Continually sending the messages that phen=
omena is based on 'demons' and 'spirits' exclusively does nothing to furthe=
r the position of serious investigators, which is perhaps most troubling of=
 all.
