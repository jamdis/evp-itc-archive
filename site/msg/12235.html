<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am so sorry Tammi I know you and your family must be devastated. I send much love and light your way to guide you!!!

And a simple warning. This is quite a large group of genuine helpful people however there are a few out there (you know who you are I wont name names) who think its ok to charge people money to do a session for them in thier time of grief so please ignore anyone who would even think about trying to solicit you or gain a profit off it. 

I personally frown upon that tactic.

There are also many caring individuals in the community who may step forward to try and be of assistance. At no charge. Just hoping anything could help your family. 

HUGGGZZZ

Misty
