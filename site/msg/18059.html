One of the points of that first experment was to shake out the bugs.=C2=A0 =
Now that everyone has seen the monitor, we should be good for the next run,=
 if that was an issue for anyone.

BTW, I didn't hear 'radio' in your files=
, but that's not important.=C2=A0 It's just what you all say the object is =
during the timeframe.

                I think it does m=
atter though. 

One of 
                  the things we're trying to do is =
set up an objective framework 
                  for experimenting with som=
e of these aspects.=C2=A0 I think we 
                  have all experience=
d the difficulty in hearing what is on some 
                  of these rec=
ordings: sometimes we're not sure at first what it 
                  says.=
 Sometimes we ask others for their input.=C2=A0 Sometimes 
                =
  we only hear it once someone else tells us it first.=C2=A0 
             =
     Sometimes we hear it wrong.=C2=A0 Sometimes we hear it right. 
       =
           And so on.

It would be useful to know, as an 
                 =
 individual, how good we are at hearing it right, so we have 
             =
     some idea how trustworthy our skill, or methods, or 
                 =
 technology, is.=C2=A0 If we can measure that, or even get a 
             =
     feel for it, we can look for ways to improve it.=C2=A0 If we 
        =
          can't measure it, then we could be stuck.=C2=A0 

So, by 
       =
           restricting the answers only to the timeframe of the 
          =
        experiment, we can help filter out some of the problems of 
       =
           subjectivity: for example, one theory is that people can hear 
 =
                 what they want to hear, or can these sounds in a certain w=
ay, 
                  once you already know the answer.=C2=A0 Or, given 2 =
ways to 
                  hear a sound, being influenced, even subconsciou=
sly, to hear 
                  it one way over the other.=C2=A0 We want to=
 rule that 
                  out.

This is one reason we can only count on=
 answers 
                  given during the timeframe.=C2=A0 That is when =
the answer is 
                  most objective.=C2=A0 Once the object has =
been announced, we 
                  move into a=C2=A0 period where we can=
't discount possible 
                  influence from already knowing the =
answer.

But, I am 
                  confident that if a person's method o=
r technology really can 
                  reveal the correct answer outsid=
e the timeframe, then doing it 
                  within the timeframe shou=
ld be just as easy, and would then be 
                  a valid objective =
result for all to see.

                  time. The experiment was for participants to 
           =
                     determine what it was. Vague or partial answers 
     =
                           wouldn't be counted (for example, just colors, 
=
                                shapes, sizes, what it's made of, etc): we'=
re 
                                looking for what it is. Participants co=

In order to 
                                keep me honest, I took a pictu=
re of the object 
                                at the start of the exper=
iment and loaded it to 
                                the Files section (=
RJ folder) of this group. If 
                                you can follo=
w the link, it is here:

http://tech. 
                                grou=
ps.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ 
                                RJ/RJ.=
20100710. 1.zip

The idea was 
                                that you cou=
ld download the file at the 
                                beginning of t=
he test, and 'keep it safe' on 
                                your comput=
er. Then at the end of the test, I 
                                would r=
elease the password so you could reveal 
                                th=
e contents of the file. That way, you were in 
                            =
    control of the original image during the entire 
                      =
          test, not me. 

The password for that file 
                     =
           is: 123BlastOff
Instructions, if you need 
                     =
           them, are also in that RJ folder.

And if 
                     =
           you did not care to download the zip file before 
              =
                  the test, I will post the final image there 
            =
                    too.

So to the results:

Number of 
                  =
              participants: 5
Total tries: 8
Ambiguous 
                   =
             answers: 0
Correct answers: 0

Object: 
                      =
          A radio
Uzipped picture:

                            =
    RJ/RJ.20100710. 1.JPG

So what do the 
                                =
results mean? All that we can really agree on 
                            =
    from this experiment is that no participant, 
                         =
       with whatever theories or methods or technology 
                   =
             they used, was able to correctly determine the 
              =
                  object. We can't say those theories or methods 
         =
                       or technologies never work. Just as we can't say 
  =
                              they do. Just that, for whatever reason, they=
 
                                did not work this time. Readers can take =
the 
                                results, use them to improve or change=
 their 
                                methods, or keep doing what they're=
 
                                doing.

If anyone has any observations, 
=
                                comments, or ideas for improvement, let me =
know. 
                                I hope to get a new experiment up an=
d running 
                                soon. Since there wasn't much pa=
rticipation 
                                Mon-Wed, I think the next expe=
riment will be

                                weekends.
