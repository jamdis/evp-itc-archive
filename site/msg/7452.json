It is in\n&gt; &gt; fact the inspiration for my boxes. 2-The Mini box by\n&gt; &gt; paranormalsystems.com. It&#39;s a direct output, linear sweep system \n&gt; based\n&gt; &gt; on my boxes, and it does work. 3-Use the manual sweep mathod, take \n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; radio that can be tuned easily by hand, tune the dial up and down\n&gt; &gt; slowly while recording directly from the speaker. Always announce \n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; are doing an EVP session before you start recording. Manual sweep \n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; the basis for linear sweep that the Mini box uses, and that I have\n&gt; &gt; adopted for my boxes, and was first developed here on this group. \n&gt; 3-\n&gt; &gt; Foreign language-Tune in a short wave broadcast in a language you\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t understand, and record directly from the speaker of the radio.\n&gt; &gt; You can also use an internet foreign language boroadcast for the \n&gt; same\n&gt; &gt; purpose. See coffeepotghost.com for more information. 4-Radio \n&gt; between\n&gt; &gt; stations as a source of white noise. I like to pick a night when \n&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; lots of skip, stations fadding in and oput randomly, this is a great\n&gt; &gt; source of raw audio. You&#39;ll have ignore the critics that cliam \n&gt; you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; only hearing broadcast fragments, you hav eto judge the result by\n&gt; &gt; meaning, that is, does the message mean anything personally? I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; sure there&#39;s other methods out on the web. I suggest peole start \n&gt; wiht\n&gt; &gt; white noise, and work your way up. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is nothing magical about the boxes, it&#39;s a swept radio,\n&gt; &gt; nothing more. It provides a higher level--louder--audio that spirits\n&gt; &gt; use to make voices, that is all it does! I usually do not ask\n&gt; &gt; questions when I do sessions, I think that biases the mind into\n&gt; &gt; expecting, and maybe even creating the answers one wants the hear. I\n&gt; &gt; rely on the guides to give me what I need. I also don&#39;t do\n&gt; &gt; &quot;investigations&quot;, again I think it biases your mind into creating \n&gt; what\n&gt; &gt; you want. I really doubt there is any haunting if no one is there to\n&gt; &gt; experience it.
