&gt; I&#x27;ve seen live webcast of ITC sessions where GB output is fed directly into
&gt; the mic line in on a computer running Adobe Audition with the spectragraph
&gt; running. It was really compelling to see letters and numbers, not images or
&gt; pictures, but partial words appear in the graph. At first it was I thought
&gt; it was a software glitch but it is a repeatable event. It was on LiveSciFi
&gt; which is run by Tim Wood, he also thought there was some kind of code error
&gt; but it happened on more than one webcast.
&gt;
&gt; So if anyone has Audition, just feed Box output right in your computer and
&gt; see what happens. I wanted to try it tonight but I have Audacity and the
&gt; spectragraph feature doesn&#x27;t have that shaded appearance that Audition does
&gt; so it&#x27;s not able to render images or characters, at least as far as I see
&gt; using the various settings.

&gt; &gt; I have tried numerous EVP files and short box clips and so far
&gt; &gt; nothing discernible has appeared on either program. I still have a lot of
&gt; &gt; hope though.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but I am going to try to work this in to a
&gt; &gt; session tonight!
