I clicked on the yellow play \nbutton, and I got a Wave out Error that says &quot;The specified format is \nnot supported or can not be translated.  Use the Capabilities function \nto determine the support formates&quot;.  Then I thought since I had wave \npad open that was the problem, but I shut wave pad down.  Its still is \nsaying the same thing.  I am trying to use it on Windows 2000 \nProfessional on my Home cpu.  Please let me know if there is away I can \nfix my problem.  \n\nEVP maker works on my laptop, but not my home cpu.\n\nThanks \n\nRees"}
