Mr. Sumption, I would like very much like to receive information as to acquiring one of your Boxes. I am a serious, independant Paranormal researcher, Not! a de-tractor of your instrument, not by any means. I mention this here because I've followed the various exchanges of information, and "information," concerning your instrument. I've reviewed the sound bytes posted and am very impressed with the results. I would appreciate a responce, one way or the other, from you at your convenience. Thank you in advance.   --Rod

about it shutting off aplliances, I thought those ran on internal batteries. 
Maybe you're getting a lesson in energies?

I did get a quake warning in last nights test, it said China suffers a 
quake, followed by August 11. I usually don't get dates, or locations, so I 
guess wait any see, of maybe they can evacuate China? Often, when a quake is 
coming I get a wolf image, well there's a wolf face on the shower window, 
kind of a medium size wolf, so I think if there is a quake it won't be real 
severe, maybe like a 6 or 7. Wolves for quakes, cats for wind, and bears for 
tsunamis, which I didn't know ahead of time. For Katrina I had a cat(image) 
with huge round eyes.
