I agree, as I sent a private email to Frank, if one of them were  hurting, 
either one of them if a comet hit this Earth, I am sure  either one of them 
would reach out to save each other's life, people say things  about each 
other when they get angry without meaning to, it's more of a personal  hurt 
inside the self, it was wrong to send this is silly.  The only reason  I came 
back was because I did not have Frank's address, now I do, so If I get  
kicked off this list by anyone, so be it, but the reason I did come back was  
because Spirit were giving me Frank's full name I thought it might be someone 
he  knew asking for him.  God Bless Us one and all,  sf
