But, one could almost \nwrite a novel just listening to what they  say.  Had a little conversation \ngoing by 3 or 4 of them, all because I fell  asleep, what can i say, i was up \nlate last night into morning hours, and up  early this morning, so, I don&#39;t \nget much sleep.  Heard them yaking away,  clearly, everyone, all kinds of \ntalking, about everything you can imagine.   Almost sounds like I have company \nout there, I think they get stronger if they  are on, for awhile. Lots of \nmovement out there in the front room right now.  sf \n\r\n--part1_f82c3.ce68374.3aa95137_boundary\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3DUS-ASCII&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Type&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18702&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot; id=3Drole_body =\r\n bottomMargin=3D7 leftMargin=3D7 rightMargin=3D7 topMargin=3D7&gt;&lt;FONT id=3Dr=\r\nole_document  color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Oh, they are terr=\r\nible, lol&nbsp; &quot;where&#39;s Bonnie, she&#39;s sleeping, \ndreaming,&quot; &quot;wake her!&nbs=\r\np; &quot;She&#39;ll be up all night&quot;&nbsp; I&#39;ll try, &quot;is she up \nyet?&nbsp; &quot;no,&quot; &n=\r\nbsp;&quot; I tried,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;almost&quot; &quot;nothing, not even and \nearth quake can=\r\n move her, &quot;&nbsp; I was in my room with the door open, left the \ntv on for=\r\n them today, i don&#39;t turn them on much, maybe once or twice a week \nanymore=\r\n.&nbsp; But, one could almost write a novel just listening to what they \nsa=\r\ny.&nbsp; Had a little conversation going by 3 or 4 of them, all because I f=\r\nell \nasleep, what can i say, i was up late last night into morning hours, a=\r\nnd up \nearly this morning, so, I don&#39;t get much sleep.&nbsp; Heard them yak=\r\ning away, \nclearly, everyone, all kinds of talking, about everything you ca=\r\nn imagine.&nbsp; \nAlmost sounds like I have company out there, I think they=\r\n get stronger if they \nare on, for awhile.
