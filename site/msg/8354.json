You can do this by using\nthe Open button, or simply by &quot;drag&#39;n&#39;drop&quot; the file into EVPmaker. Next\ncheck &quot;Use Cue List&quot;, and click on the button with the yellow arrow to\nstart playback. You can record the sound as usual to any\ncassette/digital recorder or even into a recording software on the same\ncomputer.\n\nIn my short test last night, I used the &quot;EVP Session&quot; function, which\nhowever didn&#39;t record my own voice - but it was the easiest way to test\nit. Using &quot;EVP Session&quot; is a bit complicated to explain, but it&#39;s all\nwritten in the manual... ;-)\n\nHope this helps...\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Steve or Stefan - can one you email me as well.  I downloaded the EVPM and I\n&gt; saved the speakjet tones to a wav file.  Now what????\n\n&gt; Any help for the feebly inept technological wannabe that is me would be\n&gt; great! :-)\n\n&gt; Thanks,\n\n&gt; Kristin\n\n \n\n&gt;   _____  \n\n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\n&gt; Stefan Bion\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, March 26, 2008 3:44 PM\n&gt; To: Steve Hultay\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: EVP maker\n\n \n\n&gt; Thanks, Steve.
