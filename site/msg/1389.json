(Well, I like the term &quot;paranormal investigator&quot; better!)\n\nI&#39;ve gotten a lot of EVP&#39;s on a pocket DVR but I found and downloaded the \nschematics for Frank&#39;s ghost box some months ago.  I&#39;m fascinated by this \nidea and I hope I can find the time to build the equipmeont some time \nsoon. Hopefully I will get beyond the 70-80 hour work weeks I&#39;ve been \nputting in for the last couple months ...\n\nLooking forward to seeing what&#39;s happening on this group!\n\nZack"}
