If you lose anything, just log in to their site and all your stuff is there.  All you have to do is click recover files and it all goes right back on to your hard drive.\n\nThe name of the program is Carbonite, it&#39;s $59 a year with unlimited space.\n\nJust &quot;right click&quot; one of your folders and click &quot;back up folder&quot;.  That&#39;s it, very easy to use.\n\nHere is the web page:\n\nhttp://www.carbonite.com/\n\nAnother option is to back up your stuff onto DVD&#39;s.  Depending on how much stuff you have, a blank DVD can hold 4.7gb of space on one disc.\n\n-Steve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Everyone please be careful with file storage, I had lost most all of mine  \n&gt; because my back up drive failed, I can&#39;t get them back, i lost the MFR, and \n&gt; I  don&#39;t know what to do now, lost all, my family and horse pictures, music  \n&gt; collection, all the spirit files, all my saved Theme collection, a program \n&gt; I can  never get back, so, please everyone, make at least two different back \n&gt; up  drives. sf\n&gt;"}
