well. 

I tend to run my own experiments without thought of what someone else 
will think about it so I will let ya know if they come by this way. I 
usually dont post newly crossed people out of respect to the family 
involved. I share it when the time seems right.

As for those who think it takes "time" for newly deceased to come 
thru, I tend to think it is us that needs time to heal because they 
have continually said "time does not exist" for them. It is a manmade 
function we place on ourselves due to environment and daily function 
as well as measure of life span.

I did get a Cathy coming thru repeatedly lately but not sure 
which/who she is for. Either way she just says she loves her dog 
and "this is a proper hehe mom" 

And a Tom-Son dunno who they are either. Toms son, thompson, no clue. 
all they said was "whos an alligator Tom-Son" I am bad when i dont 
recognize it or understand it so I just go phonetically for those. So 
I may be a lil off on what they say/mean.

And a Jason and a Jordan. Jasons statement sounded british he said " 
well sugar I love my mummys sunday" something. Jordan's statement was 
about someone (Chris) not killing themselves saying it was Bullsh*t. 

I dont know these spirits/people so all I can do is document and move 
on. But if yours pop up I will forward them your way.
