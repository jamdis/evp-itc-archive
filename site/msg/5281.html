<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for explanation, Juli -- Because I&#x27;m relatively new to boxes, 
I&#x27;m not quite up to speed on the terminology.  I&#x27;ve copied your log 
sheet and will re-name &quot;Research Conducting Session&quot; to &quot;Group 
Session&quot; on my log sheet.

&gt; Thanks Sharon!
&gt;                              I labled the Research Conducting 
Session for those who are doing sessions via Skype, or dual persons 
via different locations.  Sometimes me and Joel do sessions together 
or by ourselves.  I know Bruce and Steve also conduct dual sessions.  
I can change the title if it is confusing.  I was hoping that once we 
dedcide to conduct various sessions on the same day and time would 
could name them accordingly such as Research Project_____/ (example) 
Conducted by:__________.
&gt;    
&gt;                             I hope this helps!
&gt;    
&gt;   Thanks!

&gt;           Thanks for sharing your log sheet Juli. It&#x27;s quite 
complete; the 
&gt; only thing I might add is the mood/state of mind of the researcher. 
&gt; Also, what do you mean by Research Conducting Session?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again,
&gt; Sharon

&gt; &gt; Hi Everyone!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I just uploaded a Box Research Log Sheet to our 
&gt; files. 
&gt; &gt; There are 2 there, one in PDF Format and the other in Word. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; When I conduct a session I use this sheet to log 
&gt; &gt; important information and questions I will be asking during the 
&gt; session 
&gt; &gt; and after. Feel free to use it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In addition, if you think there should be any 
&gt; &gt; additional items added, please let me know.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks!
&gt; &gt; Juli
