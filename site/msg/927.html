Yes many crash and burn in this field, again I feel it has to do with the individual resonation/vibration as to what is allowed to come thru or have an effect. One of my early evp's was "you have no fear" and it's true I do not. There is nothing they can say or do or show me that would harm my psyche. They did that a long time ago, with dreams of a death weeks before it happened that I couldnt stop. But this work, this research I am conducting now has alleviated the stress of any previous incidents in my lifetime. I know the murder wasnt my fault, nothing I could have done to change it even tho I tried back then to stop it. I understand more of what happened to me as a child surrounded by the paranormal. 
   
  Fear is a protective impulse to shield against the negative. However if you have fear then you are subject to attack by those who would wish to scare you. My advice to people is have no fear and if you do.. find something else to do besides this type of work. 
   
  A bit like firewalking, who will get burned the guy who walks across as if strolling thru a field or the guy who is waiting for the "burning" to start. I am not afraid of death. I am positive my body will die and the method is just a non issue once the first part of the statement has been accepted.
