  You can di=
sagree, I will let'cha! LOL I think this is a misunderstanding between us o=
nce again. The whole point of the communication is to bring about the spiri=
tual evolution of mankind. To convince not us but others that their is an e=
xistence greater than the small petty worlds we have created around ourselv=
es. They mean to increase our humanity, tolerance to change, and unconditio=
nal love for one another so that we can join that existence with comfort. T=
he very same communications you are getting from Mike and Lisa, you are get=
ting by way of influence through your spiritual connection to them and many=
 others who remain silent.

  It is our job to spread the word to as many t=
hat will listen of what we have learned. Not to just sit in our extra bedro=
oms, garages, attics or whatever and test different combinations of radios =
and misc circuitry. The positive messages are what is important not the equ=
ipment. We need to change people's attitudes.

  Frank,
   
  I have to disagree.
  =
I believe they have a purpose for putting so much effort into relating this=
 communication in the hopes
  that we will strive to better the communicati=
on so as to get better and clearer messages that convey their precise inten=
tion.
   
  Mike and Lisa have told me how difficult it is to transmit this=
 communication and they have a sense of urgency in their messages
  trying =
to make us sit up and take notice. 
   
  I would hate to believe they do n=
ot care about the outcome of man kind and ignore our problems, no matter ho=
w petty they may seem
  to a higher being. there has to be a method and an =
end to their means. I don't think they are participating in this miraculous=
 communication for entertainment.
   
  If I am misunderstanding your meani=
ng, which has happened to us in the past. Please let me know.

    Bruce,

    The powers that be on the =

    LC,

    to let mankind know there is something bigger =

    Maybe if the powers that be could hear that with =
