This is where I \nusually go, once around the Lake to get 30 miles, twice for 40 miles. That \nincludes the distance from home and back. This is looking south, toward \nalong the foot hills of the Rockies. The Choke Cherries are just getting \nripe, so I brough back maybe four pounds that I picked along the bike trail.\n\nFrank-S\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMessenger Caf� � open for fun 24/7.
