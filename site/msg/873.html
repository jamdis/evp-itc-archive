I have a very sensitive old AM tuner with a flywheel tuning system. I tried several recording sessions manually sweeping the tuner through the AM band late at night. I got pretty good at keeping the dial moving at a constant rate of speed. This is not nearly as good as Frank's 'hands off' random tuning method but it still produced some results. What impressed me most is that some of the voices sound the same, even though I tuned through several channels. This attached capture could be a technical message.
"Plug a million hertz" One Million Hertz = 1mhz = 1000khz, which is close the center frequency for the AM broadcast band.
