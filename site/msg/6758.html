Good point LC.   You did get responses that the whole group could witness and participate in.  I would guess the outcome would be quite different for participants if the message could only be heard by the conductor or the messages were not readily discernible.  I am not doing group presentations...yet...and I would hesitate at this point to share a session with other than my wife, who already knows I'm out there.  Cheers   Ron L

When I ran a group (5 of us) session two weeks ago, I had members of 
the group formulate questions and I did the asking for about an 8 
minute session or so. They could not hear the responses aloud, as I 
had the audio piped directly into a mixer, then outputted to the 
recorder (but I could hear & had on headphones to listen in).

I immediately then uploaded the audio to my laptop, and began playing 
the audio aloud, allowing the group to help me analyze what we had 
captured. We received great messages that were not lower level, but 
sentences of information (not just "hi," "yes," "no," etc). 

So, I would like to add to this discussion that group sessions can 
work well, but it may depend on how you do it and what the intentions 
are.

someone who takes the time to see such a presentation also wants to

be underestimated. Hope this helps. Thanks again for the 
videos. Ron L
