I agree in that much of EVP is just pareidolia, or the listener hearing wha=
t he wants to hear. But I disagree in that PK is responsible for most true =
EVPs.

    If we presume that much of what=
 is heard is in fact the result of personal PK and not a discarnate voice, =
we may have an answer to the question of why some sourcse communicate and o=
thers do not.

  I would suggest that while the operator may produce the vo=
ice phenomena, that operator may indeed be influenced by external agents. T=
his could include discarnate agents. 

  When you carefully consider what i=
s being heard, the themes often seem to reflect what may be subconscious co=
ncerns of the operator or the listener. If external sources additionally in=
form this process of perception, it is quite possible they influence both w=
hat is recorded and how is later perceived. This would also nicely explain =
why some people hear the same things on a recording while others hear quite=
 different things and more importantly while one person hears different thi=
ngs from the same recording at different times.

  It would also remove the=
 requirement that discarnates manifest the phenomena. If discarnates are in=
deed non-physical, it is unclear how they would modify the physical world. =
On the other hand, we have good evidence demonstrating the ability of livin=
g individuals to alter their environments in profound ways, apparently with=
 their minds. So it seems to make more sense that this might indeed by the =
underlying mechanism to EVPs rather than discarnate manipulations.
