<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just an Olympus VN960PC pocket DVR. This was in the Morgan Building of the 
former Manteno IL State Mental Hospital.  There was so much going on that 
I just left the recorder running the whole time.  Got lots of random EVP 
comments as well as answers to directed questions.

&gt; I got some EVP in a very haunted place that were spoken at approximately
&gt; twice the normal speed. Slowing them down to half-speed wuth Audacity
&gt; produced what sounded like a normal rate of speech.
&gt;
&gt; Try to figure out how they did that!

&gt;&gt; I was highly skeptical, and highly critical of box-type communication.
&gt;&gt; I began looking all over the internet, youtube, etc... wondering why
&gt;&gt; people put so much stock into these specialized tuners or modified
&gt;&gt; radios. It then occurred to me that I was being skeptical of something
&gt;&gt; that I have never sat down and tried. Not having much money, I went
&gt;&gt; with the shack hack method. My first session was phenomenal, and
&gt;&gt; although I don&#x27;t know how mystery voices can accurately and
&gt;&gt; contextually answer my questions posed to what is, in effect, a
&gt;&gt; malfunctioning radio, I am only left with the knowledge that it works.
&gt;&gt; At least it worked for me. Believe me, it drives me insane trying to
&gt;&gt; figure out the mechanism by which spirits would be able to communicate
&gt;&gt; with a box spitting out chunks of broadcast fragments. That being
&gt;&gt; said, though, it really isn&#x27;t anymore of a leap of faith than the
&gt;&gt; coil-induction theory of evp collection, I mean, how would a spirit
&gt;&gt; know how to manipulate focused emf fields to produce corresponding
&gt;&gt; frequency.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As to what the voices might be, I have to say as far as I am
&gt;&gt; concerned, the jury is still out. I am wondering if there isn&#x27;t some
&gt;&gt; sort of latent PK element in play by the operator, it would certainly
&gt;&gt; explain why the information is so accurate and specific. I am working
&gt;&gt; on a &quot;blind&quot; test to study that to my own satisfaction. The phenomenon
&gt;&gt; may very well be external entities trying to make contact, and if so,
&gt;&gt; that is just as cool. Either way, having thought the concept was
&gt;&gt; absurd at one time, I simply gave it a shot and the results were
&gt;&gt; undeniable. Honestly, subsequent attempts at ITC with the shack hack
&gt;&gt; have produced mixed results, none with the in-your-face accuracy of
&gt;&gt; the first time. Suffice it to say it is dissapointing I cannot have
&gt;&gt; that kind of success every time, but I can certainly say that there is
&gt;&gt; a force at work here and my curiosity is understandibly aroused.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; thanks

&gt;&gt;&gt; But, are there any files on this group where any of you believe you
&gt;&gt;&gt; are communicating with a spirit? Frank&#x27;s box seems to really force
&gt;&gt;&gt; all kinds of &quot;voices&quot; out of the airwaves and I am not yet buying it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Does any one have anything constructive to say to us in regard to
&gt;&gt;&gt; actual paranormal investigation via Frank&#x27;s box, rather than mildly
&gt;&gt;&gt; entertaining techno-tweaking?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I was on a multi-group investigation at an old historical mission in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Santa Barbara a week ago, for instance and watched the frank&#x27;s box at
&gt;&gt;&gt; work for the first time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, I heard a few things that sounded obviously like radio, but we
&gt;&gt;&gt; did hear a very eerie woman&#x27;s voice screaming when we were in the main
&gt;&gt;&gt; chapel room, and THAT got my attention.. But everything else I have
&gt;&gt;&gt; heard so far in the files here is not striking me as the voice of any
&gt;&gt;&gt; apparition, due to the weakness of quality.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you&#x27;re still reading this, I have to tell you I have had striking
&gt;&gt;&gt; results in my own home, simply letting a recording device roll, and if
&gt;&gt;&gt; you&#x27;re not yet interested in hearing these samples, I guess you&#x27;re
&gt;&gt;&gt; more into the box than the afterlife and that&#x27;s YOU, not me! :)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; LOVE,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Katherine.
