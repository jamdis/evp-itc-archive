If you use a recording program ...like Goldwave...you can actually slow them down while you listen to the playback, can ever listen to them backwards.  But I dont know of a way to slow down the sweep.  Are you using the AM or FM band? And have you tried switching to the other band(the one ur not using)?  Ive tried a session on the FM band but it doesnt really seem to work for some reason but the AM does good and Ive gotten a response that indicates that they agree with the AM being better here.

          Hi All, Have been doing sessions and sometimes get a voice or more that 
just jumps in and says a word or two durring the scan, but most of the 
time it seems it's like a room full of people talking very fast and 
thus I can't seem to hear them well enough to hear if they are giving 
me any messages! Am I the only one with this issue? How can I slow this 
down to hear better? =Judy= P.S. I only use the RS 12-469 with 
portable folding Craig speakers & a Sony cassette recorder with 
earphones (cups over ears). I sometimes use an external mic or just the 
cassette recorder's mic.
