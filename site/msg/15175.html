<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>After telling it to leave I haven&#x27;t noticed any problems. I ran an unusually long recording today (17 minutes) without a problem. Got a few EVP&#x27;s but not enough voice to understand anything. But I am sure all is well. Not having much luck during this heat :) I am uploading the file called &quot;recorder malfunction&quot; it is rather large 902kb so will erase real soon. BEWARE: at 10 second mark it gets very LOUD!! When he starts messing with it I guess. Then he has some noise spikes later in the recording that are not as loud. As for his VOICE....it is in the file called &quot;get out of my face&quot; in &quot;Jim&#x27;s RR-DR60 EVP&#x27;s&quot; at the files location. The voice was found in the 3rd recording attempt out in the country....it was at the begining around the 5 second mark. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, eamonn mgherbi &lt;eamonnmgherbi@...&gt; wrote:

&gt; &gt;I went out to record today out in country. Was about 3 miles out-have recorded here before (Vandelia). This time my recorder was acting up (DR60). The REC led indicator would flash sometimes (supposed to remain steady) and I would notice that the timer would stay in place for sometimes 5 seconds before it would change up one number....I though I had broken it somehow. I did hear lots of LOUD splatter noises on playback while in the field. My battery indicator showed 2 of 3 bars, but I went in to town and got fresh AAA&#x27;s anyway. I then went to water trough and the flashing still happened for 2 recordings here. I then said for the &quot;bad guy&quot; to leave and stop messing with my recorder. Well then on my 3rd attempt....recorder started working fine. After I finished the 3rd recording I packed up and went to the fairgrounds (just a spur of the moment) *I thought..... so at fairgrounds I recorded for a little over 10 minutes (I stopped at an old -church/school/
&gt;  courthouse- (single room log cabin-multiple uses back then) that was used in Debuke Iowa during 1823 (think was date). And I also asked questions around 2 other reconstructed buildings from long ago. Well I got home....when my recorder was acting up in country I find a Male evp say &quot;Get Out Of My Face&quot;. I think he was guy messing with my recorder.... ....Then while at the water trough (recorder still acting up even with 2 new batteries) I finally get it to work (after telling what I think followed me &quot;to leave&quot;). At the end of my last recording (the good one) from this water trough, I hear a little girl say &quot;come to the fair....someone said&quot; ***So I didn&#x27;t go to the fairgrounds uninvited*** I just decided to go for know reason I had guessed. Well what I am so &quot;disturbed&quot; about now......... is that while I was playing these other recordings I ACCIDENTALLY- ERASED my 10 plus minutes of recording from fairgrounds BEFORE I even got a chance to listen or
&gt;  download it. OOOoooowwww! !! :) Makes me mad. No telling what could have been on there. I was INVITED&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shucks! ! I will upload the &quot;get out of my face&quot; as the little girl is way to quite to hear. The guy is not so quite-but is still LOW audio. I don&#x27;t want him playing with my recorder anymore :/
