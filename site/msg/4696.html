<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This is my two cents regarding the box and the &quot;spread&quot; of it.

I would think the goal would be to get people experimenting with it 
as much as possible.  There are always going to be people who shoot 
it down, attack, etc., but you will find others who experiment with 
it, or embrace it, as well.  Nothing that is new (or old) will ever 
be exempt from the attack of others, unless of course one keeps it 
hidden in a closet.

With this type of ITC, it is ground-breaking IMHO, as the box is 
providing an avenue to &quot;open up the minds&quot; of those whose time has 
come to &quot;hear.&quot;  In other words, I suspect that only a given amount 
of people will be open to it; and that will be their time to explore 
the boxes and make contact with spirit.  That is the goal I would 
think: more belief by the populus and especially connection to the 
unseen, whatever that may be.

I just received a nasty e-mail from a TAPS lover attacking Angels &amp; 
Ghosts because I have written some articles with respect to their 
shoddy review of the Shadow Man pic at Moundsville (I am not dogging 
TAPS here).  I simply felt what was done by the TV show to the lady 
who took the image was wrong.  I also was attacked as to some of the 
EVPs on Angels &amp; Ghosts as being &quot;faked.&quot;  We receive submissions 
from all over the world and post those that are of interest (photos, 
videos, evp, stories, etc).  The only goal of the site is to post 
that which might cause others to consider the existence of spirit - 
the existence of more beyond the physical realm. Of course, we don&#x27;t 
try to post that which we know was faked.  Again pointing others to 
connect spiritually is the idea. 

Is that not what the boxes will be first used for?  I could see many 
people split on this, but the idea of turning more toward the 
spiritual (whatever your definition of that is), would be a basic 
goal.  From there, everyone must have their own personal experience 
to become a believer, no matter how good the evidence posted from 
anyone experimenting with ITC.

&gt;  well ihave to agree here with Bruce that blog was written from 
someone tthan&#x27;s never seen the box or any box in action first hand . 
This is someone who has no experience what so ever in any 
researches  . Has not spent the time nor the effort 
&gt; to ask the questions that need to be ask nor look for the 
answers .he a closed minded individual. who reached his conclusions a
&gt;  based on wha he see from the window  of is apt. never venturing 
out to explore  the possibility that the world has to offer. Anyone  
that has veneered in to a realm
&gt; of the questionable  has experienced things that defy   logic.
&gt; 
&gt;     If 10 yeas ago you said that the day was coming that i could 
take a pic with my phone and send that pic to someone halfway around 
the world in 10 sec  they would told me to have scotty to beam me up. 
but yet here we are.
&gt;   basically there our two type of people  based on that e out there 
dose that read and forum a opin. and those that step out there door 
and explore all possibility.
&gt; And many  great  explorers were  outcast in there lifetime only to 
be  reg ionized 
&gt; and ahead of there time later. 
&gt;   we need to go along and present what we find and let it stand on 
it&#x27;d own  .and ignore these small minded  arm chair  criteces  .
&gt; 
&gt;  just my thought on the subject

&gt;   
&gt;  This only becomes an issue when new people get interested in our 
research and seek information from the usual paranormal community and 
are met with these type of answers and explanations. They quickly 
become disinterested and whenever anyone may mention box research in 
the future they convey the same closed minded ignorance that was 
spewed to them on their initial quest for answers.
&gt;   
&gt;  Not to mention that anyone that does any serious research in this 
medium would I&#x27;m sure like to have their efforts recognised as being 
legitimate in their source and taken seriously with respect. not  
dismissed as nonsense or something that is written off as fake or 
delusional. 
&gt;   
&gt;  Frank I don&#x27;t want to start a long thread with all different 
people sniping back and forth I posted that snip it of a blog to let 
everyone know what the general consensus of our research is. And I 
did not even mention who the blog was actually about but I&#x27;m sure we 
all can guess. It&#x27;s that kind of stupidity that stops us from getting 
new potential researchers involved and adding their positive energy 
to our own, I have received messages from our friends on the other 
side that instruct that the more individuals that are involved and 
think positively about the communication we are striving to achieve, 
the stronger the communication will get. I view this blog attitude as 
not a personal attack on what I am particularly doing but just 
another extremely large hurtle to get over in bringing this amazing 
form of spirit communication to the forefront of paranormal research.

&gt;        Why would this be an issue? I am not doing this to convince 
others of the validity of my messages. If someone wants to learn how, 
I will teach them. If someone has questions I will answer them to the 
best of my ability. If someone is skeptical it is a distraction from 
my goals to try and convince them that something is real. Its 
pointless to try and convince or prove the reality of a practice that 
is so highly subjective and mostly personal.

&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] we have a hard row to hoe
&gt; 
&gt;   This statement was taken from a blog that was sent to me by 
steve. He 
&gt; came across it while web surfing.
&gt; 
&gt; It is indicitive of the attitude 90% of the paranormal community 
has 
&gt; toward box evp research.
&gt; 
&gt; I suggest we all memorise it because as box researchers this will 
be 
&gt; our most formitable object.
&gt; 
&gt; The first thought that comes to mind about this whole &#x27;box&#x27; thing 
is 
&gt; what are the chances that spirits would comunicate through such a 
box. 
&gt; I mean there are so many different radio frequencies the chances 
that 
&gt; anything would or would want to use the am or fm bands seems very 
&gt; unlikely.
