Sort of Jody. I am using a pc tv/fm card without the fm antenna hooked up. I watch tv on my pc sometimes and it has radio. There are friends there who loved using the computer so they are always talking about it and what I need to do with it. Some of the things I have tried and it worked, some I havent gotten around to yet. This was one they mentioned and I tried but the results werent astounding me until recently.
   
  I still bounce back to the old "water" method and use it along with the radio. I asked them if anyone could use this method and the results were varied. I guess it depends on who the person is. For instance I had one voice say clearly "it really works", then once I saved it and played it back it had changed to "it didnt work". But heres one answer that didnt change so perhaps you can hear this one. I'll also add the it really works one for you to see what you hear on your end. If you hear it really works maybe you can use this method easily.

      Frank This came after I emailed you so perhaps its a notation to add to what I said about thier words sometimes get edited or have more meaning later on. The message is improved in time. I am still not sure who used to be proud of me because I forgot to ask for names and later sessions were not as clear.
   
  The signals were very strong today here. I did a session using the pc fm radio set to the station "they" requested using no antenna hookup and then ran it thru the filter "they" made me stumble upon...the conversation was so loud in some parts it kinda freaked me out a little bit at first LOL 
   
  I dont usually use that method alot because it never has good results unless I mute it while recording even then it only increases thier signal a bit louder which I can do using amplify or turn the volume up.
   
  It's stormy here the past few days so perhaps that is a f actor.
