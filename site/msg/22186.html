<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>How I started this group back---don&#x27;t remember, sometime between 2004 and
2006, there has to be at least one or two that have stayed on, and were
here long before Hultay, long before Haliday, long before Chapple, long
before hacks. Not one stands up and says so. One I know of that knows all
this, the one I made owner of this group due to these incessant arguements
and even she does not say the truth.

 Yeah, meeza totally disgusted with humanity.
