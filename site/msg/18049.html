Thanks again for everyone who participate=
d! I  admire your courage and 
motivation to try different  methods, see wh=
at works, and try to improve 
everyone's  understanding of EVP-ITC.

If you=
 recall, on  7/10/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer  
monitor, =
right in front of me, and left it there until  today, 7/14/2010, noon 
Denv=
er time. The experiment was for  participants to determine what it was. 
Va=
gue or partial  answers wouldn't be counted (for example, just colors,  
sh=
apes, sizes, what it's made of, etc): we're looking for  what it is. 
Parti=
cipants could use their ghost boxes, EVP  recorders, or I suppose any other=
 
means they  chose.

In order to keep me honest, I took a picture  of the =
object at the start of 
the experiment and loaded it  to the Files section =
(RJ folder) of this 
group. If you can  follow the link, it is here:

_http=
://tech. groups.yahoo.  com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710.  
1.zip_ =
(http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip) 

T=
he idea was that you could download the  file at the beginning of the 
test=
, and 'keep it safe' on  your computer. Then at the end of the test, I woul=
d 
 release the password so you could reveal the contents of  the file. Tha=
t 
way, you were in control of the original  image during the entire test, =
not 
me. 

The password  for that file is: 123BlastOff
Instructions, if you=
 need  them, are also in that RJ folder.

And if you did  not care to downl=
oad the zip file before the test, I will  
post the final image there too.
=

So to the  results:

Number of participants: 5
Total tries:  8
Ambiguous a=
nswers: 0
Correct answers:  0

Object: A radio
Uzipped picture:
_http://tec=
h. groups.yahoo.  com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710.  
1.JPG_ (http:=
//tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG) 

So what=
 do the results mean? All that we  can really agree on from this 
experimen=
t is that no  participant, with whatever theories or methods or  
technolog=
y they used, was able to correctly determine the  object. We can't say 
tho=
se theories or methods or  technologies never work. Just as we can't say 
t=
hey do.  Just that, for whatever reason, they did not work this  time. 
Rea=
ders can take the results, use them to improve or  change their methods, or=
 
keep doing what they're  doing.

If anyone has any observations, comments=
, or  ideas for improvement, let me 
know. I hope to get a new  experiment =
up and running soon. Since there 
wasn't much  participation Mon-Wed, I thi=
nk the next experiment will be  
arranged to mostly span the weekends.

Aga=
in, thanks  to everyone who participated in this first  experiment.
