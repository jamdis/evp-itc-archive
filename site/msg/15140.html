There was a smaller Schematic Frank posted ab=
out using the tuner from a radioshack 469. It was a smaller diagram just sh=
owing where to plug your signal into the vt, and to provide the 3v into the=
 tuner. Sorry im not more specific, im a newbie to circuits.

Frank emailed=
 me back and said for a random sweep he no longer likes using the white noi=
se generator, and instead prefers to use a dual supply op amp. Im not entir=
ely sure what a op amp is or how to use it. Im assuming it produces a rando=
m signal that can be used for the VT. BUt I need to do alot more research t=
o learn what it really does.
