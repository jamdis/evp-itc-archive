I would call that pretty good evidence right there.

  Interesting topic!

  BTW that invest=
igation was at the former Manteno State Mental Hospital. It included the am=
azing "It's Harold Wing" EVP I got. None of the people doing the investigat=
ion there had ever heard of Harold Wing. Upon later examination of old reco=
rds, it was found that Harold Wing was actually a patient who died there of=
 typhoid fever in 1938. But we didn't find that out until weeks later.

  H=
ow do you explain that conventionally?
  :-)

      There's another possibility: possibly the spirits involved only wis=

 Other people on the investigation didn't get them at all. Go figure!

         I believe I saw an explaination on this list about why if you have=
