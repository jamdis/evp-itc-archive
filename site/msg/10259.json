The strength of your connection and the \nclarity\n&gt; of your messages depends on the strength of the bond or bridge you\n&gt; develop with your friends on the otherside. The equipment is only\n&gt; needed to materialize the message. This is why you can use almost\n&gt; anything as a medium to bring them across.\n&gt; \n&gt; I love to see people learn on their own through their own \nreasoning.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank R.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think your correct Kay!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; psfponies &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:          Bruce \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hate to say it but out of all the responses I have heard Mike \n&gt; &gt; Edwards seem to get the best reponses to his questions on his \n&gt; &gt; clickity 12-469 shack hack box.

But full fledged researchers. \nOf \n&gt; &gt; &gt; course they have much to learn, but so do we all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Which brings me to my suggestion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Steve and I have recently been discussing the point we have \n&gt; &gt; reached \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the research, both in process and knowledge. We agreed on \nmost \n&gt; &gt; &gt; points,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the most important one being. It is time to move beyond the \nsame \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mundane session content and the same rudimentary line of \n&gt; &gt; questioning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This research is stagnating for lack of direction, any posted \n&gt; &gt; files \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or discussions revolve around the same stale subjects such as, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Is there anyone there that wishes to communicate&quot;, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;What is your name&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;who am I speaking with&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;what is it like where you are&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe we have all received every combination of answer to \n&gt; &gt; those \n&gt; &gt; &gt; questions that we possibly can, yet we continue to ask them \n&gt; &gt; session \n&gt; &gt; &gt; after session. And still become amazed at a yes or no answer \nor \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; simplest of phrases.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not saying this about any single level of researcher but \nall \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; us myself included have fallen into this rut. We are not \nlearning \n&gt; &gt; &gt; anything, All our efforts are amounting to nothing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We already know that we are communicating with someone or \n&gt; &gt; something. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe we have all come to believe that through our \npersonal \n&gt; &gt; &gt; research and the evidence presented by all of us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Within the last year the technology and potential of this type \nof \n&gt; &gt; &gt; research has exceeded all expectations in it&#39;s quality and \nspeed \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; development. We are actually letting it go to waste.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I and a few other researchers believe that whoever is on the \nother \n&gt; &gt; &gt; side of the line has had a hand in some of us developing this \nnew \n&gt; &gt; &gt; equipment and methods of research be it obvious or subtle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But our methods of research have not excelled, we are \nconducting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; research in the same manner as we did when there where only \nabout \n&gt; &gt; 5 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of us in the whole world actively doing this research.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; New individuals are joining our ranks and becoming interested \nin \n&gt; &gt; box \n&gt; &gt; &gt; research every day. The protocol they are being instructed to \nuse \n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; antiquated and obsolete.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is fine to teach them these methods as a basic foundation \nof \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; research and to get their feet wet. But like any other \neducation \n&gt; &gt; &gt; process it must evolve and develop with the accumulation of \n&gt; &gt; knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If we approached academic education the way we approach box \n&gt; &gt; research, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; we would all still be in the first grade.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I propose a committee to develop a method of research and \nprotocol \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that can deal with the ever evolving technology and decide \nwhat \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; how we should approach the type of communication we seek and \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; subject matter that should be addressed, that will be \ncontinually \n&gt; &gt; &gt; changing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Only in this way will the wheels of research and learning move \n&gt; &gt; &gt; forward and we will gain the knowledge we seek and hopefully \nbe \n&gt; &gt; able \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to share it with the world someday.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But if we continue to ask &quot;Is anyone there willing to speak \nwith \n&gt; &gt; me&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We are doomed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone that wishes to discuss this and give opinions or \nsuggestions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; please lets try and get started every minute we waste is a \nmissed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; opportunity for learning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                            \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo! \nMobile. \n&gt; Try it now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
