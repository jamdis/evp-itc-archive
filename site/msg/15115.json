I have my New (to me) Sony TCM-5000 strapped to my bike seat (not turned on). I am asking if they can &quot;maybe do something with the circuits.... or CHARGE it up&quot; As I listen I hear (low audio) wump-wump-wump (loud ringing sound) then (low audio) wuuump-wuuump. Maybe they DID or WILL do something :) \n&gt; \n&gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/EVP- ITC/files/ Jim%27s%20RR- DR60%20EVP% 27s/charge% 20up%20my% 20Sony.mp3 \n&gt; \n&gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; http://help. yahoo.com/ l/us/yahoo/ groups/original/ members/web/ index.htmlfiles\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; clockdryve &lt;clockdryve@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt;"}
