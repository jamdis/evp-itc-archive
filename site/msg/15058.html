&gt; There are alot of rumors circulating around. Another source claims to have pictures of him with his arms tied above his head. If this is the case, there had to havebeen someone else present at the time.
&gt; 
&gt; I admit, I didn&#x27;t even see you post any article so somehow I missed it.

&gt; Ron, I already sent through the article which said, his hands &quot;were tied behind his back&quot; everyone was too busy looking at the blood he had been hanging a long time, all the blood was in his legs, and his upper torso was white, is what one article said, some camera guy was there on the seen his name was Russell, and he claimed to have seen this type of thing before, I thought Steve or someone would put 2 and 2 together. Guess not, I guess no one bothered to read what I sent out there. sf

&gt; His hands weren&#x27;t tied. All the articles I have seen only state his neck was tied to his genitals. All I can say is good luck to him now!

&gt; It wasn&#x27;t suicide, it was accidental:
&gt; 
&gt; Carradine Death Was Accidental
&gt; 
&gt; IMDb, June 4, 2009
&gt; 
&gt; David Carradine died during a sex game that went wrong, according to sources in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was found dead on Thursday.
&gt; 
&gt; Carradine&#x27;s body was discovered in a hotel suite and local reports suggested he committed suicide. 
&gt; 
&gt; He was discovered by a maid, naked and hanged, but the suggestions his death had a sexual twist were strongly disputed by the star&#x27;s close friend, attorney Vicki Roberts, and his manager Chuck Binder, who insisted he died of natural causes. 
&gt; 
&gt; But a statement from Carradine&#x27;s representative now indicates the actor died during a sex act.
&gt; 
&gt; The spokesperson tells TMZ.com, &quot;We can confirm 100 percent that he never would have committed suicide. It was an accidental death. Everybody is in shock.&quot; 
&gt; 
&gt; Rumours Carradine died attempting auto-erotic asphyxiation- -where victims achieve heightened sexual pleasure by restricting their air supply are backed up by a quote a Bangkok police officer gave to British newspaper The Sun. 
&gt; 
&gt; The cop tells reporters, &quot;A rope was attached to his neck and also to his penis&quot;. 
&gt; 
&gt; Rocker Michael Hutchence was rumoured to have died attempting the same sex act in a Sydney, Australia, hotel room back in 1997--although his death was officially declared a suicide.
&gt; 
&gt; Carradine was in Thailand to shoot the movie &quot;Stretch.&quot; He was 72.

&gt; The spirit world to talk with David Carradine, to see what happened, if someone may have killed him, it&#x27;s hard to believe that he would take his own life, I feel like it was foul play. sf
