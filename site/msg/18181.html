The=C2=A0 first link allowed you to download a secure pdf with the picture =
before the test.
It was secure on your computer, if you read the instructio=
ns.=C2=A0 In fact, you could even save it to a CD or something if you wante=
d, for 
further security.=C2=A0 It could be opened, on your computer, at th=
e end of the test once you had the password.=C2=A0 I don't know about you, =
but my CDRW doesn't come with a mentalism option.

After the test, I simply=
 released the password, which anyone who used it could decrypt the file the=
y saved.=C2=A0 The second link I uploaded after the test, so that those who=
 did not download the file could see the picture anyway if they wished.

Th=
at is not mentalism: its encryption.=C2=A0 And pretty secure at that.
If yo=
u'd like me teach you more about that, let me know.=C2=A0=C2=A0

treat them like some retarded idiots over there, i wish to give them respec=

they didn't get your test right doesn't mean that it's any less fascinating=
 to me that something talks that shouldn't.  They probably could care less =
what's on your monitor.  <br>
