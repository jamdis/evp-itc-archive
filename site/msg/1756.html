<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>hey guy&#x27;s
I did another fm sweep this morning and was going over it and got this 
really long message. pertaining to a spirit that I captured an evp from 
on a cemetery investigation in Staten island NY, it mentions the spirit 
by name and it&#x27;s funny because it was the voice of a little girl and I 
said a prayer for her spirit guide to find her and help her cross over. 
This was about a month and a half ago. and today I get this message on 
the FM sweep recording. I have posted only the two messages in the file 
section under bhali sweep and sound file folder. they are the only two 
files in there I deleted the rest so as not to use up to much space.
The first is it&#x27;s me Mandy and the second is named long file and I 
believe it says &quot;awaiting something_ a man named Saul _he&#x27;ll be asking 
for Mandy_ he&#x27;s from our side_ he&#x27;s a rabbi&quot;

please let me know what you think. There are quite a few more and I&#x27;m 
only part way through the recording.
