LOL usually anyone who says "i'm the best" or "i'm the expert" or "i'm supe=
rior" is the last person I pay attention to because thats ego speaking. Eve=
ryone has the capability to form good communication with other spirits whet=
her in life or passed on, it's the intent that matters. So go in with good =
intent and you wont be disappointed. Be=A0respectful and honest and you ten=
d to get it in return, be nasty and negative and ditto on the response ya g=
et. 
=A0
Nobody is an expert here, whether ya been at this 2 years or 100, =
everyone is learning as they go and hopefully sharing what we learn along t=
he way. Like I said life is about learning.
