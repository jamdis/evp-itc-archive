I was thinking it could be used (as there are several RNG projects floating around out there based of varying modes of this platform) as a random source for tuning and speakjet inputs.\n\nI suppose you could also use it to interface sensor triggering. Seems like a cool idea, I think I will order one next payday.\n\nthanks\nAndy"}
