Been facinated with EVPs on C2C for \nyears and a few days ago realized that I have a room full of high end \naudio and video recording equipment, 4 computers and software to do \nanything with anything...Hey!  I can set something up to do EVPs!  \nI&#39;ve got a starter set on my desktop that worked on the first try \nand &quot;Rick&quot; (my contact)has been helpful in getting it fine tuned. \nDesktop setup uses EVPmaker chewing up a 1 minute segment of a man \ngiving a talk, with white noise (EVP said &quot;use that noise&quot;)in a loop \non Soundbooth.  I use a AKG 414 mike about 18&quot; from the computer \nspeakers and simply lean over it to ask questions, and record on to \nAudition. \n   My next move is to create a laptop based system using as few \ncomponents as possible. I&#39;m looking at the RadioShark 2 USB am/fm \nradio, and hoping to leave it &quot;stock&quot; and have it scan using \nsoftware.  I&#39;ve found some 3rd party software that might work, but \ndon&#39;t know the particulars of the &quot;scan&quot; function.  Anybody here gone \nthis route or know of software that will work?  My portable sytem \nwould be the laptop, Radio Shark 2, and a microphone-and maybe a \nLogitec external speaker.  Play white noise and radio scan thru \nspeakers, record back on computer.  Whaddya think?\n   Started my listening career in teh 1960&#39;s building Knight kit \nshortwave radios, and still enjoy Shortwave listening - utilites \nmostly.  EVP seems like the next level.\nThanks\nBill"}
