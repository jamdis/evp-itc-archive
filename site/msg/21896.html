<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Here&#x27;s a recording I made with EVP Maker using a sound file that was
originally created for learning a foreign language. I don&#x27;t know what
language it is. You can hear my dog in the background panting and shaking.
He has tags on his collar that rattle when he shakes. You can also hear
birds outside where I had my window open, but that&#x27;s not until near the end.

Here&#x27;s what I think I can hear so far. Comments are welcome!

:02 Yeah, Bob&#x27;s in here (my father-in-law and brother-in-law, both deceased,
are named Bob)
:11 It&#x27;s on the topic
:25 Ghost box (this is a spoken EVP, not in the original recording)
:42 It&#x27;s a secret from ... (i don&#x27;t understand the rest)
1:07 It predicted in...(don&#x27;t understand)
1:25 Throw out this box! (this is a spoken EVP, not in the original
recording.)

I&#x27;ll be doing more of these to see what I can get. I have another one I
haven&#x27;t analyzed yet, but I&#x27;ll post it soon.
