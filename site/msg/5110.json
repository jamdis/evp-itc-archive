Nada, nothing, zilch.  Maybe because I only get to scan past 5 to 8 channels on Am or FM so I don&#39;t have enough signals to muster a response.  But from what you and others with experience seem to be saying, it shouldn&#39;t matter because I will get help from someone on the other-side.  Maybe they can&#39;t find me in Mexico?  Please let your techs know I am here...should be no problem with immigration papers or money exchange.  I really need help.
