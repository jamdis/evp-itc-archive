What about the video box I made years before my anal\ncritic and his cronies even heard of EVP. I used the random sweep mode to\nsweep a tuner removed from an old VCR, it no longer function because the\nTV broadcast format has been changed, I have no idea how to program a new\ncable tuner to sweep. Maybe the genious out there can do it, but probly\nnot, everyone knows the entities are just mindless zombies that can not\npossibly manipulate video. Note the date, 2007, long before my more anal\ncritics became aware of the boxes. Before Chaple&#39;s hack &quot;discovery&quot;.\n\n Three faces in one, just some trick of the eye, can&#39;t be spirit.\n\nF-S\n\nNo imp o emen eh?
