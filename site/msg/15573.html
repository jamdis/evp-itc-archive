&gt; Something funny, I was taking a break for doing house work that rarely
gets
&gt; down, but my new bosses on the Radio (box) aka the brownie gallery or
the
&gt; peanut club, say, &quot;clean up, clean up&quot; and when I came into my room,
&gt; leaving them to chat amoung themselves, i heard some fella say, &quot;now
what&#x27;s she
&gt; up to?&quot; It&#x27;s like having a lot of guests without having to feed them,
lol
&gt; love them all dearly, i so happy i found out about all of you, last i
heard
&gt; of this was long ago, that was a mr meek, i never thought this would
&gt; happen in my day, this world doesn&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s missing. Have a
Happy day
