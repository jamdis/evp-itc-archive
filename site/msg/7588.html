                 No money need honey.  Here is the link   http://skype.com/  Once you download it just add me.  It doesn't cost, only if you want to use it for your primary phone service.  As long as we have skype as well, its free.  It's kind of like cingular wireless, person to person!
   
                  We would love to have everyone.  I am sure there are so many things we can teach and discover together.  Looking foreward to adding you!

I can not get the service here to make out bound calls because there is a block on the web site when I try to sign up.  If there is a charge at your end I can first send you a check for say two hours and then run a tab with you.  If it is not to complicated beyond that.  What say you?  Ron

Frank had spent many hours building this devices, and believe this was never his intention for people to keep their experience and audio to themselves or to profit in anyway.
   
  Therefore, anyone wanting to sit in on a session is more than welcome.  Some of us here get together via Skype free internet phone, allowing an opportunity for anyone to take part and share the experience.  Just because you don't have  FB doesn't mean you can't experience and take part in great communication.  Prior to me owning one, I sat in with Steve and Bruce, allowing me an opportunity to listen to their FB's (which they both have differently unique boxes) and do my own recordings.  To them I was very greatful, and I never felt left off.  
   
  Many of us have various boxes and conduct sessions differently, this allows us additional ways to learn from each other and experience all the boxes.  
   
  If anyone is interested, please just let me know, some of you hear already can confirm these get togethers and you walk away with a greater respect for each other and spirit communication.
