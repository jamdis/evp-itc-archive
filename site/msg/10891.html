This is pretty much directed to everyone.
   
  Hmm lets see I worked 2pm-11 last night then turn around and got up at 4 am to work 6-3 today so if we do the math we will see Misty just spent 18 of the last 24 hours on my feet and running around having to be in charge LOL. So please dont think I am going to spend my few hours freetime playing babysitter here.
   
  Quite frankly all involved have been told I do not have time for thier online dramafests. They can go fight each other all they wish to somewhere else its stupid. I am not thier mother and tho it is Mother's day I do not feel any motherly tendancies towards anyone and that includes my friends. 
   
  As for research, while everyone is so wrapped up in the feeding frenzy against one another elsewhere, I still use my freetime to do research or spend time with those I actually get along with. I would suggest they give it a try. If they enjoy fighting...good for them more power to them and have fun...someplace else. 
   
  People here seem to think I am the boss. I tell you all now YOU are the boss of YOURSELF. You speak for yourself, your own actions and everything you say and do will be a representation of who you really are. Have a good look in the mirror to make sure that image doesnt resemble some of the things you hate about others. Positive, negative, good, evil, its up to you just like it is up to all spirits to choose how they treat others.
   
  I cant choose for you. But I will say I am here to learn more about ITC and do research. What are you guys here for? If its not one of those things then you simply joined the wrong group. Keep going you will find the right one they pretty much have one for everything these days.
   
  As for the BS we have been subjected to enough of it so people who post junk against each other simply will get it deleted and posting privledges moderated or removed. Find something better to do or someplace better to do it. 
   
  I do not control you all. Nor do I wish to. And I do not have to take a side in a fight I dont believe in.
   
  So my side is, at the end of the day I am tired. The fighting is dumb. And I am done wasting another minute discussing it. Those who post here should be posting about ITC or do not bother to post. If you feel that you have to fight with each other, fine go fight...I just dont want to be forced to read it nor do the members of this group who are here for the RIGHT reasons.
   
  On that note I hope that you all have a great day. For all the moms out there HAPPY MOTHERS DAY! I certainly hope it was a good one =)
   
  Misty
