<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The problem here is that these are NOT EVP. That&#x27;s why we call it ITC. If
you&#x27;re used to listening to and for EVP, you are going to hear something
completely different.

Took me a while to get used to at first but I did.

&gt; here was some replys from my team member who considers himself our
&gt; de-bunker:
&gt;
&gt; The one pertaining to &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t kill&quot; here was his reply:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;doesnt sound like &quot;he wouldn&#x27;t kill&quot; sounds like &quot; he wont show ?(her) it
&gt; was cut off.
&gt; anyway why would we call this an evp?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; This was his response to the one where we asked what happened when they
&gt; tried to escape and got the response &quot;da pit&quot;
&gt;
&gt; He says:&quot;this one sound like a sports radio frequency &quot;the Pitt&quot; sburgh
&gt; Penquins. I hear do &quot;back off&quot;.
&gt; example of just radio chatter scanning, to me. would you submit as
&gt; evidence?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; The one where we asked about how to get thru the steel bars and wood and we
&gt; get the &quot;Take ur file&quot; as a response, my team member who isn&#x27;t buying any of
&gt; this replys:
&gt; &quot;I slowed end down sounds like &quot;take your final&quot; or &quot;findings could be
&gt; talking college radio, who knows, its radio frequencies&quot;
&gt;
&gt; by the way after i slowed the same file down i noticed it comes thru
&gt; between 6-8 different clicks on 12-469 radio on the am channel. AS we all
&gt; know that would equal about 6-8 different channels. what is the chances of
&gt; getting an understandable phrase in the same tone of voice across that many
&gt; channels... i should pose that response back to him and see what his
&gt; de-bunking result would be?
&gt;
&gt; I guess he&#x27;s intitled to his own opinion, i am just gonna ignore his
&gt; responses and keep doing what i am doing. Thanks for the support and
&gt; knowledge!
&gt;
&gt; Keep the comments coming
