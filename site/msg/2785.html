I was too tired to post but I listened to those files last night. I heard the first eq file same as you except one word...monday i heard as tuesday. When you got into slowing it down etc that brought up different multilayers within so I heard some other stuff.

  I know how hard it is for you sometimes with what the guys send ya. Thats why ya just have to take it as a grain of salt and use it as a learning experience rather than some profound truth being said all the time.
   
  I dont let any of it discourage me, it all interests me instead. I dont get as much deception, but its happened in the past and usually the others are quick to point out the deciever and remove them.

 and how it's being perceived, you can't prevent yourself from being deceived, or more like played with. I know I'll be deceived, and tricked, and I tell them have fun with that, cuz I don't really care. I'm not after any particular spirit, or piece of knowledge.  
 
 When these voices tell someone not to share the information, that's even thinner ice to on!

I find the communication mode itself facsinating, and don't expect that profound paranormal knowledge others seem to seek. I don't care who is talking through the box.  I think those seeking those bits of profound knowledge, or secrets will get lead right down the rabbit hole.
