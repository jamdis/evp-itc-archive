I mean how many times do I need to\n&gt; hear a crackly voice &quot;get out&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt;  There is PurplesGroup on yahoo. Yeah, my group, I own it and if people\n&gt; start that skeptic non-sense they get the boot!\n&gt; \n&gt;  I have my questions, such as hauntings, I don&#39;t believe in stuck spirits,\n&gt; but I still watch Ghost Hunters from time to time and consider their\n&gt; &quot;evidence&quot;. From my point of view and experience, EVP is technology, and\n&gt; technology is cut and try, see what works. How many think Edison\n&gt; scientifically analyzed every filament he tried for the light bulb?  If he\n&gt; did it according the these modern skeptics we&#39;d still be waiting for light\n&gt; bulbs as they told him how impossible it was. That is not an exaggeration,\n&gt; there&#39;s thousands getting meaningful personal messages via the box and other\n&gt; methods, often addressing them by name, that others can hear, yet these\n&gt; skeptics would have us all believe we are completely delusional. Science is\n&gt; dusty old men sitting around a fireplace in leather chairs telling each\n&gt; other how smart they are. Thing is, they create all their precious evidence\n&gt; as well. First they theorize, then they discover.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
