What kind of box did you\n&gt; &gt; use? In the AM one there&#39;s a guy talking almost all the way through. At\n&gt; &gt; :59 I hear &quot;It does (or is it doesn&#39;t?) work. This is difficult.&quot; At\n&gt; &gt; 1:06 I hear him say something about a verdict or some similar word and\n&gt; &gt; then says &quot;This will help him.&quot; It sounds like their talking about a lot\n&gt; &gt; of technical stuff.\n&gt; &gt; Jamie\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, urkel23@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t had any feedback on a box since box #52, but i still post\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test audio anyway.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Steve Hultay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _www.keyportparanormal.com_ (http://www.keyportparanormal.com/)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/_\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _www.stevehultay.com_ (http://www.stevehultay.com/)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _www.rtscresearch.org_ (http://www.rtscresearch.org/)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
