<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t see how posting a prediction only you can confirm has any bearing on demonstrating anything other than that you believe.  It means nothing else.

If you have a post with a prediction we can all confirm, I&#x27;d love to hear it.  

Before it is supposed to happen, with a date it is supposed to happen, and exactly what is to happen, of course.

We&#x27;ve already got lots of end-of-the-world stuff from Frank on 2012.  So we can skip those.  We can measure that validity of that in 2012.

&gt; RJ, I have plenty of files with things from past events, I posted them  
&gt; before it came true, that was back last year, are you new on the list?  My

&gt; did,  maybe it&#x27;s subjective, if you have a problem with this type of research,

&gt; Why do you call what I say mean?  Is it because I  hold a different opinion 
&gt; to yours?  Just because I am honest about  my observations of a technology 
&gt; does not make me &#x27;mean&#x27;, does  it?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, even though you said you got &quot;lots of prediction type files&quot;, it 
&gt; doesn&#x27;t apply as  any kind of proof when it is talked about after the fact.  The 
&gt;  predictions must be clear to everyone before they happen, and not  subject 
&gt; to misinterpretation, generalization, or vague dating.   (Like 
&gt; _nostradamus_ 
&gt; (https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KmA3TJyVFYublgeu2LyjBg&amp;ved=0CBYQBSgA&amp;q=nostradamus&amp;spell=1)   usually is).
&gt; 
&gt; I also must point out, when I give an observation on  a technique or 
&gt; device, it is not my observation that you all argue  against: rather, you attack 
&gt; me personally (accusing me of not posting  enough EVPs, or of being mean).  
&gt; That&#x27;s the mean part, not  me.

&gt; Why are you being so mean  to people RJ?  We&#x27;ve all gotten lots of 
&gt; prediction type files,  that have come true, last year some spirit even found my 
&gt; lost  bird, and she was right where they said she&#x27;d be. sf

&gt; &quot;   So RJ--where&#x27;s your EVPs?  How can a skeptic type judge others research

&gt; MacDonald&#x27;s, yet critiques major restaurants. &quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I  wouldn&#x27;t waste anyone&#x27;s time  by posting a bunch of radio  snippets that 
&gt; &quot;Sound like something&quot;.  I would post one  if it ever actually seemed proof 
&gt; of intelligent communication  to me: for example, a bunch of consistent 
&gt; predictions, posted  before the event, read by all, then confirmed  afterwards. 
&gt;  That would be the only worthwhile thing to  post that I can think of.
&gt; 
&gt; Since I have never gotten  anything like that, I have not posted it.
&gt; 
&gt; And I notice  neither have you.

&gt; &quot;I think your instinct to stop posting this stuff might  have been a good 
&gt; one. I suspect you are feeling a bit  overwhelmed with this field right now, 
&gt; and it may be  something is nagging at you inside someplace, saying it is a  
&gt; waste of your time or a burden on your life and health, or  that you just 
&gt; need a little more space for a while.&quot;
&gt;  
&gt;  It&#x27;s a knowing we all have, that there&#x27;s  something to this, that it&#x27;s 
&gt; amazing, yet remains unprovable  to others.

&gt; 
&gt; Actually, it&#x27;s more  interesting than that.  Not only do you not  control 
&gt; what the &#x27;spirits&#x27; say, you also don&#x27;t  control what broadcast radio says, 
&gt; and to a large  extent you don&#x27;t control what your brain finds and  interprets 
&gt; in the noise you are hearing.
&gt; 
&gt; I  listened to these (trying not to look at the labels,  since once a 
&gt; person looks at the labels, they prime  their brains to interpret the sounds in 
&gt; YOUR way,  not their own way).  To me, they were either  just a mess of 
&gt; random radio snippets, exactly what  you&#x27;d expect if a 3 year old were randomly 
&gt; twisting  the radio dial, or they were just noise.   Nothing paranormal in 
&gt; the least.

&gt; 
&gt; In any case, I&#x27;d recommend  a break: take a nice month off.  See how you  
&gt; feel being away from all this for a while.   Come back fresh if you feel ok 
&gt; after that.  But  if you feel obsessed when away, it might be good to  ask 
&gt; your friends and loved ones for some opinions on  what they see in you.  Your 
&gt; health is more  important than anything here anyways, and you can&#x27;t  really 
&gt; do a job with interpretation of your results,  much less your other 
&gt; responsibilities in life,  unless you put your health first.

&gt;  
&gt; Well, got no  response out of the other list, let&#x27;s see if any  of you 
&gt; folks on these lists can hear these at all.  They may be too fast, but I did try 
&gt; to  slow them a bit,  I know, these are very  hard to hear, got them last 
&gt; night in response to  Steve&#x27;s letter about all the  &quot;religious&quot;  crap I&#x27;ve 
&gt; been sending,   such weird files I sometimes send in lately.  I do not control 
&gt; what spirits say though,  after all they are just people too.  Got one  on 
&gt; here that&#x27;s really funny, I think it has a  little demon on it too, he seems 
&gt; very angry, and  wants someone to &quot;Let me out!  Let me out!&quot;  is what he is 
&gt; saying, I think he is wanting to  come after some folks, because, even 
&gt; demon&#x27;s  believe in God.  He really sounds mad at some  people and wants 
&gt; &quot;.....out,&quot; just going to let you  hear it, may need to play it several times to  
&gt; hear, but I think its kinda cute. I told them  what some on the lists were 
&gt; saying,  and this was the response.  btw  Is  someone going to Florida ?  The 
&gt; last one says  something about FL Hope you all enjoy them.  sf
