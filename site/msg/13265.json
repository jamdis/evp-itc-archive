I have a couple files \nthat I feel are pretty clear. So if you would like to volunteer just \nsend me an email with your email adress and I will send you a file not \ntoo long but it will be unedited and in its original form.\nI will not amplify it or edit or change it in anyway from its original. \nThose who recive the files do the same NO editing untill you render \nyour opinion to me about it after that you can do what u like with it.\n Remember after listening email me DO NOT post what you hear on the \nboard I will do that later when I have everyones opinion.\n                                Mike W\n                         nightparanormalresearch@..."}
