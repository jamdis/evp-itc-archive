&gt; Hi Margaret, ask Arthur if by &#x27;air&#x27; he is refering to aether/ether. This is the energy that 
could be surrounding all matter.
&gt; Great session BTW :-)

&gt; Hi Stefan.  I don&#x27;t think &#x27;air&#x27; means soundwaves in this case.  And I&#x27;m in agreement with 
&gt; you, that I don&#x27;t think sound is the key in the technique (though I suspect it to be with 
the 
&gt; Portuguese crowd babble background and Voice 2000s DA300 recorder combo.)
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m going to try to get more specific answers about what exactly &#x27;air&#x27; is from Arthur&#x27;s 
&gt; perspective.

&gt; &gt; Hi Margaret,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; could &#x27;air&#x27; perhaps mean &#x27;sound waves&#x27;? Although I personally don&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; think that sound is the key.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Bruce.  I hear most the content in your clips as you are.  On this one, I believe it 
&gt; says, &quot;I
&gt; &gt; &gt; will get us AIR speech.&quot;  I have repeatedly been told with this method that &#x27;air&#x27; has 
&gt; &gt; &gt; something to do with the communication.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure what Arthur&#x27;s definition of &#x27;air&#x27; is, but it is definitely key to what is taking 
&gt; place.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; He&#x27;s used terms and phrases like &quot;Air-to-air&quot; - &quot;Air Ports&quot; - &quot;Air Portals&quot; - &quot;Helps 
you 
&gt; &gt; &gt; enter our air&quot; - &quot;They&#x27;ll give you air to us&quot; - &quot;I have air&quot; etc.  MANY references.
&gt; &gt;
