It would be insane, more than that, asinine to say that\n&gt; Science has never helped mankind or is a worthless endeavor.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Wasted\n&gt; space even having to write the words out.  It is unquestionable, on the\n&gt; whole.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have seen several bright minds ask for more information.  Studies that\n&gt; are quoted from and &quot;EVP Experts&quot;  Yet I am seeing that information slow to\n&gt; come forth.\n&gt;\n&gt; You are very correct.  Science has been wrong many times before.  But, it\n&gt; is always self correcting.  Not because of ego, but because of the very\n&gt; reason you are mad at it.  It is an unrelenting, cold-hearted swamp bitch!\n&gt; LOL   Science is not a thing that cares about what you want or think you\n&gt; hear.  It cares about verifiable, commendable and repeatable evidence.\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem you are having, well other than not getting the Thorizie shots\n&gt; on time LOL  Might be, the about lack of logic in the theory to begin with.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What you are doing is going from point (A) to point (C)  And never taking a\n&gt; real hard look at point (B)  Now, you are an electrician guy.  You of all\n&gt; people understand the idea of circuits and connections and flow.  The same\n&gt; thing works in Logic and Science.\n&gt;\n&gt; POINT (A)  I am taking a constantly scaning radio and getting voices.\n&gt;\n&gt; POINT (C)  They are talking to me and making sense.  They are telling me\n&gt; all kinds of information that no one could ever know, at least as I perceive\n&gt; it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now here is the real kicker!\n&gt;\n&gt; POINT (B)  Yeah this is the hard one.  How do you know they are taking to\n&gt; you?  You do understand the nature of the human mind and how it works?  Do\n&gt; you understand that this information is nothing new and it dates back to the\n&gt; year 1956? (I am thinking)\n&gt;\n&gt; How do you get past point (B)?  Do you except it on faith?  That is a\n&gt; Religion.  Can we study it as a Science?\n&gt;\n&gt; And if we come to our own conclusions about things are we not all heretics\n&gt; in the school of &quot;Frank&quot;  Maybe the word &quot;Church&quot; would be better LOL\n&gt;\n&gt; Get me past point (B) and I will lead the charge against the ignorant\n&gt; Scientific / Skeptic assholes out to get FRANK.\n&gt;\n&gt; Till then, there are problems with logic.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Nature is showing us only the tail of the lion, but I have no doubt that\n&gt; the lion belongs to it even though, because of its large size, it cannot\n&gt; totally reveal itself all at once.&quot;\n&gt; -— Albert Einstein\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in\n&gt; delusions, however satisfying and reassuring.&quot;\n&gt; --Carl Sagan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;There is no such thing as an insignificant detail.

As usual, igonore all facts and all other methods, such as\n&gt;&gt; EVPmaker, which forms all the voices inside the computer. Ignore all phone\n&gt;&gt; EVP messages, ignore all voices heard with no electronic aids. Ignore\n&gt;&gt; messages received via turned off TV and printers--and on and on, yet they\n&gt;&gt; know all about EVP..Ignore the fact that probably thousands use boxes\n&gt;&gt; successfully.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;We have conducted a few listening studies of reported radio-sweep EVP and\n&gt;&gt; the results have not been good. We have also worked with a variety of such\n&gt;&gt; devices. Based on what we know about trans-etheric influences, how EVP and\n&gt;&gt; visual forms of ITC are formed and what we know about mediumship, it is\n&gt;&gt; difficult to fit radio-sweep into any established hypothesis. Without solid\n&gt;&gt; research supporting it as producing EVP, it is impossible for us to\n&gt;&gt; recommend it or support its use. If there were double-blind studies\n&gt;&gt; conducted by experienced researchers that shows it does produce phenomena,\n&gt;&gt; we would gladly promote it as an alternative technique.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We are pretty sure that, in transform EVP (ordinary recorder), the voice\n&gt;&gt; is formed in the electronics by transforming available audio-frequency noise\n&gt;&gt; in an active part of the electronics such as a transistor junction. We think\n&gt;&gt; the process is amplification of a weak telekinetic signal via stochastic\n&gt;&gt; resonance and we have found that the optimum audio-frequency signal for this\n&gt;&gt; is a chaotic one rich in voice-frequencies with many transient perturbation.\n&gt;&gt; That is our working hypothesis. &quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  I can&#39;t say who this is from, cuz almost certain I&#39;d get sued. There&#39;s no\n&gt;&gt; double blind testing their BS either.
