when i coined the term superresonance i didnt know about superresonant black holes.  its not related to that.  the main thing is, its repeatable
   
  theres no doubt about mechanism.  its squeezing a mixture of quantum noise, thermal noise and signal so it stays "squoze" and emerges into the real world where it doesnt really belong.  alternatively, it is mathematically the equivilant of welding scalars into vectors -although that is not a good description of actual process; alternative 2: precision virtual state engineering.
   
  as transistors get smaller and faster, pure quantum oddities and breakovers are going to be a big problem.  state of the art is almost there right now;  if you can suck the quantum zoo-animals into the real world, you can also force them out of your quantum well computer. you can be a real bully :)
   
  the significance is that it is no longer haphazard, relying on luck and a stiff tail wind and planet jupiter being in the right place.  it can be repeated at will, though with difficulty; i have two black eyes right now from concentrating too hard for too many hours .  

  thats why people are reluctant to try .  the reason the nearly obsolete mrf 571 works where better transistors dont is that it cannot handle much power, which is why it heats and cools quicker than the latest ones.  the whole process of getting it to work would take weeks instead of hours with any comparable microwave transistor

what do you imagine that mechanism is?
quantum wormholes or some such?
I like this superresonance concept but only find it
associated with black holes in the lit, but am anxious
to see how you've been continuing to develop this
thread. I think it has reader appeal once we can give
it more context. Anyway, it appeals to me.
