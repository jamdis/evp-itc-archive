It probably\nuses a loop as the field source and wouldn&#39;t have much of a range. You could\nprobably build one for $20 or less depending on how knowledgeable you were\nand how good a scrounger. Using a microcontroller and scrounged parts it\nmight be as low as $5 to build. I&#39;m an EE by profession; I can think of\nseveral ways to go about it.\nIt&#39;s not the same as Frank&#39;s box or any other receiver. It isn&#39;t a receiver.\nI guess it is either supposed to enhance reception or actually attract\nghosts as an energy source.\n\nZack\n\nOn Sat, Nov 28, 2009 at 11:47 PM, ppsmeet@...\n&lt;ppsmeet@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; So let me ask you this then: An EM Pump= amplified white noise?
