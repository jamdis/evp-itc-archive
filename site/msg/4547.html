<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi All, I was able to get Sarah&#x27;s book, &quot;Voices Of Eternity&quot;, not long ago from Ebay = what a great book it is &amp; so inspiring!!!  I hadn&#x27;t heard she is sick or anything . . . what&#x27;s going on with her? I&#x27;d like to send out Prayers her way! Thanks.  =Judy=

&gt; Sarah is such a brave visionary. Jen &amp; I met her at the Atlanta AA-EVP 
&gt; meeting a few years ago and she was surprised that attendees wanted 
&gt; their photos taken with her and asked for her autograph. It&#x27;s folks 
&gt; like her and others in this field, including some of the participants 
&gt; of this forum, that keep the research moving forward.
&gt; 
&gt; We&#x27;ll make sure Sarah is in our thoughts during this holiday season. -

&gt; &gt; As most of us know, Sarah Estep, was the founder of the AA-EVP--the  
&gt; &gt; route by I, and many of us, first got to the place we&#x27;re at today.  
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve heard from a friend of mine who is also of that generation of  
&gt; &gt; EVP tapers, that Sarah&#x27;s condition is deteriorating. I&#x27;d like to ask  
&gt; &gt; all of you to send positive thoughts her way, as she was always a  
&gt; &gt; very gracious lady who was more than helpful to many, many people 
&gt; who  
&gt; &gt; were interested in taping. I bought my first equipment from Sarah&#x27;s  
&gt; &gt; husband and benefited greatly from her wisdom, always given freely.  
&gt; &gt; She will be remembered as giant in this field.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Please think of her kindly this Christmas Eve.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ann
