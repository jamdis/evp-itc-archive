<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes yes, like my husband and counterpart said, it&#x27;s just a radio shack 
hack. It&#x27;s new to us, and new to our state. (As far as we know). So 
it&#x27;s pretty big for us. We had a chance to use it, and the minibox that 
Rob from Deadscience has, last night at the Seattle Museum of 
Mysteries. Pretty interesting. We worked it, discussed it, and batted 
around ideas of adaption, or improvments, that could possibly be made. 
It&#x27;s not a &quot;new box&quot; .. .just new to us. It&#x27;s like a teenager with 
a &quot;new used&quot; car. LOL.

Thank you guys so much for being here, answering questions and being so 
open and helpful. It helps us out when we have questions. Good luck to 
all of you!! 

Sincerely
Regan
