  I have done this before in fact just recently.  I did it with my brother's fatherinlaw 2 days after he died.  My technician helped me out and went and got this guy for me and I just about flipped when his voice actually came over the radio.  Unfortunately it did not record.  It was only meant for my ears.

I know for me, when someone makes their transition after having lived a long, full life, it 
isn't as hard for me to deal with because it's just sad, not tragic (if that makes sense.) I 
hope your great aunt and uncle are enjoying a glorious reunion! :-)
