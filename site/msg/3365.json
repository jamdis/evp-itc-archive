THE FILES I HAVE POSTED ARE GLEENED FROM \nONLY THE FIRST MINUTE OR SO OF A TEN MINUTE RECORDING.PLEASE TAKE A \nMINUTE TO LISTEN AND POST YOUR FEEDBACK.\n\nTHE FILES ARE POSTED IN THE FILE SECTION UNDER: \n\n11-26-07_radio shack hack files_Bruce \n\nAFTER DOING ONLY ONE RECORDED SESSION AND TWO SESSIONS TOTAL. I AS A \nSERIOUS BOX RESEARCHER WITH EVRYDAY EXPERIMENTING ON FRANK&#39;S,JOE&#39;S \nAND NOW THE RADIO SHACK HACK BOX CAN PREMATURELY SAY THAT THIS RADIO \nMAY BE SMALL IN SIZE BUT IT PACKS A BIG PUNCH ! AND IT WAS UNDER OUR \nVERY NOSES ALL THE TIME. THANKS TO SUM DUC FOR HIS INSIGHT IN \nDISCOVERING IT.\n\nAT THE RISK OF SOUNDING REDUNDENT I MUST REITERATE THIS RS BOX WILL \nHOLD IT&#39;S OWN WITH THE BIG BOYS. THE RESULTS AND LEVEL OF \nCOMMUNICATION BOTH IN REAL TIME DURING A SESSION AND WHAT IS MISSED \nBY OUR RUDIMENTARY HUMAN HEARING AND CAUGHT ON A RECORDING RIVALS OR \nMAY EVEN GIVEN ENOUGH TIME FOR FREQUENCY IMPRINTING BY OUR SPIRIT \nFRIENDS AND PROPER RESEARCH METHODS WILL SURPASS JOE&#39;S BOX AND PULL A \nCLOSE SECOND TO FRANK&#39;S BOX. \n\nAS A MATTER OF FACT MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE RS BOX WAS REMINICENT \nOF THE AM LINEAR MODE OF MY FRANKS BOX #12. LET&#39;S FACE IT A FRANKS \nBOX IS A FRANKS BOX IN AS NO TWO ARE EXACTLY THE SAME THAT IS WHAT \nMAKES THEM SO UNIQUE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT I BELIEVE A SMALL PART OF \nFRANK HIMSELF TRANSFERS INTO EVERY BOX HE MAKES AND HE IS VERY WELL \nRESPECTED ON THE OTHER SIDE FROM WHAT MY GUIDES AND TECHS TELL ME.\n\nI HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE RON RICKETS MINI BOX YET BUT I \nAM HEARING VERY GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT&#39;S PERFORMANCE ALSO AND CAN NOT \nWAIT TO EXPERIMENT WITH IT.\n\nI THINK OUR FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE FINALY DECIDING TO PUSH \nFORWARD WITH THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS AND ALLOW IT TO BECOME \nACCESABLE TO MANY MORE PEOPLE. WHAT THEY HAVE CONVEYED TO ME OVER \nNUMEROUS SESSIONS IS THE DESPERATE AND INTRIGAL NEED FOR COMBINED \nHARMONY AMONG RESEARCHERS AND COMMUNICATORS. THE MORE MINDS THAT ARE \nTHINKING AND MOVING TOGETHER FOR THIS COMMON GOAL THE STRONGER THE \nSPIRITS ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE AND THEY WILL HELP WITH DEVELOPE MENT \nOF THE TECHNOLOGY SO THINGS ARE LOOKING UP AND HEADING TO THE FUTURE. \n\nWHAT I HAVE GATHERED OVER MANY SESSIONS IS THEY DEFINATELY WANT THE \nWORD AND THE TECHNOLOGY SPREAD TO AS MANY AS ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT IT \nWITH AN OPEN MIND. I AM RATTLING ON AND HAVE DRIFTED FROM MY ORIGINAL \nPOINT WHICH WAS, THIS RADIO SHACK BOX IS AND WILL BE A VERY IMPORTANT \nAND USEFULL TOOL IN FURTHERING OUR COMMUNICATION PROCESS.\n\nTHANKS FOR LISTENING.\n\nBRUCE"}
