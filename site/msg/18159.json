This experiment asked for participants to =\r\ndetermine what that object was. Vague or partial answers would not be count=\r\ned (for example, just giving a color, shape, size, what it&#39;s made of, etc):=\r\n we&#39;re looking for what it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver tim=\r\ne Monday won&#39;t count. Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders=\r\n, or any other means they chose. \n\n\nIn order to keep me honest, I took a pi=\r\ncture of the object at the start of the experiment and loaded it to the Fil=\r\nes section (RJ folder) of this group. The idea with this file is that you c=\r\nould download it at the beginning of the experiment and &#39;keep it safe&#39; on y=\r\nour computer. Then at the end of the experiment, I would post the password =\r\nso you can reveal the contents of the file.
