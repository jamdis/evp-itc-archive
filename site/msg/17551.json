Unfortunatley \n&gt; you  \n&gt; &gt; will hear her say what she thinks she hears in the files. Please try  not \n&gt; &gt; to be influenced by her. I will admit though that she seems to  hear \n&gt; these \n&gt; &gt; things much better then I can.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though I  am still not convinced, some of these are uncanny, and I was \n&gt; &gt;  surprised. I will be conducting ongoing, regular experiments with  this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Opinions are welcome.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt;  April\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
