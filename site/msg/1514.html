<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>A friend e-mailed me through my web site about a problem in her home.  
It&#x27;s the first time i took the box out of my house to try it out.  The 
spirits were so nasty and evil all they did was curse and threaten my 
friend&#x27;s boyfriend Ed.  This is the first time i&#x27;ve experienced the 
evil side of the box, i usually get &quot;hi&quot; and nice gestures like that.  
I did help them resolve who was there though.  I got specific names 
and why they were haunting the place and also got some background info 
from them after the session with the box.  I also had EMF spikes off 
the charts.  I got 2 than 6 than .1 and back to 4.  Really active 
house, but i hope i helped with the box.  Everyone was able to 
understand the box and communictate with me to them.  Awesome session 
and i&#x27;m looking forward to the future of new boxes.

Thanx everyone for your support
-Steve H.</pre>
