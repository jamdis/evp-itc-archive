Thanks again for everyone who participated! I admire your =
 courage and 
motivation to try different methods, see what works, and  try=
 to improve 
everyone's understanding of EVP-ITC.

If you  recall, on 7/10/=
2010 I placed an object on top of my computer  
monitor, right in front of =
me, and left it there until today,  7/14/2010, noon 
Denver time. The exper=
iment was for participants to  determine what it was. 
Vague or partial ans=
wers wouldn't be counted  (for example, just colors, 
shapes, sizes, what i=
t's made of, etc):  we're looking for what it is. 
Participants could use t=
heir ghost  boxes, EVP recorders, or I suppose any other 
means they  chose=
.

In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the  object at the start=
 of 
the experiment and loaded it to the Files  section (RJ folder) of this=
 
group. If you can follow the link, it is  here:

_http://tech. groups.yah=
oo. com/group/  EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710. 
1.zip_ (http://tech.groups.=
yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip) 

The idea was that  yo=
u could download the file at the beginning of the 
test, and 'keep  it safe=
' on your computer. Then at the end of the test, I would 
 release the pass=
word so you could reveal the contents of the file.  That 
way, you were in =
control of the original image during the  entire test, not 
me. 

The passw=
ord for that file is:  123BlastOff
Instructions, if you need them, are also=
 in that RJ  folder.

And if you did not care to download the zip file  bef=
ore the test, I will 
post the final image there too.

So to  the results:
=

Number of participants: 5
Total tries:  8
Ambiguous answers: 0
Correct ans=
wers: 0

Object: A  radio
Uzipped picture:
_http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/=
group/  EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710. 
1.JPG_ (http://tech.groups.yahoo.co=
m/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG) 

So what do the  results mean?=
 All that we can really agree on from this 
experiment  is that no particip=
ant, with whatever theories or methods or  
technology they used, was able =
to correctly determine the object. We  can't say 
those theories or methods=
 or technologies never work. Just  as we can't say 
they do. Just that, for=
 whatever reason, they did  not work this time. 
Readers can take the resul=
ts, use them to  improve or change their methods, or 
keep doing what they'=
re  doing.

If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for  improve=
ment, let me 
know. I hope to get a new experiment up and  running soon. Si=
nce there 
wasn't much participation Mon-Wed, I think  the next experiment =
will be arranged 
to mostly span the  weekends.

Again, thanks to everyone =
who participated in this  first experiment.
