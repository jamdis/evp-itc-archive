Manipulating EMF is one thing.=C2=A0 But directly storing bits on a media =
is way beyond that.=C2=A0 Bits are not stored in a continuous stream.=C2=A0=
 They are broken into bytes (little packets) that is totally controlled by =
the processor and software.=C2=A0 For Elvis to "encode directly" to the med=
ia, he would have to do what that software does to the digital signals comi=
ng in from the AtoD converter: he would have to group the bits into (for ex=
ample) 16 little herds each, decide on the specific bit interpretation sche=
me (2's complement?),=C2=A0 find space on the media, update the media's dic=
tionary of where there is free space and where there isn't, link the herds =
together with some sort of linked pointer, skip around the areas marked 'ba=
d' on the media, update things like date/time modified and size, respect an=
y kind of ownership permissions on the media, and so on.

It is much more c=
redible for the signal to be manipulated near the AtoD converter (where EMF=
 changes would have the most straighforward result) than in the digital med=
ia itself.
