I had an acquaintance about 10 years \nago who told me he was Nikola Tesla last lifetime.  His knowledge and \nskill with electricity/electronics and his personality traits REALLY bore \nthis out. You couldn&#39;t behave any more like Nikola Tesla unless you&#39;d \nstudied his entire existence in minute detail. I&#39;m sure he had not done \nthat.\n\nIf that&#39;s the case, Nikola Tesla walks the earth now under a new and \ndifferent identity and isn&#39;t in &quot;another plane&quot; at all.\n\nZack\n\nOn Fri, 16 Nov 2007, juli velazquez wrote:\n\n&gt; Ann, this is a theory, maybe a crazy one and could be far off, but I&#39;m going to throw it out there.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I think that this may be in reference to the boxes.  (I think some of these messages that are delivered have to be looked at from a different angle).  Correct me if I am wrong (which I probably am) but don&#39;t these different boxes use different frequencies for example (am vs fm).  Telsa was believe one worked better for long distances and just maybe that is the message in which is trying to be conveyed???  That one may actually receive better transmission.  Telsa also believe that he could in fact contact Mars and Venus (which proved to be stars? (if I am correct).  In any event.  I think that you need to analyze the parties involved and apply them to which is actually going on now at this period of time.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I think that there are different plains and one may work better for say contacted the death, verses another for contacting differently life forms in the universe.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I know you probably think I am so out there, but this was just a thought from an outsiders perspective.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;          But what is going on now? Why all of a sudden is everyone hearing from Edison and Tesla? If these are the real men, what are they up to? Are they trying to divide and concur or are they working together?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Ann"}
