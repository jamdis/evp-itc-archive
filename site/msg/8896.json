This recorder is really  strange, it \nseems like it doesn&#39;t have great sound quality for recording  us.  The answers \nare much clearer than the questions.  I know this  isn&#39;t box research, but it&#39;s \nstill communication.  Like i said, i never  settle on one style.  To me, all \nstyles work and if you mix it up it will  never get boring as long as we are \ngetting results.  Here are just  a few traditional Evp&#39;s i thought were pretty \ngood and worth sharing, the  thing is that i hardly had to touch these files.  \nWhat you hear is pretty  close to the original files, listen and let me know \nwhat you guys think.   Has anybody else got good stuff from this panasonic \nrecorder, if so i would love  to hear it.\n \n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n**************Planning your summer road trip?
