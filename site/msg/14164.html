Be a bit careful of formats like mp3 if you are doing a detailed analysis o=
f the sounds though.=A0=A0 While some formats (like wav) can store the audi=
o very close to the way it was recorded, formats like mp3 compress the file=
, and in so doing lose some of the sonic details.=A0 This may not be a big =
deal in music, where the audio is fairly clear to begin with.=A0 But with s=
ound sources with a lot of noise (like evps), this can not only obscure any=
 real sounds, but pixelize non-sounds (like white noise) and make them star=
t to sound like speech.

So mp3 might be good for sharing the data, once yo=
u've already formed an opinion based on an analysis of the wav file.=A0 But=
 mp3 is not good as a medium for analysis.=A0 It can lead to many false pos=
itives and misinterpretations.
