Bob Shannon and I became good friends via e-mail back in the 90&#x27;s. Then he
kind of disappeared off cyberspace. I haven&#x27;t tried to track him down lately
so I don&#x27;t know what happened to him.

&gt; The device on the webpage listed looks damn impressive.  Unfortunately I am
&gt; a electro-ignoramus, but reading the description of the device was quite
&gt; intriguing.  I cannot assemble such devices, but I can understand their use.
&gt;  This device appears to have a wonderful range of application.
&gt;
&gt; Is there any video online of this device being used? My curiosity is
&gt; piqued.
