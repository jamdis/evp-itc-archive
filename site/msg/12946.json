It&#39;s similar to what you \nhave listed except it has both a regular audio microphone and the emf \npickup device, all in one amplified device.\n\nHere is the How-To stuff.:\n\nHere is a way to make a combined induction and audio amplified \nmicrophone that you can listen LIVE while you&#39;re recording.\nUsing this device you can now search for audio EVPs with the regular \nmicrophone and other type energy EVP/ITC with the induction device, \nboth at the same time.\n\nHere&#39;s the link to the exact page:\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com/prototypes/prototypespage10.htm\n\nHere&#39;s a link to page 1:\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com/prototypes/\n\n- Mike C.

Now--\n--If  the \n&gt; theory is true than if EMF detectors pick up spirit than a \nmicrophone for  EMF \n&gt; should pick up spirit voices...Right???\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have broken down this by part #&#39;s and it&#39;s easily sourced at the \nlocal  \n&gt; radio shack to test out.  I&#39;ve had this for years now, but haven&#39;t  \nexperimented \n&gt; enough with it.

I just tried it with the mic  jack on \nmy frank&#39;s \n&gt; box and got some interesting results.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Just something to think about,\n&gt;  \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; ____________________________________\n&gt;  Life should be easier.
