Hi Everyone!

I'm new and I stumbled onto this group =
after doing some research
online into EVP. I consider myself to be a parano=
rmal skeptic, but I
have heard some very interesting EVP evidence and would=
 like to look
into it further. I joined this group because I am interested =
in
submitting EVP data to some rigorous scientific analysis. I'm an
electri=
cal engineer and mainly work in the areas of signal processing
and communic=
ations so all of this is extremely interesting. 

I am interested in collec=
ting some of my own data (at some point) by
building a ghost box based on F=
rank Sumption's designs. I am working
from the "Ghost Box Notebook" from 20=
07, but I am having a hard time
getting started. Has anyone built one of th=
ese and are there any
parts lists or more complete schematics floating arou=
nd? I would
appreciate any build help or advice any of you might have.

Reg=
ards,

Anna
