<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve spent a portion of the day researching the block diagram of the original spiricom device. I saw there was room for improvement with the ghost box movement we are aware of. Being a musician, i have a room all set up with most of the components of the spiricom system already. What i did was study the block diagram and instead of adding an AM receiver, i added the Sangean AM receiver to sweep instead of using an off station. For the tones, i used my laptop using evp assistant mic&#x27;d through my PA system. I also incorporated tape deck noise for tone and an RF transmitter that i had to make my guitar wireless originally and on the receiver end of the transmitter i used the AM sweep. I posted 2 youtube videos, the first one was a little dark but the communication was good to listen to. Let me know what you think of this.

Here are the links to the videos:
