          Hi Misty .. Thanks so much for listening! I used my Son's clock 
radio to record those .. turning the dial back and forth really fast 
while speaking and listening recording with DC6. Many are using DC7 
now .. I haven't tried DC7 yet but all you need to do is press 
the "LIVE" button and wear headphones and you will hear the played-
back version (1/4 second delay) and just keep listening and 
answering . It took me a while to learn how to speak without hearing 
myself talk (because of the headphones) ... (You need headphones that 
cover your ear or ear buds so that the recorder doesn't record itself 
playing back .. 

I belive their are some free recording programs that play-back as 
you're recording .. I'll post them when I find them!
