  Frank,
  To someone that we all look up to as an insperation I can say that you can make the best box ever and the results might just depend on the person or user of the product...
  Keep working in this direction, keep being a good person.  Remember one thing, we are the light in the darkness!  There will always be people that will try to rain on OUR parade.  We have to be the voice of reason so WE can move forward.  This is not about us!  Its about TRUTH and the light and research.  Thanks for everything you have done and continue to do!!
  I think personally that these devices work best when the user is not using the device for personal gain, but for everyones best intrests!!
   
  Happy New Year!

      I don't know if maybe the audio pick up from the box wasn't very good, 
but I can't make out much of that either. It sounds like the recordings 
I do with a cell phone. I think you'd have to be there to judge it. 

Personally I'm always disappointed at my stuff being out there, and 
the incredible lack of clarity obatained with it, to me that's a huge 
failure! I know the stuff works, but how to get it to a level that can 
be understood by most, that's the problem, and my focus at the moment. 
The Mini Box is big step in that direction, so some of the pressure if 
off, but I still need to get my boxes to professional level.
