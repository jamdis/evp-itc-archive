<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Chris actually said that he was told that only 30 people in our 
country could use the box.  I agree with what you are saying.  That 
makes sense.  I&#x27;m just relating what we were told on Saturday by 
Chris Moon.

&gt; i think that hes talking about, like EVP, where some people 
automatically get messages and others NEVER get em.

That would be awesome, but Chris said not everyone would be able to 
use 
&gt; them? Is that true, Frank, that only certain people were supposed 
to 
&gt; be able to use the boxes?

&gt; &gt; you know frank, maybe making these boxes will be your FT calling. 
I 
&gt; bet that if you started looking for partners and financial backing 
that 
&gt; people would come out of the woodwork to back you. Putting these 
into 
&gt; production might be a good thing. Not to mention the people that 
would 
&gt; colaborate to help out with any design flaws.
&gt; &gt; just a thought.
