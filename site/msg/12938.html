<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks... I wonder if its a show with Dr. Roger Leir?  He specializes 
in implants and the such.  When I met him I attempted to talk with him 
about one of the shows I saw him on where he was using a certain meter 
near the implant he had removed.
He was receiving frequencies, but they appeared to be coming, not from 
the implant, but from the entire area he was measuring.
He really didn&#x27;t want to listen to me... I guess some of those guys 
have their agendas or strong opinions and want to stick to them.
Most of those implants look like splinters to me... :-)

other
