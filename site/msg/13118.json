I will be the first to contest that what you =\r\nhear\nis something that&#39;s definitely there. After I continued to get nothing=\r\n\nbut negative experiences during my EVP, I decided to just forget it.\nWell =\r\nthe things messing with me have not really agreed with me on that.\n\nJust la=\r\nst Friday, I went to a party of my friends and I took a picture\nof somethin=\r\ng odd. This is a real picture folks and I challenge anyone to\nfind a made u=\r\np flaw in it. The first one circles the entities and the\nsecond one is just=\r\n the original file. I know this doesn&#39;t pertain\nmuch to the EVP realm, but =\r\nit&#39;s a follow up from an experience of\none, which now proves the legitimacy=\r\n off this field=85..pictures\nalways speak a thousand words.\n\nI really would=\r\n like to think that I am too stubborn for anything even\nmore serious to hap=\r\npen, as I am just considering them a nuisance now. I\nwill be seeking a high=\r\ner power either today or very soon. If you guys\ndon&#39;t hear from me again, I=\r\n just may be possessed=85.&lt;gulps&gt;\n\nOutlined Pic\n&lt;http://i319.photobucket.co=\r\nm/albums/mm458/djdetale_photos/CircledParty_P&#92;\nic-1.jpg&gt;\n\nOriginal Pic\n&lt;htt=\r\np://i319.photobucket.com/albums/mm458/djdetale_photos/OriginalParty_&#92;\nPic-1=\r\n.jpg&gt;\n\n\n\n-Chuck\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;chuck255&quot; &lt;chuck255@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; My name is Chuck and I stumbled upon this site and its informati=\r\non\n&gt; while trying to figure out what&#39;s going on in my crazy life. Before I\n=\r\n&gt; get into that let me explain a bit about myself. I am a male in his\n&gt; 30&#39;=\r\ns, who has Bachelors in Regional Development, with a minor in\n&gt; Computer Sc=\r\nience. I work at a respective power plant company within\n&gt; Arizona doing GI=\r\nS Tech Work. I get drug tested at it on random\n&gt; occasion and I really only=\r\n drink socially, or on some holiday\n&gt; occasions. I have always been a logic=\r\nal kind of thinker my whole life\n&gt; and never really had any &quot;belief&quot; in the=\r\n paranormal, even though my\n&gt; mom and brother strongly do.\n&gt;\n&gt; I feel so we=\r\nird even trying to explain this story because about a\n&gt; week ago I would ha=\r\nve thought of it as silly. About a year ago I met\n&gt; someone else, who for n=\r\now ill call B. I fell madly in love with her\n&gt; and after a short time I was=\r\n more than happy to have her come and\n&gt; live with me at my new place. In so=\r\nme strange way I always felt as if\n&gt; there was something about B I could ne=\r\nver quite understand. After\n&gt; about 3-4 months of living with her I started=\r\n to get the inclination\n&gt; that B was cheating on me. Her stories never adde=\r\nd up, her job was\n&gt; secretive and she started stumbling on her words a lot.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I then started getting spy gadgets, because she was staying with me\n&gt; =\r\nand I was concerned about my place along with her activities there. I\n&gt; at =\r\nfirst just got a digital recorder, but then after time I started\n&gt; to get a=\r\nggravated and felt that the digital recordings were just\n&gt; being used to pl=\r\nay and taunt me. So then I went to the extent of\n&gt; getting Cameras and even=\r\n Camcorders. Whenever I would ask about\n&gt; something peculiar, I got tears a=\r\nnd a really heartfelt reaction that\n&gt; really made me believe her. I felt li=\r\nke we really loved one another\n&gt; and I could really see some care in her ey=\r\nes, so most of the time I\n&gt; just gave in to what she said as true, but didn=\r\nt have enough to stop\n&gt; looking. I felt like I had been in enough relations=\r\nhips to know the\n&gt; difference here. I have seen the act before and it reall=\r\ny didn&#39;t look\n&gt; that way here, unless she was just really that good at fool=\r\ning\n&gt; people.\n&gt;\n&gt; During the course of our stay there she would pitch a hug=\r\ne fit if I\n&gt; had to leave her at the apartment alone and would stop at noth=\r\ning to\n&gt; try and be in my company instead. But I started to get aggravated =\r\nas\n&gt; time progressed and knew something was up, because of the odd voices\n&gt;=\r\n I would hear within the recordings. I made her stay there will trying\n&gt; to=\r\n sneak back and see who was messing with her around my place. I\n&gt; lost it b=\r\necause I couldn&#39;t pinpoint it at all and last July and got\n&gt; into a fight r=\r\night outside of my place with three other people. She\n&gt; always told me she =\r\ntalked to her self when I qestioned other voices\n&gt; and I never could see an=\r\nyone else there when she did, even with the\n&gt; cameras, so I had no choice b=\r\nut to continue on believeing her\nstill=85=85\n&gt; even though my feelings woul=\r\ndn&#39;t agree to her words.\n&gt;\n&gt; For some odd reason it just seemed as if she k=\r\nnew where the cameras\n&gt; and recorders were every time, just by the way she =\r\nwould exit and\n&gt; enter the apartment. So then I started putting them outsid=\r\ne and about\n&gt; a month ago something crazy happened. I started listening to =\r\na\n&gt; digital recording and at the beginning of it I flat out heard B\n&gt; cheat=\r\ning on me with someone. I was upset and happy at the same time\n&gt; that I fin=\r\nally had caught it and as a result I sent her away. She\n&gt; left town because=\r\n all her family was in another city. She couldn&#39;t\n&gt; stop crying and was hys=\r\nterical, especially when she saw I was\n&gt; devastated too. I thought that I h=\r\nad finally gotten my answers and\n&gt; she was just the best actress I had ever=\r\n known, end of story. She\n&gt; tried to kill herself a couple of times while t=\r\nhis was going on a\n&gt; couple months back. If it was as an act or not, I real=\r\nly just don&#39;t\n&gt; know. But when she left last she left a note telling me not=\r\n to let\n&gt; her die and she hopes that I find her soon before her heart stopp=\r\ned.\n&gt; Me=85..I said more BS and threw the note in the garbage.\n&gt;\n&gt; A couple=\r\n of day&#39;s later curiosity got the best of me and I started\n&gt; listening to t=\r\nhe rest of the recording. I then started to hear what\n&gt; sounded like people=\r\n monitoring ME and calling me a &quot;Threat&quot;. I\n&gt; immediately start acting alar=\r\nmed. Then in the recording I hear B exit\n&gt; the apartment in disgust after I=\r\n stormed off that night, as we were\n&gt; fighting about something weird yet ag=\r\nain. After I had left she\n&gt; started talking about setting up a &quot;Private Mee=\r\nting&quot; with some other\n&gt; people and something about boating. Well during the=\r\n beginning of this\n&gt; meeting I heard a reference to a crazy accusation that=\r\n I had made at\n&gt; B awhile ago, which to me at the time confirmed she was in=\r\n the Mafia.\n&gt; That explained all the weirdness to me and during this meetin=\r\ng the\n&gt; voices changed a bunch as if they sounded &quot;Masked&quot; or &quot;Disguised&quot;, =\r\nso\n&gt; I really had to amp up the volume.\n&gt;\n&gt; The next day and every day afte=\r\nr from this point on I amped up the\n&gt; volume in the recording. I also had t=\r\no distinguish the masked voice\n&gt; by breaking the large file into smaller se=\r\ngments of two to four\n&gt; second intervals, in order to piece the entire reco=\r\nrdings meaning\n&gt; together. Over time I started to interpret the masked voic=\r\nes better\n&gt; because I thought I was tuning my ears better to them. The voic=\r\nes in\n&gt; these recordings were two different males, B and some other female.=\r\n I\n&gt; later on saw in the recording that they had actually seen the\n&gt; record=\r\ning but weren&#39;t taking it, which was EXTREMELY odd to me\n&gt; considering they=\r\n had been caught. Why not destroy the evidence?\n&gt;\n&gt; Then I heard one of the=\r\n males say that he was the &quot;Boss of the\n&gt; Southwest Mafia&quot; and that I was g=\r\noing to pay for hurting B like this.\n&gt; He also said that my being a nuisanc=\r\ne in the apartment had messed up\n&gt; his business within the area and all my =\r\nspy stuff had really pissed\n&gt; him off. He told me I was dead, my daughter a=\r\nlong with me and more\n&gt; than likely my whole family as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; He knew wh=\r\nere my mom and dad lived and some information I didn&#39;t even\n&gt; tell B. I fre=\r\nak out and figure the damn mob is after me. I keep\n&gt; listening and he says =\r\n&quot;If I don&#39;t move away and discontinue my\n&gt; interactions with my daughter by=\r\n December 5th, that he would know\n&gt; that I was just playing with B and then=\r\n my whole family is dead&quot;.\n&gt; This was exactly one month from when I had use=\r\nd the recording device\n&gt; too by the way. I moved out and away from my daugh=\r\nter breaking the\n&gt; tie and in tears the whole time too because I couldnt ex=\r\nplain why. I\n&gt; really did it because I feared for their lives of my family =\r\nand felt\n&gt; that we would all die if f I didnt.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile B and met some=\r\none else that ill name J for now. After\n&gt; knowing him for two days she deci=\r\nded to bring him back with her to\n&gt; pick up her things out of the apartment=\r\n. I was kicking her out of it\n&gt; by the way. I thought it was just to piss m=\r\ne off and I forgot about\n&gt; it. Then I heard as I progressed in the recordin=\r\ng J&#39;s name brought\n&gt; up. Supposedly they knew him and he was in their mob a=\r\nnd I needed to\n&gt; go attack him to prove myself, or else B will never be see=\r\nn from me\n&gt; again. I also hear that I can&#39;t go to certain places at certain=\r\n times\n&gt; where B might be and furthermore think that they didnt take the\n&gt; =\r\nrecorder because the damn thing has to be planned down to the times I\n&gt; wou=\r\nld hear it.\n&gt;\n&gt; At this time I am in fear for my life and my families, lost=\r\n my love\n&gt; and I am not understanding how the recording is so damn well tim=\r\ne\n&gt; planned, figured im going crazy. Then something ill never forget\n&gt; happ=\r\nens. I am spoken directly too and I figure its me going of the\n&gt; deep end n=\r\now. I try and test my sanity and go to different parts of\n&gt; the recording o=\r\nnly to get the same thing kind of direct question. I\n&gt; am in disarray at th=\r\nis point! I stand up and walk around, trying to\n&gt; figure out just what the =\r\nhell is going on with me. I get back on and\n&gt; further see that my verbal qu=\r\nestions are now being answered instantly\n&gt; by this recording (Which is mere=\r\nly a sound file on the pc). *I was\n&gt; using Sound Forge by the way if anyone=\r\n wanted to know what sound\n&gt; software I was using was*.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have so littl=\r\ne sleep at this point and I am told that I need to do\n&gt; all this crazy stuf=\r\nf and drive out to the middle of some hotel right\n&gt; then and there, to furt=\r\nher see them, as I have passed all their tests\n&gt; to get into their mafia no=\r\nw. As a reward B would be there waiting for\n&gt; me too. I hurry to do it and =\r\nrush there but no one is even their to\n&gt; answer the door. I go back and get=\r\n a yelling voice at me that I had\n&gt; left to early and immediatly go back. M=\r\ne not wanting to piss the mob\n&gt; boss anymore, I take the 45 minute trip aga=\r\nin and go back. But when I\n&gt; get there it just didn&#39;t feel right to me and =\r\nI never exited the car,\n&gt; especially when I saw the numbers in vehicles had=\r\nnt changed in the\n&gt; parking lot. I had plenty reason to be paranoid at this=\r\n point and\n&gt; truly felt in danger.I left and thought I was done for when I =\r\ngot\n&gt; back. Instead, he tells me that he was impressed by my decision when\n=\r\n&gt; and literally puts me in tears when he said that because of my\n&gt; intellig=\r\nence, I had won my families lives back, but not my own yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; All this is=\r\n done by him also telling me that he can physically see me\n&gt; through his ad=\r\nvanced mafia technology on the computer monitor. He\n&gt; also tells me to to m=\r\nove things around on my compter desk that were\n&gt; between the sight of me an=\r\nd the computer monitor, while demanding I\n&gt; correct my posture when speakin=\r\ng to him. He also states that he is\n&gt; watching my every move and if I tell =\r\nanyone anything they die along\n&gt; with me.\n&gt;\n&gt; I make no sense of this and I=\r\n was completely baffled on how I was\n&gt; being communicated with. I had just =\r\nmoved and there was no internet\n&gt; connection even. Me just being happy my f=\r\namily is safe, I decide to\n&gt; go to sleep. Feeling as though I am now sleep =\r\ndeprived and going\n&gt; crazy from the stress, I go to sleep for two days cons=\r\nistently, as\n&gt; this was during the Thanksgiving holiday time. I would purpo=\r\nsely make\n&gt; myself sleep longer when I woke to ensure I didn&#39;t belong in th=\r\ne\n&gt; loony bin.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I finally woke up I was determined to find an expla=\r\nnation to how\n&gt; they were talking to me, I go to the library and look into =\r\nBluetooth\n&gt; technology, telephony, and remoting into a computer=85..anythin=\r\ng.\nThen\n&gt; I realize=85=85..that I can find out just how crazy I really am b=\r\ny\nmoving\n&gt; the recording and listening to it elsewhere. I then decide to ta=\r\nke\n&gt; the same recording into my work to test my saneness, along with the\n&gt; =\r\nfile itself. If its was on my home CPU=85.then it&#39;s going to now be\nat\n&gt; my=\r\n work one too right? I do and get the same damn thing, not to\n&gt; mention tha=\r\nt the &quot;Mob Boss&quot; now has company two others when I speak\n&gt; to him. All of t=\r\nhem yelling at me for moving their sensive\n&gt; information.\n&gt;\n&gt; During this t=\r\nime I invest in GPS, GSM, 3G and several signal blocking\n&gt; devices, in orde=\r\nr to prohibit myself from being tracked any further.\n&gt; They never worked or=\r\n even phased the &quot;Mob Boss&quot;. But I would still\n&gt; check the recording in the=\r\n evening just to hear what I needed to do\n&gt; in order to be making them happ=\r\ny and get the possibility to see B\n&gt; again. The &quot;Mob Boss&quot; had told me that=\r\n it was all just a test for me\n&gt; to see if I loved her and she never really=\r\n did do anything. They\n&gt; continue to tell me over and over that I have to b=\r\neat up J in order\n&gt; to prove myself to B. That this is what everyone is rea=\r\nlly waiting on\n&gt; and if I would just go up to the other town and get it ove=\r\nr with,\n&gt; then I can bring her back with me. I won&#39;t do it and say that I w=\r\non&#39;t\n&gt; fight for anything that doesn&#39;t want to be fought for. Basically\n&gt; s=\r\naying that B can call me about it if she really wants it. Then as a\n&gt; resul=\r\nt they start threatening my family again. At this point, I\n&gt; really can&#39;t e=\r\nven express to you how much of a wreck I am. But I felt\n&gt; like I needed to =\r\nbe strong for my family and get on the mob&#39;s good\n&gt; side so I can fix the m=\r\ness I created.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well it never really happened and this torment went on f=\r\nor a good\n&gt; week, while I was moving everything I could as fast as I could =\r\nin\n&gt; order to make their deadline and save everyone. Everyday I would do\n&gt; =\r\nwhat I thought was expected of me and hope it wouldnt make them mad\n&gt; in on=\r\ne breath, while in the other breath win back my complete\n&gt; freedom, away fr=\r\nom their bad side. No matter where I was or what I\n&gt; did during the day the=\r\ny usually seemed to know about it when I talked\n&gt; to them in the evening. I=\r\nt really bothered me that I couldnt find out\n&gt; where they were putting the =\r\n&quot;bugs&quot;, or even better how they were\n&gt; doing all of it. My inability to &quot;be=\r\nlieve&quot; in the paranormal really\n&gt; hurt me here.\n&gt;\n&gt; Since the apartment tha=\r\nt B and I had used was empty at this time and\n&gt; a friend of mine was down o=\r\nn his luck, I gave him the apartment for\n&gt; free until the lease was complet=\r\nely up. After about a week of me\n&gt; doing this, I walked in and found guns a=\r\nnd ammo everywhere and\n&gt; freaked the hell out. That&#39;s the last thing I need=\r\ned when I thought\n&gt; the mob was just down the street! I made everyone there=\r\n except my\n&gt; friend leave, with quite a fuss I might add. Then I headed bac=\r\nk to my\n&gt; home to see how the mob felt about what I did, assure they would =\r\nbe\n&gt; impressed that I had looked out for them. Instead the regular female\n&gt;=\r\n that was always with the &quot;Mob Boss&quot; now asked me why I didn&#39;t finish\n&gt; the=\r\n job, stating that there was still someone there and it made them\n&gt; all ang=\r\nry. They demanded that I go back especially to see just how &quot;I\n&gt; finished i=\r\nt&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; So like the puppet I was at that time, I went back. I didn&#39;t have t=\r\nhe\n&gt; heart to put him on the street, even though he had put me at a major\n&gt;=\r\n risk and instead I just found another place for him to stay. On the\n&gt; way =\r\nthere I bought him some water and some smokes. When we got there\n&gt; I even h=\r\nelped him move in and explained that it wasn&#39;t me that did\n&gt; it, but the le=\r\nasing office had saw all the guns. As a result they had\n&gt; made me do it. I =\r\nthought he made a poor decision and I knew he saw\n&gt; the same, not to mentio=\r\nn I kind of felt bad that I had to do all of\n&gt; this to him at 11:30PM. I tr=\r\nuly didnt want to make his life a\n&gt; complete hell any more than it already =\r\nwas and he felt better that I\n&gt; had talked to him, so as a result I did as =\r\nwell. I then left and once\n&gt; again headed back home.\n&gt;\n&gt; Certain that I was=\r\n going to get good praises; I sat at the PC again\n&gt; only to immediately get=\r\n yelled at. They asked me why I was &quot;so good&quot;\n&gt; and that they had absolutel=\r\ny no respect for me. I tell them I just\n&gt; did all of that for them and they=\r\n say that I always do things &quot;the\n&gt; right way&quot; and they hate me for it. Thi=\r\ns is where I think I hit the\n&gt; loony bin and just didnt see how I was going=\r\n to fix this problem.\n&gt; Then it got worse and saw that my thoughts were now=\r\n being\n&gt; communicated back to me. Then I knew it and was convinced I was go=\r\ning\n&gt; skitzo and that i was just truly arguing with myself in reality,\n&gt; es=\r\npecially when I saw I wasn&#39;t even speaking. I used the restroom,\n&gt; splash w=\r\nater on my face and faintly start to hear the same mob people\n&gt; in my fan m=\r\notor in the bathroom. I haven&#39;t drank, done any drugs\n&gt; (even prescription)=\r\n and have a pretty complex job which I can still\n&gt; handle, but yet I feel l=\r\nike I am going crazy.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can&#39;t talk to anyone about it so I sit back at =\r\nthe CPU, only to\n&gt; hear that I need to open up the front door. Screw that!=\r\n=85I just\nlook\n&gt; out the window and see nothing and say no way. They ask wh=\r\ny not and\n&gt; that I should trust them and I say hell no and I continue to\n&gt; =\r\nhear &quot;God Damnit&quot; from them when they get mad. They continue to ask\n&gt; me to=\r\n open the door and I continue to check the window to see\n&gt; nothing. I say t=\r\no knock then and they get mad and say they have no\n&gt; hands. They don&#39;t soun=\r\nd like they are joking and get mad when I laugh\n&gt; even, so I continue to th=\r\nink I am just crazy at this point. I asked\n&gt; why they wanted to come in and=\r\n they said they wanted to fix me. I say\n&gt; there is nothing wrong with me an=\r\nd they say they hate me and want to\n&gt; eat me.\n&gt;\n&gt; I start to really think a=\r\nbout this and say ill open the door if I get\n&gt; the answers to all this. The=\r\ny start saying things and its if as\n&gt; though they see my thought process de=\r\nvelop and say things\nlike=85&quot;watch\n&gt; him go&quot;. Then I hear out of my compute=\r\nr monitor something I couldnt\n&gt; even fathom. I hear my ex-wife&#39;s ex-best fr=\r\niends voice. His name was\n&gt; Daniel and he had committed suicide over 5 year=\r\ns ago. I did know him,\n&gt; but not as well as she had. It WAS his voice and h=\r\ne said &quot;Charles its\n&gt; Daniel&quot; and then I heard their voice again say we are=\r\n &quot;down here with\n&gt; him&quot;. At this point I didnt know really what to think, b=\r\nut this part\n&gt; in our conversation was the turning point on my beliefs and =\r\nthoughts\n&gt; on what was really going on.\n&gt;\n&gt; I say nothing yet they somehow =\r\ncan seem to hear my thoughts and start\n&gt; saying little things to make me th=\r\nink even more. It was the most\n&gt; fluent conversation I had ever had. It was=\r\n truly telepathic and was\n&gt; on a level I could never really explain even to=\r\n myself. Then it\n&gt; really hit me and I said &quot;Demons&quot;. I tried to play somet=\r\nhing and got\n&gt; no response for the first time ever on the sound file. I the=\r\nn started\n&gt; piecing it all together from there and even though I wasn&#39;t a\n&gt;=\r\n believer this makes more sense then I could ever write down here and\n&gt; as =\r\na result I forever will be one now.\n&gt;\n&gt; They ask for me to now open the doo=\r\nr and I open the small glass door\n&gt; on my CPU desk and they get really piss=\r\ned off, saying I tricked them.\n&gt; Then their voice changed to the most demon=\r\nic, vile and disturbing\n&gt; voice I could ever put into words. I never really=\r\n thought of doing\n&gt; that until that moment and I think it was seen from the=\r\nm reaction,\n&gt; but it worked out quite nicely. I start saying the our father=\r\n prayer\n&gt; and I can hear the displeasure in them even more and heard &quot;that&#39;=\r\ns it\n&gt; we are going in&quot;. I immediately took off my headphones and ran to ge=\r\nt\n&gt; a bible they never did as far as I can tell, but I sat there all\n&gt; nigh=\r\nt with the bible in my hand praying.\n&gt;\n&gt; I started calling people and my ph=\r\none started cutting out, the bulb\n&gt; on the porch blew and my good friend&#39;s =\r\ngirlfriend called me to ask me\n&gt; for help because my friend was drunk and p=\r\nassed out. It sounded like\n&gt; she was trying to flirt with me and I asked he=\r\nr how &quot;A&quot; nightclub was\n&gt; and she said good and then I said didn&#39;t you actu=\r\nally go to &quot;B&quot;\n&gt; nightclub actually and she switches her story. I hang up a=\r\nnd call\n&gt; back with no answer. The time was only 1:10am and they never leav=\r\ne\n&gt; until the clubs close so this was even odder.\n&gt;\n&gt; I sat there terrified=\r\n most of the night praying, until I called my\n&gt; brother who told me that I =\r\nhave to stand up to them or I am feeding\n&gt; into their fear. He like my mom =\r\nhas been involved in similar things\n&gt; like this but after talking to both o=\r\nf them, neither have on this\n&gt; level. But in a refreshing breath after talk=\r\ning to them about this,\n&gt; they did seem to believe me. But it wasnt unil I =\r\nresearched this\n&gt; issue and found out about EVP and how it works, did I tru=\r\nly know that\n&gt; I wasnt becoming a lunatic.\n&gt;\n&gt; That brings me to today and =\r\nme being at my wits end. I swear on\n&gt; everything this is all 100% true and =\r\nI feel like I am crazy even\n&gt; still. Even though I hear it from no one else=\r\n and have a pretty good\n&gt; circle of friends, not to mention that I still se=\r\nem to do my job just\n&gt; fine as well. I havent put on my headphones or heard=\r\n any voices since\n&gt; I tried to last listen to the recording, which was now =\r\n3 days ago.\n&gt; Does anyone have any help and guidance here, as this all has =\r\nreally\n&gt; destroyed my life. I deleted all the copies of the recording, exce=\r\npt\n&gt; for one hardcopy. I still have the original recorder with the file\n&gt; o=\r\nn, but I haven&#39;t tried to use the recording or recorder any further,\n&gt; as I=\r\n refuse to continue it without any guidance. I figure its best to\n&gt; avoid t=\r\nhem, like my brother said. Maybe someone can help me\n&gt; understand all of th=\r\nis. Even if I have gotten rid of these things\n&gt; what does that say of B? I =\r\nreally spent a bunch of time making this\n&gt; really need some genuine help fr=\r\nom someone in the know. I know it\n&gt; sounds crazy but please regard this all=\r\n as true. I am new to this\n&gt; stuff and will just stay away from it now, but=\r\n some kind of insight\n&gt; would be great.\n&gt;\n\n\r\n--9-1743716020-0955961004=:4\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;FONT size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;I kind of figured that since th=\r\nis group was the first one that I ever talked to about my entrance into the=\r\n unexplained and EVP, I figured I would give an update. I will be the first=\r\n to contest that what you hear is something that&#39;s definitely there. After =\r\nI continued to get nothing but negative experiences during my EVP, I decide=\r\nd to just forget it. Well the things messing with me have not really agreed=\r\n with me on that. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Just last Friday, I went to a party of my friends=\r\n and I took a picture of something odd. This is a real picture folks and I =\r\nchallenge anyone to find a made up flaw in it. The first one circles the en=\r\ntities and the second one is just the original file. I know this doesn&#39;t pe=\r\nrtain much to the EVP realm, but it&#39;s a follow up from an experience of one=\r\n, which now proves the legitimacy off this field=85..pictures always speak =\r\na thousand words. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;I really would like to think that I am too stubbo=\r\nrn for anything even more serious to happen,&nbsp;as I am just considering =\r\nthem a nuisance now. I will be seeking a higher power either today or very =\r\nsoon. If you guys don&#39;t hear from me again, I just may be possessed=85.&lt;=\r\ngulps&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://i319.photobucket.com/albums/mm458/djdeta=\r\nle_photos/CircledParty_Pic-1.jpg&quot;&gt;Outlined Pic&lt;/A&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://i319.photobucket.com/albums/mm458/djdetale_photos/OriginalParty_Pic-=\r\n1.jpg&quot;&gt;Original Pic&lt;/A&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;-Chuck&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---=\r\n In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;chuck255&quot; &lt;chuck255@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; My name is Chuck and I stumbled upon this site and its information=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; while trying to figure out what&#39;s going on in my crazy life. Befo=\r\nre I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; get into that let me explain a bit about myself. I am a male =\r\nin his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 30&#39;s, who has Bachelors in Regional Development, with a min=\r\nor in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Computer Science. I work at a respective power plant company=\r\n within &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Arizona doing GIS Tech Work. I get drug tested at it on ra=\r\nndom &lt;BR&gt;&gt; occasion and I really only drink socially, or on some holiday=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; occasions. I have always been a logical kind of thinker my whole =\r\nlife &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and never really had any &quot;belief&quot; in the paranormal, even tho=\r\nugh my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mom and brother strongly do. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I feel so we=\r\nird even trying to explain this story because about a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; week ago I w=\r\nould have thought of it as silly. About a year ago I met &lt;BR&gt;&gt; someone e=\r\nlse, who for now ill call B. I fell madly in love with her &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and aft=\r\ner a short time I was more than happy to have her come and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; live wi=\r\nth me at my new place. In some strange way I always felt as if &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the=\r\nre was something about B I could never quite understand. After &lt;BR&gt;&gt; abo=\r\nut 3-4 months of living with her I started to get the inclination &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nthat B was cheating on me. Her stories never added up, her job was &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n secretive and she started stumbling on her words a lot. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nI then started getting spy gadgets, because she was staying with me &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; and I was concerned about my place along with her activities there. I &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; at first just got a digital recorder, but then after time I started &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; to get aggravated and felt that the digital recordings were just &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; being used to play and taunt me. So then I went to the extent of &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; getting Cameras and even Camcorders. Whenever I would ask about &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; something peculiar, I got tears and a really heartfelt reaction that &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; really made me believe her. I felt like we really loved one another =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and I could really see some care in her eyes, so most of the time =\r\nI &lt;BR&gt;&gt; just gave in to what she said as true, but didnt have enough to =\r\nstop &lt;BR&gt;&gt; looking. I felt like I had been in enough relationships to kn=\r\now the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; difference here. I have seen the act before and it really d=\r\nidn&#39;t look &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that way here, unless she was just really that good at =\r\nfooling &lt;BR&gt;&gt; people. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; During the course of our stay th=\r\nere she would pitch a huge fit if I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; had to leave her at the apartm=\r\nent alone and would stop at nothing to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; try and be in my company in=\r\nstead. But I started to get aggravated as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; time progressed and knew=\r\n something was up, because of the odd voices &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I would hear within t=\r\nhe recordings. I made her stay there will trying &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to sneak back and=\r\n see who was messing with her around my place. I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; lost it because I=\r\n couldn&#39;t pinpoint it at all and last July and got &lt;BR&gt;&gt; into a fight ri=\r\nght outside of my place with three other people. She &lt;BR&gt;&gt; always told m=\r\ne she talked to her self when I qestioned other voices &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and I never=\r\n could see anyone else there when she did, even with the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; cameras, =\r\nso I had no choice but to continue on believeing her still=85=85&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ev=\r\nen though my feelings wouldn&#39;t agree to her words. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; For so=\r\nme odd reason it just seemed as if she knew where the cameras &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and =\r\nrecorders were every time, just by the way she would exit and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ente=\r\nr the apartment. So then I started putting them outside and about &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\na month ago something crazy happened. I started listening to a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dig=\r\nital recording and at the beginning of it I flat out heard B &lt;BR&gt;&gt; cheat=\r\ning on me with someone. I was upset and happy at the same time &lt;BR&gt;&gt; tha=\r\nt I finally had caught it and as a result I sent her away. She &lt;BR&gt;&gt; lef=\r\nt town because all her family was in another city. She couldn&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;&gt; st=\r\nop crying and was hysterical, especially when she saw I was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; devast=\r\nated too. I thought that I had finally gotten my answers and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; she w=\r\nas just the best actress I had ever known, end of story. She &lt;BR&gt;&gt; tried=\r\n to kill herself a couple of times while this was going on a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; coupl=\r\ne months back. If it was as an act or not, I really just don&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;&gt; kno=\r\nw. But when she left last she left a note telling me not to let &lt;BR&gt;&gt; he=\r\nr die and she hopes that I find her soon before her heart stopped. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Me=85..I said more BS and threw the note in the garbage. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n A couple of day&#39;s later curiosity got the best of me and I started &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; listening to the rest of the recording. I then started to hear what &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; sounded like people monitoring ME and calling me a &quot;Threat&quot;. I &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n immediately start acting alarmed. Then in the recording I hear B exit &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; the apartment in disgust after I stormed off that night, as we were &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; fighting about something weird yet again. After I had left she &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; started talking about setting up a &quot;Private Meeting&quot; with some other &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; people and something about boating. Well during the beginning of thi=\r\ns &lt;BR&gt;&gt; meeting I heard a reference to a crazy accusation that I had mad=\r\ne at &lt;BR&gt;&gt; B awhile ago, which to me at the time confirmed she was in th=\r\ne Mafia. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; That explained all the weirdness to me and during this me=\r\neting the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; voices changed a bunch as if they sounded &quot;Masked&quot; or &quot;D=\r\nisguised&quot;, so &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I really had to amp up the volume. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n The next day and every day after from this point on I amped up the &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; volume in the recording. I also had to distinguish the masked voice &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; by breaking the large file into smaller segments of two to four &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; second intervals, in order to piece the entire recordings meaning &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; together. Over time I started to interpret the masked voices better &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; because I thought I was tuning my ears better to them. The voices in &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; these recordings were two different males, B and some other female. =\r\nI &lt;BR&gt;&gt; later on saw in the recording that they had actually seen the &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; recording but weren&#39;t taking it, which was EXTREMELY odd to me &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; considering they had been caught. Why not destroy the evidence? &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Then I heard one of the males say that he was the &quot;Boss of the &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Southwest Mafia&quot; and that I was going to pay for hurting B like thi=\r\ns. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He also said that my being a nuisance in the apartment had mess=\r\ned up &lt;BR&gt;&gt; his business within the area and all my spy stuff had really=\r\n pissed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; him off. He told me I was dead, my daughter along with me =\r\nand more &lt;BR&gt;&gt; than likely my whole family as well. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He=\r\n knew where my mom and dad lived and some information I didn&#39;t even &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; tell B. I freak out and figure the damn mob is after me. I keep &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nlistening and he says &quot;If I don&#39;t move away and discontinue my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; int=\r\neractions with my daughter by December 5th, that he would know &lt;BR&gt;&gt; tha=\r\nt I was just playing with B and then my whole family is dead&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thi=\r\ns was exactly one month from when I had used the recording device &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\ntoo by the way. I moved out and away from my daughter breaking the &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n tie and in tears the whole time too because I couldnt explain why. I &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; really did it because I feared for their lives of my family and felt &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; that we would all die if f I didnt. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Meanwhile B an=\r\nd met someone else that ill name J for now. After &lt;BR&gt;&gt; knowing him for =\r\ntwo days she decided to bring him back with her to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; pick up her thi=\r\nngs out of the apartment. I was kicking her out of it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; by the way. =\r\nI thought it was just to piss me off and I forgot about &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it. Then I=\r\n heard as I progressed in the recording J&#39;s name brought &lt;BR&gt;&gt; up. Suppo=\r\nsedly they knew him and he was in their mob and I needed to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; go att=\r\nack him to prove myself, or else B will never be seen from me &lt;BR&gt;&gt; agai=\r\nn. I also hear that I can&#39;t go to certain places at certain times &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nwhere B might be and furthermore think that they didnt take the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; re=\r\ncorder because the damn thing has to be planned down to the times I &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; would hear it. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; At this time I am in fear for my life an=\r\nd my families, lost my love &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and I am not understanding how the rec=\r\nording is so damn well time &lt;BR&gt;&gt; planned, figured im going crazy. Then =\r\nsomething ill never forget &lt;BR&gt;&gt; happens. I am spoken directly too and I=\r\n figure its me going of the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; deep end now. I try and test my sanity=\r\n and go to different parts of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the recording only to get the same t=\r\nhing kind of direct question. I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; am in disarray at this point! I st=\r\nand up and walk around, trying to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; figure out just what the hell is=\r\n going on with me. I get back on and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; further see that my verbal qu=\r\nestions are now being answered instantly &lt;BR&gt;&gt; by this recording (Which =\r\nis merely a sound file on the pc). *I was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; using Sound Forge by the=\r\n way if anyone wanted to know what sound &lt;BR&gt;&gt; software I was using was*=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have so little sleep at this point and I am told that =\r\nI need to do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; all this crazy stuff and drive out to the middle of s=\r\nome hotel right &lt;BR&gt;&gt; then and there, to further see them, as I have pas=\r\nsed all their tests &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to get into their mafia now. As a reward B wou=\r\nld be there waiting for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; me too. I hurry to do it and rush there bu=\r\nt no one is even their to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; answer the door. I go back and get a yel=\r\nling voice at me that I had &lt;BR&gt;&gt; left to early and immediatly go back. =\r\nMe not wanting to piss the mob &lt;BR&gt;&gt; boss anymore, I take the 45 minute =\r\ntrip again and go back. But when I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; get there it just didn&#39;t feel r=\r\night to me and I never exited the car, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; especially when I saw the n=\r\numbers in vehicles hadnt changed in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; parking lot. I had plenty =\r\nreason to be paranoid at this point and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; truly felt in danger.I lef=\r\nt and thought I was done for when I got &lt;BR&gt;&gt; back. Instead, he tells me=\r\n that he was impressed by my decision when &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and literally puts me i=\r\nn tears when he said that because of my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; intelligence, I had won my=\r\n families lives back, but not my own yet. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; All this is don=\r\ne by him also telling me that he can physically see me &lt;BR&gt;&gt; through his=\r\n advanced mafia technology on the computer monitor. He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; also tells =\r\nme to to move things around on my compter desk that were &lt;BR&gt;&gt; between t=\r\nhe sight of me and the computer monitor, while demanding I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; correct=\r\n my posture when speaking to him. He also states that he is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; watchi=\r\nng my every move and if I tell anyone anything they die along &lt;BR&gt;&gt; with=\r\n me. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I make no sense of this and I was completely baffled=\r\n on how I was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; being communicated with. I had just moved and there =\r\nwas no internet &lt;BR&gt;&gt; connection even. Me just being happy my family is =\r\nsafe, I decide to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; go to sleep. Feeling as though I am now sleep de=\r\nprived and going &lt;BR&gt;&gt; crazy from the stress, I go to sleep for two days=\r\n consistently, as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; this was during the Thanksgiving holiday time. I=\r\n would purposely make &lt;BR&gt;&gt; myself sleep longer when I woke to ensure I =\r\ndidn&#39;t belong in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; loony bin. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When I finally w=\r\noke up I was determined to find an explanation to how &lt;BR&gt;&gt; they were ta=\r\nlking to me, I go to the library and look into Bluetooth &lt;BR&gt;&gt; technolog=\r\ny, telephony, and remoting into a computer=85..anything. Then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I re=\r\nalize=85=85..that I can find out just how crazy I really am by moving &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; the recording and listening to it elsewhere. I then decide to take &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; the same recording into my work to test my saneness, along with the &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; file itself. If its was on my home CPU=85.then it&#39;s going to now be =\r\nat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; my work one too right? I do and get the same damn thing, not to=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mention that the &quot;Mob Boss&quot; now has company two others when I spe=\r\nak &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to him. All of them yelling at me for moving their sensive &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; information. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; During this time I invest in GPS, GSM, =\r\n3G and several signal blocking &lt;BR&gt;&gt; devices, in order to prohibit mysel=\r\nf from being tracked any further. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; They never worked or even phased=\r\n the &quot;Mob Boss&quot;. But I would still &lt;BR&gt;&gt; check the recording in the even=\r\ning just to hear what I needed to do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in order to be making them ha=\r\nppy and get the possibility to see B &lt;BR&gt;&gt; again. The &quot;Mob Boss&quot; had tol=\r\nd me that it was all just a test for me &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to see if I loved her and =\r\nshe never really did do anything. They &lt;BR&gt;&gt; continue to tell me over an=\r\nd over that I have to beat up J in order &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to prove myself to B. Tha=\r\nt this is what everyone is really waiting on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and if I would just g=\r\no up to the other town and get it over with, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; then I can bring her =\r\nback with me. I won&#39;t do it and say that I won&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fight for anythin=\r\ng that doesn&#39;t want to be fought for. Basically &lt;BR&gt;&gt; saying that B can =\r\ncall me about it if she really wants it. Then as a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; result they sta=\r\nrt threatening my family again. At this point, I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; really can&#39;t even=\r\n express to you how much of a wreck I am. But I felt &lt;BR&gt;&gt; like I needed=\r\n to be strong for my family and get on the mob&#39;s good &lt;BR&gt;&gt; side so I ca=\r\nn fix the mess I created.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Well it never really happened an=\r\nd this torment went on for a good &lt;BR&gt;&gt; week, while I was moving everyth=\r\ning I could as fast as I could in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; order to make their deadline and=\r\n save everyone. Everyday I would do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; what I thought was expected of=\r\n me and hope it wouldnt make them mad &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in one breath, while in the =\r\nother breath win back my complete &lt;BR&gt;&gt; freedom, away from their bad sid=\r\ne. No matter where I was or what I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; did during the day they usually=\r\n seemed to know about it when I talked &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to them in the evening. It =\r\nreally bothered me that I couldnt find out &lt;BR&gt;&gt; where they were putting=\r\n the &quot;bugs&quot;, or even better how they were &lt;BR&gt;&gt; doing all of it. My inab=\r\nility to &quot;believe&quot; in the paranormal really &lt;BR&gt;&gt; hurt me here.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Since the apartment that B and I had used was empty at this time a=\r\nnd &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a friend of mine was down on his luck, I gave him the apartment=\r\n for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; free until the lease was completely up. After about a week of=\r\n me &lt;BR&gt;&gt; doing this, I walked in and found guns and ammo everywhere and=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; freaked the hell out. That&#39;s the last thing I needed when I thoug=\r\nht &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the mob was just down the street! I made everyone there except =\r\nmy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; friend leave, with quite a fuss I might add. Then I headed back=\r\n to my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; home to see how the mob felt about what I did, assure they =\r\nwould be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; impressed that I had looked out for them. Instead the reg=\r\nular female &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that was always with the &quot;Mob Boss&quot; now asked me why I=\r\n didn&#39;t finish &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the job, stating that there was still someone there=\r\n and it made them &lt;BR&gt;&gt; all angry. They demanded that I go back especial=\r\nly to see just how &quot;I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; finished it&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; So like the =\r\npuppet I was at that time, I went back. I didn&#39;t have the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; heart to=\r\n put him on the street, even though he had put me at a major &lt;BR&gt;&gt; risk =\r\nand instead I just found another place for him to stay. On the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; way=\r\n there I bought him some water and some smokes. When we got there &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nI even helped him move in and explained that it wasn&#39;t me that did &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n it, but the leasing office had saw all the guns. As a result they had &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; made me do it. I thought he made a poor decision and I knew he saw &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; the same, not to mention I kind of felt bad that I had to do all of &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; this to him at 11:30PM. I truly didnt want to make his life a &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; complete hell any more than it already was and he felt better that I &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; had talked to him, so as a result I did as well. I then left and onc=\r\ne &lt;BR&gt;&gt; again headed back home. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Certain that I was goi=\r\nng to get good praises; I sat at the PC again &lt;BR&gt;&gt; only to immediately =\r\nget yelled at. They asked me why I was &quot;so good&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and that they had=\r\n absolutely no respect for me. I tell them I just &lt;BR&gt;&gt; did all of that =\r\nfor them and they say that I always do things &quot;the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; right way&quot; and =\r\nthey hate me for it. This is where I think I hit the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; loony bin and=\r\n just didnt see how I was going to fix this problem. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Then it got w=\r\norse and saw that my thoughts were now being &lt;BR&gt;&gt; communicated back to =\r\nme. Then I knew it and was convinced I was going &lt;BR&gt;&gt; skitzo and that i=\r\n was just truly arguing with myself in reality, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; especially when I =\r\nsaw I wasn&#39;t even speaking. I used the restroom, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; splash water on m=\r\ny face and faintly start to hear the same mob people &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in my fan mot=\r\nor in the bathroom. I haven&#39;t drank, done any drugs &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (even prescrip=\r\ntion) and have a pretty complex job which I can still &lt;BR&gt;&gt; handle, but =\r\nyet I feel like I am going crazy. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I can&#39;t talk to anyone =\r\nabout it so I sit back at the CPU, only to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; hear that I need to ope=\r\nn up the front door. Screw that!=85I just look &lt;BR&gt;&gt; out the window and =\r\nsee nothing and say no way. They ask why not and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that I should tru=\r\nst them and I say hell no and I continue to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; hear &quot;God Damnit&quot; from=\r\n them when they get mad. They continue to ask &lt;BR&gt;&gt; me to open the door =\r\nand I continue to check the window to see &lt;BR&gt;&gt; nothing. I say to knock =\r\nthen and they get mad and say they have no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; hands. They don&#39;t sound=\r\n like they are joking and get mad when I laugh &lt;BR&gt;&gt; even, so I continue=\r\n to think I am just crazy at this point. I asked &lt;BR&gt;&gt; why they wanted t=\r\no come in and they said they wanted to fix me. I say &lt;BR&gt;&gt; there is noth=\r\ning wrong with me and they say they hate me and want to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; eat me.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I start to really think about this and say ill open the door=\r\n if I get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the answers to all this. They start saying things and it=\r\ns if as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; though they see my thought process develop and say things =\r\nlike=85&quot;watch &lt;BR&gt;&gt; him go&quot;. Then I hear out of my computer monitor some=\r\nthing I couldnt &lt;BR&gt;&gt; even fathom. I hear my ex-wife&#39;s ex-best friends v=\r\noice. His name was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Daniel and he had committed suicide over 5 year=\r\ns ago. I did know him, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; but not as well as she had. It WAS his voic=\r\ne and he said &quot;Charles its &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Daniel&quot; and then I heard their voice ag=\r\nain say we are &quot;down here with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; him&quot;. At this point I didnt know re=\r\nally what to think, but this part &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in our conversation was the turn=\r\ning point on my beliefs and thoughts &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on what was really going on. =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I say nothing yet they somehow can seem to hear my though=\r\nts and start &lt;BR&gt;&gt; saying little things to make me think even more. It w=\r\nas the most &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fluent conversation I had ever had. It was truly telep=\r\nathic and was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on a level I could never really explain even to myse=\r\nlf. Then it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; really hit me and I said &quot;Demons&quot;. I tried to play som=\r\nething and got &lt;BR&gt;&gt; no response for the first time ever on the sound fi=\r\nle. I then started &lt;BR&gt;&gt; piecing it all together from there and even tho=\r\nugh I wasn&#39;t a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; believer this makes more sense then I could ever wr=\r\nite down here and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; as a result I forever will be one now. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; They ask for me to now open the door and I open the small glass do=\r\nor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on my CPU desk and they get really pissed off, saying I tricked=\r\n them. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Then their voice changed to the most demonic, vile and dist=\r\nurbing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; voice I could ever put into words. I never really thought o=\r\nf doing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that until that moment and I think it was seen from them r=\r\neaction, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; but it worked out quite nicely. I start saying the our fa=\r\nther prayer &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and I can hear the displeasure in them even more and h=\r\neard &quot;that&#39;s it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; we are going in&quot;. I immediately took off my headph=\r\nones and ran to get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a bible they never did as far as I can tell, b=\r\nut I sat there all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; night with the bible in my hand praying. &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I started calling people and my phone started cutting out, the =\r\nbulb &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on the porch blew and my good friend&#39;s girlfriend called me t=\r\no ask me &lt;BR&gt;&gt; for help because my friend was drunk and passed out. It s=\r\nounded like &lt;BR&gt;&gt; she was trying to flirt with me and I asked her how &quot;A=\r\n&quot; nightclub was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and she said good and then I said didn&#39;t you actua=\r\nlly go to &quot;B&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; nightclub actually and she switches her story. I han=\r\ng up and call &lt;BR&gt;&gt; back with no answer. The time was only 1:10am and th=\r\ney never leave &lt;BR&gt;&gt; until the clubs close so this was even odder. &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I sat there terrified most of the night praying, until I calle=\r\nd my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; brother who told me that I have to stand up to them or I am f=\r\needing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; into their fear. He like my mom has been involved in simila=\r\nr things &lt;BR&gt;&gt; like this but after talking to both of them, neither have=\r\n on this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; level. But in a refreshing breath after talking to them a=\r\nbout this, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; they did seem to believe me. But it wasnt unil I resear=\r\nched this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; issue and found out about EVP and how it works, did I tr=\r\nuly know that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I wasnt becoming a lunatic.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; That br=\r\nings me to today and me being at my wits end. I swear on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; everythin=\r\ng this is all 100% true and I feel like I am crazy even &lt;BR&gt;&gt; still. Eve=\r\nn though I hear it from no one else and have a pretty good &lt;BR&gt;&gt; circle =\r\nof friends, not to mention that I still seem to do my job just &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fin=\r\ne as well. I havent put on my headphones or heard any voices since &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n I tried to last listen to the recording, which was now 3 days ago. &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Does anyone have any help and guidance here, as this all has really &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; destroyed my life. I deleted all the copies of the recording, except &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; for one hardcopy. I still have the original recorder with the file &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; on, but I haven&#39;t tried to use the recording or recorder any furthe=\r\nr, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; as I refuse to continue it without any guidance. I figure its b=\r\nest to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; avoid them, like my brother said. Maybe someone can help me=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; understand all of this. Even if I have gotten rid of these things=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; what does that say of B? I really spent a bunch of time making th=\r\nis &lt;BR&gt;&gt; really need some genuine help from someone in the know. I know =\r\nit &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sounds crazy but please regard this all as true. I am new to th=\r\nis &lt;BR&gt;&gt; stuff and will just stay away from it now, but some kind of ins=\r\night &lt;BR&gt;&gt; would be great.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n\r\n--9-1743716020-0955961004=:4--"}
