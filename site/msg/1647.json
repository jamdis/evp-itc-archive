I&#39;m a practicing Paranormal \nPsychologist/Investigator in New Orleans \n&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ghosthuntersneworleans/&gt;. I noted the \ncontroversy concerning the ITC devise on a couple of other groups \ninspiring my joining this one. I&#39;ve read through the sites&#39; communiques \nand am still in the dark as to how the machine works. I know that most \nof the fault lies in the fact that I am totally lost when it comes to \nelectronics; theory, construction and use. I am, however, most \nfascinated with what I have read and the obvious possibilites which are \npresented. I am very anxious to learn all I am able to about the \ninstrument and have the opportunity to acquire one by whatever manner \nit takes. So, my question at the moment is: How do I acquire one??? I \nwould be exteremely appreciative of any assisstance offered. Thank you \nin advance.    --Rod"}
