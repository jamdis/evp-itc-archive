If we are talking about people with a \nreasonable degree of critical thinking and mental stability, then you have my full buy-in \non that concept.  \n\nHowever, it&#39;s my opinion there are *plenty* of people out there who should never touch a \nbox of any flavor with a 10-foot pole, and having people who are mentally and/or \nemotionally unstable and who lack critical thinking, just mucks up the works and makes \nthe rest of us look bad.  \n\nie:  People who believe and promote the idea that a &quot;murderous reptilian race&quot; is \ncommunicating through the DR60.  Yeah, you know...  I really don&#39;t want to be put in the \nsame category with them, just because I own a DR60.  But rest assured, I got an email one \ntime from someone assuming that of me, letting me know that she was a believer too!  \nOMG!!!!!  \n\nMargaret   \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; No bodies at fault, but I would do the hack just to help more people get in this field.

If people are willing to pay, you \ncan&#39;t \n&gt; fault the person selling for taking advantage of what the market will bear. Perhaps the \n&gt; people who do not have the tools, or the skills, to do their own hack, feel this price is \n&gt; reasonable?\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://cgi.ebay.com/Ghost-Box-Radio-EVP-Paranormal-State-Franks-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \nbox_W0QQitemZ200212582012QQihZ010QQcategoryZ155297QQssPageNameZWDVWQQ\n&gt; &gt; rdZ1QQcmdZViewItem\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here is the Ebay ad bids up to $51.00\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ghost Box Radio EVP Paranormal State Franks box Telephone to other \n&gt; &gt; side Haunted radio Paranormal State\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kay\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Marlboro63@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stefan,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This guy who sells on Ebay does get 55.00 a unit for them.
