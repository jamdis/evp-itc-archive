<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Why 2 groups... because the 2 descriptions of each group are so  
radically different. In my own experience with the one group, and what  
other spirits have told me about them, I tend to think, there are 2  
groups.

The group that Sandra talks about is very helpful, but she doesn&#x27;t  
have enough info. on her site for me to actually examine the group she  
dealt with. Mr. Smith (AAEVP) refers to them as demons. I&#x27;m not sure  
I&#x27;d go that far, but yeah, ok - my experience was fairly nasty. Was  
that because they are so called &quot;demons&quot; which I think is a ridiculous  
term btw, or just immature, yet very clever spirits who get a kick out  
of causing trouble - or trying to? I just don&#x27;t know.

 From hearing both descriptions, I&#x27;d say there may be 2 groups or  
maybe only one &quot;real&quot; Fish Group and another band of roving nasty  
spiritual beasties who want you to think they&#x27;re the Fish Group to  
give them an &quot;in&quot; to talk to you - invade your world so to speak.

If they said they were a band of crazy demons, would you talk to them?  
lol! :D
But if they said they&#x27;re the Fish Group, I&#x27;d be like OH! Ok, let&#x27;s see  
what they say...

&gt; Don&#x27;t you think it&#x27;s more likely that they&#x27;re both? I always try to

&gt; full of anarchists, loyal neither to black or white? Most everything  
&gt; in this world falls into the area of gray. I think it&#x27;s therefore  
&gt; likely that this is true of the next.
