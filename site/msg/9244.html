      Hello Margaret,
   
  Thanks so much for the replies.  (You replied to my previous email and I forgot to thank you. )
   
  The first EVP that I received was a fellow saying "Peace". Before I do an EVP session I always say a prayer and use the quote used in Mark Macy's book which basically says that I would like to communicate with others who would like to see others move closer to God in thought, word, and deed. I always add that I would like to communicate with those that come in Light, Love and Peace. He has said "Peace" twice now. LOL.
   
  I have my sweet wife listen to all of them also. The second EVP that I got was when I asked if there were any Spirits present. A woman, who sounded like she was in the living room said "No, no Spirits." Then you could hear her walking on our hardwood floors with hard soled shoes. I figured maybe she didn't know she was a Spirit. 
   
  The laugh wasn't sinister. It just caught me off of guard. I have a Jack Russell Terrier, Molly, and I was playing with her, so it's possible that the young girl was giggling at Molly or as you said maybe because she was on the tape. During this EVP Molly was just a staring at the right of us. I am sure she saw them. 
   
  Thanks for the input. I deeply appreciate it. 
   
  Many Blessings All,
   
  Jeremy

    Hi Jeremy. Congrats on such great EVP's!! It hasn't happened often, but I have heard 
laughing on both my own recordings, and that of others, but nothing there was nothing 
sinister sounding. And one time, I heard what sound like a kiss.

If the giggle sound was that of a young girl, maybe she was just tickled to be talking on 
the recorder? If you think about it, it's very common for children to laugh and be silly 
while in the physical. Makes sense they would do that in spirit as well. :-)

Again, congrats on getting clear messages so quickly. At some point, you'll want to make 
sure others can hear some of them too. It's not uncommon for something to be heard 
absolutely clearly by the person doing the recording but not heard clearly (or even heard 
at all) by others. I never really know how clear what I have might be until I get feedback 
from others. It's my opinion that doing EVP work can definitely increase one's 
clairaudience. 

Margaret
