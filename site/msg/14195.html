You can actually tell if the bytes themselves are different? If so, that wo=

        If the audio had been resampled, you could expect less byt=
es, or different bytes, but not the same number of the same bytes.  That's =
why comparing the bytes in both files can rule that out, if no changes are =

                  They are not necessarily the same =
bytes, but I was proposing a quick check just to see if the files were in t=
he same ballpark.  Look at it the other way: if the number of bytes were DI=
FFERENT, than you'd know the files HAD changed, and you could stop testing.=
  But if the number of bytes are the same, it tends to indicate the files a=
re likely the same, but you still need a low level file comparison to be su=
re.

                  My method is to compare the files using the CMP comm=
and in unix.  There are many programs to compare files, but you have to be =
careful not to use one that does a line-by-line compare (or a comparison me=
ant for text files), since text files can be different at a low level, but =
look essential the same in an editor (because of the way spaces and tabs an=
d new lines work between editors and platforms).

                  But any=
way, the way to compare is with a program that can compare binary files, no=
t text files.

  A file's content, it's integrity, is simply the bytes (and their bits) in=
 the file.  If the file's content integrity is changed, that is, by definit=

integrity has not changed.

                            It is possible to m=

When you do your tests, if you cannot do a bit level comparison, I would re=

a very high probability that the content has not changed.

h file each came from, there would be no way to tell.  Even the audio playe=
r could not tell.  The data is identical, and so the sound (or the picture,=
 etc) would be identical.

                                Yes I did listen=
 to the results, but that is not the best test (they sounded identical, but=
 that is a subjective opinion).  The real test is compring the contents.  I=

        For executables, you may be right. However, for wav files, the comp=

used to think as you do, in that the emailed attachment of a wav file would=

                                The kind of compression that occurs during=
 an email attachment is "lossless": it compress the file cleverly without l=

 I sent it over email, it could compress it.  But if it lost even one bit, =
the resulting exe file would not execute again after it was uncompressed on=
 the other side.

                                This kind of compression =
does things like looking for common patterns in the file, and replacing the=
m with a token.  A rough example would be if it found "Howdy Neighbor" in a=

on it can be uncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are replaced with "Ho=
wdy Neighbor".  So it was compressed (instead of 14 characters each, it onl=

 Another thing:

                                I recently found this out.=
 When you email a file, if it is not saved as a compressed format, the emai=
l filtering process will actually compress the file automatically.

       =
                         So even if you have attached a wav. file, it will =
loose resolution over the email process. It will not sound exactly the same=
 as the original wav. file. How much it differs depends on the size of the =
file you are attaching. If it is a very large file, it will sound much diff=
erent.

                                The only exception to this is if th=
e wav. file is small enough that the filtering process will ignore it. It h=
as to be pretty small though, like under 1 MB (I am not exactly sure of the=
 threshold).

                                The best way to share files o=

                             I always save the whole file in wav format the=
n do my clips as mp3. Then I have the original for analysis. 

            =
                    As far as pixelization of non sounds/white noise whos t=
o say that isnt being manipulated by them as well LOL. Water is a form of w=
hite noise. I seem to remember some experiments done with blank tapes/film,=
 no recording done yet there were voices/images there. I find it all intere=
sting.

                                Just a thought. Ok off to work now!=

                                Be a bit careful of =
formats like mp3 if you are doing a detailed analysis of the sounds though.=
   While some formats (like wav) can store the audio very close to the way =
it was recorded, formats like mp3 compress the file, and in so doing lose s=
ome of the sonic details.  This may not be a big deal in music, where the a=
udio is fairly clear to begin with.  But with sound sources with a lot of n=
oise (like evps), this can not only obscure any real sounds, but pixelize n=
on-sounds (like white noise) and make them start to sound like speech.

   =
                             So mp3 might be good for sharing the data, onc=
e you've already formed an opinion based on an analysis of the wav file.  B=
ut mp3 is not good as a medium for analysis.  It can lead to many false pos=
itives and misinterpretations.
