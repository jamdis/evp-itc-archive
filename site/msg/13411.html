I agree, Larry! (and I am a psychic, lol)

I did not watch the show becaus=
e my group and I were actually out investigating  something last night. As =
it is we are very busy with cases, box research and other research and proj=
ects. We do not, therefore, have time to watch other people,often pathetic =
wanna-be famous para-celebs, pretend to be what we really are.

 

I wrote =
a blog about this whole thing - in this field, thos that can do..those that=
 can't sit and watch others pretend to do ti on TV.

I find most paranormal shows have become BS an=
d I don't watch any. Its all the same "dog and pony" act. Since "Ghost Hunt=
ers" has become a hit "everyone" wants their own tv show or radio show. Its=
 all "look at me".

                 Sorry I'm very jaded on tv paranormal =
investigators,mediums and evangelists on Sunday mornings. In my book they a=
ll rank just a bit above lawyers but still below pro wrestling.

  (Hows th=
at for an introduction?  :)  )

=
I have to admit that I thought I had seen the worst 'paranormal' show on te=
levision already. I was wrong. Door to the Dead has exceeded my worst expec=
tations.

 

Generally, I respect John Oliver's work as a medium. While I h=
ave no personal experience with him, in the past he has looked and acted mo=
re genuine than not, the rolling of the eyes put aside for the moment.

 

=
I do take exception to the characterization of the talking box as an Edison=
 device. I have documented the history of Edison, ITC and EVP  [http://www.=
sdparanormal.com/EdisonWhitePaper.html] elsewhere. This is however the smal=
lest concern I have with this show.

 

Prior to wathcing I had just had a =
conversation with a respected colleague on the West coast regarding interes=
ting phenomena he and others are constantly observing in sites with phenome=
na similar to that on Door to the Dead. None of those measurements were mad=
e by this team. The use of thermal in this situation is not indicated as we=
ll.

 

The real concern is that no attempt was made to help this family in=
 a broader context. The skeptic did and said nothing skeptical as far as I =
could tell. Key questions were not asked (at least on-camera) that would re=
veal the psycho-dynamics of this family. We know fairly well at this time t=
hat PK phenomena is often centered on a focal person who can exhibit specif=
ic characteristics. That the team seems unaware of this is quite disturbing=
 to a person like myself.

 

A real research opportunity was lost in this =
case, as was an opportunity to educate the public on the right way to appro=
ach such situations. Continually sending the messages that phenomena is bas=
ed on 'demons' and 'spirits' exclusively does nothing to further the positi=
on of serious investigators, which is perhaps most troubling of all.
