<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My husband and I both got sick with the same bug this year (same specific symptoms), and that&#x27;s rare... but I&#x27;m not too worried about the latest &quot;superbug&quot;, that&#x27;s what they seem to be saying all the time ever since I started watching the news as a child (90s), it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re always trying to sensationalize.... I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s funny anymore...  kids especially don&#x27;t think the news is funny.... I remember when I was maybe like ten and they had a short blurb at the end of the news about possible asteriod... I was so freaked out my mom had to fill a bowl with water take an egg out of the fridge, and slide it down the bowl into the water, and say that if it hits, that&#x27;s what will happen to it, it will simply slide into the ocean... and I bought it too... lol!
