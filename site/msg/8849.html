 This is with the ext antenna wire added, and echo box. I also switched to=
 a smaller monitor speaker. I think a woman at the end says "Frank--Frank-I=
s Sister Kiera ".  In the beginning-something aobut doing video-followed by=
 something about Katrina--again! 
 
 I was going to put this in a metal cab=
inet, but realized that would kill the AM reception, so I was trying the wi=
re antenna, it helps, but not enough when the main antenna is shielded insi=
de a metal box! BTW, I also added a wire for FM, it comes off the inner con=
ductor of the headphone jack. 
 
 I get grumpy with this stuff sometimes, b=
ut it's so intiguing to me, I end up staying up for several nights at a tim=
e to work on it.
