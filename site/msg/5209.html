Theres some great software out there. Problem is the really good ones have big price tags. Id have to use them before I could comment on them. Clear Voice Denoiser works pretty well for me and what I do. Ive been using it almost from the start along with the p1 filter for all my water sessions. It's become part of my standard practice. The p1 helps bring the voices out without destroying the other noise.. or it can destroy most of the noise, its up to you and your settings. Clear voice free demo works on all clips under 30 seconds which is fine for most evp work. I liked the program enough I bought it to support thier work. 
   
  Heres one from last night, may hear her maybe not. LOL but at least ya can see the before and after results of filtered or unfiltered and how CV raises the voice level. It works especially well for the -74 speed voices, gives them a giant boost in tone levels. Not so whispery.
   
  This one is just normal speed, as recorded.

            Bruce's test with unlabeled messages brings up a question I have about howEVP-ITC@ yahoogroups.com to better decipher what is being said on the other side (particularly for those of us who can't hear too well).  Is there a computer Voice Recognition system that can be used.
   
  On this subject, I recently saw a video on  AOL about a secret sentence that actor Bill Murray mumbled at the very end of a movie...don't recall the name of the movie.  Technicians somehow processed the sound to make the message VERY clear and precise.  Even I could understand the sentence.   In the program you could hear the stepped improvements of the signal till it was stepped up to the point of clarity.  Would that be possible or even useful for EVPs??  If so, how could I do that?????   Ron L
