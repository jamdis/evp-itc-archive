I&#39;m very impressed with the responses/answers I am being given. \n\nI received a greeting, by name.  \nConfirmation when I asked if I&#39;d heard correctly.\nAn object on my desk was correctly identified.\nAn object in my left hand was correctly identified (with a unique interpretation of it!)\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Margaret%20Downey/SJ%20Allophones/\n\nI hope you can hear some of these.  I&#39;ve been working to gather examples which show \nrelevance and intent of communication.  Arthur is on a roll.  LOL.  ;0)"}
