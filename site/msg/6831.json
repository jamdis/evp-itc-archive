From what I have seen of the show, and it has only be=\r\nen  (2) 30 \nminute episodes, it looked all staged.  And when the second epi=\r\nsode  was done I sat \nthere laughing my ass off at the results.  They didn&#39;=\r\nt  address the issues \ncorrectly and handle it anywhere near how it should =\r\nof been  done.  I guess \naccording to A & E that if we are talking to the s=\r\npirit  of the dead then WE are \nthe problem and should stop it or atleast t=\r\nhat is how  they addressed it.  Or \nis just how I see it?  But they do have=\r\n a lot  of nice toys to play with, I \nwill give them that.  I think I would=\r\n much  rather watch a made-for-tv \ndocumentary on the haunted piano than wa=\r\ntch another  episode of Paranormal \nStates........LOL\n \nJeff\n \n \nIn a messa=\r\nge dated 2/5/2008 1:39:58 P.M.
