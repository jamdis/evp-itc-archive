This actually fits with Christian beliefs too.  Everywhere the word
 Satan =
is used, they are talking about an agent of God who's purpose
is to tempt u=
s and therefore to temper our spirits and make us
stronger.

Yes, we're on the same page regarding a=

a conversation on another discussion group, intere=

Frank doesn't like a lot of religious discussion here):

"A pe=
rfect example (which I believe I mentioned before) is Satan, 
which was a H=
ebrew word appropriated by the Church under the context 
of "the devil" him=
self or "lucifer". In Judaism it refers to 
god's "angel" that's translated=
 as the "adversary" - it stands 
for "choice". A "prosecutor" if you will, =
he gives you choice - to 
which there is an outcome - i.e. a consequence. W=
ithout something to 
choose against, there'd be no "free will", hence "Sata=
n" or "ha-
Satan" was created. There's nothing inherently negative about th=
at, 
other than the ominous notion to choose wisely.  All 
energy, "good", =
"bad", all comes from the same source in 
Jewish/Kabbalistic belief. "Angel=
s", "demons", etc. are not
considered to have free will (that's what we wer=
e created for), and
are seen as simply direct extensions of the same "one" =
(hence the main
angels have "el" - alpeh lamed - as part of their name). It=

via the concept of a pure monotheism viewpoint. All are simply
