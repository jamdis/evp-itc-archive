The 469 validated EVPs that I have captured in my\napartment. the name given was the same as on the EVP when I asked who\nwas here.\n\nYou are a wealth of information.

I&#39;ve hacked the radio, but do not\n&gt; have a port into my sound card. Any suggestions of different\n&gt; configurations that have worked well for you. I&#39;m in Atlanta so we\n&gt; have a lot of stations and I&#39;m getting what seems like a lot of one\n&gt; station or another when it scans. Do you find it necessary to mix the\n&gt; raw audio with white noise?\n&gt;"}
