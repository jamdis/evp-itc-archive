Yes, if they&#x27;re not code-protected.  Anyone have one they&#x27;d like to 
volunteer?

&gt; What about copying it from one of the chips?

&gt; The chip is a microcontroller. It needs a program called &quot;firmware&quot; put into it before it will do anything useful. The chips have a program memory which comes blank when you buy them.The &quot;code&quot; is the representation of what is called machine language that tells the various parts of the microcontroller what to do. In this case, I imagine it increases a voltage with a certain pattern and then drops it down to zero, starting over again and repeating at a certain rate. This would produce a repetitive sweep of the radio at a certain rate when the microcontroller is hooked up to the radio correctly.It wouldn&#x27;t be difficult for me to write my own program to do this with a PIC microcontroller, but if someone else has already done it, why bother?If I can&#x27;t get my hands on the machine code, I&#x27;ll write some myself.ZackOn Fri, 4 Jan 2008, mllejade wrote:&gt; Frank, please let me know if you should, for whatever reason, decide&gt; to sell that chip (to control the scan rate of the &#x27;469). I&#x27;d like&gt; to purchase it from you, if possible.&gt;&gt; Thanks,&gt;&gt; Sharon&gt;&gt; P.S. I&#x27;ve read the follow-ups to my initial question and being a&gt; layman at modifying electric apparatuses, what do you all mean by&gt; code? Does one need the code and the chip in order to speed up the&gt; scanning on a hacked &#x27;469; or can one do it with simply a code, or&gt; the chip, alone?&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, the guy that first made the hack was giving away a chip to&gt; control the scan rate. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still available. I have&gt; one of the chips, and no &#x27;469.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Frank-S&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: leongbabe@...: Thu, 3 Jan 2008 16:37:00&gt; +0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Any way to speed up the scanning on the 12-&gt; 469?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m still relatively new to building boxes and would like to know&gt; if it&#x27;s possible to speed up the scanning a bit on a hacked RS 12-&gt; 469. Thanks,Sharon --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption&gt; &lt;franks-boxes@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks for listening. Yeah, that&#x27;s the&gt; problem with noise reduction methods, they tend to take out voices. I&gt; think if I used the muffled sound consistently they would talk&gt; through it though, the goal being to get higher level voices, and&gt; audio. The clarifier is just a low pass filter that can be adjusted--&gt; just an idea.&gt; I have some female guides that speak sometimes, and&gt; there&#x27;s the seven sisters that come though sometimes, but I don&#x27;t&gt; know much about that. &gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@: debbie@: Wed, 2&gt; Jan 2008 10:33:33 -0700Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] The &#x27;470 mod?&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Frank, Thanks for the extra instructions, it doesn&#x27;t sound too&gt; difficult for me so I&#x27;ll give it a shot. &gt; &gt; By the way, I did listen&gt; to your tone control clip. Since I&#x27;m new to this my comments are&gt; probably not &quot;worth&quot; much at this point. I thought the entire clip&gt; itself was a lot smoother and clearer than most I&#x27;ve heard so far&gt; from various sources (the mixed station sounds are in smaller pieces&gt; so for someone like me it would be easier to pick out the EVPs as&gt; opposed to entire words from radio announcers). The short piece about&gt; 2/3 of the way through, where I&#x27;m guessing you used a clarifier,&gt; sounded muffled to me, which makes me think it would also muffle the&gt; EVPs. Definitely easier on the ears but for someone inexperienced&gt; (and I seem to be the only one here!) it seems it would be harder to&gt; pick out the real words too.&gt; &gt; By the way, in listening to the&gt; deluge of clips uploaded last night, I can&#x27;t help but notice that the&gt; voices are all men. Just curious -- is that always the case?&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&gt; &gt; Debbie Tejada&gt; &gt; &quot;Once you can accept&gt; the universe as matter expanding into nothing that is something,&gt; wearing stripes with plaid comes easy. &quot; ~Albert Einstein&gt; &gt; On Jan&gt; 2, 2008, at 10:22 AM, Frank Sumption wrote:&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have&gt; the &#x27;470, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the older one or not.

You have to lift the&gt; top board so you can see the wire connections on the other board,&gt; they are labeled, and you can tell what wire to cut/unsolder. (mute&gt; wire).
