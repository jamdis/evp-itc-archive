Modern researchers in this field will\nhave to stand on their own results anyway, and if they&#39;ve managed to\ndiscover something that Edison never achieved, good for them!\n\nI have also heard varied claims: that Edison did make this box; that\nEdison was working on it but never finished it; that Edison was joking\nwhen he mentioned working on it.  So for my own sake, I&#39;d like to know\nthe real story.\n\nIf you have a link to where you got your information from his\nassistants and staff, I would really like to read it.  Please make\nsure it is as close to the source material as possible, and not\nsomeone quoting someone quoting an article.  For example, here is a\nlink to the actual New York times article on Edison discussing his\nviews of life after death:  \nhttp://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9903EEDC1F39E333A25751C0A9669D946196D6CF\n\nThat is the kind of link I&#39;d be hoping for regarding your statements.\n\nThanks for any info.\n\nRj\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;threadsintyme@...&quot;\n&lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; When Moon starts to walk on water, change water to whine, heals the\nsick and and lame and balances our national budget is when I will\nbelieve this type of hype!! \n&gt; &quot;John is joined in his mission by Chris Moon, an expert in all\nthings paranormal and possessor of Thomas Edison&#39;s mysterious\n`telephone to the dead&#39;&quot; \n&gt; The only problem with this hype is that there is no and probably was\nnever a telephone to the dead.
