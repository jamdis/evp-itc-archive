Robin, you are very welcome, and thanks for the kind words.  I may just have a temporary solution to your reception problem.  I was experiencing the same thing living in the country.  I was literally hangout my bathroom window trying to get a good signal, getting completely little or no reception.  I came up with an idea to take my camcorder input and output cord, put it into the top of the box and run it through the TV.  The TV acts as an antenna allowing a for a temporary fix to be able to conduct sessions at home.  Just put the channel on like your going to be watch a DVD and it should come right through for you.
   
  In addition, Joel also ran a ground with a number #12 copper wire under my sink to the box.  (I know you should see my kitchen, I'm just waiting for the FBI to come think I'm making bombs with my boxes, lol).  It totally increased my reception 10 times over.  I also have a copper rod (#12) looped in my window.  I know this sounds crazy, but I will do just about anything for good communication.
   
  I am sure that there are also some of the guys who have assembled makeshift antenna's as well.  Frank S. sent Joel the wish list for one some time back, and I will see if I can find it.  He is a wealth of knowledge and comes up with ideas to help us get to where we need to be.
   
  Lastly, your officially been inducted into the crazy world of box communication.  As far as your family, they will come around, (I'm on my 3rd husband because of the paranormal) and if they don't you can always trade them in, lol.  They learn to adapt to our world, and just remember, Everyone else who observes you "are just jealous cause we hear voices" (a shirt I wear proudly)!!!
   
  Best of Luck!
  Juli

ACK! I have no radio reception! I'm out in the boonies and my house 
backs right up to a tree-covered hill. I'm going to have to find 
another private place to do my research.

I had to tag along on errands with hubby and son this afternoon and 
brought my RS 470 and digital recorder with me for the ride. You 
shoulda seen their reactions when I started asking the radio 
questions in the car! My son said I was scaring him (geez, he's 19), 
and my husband said I was like one of the bag ladies we see walking 
down the street talking to herself. They're both disappointed in me 
for not having a more acceptable hobby like knitting. I stayed in 
the car recording when they went into the store, and then I noticed 
there was this woman in the car next to me who had been staring at me 
open-mouthed for God knows how long. I haven't uploaded the 
recording to the computer yet, but really don't think I got anything 
besides radio fragment.

Speaking of that, the scan rate seems pretty fast, and yet the 
stations each hold for several seconds, so I get more like complete 
sentences than broadcast "fragments." 

Do you think some people are chosen to be researchers in this field? 
I guess I'm feeling a little discouraged right now, but I'll figure 
this out soon. 

Robin
