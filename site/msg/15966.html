I was listening to Steve Hultay's RTSC radio show on that they did on
sept=
ember 6th and they were talking about the mini box. They said that
for some=
 reason they have to let it run for a while before they get any
messages. T=
his then brought up a point on whether or not the spirits
have to get used =
to the radios before they are able to speak. So it may
be easier to announc=
e that you are doing a session and which radio you
are using. I think exper=
imenting is key and you just have to figure out
what works for you and your=
 box.

If you're interested in Steve's show, you can find it here

I find =
that spirits speak in bursts of energy and if I record for long
periods of =
time I get very little but if I record for a short period of
time they make=
 much better use of that time. Also it is much easier to
analyze short reco=

Being out on investigations one might choose to record there longe=
r as
you document your investigation but for straight evp work i usually do=

between 30 seconds and 3 minutes and no longer. They use the time
wisely. =
And the voices are much louder. When doing the group or circle
such as with=
 a medium they also have been loud as we were but again its
much more energ=
y in the room when doing those things.
