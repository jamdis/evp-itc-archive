<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Most of the AM radios I&#x27;ve seen with analog tuning have padding
trimmer capacitors on the sides of the air variables. It&#x27;s really
tricky to get varactors to gang-tune both at the same time. You&#x27;d need
to put trimmers in parallel with the varactors and then try to get
them to track.

Some of the air variables also have the last set of plates on one end
cut with slots so separate sections of the capacitor are bent to
further fine-tune the tracking. So the air variables may not even
change at the same rate.This is difficult to do with varactors.

It could probably be done but I wonder if it&#x27;s worth your time.

Good luck!
