Thx Steve
I should have known that you or Mike or one of you other smart gu=
ys would have already
been there and thought about that......better late th=
an never though.
As soon as I can find time I will send some of the EVP's I=
 have gotten from my Steve's box #4
so you guys can hear them......
Got ano=
ther question: My friend Selina has a Steve's box ( can't remember which # =
it is right now Steve)
Selina said that her box works better for me than it=
 does for her....
Why would her box and my box work better for me than Seli=
na,  she is more sensitive to the paranormal than
I am? Both of the boxes a=
sk for me...... It's so strange.....
What do you think?
