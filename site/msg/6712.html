<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, i have seen the demonic first hand and have used the boxes 
only at home for personal research.  So, i have used it in your 
fashion up to this point.  I have also noticed that the Spirits on FM 
are very mean and curse a lot and AM does not.  Can you explain that 
one ???   Technicians if offered to a box user i feel should only be 
used to get the communication up and running and than only call on 
them when you are having problems....hence &quot;Technician&quot;----People who 
fix things.

&gt;  I have noticed a disturbing trend of box users to develop what 
&gt; appears to be an ego based &quot;mission&quot; that seems to coincide with 
&gt; these supposed technicains. You would think, since I make the boxes 
I 
&gt; would get some assistence from the supopsoed technicains, but there 
&gt; is none! 
&gt; 
&gt;  I do not know who or what communicates. I am unwilling to jump on 
&gt; the higher spirit band wagon, as they seemly produce nothing 
useful, 
&gt; very little verifiable information, nothing that makes life better, 
&gt; nothing that helps me make better boxes. I know only that something 
&gt; talks that shouldn&#x27;t be there, and that keeps me intrigued. As Sun 
&gt; Bear used to say, &quot;They don&#x27;t grow any corn&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt;  I have a &quot;group&quot; that insists I am their Space Princess, now how 
&gt; wise is it to just accept what they say, without question, being 
that 
&gt; I am niether female, nor Royalty!
&gt; 
&gt;  Curious that I make the boxes, but my input about it&#x27;s use is so 
&gt; easily dismissed.
&gt; 
&gt;  There is at the very least, multiple levels that can be contacted, 
&gt; some very manipulative, perhaps demonic if you want to go down that 
&gt; road. If you want them to tell you how great you are, they will 
&gt; certainly do so, that is why the caution.

&gt; &gt; Hi Frank, 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; When you mention being distrustful of what comes through the 
boxes, 
&gt; are you saying you&#x27;re skeptical of the &quot;technicians&quot; being who they 
&gt; say they are?  Not trying to open another can of worms here, just 
&gt; wanting to continue learning from your experience and research.  I 
&gt; get what you&#x27;re saying about becoming obsessive with the sessions.  
&gt; I&#x27;ve probably asked you this a half dozen times over the last 
couple 
&gt; of years, but who or what do YOU think you&#x27;re/we&#x27;re  communicating 
&gt; with?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;   Have ya tried EVPmaker? It is based on that random principle, 
and 
&gt; &gt;   predates the boxes.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   I&#x27;ve heard this stuff before, about random being the best, and 
I 
&gt; &gt;   have to disaggree. I also think it unwise to spend every waking 
&gt; &gt;   moment doing sessions. I think it creates that expectation, and 
&gt; &gt;   perhaps desperation to make contact, and I would tend not to 
&gt; trust 
&gt; &gt;   what comes through. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   I don&#x27;t trust some of this stuff because I have yet get any 
&gt; &gt;   meaningful assistence with the boxes from the so called 
&gt; technicians. 
&gt; &gt;   All I ever got was a telepathic &quot;suggestion&quot; to use the echo 
&gt; boxes. 
&gt; &gt;   Everything else was a assemblage of stuff I had worked on in 
hte 
&gt; past 
&gt; &gt;   to solve the problem of &quot;what else could I use&quot;. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   I hate to see yet another go down the road of &quot;this is the 
&gt; onlyest 
&gt; &gt;   way&quot;.
