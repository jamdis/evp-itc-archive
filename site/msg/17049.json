I have not written much but have visaully followed this group\n&gt; over the past year. I have much experience in the realm of the paranormal.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is the issue. Our home has an inhabitant that we cannot seem to\n&gt; remove. It does not speak to us on the frank&#39;s box nor will it communicate\n&gt; through either me or my partner, Jay. We are both mediums. It slams and\n&gt; bangs in the house almost ceaselessly at night. It hits the walls, windows,\n&gt; the tv, the bedside tables and the doors. I am at a loss as to how to\n&gt; otherwise communicate because as I said with the 2 boxes we have, it won&#39;t\n&gt; speak.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am open to any and all suggestions. We have told it to go, tried many\n&gt; different suggested rituals and to no avail. It will go quiet for a day to\n&gt; three days after ritual work but begins again, only louder.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please, if anyone can help or direct us to someone who can I would be most\n&gt; grateful.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; Annie & Jay C.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nHa e you conside ed ha i may jus be ene gy, and no a sen ien being?I sounds like a ypical pol e geis case.On F i, Ap 23, 2010 a 4:47 PM, Azu e D azu edamsel ly@...> w o e:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÂ \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n I am Annie.
