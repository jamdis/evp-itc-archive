  Sorry Frank,

  It's just the way you worded your statement. made it s=
eem like she was of no value. That's okay. I am certain that I read a bit m=
ore into what you wrote. Sorry! 

  I suspect that she may not have a lot g=
oing on in her life at the moment. Things are really tough up here in Michi=
gan. We have the worst economy in the US. There are also other reasons, I a=
m sure. But we may have all that she had going, you know. 

  Would like to=
 add, God Bless her and all that she does.
