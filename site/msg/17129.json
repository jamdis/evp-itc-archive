I have been involved in paranormal stuff since I was a kid, my sister and I used to see things and interact with them, got into paganism, paranormal, being open minded etc and moved up the ladder. My sister is more into the religious part of paganism etc I just see myself as eclectic, not really religious. Ghosts have always fascinated me, and after hearing about the Ovilus and Frank&#39;s box decided to try some stuff myself . Unfortunately I can&#39;t hack a radio to save my life, we don&#39;t have Radio shack here and I destroyed the radio I tried it on, lol. But I have used cross over talk and gotten some good results. I posted them on youtube, I need to figure out how to make them mp3 format to post here.\n\nI have a question ( and I hope I am not asking what someone else has asked already) but the way the radio waves work with speaking to the dead, could tv white noise to the same? I&#39;m not expecting results like the Poltergeist movie, lol but I am just wondering if it is at all possible since it&#39;s still broadcasting signals."}
