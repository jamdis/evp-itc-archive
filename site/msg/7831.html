<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You should call Juli (who&#x27;s on here).  She has all sorts of spookies

&gt; my daughter and i were making a video of us goofing around. this is a 
&gt; 15 second video and we were laughing loudly. but towards the end of 
the 
&gt; 15 seconds there we hear an unknown male voice saying &quot;say something&quot; 
&gt; we thought it was my brother&#x27;s voice maybe perhaps coming through my 
&gt; video but then it really didnt sound truly like my brother. sounded 
&gt; more like a male voice. now what the heck was that????????? this is 
the 
&gt; first time this has ever happened. we are still spooked about this.
