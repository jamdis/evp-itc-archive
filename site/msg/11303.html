 Busy-busy-busy! I found the RS arm band radio works the best, the 469 is a POS, mess with it too much and it quits working. I have one with bad AM, and another with F'd-Up FM. I found this Sony at the thrift store of $6.99, don't know if it's usable yet, but it's better than $35 for the RS. Anoither Honda radio, this one is only a maybe at this point. 
 
 Techno question; I see people making banks of RS 12-469s, and I can only ask why!?  Some seem to have the technical expertise to build the sweep circuit, why not just make a simple box that's proven to work? I wouldn't use that multi-radio set up, it'd be impossible to understand anything from it.  It would seem more cost effective to start wit something that works. 
 
 The 12-470 can use an external sweep voltage, but you have to locate the converter stage that turns the digital pulses into a voltge the varactor can use. It takes the 8 volts (max) for AM, but FM is weird, it tunes form +4 to 8 volts. I have newer car tuners like this as well.
