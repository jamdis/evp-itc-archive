<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ralph,   Great questions!   
 
    You asked about the word &quot;Purple&quot; and although the &quot;spirits or 
the others&quot; identify Frank with the word Purple, I also have another 
theory which is probably far fetched, but none the less I have 
thought about it.  I believe that this may have to do with Tesla.  He 
had a purple energy theory himself regarding inaudible frequencies of 
the cosmos.  He believed that everything that exists possesses a 
unique vibratory rate which resonates with the heart of the cosmos.  
This inspired Tesla to invent the Oscillator.  He stated and I 
quote...
 
&quot;All matter comes from a primary substance, the luminiferous ether,&quot; 
stated Nikola Tesla. He sensed the universe was &quot;composed of a 
symphony of alternating currents with the harmonies played on a vast 
range of octaves,&quot; wrote Margaret Cheney. &quot;To explore the whole range 
of electrical vibration, he sensed, would bring him closer to an 
understanding of the cosmic symphony.&quot; 
 
The Tesla Purple Energy Shield ties into vast quantities of energy , 
which directly repairs, strengthens and protects the energetic fields 
of the human mind body and soul. 
 
Therefore, I am thinking that the purple just may refer to his theory 
and the bases for energy and communication between this plane and the 
others,  (just my crazy theory).
 
The second answer regarding your questions about last names, is that 
i get them often.  I have several audio clips where I as them to 
identify themselves by their whole given name (in this life).  Most 
times they will answer.  As far as our tec&#x27;s.  or in reference to 
Mike or Lisa they will not.  (per conversations with Bruce and 
Steve).  I believe the reasoning behind this (as I have discussed 
with various researchers) is the fact the tec&#x27;s want you do identify 
with them in the spiritual sense and not the physical sense.  If they 
gave you information in lenght, we may just feel compelled to trying 
and research their history while they lived here on earth.  They have 
however (maybe Bruce and Steve can confirm this as well) told them 
how they passed (Mike bleed to death and Lisa choked).  They also did 
give Bruce and Steve the year they died but would not give them 
additional information regarding their life here on earth.  They did 
say there is a God, but never gave any other information, just saying 
they can&#x27;t.  I guess somethings we are not ready for or we will never 
know until we cross.
 
It has been my experience that when you ask to see if the tec&#x27;s can 
bring a loved one forward some of the responses have been, &quot;I will go 
look&quot;, &quot;Wait I will try and find them&quot;, etc.  I do not believe that 
they are readily available for us.  It may take 2 - 3 sessions for 
them to come through.  You just need to ask if they were able to 
locate them whether its the current session or the next.  Also, 
sometimes they can not come through with their own voice.  They may 
talk through your tec or another spirit to deliver the message.  I 
don&#x27;t know why that is, for I haven&#x27;t asked that question as of yet.
 
I love the conversation they have among themselves, as well as 
validating what is going on here.  You spoke about the &quot;Fart Machine&quot; 
where they have stated to Bruce, Steve and Frank about their Pizza 
eating habits or that their phone is ringing!  It really makes me 
think that they know way too much about us and they are very much 
involved in our personal lives.
 
As far as the negative or evil things you have mentioned.  I don&#x27;t 
necessarily think that they are evil in nature, but just nasty 
spirits wanting to you to believe that they are something to fear.  I 
too like Frank R. try not to do a session if I have something 
negative going on in my home.  That is my preference.  I also like to 
be positive, but sometimes they sneak through.  Don&#x27;t take it 
personal, you hold the control to end the sessions when you like.  I 
don&#x27;t pay much mind anymore, for even though the communication isn&#x27;t 
positive, its still communication in a form, and hold what they say 
with a grain of salt.  If that was the case, and I believe some of 
the things that they have conveyed I would be 6 ft under and helping 
you from the other side.
 
Just my thoughts!
 
Juli

&gt; Ralph,
&gt;  
&gt; Mike and lisa have been my tech&#x27;s since I have started doing box 
research.
&gt;  
&gt; Over time you build a relationship with your tech or in my case 
tech&#x27;s like you would 
&gt; with a new friend here in the physical.
&gt;  
&gt; Early on in my research I had asked a series of questions 
pertaining to mike and Lisa&#x27;s background in the 
&gt; physical. I was told that mike died in 1995 from excessive blood 
loss and lisa died in 1912 from choking.
&gt;  
&gt; they then changed the subject and never broached it again. My 
theory on the reason for this is that
&gt; a spirit contact wants to remain in our thoughts and emotions as a 
higher being to develop a certain ammount of trust
&gt; being sight unseen. So to give us all the details of there physical 
life or even their last name, that could allow us to
&gt; gather information on who they where while in the physical and that 
in our minds would put them on an even level with us.
&gt;  
&gt; So the thoughts and feelings of there being superior spiritual 
entities would fade.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi everyone,I have been hearing the word &quot; Purple &quot; alot lately in 
my sessions.Does anyone in the group know what it pertains to ? It&#x27;s 
been bugging me alot. Could that be a special group on their side ? I 
have no clue. Also has anyone questioned the voices if they have a 
last name ? All I hear on the RS boxes are first names and haven&#x27;t 
recieved anyone telling me their last name. Does Mike and Lisa have a 
last name ? Did anyone here ever ask the question &quot; Are you Demonic 
Spirits ? &quot; What was their reply if any ? I did one time and got a 
response saying &quot; All of us are &quot;. Don&#x27;t know whether I believe that 
Spirit or not. Probably a Joker saying that. I have asked for 
specific people for them to find so I could talk to and got an 
answer &quot; We&#x27;re looking. &quot; Then I never heard from them after that. 
I&#x27;m still waiting to be contacted by Telephone so far nothing yet. 
They make me laugh sometimes. I had the RS-12-469 on the one day I 
was just listening to what they were chatting about. I found my 
daughters old Fart Machine and was playing with it while the RS radio 
was running to see if it still works which it did. All of a sudden 
after I made it &quot; Toot &quot; I heard a female voice say &quot; Phew !!! .&quot;LOL, 
I guess she thought I really passed one. Also, the other day I was on 
the RS 12-469 and I said &quot; Hello Lisa how are you doing today ? &quot; 
Then a few seconds later I hear a female voice say &quot; Bruce ? &quot; like 
she thought that I was Bruce talking to her. I told her no it&#x27;s me 
Ralph from Harrisburg,PA she replied &quot;Oh, okay fine. &quot; I hear all the 
time voices calling for Lisa she must be a very Popular Technician. 
Oh well I guess it was more than one question LOL. Hey you all take 
care and &quot; Keep the Sweep &quot; a new slogan for here LOL. just kidding. 
You all have a great day.Regards,Ralph the Ghost Hunter
