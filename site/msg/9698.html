<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That makes PERFECT sense, Kay.  

LOL - I sometimes like to take my Voice 2000s DA300 recorder in the car with me.  I don&#x27;t 
sweep in the car, but I do have a CD that I burned with Portuguese crowd babble on it, 
which I have played in the car and gotten interesting results.  Though there is something 
about that recorder and my car (a Prius) which is odd, all on it&#x27;s own... even without 
background.  ;-)

&gt; Thanks Margaret
&gt; 
&gt; I like to use a portable recorder so don&#x27;t have to be chained to the 
&gt; computer to record a session also I live in an area where I don&#x27;t 
&gt; always get good reception so I like to try different areas of my house 
&gt; and its easier to move a recorder around then my computer!!
