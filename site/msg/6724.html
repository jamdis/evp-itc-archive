<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Steve,
I will not get into another debate, your right I don&#x27;t know what you 
have been as of late. My comment was based on the many sessions we 
had done together in the past. I respect your right to do your 
research however you see fit, but remember I knew you when ! So lets 
end this thread right here.

&gt; Bruce,
&gt; 
&gt; I haven&#x27;t asked for mike and lisa in quite a while because i felt 
it 
&gt; was silly doing that.  Maybe crutch was a poor choice of words on 
my 
&gt; part, but we all have opinions and so far no one is right. 
Remember, 
&gt; we both have the same techs??  So, i figured to turn it on and ask 
&gt; who wants to speak with me and give others a chance to speak.  Mike 
&gt; and Lisa still come through every session in their same voice just 
to 
&gt; let me know they are there if i need them.  Besides i feel that 
they 
&gt; must be busy getting loaned out to everybody.  My communication has 
&gt; escalated to a better level recently and i know we have worked 
&gt; together in the past, but we haven&#x27;t in about a month and a half so 
&gt; don&#x27;t tell others on here how i do box sessions.  You really don&#x27;t 
&gt; know what i&#x27;m doing and would only give new researchers bad 
&gt; information.  Although we should all work together at this, we all 
&gt; have different methods and that&#x27;s what keep us tuned in to this 
&gt; message board every day.  Bruce, this is not an argument from me at 
&gt; all and i do respect what you do.  We just do things very 
differently 
&gt; now and that&#x27;s why we no longer do research together, but a 
different 
&gt; point of view is also good sometimes.

&gt; &gt; Robin,
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; I agree with Steve on a couple of points. First let me say that I
&gt; &gt; do believe that we all have a &quot;technician/guide/guardian&quot; call 
them 
&gt; what you
&gt; &gt; may. but I usually call them by the names they introduced 
&gt; themselves by.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; I know for a fact through many, many, many box sessions that when 
I 
&gt; turn
&gt; &gt; a box on, could be Frank&#x27;s box or the minibox or the RS 470 does 
&gt; not matter which.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; The same two entities will come through immediately, So much so 
&gt; now, that I do not even ask for conformation that
&gt; &gt; it is in fact them. I recognise their individual voice patterns. 
I 
&gt; have built a solid relationship with these two spirits
&gt; &gt; I know as mike and Lisa so much so that I have even gotten to 
know 
&gt; their individual personalities.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; There are other newer researchers here that will attest to the 
fact 
&gt; that when they where doing their first sessions
&gt; &gt; I had asked my two &quot;Friends&quot; Mike and Lisa to assist in getting 
&gt; them started and invariably the spirits that came 
&gt; &gt; through to these new researchers during their first sessions 
&gt; identified themselves as Mike and Lisa.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Steve says he does not turn on his box and use them as a crutch, 
&gt; that is not entirely true. I had done research 
&gt; &gt; very closely with Steve until recently and I would venture to say 
&gt; that 99% if not every session he starts with &quot;Mike &amp; Lisa
&gt; &gt; are you available to talk with me&quot; 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Also I don&#x27;t consider working with my technicians as using them 
as 
&gt; a crutch, They would not allow that.
&gt; &gt; They are not there like butlers at our beckoned call when we feel 
&gt; they may be of some use.
&gt; &gt; Quite the opposite, without them we would get no communication at 
&gt; all, they are allowing us the honor of receiving this 
&gt; &gt; celestial communication. They are the moderators, facilitators 
and 
&gt; generators of all we hear and send to and from the spirit realm.
&gt; &gt; And they also stand as guards and protectors to do the best they 
&gt; can to keep us from being deceived or taken down a dark path.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Some here wait for others to state an opinion and then tend to 
&gt; agree with that opinion no matter what they have experienced to be 
&gt; true.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Robin, my advice to you as a new researcher in this field. Form 
&gt; your own beliefs through your experience and research.
&gt; &gt; Listen and learn from others but do not let what you believe to 
be 
&gt; true or not, be swayed by popular opinion.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Steve,
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; I certainly appreciate your thoughts.  In the back of my mind is 
&gt; always the question of whether we are being Deceived.  Just for the 
&gt; sake of argument, is it POSSIBLE we&#x27;re being manipulated by 
something 
&gt; evil?  I&#x27;m not frightened, and I won&#x27;t stop my own research (the 
&gt; negative stuff just makes me more determined), but my mind does go 
&gt; there sometimes.  I hope that along with developing my &quot;ear&quot; I can 
&gt; acquire the gift of discernment.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; Robin,If i may add my thoughts on this: There is no concrete 
&gt; evidence of who or what comes through is what they say they are. 
&gt; Technicians i have found were used to get you up and running and i 
&gt; only now call on them if i need assistance. I don&#x27;t turn the boxes 
on 
&gt; and ask for them like a crutch, i conduct my session and if i need 
&gt; help they will supply it to me if needed. I think the whole idea is 
&gt; to find out who we are communicating with, maybe we will never 
really 
&gt; know for sure but i still try and find out as best as i can. -Steve

saying

&gt; &gt; &gt; Have ya tried EVPmaker? It is based on that random principle, 
and 
&gt; &gt; predates the boxes.&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve heard this stuff before, about random 
&gt; being the best, and I &gt; have to disaggree. I also think it unwise 
to 
&gt; spend every waking &gt; moment doing sessions. I think it creates that 
&gt; expectation, and &gt; perhaps desperation to make contact, and I would 
&gt; tend not to trust &gt; what comes through. &gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t trust some of 
&gt; this stuff because I have yet get any &gt; meaningful assistence with 
&gt; the boxes from the so called technicians. &gt; All I ever got was a 
&gt; telepathic &quot;suggestion&quot; to use the echo boxes. &gt; Everything else 
was 
&gt; a assemblage of stuff I had worked on in hte past &gt; to solve the 
&gt; problem of &quot;what else could I use&quot;. &gt; &gt; I hate to see yet another 
go 
&gt; down the road of &quot;this is the onlyest &gt; way&quot;. &gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt;
