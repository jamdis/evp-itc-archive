My link is www.ITCdeadpeople.com\n\nI saw your VPI work.  The images were very cool.  I don&#39;t have photoshop, although I did \ntake note of your process somewhere in case I ever get it.  I saw it on another person&#39;s site \nas well, so I never was sure if you had copied that person&#39;s technique, or they had copied \nyours.  All I remember thinking is, boy, that&#39;s a whole lot of steps to go through to get to \nthe final impressive images, and I wondered what made whichever one of you came up \nwith it, think to try all those steps.  \n\nI do remember that cat!  As well as some other really clear images.  :-)\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret,\n&gt; \n&gt; Before I became engrossed in box research I had done tons of research \n&gt; with every method of ITC imaging.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did Video Loop, water reflection, crystal, mirror, you name it.\n&gt; And got pretty good results from most.\n&gt; \n&gt; My most astounding visual itc came from a dicovery in my home.\n&gt; I have a crystal window in the front door of my house facing west, \n&gt; when the sun starts to go down it shines through this crystal window \n&gt; and projects onto the walls in my family room.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was sitting watching tv one day and happenned to look over at \n&gt; something that caught my attention, when I looked over there was a \n&gt; face looking back. I ran to get my digital camera and that started a \n&gt; year long process of experiments and spirit images I name VPI (visual \n&gt; projection imaging) I have literally hundreds of detailed images of \n&gt; spirits that where reflected through the crystal onto the walls in my \n&gt; home. as far as I can discern the spirits were forming the images \n&gt; inside of the crystal window, and the sun was acting as sort of a \n&gt; slide or movie projecter. Projecting their images onto the walls when \n&gt; it came through the window.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had a page on I am haunted for the longest time, and drew quite a \n&gt; following for my images. Alas since I discovered box research I have \n&gt; not done one imaging session.\n&gt; \n&gt; What got my attention was the mention of the horse image. I also \n&gt; captured the image of a horse, very detailed and a cat that you would \n&gt; think was sitting right in the room.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maragaret, please post the link to your site I did not get it and I \n&gt; would love to take a look.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone is interested let me know and I&#39;ll post some of my images.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;"}
