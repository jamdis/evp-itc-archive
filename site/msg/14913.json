I went on to research every ev=\r\np pioneer i could, listen to hours/days of recordings and it changed my out=\r\nlook on life. tears were turned to smiles and then I realised what all this=\r\n research is for. it was a big step for me spiritually. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I dont know if there is anyone else on here using old fashioned =\r\nmethods but if anybody would like to hear recordings please ask. I am using=\r\n a reel to reel sony &quot;Hi frequency&quot; recorder and trying various types of to=\r\nnes, backgrounds e.t.c.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Good luck to everyone =\r\nwith their research, you are right we are changing history we are discoveri=\r\nng new things. if it wasnt for individuals such as raudive, jurghenson to n=\r\name a few, maybe we wouldnt have discovered this. it takes a brave individu=\r\nal to tackle an arrogant human race blunted with science.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Kind Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The quiet one :-)&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, n=\r\new york, times, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; BORDER-LEFT: #10=\r\n10ff 2px solid; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n face=3DTahoma size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;F=\r\nONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &quot;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:SnowfireL@...&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:SnowfireL@...&quot;&gt;SnowfireL=\r\n@aol. com&lt;/A&gt;&quot; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:SnowfireL@...&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:SnowfireL@...&quot;&gt;SnowfireL@aol. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;ma=\r\nilto:RTSC@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto=\r\n:RTSC@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;RTSC@yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;; &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:inside_=\r\nthe_box_rtsc_talk_radio@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow yma=\r\nilto=3D&quot;mailto:inside_the_box_rtsc_talk_radio@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;inside_the_b=\r\nox_ rtsc_talk_ radio@yahoogroup s.com&lt;/A&gt;; &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoog=\r\nroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogr=\r\noups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;/A&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dh5&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Thursday, 4 June, =\r\n2009 20:25:26&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [=\r\nEVP-ITC] Re: [RTSC] a copy of my final e-mail to Frank sumption I will go n=\r\no further!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dh5&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT color=3D#0000ff&gt;Sorry to hear this Bruce, I&nbsp;sure hope things get bet=\r\nter, &nbsp;I had no idea there were so many problems when I joined all thes=\r\ne lists, &nbsp;I think you are all great people, you folks together are mak=\r\ning history don&#39;t you all realize this?&nbsp; There are so many people out =\r\nthere that have never heard of this type of communication, thousands out th=\r\nere!&nbsp; My friend just lost her mother a couple of weeks ago, when I tol=\r\nd her about the work you all are doing, tears were replaced with a smile, s=\r\nhe is looking forward to hearing from her mom now too.&nbsp; Stop trying to=\r\n hurt each other, it&#39;s not worth it, life is too short for this stuff.&nbsp=\r\n; You are all great people, May God Bless You All&nbsp;~ And He Already Has=\r\n,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff&gt;sf&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRON=\r\nG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In a message dated 6/4/2009 2:27:06 P=\r\n.M.

I have made the same challenge to your friend moon who w=\r\ne all know is behind this tirade he has time and again refused or\n ignored =\r\nthe request for any type of audio file&lt;BR&gt;to be publicly posted for revue a=\r\nnd continues to take advantage of innocent unsuspecting people with his con=\r\n game and charging large amounts of money for sessions where he fabricates =\r\nand makes up content as he goes along.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I was the only one to confron=\r\nt him in public and expose him for the fake he is and this is his feeble at=\r\ntempt at retaliation. I and other researchers like me have brought this res=\r\nearch light years from where it was when you and I first met, moon just con=\r\ntinues to use it to rip people off and has not contributed a thing to the r=\r\nesearch of ghost box communication beside lining his own pockets. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;J=\r\nust the fact that he has you doing his dirty work shows the type of guy he =\r\nis. I can remember a time when you publicly came out against any type of mo=\r\nney making using your boxes and even refused moon when he wanted to manufac=\r\nture and sell them for large profits yet now you condone\n his robbery of in=\r\nnocent unaware people and actually act foolish on his behest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Frank =\r\nyou are better than this, just concentrate on developing a better box and f=\r\norget about moon and his tricks and lies, he is finished in the paranormal =\r\nand he knows it, everyone is wise to his game and he is practically an outc=\r\nast.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Frank you are hitching you wagon to a dead horse. Get away from=\r\n these bad influences before they ruin your reputation as well.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We h=\r\nave had this moon discussion in the past and once he has exhausted his need=\r\n for you he will screw you again like he has done so many times before.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Frank, I like and respect you and I hope you will consider what I have =\r\nsaid in this e-mail and I sincerely hope you post this one on the evp-itc g=\r\nroup. I will be posting it on my group and others I belong to.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Your =\r\nformer friend&lt;BR&gt;Bruce&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;FONT:=\r\n 10pt arial, san-serif; COLOR: black&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HR&gt;\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://pr.atwola.com=\r\n/promoclk/100126575x1221354145x1201369495/aol?redir=3Dhttp:%2F%2Fad.doublec=\r\nlick.net%2Fclk%3B215221161%3B37268813%3By&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;L=\r\nimited Time Offers: Save big on popular laptops at Dell&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P=\r\n&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: white&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dh5&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: whit=\r\ne&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-1628744542-1244218440=:92027--"}
