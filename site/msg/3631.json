We&#39;ve recently become much more \nfocused in gathering audio recordings at such places. Please click \nthe link below, listen to the EVPs, and tell me if you agree with our \ninterpretations...\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.filecrunch.com/user/orbhunterx&quot;&gt;Sinbad! Sinbad! \nCome here precious... BARK!&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI understand why some keep things under wraps, and I certainly \nrespect that approach, too. That said, my take on paranormal \ninvestigation with DAPS is to openly share exactly what we&#39;re \ndocumenting on our investigations. \n\nIn that regard, it&#39;s my pleasure to post a link to my best of images, \ntaken on our investigations -\n\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.picturetrail.com/orbhunterx&quot;&gt;DAPS Imagery&lt;/a&gt;\n   \nPeace,\nLance\nDAPS"}
