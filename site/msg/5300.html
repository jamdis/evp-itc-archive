<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was bored on my day off today and picked up a radio and figured out 
the hack for it.  It took me maybe 5 minutes or less.  It has AM/FM and 
Shortwave.  It also has a built in speaker and it was $39, so anyone 
that is having trouble finding the old style 12-469 and 12-470 here is 
another model that is readily accessible.  E-mail me privately for 
details, i have to run at the moment and can&#x27;t get into the hack.  But 
i will post the specifics when i get home.  I&#x27;m actually proud of 
myself for figuring it out and not breaking it in the process.

-Steve H.</pre>
