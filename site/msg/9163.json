About one year ago I was trying to track down Frank S and his magic ghost box.  Took me months to find this forum Frank and all that comes with it.   But understand this, had I found the RS Hack and the language they are using on ebay one year ago, that would have been a Great deal at $100.00 or whatever.   AND if I would have seen some form of design plan with explanation on how to hack an RS radio on ebay, I would have done that before buying the radio.  This is the free market country, I like the idea of posting or advertising on ebay the hack info at cost.  Let people on ebay decide what to buy, (another) BUT don&#39;t do it with negativity or malice...do it in service to others.  Get the word out on ebay with a tag about this forum as well.

I would now like \n&gt; to render my opinion as to the subject of what we or anyone can do \n&gt; about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; My suggestion is DO NOTHING! Now before everybody&#39;s jaw hits the \n&gt; floor, hear me out.\n&gt; \n&gt; A couple of months ago I would have been the one to lead the charge \n&gt; in the assault on this guy in the name of box justice.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can now say with confidence, That is not the way to handle it.\n&gt; Let me explain why I believe this way. Without going into a lot of \n&gt; detail, I was a tough street kid that grew up on the streets of \n&gt; Brooklyn, I also served my country proudly for six years as a us army \n&gt; green beret, then to a career as a FDNY Fireman whose heart and \n&gt; health where both broken at 911.\n&gt; \n&gt; My point is, I have always lived my life believing that anything I \n&gt; did not agree with or that did not fit my sense of right and wrong\n&gt; whether it be right or wrong, could be easily solved with aggression \n&gt; of some kind.\n&gt; \n&gt; It took a long while and much sole searching and a lot of \n&gt; communication interpretation from our friends on the other side.\n&gt; But I have come to learn that aggressive action in any form is \n&gt; detrimental to the harmony and peace of the whole involved.\n&gt; \n&gt; Guy&#39;s like this guy on ebay do not and can not last in the face of \n&gt; good and well intentioned people that are here and willing and trying \n&gt; to get the word of this miraculous research and spirit communication \n&gt; out to as many people as are in need or want of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; That is how we can stop people like this bottom feeder. By spreading \n&gt; the knowledge of this research from one person to the next. Our \n&gt; friends have stated time and time again that any negative energy will \n&gt; be detrimental to the communication and the research, and positive \n&gt; harmony and vibration will serve to strengthen the bridge between our \n&gt; worlds.\n&gt; \n&gt; So even if you are not religious and do not believe in Jesus Christ \n&gt; as I do, these words ring true no matter what context they come from\n&gt; this wisdom was spoken by my lord two thousand years ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;do not check the splinter in your brothers eye, until you have \n&gt; checked the plank in your own&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Truthfully, anything we could do to sway this individuals sale of \n&gt; these boxes would be minimal. Negativity and greed always find a \n&gt; crack to seep through.\n&gt; \n&gt; My suggestion is lets try a little harder to spread the word of the \n&gt; research and educate individuals that are or may become interested, \n&gt; through all the various outlets available to us on the web concerning \n&gt; the paranormal research community. There are endless chat boards, \n&gt; groups and forums plus websites and word of mouth. \n&gt; Instead of trying to stop this idiot from defrauding innocent \n&gt; unknowledgable people. Lets make sure the knowledge is out there for \n&gt; them and we are here to help them and guy&#39;s like Mr. ebay will \n&gt; disappear on their own.\n&gt; \n&gt; And we will not have expended an ounce of negative energy in the \n&gt; process.\n&gt; That&#39;s how I feel, but that&#39;s just me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;\n\n\n\n                           \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nYou rock.
