Most of them are very clear. \nThe one about St. Patrick sounds like &quot;That&#39;s St. Patrick&quot; to my ears.\n\nJeremy\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ecuyler&quot; &lt;ecuyler@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s a lot of files.  I&#39;ll have to listen to them in a little bit. \n&gt; It&#39;s funny you mention St. Patrick.  I recently found out that one of\n&gt; my ancestors was king of Ireland and was killed by St. Patrick because\n&gt; he would not convert.  Changed my whole view on St. Patty&#39;s day.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeremy\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot;\n&gt; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; hey everyone,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I had a really terrific session recently and posted a bunch of\nfiles.
