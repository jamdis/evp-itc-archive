Thanks Misty.
   
  Would you by chance have the You Tube site where that is for the 12-470?

  Mike posted some videos on his website for both hacks the 12-469 and the 12-470. They are also on youtube. For the 470 its pretty much just snipping the wire that goes to the mute instead of removing a pin in the 469.
   
  People say they have good results with the 470 because the 469 has a clicking noise.

      Hello all !!
I have been lurking on the board for awhile, feeling not much to 
contribute.
I am interested in this connection and communication (Thanks to 
Debbie !!)
I've observed a few things on the board. Somehow this word "purple" 
keeps popping up and I can't help but to think of the color purple in 
the spectrum. Does the color relate to some sort of sound wave 
also ? or correlates to something in the electronic field that your 
helpers from the other side are trying to propose ?

Also, I have noticed that the Frank boxes do not seem to be 
distributed to many women (is this because women do not have good 
results with the other side ?)
I know Debbie has done a lot of successful work, but, does this mean 
that women have a more difficult time with communication ?

I don't have a box and I don't know how to build one !! I went to 
radio shack and whatever was recommended is replaced with the new 470.

I don't know where to begin except that Frank recommended starting 
with EVPMAKER. I'd like to build something of my own and don't know 
where to start with a receiver/scanner of my own.
I'd be so happy if someone could share some technology with me !!!??
thanks, Holly
