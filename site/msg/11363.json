Constantine Raudive\nused germanium diodes to capture EVPs. Siedle built his psychophone,\nGeorge Meeks had the Spiricom tone device. Now you have the diode for\nwhite noise, radio wave HF static, and a tone device. I am attempting\nto build an all in one audio recording and communication device. I am\ndoing this to see if by having a combined unit you can get contact\nwith either one or the other or perhaps multiple contacts at one time.  \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you define with some detail &quot;all ways&quot; ?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- seanjankowski1@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: &quot;seanjankowski1&quot; &lt;seanjankowski1@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] All In One Device\n&gt; Date: Wed, 25 Jun 2008 15:10:33 -0000\n&gt; \n&gt; This is my first post. I was wondering if anyone had created an all in\n&gt; one ITC EVP device. I know that researchers such as Seidle had created\n&gt; the psychophone that seemed to cover many aspects of ITC but I have\n&gt; yet to see all ways of communication in one device.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have created an all in one design that covers most of the devices\n&gt; used. If you wish I will share the design.\n&gt;"}
