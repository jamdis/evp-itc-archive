Sometimes I think he is a figment of our imagination. LOL
You never see him, you never hear him, but he's always  around .. :))
 
If he does whine and _ itch, he doesn't do it too much on this website.
And he is the only one who has a real good reason to do it, if you really think about it...
 
You would think that the imagination could come up with a better name than Frank though.... :))
 
 
Ya'll have a good one, and remember  LOVE ONE ANOTHER  ( take that however you want to)
 
I love this group  :))

Will you guys STOP this arguing stuff.
The only man that I can see that I respect is Frank.
He doesn't get into all of this pettiness.
Now, all of you get over yourselves and remember why you started doing this.....
 
CAN'T WE ALL JUST GET ALONG !!!!!

obviously steve, you fail to remember when just a week ago i had to
apologize to you for asking you a question that i had no idea you and
the other person did not speak? i was only interested in the
technology and furthering itc research. but i guess that one question
came across too smug.

you said to black bear that he doesn't know you he dislikes you. I
don't think that is the case at all. i still don't have a problem with
you either. all i ever wanted to do is talk about the research you
were doing.

I now have 2 frank's boxes (the GHOSTMAN 3 and FB#33) to do my
research. (btw.. i thanks you a bunch already frank.. so thank you again)

Steve, you come across as an expert is all i am saying. that is why i
contacted you. "boxmaster estraordinaire" is it? For you to say "who
is this guy?" and cause problems for a mutual friend is absurd. so..
for you and everyone to know a little about me...

oct 22 i turn 33 years old. I have been interested in the box
technology for a few years now. i have been doing paranormal
investigations for 19 years now and took a 3 year break (which is when
you popped up on the scene.) Now i'm back and hitting it hard again
and want to be able to use the best equipment that money can't buy.

Frank doesn't even pretend to be an expert nor does he expect his name
to be mentioned every time an article is published. anyways.. i
probably said more than i should have already.

bear... i'm up for that duel.. sounds fun...lol best one wins a
"certificate of expertification" sign by the us president... lol

btw.. one rule bear... no cutting and pasting clips together to make
one up. haha
