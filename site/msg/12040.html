&gt; Hmmm...some of the same files from other list members work but not 
those. 
&gt; We even sorted out our cookies...and checked and eliminated a lot 
of other crap in the Internet Options section of the Settings and 
they still won&#x27;t work. Has me quite puzzled...

&gt; Occasionally that happens. Dont know why.
&gt; 
&gt; Usually just saving the file and opening it with audacity does the 
&gt; trick for me, or other file player besides win media player. I do 
not 
&gt; know why it has a conflict with some files I have seen different 
&gt; modes, stereo mono, and diff hz files that do not want to open in 
&gt; windows media player. Often a file you clipped beside it using same 
&gt; settings will open fine while the other dont.
