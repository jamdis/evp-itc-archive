A woman contacted me through my Ghosts and Apparitions web site  \nabout a very weird photo. And it is weird, and tied to what may be  \nparanormal activity at her house. I&#39;m not a field researcher, but  \nbecause this woman lives not too far from me, and because I&#39;m pretty  \nimpressed with the picture, and because she&#39;s quite scared and so are  \nher kids, I&#39;ve told her I&#39;ll try to get some folks to drop my and  \ndiscretely suss out the situation.\n\nRalph or anyone interested in hearing more about this?\n\nAnn"}
