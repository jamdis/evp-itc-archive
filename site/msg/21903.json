I don&#39;t know what\n&gt; &gt; language it is. You can hear my dog in the background panting and shaking.\n&gt; &gt; He has tags on his collar that rattle when he shakes. You can also hear\n&gt; &gt; birds outside where I had my window open, but that&#39;s not until near the end.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s what I think I can hear so far.
