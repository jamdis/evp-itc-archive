I found the link I had mentioned. I&#x27;m sure this will not be &#x27;clickable&#x27; because the link is too long for Yahoo posts like this one. You may have to cut and paste this into a browser. The title may come off sounding a bit negative, don&#x27;t shoot the messanger :-).http://etheric-studies.aaevp.com/best_practices_development/index.phptitle=Locating_EVP_formation_and_detecting_false_positivesDave--- lisby@earthlink.net wrote:From: &quot;lisbyfarrum&quot; &lt;lisby@earthlink.net&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.comSubject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Just A Little SpoiledDate: Tue, 29 Jan 2008 15:00:02 -0000Well, I&#x27;m glad to hear it, but as of last week, the leaders wereunreceptive to the idea that this phenomenon was real.Ann--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; There is a radio sweep forum on AA-EVP for members.

And I agree with you about the overnight change. &gt; Orgs like AA-EVP that aren&#x27;t dealing with the boxes are missing the &gt; boat.&gt; &gt; Ann&gt; &gt; On Jan 28, 2008, at 8:48 PM, Jules wrote:&gt; &gt; &gt; Well guys, I have to tell you that since I started box sessions in&gt; &gt; November I have become so spoiled that conventional EVP just don&#x27;t do&gt; &gt; it for me.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; My organization was asked to come and do an investigation at a very&gt; &gt; historial place (here in Illinois). The owner of this home asked if I&gt; &gt; would bring one of the boxes to the home (he is amazed with the&gt; &gt; immediately 2 way communication). So upon respectfully asking my tec&gt; &gt; if it was alright to do a session outside the my home we did several&gt; &gt; box sessions along with conventional EVP. We wanted to see if we could&gt; &gt; discover some unanswered history about the residence, and the &gt; &gt; otherside&gt; &gt; was more than willing to comply.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have to tell you that the regular EVP recordings were and are the&gt; &gt; most boring data to review. Something I use to love so much has&gt; &gt; actually turned into a project given I am waiting for a response&gt; &gt; immediately! Too funny how things can change overnight!&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I will be uploading some files for these sessions if you are &gt; &gt; interested.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Juli&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
