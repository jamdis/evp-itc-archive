Yes.  I have some mediumistic abilities and find working with my Shack 
hack as a good complement to that.  I've gotten confirmation through the 
box of some things I'd been told psychically.  It's also been helpful in 
that getting information in a physical/auditory manner helps keep me 
from thinking that the psychic stuff is all just my imagination.

I'll second the suggestion to go into it with a positive frame of mind.  
Other than that, I can truthfully say that it's helped me in that respect.
