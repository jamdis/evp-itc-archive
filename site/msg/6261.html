Frank R.
 
Isn't that what I said in my initial post?
 
If not that's what=
 I meant!
 
I have been saying all along we need to spread the positive mes=
sage and create harmony.
 
but I believe it starts here with the researcher=
s, lets develop harmony of mind and energy amongst ourselves 
while spreadi=
ng the word to others.

You can disagree, I will let'cha! LOL I think this is a =
misunderstanding between us once again. The whole point of the communicatio=
n is to bring about the spiritual evolution of mankind. To convince not us =
but others that their is an existence greater than the small petty worlds w=
e have created around ourselves. They mean to increase our humanity, tolera=
nce to change, and unconditional love for one another so that we can join t=
hat existence with comfort. The very same communications you are getting fr=
om Mike and Lisa, you are getting by way of influence through your spiritua=
l connection to them and many others who remain silent.It is our job to spr=
ead the word to as many that will listen of what we have learned. Not to ju=
st sit in our extra bedrooms, garages, attics or whatever and test differen=
t combinations of radios and misc circuitry. The positive messages are what=
 is important not the equipment. We need to change people's attitudes.Regar=
