Its very easy to do.\n\nMisty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Brian Watts &lt;ghostly_rider1@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello everyone\n&gt; \n&gt; My name is Brian and I just joined the group to better understand \nhow the box works. I know it&#39;s a subject that has been in the \nparanormal community for some time now. They are a lot that don&#39;t \nbelieve in the box and think that it&#39;s a lot of hogwash. All I can \nsay is that people thought, that the Wright Brothers where crazy to \nthink they could fly,  and where are we today! So I look at the box \nas a possibility and would like to better understand how this box may \nwork.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of my first questions is, what does ITC stand for?\n&gt; \n&gt; I know what EVP stands for (Electronic Voice Phenomenon). \n&gt; \n&gt; I am not a paranormal researcher nor do I belong to any ghost \nhunting/research group but, I do have a strong interest in it. My \nwife and I will go out at times to graveyards and/or place looking \nfor paranormal activity. We did get some EVPs at once with a digital \nrecorder.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; ~Brian\n&gt;"}
