<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;d really like to listen to these, but when I try to open them, I  
get nothing at all. Can you upload them to our files or just attach  
them to e-mail or both?

&gt; Good Evening!
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ve been very busy today going through a long, intense audio
&gt; recording taken at the Gainesville, Texas house, which my team
&gt; investigated on Sunday, November 25th.
&gt;
&gt; All of the EVPs I just posted were gathered in the unoccupied
&gt; upstairs bedroom. Only three investigators were present in the room.
&gt; Their voices have been properly taken into account and ruled out as
&gt; sources of the actual EVPs.
&gt;
&gt; The new and resampled EVPs have been saved as .mp3 files. They can be
&gt; freely downloaded from the site here -
&gt;
&gt; http://www.filecrunch.com/user/orbhunterx
&gt;
&gt; You will hear quite a few odd words, dog barks, and even mimicry.
&gt; Some of the voices are faint and whispery. Other EVP voices sound
&gt; like the invisibles are standing right along side the researchers!
&gt;
&gt; Sexual Content Warning:
&gt;
&gt; Several of the EVPs have strong sexual content.
&gt;
&gt; Please read the file name prior to downloading.
&gt;
&gt; Listening to the EVPs will be at your own disgression.
&gt;
&gt; That stated, those that choose to listen to the EVPs, please let me
&gt; know if any of them need further contextual clarification. I look
&gt; forward to hearing feedback. As it stands, the true nature of what&#x27;s
&gt; going on in the house awaits much more serious attention.
&gt;
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; Lance Oliver, Founder
