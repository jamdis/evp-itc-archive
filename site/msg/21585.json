I tried to explain \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I had EVPs on the radio since the early 70&#39;s. Back then people would think \n&gt; &gt;EVP \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was evil and many would attack me even though I was under age. I also \n&gt; &gt;explained \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EVP to many people because I had a vision of how too do Ghostbox by \n&gt; &gt;flipping \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; radio dial. I also explained:Ã‚Â Songs can be used like Tarot cards! \n&gt; &gt;Anything can \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speak to a person like the wind for example..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Besides having visions I also used to sing songs on the radio years before \n&gt; &gt;they \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; came out. The news recorded me many times singing songs and warning of \n&gt; &gt;things \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before they happened. That&#39;s how I got to do movie/rock star readings and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;warned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of things like 9/11 to politicians and put things in the media like &quot;The \n&gt; &gt;plane! \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The plane!&quot; on Fantacy Island. http://youtu.be/_xG7Qwv23sgÃ‚Â that would \n&gt; &gt;warn of \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the 9/11 terror attacks or actually warning of the conspiricy with-in and \n&gt; &gt;that \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone was doing something.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The 9/11 emergency phone number is also a warning of Ã‚Â 9/11 terror \n&gt; &gt;attacks and \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the feeling someone was going to do something.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I am saying isÃ‚Â I was there (in the 70&#39;s)with the politicians in \n&gt; &gt;Canada \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warning of 9/11 to Americain politiciansÃ‚Â saying we would make the \n&gt; &gt;emergency \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phone number the same accross north America and what the number meant. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We also spoke of the TV shows that warned of 9/11. Fantacy Island, SCTV and \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;many \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other tv shows or songs that would have a 9/11 feeling. SCTV is a great \n&gt; &gt;example \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of thisÃ‚Â where all of Canada was saying &quot;Take-off eh. Like you know eh, \n&gt; &gt;you \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hosers you know.&quot; It even became a hit song. http://youtu.be/1BFPt001PYU \n&gt; &gt;Rush \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sang with the SCTV comediens Bob and Doug and it became a large part of a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Canadian&#39;s identity, &quot;Like you know,eh?&quot;(a psychic expression like we all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; know)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did this type of thing for many TV shows, movies, songs and politicians \n&gt; &gt;of \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many countries. I put my image in some of it and it shows too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The whole time people have been trying to dismiss me, get me to loose me \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jobs,loose Ã‚Â girlfriend and Ã‚Â friends.
