<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks, Misty.  I hear you loud and clear...

I&#x27;m just finishing up on another little research device I&#x27;ll be 
sharing with the group before the day&#x27;s out.
It&#x27;s similar to my last diode thing, just a slight bit different.
I hope it works...

&gt; Misty,
&gt; I would like to be allowed to respond to mike colletta in a 
professional
&gt; and civil manner
&gt; I promise a well worded and truthful rebuttal.
&gt; Bruce &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Bruce,
&gt; 
&gt; I almost decided to let you do that but then I thought about it. I 
also 
&gt; remembered past issues. It&#x27;s fine if you want to respond. In fact I 
&gt; think I have no right to deny you to do that. However I do have a 
right 
&gt; to keep you guys from duking it out HERE in this forum. It has been 
&gt; disrupted enough with the petty arguments. So find another place to 
&gt; have your word wars because most of the members here are NOT 
involved 
&gt; and should not be subjected to such displays of ego.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m sorry but I have to deny your request for membership again. 
&gt; Normally I would email this to you personally but I want everyone 
here 
&gt; to know that this type of behavior is no longer tolerated. I just 
do 
&gt; not have time to be referee to peoples personal squabbles. So if 
you 
&gt; are here to research and learn then no problem. That is what this 
forum 
&gt; is for. If you are here just to be a negative influence then please 
&gt; take it somewhere else. This forum is not a battle ground. 
&gt; ________________
&gt; Mike, 
&gt; 
&gt; I understand why the conflict made you want to post here but again 
this 
&gt; is not the place for it. As I stated before most of the members 
here 
&gt; are not involved in this conflict and shouldnt have to be subjected 
to 
&gt; two grown men duking it out over something that they had no part in 
or 
&gt; even knew about. Most are here to learn and share and move forward. 
&gt; ________________
&gt; Everyone Else,
&gt; Up til now this has been a free posting forum and nobody has been 
&gt; moderated. However that could change so please rethink your actions 
&gt; before posting here. 
&gt; 
&gt; So post it on your websites, start your own forums with your own 
rules 
&gt; that allow someone to be &quot;victorious&quot;. I see no victory in this for 
&gt; either side and having said that I wish you all well in your 
research. 
&gt; 
&gt; Misty
