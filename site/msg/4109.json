I&#39;m familiar with\nspirit communications using boxes like Frank&#39;s, the mini-box, and RS\nhack. I&#39;ve seen the picture of Frank with the mini-box. Frank, it\nlooks to me that you are promoting this mini-box. Is that correct? If\nso, is it the only box that you are promoting now? Or are they just\nusing your image and a few of your statements to push their box? What\nI heard of the C2C show it seemed to me that it was more of a\npromotion for the mini-box. They posted something about that their box\nhas a cleaner signal and Frank&#39;s box had more noise to it. Well,\nsometimes in this line of work you want to have a little bit of\ninherent noise. I know that the RS radio has to meet FCC Class B\nregulations Part 15. As for being a cleaner signal, I would think that\nthe RS radio would actually be, than the mini-box. I have heard both\nthe mini-box and the RS hack and I can&#39;t tell a lot of differences\nbetween the two except for the price. It&#39;s my understanding that the\nmini-box is selling around $400 and that&#39;s a lot of money for just a\nAM radio. The RS radio is selling for $24.95 and I know people are\ngetting some great results with the RS hack. Just my two cents worth!!\n\nSam"}
