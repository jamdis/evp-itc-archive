I am al=\r\nways willing and hopefully able to help new researchers with \n      my advi=\r\nce and knowledge I have gained through experience. But my ideology is not t=\r\nhe end all explanation or truth of box research\n      all opinions here are=\r\n valuable and deserving of consideration and attention.\n       \n      As fo=\r\nr your question, the fact that I am blessed enough to receive a fairly good=\r\n level of communication I believe is based once \n      again on the relatio=\r\nnship I have built with my tech/guides and the synchronization of energy we=\r\n have developed.\n      The level of communication we are at I believe is on=\r\nly the very tip of the iceberg. My goal in &quot;MY&quot; research is to reach a leve=\r\nl of communication that \n      allows us to speak easily and freely with ou=\r\nr spirit friends in a fluid and continual fashion as if having a pleasant t=\r\nelephone conversation.\n       \n      The gist of the messages I am receivin=\r\ng now are directed toward our spirit counterparts achieving the same goal. =\r\nIt is already a comfort to me to know they are there and I have had the opp=\r\nortunity to speak with close family members and friends that have crossed o=\r\nver. And also recently Ms. Sarah Estep who has made the transition and is b=\r\neginning to work now on the\n      spirit side to further the communication.=\r\n Any information I receive from the spirits I recognise to be friends is in=\r\nvaluable. Something as simple as a yes or no answer to a direct question th=\r\nat has just been asked is a small miracle in and of itself. considering how=\r\n it was attained and where it is from. Most researchers I think after a cer=\r\ntain amount of time succumb to the human flaw of complacency and take for g=\r\nranted that when they turn a box on they will receive communication. They l=\r\noose site of the fact that this communication is a precious gift to mankind=\r\n and eventually will change the way we perceive life and death.\n       \n   =\r\n   I don&#39;t know if my thinking or opinions are lucid or the rantings of a m=\r\nad man, I&#39;m sure a lot of people would say both.

Funny thing is, I recognize Mike and Lisa on your recordings too.  I&#39;m =\r\naware that they are acting as facilitators and guardians, that they are con=\r\nsistent in their ability to use varied modes of communication, and that the=\r\nir contact appears to be purposeful, as compared to so much that seems to h=\r\nave no rhyme or reason.  \n\n        As a newbie I&#39;m admittedly intimidated b=\r\ny and in awe of the results you more experienced researchers are accomplish=\r\ning.  What I find most awesome is that everyone can have different methods,=\r\n belief systems and opinions and come together in one forum to share and le=\r\narn from one another.  I feel so lucky to have found you!  Bruce, your abil=\r\nity to hear and accurately repeat my one posted EVP is the only validation =\r\nI&#39;ve personally ever received that makes me know I&#39;m involved in something =\r\nreal and life altering.  I&#39;m supposed to be here!  I think a big part of my=\r\n education will continue to come from the knowledge and experience you all =\r\nare willing to keep sharing.  It&#39;s also a fact that each of us needs to fin=\r\nd his/her own individual truth.  \n\n        I&#39;m still troubled by the possib=\r\nility that we could be pawns in Someone Else&#39;s science experiment.  I can s=\r\nense Frank&#39;s cynicism related to the messages being meaningless and the mes=\r\nsengers being untrustworthy.  In your own case, what is the goal?  Is the f=\r\nact that you&#39;ve established communication and continue to communicate enoug=\r\nh?  Are we hoping to gain invaluable information from our guides, or just t=\r\no have the comfort of knowing they are there?  \n\n        This is the week I=\r\n&#39;ve promised myself to start doing sessions with the Radio Shack hacks!  \n\n=\r\n        Robin\n\n\n\n\n\n        hoogroups.com&lt;mailto:myself.@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n =\r\n         Sent: Sunday, February 03, 2008 6:25 AM\n          Subject: RE: [EV=\r\nP-ITC] Re: File from tonight\n\n\n          Robin,\n           \n          I agr=\r\nee with Steve on a couple of points. First let me say that I\n          do b=\r\nelieve that we all have a &quot;technician/guide/guardian&quot; call them what you\n  =\r\n        may. but I usually call them by the names they introduced themselve=\r\ns by.\n           \n          I know for a fact through many, many, many box =\r\nsessions that when I turn\n          a box on, could be Frank&#39;s box or the m=\r\ninibox or the RS 470 does not matter which.\n           \n          The same =\r\ntwo entities will come through immediately, So much so now, that I do not e=\r\nven ask for conformation that\n          it is in fact them. I recognise the=\r\nir individual voice patterns. I have built a solid relationship with these =\r\ntwo spirits\n          I know as mike and Lisa so much so that I have even g=\r\notten to know their individual personalities.\n           \n          There a=\r\nre other newer researchers here that will attest to the fact that when they=\r\n where doing their first sessions\n          I had asked my two &quot;Friends&quot; Mi=\r\nke and Lisa to assist in getting them started and invariably the spirits th=\r\nat came \n          through to these new researchers during their first sess=\r\nions identified themselves as Mike and Lisa.\n           \n          Steve sa=\r\nys he does not turn on his box and use them as a crutch, that is not entire=\r\nly true. I had done research \n          very closely with Steve until recen=\r\ntly and I would venture to say that 99% if not every session he starts with=\r\n &quot;Mike & Lisa\n          are you available to talk with me&quot; \n           \n   =\r\n       Also I don&#39;t consider working with my technicians as using them as a=\r\n crutch, They would not allow that.\n          They are not there like butle=\r\nrs at our beckoned call when we feel they may be of some use.\n          Qui=\r\nte the opposite, without them we would get no communication at all, they ar=\r\ne allowing us the honor of receiving this \n          celestial communicatio=\r\nn. They are the moderators, facilitators and generators of all we hear and =\r\nsend to and from the spirit realm.\n          And they also stand as guards =\r\nand protectors to do the best they can to keep us from being deceived or ta=\r\nken down a dark path.\n           \n          Some here wait for others to st=\r\nate an opinion and then tend to agree with that opinion no matter what they=\r\n have experienced to be true.\n           \n          Robin, my advice to you=\r\n as a new researcher in this field. Form your own beliefs through your expe=\r\nrience and research.\n          Listen and learn from others but do not let =\r\nwhat you believe to be true or not, be swayed by popular opinion.\n         =\r\n  \n          Bruce\n\n\n\n          Bruce Halliday \n\n\n          &lt;http://free-pa=\r\nranormalinvestigating.com/%3C/div%3E%3C/div%3E%3Cp%20/%3E%3Cdiv%20class=3D&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n  =\r\n          To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n            From: MudPuddleFarm@msn.c=\r\nom\n            Date: Sat, 2 Feb 2008 21:42:09 -0800\n            Subject: Re=\r\n: [EVP-ITC] Re: File from tonight\n\n\n            Steve,\n\n            I certa=\r\ninly appreciate your thoughts.

I am always willing and \n      hopefully able to help new re=\r\nsearchers with &lt;BR&gt;my advice and knowledge I \n      have gained through exp=\r\nerience. But my ideology is not the end all \n      explanation or truth of =\r\nbox research&lt;BR&gt;all opinions here are valuable and \n      deserving of cons=\r\nideration and attention.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;As for your \n      question, the fact=\r\n that I am blessed enough to receive a fairly good level \n      of communic=\r\nation I believe is based once &lt;BR&gt;again on the relationship I \n      have b=\r\nuilt with my tech/guides and the synchronization of energy we have \n      d=\r\neveloped.&lt;BR&gt;The level of communication we are at I believe is only the \n  =\r\n    very tip of the iceberg. My goal in &quot;MY&quot; research is to reach a level o=\r\nf \n      communication that &lt;BR&gt;allows us to speak easily and freely with o=\r\nur \n      spirit friends in a fluid and continual fashion as if having a pl=\r\neasant \n      telephone conversation.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The gist of the messages=\r\n I am \n      receiving now are directed toward our spirit counterparts achi=\r\neving the \n      same goal. It is already a comfort to me to know they are =\r\nthere and I have \n      had the opportunity to speak with close family memb=\r\ners and friends that \n      have crossed over. And also recently Ms. Sarah =\r\nEstep who has made the \n      transition and is beginning to work now on th=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;spirit side to further \n      the communication. Any information I rec=\r\neive from the spirits I recognise \n      to be friends is invaluable. Somet=\r\nhing as simple as a yes or no answer to \n      a direct question that has j=\r\nust been asked is a small miracle in and of \n      itself. considering how =\r\nit was attained and where it is from. Most \n      researchers I think after=\r\n a certain amount of time succumb to the human \n      flaw of complacency a=\r\nnd take for granted that when they turn a box on they \n      will receive c=\r\nommunication. They loose site of the fact that this \n      communication is=\r\n a precious gift to mankind and eventually will change the \n      way we pe=\r\nrceive life and death.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;I don&#39;t know if my thinking \n      or o=\r\npinions are lucid or the rantings of a mad man, I&#39;m sure a lot of \n      pe=\r\nople would say both. For what it is worth this is how I believe on the \n   =\r\n   questions you asked.&lt;BR&gt;for better or \nworse.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Bruce&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;\n      &lt;DIV align=3Dcenter&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D4&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0033cc&gt;&lt;STRONG=\r\n&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT \n      color=3D#000000 size=3D5&gt;Bruce Halliday &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;=\r\n/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A \n      title=3Dhttp://free-paranormalinvestigating.com/%3C/d=\r\niv%3E%3C/div%3E%3Cp%20/%3E%3Cdiv%20class=3D \n      href=3D&quot;http://free-para=\r\nnormalinvestigating.com/%3C/div%3E%3C/div%3E%3Cp%20/%3E%3Cdiv%20class=3D&quot;

call them what you&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;may. but I \n          usually call them by the names they introduced the=\r\nmselves \n          by.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;I know for a fact through many, many, m=\r\nany box \n          sessions that when I turn&lt;BR&gt;a box on, could be Frank&#39;s =\r\nbox or the \n          minibox or the RS 470 does not matter which.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;The same two \n          entities will come through immediately, So muc=\r\nh so now, that I do not \n          even ask for conformation that&lt;BR&gt;it is =\r\nin fact them. I recognise \n          their individual voice patterns. I hav=\r\ne built a solid relationship \n          with these two spirits&lt;BR&gt;I know as=\r\n mike and Lisa so much so that I \n          have even gotten to know their =\r\nindividual \n          personalities.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;There are other newer res=\r\nearchers here \n          that will attest to the fact that when they where =\r\ndoing their first \n          sessions&lt;BR&gt;I had asked my two &quot;Friends&quot; Mike =\r\nand Lisa to assist in \n          getting them started and invariably the sp=\r\nirits that came &lt;BR&gt;through \n          to these new researchers during thei=\r\nr first sessions identified \n          themselves as Mike and Lisa.&lt;BR&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;BR&gt;Steve says he does not turn \n          on his box and use them as a c=\r\nrutch, that is not entirely true. I had \n          done research &lt;BR&gt;very c=\r\nlosely with Steve until recently and I would \n          venture to say that=\r\n 99% if not every session he starts with &quot;Mike \n          &amp; Lisa&lt;BR&gt;are=\r\n you available to talk with me&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Also I \n          don&#39;t consi=\r\nder working with my technicians as using them as a crutch, \n          They =\r\nwould not allow that.&lt;BR&gt;They are not there like butlers at our \n          =\r\nbeckoned call when we feel they may be of some use.&lt;BR&gt;Quite the \n         =\r\n opposite, without them we would get no communication at all, they are \n   =\r\n       allowing us the honor of receiving this &lt;BR&gt;celestial communication.=\r\n \n          They are the moderators, facilitators and generators of all we =\r\nhear \n          and send to and from the spirit realm.&lt;BR&gt;And they also sta=\r\nnd as \n          guards and protectors to do the best they can to keep us f=\r\nrom being \n          deceived or taken down a dark path.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Some =\r\nhere wait for \n          others to state an opinion and then tend to agree =\r\nwith that opinion no \n          matter what they have experienced to be tru=\r\ne.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Robin, my \n          advice to you as a new researcher in t=\r\nhis field.

Tech=\r\nnicians i &lt;BR&gt;have found \n              were used to get you up and running=\r\n and i only now call on \n              &lt;BR&gt;them if i need assistance. I don=\r\n&#39;t turn the boxes on and ask \n              for &lt;BR&gt;them like a crutch, i c=\r\nonduct my session and if i need \n              help they will &lt;BR&gt;supply it=\r\n to me if needed. I think the whole \n              idea is to find out who =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;we are communicating with, maybe we \n              will never really kn=\r\now for sure &lt;BR&gt;but i still try and find out \n              as best as i ca=\r\nn. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-Steve H.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A \n              title=3Dmailto:EVP-ITC=\r\n@yahoogroups.com \n              href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP=\r\n-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;, \n              &quot;Robin Searcy Henson&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&lt=\r\n;MudPuddleFarm@&lt;WBR&gt;...&gt; \n              wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Hi Frank,=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When you \n              mention being distrustful of wha=\r\nt comes through the boxes, &lt;BR&gt;are \n              you saying you&#39;re skeptic=\r\nal of the &quot;technicians&quot; being who they \n              &lt;BR&gt;say they are?
