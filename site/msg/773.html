Frank!
I went to that url you listed here and I saw where you posted. Here =
I was, thinking that you were OLD, but to my surprise, you and I are the sa=
me age! Well, at least for the moment. I was born May 9th, 1953. So you may=
 actually be older or younger, but we're both 53 right now! I find this amu=
sing! I should have known! LOL Learn something new everyday! Ain't that the=
 truth! 
That site I went to, about Montague Keen, was very interesting! I =
joined also! It's all very impressive! What do you think the big "breakthro=
ugh" in spirit communication is going to be? 
Thanks for the info,
Candi

  Yeah, there are examples on the sites I w=

  like that too, using the crowd nois=
e from one of our school board meetings. 
  There was some ghopst voices mi=

  anything if they know some=
one is/will be listening.
