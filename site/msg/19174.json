It is very sensitive to the Earth&#39;s magnetic field. It is in magnetic\nmode that I have the most trouble. They state this problem in the manual.\nMoving too fast or turning causes the meter to flick. I have the knob for\nthe audible beep trigger turned down most of the time because the constant\nbeeps when I walk or turn get annoying.\n\nIt is a TriFIELD meter, not a TriAXIS meter. I always assumed it had that\nname because it has settings to detect electric, magnetic and RF\n(electromagnetic) fields. Those are the three fields it is capable of\ndetecting.\n\nI also built the scalar electrostatic gradiometer but the thing is not\nalways stable (especially in high-humidity settings). But it surpasses\nanything you can buy commercially.\n\nhttp://amasci.com/freenrg/grado.html\n\nZack\n\nP.S.

This is because the manual\n&gt; sucks and the TV people use it wrong consistently.  To figure it out, I\n&gt; contacted the manufacturer a couple years back and this is what they told\n&gt; me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Always us the Trifield in Magnetic mode.  If the box is stable and there is\n&gt; no lightning, the box should not sound an alarm unless something paranormal\n&gt; is happening (or you move your digital recorder to close to it, magnetized\n&gt; speakers).  If you use electric or combination, you can, and will, pick up\n&gt; the body electric with every motion and may receive many false positives.\n&gt;  The meter should also never be used while walking because this too gives\n&gt; unreliable readings.  There is nothing worse than seeing some TV schmuck\n&gt; holding it in their hands and claiming something paranormal is going on\n&gt; because an alarm is sounding, never mind that the camera is right next to it\n&gt; emitting magnetism through the mic / internal speaker.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, the name trifield is a misnomer.  It only has one plane of reading,\n&gt; not three!  The yellow one (AC) has three fields.  The natural trifield only\n&gt; measures the plane that extends from the top and bottom edges lengthwise\n&gt; from the devices.  So if you have the device sitting upright, you will only\n&gt; measure whatever is above the device.  If you have it laying flat, you will\n&gt; be able to measure the full plane of length extending beyond the bottom and\n&gt; top edges.  Therefore, it is best to use this device slightly elevated and\n&gt; laying flat.\n&gt;\n&gt; Using it in this fashion has yielded some amazing results thus far.  While\n&gt; it is rare for this meter to fire when used properly, when a &quot;spirit&quot;\n&gt; understands how to trigger the alarm you can get conversations that can last\n&gt; upwards of an hour.  I have experiences this only 6 times in all the years I\n&gt; have investigated.  Most of the time, this device yields a single alarm, or\n&gt; maybe two, with no real time interaction with questions.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Nov 9, 2010 at 10:29 AM, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have a Trifield Natural EMF meter. It does not respond to 60 Hz fields.\n&gt;&gt; The problem I have with it is that it is too darned sensitive. It registers\n&gt;&gt; the magnetic field of the earth in magnetic and combination mode and\n&gt;&gt; whenever I turn or move too quickly, the meter flicks. If I run it in\n&gt;&gt; electric field mode it does not do this but I&#39;m always afraid of missing\n&gt;&gt; something, so I generally run it in combination mode.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Zack\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Tue, Nov 9, 2010 at 9:17 AM, Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@gmail.com&gt;wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Like Zack said, nobody knows for sure.  The only thing that we do know is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that there is a correlation between spikes in EMF&#39;s and paranormal events.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  I have used various meters during GB sessions and there is a correlation at\n&gt;&gt;&gt; times, but this has to be discounted solely because a radio uses part of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; EMF spectrum.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It is theorized that EMF measurements are to be taken solely in DC\n&gt;&gt;&gt; current because it is natural electricity.  So any EMF meter you have that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; measures AC is worthless on an investigation because it picks up man made\n&gt;&gt;&gt; electricity.  As for the range, well that is also speculative at best.  The\n&gt;&gt;&gt; most current theories hold that under 30 Hz DC is where you will find the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; most paranormal activity.  This is because the Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta\n&gt;&gt;&gt; brainwaves of a human are all below 30 Hz.  This is where the Body Electric\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fires and consciousness is formed.  If we are dealing with a continuation of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; consciousness, results are more apt to be found in this range.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  Interestingly enough, the earth vibrates in this same range with 5 standing\n&gt;&gt;&gt; waves at or below 33Hz (Shuman Resonance), so it appears that the new agers\n&gt;&gt;&gt; are right when they say we vibrate with the Earth.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; But, as always, no one knows for sure.  And no one knows if these\n&gt;&gt;&gt; frequencies have anything to do with what we receive in GBC.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Tue, Nov 9, 2010 at 5:10 AM, Adriana Jones &lt;adrianamjones@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This has probably already been discussed a hundred times over by people\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; building ghost boxes, but... what&#39;s the average emf range of ghosts... and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would creating sounds in that emf range make it easier for the ghosts to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; communicate?
