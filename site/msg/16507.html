<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s what I thought from the description.

It amazes me what some people sell (and evidently some people buy). I&#x27;ve
seen Linux being sold at various places, and you can download that for free,
too.

&gt; Here&#x27;s the so called &quot;Crossover Talk&quot;. It&#x27;s actually a piece of free
&gt; software that some charlatan decided to cash in on. It&#x27;s evpmaker with an
&gt; allophone file created by Stefan Bion. I guess i just saved some people $50
&gt; or whatever he&#x27;s selling it for. Also, for those who have questions about
&gt; audio editing software there is more people on Ebay selling &quot;Audacity&quot; for
&gt; like $20 and that&#x27;s also free on the internet.

&gt; &gt; I am now wondering what people know about Jason Profits Cross Talk. This
&gt; is something that is being sold on Ebay as a &quot;ghost hunting tool&quot;.
&gt; Supposedly it is better than Frank&#x27;s box or the hack box. Has anyone got
&gt; this or know anything about it?
