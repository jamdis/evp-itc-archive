      Hola Frank!

In a nutshell I'd say it's all about the the worst four letter word 
of the english language - Fear.

If you couple that with some people's perceived loss of control over 
the minds and hearts of others, not to mention cutting their profits, 
it's no stretch of the imagination to see those sort of discussions 
for what they are. 

I've read and studied ITC for many years. I've long waited for some 
device, like my friend Ron's now making, to come along for me to 
actually experiment with. If anything, ITC research points out the 
grantedly subjective need for cooperation and harmony among 
researchers, which I've heard is due to the higher levels of 
vibration in the dimension some go to after this life.

Just find your own place within of peace and tranquility. Bozo's like 
him only have as much voice and power as we ourselves give them. But 
if you really want to mentally slap onery folks like that, why not 
ask them if they're planning another Salem Witch Trial. We all should 
know just how badly that is now seen, not to mention that Salem's now 
witch central of the planet. Law of attraction in action!

My dream is to help in some way to build a bridge of communication 
with the otherside, so the agony and anguish of loosing love ones can 
be ended forever. Life is eternal!

Keep up the good work Frank, Ron and everyone else!!

Lance

Not only that, that we are only getting the 'bad guys'. So which is 
it, false communication, which is no commnunication, or is it evil 
spirits. To make it worse, this idiot implies he has the backing of 
the -------, and the church believes we are letting evil into the 
world. I took this as a severe slap to the face, very insulting to 
me, and every paranormal researcher in the world. He claims the 'real 
voices' he gets are made out of white noise combined with broadcast 
fragments. Duffus!! That is exactly the kind of voices the living 
mind creates to get the voices it wants to hear. Yet only his are the 
real voices! My old friend, you can take your 'serious session' and 
your bishop, and shove 'em. My apoplogies to the group, but I know 
this will get forwarded, and this bozo finds me so easy to dismiss, 
that normal e-mail would be useless. I had to cut some out for nice 
sakes. Frank-S
