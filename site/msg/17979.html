I have placed a little something on top  of my computer monitor, =
right in 
front of me. It  is now 7/10/2010. I will leave it there 4 days, =
 and remove 
it Noon Denver time, on Wednesday,  7/14/2010.

All you have t=
o do is ask your  boxes/spirits/ aliens/etc, what it is.

I  have taken a p=
icture of it, and posted it to the  files section here, so 
there is no way=
 I can  squirm out of the results:

_http://tech.  groups.yahoo. com/group/=
 EVP-ITC/files/  RJ/RJ.20100710. 
1.zip_ (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/grou=
p/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip) 

Please do not  try to open the file=
 before noon Wednesday. But  feel free 
to download it to your computer  be=
forehand, so you can be sure I won't 
change it  during, or after, the test=
.

Answers  anyone reveals after noon Wednesday don't count.  Partial answe=
rs 
(like just the color, or shape,  or some emotion vibe) don't count. Jus=
t 
tell me  what it is.

Best of Luck. I hope for this  to be a regularly o=
ccurring experiment, and 
I  hope we all can learn from the results.
