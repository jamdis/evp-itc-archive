You make good points here.&nbsp; I had to re look at the purpose of the group to see if this was a scientific research group or other.&nbsp; It looks like it is in the &quot;or other&quot; category.&nbsp; I do believe there are strictly research groups around that can apply the rules of scientific testing.&nbsp; More in the hobbyist or enthusiast mode?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;One&nbsp; of the reasons I joined this group&nbsp;is because I appreciate members like Misty for posting their&nbsp;work and not having to do so under some&nbsp;scientific methodology.&nbsp;&nbsp;That, I think, would hinder innovation, testing, sharing and even enjoyment of what we do here.&nbsp; And, again, it is not the stated purpose of this group.&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubters and debunkers certainly have a place in this non-scientific arena, but here I hope to see posts from people who are not afraid to&nbsp;try a technique and then share it with others.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was looking for your posts&nbsp;with the group here...do you have any?&nbsp; I do not mean that as a challenge...I am sincerely interested in hearing&nbsp;your clips.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;best wishes&nbsp;&nbsp; ron l&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=&quot;comic sans ms&quot;
