<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Interesting file. I hear a voice say &quot;king&quot; right before you say kingdom and &quot;amen&quot; after you say amen in the prayer. I also hear the Charlie, as well as the names phillip (repeated twice)and phyllis. When you ask about the ed I hear &quot;he wants to speak&quot; then near the end it spunds like you have a bird or something and last words on that clip after the bird noise I hear is &quot;stop&quot; &quot;why the birds near us&quot;. 

Was that a bird?
