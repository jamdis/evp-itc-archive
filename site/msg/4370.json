I believe that they also \nutilize \n&gt; some of the white noise that is transmitted with the radio signal.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I now only use the recorder with its built in mic and seem to gleen \n&gt; the best results that way. If your recordings are to noisy use can \nalways\n&gt; remove some of the static hiss after on your audio editor.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I use clearvoice denoiser on the lowest setting it does not alter \nthe sound of\n&gt; the recording just removes the unwanted noise.\n&gt;  \n&gt; here is the url for clearvoice \nhttp://www.speechpro.com/eng/products/noise-cancellation-sys/clear-\nvoice/\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: lcdupla@...: Tue, 18 Dec 2007 17:52:18 \n+0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: New Files From RS 470_12-18-07\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce, I think I asked this before, but what microphone are you \nusing and how is everything plugged together? If I understand \ncorrectly, you are using an older 12-470 with a mic in front of it \nrecording you and the built-in speaker, correct? Your earlier \nrecordings sounded like a studio mic or something - very nice.I have \nbeen playing with the Listen Up mic into the recorder, as well as a \nlapel mic. You seem to have less static...I am going to go listen to \nyour latest uploads and let you know what I think.LC--- In EVP-\nITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; \nhey guy&#39;s &gt; &gt; I just posted a bunch of new file to folder RS 470 12-\n18-07 in the &gt; files section.&gt; &gt; have a listen and please leave some \nfeedback.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Share life as it happens with the new Windows Live.\n&gt; http://www.windowslive.com/share.html?\nocid=TXT_TAGHM_Wave2_sharelife_122007\n&gt;"}
