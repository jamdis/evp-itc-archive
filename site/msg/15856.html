Hi everyone. I'm a founding member of the Spokane Paranormal Society and the
caretaker of Lakeview Cemetery in Sprague, Washington.

 

On the issue of hearing what someone says it is, I'd like to call attention
to the issue of misheard lyrics, a similar phenomenon. For example, in the
song "Every Breath You Take" by the Police, does Sting sing "I'm a pool hall
ace" or "How my poor heart aches"? The second is correct, but many people
hear the first. Then, once you know what it really says, you can then hear
the correct lyrics on playback.

 

There is no lyric sheet to refer to with EVP and the answers can be tricky
unless the recording is unusually clear, which is the exception. Everything
else is interpretation. Having multiple people listen to a recording without
being given an interpretation to listen for and then tallying the consensus
is probably the best way to decide what an EVP is likely saying, and even
then, there is still usually room for competing possibilities.

 

As to what type of entity provides the recording, all the answers are purely
speculation. I choose to accept ghosts as the usual suspects in EVP
recordings but even that could be my own predisposition masquerading as
objectivity. Depends on who you ask. Your mileage may vary.

 

I just did a one hour EVP session tonight at the cemetery with the SPS team.
I plan to play it back tomorrow. If I got anything worth repeating, I'll
post about it. One team member heard a small girl humming. Hopefully that
ended up on someone's recorder.

 

EVP is an endlessly fascinating subject!

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: I am new here

 

  

Hello Alan. I guess 'testing' starts with what you believe is beyond
question or cannot be tested, and what you believe should be questioned and
can be tested. Different people believe EVPs fall in different places on
that spectrum of possibilities, and there are different opinions on what the
voices heard are (afterlife? aliens? angels? pareidolia? radio programs?
something else?)

If you wanted to go back to first principles, you could first examine where
you fall on that list, and then determine what tests you could perform to
confirm or dispute that belief. For example, if you believe the voices are
from aliens, it might first be good to determine how you know aliens exist,
since if you can't do even that, the value of the belief the voices are from
aliens, seems to drop alot.

Or, if you are already convinced aliens exist and the voices are from
aliens, you could always try testing their accuracy. For example, getting
dates and very clear predictions, or answers to questions you can confirm,
and go from there. I would avoid yes/no questions, and multiple choice
questions, since that can predispose you to hearing certain answers.

Another tricky thing, is that these often are not clear voices. I have seen
instances where what one person hears is not what another person hears,
which can make it hard to be sure if you are interpreting the sound
correctly. Further, I have seen where a person will listen to a recording,
not know what it is, then be told what it is, and only then can they hear
it. So if you are trying to determine what a voice is saying, and you get
someone else to listen but you first tell them what it says, they might then
hear it when otherwise they would not. So again, for the most objective
testing there, listen to sounds (or have others listen to them) without
first being told what it is supposed to be saying. And using a second person
like this can also help to lessen the possibility you are hearing what you
want to hear.

Of course, if you are not interested in testing, that is also your decision.
Many people do not do any testing: they just make recordings, label them
what they think they say, and upload them to show others. 

Good luck with it.
