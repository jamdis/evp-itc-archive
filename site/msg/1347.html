<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Guy, thanks for helping to preserve this important chapter in ITC 
history. I&#x27;m of the opinion that this early research can help to 
inspire new developments. -Bill

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Sorry, all...really late notice by me here. I was interviewed by
&gt; &gt;Scott and Doug for about an hour yesterday on Ghostly Talk (
&gt; &gt;http://www.ghostlytalk.com ). The topic? New research I&#x27;ve done on
&gt; &gt;the infamous &quot;Spiricom Mark IV&quot;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If you&#x27;re familiar with the story - basically I believe I&#x27;ve helped
&gt; &gt;dispel the goofy thought that Dr. George JEFFRIES Mueller did NOT
&gt; &gt;work for NASA (people have confused him with Dr. George EDWIN
&gt; &gt;Mueller who DID work for NASA and is considered the &quot;father of
&gt; &gt;Skylab&quot;, etc.). Plus I was able to disseminate 2 previously unknown
&gt; &gt;audio recordings (by Dr. David Rivers and the late author Harold
&gt; &gt;Sherman) which showed inconsistencies in the Spiricom recordings 
and
&gt; &gt;how O&#x27;Neil &quot;could&quot; have used an artificial larynx to fake the
&gt; &gt;conversations. On the other hand - I tracked down a lot of
&gt; &gt;documentation which definitely shows that Dr. George J. Mueller was
&gt; &gt;a real person and nearly everything written about him (in the
&gt; &gt;Spiricom manual, &quot;The Ghost of 29 Megacycles&quot;) is verifiable so...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The big questions are:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1. If this was a hoax - how DID Bill O&#x27;Neil get so much detailed
&gt; &gt;information on Mueller (he actually claimed that Mueller told him
&gt; &gt;all this via clairaudience)? Was he really an extremely good 
psychic?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;2. If the Spiricom Mark IV really DID work, why were other users
&gt; &gt;(such as Sarah Estep from the AAEVP) unable to get it operate?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I still have more things to look into so maybe some more answers
&gt; &gt;will be forthcoming (or muddy the waters even more). And I want to
&gt; &gt;thank member Jaime (i.e. xtal32768@...) for finding the
&gt; &gt;Cornell Alumni News with photo of Mueller at Picatinny Arsenal.
&gt; &gt;
