I have gotten some very long sequences and have posted them, as they  
were given to me. I do not clip anything out. My messages come  
through very, very quickly, so I do slow them and often amplify the  
sequence. So, long sequences are indeed possible and do happen. I  
just want you to know that is the case.

&gt; My only problem with this is when I did started Box research 2 1/2  
&gt; - 3 Months ago.  From ghost box research (not sound soap, or  
&gt; EVPmaker) I saw alot of messages/files posted  that were 4-10 words  
&gt; long, and you and others were bragging on how long of a message  
&gt; y&#x27;all had, and that nobody else could get messages that long.  That  
&gt; is were I feel that I have been mislead.  I didn&#x27;t know that those  
&gt; files/messages had the garbage cut out of it.  I actually thought  
&gt; y&#x27;all got messages that long from the radio/Franks Box.  I was  
&gt; trying to get communication like that,  and wondered why I  
&gt; couldn&#x27;t.  I do know now that it is physically possible to get that  
&gt; type of communication after I lost my session 22, but it doesn&#x27;t  
&gt; happen like that every time.  I mean no disrespect about this  
&gt; situation.  Also I don&#x27;t see myself as a &quot;Newbie&quot; anymore.  If you  
&gt; want to go by ranks, I would like to be refer ed as a &quot;amateur box  
&gt; researcher&quot;.  If you have anything else to say, I think it needs to  
&gt; be taken care of in private emails.  You should have my work and  
&gt; personal email addresses.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks

&gt; William,
&gt;
&gt; With all do respect and I do mean that.
&gt;
&gt; You are a newbie and you just started box research.
&gt; You are pursuing this subject quite passionately.
&gt;
&gt; If you feel that you have been misled in any advice or  
&gt; representation here.
&gt; Go back and look at the posts from when you first started asking  
&gt; questions.
&gt;
&gt; you will note that I have always said that the &quot;CRAP&quot; was cut from  
&gt; my files
&gt; and even have recommended audio programs to new researchers for  
&gt; that specific purpouse.
&gt;
&gt; And you seem to be under the misconception that because you take  
&gt; out the blips and blurbs
&gt; that the message or answer somehow changes, no it does not!
&gt;
&gt; the message is the same only the bits of noise crap are gone.
&gt; It&#x27;s like you speaking a sentence once and coughing in the middle,  
&gt; and then repeating the sentence without coughing.
&gt; It&#x27;s the same sentence with the same meaning, minus the cough.
&gt;
&gt; William, I like you and your dedication to learning this research,  
&gt; but you are still learning and should take in subjects like this  
&gt; and digest them
&gt; before arguing the point with much more experienced researchers.
&gt;
&gt; Again no disrespect meant, just some advice from a friend.

&gt;
&gt; My point is let everybody know that the clip is cut, because it  
&gt; just might mislead people (Newbies) in thinking that you get  
&gt; messages that long without all the bullshit.  They might wander why  
&gt; they can&#x27;t get a messages like that.  I think I been somewhat mis  
&gt; lead myself on this subject when I first started box research.

&gt; Stefan,
&gt;
&gt; I do remove the &quot;garbage&quot; from my files.
&gt;
&gt; At this point in my research, the message is more important to me  
&gt; than the proof of it.
&gt; I think most of us here will agree that we are receiving some sort  
&gt; of paranormal communication.
&gt; but it definitely exists. now we need to concentrate on the  
&gt; messages they need us to hear and the answers to the questions
&gt; we ask and in turn our answers to their questions. Anyone that  
&gt; cleans a file in this way should not be touching any bit of the file
&gt; that has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously  
&gt; garbage like the &quot;EH O EH AH O EH UR&quot; in between words.
&gt;
&gt; For example &quot;Is there anyone here that wishes to communicate_YES_AH  
&gt; ER EEH AR OOO AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE&quot;
&gt; It is much easier for me as a researcher to be able to return to a  
&gt; file that I recieved two weeks ago and that I believe may hold some
&gt; relivence to a message I just received and be able to cleanly  
&gt; listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage sounds.
&gt;
&gt; At this stage in real time communication the messages are the top  
&gt; priority.
&gt; I do however agree that the untouched version should be retained  
&gt; and made available to individuals that make a request
&gt; for any intelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that may be  
&gt; made, and god knows there are always fanatical
&gt; sceptics lurking in the shadows awaiting an opportunity to attack  
&gt; an unwary or injured researcher. I do not think that
&gt; our research files should be made available on request by every tom  
&gt; dick and harry that is unknown to us and may potentially
&gt; doctor the file to suit their own point and post it as such.
&gt;
&gt; I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the  
&gt; researcher that receives the request for raw research data should
&gt; scrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment before  
&gt; handing out any research data.
&gt;
&gt; These are my thoughts on the subject of cleaning a file.

&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Editing EVP
&gt;
&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I would
&gt; suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, in
&gt; order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can for
&gt; instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (including
&gt; the experimenter&#x27;s voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer,  
&gt; but
&gt; not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP  
&gt; match
&gt; with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should always
&gt; be provided along with the edited version.
&gt;
&gt; But that&#x27;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to  
&gt; express, as
&gt; we should always be able to present our results to a critical public.
&gt;
&gt; Stefan
&gt;
&gt; -- 
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these files.
&gt; &gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that
&gt; &gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the message
&gt; &gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise that
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can&#x27;t piece these
&gt; &gt; files together to make something it&#x27;s not, so i keep them in true
&gt; &gt; form pretty much to the original.
