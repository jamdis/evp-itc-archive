Been some good stuff.  Hope everyne is doing well.\n\nI moved from Tucson to Lake Havasu and my little radio shack 12-470 seems to be having a hard time picking up signals where we live. The big stereo in the living room picks up stations fine tho I dont think the bf would like if I &quot;hacked&quot; it LOL.  \n\nSo my question is, Is there something I could do to boost this little ratshacks ability to pick up signals(theres no external antenna jack) or should i just try to save up for a newer better model?  Ive been trying for months to record but no go really. I do know they are there cuz i can hear em but it takes like 5 mins(or more) for a complete sentence. i think its frustrating both sides lol.\nThanks!\nRhonda"}
