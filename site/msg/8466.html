&gt; Hi Rees. I&#x27;m at http://www.ITCdeadpeople.com
&gt; 
&gt; It&#x27;s a super simple site. Just five pages. But page one has a link to some
&gt; of my EVP which I 
&gt; posted on putfile. And page two has several links: one for instructions on
&gt; the water video 
&gt; ITC technique, one to a Maury segment on youtube where some of my material
&gt; was used 
&gt; (thanks for posting that, Debbie!), and a couple collages of the crystal
&gt; images.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you like it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Margaret

&gt; &gt; Hi Misty. I was surprised at how much smaller my files became when I
&gt; changed 
&gt; my 
&gt; &gt; settings in Audacity to 16-bit MONO with an 11025Hz sample rate. I figure
&gt; this is voice 
&gt; &gt; we are recording, not the symphony. And in my case, I&#x27;m not doing any kind
&gt; of 
&gt; frequency 
&gt; &gt; analysis, or anything else that requires super high quality files. Files,
&gt; in almost all cases, 
&gt; &gt; really do not need to be 32-bit stereo with a 44100Hz sample rate. But I
&gt; know how 
&gt; hard 
&gt; &gt; it can be to convince some people of this.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I do save my individual raw files on my drive in WAV format. But if I&#x27;m
&gt; going to post, I 
&gt; &gt; create an MP3. Even my WAV files are small though. Just took a look, and
&gt; with my 
&gt; &gt; settings, a short WAV file runs about 88kb. Converted to MP3 it becomes
&gt; just 16kb. I 
&gt; &gt; have one that is 248kb in the raw, but after editing out unrelated content
&gt; and exporting 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; MP3, it was just 24kb. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If people would just record with the lower settings to begin with, I think
&gt; they would be 
&gt; &gt; surprised at the amount of quality which remains... not to discount how
&gt; much of their 
&gt; own 
&gt; &gt; hard drive space will be saved. I know a 1MB WAV file with the high
&gt; settings becomes 
&gt; just 
&gt; &gt; 20kb in MP3 format with the lower settings. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I visit another forum where the max file size for a single submission is
&gt; 150kb. A person 
&gt; is 
&gt; &gt; physically unable to upload any file larger than that. People have changed
&gt; to the lower 
&gt; &gt; settings in order to meet the file size restriction, and I can tell you
&gt; that plenty of 
&gt; members 
&gt; &gt; post, and plenty of others hear and understand their examples just fine.
&gt; Hopefully some 
&gt; of 
&gt; &gt; the members here will give the lower settings a try. :0)

&gt; &gt; &gt; You guys really do have to start using mp3 versions tho we are at 90%
&gt; full again so its 
&gt; &gt; going to come down to either some people wont be allowed to post files if
&gt; they cant 
&gt; make 
&gt; &gt; the transition, or all files will have to be deleted, or nobody will be
&gt; able to post at all 
&gt; &gt; because there will be no space left.
