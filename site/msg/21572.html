Hi,
I don't remember much about 2012 from my visions but I do believe the w=
orld will 
continue. It is just the hurricanes, earthquakes, tidal waves, a=
nd that sort of 
thing is what people will think about. I think it's=C2=A0b=
ecause of the technology of 
web cams and=C2=A0the Internet will show us mu=
ch more than the past news we received 
about that bad stuff.=C2=A0Which is=
=C2=A0what I believe the war on terror is actually 
about.
For your 2012 qu=
estion I asked Tarot: 
It' is the 4 of cups!
We are receiving but we are no=
t happy.
http://www.kufty.com/tarot/fours.htm
I am just seeing these cups o=
f love( EVP trophies) in front of you.=C2=A0More 
EVPs=C2=A0are offer to yo=
u, but...
Apathy, Boredom, Re- evaluation, Hope, Day Dreaming, Self- Absorb=
ed, 
Disillusioned, is what tarot shows me about you=C2=A0 from the boxes a=
nd the news.
Any question for me as a psychic, love/money/career questions =
I'll answer. Just 
send them to my e-mail.
