Thanks for that Misty.=A0=A0 I'm grasping for help here.=A0 Since my radio =

 station" spot.=A0 I will try around the frequencies you mentioned to start=
 with.=A0=A0 Thanks again=A0=A0 ron

Hiya Ron

No=
pe didnt miss anything. Good question. Last time I was using AM frequency w=
as somewhere around 550-580 (not digital so cant tell ya exactly where it i=
s/was). The night before it was between 850-1000 closer to the 900 mark. No=
t sure whats better. I would just try a few spots where nothings coming thr=
u but the sound of the air waves or radio hum/buzz. Thats all I heard live =
anyway.

I remember reading about other people getting contacts with an old=
 tube radio and tuning to a section that it sounded like ocean waves... I d=
idnt hear ocean waves but I guess the whooshing noise/static could be consi=
dered as such. It just wasnt a constant sound on mine as it was on theres. =
Just the hum of the radios power being on was the only contstant I noticed =
in both sessions. Perhaps why I hear nothing live but they all could?? No c=
lue so I wont pretend to understand it anymore than the sweep files I get. =
They did voice having some difficulty on the lower freq.
