The\n&gt; file I posted was compressed for space saving, but from my initial\n&gt; question I shaved several seconds off between the &#39;yes my actual name&#39;\n&gt; and the &#39;andy...mike&#39; . total clip time before compression was about 10\n&gt; seconds. Still pretty new at this, so hearing my first and middle name\n&gt; repeated back to me takes some getting used to, but very exciting.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Andy\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
