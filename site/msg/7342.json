If ghosts are coming through the box \nand thus are not in a good state of mind, how come on Paranormal \nState CM was willing to believe the message given by the ghost via \nthe box as being truth (The ghost via the box said a &quot;demon&quot; was \nholding the ghosts captive there)? \n\nI would suggest that perhaps a ghost (assuming we are talking about a \ndisembodied person who remains earthbound) is not in a healthy state \nof mind one would consider &quot;stable,&quot; but trapped in emotional trauma \nof some sort.
