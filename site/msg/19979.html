well I was just asking cause I never seen it before...but you do know you c=
an get evp from ANY recording device..well I do,but people does say that's =
not normal lol..I mean i get evp through computers,recorders,my phone memo,=
 or even my kids play recordings. this happens when I'm not even thinking a=
bout it sometime is annoying when I'm trying to record something and get no=
t just a moan but sentences..usually asking for help or just letting me kno=
w they can see me..
=C2=A0
Now with saying that I love my boxes and I get a=
mazing results form those to. I was saying not sure if you need "anomalies,=
 fluctuations and variable conditions" that your speaking of...well at leas=
t I don't..
