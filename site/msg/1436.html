<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks so much, Frank.  I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of good feedback 
about the articles from a variety of places.  The issue they are in 
was very well received last weekend at a TAPS haunted weekend event 
at Eastern State Penitentiary in Philly.

I am happy to say that I am now the owner of a Frank&#x27;s box myself, 
no. 22, which has random, linear and manual sweep.  I have thanked 
Frank profusely!  I took it to Eastern State -- not to use in the 
haunting investigation -- but because Bill Murphy and Randy Schneider 
were there, too, and I wanted them to &quot;imprint&quot; the box with me 
before I initiate it into use. We meditated and set intention for the 
research to be of the highest purpose, and to be assisted by helpful 
entities who desire to establish the transdimensional bridges.

I have been conditioning environment and consciousness with Jonathan 
Goldman&#x27;s &quot;Holy Harmony&quot; CD, a wonderful 72 min. of continuous chant 
&amp; sound with the ancient 9-note scale.  His work is at 
http://www.healingsounds.com.  I have always liked Goldman.

&gt; Yeah Steve, I&#x27;m not real vocal to begin with but it has been
&gt; abnormally slow. I think everyone is real busy getting their ducks 
in
&gt; a row for the upcoming holiday.  Who knows? LOL 
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, Rosemary wrote the articles for TAPS mag and its probably one 
of
&gt; the best portrayals of the Frank&#x27;s box there is. At least Rosemary
&gt; actually spoke with, witnessed and interviewed people who know a
&gt; little about this machine, to include Frank himself. Its nice to 
read
&gt; a positive, informed account rather than the guessing and stabbing 
in
&gt; the dark I have heard and written by ignorant naysayers.
&gt; 
&gt; Kudos Rosemary!

&gt; &gt; This is an incredible field and nobody has posted in days.  Just 
&gt; &gt; thought i&#x27;d throw it out there and maybe get somebody&#x27;s 
attention.  
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ll have to post more files i guess to keep this going.  The box 
was 
&gt; &gt; in TAPS paramag, anybody read that?
