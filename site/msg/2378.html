 A replacement for #13, which was rendered FUBAR(f'ed up beyond all repair=
). I made this different, for one thing working right to left, backwards co=
mpared to what I usually do. I used extra large gain caps for the white noi=
se so as to get as much low frequency gain as possible. After running a cab=
le directly to the circuit for the RVG rate I decided I wanted all other ca=
bles (except volume controls) to be connected via terminal strips. It makes=
 wire replacement much easier. It's mulitmode as well, AM/FM, linear and ra=
ndom scan, stereo inputs and outputs. The board is about 6 inches sqaure, a=
nd a printed board using all through hole components would be about the sam=
e size, but cost close to $300 plus parts.  Most seem to think I have nothi=
ng else to do but build boards. It's extremely time consumming, and I have =
no time to run my own recording sessions, nor spend any time with the Ol' L=
ady, the grandkids, or the dogs. Everything around me gets neglected for th=
is 'art', and much of the time I resent it. It's a joy to get the voices, a=
nd even as I get each stage working on a board, but it's tedious, and time =
consumming. So as I rip someone's head off for demanding I make more, keep =
this in mind.
