Last night I asked who was speaking using the EVP \nMaker and SJ Allophones combo, and received the direct answer, &quot;Arthur.&quot;  That&#39;s a bit short \nfor my preference, as I like to rule out coincidence, but there was a followup statement made \nin the same session which surprised me, &quot;Arthur can help you.&quot;  \n\nI think when using sweep and similar techniques that relevance to session content is really \nimportant as an aid in ruling our false positives, so this followup comment helped sway me \ntoward the possibility of this having been intentional communication.  \n\nIt&#39;s been fascinating to work with this combination the last couple of days!\n\nMargaret"}
