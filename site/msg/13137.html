<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for replying to my message.

Years ago I watched a slide show featuring several photo&#x27;s taken via
kirlian photography. It seems kirlian photography captures certain
types of energy on film. In the demonstration a picture of a house was
shown. Later that same house had a fire and part of the house had been
burned to the ground but the photo taken with kirlian photography
later showed that part of the house still there.

I&#x27;m no expert but maybe energy we can&#x27;t see leaves an imprint in the
non physical universe and can be viewed or demonstrated using the
right instruments and technique. Of course I really have no clue and
am fascinated by the evp and itc phenomena.

Enjoyed visiting your site, thanks for the link.

&gt; Hi Richard, and welcome to the group. I am not on here much as I
&gt; usually just read the posts and contribute when I can. I am very busy
&gt; with my group so balancing my time isn&#x27;t easy.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess as of now it is hard to say whether or not an EVP is from a
&gt; &quot;living&quot; entity or just a sound bit floating in time. All we can do is
&gt; speculate on such matters, really. I think that time may lead to
&gt; finite answers to our questions, but as it stands with our limited
&gt; equipment and devices we use to measure phenomenon, we cannot say 100%
&gt; for certain. I have my theories, as does everyone.
&gt; 
&gt; That being said, my personal belief is that EVP and ITC can be both.
&gt; Though my research has been much more focused on EVP and recently, on
&gt; the Radio Shack hack box, I have seen what I believe to be evidence of
&gt; both. I have many EVPs recorded that seem to suggest both &quot;living&quot;
&gt; entities and those that suggest residual phenomenon, or &quot;residue&quot; of
&gt; things in the past.
&gt; 
&gt; One example is the EVP I captured at the Camp Creek Trustle in
&gt; McDonough, GA. In the EVP, the voice picked up seems to suggest that
&gt; he is not dead. Tou can check this file out in my folder here. Also,
&gt; at the investigation of the trustle, EVPs were picked up seeming to
&gt; answer questions. For example, when I asked what kind of music was
&gt; enjoyed by the entity, I received &quot;orcha&quot; as an response. I took this
&gt; to be an attempt to say &quot;orchestra,&quot; a popular music choice from the
&gt; early 1900&#x27;s when so many lives were lost at this spot. As for the
&gt; Radio Shack hack, just last night I was again at the trustle
&gt; conducting a hack box session. When we asked about which of us were in
&gt; attendance, the answer came back very clearly with two of our names,
&gt; &quot;Nate&quot; and &quot;Chad.&quot; These were very clear and in an area where radio
&gt; reception is not that great.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps one of our more compelling EVPs as they relate to whether or
&gt; not these are &quot;living&quot; entities we are communicating with is one that
&gt; we recorded in the White House located in McDonough, GA. A team member
&gt; was talking about someone and how poorly they kept up their yard when
&gt; we picked up a very clear voice saying &quot;You are so mean.&quot; On the same
&gt; investigation we captured a voice talking about Kurt, another
&gt; investigator and how he was stupid.
&gt; 
&gt; Now to the other side of the coin. We have picked up &quot;EVPs&quot; of things
&gt; such as gunshots and cannon fire at civil war battlefields we have
&gt; visited. These appear at first to be residual sounds, yet other
&gt; aspects of the investigation seem to provide proof of intelligent
&gt; entities. Perhaps the soldiers who died in that battle are still
&gt; fighting. We cannot really say based on only the EVPs taken during
&gt; those investigations. We do have other evidence, but I will not go
&gt; into that here as this is an EVP/ITC group.
&gt; 
&gt; Feel free to take a look at our group&#x27;s site.

&gt; 
&gt; I am happy to send our files to anyone for research purposes if
requested.
&gt; 
&gt; I am sure that many of the members of the group will give you their
&gt; theories as well on this matter, and I&#x27;m sure that as you begin to
&gt; experiment on your own that many fascinating and unexplained events
&gt; will present themselves to you. Good luck, and again, welcome to the
&gt; group.
