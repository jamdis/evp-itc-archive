Amy,
It can be done, yes!! But you must be careful, that you know who you a=
re talking to, not someone pretending to be who you want to hear from.  I'v=
e also had people in spirit speak for them. It'll be "so and so says-blah b=
lah blah"   I have heard from family members (My dad, Grandma, Uncle Mike, =
and Great Grandma Sylvia). Just be careful because it's not all "I love you=
" from them lol.

Concentrate on who you want to speak to.  Say aloud your =
intention and the time you will be recording (its' like sending out an invi=
tation).  If they don't come the first time keep trying. 

If you meditate,=
 this is also a good time to meditate to get your energy up. I found if I m=
editate for even 10 min before I record that the messages are clearer.
