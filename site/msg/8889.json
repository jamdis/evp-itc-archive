One\ncould test this by trying to form speech by manually assembling some of\nthese remaining allophones using Audition&#39;s play list. Probably this\nwould be much more difficult than with the full set of 72 allophones.\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\nam 04.04.2008 um 02:52 Uhr schriebst Du (u.a.):\nam 04.04.2008 um 02:52 Uhr schrieben Sie (u.a.):\n\n&gt; Hi Stefan.  I&#39;m thinking too much has been cut from this one.  Ran a couple sessions with \n&gt; it.  I&#39;m not getting anything (not that I get something every time with the other 72- but \n&gt; nothing sounds even remotely like word formation with the 56 file.)\n\n&gt; Margaret"}
