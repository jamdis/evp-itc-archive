<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce,

It&#x27;s going to take a major change for harmony, peace and elevated 
mindset to occur in mankind...major perspective change for sure.  
That will demand some catalyst to unite- transform minds IMHO.

&gt; LC,
&gt;  
&gt; In my opinion what our friends mean by the messages
&gt; of &quot;no more time&quot; or &quot;time running out&quot; Is meant 
&gt; as a warning to mankind that if we do not change and realise that 
life 
&gt; and mother earth are precious, and how to live together
&gt; in &quot;harmony&quot; we are doomed to extinction.
&gt;  
&gt; The sense of urgency I believe is meant to make us understand that 
global tensions 
&gt; at this time could very well bring about this destruction, If 
someone decides to turn left instead of right.
&gt;  
&gt; That&#x27;s my take on these type of messages, and I get at least one 
every couple of sessions.

&gt; Nice, interesting files, Bruce. You and FS (his post today) got me 
wondering about this time no more thing...not to mention I heard 
similar statements of urgency over my RS box set-up, too. Any more 
ideas regarding this, Bruce...FS...others? I personally believe time 
to be illusion, and I also know it is written &quot;time will be no more&quot; 
(biblical future prophecy).Still not sure where I fall with this, 
other than I do agree on this urgency, elevating consciousness, etc

some new Frank&#x27;s box files. You may find the ones about sweep &gt; rate 
interesting.&gt; &gt; There are quite a few good ones, New researchers 
please take note of &gt; the different sound between Frank&#x27;s box and the 
RS boxes. The operation &gt; of the box and the sound and files it 
produces are very unique to each &gt; FB.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt;
