I was just\ncurious as to where you got the inspiration for the box. \n\nWas it just an idea that popped into your head or did you have help\nfrom the other side?  Not to take any credit away from you at all with\nyour accomplishments with the box. It was just something I was curious\nabout.\n\nI believe I am looking for personal answers from the other side but\nalso I feel it may help me with some more general directions I may\nwant to go in after putting my own personal demons to rest. \n\nThanks for your time in advance.\n\nRegards,\nTT"}
