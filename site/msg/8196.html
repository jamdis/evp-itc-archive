I agree with that, the fact that i get that # every session is just 
another thing that fascinates me about this research.  I have yet to 
get a direct response on the meaning, maybe they are not ready to say 
what it is just yet.  I just randomly search for the meaning of the 
number 7 and see if anything makes sense, while i wait for them to 
tell me what is their meaning behind it.

&gt; Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for posting this as it gives more food for thought on Seven.
&gt; It&#x27;s been astounding how it seems to have been consistent for so 
many
&gt; to be getting that number. It&#x27;s still a mystery as there is little
&gt; besides that number that has been spoken so it&#x27;s been out of 
context.

&gt; &gt; &gt;  7.      Seven represents the enlightened person, full special 
&gt; &gt; &gt; orientation, awareness of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; manifestation. Seven represents perfect groupings, fullness of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; planetary and angelic 
&gt; &gt; &gt; orders. Seven symbolizes perfection of order, energies and 
&gt; &gt; spiritual 
&gt; &gt; &gt; principals. Seven 
&gt; &gt; &gt; represents eternal life and the perfection of a complete cycle. 
It 
&gt; &gt; &gt; symbolizes a fresh start 
&gt; &gt; &gt; after a cycle has been completed and positive regeneration. 
Seven 
&gt; &gt; is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the fullness of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; space and time and the fullness of the universe in motions. 
Through 
&gt; &gt; &gt; its hidden 
&gt; &gt; &gt; properties, the number seven maintained all things in being, 
&gt; &gt; mundane 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and spiritual, and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; bestowed life. Seven is the number of crowning achievement.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; A modern interpretation of the number seven affirms that you 
are on 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the right spiritual 
&gt; &gt; &gt; path and that what you are working on creating is very close to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; coming into being.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This seems to make the most sense to me so far about the #7 
some of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; us have been getting.
