Hi Margaret,
 
What I meant was, through all of us doing research, someone=
 or a number of us are bound to receive
a message or messages that will exp=
lain what and if there is an explanation for the tech turmoil some
have bee=
n experiencing including myself. And that the answers and or messages will =
most likely be recorded 
by the researchers so we can collaborate them and =
come up with a generally accepted theory.

Hi Bruce. The reason I asked about the techs is, my normal guys are=
 David & Patrick, and a woman whose name I've never been told. They come th=
rough on the MiniBox or manual radio sweep. It seems I have a different tec=
h group (five people) when I work with more traditional EVP methods, which =
I discovered nearly three years ago. I thought it interesting to have someo=
ne named Arthur come through via EVPM, as the name is new to me. I've long =
suspected that perhaps different groups assist with different technologies.=
 For instance, I have one team that seems to be unique to my work with ligh=
