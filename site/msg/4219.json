Lookin&#39; good!\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Ratka &lt;warrior18eii@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; You really need to look at this from a different perspective. We \nneed to get away from the erroneous concept of duality. Instead of \npolarizing factions like good and evil or light and dark, there is \nonly shades of gray. There are no two terminal ends of the scale as \nwe picture it. The fact is there is only the scale, which slides to \ninfinity in all directions and is defined by vibration and density. \nPositive and negative ideals and attitudes determine where on the \nscale you fit and what entities of like characteristics fits with \nyou. These are comfort zones!\n&gt; \n&gt; As human beings we have a tendency to judge things in terms of \nultimates. It seems we can only understand concepts if they have a \nultimate, clearly defined top or bottom. These concepts have always \nserved us well here on Earth. They have allowed us to define our \nreality where most everyone can understand it in one capacity or \nanother. In the reality outside of our bubble, the greater reality if \nyou will there are no ultimates or ends. \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank R.\n&gt;"}
