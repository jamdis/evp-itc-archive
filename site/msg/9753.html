<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>A man after my own heart, Frank! Others may have their own thoughts and 
beliefs, but I&#x27;m with you on that.

I&#x27;ve never personally been harmed by a ghost either. Heck, they usually 
don&#x27;t even drain my batteries when they do that to others on an

&gt;  That thing aobut Spiricom, I don&#x27;t believe that! It&#x27;s that same crap
