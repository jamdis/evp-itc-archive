And the other one \ntalks about how pretty it is there and i always get &quot;Hi&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m \nHere&quot; as well as &quot;Don&#39;t leave&quot; when i&#39;m signing off and an \noccasional &quot;Goodbye&quot;.  Has anyone experienced anything like this \nbefore?  The 1 box even shuts off appliances in my house when i use \nit, i guess i&#39;ll stop using that one for now until i figure out a \nsolution to what&#39;s going on.  Any ideas?????\n\n-Steve H."}
