I did a session yesterday, and as everyone knows, I get the worst reception out in the country.  As I was turning in Frank's Box, I could hear the voices coming through, but they were not very clear.
   
  I asked them if they thought I should switch boxes for better reception, and oviously Frank's Box just happens to be their favorite!
   
  Enjoy!
   
  Juli
