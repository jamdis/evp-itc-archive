It made from Bakelite, even the stick plate is. I still need\n&gt;to wire it up so I just placed the components on the still unassembled\n&gt;board and uploaded a pic in my photo album on this forum. The stick\n&gt;plate is also made of Bakelite but I placed a small plastic square\n&gt;where the stick pad goes. My crazy plane was to adapt it to the tuning\n&gt;mechanism of Frank&#39;s Box to allow an intuitive tactile feedback\n&gt;interface so I could try to find the frequencies where spirits contact\n&gt;us.\n&gt;\n&gt;Sort of like the manual linear sweep but with a stick pad added. These\n&gt;3 dial machines are still available from Bill Jensen out of Knoxville\n&gt;TN who makes them to original spec except with modern internal\n&gt;circuitry. -Bill Murphy\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Mon, 16 Jul 2007, Frank Sumption wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This time I made a small plastic echo box. I tried plastic years\n&gt;ago, and it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t work, this time it seems to. The injection speaker accounts\n&gt;for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weaker voices I think, since it&#39;s an ear bud, and is 32 ohm,\n&gt;normal speakers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are 8 ohms. More voices are in my folder.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are so many different types of plastics with so many different\n&gt; &gt; characteristics ... ABS plastic, PVC, Delrin, acrylic, PTFE (teflon),\n&gt; &gt; Cyrolon ZX ...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It might be interesting to experiment with different types and see what\n&gt; &gt; works the best.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyone here ever build a Hieronymus machine?  I understand teflon (or\n&gt; &gt; fiberglass-teflon PC board material) works incredibly well for the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;stick&quot; sensor plate.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Zack\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nNeed a brain boost?
