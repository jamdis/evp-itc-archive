From what you've posted so far, it sounds like an interesting effort, and I=
 look forward to reading the entire study.

Also, from what you posted, it =
did not say they didn't use double-blind testing. It says one of the reason=
s they do not consider the current radio-sweep claims reliable, is that tho=
se making those claims do not do double blind tests.=C2=A0 

So if you are =
calling BS and clueless those who are not doing double blind testing, that =
begs the question - are you?
