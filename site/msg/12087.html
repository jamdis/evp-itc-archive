Using the Trutech boombox wiht the single ended sweep board installed, and=
 the tape deck set up near the speakers for open air recording. I have a yo=
unger brother that actually legally changed his name to James Bond, but I d=
on't know his e-mail address. He did that just so he could say "Bond--James=
 Bond" :-}
 
 I don't remember if I posted anything about the new system, u=
sing a single 12 volt supply instead of the plus and minus supplies I've be=
en using. It has only one draw back, the tone circuit won't work single end=
