Generally, voice recognition software requires the user to go through sever=
al training phases with it before using it, so the software is able to reco=
gnize that particular users words (unless it is a VERY limited set of words=

it has never heard.=A0=A0 The software would make a lot of mistakes, and pe=
rhaps even be subject to paradolia, just like people.
