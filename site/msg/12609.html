  File        : /Margaret Downey/ADS Tech Instant FM Device/IKnowYou.mp3 
  Uploaded by : itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; 
  Description : Installed the ADS Tech Instant FM device on my XP computer yesterday.  Used the Snaptune One s/w to do a manual sweep and connected with one of my techs.  After I say his name, I&#x27;m hearing, &quot;I KNOW YOU.&quot; Also, sounds &#x27;sort of&#x27; like my name being said right after I say, &quot;David?&quot;  Raw clip.
