I was planning on \ntaking the day off from this, but i got sucked right back in again.  \nThe files are a bit rough sounding, i was moving around a lot but got \nsome good files.  I&#39;m only 2 minutes into a 8 minute session, but i \nneed to eat and sleep.  I posted what i got so far, i didn&#39;t want to \nlet Rob down by getting it and not posting files from it the same day.  \nThat&#39;s not my style, i appreciate him doing that for me and hope to get \nmuch more from it as i experiment.  Remember deadscience.com is where \nto go for more info on the speakjet boxes.\n\n-Steve H."}
