I would appreciate the imput from those who are serious \n&gt; about the research here.  Many of the serious researchers have \nspent \n&gt; years, and countless hours a day testing these lines of \ncommunication.  \n&gt; I for one refuse to allow the negitive get to me and will continue \nto \n&gt; work either independently or with my fellow colleages who truly \nrespect \n&gt; each other and their contributions in this area.\n&gt; \n&gt;         So with that being said, I hope you enjoy the audio clips.  \n&gt; They are from a Joe&#39;s Box session.\n&gt; \n&gt;         In addition, I have introduced several new researchers to \nthe \n&gt; RS hacked in hopes that their their future studies will add in our \nup \n&gt; hill climb in pursuing what we started.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Juli\n&gt;"}
