I can understand your frustration with what&#39;s happened\n(that someone would put you in that position with your job is hard to\nbelieve!)  You began this fascinating leap into whatever realm this is and\nyou most probably understand it better than anyone else.\n\nYour contributions are very important to me, and it seems like many others\nin this group, as well as those of the other people with a high level of\nexperience, and the ideas and contributions so many others have made or will\nmake.  The &quot;paranormal field&quot; can&#39;t just stop at a comfortable, accepted\npoint, with just human spirits defined and packaged, as Draiga pointed out.\n There&#39;s too much out there to explore and if anything discovered is &quot;real&quot;\nI think we had better know that.  Though I have to admit that I may never\nfully understand what/who &quot;they&quot; are unless they come and talk to me in\nperson and fill me in.  And I really hope &quot;your guys&quot; are just messing with\nus :), though I have my doubts sometimes with all of this education I&#39;m\ngetting about &quot;sustainable management of the planet for the survival of the\nhuman species&quot;, when we don&#39;t even know what we have messed up fully or how\nto fix it.\n\nOk, enough off topic stuff.  I&#39;m so glad your still here!\n\n- Adrienne\n\n\nOn Mon, Jan 3, 2011 at 7:57 PM, purplespacefriend &lt;purplealiengirl@...\n&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t take my moody BS personally.

Due to one of these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; incessent argurments, I had to back away from this some years ago as I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; almost got fired becuase yet someone else that thought they knew so\n&gt; much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more forwarded all my e-mails to my boss.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then someone else seemed to be insinuating that I may have tampered\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the imgaes. Very insulting. This stuff goes on an on, regardless of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quality of voices, or the images. I have reached my saturation point.\n&gt; There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seems to be nothing more to be gained by presenting anything else. Now,\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can sympatize with Richard Roberts!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The group will continue, as there are a number of box and paranormal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experts here that are more than happy to tell everyone what this stuff\n&gt; &gt; &gt; really is and how it works.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t mean to create bad any feelings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; F-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;EVP-ITC%\n&gt; 40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Adrienne&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;abortree@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for getting back to me.
