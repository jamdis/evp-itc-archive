<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello,
This is my first post to the group.  My name is Ursula, and I am a 
Chicago-based writer who has written a number of books on Chicago&#x27;s 
supernatural history and folklore. I just started a regular program 
of ITC experimentation a week ago today, after receiving several 
books from Mark Macy after he spoke at our Chicago Ghost Conference 
in October.  Macy immediately struck me as an intensely sincere, 
peaceful person, and I wanted some of what made him that way.  I soon 
found out that his demeanor flows from his connection to and 
knowledge of the other side, which he has garnered through ITC.  With 
Mark&#x27;s advice to guide me, I put together a very simple setup and 
began recording for about ten minutes each morning at eleven.  I got 
my first voice on Wednesday and, though it was a bit chilling, I was 
and am fascinated. This was a huge step for me because, like a lot 
of &quot;ghost hunters&quot; I was fascinated by voice phenomena but never 
wanted it in my own house!  Previously, the thought of recording in 
my own home was terrifying, but now that I understand the bridge-
building idea of ITC (as a separate thing from recording EVP at 
haunted sites)it&#x27;s actually bringing me a lot of peace and focus.

My husband and I operate Chicago Hauntings tours, and we started our 
company in part to try to &quot;un-haunt&quot; some of the tragic sites in the 
city. We feel that by taking guests to the locations to tell the 
often covered-up stories of the dead there we can help send on some 
of the negative energies/entities.  ITC seems to really speak to this 
idea, in the way that it helps us all grow spiritually BEFORE we pass 
over, so that we don&#x27;t get &quot;left behind&quot; here when it&#x27;s time to 
transition.

Anyway, those are some of the inital feelings and thoughts I have as 
I start this program.  I am eager to pick up feelings, thoughts (and 
tips) from other experimenters.  Thanks again for having me!</pre>
