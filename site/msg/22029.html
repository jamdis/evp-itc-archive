&gt; Hello everyone! My name is Beth and I am new to this group! Thank you to the
&gt; owners/moderators who approved my membership! I was looking for a group of
&gt; paranormal investigators who enjoy talking about the paranormal as much as I
&gt; do. My family and friends seem to be sick of me talking about it and
&gt; whenever I mention something that I&#x27;ve captured I get the roll of the eyes.
&gt; Lol! 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ve always been interested in ghost and ghost hunting. When I was little my
&gt; mother would tell me that she would always hear boxes being thrown around in
&gt; the basement and thought it to be a ghost. She also said that she would hear
&gt; footsteps and feet being dragged across the long plastic runner that we had
&gt; in front of the basement door. She would get up thinking it was one of us
&gt; kids and we would be sound asleep. So, naturally my interest grew. I never
&gt; seen anything unusual but I would always &#x27;feel&#x27; something in that house.
&gt; When I got older, married, and had my own kids I lived in a questionable
&gt; house for 11 years. We would hear footsteps in the attic, the kids would
&gt; complain of seeing &#x27;uncle Sam&#x27; standing in the bathroom doorway, or a man
&gt; walking through the bedroom. Of course I never believed them. I asked my son
&gt; when he got older and he remembered the man in great detail. Turns out it
&gt; was a man/spirit in period clothing with a long white beard and top hat.
&gt; Hence the &#x27;uncle Sam&#x27; character. I have seen a female child apparition
&gt; standing in the doorway to which I had a witness, my sister-in-law who saw
&gt; the same thing at the same time. We thought it was one of our kids and
&gt; quickly counted heads and it wasn&#x27;t one of our own. The apparition vanished
&gt; and we never saw it again. I have heard music playing in the basement and a
&gt; man coughing when I&#x27;ve been home alone. A roommate of mine had her shirt
&gt; tugged on and she thought it was me but I wasn&#x27;t home from work yet. She
&gt; locked herself in her room, scared to death until I came home. The stories
&gt; go on and on. 
&gt; 
&gt; I moved from that home and now I am having strange things occur in this
&gt; house. I should note that I am over a thousand miles from my previous 
&gt; haunted&#x27; home. I&#x27;ve lived here 4 yrs and one day I seen a little ball of
&gt; light (ORB) shoot out of my bedroom and go into my husband&#x27;s chair. I have
&gt; seen a few shadows and have felt that creepy feeling where my hair stands on
&gt; end many times. So, I decided to get a digital recorder. Not thinking that I
&gt; would ever capture anything. I also wanted to use it to debunk EVPs and find
&gt; some Scientific explanation for them. I was wrong. I captured my first EVP
&gt; in the master bedroom of my home. It said, &quot;I have no love&quot;. Ok, that got my
&gt; attention. I tried to debunk it and could not. I decided to perform many EVP
&gt; sessions in my bedroom and have caught a lot of them. I have asked questions
&gt; and ask to knock for yes to certain questions. By doing so I figured out
&gt; that it was a Hispanic woman who had been murdered. After some research I
&gt; have since found out that yes someone had died in this house. One of the
&gt; previous tenants claimed there was a ghost here and even went so far as to
&gt; get the house cleansed. I must have brought it back by summoning it while
&gt; conducting my EVP sessions. 
&gt; 
&gt; My fascination grew now that I was actually capturing real evidence. I have
&gt; since went on tours of supposedly haunted places such as: Vulture Mine,
&gt; Arizona, The Bird Cage Theatre Tombstone, Arizona, the San Carlos Hotel,
&gt; Phoenix, and Goldfield Ghost Town, Arizona. I am new at this so I haven&#x27;t
&gt; been on any investigations on a team. I do it alone. The only equipment that
&gt; I&#x27;ve been using is a digital camera and recorder. My main interest is
&gt; capturing something paranormal on film or EVPs. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have recently made a couple of trips to a local cemetery, during the day,
&gt; middle of the afternoon and have caught amazing EVPs. I have captured many
&gt; different voices and personalities. Some nice, some not so nice. Some women,
&gt; men, and children. It amazes me because I cannot debunk them. I know for a
&gt; fact that I&#x27;m the only one there so they can&#x27;t be explained. I know it wasn
&gt; t me who I was hearing, so who is it? I&#x27;m not sure if ghosts really exist or
&gt; if they are all residual energy. Since capturing the voices actually
&gt; answering my questions I am leaning toward that they really exist. There&#x27;s
&gt; just no denying. I now believe that some are residual and some are
&gt; intelligent spirits. I enjoy EVPs because they are much harder to debunk.
&gt; With photographs there is always that &#x27;what if&#x27; or well it could be a glare
&gt; or a glitch in the camera. But with EVPs they are unmistakable. 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m looking forward with getting to know everyone and sharing my experiences
&gt;
