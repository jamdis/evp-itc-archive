<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Try to be gentle with yourself, Rees.  I have to admit though, I can certainly relate to the 
self butt-kicking ... been there, done that!!  ;-)  The BEST part is, you were there 
witnessing the communication and it had a profound impact on you.  That&#x27;s sacred, even if 
there is no recording.  I&#x27;m happy for you that you were able to have this experience (and I 
share in your disappointment about the recording - because I can imagine how I would 
feel in your shoes).  Here&#x27;s to next time!

to get it back, but with no sucess

Most of us computer users know the golden rule 
&gt; (besides BACKUP) is to save your session immediately so that if anything strange 
happens, 
&gt; it will have been stored on the hard drive. LOL - I should talk! - I&#x27;ve lost more than a 
few 
&gt; sessions by ignoring this sage advice in the past, but nothing so spectacular as you 
&gt; describe. I record into my laptop too, with Audacity. 
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you have success tonight, and if you do, take two seconds to &#x27;save&#x27; your file the 
&gt; moment the session ends. Keep us posted!

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m guessing nobody believes me! O well I would like to tell you that it really is true, 
and 
&gt; I know in my heart, because I was there. Not sure why them cpu went off, but maybe I 
&gt; had too much infomation then they wanted me too.( I record write on to my laptop, and 
I 
&gt; don&#x27;t use any type of digital or analog recorder). I will prove it again. Tonight I am going 
&gt; to do everything the same to see if I can get it to happen again.

&gt; &gt; Hey guys
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I had the most amazing session last night. Me and my fiance 
&gt; &gt; did a session, and this is how it went. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We usally do 10 min. of audio, and during the session we first 
&gt; &gt; contacted a guy named Virgil, and we got him to say both of our 
&gt; &gt; names. He said &quot;William&quot; for me, and &quot;Leigh&quot; for Ashley. We all 
&gt; &gt; communicated for the 10 min. He didn&#x27;t answer every question, but 
&gt; &gt; he answered 75% of all answerslast night. We told him that we 
&gt; &gt; wanted to prove that they exsisted on the other side. Life after 
&gt; &gt; death. He answer &quot;we are over here&quot;, very plainly. After the 10 
&gt; &gt; min. We ask for confirmation so we could shut off the radio, and we 
&gt; &gt; got this answer &quot;that would be a bad idea&quot;. Which freaked Ashley 
&gt; &gt; out. So we kept the radio on and we had a conversation with this 
&gt; &gt; preacher, then while the band was still sweeping the preacher came 
&gt; &gt; through and he talked to us (while sweeping the band), and started 
&gt; &gt; to preach to us about our side, and how messed up it is.(the band 
&gt; &gt; was sweeping the whole time, I never stop the band from sweeping) 
&gt; &gt; He said that we needed to pray for our enemies as well as our 
&gt; &gt; friends and families. He talked to us for 6 to eight minutes. 
&gt; &gt; Then we finished the session (Ask for confirmation)when he didn&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt; come through any more. We shut down. Then of course I get up and 
&gt; &gt; put everything back the way it is supposed to be. Leaving the 
&gt; &gt; session that we just did on the laptop. Then I went to take a 
&gt; &gt; shower, and I come back. The laptop was turned off and I lost all 
&gt; &gt; of the session. Sometimes the computer will log itself off, then 
&gt; &gt; when you get back it is exactly the was it was when you left it. 
&gt; &gt; But this wasn&#x27;t the case, some reason the laptop shut itself off, 
&gt; &gt; and we lost all of the evidence that we had. Didn&#x27;t have nothing, 
&gt; &gt; and I couldn&#x27;t believe that we lost everything. So thats why I am 
&gt; &gt; sitting here typing away about what happen last night. Instead of 
&gt; &gt; me posting files about what happen last night. I wish so bad that 
&gt; &gt; y&#x27;all would have been able to hear the communication. It was a life 
&gt; &gt; changing experience. It made me think a whole lot different about 
&gt; &gt; box research. I still can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t save it before the 
&gt; &gt; computer turned itself off. That is what happen to me last night, 
&gt; &gt; and change box research for me for the rest of my life.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks
