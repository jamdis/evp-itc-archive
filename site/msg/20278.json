Guess that&#39;s the standard answer. I do a video of frying fish while holding a ghost box and a voice over the radio just happens to talk about fish talking, just how common would that be, and what&#39;s the chances of catching that at that moment?--Skeptic idiots! Yeah, that&#39;ll make this go away.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  I was thinking about the fish talking, but I said nothing. \n&gt;  \n&gt; F-S\n&gt;"}
