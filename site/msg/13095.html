Hi Louis,

Yes, that's me. I wanted to provide people wi=
th some free ideas on 
some of the different ways to use some of the device=
s, and it grew 
from there. Some of the videos get a few more thousand view=
s than 
the others.
My next free video on Youtube will be my mini-documenta=
ry about 
attempting to contact the plane crash victims from a certain cras=
h, 
using debris from that crash, and sessions at the crash scene.
I've alr=
eady sent out debris packages to some researchers who are 
going to help. I=
 start filming that one in two weeks. 

I've listened to your internet radi=
o program a few times. Good stuff!

Have a great day,
- Mike C. (UFO Geek)
