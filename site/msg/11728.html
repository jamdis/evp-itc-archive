I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying it. You take PayPal?

Let me know.

Sent a private email, but it must have ended up as spam.

&gt; Hi Elabeth,
&gt;
&gt; You have to remember much of what the Ovilus 1 said probably ended  
&gt; up on the editing room floor.  But it does work.  I get great  
&gt; responses from mine.  The (7) different modes on it work very well.   
&gt; But if you know anyone who wants one please let me know.  I was  
&gt; informed I have to sell some of my toys to afford to buy new  
&gt; toys...LOLOL  I would sell it for $165.00 and it is in brand new  
&gt; condition and only used a few times.
