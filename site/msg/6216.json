Everything I&#39;m getting is coming  \nthrough very fast and seems to come through at the faster sweep rate.  \nI have to slow everything by about half to hear it clearly on  \nplayback. Are they pushing stuff through at the higher sweep because  \nit&#39;s more efficient for them to do it that way? Maybe they have to  \nslow things down to get to anything to us to begin with. It makes  \nsense if they are in a higher vibration than we are. Maybe the faster  \nsweep is more sympathetic to them, albeit harder on us, for two-way  \ncommunication.\n\nI don&#39;t think I made any real sense, but there you go...\n\nAnn\noy oy oy what a day\n\n\nOn Jan 24, 2008, at 10:43 AM, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com  wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC\n&gt; group.\n&gt;\n&gt; File : /*Bruce FB#12 files/36_speed up or slow sweep_THIS WILL SAVE  \n&gt; US TIME.wav\n&gt; Uploaded by : bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt;\n&gt; Description : 36_speed up or slow sweep_THIS WILL SAVE US TIME.wav\n&gt;\n&gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/%2ABruce%20FB%2312% \n&gt; 20files/36_speed%20up%20or%20slow%20sweep_THIS%20WILL%20SAVE%20US% \n&gt; 20TIME.wav\n&gt;\n&gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/ \n&gt; index.htmlfiles\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\nThis is in e es ing o me, B uce.
