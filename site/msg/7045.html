As an observer opinion, the word "lighthearted" is not a word that I would use to describe the initial post.  Knowing only briefly the history of personalities involved, it seemed like a set up.  Now that I learned who one of the referees is, it was a perfect set up.  No?  Ron L

I love the sharing of info, but have elected to post less and retire 
to reading more. :)

That said, I must agree with Ann that the initial post, though 
perhaps posted to be humorous, came off as disrespectful (in my 
opinion as a reader looking in on this forum) not only to BH but to 
FS. BH does get animated at times, but he also brings some good 
input in here, too. 

We need to learn how to get along and work together. Look at your 
initial post from someone else's point of view and unban the poor 
fella', won't ya'? ;)
