<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bill (Willy),

Very nice radio!  Expensive..??? Well, I guess that depends.  You can 
get a nice used IC R-75 for about the same price or less than a... 
ahh... &quot;Mini Box&quot;(sorry April, Ron, Rick, nothing implied there 
except a price camparison)...
That Icom R-75 would be a sweet addition to a ham shack or paranormal 
shack.. :-)  sitting right next to a Franks Box, Mini Box, Joe&#x27;s Box, 
and a couple of Radio Shack Hack&#x27;s...

- Mike

&gt; Just dug out the manual for the Icom R-75 shortwave receiver that 
has 
&gt; been in box for 2 years since I moved.  It has programable scan 
start 
&gt; and stop frequencies, and variable scan steps and speed, along with 
&gt; various modes - USB/LSB/RTTY/CW/AM/FM - AND programable wide and 
&gt; narrow filters.  All of these settings, along with AGC, ANL and 
other 
&gt; functions can be changed while the radio is scanning.  Not very 
&gt; portable and rather expensive, but it is here.  I&#x27;ve got 2 projects 
&gt; ahead of starting to fool around with this, but I imagine it could 
be 
&gt; useful in finding frequencies/modes that work.  Ideas?

&gt; &gt;  I have 49, and 31 meter shortwave bands, plus AM. The shortwave 
&gt; tuning might be tricky cuz the band width is less than half the 
size 
&gt; of the AM band, about 500 khz, so instead of tuning over a 
megahertz 
&gt; with 8 volts, you&#x27;re tuning about half that with the same tuning 
&gt; voltage. So far I only have the local oscillators working, still 
need 
&gt; the input RF amp for each band. The two cans close to the chip are 
IF 
&gt; transformers, the three on the bottom edge o fthe board is the 
local 
&gt; oscillator tank circuits.  On the highest band I&#x27;m using a red LED 
&gt; for a varactor, it has almost the perfect capacitance value. 31m on 
&gt; my Sony is 9400 khz to 9800 khz, and 49m is 5900 to 6200khz.  
Still, 
&gt; how well it works, if at all, is yet to be seen.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  I really-really need a life!
