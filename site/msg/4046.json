I had \nasked our technicians Mike and Lisa if they can bring John Lennon \nfoward to speak with me and they did.  John Lennon has been my idol \nall my life and today is the 27 year anniversary of his death.  Mike \nand Lisa work very well with me in contacting the ones i try to get \nto.  In the next post you will hear the file i got, which may be the \nbest file i ever got with any radio or box.  I asked if John was aware \nof how he died and he responded &quot;Yes, Bullet&quot;.  As everyone probably \nknows that John Lennon was shot outside his home in NYC in 1980.  I \ncan&#39;t believe that our friends on the other side are so comfortable \nwith me, that they keep exceeding my expectations of what i will hear \nthrough any of these devices.  I also have other files from this \nsession, but this was the most important one and proves that i am \nspeaking with spirits on another plane.\n\n-Steve H."}
