And I won&#39;t be saying any more than this on the subject.\n\nI just spent half an hour reading through the Amy Winehouse 4 posts  What I&#39;m not getting here is why some of these discussions devolve into attacks.  This is a forum for airing knowledge and posting GBC materials regarding EVP-ITC.  If one disagrees with another person regarding religious beliefs or postings it can be done in a way that is respectful.  What I&#39;m reading seems mostly like pent up resentment and disagreements in the form of attacks.  Constructive criticism  is a great way to air different opinions on a subjects.  Attack mode is just negative.  I may be guilty of chatting and joking around and probably shouldn&#39;t, but I am alarmed at how personal this stuff gets.\n\nI wish we could all be respectful of other&#39;s beliefs and constructive in our criticism.  This kind of attack mode stuff doesn&#39;t really seem to be doing much for the advance of EVP-ITC research though, if done in an appropriate and respectful manner, it probably would.  This is just my opinion and I&#39;m not targeting anyone in particular.\n\nPlease, try to be a little more constructive or take what you need and leave the rest.\n\nRegards,\n\nAdrienne"}
