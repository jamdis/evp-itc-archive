Some skeptics/critics never intend to \nbelieve...their mind is made up.  That&#39;s who I avoid.  Now a skeptic or \ncritic who is at least open to the possibility of communication from \nthe other side, I will point them in a direction to seek answers within \nfor themselves.  :)\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi LC,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; There will always be skeptics and critics, but one thing seems\n&gt; &gt; certain: everyone has their own time when they become open to the \n&gt; &gt; possibility of the paranormal/spiritual existing.  I just choose to \n&gt; &gt; share with those whose time has come.  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t see an skeptical/critical attitude as something negative.\n&gt; Some people just aren&#39;t &quot;believers&quot;, their intellect wants to be\n&gt; satisfied, too. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; So being skeptical/critical doesn&#39;t necessarily mean not being a\n&gt; &quot;seeker&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stefan\n&gt;"}
