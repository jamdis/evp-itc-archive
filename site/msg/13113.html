<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Interesting as well because the civil aircraft band uses AM modulation
on VHF frequencies. AM is a messy bugger, seems to bleed over
everywhere. Civil aircraft also use SSB (Sideband) on HF, but usually
only on intercontinental flights.

&gt; The place where the interference was most noticeable was at ft
mifflin - near the philly airport.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t really understand radio theory or any of that stuff, but I
wondered if that (proximity to the airport) had anything to do with it.
&gt; 
&gt; I have also noticed in certain areas a huge increase in interference
at night compared to during the day i the same location.

&gt; 
&gt; Well I was simplifying but most broadcast antennas are setup for
very little radiation directly below as well as above as it is a waste
of power.  AM *loves* to shoot straight up because of the bounce (as
you HAM guys know) but TV and FM wants as much power as possible to be
at the top for the farthest line of sight broadcast.
&gt; 
&gt; I was amazed to read that you guys got FM chatter on the recorder. 
I guess it is possible in theory but I would never had expected that.
 Just goes to show why it is all radio theory and not radio proof or
law :))  Those EM fields are tricky little buggers.

&gt; That&#x27;s only true of a simple dipole. Antennas can be engineered to get 
&gt; practically any pattern you want. In fact, many FM and TV antennas
have a 
&gt; pattern which peaks from directly below the antenna to the horizon and 
&gt; sends very little signal straight up.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, close-in you might still be in the Fresnel zone of the field.

&gt; &gt; Just an engineering point.  Radio radiates out kind of like a
donut turned on it&#x27;s side.  So directly under, up to a dozen or so
feet from a tower has zero transmission.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It kind of looks like this:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   |
&gt; &gt;  (|)
&gt; &gt; ------
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Where the parenthesis are the radio waves.  Except they do not
really get that close to the tower base.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The point of the strongest signal is a little past the height of
the tower.  So if the tower is 100&#x27; then if you move away from the
tower to about 110&#x27; or so that is the most powerful signal.

&gt; &gt; . I also tried the local police and some microwave towers,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; right under the towers, and heard nothing from those sources. But they
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; are on much higher frequencies than AM or FM radio and are not
known to
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; get into any electronics around here.
