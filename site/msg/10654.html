Kay,

Tell him that radio sweep is just one method of ITC. If he can't wrap his mind around the significance of radio sweep then mention others like the water method. I regularly use the sound of my laptop cooling fan for the dynamic sound needed. Hell, I recorded on the way home from work Friday by using the sound of the cars road noise and my window slightly cracked. Here is one I use for live communication; phototransistors in combination with spinning lasers, fed through DC6 and sound soap 2. No radio signals used there, just light!

I have heard the argument before about CB skip, SW noise and others like it. It is a very weak argument! Ask him why it is so hard to believe?

Regards,

Frank R.

I have let my boyfriend listen to some of my files. He cant seem to 
hear anything. (He is a bit hard of hearing) he is saying what we are 
hearing is skip from a cb radio or skip in general. Any imput on this?
