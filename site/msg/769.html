&gt;Yeah I know what ya mean. Ive been so busy with work myself I havent had 
&gt;much time to do anything lately.
&gt;
&gt;   Adding FM will be interesting.
&gt;
&gt;   I can hear that pretty clear and only difference I had was at the end I 
&gt;hear &quot;child princess&quot;.

&gt;just ordered some new chips last night so I can add FM as an additional

&gt;There&#x27;s a lot of darkside interaction, and if you start getting a workable
&gt;system up and running you get those voices that try to either scare you 
&gt;off,
&gt;or distract you from the real stuff. The darkheads don&#x27;t want this stuff to
&gt;work, preferring humans stay in fear, and fear of death is the most 
&gt;powerful
&gt;fear to have. The manipulations can be very subtle. I don&#x27;t want to get
&gt;distracted on other systems till I have a PCB made, and a production system
&gt;out there.
&gt;I have an idea for a Spiricom like device using audio tones, instead of
&gt;using radio as a sound source, I think I can adapt my system to it, using
&gt;the random vlotage gnerator to sweep an audio VCO using the Intersil 8038
&gt;chip. This voice was using a tone generator I had built into one of the
&gt;receivers years ago, and mixed it with the radio noise.You can hear the 
&gt;1000
&gt;hz sqaurewave tone in the background.
