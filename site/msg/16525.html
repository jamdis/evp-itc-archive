Yeah, I was wondering how Frank's statement that these are rarely heard by=
 more than one person and only meant for the user, really supported the beh=
avior of this group of people posting their EVPs and asking for opinions.=
=C2=A0 But, if everyone agrees with Frank on that, we can keep the claim as=
 "The messages received are for the user, and rarely does anyone hear the s=
ame thing as the original listener."

I don't think any of us know really who or what the "enti=

Perhaps I am not being clear.=C2=A0 I am not asking how it works.=C2=
=A0 I am asking what you claim it does.

For example, from your statements =
below, I get:

"The Frank's box allows entities to use FM and AM radio broa=
dcast as raw material, which these enties select and shape to communicate w=
ith the user.=C2=A0 The messages received are for the user, and rarely does=

Can you be any mor=

Also, can the user be defined=
 as the person asking the box questions?
