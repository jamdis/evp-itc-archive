<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>If it helps, i recently modified a Sangean radio that works pretty well with no clicking.  It&#x27;s $50 at amazon and has a built in speaker.

Here&#x27;s a youtube video of it that i made:

Here is a link to the simple hack for the radio, scroll to the bottom:

Here are some samples of what i&#x27;ve been getting with it:

Hope this helps,

&gt; Hi Earl.  The new version of the 12-469 is the worst of the lot in terms of the clicking which is a bummer because it actually produces some pretty good results.  I think among the Shack units, my favorite is probably the 20-125, but it&#x27;s the largest of the group.  Small and easy to use, but requiring a separate speaker like the 469 is the 12-820. (doing these numbers off the top of my head, so I hope I have the prefixes correct) 
&gt; 
&gt; To date, my longest, clearest, most impressive radio sweep results have come from doing a manual sweep using the Duracell KP028 crank flashlight.  The little knob is perfect and it never needs batteries.  :-)  The drawback is you can&#x27;t do a long session uninterrupted, but I never do more than a couple minutes at a time anyway, so that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I like to record, review, record, review, etc. rather than doing one long run then going back over it all later because I want to be sure that I am hearing what is being said as I go along.
&gt; 
&gt; You can google &quot;Duracell Cranklight 3 in 1&quot; and look for the least expensive deal out there if something like this might interest you.  It used to be a bargain on Amazon, but there pricing seems to have doubled since I bought mine.  They come in a twin-pack.

&gt; &gt; Having a back ground in electronics i&#x27;m very interested in finding out 
&gt; &gt; if there is a mod to help get rid of the clicking sound in the 12-469 units.
&gt; &gt; I have heard what the clicking sounds like and not interested in buying 
&gt; &gt; this unit unless there is a fix for that problem.
&gt; &gt; so thats why i asked about if there was any fix for the clicking.
