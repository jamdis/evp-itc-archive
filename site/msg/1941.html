Frank, It's not boring I promise. For everyone here that follows your work it's exciting to watch where this is going. Question, is there a manual over ride so the linear tune function be parked on a station? I know this isn't the purpose but it could be a plus. -Bill

 it you have to download the PCBExpress software at www.PCBexpress.com. The 
 silk screen markings are for assembly purposes, and won't be on this order, 
 so I didn't care if there was some over lap. There's no way to mark the 
 layout underside components, but I have my notes for that. All components 
 are from mouser.com.
 
 Even though the layout is labled "RVG", it is in fact linear and random, AM 
 and FM, with stereo input and output (except for the monitor speaker). There 
 is provision for both wire, and bar antennas. The board was made extra 
 copmpact to reduce cost, I wanted to keep the two boards under $100, the 
 cost was about $93. With silk screen and solder mask, they would have been 
 double.
 
 After endless hours staring at the screen, my eys are about fried, I have a 
 spot in the right eye, that hopefully will clear up.
 
 Butttttt Boring Frank
