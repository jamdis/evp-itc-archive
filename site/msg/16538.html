<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Perhaps a compromise to these opinions is to consider that there are many devices, processes, and theories as to what works, what doesn&#x27;t, what it does, and how it does it.

Here, I was focusing on one item (the box Frank has lent out to be tested), and the claim Frank has for the box:

&quot;The Frank&#x27;s box allows entities to use FM and AM radio broadcast as raw material, which these entities select and shape to communicate with the user.  The messages received are for the user, and rarely does anyone hear the same thing as the original listener.&quot;&#x27;

And with a proposed definition of entity as: &quot;Intelligent communication from entities who are not living human beings&quot;.

Note this suggests a couple interesting tests, such as how rare or common is it for others to hear the same thing, and under what conditions.

&gt; What? How&#x27;s that?
&gt; 
&gt; To most people listening to the even the files posted here, it is just radio gibberish, or they hear their own thing, until someone else tells them what they hear. Science would call it pareidolia, nothing more.

&gt;   If other people could not hear the voices then the files would not be posted here. There are at least THREE things going on. 1) SOme voices are REAL and &quot;impressed&quot; upon the sound carrier. These can be heard by everyone. 2) In some cases the &quot;impression&quot; is not as &quot;clean&quot; and one has to develop &quot;an ear&quot; so to speak, to hear them (like sea legs, but for EVP) 3)the sound forms an enabling &quot;random feild&quot; in the head of the listener which makes him psychically open to the voices of the spirits directly.

&gt;   &gt; Thanks Tom for your comments.  You say that different people listening to the recordings often here the same thing.  But Frank says that is rarely the case.  Wouldn&#x27;t Frank be more of the expert here?

&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; The fact that the operator CAN and DOES make recordings and files of understandable words and phrases shows that we are dealing with an OBJECTIVE rather than a subjective phenomenon here. Two things appear to be going on though. 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; First there is an actual voice modulated signal. Different people who listen to it often hear the same thing. The sound is not perfect and is very noisy, so that would explain others who cannot hear the message.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; The second thing is that some people can listen to the noise as a &quot;random field&quot;, and with a slightly altered state of mind, this field will induce latent &quot;mediumship&quot; ability in the operator and he or she will get a lot more information and voice material than another listener.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; Note that the content random fields have little or nothing in common with whatever imagery or sounds may be percieved from them. They simply enhance the user to access psychic information that, while even not being a &quot;psychic&quot; allows him to get info normally innaccessable to him/her.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; If there is any objective percieved sound similar to what is heard by others impressed upon the background noise, it might be due to the spirit who is speaking being PRESENT. That entity would then be able to get the message through to the operator Psychicly on another level. that the words are also in the noise would be a co-incidence.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; I work with VISUAL random fields---The imagery, while clear, is formed in my mind/eye system , so I cannot photograph it. Some of this EVP background noise may be working the same way too---formed in the Mind/EAR system. This is only heard by the primary operator and likely cannot be recorded to a file. 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; But some random field stuff IS objective--for example, using a random backdrop for ghost photos makes the ghosts easier to, and more often appear in a photo. This is equavalent to the EVP that people can hear on the recorded file.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; I will discuss and explain random field theory itself, later, in its own posting.

&gt;   &gt; &gt; Just a guess, since I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with this - probably
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; the mesages are meant for one user and it&#x27;s best if one user listens at a
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; time.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; It could be that some messages come through that are meant for multiple
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; users at once. I&#x27;ve heard the same things as Frank in some of the recordings
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; he&#x27;s posted. FWIW.

&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks Zack. So how do you see not asking it questions squaring with
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank&#x27;s comment of &quot;It&#x27;s not the device, it&#x27;s the user. The messages

&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; Does that mean two people can&#x27;t use it together? How would they know which
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; the message was for if they do? Or is it best to only use it alone?

&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a freaking radio! The tuning is swept across the entire band, AM or
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; FM, the resulting bits of speech, music, and noise are used by the enitites
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as a raw material to build their voices from. The sweep can be linear,
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; random, or manual, and it does not have to cover the entire broadcast band.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; This is one method and device for providing the raw audio, and if you&#x27;re
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tesitng to see if it&#x27;s just broadcast fragments, consider this-the concept
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is the same as EVPmaker, EVPmaker runs on a computer, the entities
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; manipulate that raw audio *inside* the conmputer, and if you think stray
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; RF is going to get *inside* the hard drive and mix with the audio file
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you have no clue how any technology works.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
