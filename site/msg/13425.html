I have to admit that I thought I had seen the worst 'paranor=
mal' show on television already. I was wrong. Door to the Dead has exceeded=
 my worst expectations.
=A0
Generally, I respect John Oliver's work as a me=
dium. While I have no personal experience with him, in the past he has look=
ed and acted more genuine than not, the rolling of the eyes put aside for t=
he moment.
=A0
I do take exception to the characterization of the talking b=
ox as an Edison device. I have documented the history of Edison, ITC and EV=
P=A0=A0elsewhere. This is however the smallest concern I have with this sho=
w.
=A0
Prior to wathcing I had just had a conversation with a respected col=
league on the West coast regarding interesting phenomena he and others are =
constantly observing in sites with phenomena similar to that on Door to the=
 Dead. None of those measurements were made by this team. The use of therma=
l in this situation is not indicated as well.
=A0
The real concern is that =
no attempt was made to help this family in a broader context. The skeptic d=
id and said nothing skeptical as far as I could tell. Key questions were no=
t asked (at least on-camera) that would reveal the psycho-dynamics of this =
family. We know fairly well at this time that PK phenomena is often centere=
d on a focal person who can exhibit specific characteristics. That the team=
 seems unaware of this is quite disturbing to a person like myself.
=A0
A r=
eal research opportunity was lost in this case, as was an opportunity to ed=
ucate the public on the right way to approach such situations. Continually =
sending the messages that phenomena is based on 'demons' and 'spirits' excl=
usively does nothing to further the position of serious investigators, whic=
h is perhaps most troubling of all.
