<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I remember something about baby monitors, but it&#x27;s been too long. I see them for sale in the thrift stores though. Guess it would kinda act like a Spiricom, where an RF signal is transmitted a short distance and the entities re-modulate it. What about using one to transmit the audio from a box? 

 F-S

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; One of my readers asked me what I thought about using a baby monitor for EVP.  Apparently there&#x27;s one that gets poor reviews at Amazon because it seems to pick up voices from nowhere.
&gt; 
&gt; That sounds like a good candidate for EVP, etc... no pun intended.
&gt; 
&gt; I wanted to see if anyone on this list had talked about this, but Yahoo Groups&#x27; search form isn&#x27;t working.
&gt; 
&gt; Has this been discussed? Tested?  
&gt; 
&gt; Opinions?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheerfully,
&gt; Fiona
