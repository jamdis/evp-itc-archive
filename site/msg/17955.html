<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Again, posting stories after the fact isn&#x27;t a good example.

Since I agree with Frank&#x27;s sentiments of &quot;I just take the approach, try different methods, see what works. I go on the results I get&quot;, let me see if I can help there in determining &quot;what works&quot;.

I will post an experiment shortly. I hope you will participate.

&gt;  RJ, I do not need to post things all over the net, I only took the time to locate some old files from last year just for you, not for glory dear heart.  And if you took the time to listen you would see in the messages that the girl had not yet been found, she as she was only missing one day, I got this all on the first day from spirit, and I asked spirit if I should call it in, which i did, the police did not know it was from Spirit, he thought it was just people talking in a bar or something, I did not tell him what it was, but he took down the information, I am not claiming to have been the clue for the people at all, but they did find her body right in the wall and the guy that killed her was indeed the same name given by the spirit, there are people on the these lists that do remember this, but I think it was Bruce&#x27;s list, he could verify it please don&#x27;t keep bothering me with such mundane talk, i am not going to respond anymore to you, this is silly, if I cannot convince you, then I leave it in the hands of the Great Almighty, Peace lets be still, sf

&gt;                                              If you want to post a prediction, post one.  Give specific dates and details.  Try not to make it for something that is already all over the news and whose outcome is already pretty obvious.
&gt; 
&gt; You keep saying you don&#x27;t need to prove this stuff, then you keep trying to post proof.  Just giving more stories from the past does not prove anything.  No one can confirm the story: and I&#x27;ll bet, even though you claim to have gone to the police with it, you will not be able to even produce the police report.  And I&#x27;ll bet there was not one mention in a newspaper that the case was solved by EVPs.  Must be a conspiracy :)
&gt; 
&gt; We can also not confirm that the stuff you are telling the police wasn&#x27;t already all over the news: which is how I&#x27;ve noticed many EVP interpretations seems operate: you hear what is already on your  mind.
&gt; 
&gt; So if you have a prediction,  post it far and wide, if you think it could help people or save their lives.  What does it say about you, if could have helped people, and turned your back?
&gt; 
&gt; It&#x27;s this kind of thing that turns believers, and even open-minded people, into skeptics.

&gt;                                                 Ok, here is your &quot;evidence&quot; RJ, last year in spring a  girl was killed, her name was Annie Le, back then i was new to this but, got  some great files, which i gave let police hear on DAY  ONE of her being only still missing.  Even in the files themselves  some spirits are telling me she is dead, her voice came through, I have tons of  them, these are a few, and yes I left what they say on them, some are clearer  then others, and if the police officer was able to hear them, you should be  able to as well. I don&#x27;t know why i even bother to worry my head over doubters  anyway.  I posted these to all three lists, because Bruce can  verify what happened  back then too.   You will also  find that the files themselves verify this by the questions asked of  them.   Enjoy,  sf

&gt;            Well, for me, I am satisfied, they do not need to            prove anything more to me, I have already received all the convincing            I need, I spoke to my mother many times in spirit, hearing her voice,            not to mention many other people I know personally, I feel bad for            folks who are so materialistic that they cannot see any further than            the old brick wall surrounding them, even if one should knock it down            these type of people then question if they ever saw the wall to begin            with, their mind&#x27;s are so closed, the hearts so hardened. My motto is            something more like this statement, it&#x27;s only with the heart that one            can see clearly, what&#x27;s essential is invisible to the eye, no matter            what a person might demonstrate to such a skeptic would not convince            them, so it&#x27;s best you live in your world, and I will stay in            mine.  And to each is own, sf ps. i like to use the colors            because that&#x27;s what they are there for. :)

&gt; &gt; I wouldn&#x27;t waste anyone&#x27;s                      time by posting a bunch of radio snippets that 
&gt; &gt;                      &quot;Sound like something&quot;. I would post one if it ever actually                      seemed proof

&gt; &gt; That would be the only worthwhile thing                      to post that I can think of.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Since I have                      never gotten anything like that, I have not posted                      it.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Actually, it&#x27;s more                      interesting than that. Not only do you not control 
&gt; &gt;                      what the &#x27;spirits&#x27; say, you also don&#x27;t control what                      broadcast radio says, 
&gt; &gt; and to a large extent you                      don&#x27;t control what your brain finds and interprets 
&gt; &gt;                      in the noise you are hearing.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I listened to                      these (trying not to look at the labels, since once a                      
&gt; &gt; person looks at the labels, they prime their brains                      to interpret the sounds in 
&gt; &gt; YOUR way, not their own                      way). To me, they were either just a mess of 
&gt; &gt; random                      radio snippets, exactly what you&#x27;d expect if a 3 year old                      were randomly 
&gt; &gt; twisting the radio dial, or they were                      just noise. Nothing paranormal in 
&gt; &gt; the                      least.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think your instinct to stop                      posting this stuff might have been a good 
&gt; &gt; one. I                      suspect you are feeling a bit overwhelmed with this field                      right now, 
&gt; &gt; and it may be something is nagging at                      you inside someplace, saying it is a 
&gt; &gt; waste of your                      time or a burden on your life and health, or that you just                      
&gt; &gt; need a little more space for a while.
&gt; &gt;                      
&gt; &gt; In any case, I&#x27;d recommend a break: take a nice                      month off. See how you 
&gt; &gt; feel being away from all                      this for a while. Come back fresh if you feel ok 
&gt; &gt;                      after that. But if you feel obsessed when away, it might be                      good to ask 
&gt; &gt; your friends and loved ones for some                      opinions on what they see in you. Your 
&gt; &gt; health is                      more important than anything here anyways, and you can&#x27;t                      really 
&gt; &gt; do a job with interpretation of your                      results, much less your other 
&gt; &gt; responsibilities in                      life, unless you put your health first.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well, got                      no response out of the other list, let&#x27;s see if any of you                      
&gt; &gt; folks on these lists can hear these at all. They                      may be too fast, but I did try 
&gt; &gt; to slow them a bit,                      I know, these are very hard to hear, got them last 
&gt; &gt;                      night in response to Steve&#x27;s letter about all the                      &quot;religious&quot; crap I&#x27;ve 
&gt; &gt; been sending, such weird                      files I sometimes send in lately. I do not control 
&gt; &gt;                      what spirits say though, after all they are just people too.                      Got one on 
&gt; &gt; here that&#x27;s really funny, I think it has                      a little demon on it too, he seems 
&gt; &gt; very angry, and                      wants someone to &quot;Let me out! Let me out!&quot; is what he is                      
&gt; &gt; saying, I think he is wanting to come after some                      folks, because, even 
&gt; &gt; demon&#x27;s believe in God. He                      really sounds mad at some people and wants 
&gt; &gt;                      &quot;.....out,&quot; just going to let you hear it, may need to play                      it several times to 
&gt; &gt; hear, but I think its kinda                      cute. I told them what some on the lists were 
&gt; &gt;                      saying, and this was the response. btw Is someone going to                      Florida ? The 
&gt; &gt; last one says something about FL Hope                      you all enjoy them. sf
