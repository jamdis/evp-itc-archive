<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have actually had some success with ghost radar on my droid. I will 
say it is wrong around 96%...but I have had times when it nearly syncs 
up with an EVP, and one situation where it was saying a bunch of things 
related to what I was wearing. Like I said, a hell of a lot of wrong; 
but I feel that since I use it quite frequently, it almost &quot;reads&quot; me, 
if this makes sense. It&#x27;s just like any other piece of technology; they 
are fallible.</pre>
