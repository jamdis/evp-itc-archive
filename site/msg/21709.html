He says, "that Casey left Caylee out in the car, and went in the house  
falling to sleep, Caylee got out of the car, went in the house, saw mom asleep  
then went out into the yard, climbed up the ladder, and got into the pool, 
and  she drown, her mom didn't wake up for an hour, when she saw Caylee in 
the pool  she went into a panic, an so started the lies.  She was going to 
make like  her baby was kidnapped, and all but it really was a terrible  
accident."   David says, she was too afraid to tell anyone what really  happened, 
and started the lie, by acting like nothing was wrong, that a baby  sitter 
had her, and was going to try and make people believe her daughter was  
killed by someone, thinking the body would be found sooner.  I didn't get  all 
about what the guy did yet though, the meter reader, Kronk.    sf
