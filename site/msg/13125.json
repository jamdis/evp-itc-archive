I sent those 8 \nresearchers an envelope containing the debris and asked them to use it \nin five, 30 second sessions and send me the audio files.  I gave them \nno detailed information, except that it was a commercial plane crash to \nkeep the sessions more controlled.\nToday I received the first of the audio files from one of those \nresearchers.  After listening to his third file, my jaw dropped after \nhearing what I did.\nThis is very promising, and I hope to get additional relivant files \nfrom the other researchers.\nI&#39;ll be sharing all the details in the video I&#39;ll be putting on my \nYoutube page early next year.\n\nThanks to all of you who are participating!\n- Mike C.
