it is inerent and inescapable that so-called "scalar" devices must transmit and receive at the same time;  thats their strength and weakness.
   
  DARPA has {rightly} been testing and developing such devices since at least the mid-1970's.  i have first hand knowledge of this.
   
  an odd drawback, early evident, was the reaction of wasps, bees and hornets- which are declining; and the non-reaction of bumble bees- which do not seem to be declining.
   
  by this time of year i am usually removing wasp nests from our living quarters , vehicles etc.  not this year.
   
  ......... today i saw a bumble bee doing his normal thing.  that means something.
   
   
  wasps and bees are helplessly drawn to an active scalar antenna.  bumblebees are indifferent.  cockroaches are repelled.  crickets and spiders are mildly attracted.
   
  .....so what is a "scalar wave"?
   
  it's an oxymoron-- a scalar cannot be a wave.
   
  but that's the term that stuck, though i fought against it for clarity's sake.
   
  beyond that, it's a subtler kind of electrical current and resulting emission that resembles a radio wave and can j-u-s-t be manipulated by the high quality semiconductors just now coming into common use.
   
  there has never been a split-second in my long life that i was not utterly certain that the United States must be 30, 50, 100 years ahead of all other countries in scientific and technical innovation. i know that now ,more than ever, if that is possible.
   
  ......  but  "the people" have a right to know.  now they do.
