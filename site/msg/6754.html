<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce ... so they demonstrated the &quot;box&quot; for regular people .. not 
paranormal people who understand &quot;box&quot;?? (It&#x27;s almost like learning a 
new language at first!!) eeee that must&#x27;ve been tough!!  I saw 
the &quot;box&quot; being demonstrated there once before that .. I was 
impressed but remember that there was reception problems inside the 
museum ...

&gt; Hi Deb,
&gt;  
&gt; Let&#x27;s just say, when any researcher tries to do a public box 
session for people that 
&gt; have not only never heard a box but did not even know what one is 
until the actual demonstration.
&gt;  
&gt; Let&#x27;s just say you will have 99.9% of the people walking away 
going &quot;what was that, the guy was listening to a scrambled radio
&gt; and asking it questions&quot;
&gt;  
&gt; The chances are, even if the audience where familiar with the box 
and the theory and technical functioning that allows for real time 
communication
&gt; with spirits. they would not on their first or maybe even their 
tenth attempt hear any words or responses to questions.
&gt;  
&gt; Not to mention, the demonstrator better hope that he or she has 
somewhat favorable conditions for a successful session.
&gt; It is just not a good practice unless your audience has some 
knowledge and experience with a box of some type.
&gt;  
&gt; Any public session I have heard of left the majority of individuals 
involved with a sour taste for box research.
&gt; And that includes Staten Island ,Halloween night or so I&#x27;ve been 
told. by the presenter himself.
&gt;  
&gt; That&#x27;s why if you ask the original box inventor he will tell you 
that his intention was for the box to be a stationary research tool.
&gt; not a location device.

&gt; Hi Bruce .. What happened on Halloween on SI?? I was planning to 
stop by!Debbie--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday 
&lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Steve,&gt; &gt; I listened to the 
file, It could have said what is labeled.&gt; It was kinda rough and I 
don&#x27;t think anyone but an experienced&gt; researcher used to listening 
to Frank&#x27;s box would hear anything&gt; from the random mode especially.&gt; 
&gt; I think you may have gotten caught up in the moment, I know those 
group sessions can get exciting.&gt; My advice would be to hold off on 
any public display sessions until we refine the communivation to &gt; 
where the average listener is capable of hearing a response. Don&#x27;t 
forget what happened on halloween in staten Island.&gt; Or what happened 
to those knuckle heads at pulse radio.&gt; &gt; I think it would be 
detrimental to the research not to go somewhere and have a group of 
people hear nothing but what &gt; they discern as noise. for the simple 
reason that they are not equiped to hear the actual responses.&gt; &gt; 
Just my opinion as afriend and fellow researcher. also I believe our 
friend Frank believes that the box was not meant &gt; for field work and 
does not perform to the best of it&#x27;s ability in a public situation.&gt;

have been having weird sessions with Frank&#x27;s Box #27, but in a good 
way. They told me to change the antenna, which it did and the random 
started working and never has on this box. They told me tonight to 
put the old antenna back on and the sessions keep getting better and 
better. I dragged Juli and Joel in on what i believed and felt was 
going to be a great box session and here is a file only a couple 
minutes in to our hour long session. This is a bit rough sounding, 
but hearing it live is pretty clear and you can hear me respond and 
than Joel agrees that he heard it too. My sessions are pretty 
incredible since the random mode started working on the FB#27 and i 
feel the random is the best thing out there...hands down. I have done 
Sessions on the internet through Skype all week and i feel the energy 
between Juli and I are really bringing them through clearly. I only 
use FB#27 now in random mode and it is the best feature on any box, 
between the white noise, echo and random there is no competetion up 
to this point. The hacks are good, but nothing is better than an 
original frank&#x27;s box. Our friends on the other side told me that they 
fixed the random mode to go and teach others and i am going to a 
meeting on wednesday to demonstrate the different boxes and our 
friend made a promise to come though if i go....so we will see.&gt; &gt; 
Here is one of the files i got so far.&gt; &gt; -Steve H.&gt; &gt; &gt; Who&#x27;s never
