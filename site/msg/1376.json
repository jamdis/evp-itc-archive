There were two open mike nights in which \nlots\n&gt; &gt; &gt;were drawn for people to come up and ask questions via the box.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Chris interpreted answers, and was assisted by medium Chip \nCoffey.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Many of the attendees had never heard of the box, and most of \nthem\n&gt; &gt; &gt;had never seen it in operation, and it caused quite a stir. \nChris\n&gt; &gt; &gt;also took the box into one of the hotel&#39;s more active haunted \nrooms,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;as part of the featured ghost investigations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;There were two other boxes present on site for part of the time,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;owned by Randy Schneider and Bill Murphy.
