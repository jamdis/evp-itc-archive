<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve been doing some work with some Altera EPM7000 series CPLD&#x27;s (Complex 
Programmable Logic Devices). Those suckers have 25 pins on a side, for 100 
pins total. Maybe when I was 25 I could solder them without a microscope. 
No more ... at least my hands are still steady enough.

&gt; You&#x27;ll note, while the chip is surface mount, it still has only two sides of pins. In radios that use all digital tuning, the chips usually are four sided, and smaller.

&gt; The solder sucker is my preferred method of component removal, some like solder wick instead. I suck out the solder, then re-heat each pin while gently wiggling the module till any remaining solder coools, leaving the pin loose, so I can gently work the module out of the main board. I save the carcas for parts, like capacitors and just incase I have to go back a re-measure a voltage. Then, my grandson takes the old stuff home for his &quot;transporter&quot; he&#x27;s going to build.
