I have a copy of &quot;Breakthrough&quot; \nwhich is the only English translation of any of Raudive&#39;s books and \nthe &quot;diode method&quot; is described in an appendix. The diagram in the \nappendix note shown there (and I can scan in the page in the book and \npost here, if anyone likes) shows a typical 1N914 diode which uses \nsilicon as the base semiconductor.\n\nThe only &quot;transcommunication device&quot; I&#39;m aware of that specifically \ncalled out for the use of germanium was the one diagrammed by the \nspirits in one of the Scole Experiments (and even then - it was a \nblock of this material - not a component diode).\n\nBy the way - it was &quot;Konstantin Raudive&quot; (with a &quot;k&quot;), &quot;Franz Seidl&quot; \n(not Seidle...See Jean de Muelder&#39;s website for original diagrams of \nthe Psychofon from Seidl&#39;s book \nhttp://jeandemeulder.transcommunicatie.nl/psychophone2.htm) \nand &quot;George Meek&quot; (no &quot;s&quot;). Additionally - George Meek&#39;s Metascience \nFoundation developed at least 5 different models of the Spiricom \n(most people are only familiar with Bill O&#39;Neil&#39;s Mark IV).\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;seanjankowski1&quot; &lt;seanjankowski1@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure RetroCom,\n&gt; \n&gt; According to WORLDITC there are many different devices using \ndifferent\n&gt; aspects of the radio and white-noise spectrum. Constantine Raudive\n&gt; used germanium diodes to capture EVPs. Siedle built his psychophone,\n&gt; George Meeks had the Spiricom tone device. Now you have the diode \nfor\n&gt; white noise, radio wave HF static, and a tone device. I am \nattempting\n&gt; to build an all in one audio recording and communication device. I \nam\n&gt; doing this to see if by having a combined unit you can get contact\n&gt; with either one or the other or perhaps multiple contacts at one \ntime.  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Can you define with some detail &quot;all ways&quot; ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- seanjankowski1@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;seanjankowski1&quot; &lt;seanjankowski1@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] All In One Device\n&gt; &gt; Date: Wed, 25 Jun 2008 15:10:33 -0000\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is my first post. I was wondering if anyone had created an \nall in\n&gt; &gt; one ITC EVP device. I know that researchers such as Seidle had \ncreated\n&gt; &gt; the psychophone that seemed to cover many aspects of ITC but I \nhave\n&gt; &gt; yet to see all ways of communication in one device.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have created an all in one design that covers most of the \ndevices\n&gt; &gt; used. If you wish I will share the design.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
