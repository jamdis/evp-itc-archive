That&#39;s how we \nprogress in what we do, different points of view are always \nimportant.  This research is still new and very unexplainable, but we \ndevise theories (Not Facts) as we go along in hopes that we are right \nor at least on the right path.  I have several samples and \ninformation on my web site if you are interested in how i go about \nwhat i call RTSC (Real Time Spirit Communication) research.\n\nwww.keyportparanormal.com\n\nI also have a yahoo group dedicated to this with some of our theories \nand documents that we feel might help others in understanding this a \nbit more.  Other opinions of course are always welcome.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rj &lt;rasterer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Steve, I do try to be skeptical. But just to clear things up here, \nI&#39;ve never said that I believed that real time spirit communication \nis not possible.  While many people here bring skills in electronics \nto this field, I try to help out in the area of process and \nmethodology.  I think a lot of attention has been put on the \nequipment, and on the efforts to collect data. And that&#39;s great. My \nopinion is that less has been put on process and methodology, which I \nfeel is just as important, and can be just as difficult, as the other \nareas. Part of that is interpretation of the data, which is \ngenerally where you&#39;ll find me trying to add value to the \nconversation or commenting on the techniques I see.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you would like me to comment on your other files, I&#39;d be happy \ntoo.
