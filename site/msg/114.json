Therefore, if \npersonality exists after what we call death, it&#39;s reasonable to \nconclude that those who leave this earth would like to communicate \nwith those they have left here. \n. . . I am inclined to believe that our personality hereafter will \nbe able to affect matter. If this reasoning be correct, then, if we \ncan evolve an instrument so delicate as to be affected, or moved, or \nmanipulated . . . by our personality as it survives in the next \nlife, such an instrument, when made available, ought to record \nsomething. \nCertain of the methods now in use are so crude, so childish, so \nunscientific, that it is amazing how so many rational human beings \ncan take any stock in them. If we ever do succeed in establishing \ncommunication with personalities which have left this present life, \nit certainly won&#39;t be through any of the childish contraptions which \nseem so silly to the scientist. &quot;\n\n\n I think Edison assumed the communication would be complicated and \ndifficult, but with our present technology, it is like childs play.\n\n\n Frank"}
