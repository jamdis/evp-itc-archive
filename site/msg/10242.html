Hi Bruce,
    Please let me know how I can contribute also.  
All the best,

Subject: [EVP-ITC] The Research Must Move Forward (it's a long post but important please read)



Hi Everyone,

I would like to make a serious suggestion.
As a senior researcher in the live spirit communication field, Myself 
and a few other researchers here such as Steve hultay, Ann, LC
Just to mention a couple have strived since the beginning to try and 
advance the technology, communication and relations with our spirit 
friends or whatever entities are participating in this communication 
research.

In order to call this research it must continue to move forward.
There are more than enough of the new people here, that do not 
qualify as new people anymore. But full fledged researchers. Of 
course they have much to learn, but so do we all.

Which brings me to my suggestion.
Steve and I have recently been discussing the point we have reached 
in the research, both in process and knowledge. We agreed on most 
points,
the most important one being. It is time to move beyond the same 
mundane session content and the same rudimentary line of questioning.

This research is stagnating for lack of direction, any posted files 
or discussions revolve around the same stale subjects such as, 
"Is there anyone there that wishes to communicate" , 
"What is your name"
"who am I speaking with"
"what is it like where you are"

I believe we have all received every combination of answer to those 
questions that we possibly can, yet we continue to ask them session 
after session. And still become amazed at a yes or no answer or the 
simplest of phrases.

I am not saying this about any single level of researcher but all of 
us myself included have fallen into this rut. We are not learning 
anything, All our efforts are amounting to nothing.

We already know that we are communicating with someone or something. 
I believe we have all come to believe that through our personal 
research and the evidence presented by all of us.

Within the last year the technology and potential of this type of 
research has exceeded all expectations in it's quality and speed of 
development. We are actually letting it go to waste.

I and a few other researchers believe that whoever is on the other 
side of the line has had a hand in some of us developing this new 
equipment and methods of research be it obvious or subtle.

But our methods of research have not excelled, we are conducting 
research in the same manner as we did when there where only about 5 
of us in the whole world actively doing this research.

New individuals are joining our ranks and becoming interested in box 
research every day. The protocol they are being instructed to use is 
antiquated and obsolete.

It is fine to teach them these methods as a basic foundation of the 
research and to get their feet wet. But like any other education 
process it must evolve and develop with the accumulation of knowledge.

If we approached academic education the way we approach box research, 
we would all still be in the first grade.

I propose a committee to develop a method of research and protocol 
that can deal with the ever evolving technology and decide what and 
how we should approach the type of communication we seek and the 
subject matter that should be addressed, that will be continually 
changing.

Only in this way will the wheels of research and learning move 
forward and we will gain the knowledge we seek and hopefully be able 
to share it with the world someday.

But if we continue to ask "Is anyone there willing to speak with me"
We are doomed.

Anyone that wishes to discuss this and give opinions or suggestions
please lets try and get started every minute we waste is a missed 
opportunity for learning.

Bruce
