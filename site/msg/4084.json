I was walking in our local cemetery hold the \nmodified 12-470 near the gravesite of those I questioned.  I have not \nposted any audio from the Mike&#39;s Box 12-470 system or the Spiricomp \n12-469 system yet.  I plan to do one of my internet radio shows where \nI will debut some of the audio files from those systems.\nYou can listen at http://www.ghosttoghostpm.com on the dates those \nwill broadcast.  I have a 2 hour show on Tuesday&#39;s and Friday&#39;s. Each \nshow gets between 400 and 1200 listeners, mostly from archive \ndownloads after the LIVE show is over. Next Friday will be the first \nshow where I debut the newer audio files.\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike, I have one more question for clarification.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I listened to the various voice recordings you captured and do I \n&gt; understand correctly that the little portable-enclosed system \n&gt; (pictured on your blog) captured the audio we&#39;ve heard from you to \n&gt; date?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; LC Duplatt\n&gt; http://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi LC,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The two setups I did were:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Three 12-469&#39;s through a mixer, mixed with white noise \n&gt; (performed \n&gt; &gt; with Audacity), my voice via a microphone, and all that audio \n&gt; &gt; captured using a free program called &quot;Scanner Recorder&quot;. You can \n&gt; &gt; download it here: http://www.davee.com/scanrec/\n&gt; &gt; I have not really taken that unit anywhere to test it properly.  \nI \n&gt; &gt; only did the original testing you hear on the video.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) One 12-470 placed in a &quot;chamber&quot;, with a noise generator (used \n&gt; &gt; a &quot;My Lil&#39; Reminder&quot; 20 second digital recorder/player) with \n&gt; recorded \n&gt; &gt; white/pink noise I captured while in Florida.  Also inside is \n&gt; &gt; a &quot;Listen Up&quot; amplified microphone and an Olympus digital \nrecorder.\n&gt; &gt; The only wiring is a Y-connector which connects the output from \nthe \n&gt; &gt; amplified mic to the input of the recorder, and also to ear-buds \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; listening to what is being recorded. You can also plug a small \n&gt; &gt; speaker into this if desired.\n&gt; &gt; The raw audio from the linear sweep of either the AM or FM band \nis \n&gt; &gt; projected from the 12-470 speaker, into the closed &quot;chamber&quot;, \nalong \n&gt; &gt; with the audio from the speaker of the noise generator (&quot;My Lil&#39; \n&gt; &gt; Reminder&quot;) unit.  Those two sources, plus any ambient noise \ninside \n&gt; &gt; the &quot;chamber&quot; is picked up by the amplified mic and fed into the \n&gt; &gt; recorder and ear-buds. The recorder produces the .wav file.\n&gt; &gt; You can use a 12-469 instead of the 12-470. You just need to \n&gt; connect \n&gt; &gt; a small speker to the output of the 12-469.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As with my three 12-469 system, I have so far only done the \ninitial \n&gt; &gt; test run on th 12-470 system.  I hope to bring both units to a \n&gt; place \n&gt; &gt; where I can do some better experimentation.  I have 2 weeks off \n&gt; near \n&gt; &gt; Christmas time, so that is probably when I&#39;ll be doing that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope I have answered your questions, LC.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Today I modified my Radio Shack 12-469, but have some \nquestions.  \n&gt; &gt; It \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was easy to do, and I instantly plugged it into my Olympus \nvoice \n&gt; &gt; &gt; recorder and recorded off of it easily.  Now I want to pipe \nsome \n&gt; &gt; &gt; white noise in (and ambient), as well. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Is the set-up in your video what has worked best for you \n(with \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; computer and all)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Will you tell us what free computer programs you used (I \nthink \n&gt; &gt; one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is Audacity)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) What microphone and white noise generator did you use for \nyour \n&gt; &gt; &gt; travel pack unit pictured on UFOGeek.com (posted on December \n&gt; 8th)?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; And can you give me a layout for the wiring of it - you know, \nhow \n&gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; all hooks together?  I&#39;ll figure it out sooner or later, but \nI&#39;d \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rather it be sooner!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, LC\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am currently putting together another video, just like my \n&gt; &gt; others \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; showing a very practical way to use the Radio Shack Hack \n&gt; devices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You probably saw my 12-469 practical use videos, now I&#39;m \ngoing \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sharing a 12-470 practical use video.  This one is of a \ntotally \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; portable system that uses a noise generator, the hacked 12-\n470, \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; digital (or analog) recorder, and a microphone which gathers \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; raw \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; audio sweep, white noise (or in my case a special white/pink \n&gt; &gt; noise \n&gt; &gt; &gt; file \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I created), and any ambient noise within a chamber.. and \nplaces \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; session int a .wav file.  It also includes an ear piece so \nyou \n&gt; &gt; can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hear, real time, what the digital recorder is recording (the \n&gt; &gt; mixer \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the session sound within the chamber).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stay tuned for that video later today....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All my Radio Shack Hack videos can be found at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.ufogeek.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
