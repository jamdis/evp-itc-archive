What RS hack are you using?  I don&#39;t use the 469 because it clicks and drives me mad, but there are others that work well.  The 12-820 armband radio works well and i&#39;ve sent frank a few that he used in a couple of his boxes.  I actually think that it&#39;s my 12-820 radio tuner that is in Chris Moons box that he uses all the time.  You&#39;re welcome chris.  There is also the 12-150, Sangean Dt-200vx and a new model RS radio 12-587.  Let me know if you need help in modifying or going over sessions.\n\nhttp://www.keyportparanormal.com/hackableradiosghostbox.html\n\nhttp://www.keyportparanormal.com/originofthehackedbox.html\n\nhttp://www.keyportparanormal.com/simpleghostboxhack.html\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Gustavo Chumbes&quot; &lt;gustavo.chumbes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi for those like me who have the radioshack one, which band you would\n&gt; suggest in order get better results, AM or FM?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Gustavo\n&gt;"}
