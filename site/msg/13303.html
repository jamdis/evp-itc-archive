Gotcha Frank.=

Something I forgot to clarify in my last email.=
... ITC is not a belief system, belief is not a requisite for this research=
. The question of mental competency can only be answered after evaluation b=
y a qualified psychologist. If a person is neglectful or abusive then a chi=
ld could be removed. Social workers usually work under the license of a sta=
te certified psychiatrist (who is an MD) and has=A0to give the final=A0diag=
nosis of=A0the subject. The social worker can provide therapy, recommendati=
ons and such but cannot certify a person incompetent.

Its not as easy as i=
t looks to take a child away from thier mother and father. Technically, eve=
rything is supposed to be fair when it comes to this subject but in a lot o=
f cases it is not. That depends on how well connected the social services p=
erson is and how good of a lawyer you have. Ultimately, even the psychiatri=
st has to present evidence and recommendations to a judge who makes it offi=
cial.

To answer the question whether a child would be removed from parents=
 who research ITC; highly unlikely!

Regards,

Frank R.

Your practice =

Most religions are based upon the idea that there is a high=

I worry more ab=
out the kids who grow up with parents who are alchoholics, drug addicts, li=

As for if the effect is po=
