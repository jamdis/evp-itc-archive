Due to one of these incessent argurments, I had to back away from this some years ago as I almost got fired becuase yet someone else that thought they knew so much more forwarded all my e-mails to my boss. \n\n Then someone else seemed to be insinuating that I may have tampered with the imgaes. Very insulting. This stuff goes on an on, regardless of the quality of voices, or the images. I have reached my saturation point. There seems to be nothing more to be gained by presenting anything else. Now, I can sympatize with Richard Roberts!\n\n The group will continue, as there are a number of box and paranormal experts here that are more than happy to tell everyone what this stuff really is and how it works. \n\n I didn&#39;t mean to create bad any feelings.\n\n F-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Adrienne&quot; &lt;abortree@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for getting back to me. I thought I had destroyed the group by accident.  Awful feeling!  \n&gt; \n&gt; I completely understand and am very grateful that he started this group and is willing to share and let share ideas and files. God forbid he should leave!!   I&#39;m not used to looking at video this way so it would be easy for me to miss a lot.  I did see the Upside Down Lincoln and the face at the end in the second attachment of &quot;If this is the only one...&quot;  I need more practice and a more open mind, I think.  This is all so far reaching.  Thank goodness he, especially (and the others in this group) are doing this and sharing these ideas.  Kudos to Frank for all of his work!\n&gt; \n&gt; -Adrienne\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m glad you took another look..hey listen we all are learning here..that message was not solely to you..I never saw you try to correct anyone on what they where hearing but some on here does ALOT...its starting to sound as if they feel like they knew more then anyone and most just started doing this where..Frank,Steve and some other have been doing this for years..Some even have the nerve to try to talk done to Frank..now remember this is the man the made the box..so i just think its insulting and ignorant. I for one will be really pissed of if they ran him from his own group..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Fri, 12/31/10, Adrienne &lt;abortree@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Adrienne &lt;abortree@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: The case for faces.\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Friday, December 31, 2010, 3:23 AM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Ursula,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes I did and I saw it.

It seems to be a normal function of our own minds(living or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dead), the same as reverse speech. I found some faces in old EVPs from boxes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and also in music files. The ones from Evanescence are pretty impressive in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person, and do not seem to be intentionaly embedded.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know, it&#39;s not ghost hunters, and most don&#39;t want to have to think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think most want this stuff in a neat little box, all well defined, all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rules and protocols known, but it just won&#39;t stay in one box, or universe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for that matter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Frank,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think that I see what you mean. I mean no offense, but I it would be helpful to see something a little more definitive that couldn&#39;t be mistaken for matrixing. Is this possible? Is it just me?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Adrienne\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
