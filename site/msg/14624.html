I see .. skype as in the program to make telephone calls via the internet?

anyhow on the second clip could you listen to these marks for me Kristin?

4 second

15 second

34 second

and 52-54 seconds

especially the 15 second mark as I still can't make it out but it almost sounds like my hometown (where I am now)

If you can it would be greatly appreciated.


Shane
