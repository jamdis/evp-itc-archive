I was wondering if anyone had created an all in\none ITC EVP device. I know that researchers such as Seidle had created\nthe psychophone that seemed to cover many aspects of ITC but I have\nyet to see all ways of communication in one device.\n\nI have created an all in one design that covers most of the devices\nused. If you wish I will share the design."}
