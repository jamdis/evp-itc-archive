It&#39;s great to see others giving this method a try.  I&#39;ve been working with this technique going on three years now.  It takes forever and a day to go through the video one frame at a time, so whenever I share, I always just provide the still captures of the images I find.\n\nInterestingly, two of my ITC images have been verified by a forensic lab as being a match to the photograph of the person taken while they were still in the physical.  Kinda cool.  :-)\n\nI&#39;d love to take a peek at the images you got once you&#39;re done going through the video and clipping them out.  I actually saw some while looking at your video (I kept hitting the stop button randomly).  I tried to find your posted still images, but don&#39;t see them.  LOL, probably &quot;operator error&quot; on my part!\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Chad&quot; &lt;cawiggins78@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Its kind of hard to see anything in an uploaded video, Bill. If you have Skype I can send you the original file. That way you can go through it frame by frame as is required for seeing the images. There is still a lot of images I haven&#39;t pulled as of yet in there.
