Now the fad is demon hunting! That is so far\nover the top I won&#39;t even play anymore, y&#39;all can have it.\n\n No, I don&#39;t own the group, I gave it up years ago after another stupid\narguement, all my posts and e-mails got sent ot my boss and I almost got\nfired. Everything I say about box use is completely ignored, all anyone\nwants is to run around the dark playing ghost busters. With rare exceptions.\nEven those that actually try to use the box for communuications seem to have\nan agenda.\n\n This stuff goes on weekly, it&#39;s just enough.\n\nF-S\n\nI ha e wa ched his ield being aken o e by he ghos hun e men ali y o yea s, he ocus being on he nega i e, he igh ening,  he e il, and ho o , while eal spi i communica ion is comple ely igno ed in a o o making a name o ones sel .
