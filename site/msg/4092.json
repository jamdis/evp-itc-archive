Good for you!!!  I hope \nthey have a place to listen to the show in an archived form.  Most \nvenues do.  Have fun with the interview.\n\n- Mike\n\n-----\n\nAll my Radio Shack Hack videos can be found at:\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Joel, if I spoke other languages I would try. There seems to be\n&gt; some psychic link between the experimenter and the device so \nresponses\n&gt; in a language you cannot speak could be challenging.\n&gt; \n&gt;  If any of my peers on this forum have statements or observations \nthat\n&gt; could be shared I will try to work those in tonights interview. I \nwent\n&gt; ahead and agreed to the interview after first conferring with Frank \nas\n&gt; I want this to represent the work done by the members here. -Bill\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, joel smith &lt;sparky1j41@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; well good luck . hey i was wondering if the tech on the other side\n&gt; only understand English or has anyone tried to see if other \nlanguages\n&gt;  would work also ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; psi_research &lt;vilhellm@&gt; wrote:                               The\n&gt; folks behind the event at The Stanley Hotel that Frank attended\n&gt; &gt;  last month have invited me for a chat tonight to discuss ITC. \nI&#39;ll be\n&gt; &gt;  on Darknessradio.com at 9 p.m. Pacific time. This message has \nbeen\n&gt; &gt;  posted after speaking to Frank since for me, ITC includes the \nresearch\n&gt; &gt;  that is covered by this group as well as the video ITC \nexperiments\n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;ve done. -Bill\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;      \n&gt; &gt;                                \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo! \nMobile. \n&gt; Try it now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
