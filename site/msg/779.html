Yeah they give guidance when they have it to give. I remember you getting the open box messages and trying to make it work. I am like you I usually dont understand what is being said until a later date. I too have had messages changed often its just one or two words but now and then the "editor" really goes at it and changes the entire message completely until there is very little trace evidence of the original message.
   
  I asked them once why this happens and was told that sometimes folks make mistakes
   
  LOL I guess thats true when I write an email often the thought I first type is not always what makes it thru to the final send, I go back and I correct the mistake or change the wording. It still amazes me sometimes the degree of changes that can happen. Another reason why I try to save everything to backup.

one of the mini boxes I drilled 3/8 holes in the cover to cut out feedback,

works. So I do get some guidence from the "guys", I just don't understand 
it.......most of the time!! Curiously, when I first got that message I heard 
"Frank has a girl friend", which was false, then it seemingly changed to 
"leave the box open" both having the same amount of syllables. That was back 
in 2003. It really makes one question one's hearing!
