Couldnt hear any of them just their fireworks popping noises. Sounds like they are right outside in my yard with me but there was nobody around. And no loud voices until I spoke just the one that seems to modify the fireworks sounds. Once I spoke they were everywhere all around my voice and overlaying. Pretty cool. \n\nMisty\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;April Abercrombie&quot; &lt;april@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; There was no one else in the yard with you??

It was great to meet him and Deborah Preece after knowing them both for so long online! They are both as passionate about this subject as I am.\n&gt; \n&gt;         I also uploaded some fantastic evp I recorded on the 4th of July out in my yard alone (if one is ever really alone LOL I think the voices contradict that statement). Almost all voices were quite loud and clear for my ears and required no filter or enhancement. You can listen to them here:\n&gt; \n&gt;         http://www.esnips.com/web/NewEVPVoices\n&gt; \n&gt;         Enjoy!\n&gt;         Misty\n&gt;"}
