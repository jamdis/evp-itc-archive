One says a word and the other gives feedback. I hear this order: &quot;Metal.&quot; &quot;Good.&quot; &quot;Kettle.&quot; &quot;Suck.&quot; &quot;Pretzel.&quot; &quot;Okay.&quot; &quot;Apple.&quot; &quot;?&quot; &quot;?&quot; &quot;Practice..you...control..?&quot; At this point, I have decided that I must be losing my mind and can&#39;t be hearing what I seem to be, so I ask if anyone can say my name. They ignore me and continue, &quot;Pencil.&quot; &quot;Check.&quot; &quot;Music...polka.&quot; \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Ann%27s%20files/techspracticing010208.mp3 \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles\n\nRegards,\n\nlisbyfarrum &lt;lisby@...&gt;"}
