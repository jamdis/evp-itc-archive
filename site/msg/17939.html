Yeah, maybe same persons?  At any rate, i found some of those old  files,

and in them one can hear where they haven't found her body yet, that was  o=

day one, before the police even thought she had been killed.  You can  h=

my questions, and the spirits answers fairly well I hope, they are not=
 very  
loud though.  Frank, I know this stuff is real! sf

I wouldn't waste anyone's  time  by posting a bunch of radi=

Actually, it's more  interesting than that.  Not only do you not control  =

what the 'spirits' say, you also don't control what  broadcast radio says,=
 
and to a large extent you don't  control what your brain finds and interp=

I listened to these  (trying not to l=

 looks at the labels, they prime th=

YOUR way, not their own  way).  To =
me, they were either just a mess of  
random radio snippets, exactly what y=

twisting the radio dial, or the=
y  were just noise.  Nothing paranormal in the
