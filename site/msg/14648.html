Yeah, I think a lot of pretenders do try to find ways to promote themselves=
 into more credibility.=A0 In fact, I wonder about that project you are goi=
ng to be doing with Mr Moon.=A0 It's my guess he is the one who suggested i=
t (maybe even dropped some profitability hints?).=A0 Realize, his method of=
 performing medium with the box, and charging the vulnerable large amounts =
of money, is under attack from many quarters, and he has begun to go on the=
 defensive.=A0 One thing that is hard for him to defend, is how he can be s=
o expert with the box when he had nothing to do with its construction.

Now=
 consider, if he can get the box's maker to participate in a project togeth=
er, even just once, he can add to his list of credentials things such as "W=
orked together with the original box's designer, Frank Sumption, on new des=
igns." Or even "Co-creater of the new Box", whatever it is.

You will be gi=
ving him that very credibility, that those "do my shows" are looking for.=
=A0 Maybe even getting him new customers.=A0 Just by associating with him o=
n one project.

My advice is, be careful that you aren't just being used fo=
r your credentials Frank.
