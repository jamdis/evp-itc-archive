Neli,

I really appreciate this information.  In many ways this is new to me.   By sharing information this
will help me.  I truly like to be positive first, but I also understand that people and spirits make their own choices. 

So by ignoring them we are not acknowledging anything they are saying?  Does this work?  Do they move on?

floyd

floyd,
 
This same spirit once shouted me out while I was in my daily meditation, so out loud that I thought she was a neighbour, then I could hear also her steps outside the room, then I began to realize that the steps never fade out, I didn't panick cause I thought it was my neighbour, but when I realized that it was not, immediately my guide appeared to me in a light form, and told me (telepathically) not to be afraid, so I did that, then ignored all the thing, this was almost 4 years ago,  but I think these communications are from the same entity, its a woman, I don't think that if I talk to her, she would change her ill- humor, what about if she wants attention just to get in and then I wouldn't be able to put her out?
 
Could it be a mental projection of a living person ? I can't understand why a spirit can be so envious, when she shouted me while in meditation, she said "YOU SHUT UP NOW"  very strongly and in a very bad humor. When this happened I was gonna tell her "go to the hell" cause I thought it was my neighbour, once that I proved that it was not,  I couldn't understand how come a spirit could yell so loud, but I never got scared, I was ready to fight back.
 
But one must not follow their games, cause these kind of spirits want to bother, and protectors or guides most be called in, to protect the meditation or the EVP.
 
How can we know that they have good intentions? of course we can feel some of them, but not all, some can disguise themselves, I suppose.
 
In the EVPs I ignored her, but I think she wants to catch some attention, but I can't trust her, even if she change her attitude. Spirits can be sometimes very tricky.
 
Intuition can help us very much in these cases, but not always.
 
Neli
