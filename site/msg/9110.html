Hi Kay,
 
I agree with you.  This guy puts a ghost sticker over the Radio Shack  name 
and nobody knows. I think if we do the add on Ebay and put the links on  there 
as well as the hacking instruction as well as the yahoo groups like we  would 
all further ourselves.  I just didn't do it because I did not want to  offend 
anyone on here by doing it without letting everyone know first.  I  have given 
away (4) radio's away so far to very deserving individuals who could  not get 
them.  But it still would be nice to let it be known that we are  out there.  
We are not a WATCHDOG group but still do not like to see people  taken 
advantage of for their not knowing.
 
Jeff

Sorry Jeff I do remember you offering that. I think its a good idea 
to  let people know if they are really interested in one they can get 
one at  radio shack and hack their own. Since it was your idea if you 
want to you  can list it or I will. I just hate to see people paying 
$100 for  one.
