<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Isn&#x27;t that the former AA-EVP? The crackhead that had a panel of &quot;more
qualified listeners&quot; debunk the box?  Where does one go to school to get a
degree in more better hearing?

 I think all of this stuff works the same, it&#x27;s all raw audio--white noise
has audible components that is used as the raw audio. Those that want to
pigeon hole the phenomenon are just ignorant, and think that somehow the
physical, or what is perceived as physical is the absolute top of spiritual
development.

 Another problem is that &quot;science&quot; (or more like lack there of) outright
rejects the boxes with out testing, so these long established &quot;experts&quot; in
EVP wish to keep with something that is somewhat accepted, white noise BS,
that one has to almost go deaf trying to hear. So they kowtow to the
skeptics and reject the boxes.  Yeah, real science there!

&gt; CB,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the link.  That is exactly what I was talking about.  The last
&gt; time I checked, the results had not been posted.  No surprise here, they
&gt; rules GB out.  But, their fallacy was that they were trying to condense GB
&gt; communication into terms of EVP which in my opinion cannot be done.  They
&gt; are two distinctly different forms of communication.
&gt;
&gt; I find it quite amusing that they surmised that GB technology does not work
&gt; based upon a few select files based off of one user using one box.  How
&gt; ridiculous, not to mention limiting, is that?  If they wanted to actually
&gt; conduct a study, it should have been with ghost box users who have a
&gt; relationship with the other side.  Or at the very least, invited ghost box
&gt; users to listen to their meager file selection in order to contribute.
&gt;
&gt; Oh well.  Those of us who use the boxes know that it works and that is all
&gt; that matters.  I did a public demonstration of ghost boxes last night during
&gt; a fund raising event (using a minibox plus and a Joe&#x27;s box) that left over
&gt; 400 people convinced (including members of a different ghost group) that
&gt; there was something to this.  Jaws were dropping as my name was called out,
&gt; soldiers names were called out, and even the name of a general who was at
&gt; the Fort we did the benefit for.
&gt;
&gt; So despite the efforts of groups like ATC to put GB down, ghost boxes will
&gt; catch on.

&gt;&gt; I, too, saw the &quot;guess my line&quot; (i.e. guess the secret object) experiment
&gt;&gt; on the ITC web site as well and also thought of someone else who used to be
&gt;&gt; on this group. I suspect he may possibly have gotten that idea from this web
&gt;&gt; site?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In any case, I did find this article on the ITC web site discrediting or
&gt;&gt; debunking or whatever the proper term is for EVP&#x27;s via radio sweep. Perhaps
&gt;&gt; this is what you are referring to?

&gt;&gt; results from an early experiment? I just went to their site and couldn&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; find mention of it, but right on their homepage there was this:
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Everyone is invited to use EVPmaker to name the secret object.&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Sounds familiar, huh? I wonder if RJ is part of their group.
