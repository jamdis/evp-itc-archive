I think maybe you should check out Frank Sumption and Mike Coletta&#39;s videos they have posted. Frank has some on youtube displaying one of his boxes as it scans freely. Mike has video posted of the &quot;how to&quot; for setting up each of the radios hes hacked. It gives you a good idea of how to start. Once you start getting the basics and are able to hear whats coming thru then you can start asking questions for live feedback. As most have come to see, the rate of speed is often very quick so make sure you record your sessions to analyze afterwards. Start with short sessions it helps.\n   \n  Good luck!\n  Misty\n   \n  \n\n&quot;Carol B.&quot; &lt;cbreck@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hi all,\n\nI&#39;ve been reading all the posts for the last couple days....I&#39;m a little\nafraid to ask but here goes....I&#39;m experienced with evp...but know nothing\nabout the radio shack hack....could someone tell me step by step how to\nhave a session?
