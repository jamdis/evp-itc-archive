<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank you really impressed people with your research, your passion for
ITC, and especially your recordings. Thanks for being a big part of
the retreat and  giving everyone a heartfelt talk about your work.

Also a thanks to Bill for being there and showing up with his array of
digital dowsing gear and data logging software. It was interesting to
have both of you side by side showing alternate approaches to audio ITC.

By the way, in excess of $15k was donated to the Shriner&#x27;s Children&#x27;s
Hospital from this event.

&gt;  Well, I had a good time, did several talks, and--get this! An
investigation. Or rather I kinda tagged along on a group&#x27;s
investigation and used one of the boxes. There was entities answering
questions, and responding tot he group members. I gave the group the
tape, so I won&#x27;t be able able to play those. On my own recordings, the
spirits were pretty the same as  get at home, and even my son come
through wiht &quot;My father did this&quot;, which I played for a larger group.
I loaned a box to another group, and they also got entities to answer
questions, and interact. 
&gt;  
&gt;  RoboBox did perform for a group, with at least one meaningful
comment. A woman came to the table afte the talk, and asked &quot; Do they
onokly talk for you&quot;&quot;, and immediately RoboBox put out &quot;for you&quot;,
followed after a few seconds &quot;Loves to cook&quot;, the woman was a cook!
&gt;  
&gt;  The whole thing is very energy intense.
