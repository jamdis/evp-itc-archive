We haven&#39;t had the chance to\nspeak in a few weeks.\nWhat are the difference in the 469 and the 470 besides 2 channel vs.\n4? You are still choosing one channel and it is still a linear sweep\nright? Technically, what would be the difference in choosing AM on the\n469 and AM on the 470? The pulsing sound is absolutely annoying. \n\nBabs \n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Had a pretty good session today, i&#39;ve been pretty blocked with other \n&gt; boxes yet i seem to always get great results with the RS 12-470.  Some \n&gt; really good responses to my questions.  Hey babs, i think you should \n&gt; give the RS box a little time and maybe you will start to get stuff.  \n&gt; Although i have a 12-469 also and it really sux compared to the 12-\n&gt; 470.  The constant pulsing noise in the 469 model just drives me crazy \n&gt; enough to not concentrate.  Try looking for an older style model of the \n&gt; 12-470, that&#39;s probably the best radio i own hands down.  Instant \n&gt; results always and consistently.  All my boxes work, but they are \n&gt; finicky sometimes.  No need to comment to my posted files guys, just \n&gt; listen and see if i&#39;m on some sort of a right track with the \n&gt; communication.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
