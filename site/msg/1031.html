impossibly pink smoke coming out of 
&gt;  computer you can go to weirdstuff.com and get $79 dollar dual p3 
&gt;  server (you will have to get some USED ecc memoryfrom ebay--dont 
buy 
&gt;  the new stuff)  i promise that tyan masterpiece will make your 
other 
&gt;  electronics behave, too.  you will be dumdfounded at how FAST 1.2 
ghz 
&gt;  can be.  windows 2000 professional is only operating system that 
&gt;  works.  you need a free reg cleaner &quot;advanced windows care&quot; 
(google 
&gt;  it)
&gt;  
&gt;  you will have no more burns.
&gt;  
&gt;  alternatively,
&gt;  
&gt;  you can get fast , LOW VOLTAGE xeon cpus, dual server board like
&gt;  
&gt;  tyan i7501, (only use tyan and only server board) and 
&gt;  UNDERCLOCK!!!!!!!  , yes thats right, for a 3 gig i underclock to 
1.6 
&gt;  ghz.  hyperthreading must always be disabled ( unless you want to 
be 
&gt;  a slave to cooked cpu or unless you have &quot;otto&quot; handy)
&gt;  
&gt;  my ultra low voltage dual xeon running at 1.6ghz beats the pants 
of 3 
&gt;  gig p4 in every test that matters

&gt;  &gt; Thanks for the advice Misty! Ive learned my way around computers 
&gt;  over the years, but this is too weird and it definnitly 
corresponds 
&gt;  to how much Im progressing with the contacts I am trying to 
maintain. 
&gt;  Asking it to stop seems to invite worse. This interference has (I 
&gt;  suspect) an intent and Ive found that the best fix is ignoring 
this 
&gt;  stuff...in any case..Its good to know Im not the only one whos 
gone 
&gt;  through this....so gathering my dignity...anyone here know if 
theres 
&gt;  any reason to be concerned about EMF levels? I sure am getting 
mild 
&gt;  flu like symptoms fairly regularly...used to be &quot;not so mild&quot;
&gt;  &gt; Light,

&gt;  &gt; Not uncommon in this work Monki. If ya lived close enough I 
could 
&gt;  fix it for ya but not sure where on the east coast you are 
residing 
&gt;  (yes guys I can fix pc&#x27;s LOL =P but no that doesnt make me the 
tech 
&gt;  type...practice makes perfect). I went thru two computers in a 
months 
&gt;  time, fried everything completely right down to the last chip. 
&gt;  Appliances dont last long at my house (near me) and tv&#x27;s, vcr&#x27;s, 
&gt;  backups units...u name it I have fried it. It finally stopped when 
I 
&gt;  asked them to stop whatever they were doing that was putting so 
much 
&gt;  pressure on my machinery. Now they say Otto is in charge of 
&gt;  equipment, and havent had much problems on my end. 
&gt;  &gt;    
&gt;  &gt;   Email weirdness is also common I have watched mine and others 
&gt;  emails disappear, then sometimes show up later with changes made 
in 
&gt;  the wording of the message. Retro Dave has bore the brunt of the 
&gt;  email problems LOL I just had it happen once when I responded to 
his 
&gt;  postings of having problems.  My post disappeared then came back 
&gt;  changed/edited. Thats been a long time ago tho. 
&gt;  &gt;    
&gt;  &gt;   After saying all that you should of course check the basics, 
make 
&gt;  sure everything is plugged up properly, see if anything feels 
&gt;  extremely hot (if it is shut it down immediately to cool) then ya 
may 
&gt;  wanna pop the lid off the tower of the pc to check inside and 
remove 
&gt;  the sound card, clean the contacts, then replace it to see if that 
&gt;  helps. UNPLUG IT FROM ELECTRIC FIRST! If that doesnt help then you 
&gt;  may need to replace the part. Keep an eye on temperatures if 
&gt;  something is running hot sometimes it will cause the metal to 
&gt;  swell/bend/melt/move.

sound 
&gt;  is blown! No speakers or headphones work. I heard a pop and then
&gt;  (silence is not always golden for us evp types!) I have been 
through 
&gt;  alot of hardware this month! Thats not mentioning screwed up 
&gt;  software, digital recorders and sound files and emails that just 
seem 
&gt;  to go missing! I hear from other researchers that this is not 
&gt;  uncommon.Im losing stuff quickly. Ill be outta business before 
long! 
&gt;  Is there a safeguard for this? Anyone had these things happen to 
them?
&gt;  &gt; Ive wondered if emf protection might be in order...I hope I dont 
&gt;  sound completely madd!(besides, its the Madd Hatter thats got that 
&gt;  covered. Im actually more like Alice...clueless! So...SOS!
&gt;  &gt; in other  words...
&gt;  &gt; HELP!
