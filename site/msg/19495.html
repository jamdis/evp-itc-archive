In early 2009, there was a total Solar Eclipse that was not seen in the US.=
 =C2=A0I calculated the time the eclipse would be total as seen in Africa, =
and started a GB session here in California at the same time. The communica=
tion was awesome and the clarity was amazing!

      Cheers to all,



Has anyone notice any type of increase of activit=
y just before, during, and after an eclipse? Do you get better quality or m=
ore evp's during those times or is there no change? If so, what is the "win=
dow of opportunity" for using an eclipse for get paranormal activity, be it=
 video, radio, digital recorders, etc. for the eclipse (3 days before, 3 da=
ys after, etc.)?



Does an eclipse influence paranormal activity during th=
ose times? Any insight would greatly be appreciated.
