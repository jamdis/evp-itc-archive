Guess ya missed mine on         Date:  Thu, 17 Jan 2008 15:55:24 -0800 (PST)   =) that was a FB file ya posted
   
  Only have 71 emails to go thru just since being at work, add that to the 51 waitin in the inbox this morning, i think maybe people just get TOO MANY posts/emails sometimes to comment on everyone elses stuff. Some of us only have a few free minutes and they may prefer to spend them analyzing files or recording new ones. Or just busy with life =)
   
  Personally I listen to files all the time that i dont comment on whether i hear it or not. Just has to do with time constraints, dont get too upset. I post things all the time without expectation that anyone else can hear it or that anyone else will comment on it. If you need feedback grab a few friends, record together, share every file and comment in chat if they do or dont hear it. Thats what we do =) Or just private email works.
   
  For instance I speak with Ratka most weekdays and Laura, we just share files then or upload them to our esnips which sends out notifications that the new file is uploaded for us to listen when we get time.
   
  Sumption posts stuff all the time nobody comments on LOL if he thinks its a really good or important one he just reposts it or shares it in email.
   
  Just a few ideas for ya because I know you are hungry for feedback and it does sometimes help to hear what others hear because they may get something different that has meaning.
   
  I was going to start a few multi recording nights here for the group but my schedule has been busy so I just do my one group recording per week when I can make it (and when they can). Why dont you start one up. Pick a few nights that you are free and lets get a chatroom going (dang these groups used to have them built in but I dont see that feature now). 
   
  Who wants to be in charge of a night? You could run it seven days a week if you get enough volunteers =)
   
  Rest is up to you guys. I know many of you are nterested in recording with others...so step up, volunteer, and get it started.
