<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was going to use the second side of a tape for recording last night, but
found aprevious recording on it, I don[&#x27;t know when ot was recorded, but
they talk as if they are in the moment, such as saying the cat(Freeway) is
at the door, so I checked, and he was.

 Hmmmm, boxes limited? Audio limiting? Easy enough to add. Audio limiting
makes the output vary constant, as it drops the gain for loud signals and
boosts for weak signals. Interesting!
