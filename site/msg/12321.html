<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Carol.  I think the Ovilus and Puck are two completely different animals from any of the 
radio sweep units out there.  If anything, I&#x27;m thinking they&#x27;d be more similar to EVP maker 
with the allophones file.  I&#x27;ve always wondered at what point the manipulation by spirit 
takes place when using any of these methods.  

I have the Puck and haven&#x27;t heard the name Seth so maybe its unique to the Ovilus.  I 
haven&#x27;t worked with the Obilus (though I&#x27;d like to!) The Puck has a &quot;phonemes&quot; setting 
which allows it to pick combinations from 300 phonemes (speech fragments) so 
theoretically it should be able to produce many more words than what are on listed as 
choices when in &quot;dictionary&quot; mode.  The Ovilus also has a phonetic mode (according to the 
manual) but I don&#x27;t know how many speech fragments it has to choose from.  Given that it 
does have the ability to combine fragments to form new words, as does the puck, it makes 
sense that people are getting words not the list.  

I only use the Puck in phonemes mode and have had amazing results with it during Q&amp;A 
sessions.  When I lost my dog at the end of June, I asked the puck if it could tell me more 
about who she was with and within the next 30 seconds it responded, &quot;Dylan, grandma .... 
pet that you love.&quot;  Dylan is the name of my grandson who was lost due to miscarriage, 
just a couple weeks before our dog died.  I find this astounding because A) the response is 
relevant, specific, and even included a phrase at the end, and B) this was created from only 
speech fragments, not words in dictionary mode.

&gt; My team has not yet purchased the Ovilus but I have been told that it has the ability to 
form words that have not been programmed into it. Since I have never used one, I am 
wondering what are the similarities between the Ovilus and Frank&#x27;s Box. Could it be at all 
possible that rather than just forming words or sounds based on atmospheric readings, 
spirits are speaking through the Ovilus as they do Frank&#x27;s box? 
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t mean to sound silly or presumptous, but I am very very curious!! I am looking 
forward to purchasing the Ovilus as well as the puck in the near future! Thanks for any 
feedback onthe Ovilus!

&gt; I have a puck, and I have been getting the name Seth too. I also have had
&gt; my puck give words that are not on the list.
&gt; 
&gt; Carol B.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m new here, but have been into paranormal research for 6 years now.
&gt; &gt; I am the type of person that never gets EVP voices with a recorder so
&gt; &gt; I thought I would experiment with things like the Frank&#x27;s box and
&gt; &gt; Ovilus. I recently got the ovilus and brought it to a cemetery and
&gt; &gt; field where a church burned down many years ago. I can not get too
&gt; &gt; specific without having people thinking I am making stuff up but it
&gt; &gt; got fairly wild towards the end of the session. For most of the time
&gt; &gt; we were there the Ovilus seemed to be spitting out a lot of random
&gt; &gt; stuff but it kept mentioning the name Seth. After we moved over to the
&gt; &gt; field where the church was, the ovilus got a lot more active and
&gt; &gt; started saying relevant words like cross and priest. The Ovilus was
&gt; &gt; MUCH more active when being used by our female member. Towards the end
&gt; &gt; the Ovilus said I am Seth, and the woman that was with me told Seth
&gt; &gt; that she did not want to talk to you I&#x27;ve heard bad things about you.
&gt; &gt; After that the Ovilus said rather nasty things to her and she started
&gt; &gt; feeling nauseous and she ripped the headphones off her head. Needless
&gt; &gt; to say we ended the session and got out of there.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Over the course of our investigation we found that the Ovilus was
&gt; &gt; saying many words that are not on the 500 word list, so yesterday I
&gt; &gt; did some test recordings to see what words would come up and one of
&gt; &gt; the first things that came up was: seth blamed rest I am not
&gt; &gt; gare demon (all in that order). Needless to say this has me
&gt; &gt; concerned that whatever seth is is still with the box so I am not even
&gt; &gt; storing this thing inside of my house. I have an MP3 of the ovilus
&gt; &gt; saying this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also from my experience about 50% of the words it is saying aren&#x27;t on
&gt; &gt; the list. Chris Fleming has been getting words not on the list, and
&gt; &gt; Barry FitzGerald has stated that just over 50% of the words he is
&gt; &gt; getting are not on the list. Is there really a much larger list than
&gt; &gt; advertised or is this thing really magic? Highly doubtful IMO.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My most important question is is anyone else getting the name Seth out
&gt; &gt; of the Ovilus? How many people use this device here?
