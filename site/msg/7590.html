<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ron, have you tried a boosted Am or FM antenna?  ;)

&gt; Just found this about your new box.  Looks and sounds promising.  
But I suppose in my Land-of-Weak-Signals I would get nothing.  On the 
other hand, I almost feel I would sacrafice a volume of sessions and 
signals for good, clear, multi-word messages.  I am getting EVP block 
because I am afraid I will get nothing during a session or, worse 
yet, I may be getting messages but I cannot hear or understand 
them...if you get my drift.  Good stuff at your end.  Ron L

box 
&gt; I am testing that scans to strong signals only on the FM band, with 
&gt; scan rate and range adjustments. This method is different sounding, 
&gt; being somewhat choppy, but may yield clearer audio. The downside, 
as I 
&gt; have been discussing elsewhere, may be the lack of weaker signals 
&gt; between, and less white noise to be utilized. I&#x27;ll keep working 
with 
&gt; it and post my results as I have them. If spirits can manipulate 
&gt; audio, then this method may have merit, too. ;)
