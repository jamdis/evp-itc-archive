It shocked me that the device \ndetected so much. At first I thought it was speaking, as it sounds \nlike some sort of speech and the waves were actually good sine \nconfigurations.\nI will have to play around with the audio file and see if speed \nadjustment brings out anything, as you suggested.\nWouldn&#39;t that be cool if entities were using this as a form of \ncommunication...\n\nThanks,\n- Mike (UFO Geek)\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;threadsintyme@...&quot; \n&lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike,\n&gt; You did indeed, pick up energy.

It \n&gt; worked better than I thought it would.\n&gt; It&#39;s not a microphone but it picks up energy in the area and \nproduces \n&gt; waveforms.\n&gt; I&#39;ve produced a short video showing a demonstration of what it \n&gt; captured in two modes.
