Spiricom did use 13 tone generators as away of produce something l=\r\nike that raw audio. Then transmitted the tones a short distance so they cou=\r\nld modulated by the spirits. What I think we&#39;ve found is you don&#39;t have to =\r\ntransmit raw audio, the entities can manipuilate it in the electronics, it =\r\nwould seem. These days you can make four tone generators on a chip much sma=\r\nller then a dime. So you could have multiple tones in a small space, then w=\r\nith newer digital switching techniques, combine the tones in a way that wou=\r\nld similate speech bits. The goal as with all of this stuff is clear commun=\r\ncation. I think it is way too soon, and not enough work has been done for a=\r\nnyone to try to create theory of how this stuff work.   I used radio becasu=\r\ne it&#39;s a convienient source of raw audio, but becasue of noise, and the var=\r\niations in the number of stations in different areas, it makes it an unreli=\r\nable method. It works great here in Denver, it&#39;s not so good up in Cheyenne=\r\n, Wyo, or Grand Junction, Co.

Wasn&#39;t spiricom in essence a oscilli=\r\noscope/tone generator? I know it was considered for a while to be the most =\r\nsuccessful, but it was very electronic or synthetic in sound and required q=\r\nuite an operational budget and space.I think with your invention we have re=\r\nached the cusp of being able to create the walkman of EVP/ITC - we&#39;re almos=\r\nt there. And with the discovery of the Radioshack mod and the experience we=\r\n and others have had since your box first debuted I think we&#39;re almost to t=\r\nhe point where it will be very inexpensive to make a reliable box and/or so=\r\nmething that the average person could make following instructions.Of course=\r\n the holy grail is something that reliably generates clear voices every tim=\r\ne with little or no white noise. I know I read that someone was trying to c=\r\nreate a device that did that, created the white noise and then cancelled it=\r\n out, hopefully leaving you with just the voice.Oh, and a reliable televisi=\r\non ITC device would be quite the find too. I plan on creating a RS mod box =\r\nthat will be self contained and portable...and my thought was if it works r=\r\neliably I wonder if I could integrate a simply video ITC generator into it =\r\nas well. It would be great to be able to capture both audio and video.Anywa=\r\nys, carry on Frank. I know you&#39;re doing good work. IF you search the intern=\r\net for EVP and especially ghost box recordings your name is constantly popp=\r\ning up in the recordings, so I&#39;m guessing those communicating with us are q=\r\nuite happy with you.How does it feel to be the first known living person to=\r\n be a celebrity on the other side, lol?--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Fran=\r\nk Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Yeah, I do seem to get answers to =\r\nquestion with my Ghostman box (one of a kind Mini box). the Ghostman is a c=\r\nombinatin of the linear sweep and an AM/FM radio with direct out put, no so=\r\nund chamber or mics. I have kinda palyed wiht white noise, but not for abou=\r\nt six years. There&#39;s some ideas about using tone generators instead of radi=\r\no. &gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: overunder21@...: Sun, 2 Dec 2007 1=\r\n3:50:23 +0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] introducing myself&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not really new =\r\nto the group, been lurking for a few months just reading, listening, and st=\r\nudying.Unfortunately I&#39;m not much of an engineer so I&#39;ve been picking up bo=\r\noks to help me better understand the technical side of the boxes. I underst=\r\nand the practicality of them (ie- creating random white noise to allow EVPs=\r\n to be formed) but I hope to gain an understanding of how they work technic=\r\nally in hopes of building and tweaking my own.For me EVP has been something=\r\n I&#39;ve been into all my life without knowing what it was (I&#39;m 30 now, I firs=\r\nt learned the technical term about 22 or 23) - I guess I&#39;m what people woul=\r\nd call &#39;sensitive&#39; or whatever. But besides that, early on I was fascinated=\r\n by seemingly coherant sounds that would come out of random noise on my clo=\r\nck radio in my bedroom as a kid, from what sounded like voices (thought I w=\r\nas crazy for a while) to even morse code - for a long time one of my radios=\r\n would produce random clicks or pops even when the speaker was off. My dad =\r\njokingly suggested it was morse code, so I studied morse code and discovere=\r\nd that at least some of it could be morse letters...usually they would spel=\r\nl one word and then gibberish.Anyways, once I learned what EVP was I began =\r\nmessing around with recorders etc. My first clear recording came from using=\r\n EVP maker and was someone saying &#39;we have been waiting for you.&#39; A few day=\r\ns later, after a frustrating lack of communication they just told me &#39;build=\r\n a box.(this happened to be after I learned of frank.)&#39; I&#39;ve been looking a=\r\nt all the boxes and their positives and negatives and this is what I&#39;m seei=\r\nng:Franks models seem to produce the most consistant results but also seem =\r\nto be less two way than some others (ie Joe&#39;s Box.) Joe&#39;s Box and the new r=\r\nadio shack mod seem to have some very clear voices coming through but skept=\r\nics can argue that all you are hearing is snippets from radio broadcasts.My=\r\n thought for a cost-effective, low-tech alternative is to combine the two i=\r\nn that you create a radio shack mod like the UFOGeek one (multiple radios, =\r\na mixer, etc) and run it through an echo box.Personally I believe that anal=\r\nog is giving the best results overall, and I think it has to do with ease o=\r\nf manipulating the signal. Therefore my thought is taking a digital white n=\r\noise signal like that produced by the radio shack mods and then essentially=\r\n broadcasting it into the echo chamber and having a mic pick it up gives yo=\r\nu the analog aspect.My question is has anyone tried this? And I was hoping =\r\nfor thoughts on the pros and cons of using AM vs. FM or both.Oh, one other =\r\nthing- any programmers/engineers out there? Someone that could write code t=\r\no allow us to randomly band scan a digital radio? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ___________=\r\n_______________________________________________&gt; Share life as it happens w=\r\nith the new Windows Live.Download today it&#39;s FREE!&gt; http://www.windowslive.=\r\ncom/share.html?ocid=3DTXT_TAGLM_Wave2_sharelife_112007&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n____________=\r\n_____________________________________________________\nYou keep typing, we k=\r\neep giving.
