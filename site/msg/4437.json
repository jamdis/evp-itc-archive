I&#39;m still having a hard time convincing myself that I&#39;m not  \n&gt; matrixing this whole thing, but the box has been repeating the \nnumber  \n&gt; seven, the name Frank, the name Eva, had a bout of swearing, and \nthen  \n&gt; completely stunning me by seemingly saying that Tom was here, &quot;Your  \n&gt; Tom.&quot; Which blew me away because I have a great uncle named Tom \nwhose  \n&gt; burial records I was looking for just last night. Finally a female  \n&gt; voice told me, &quot;Ann stop.&quot; I said okay and she returned, &quot;Thank you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope no one minds my sharing. This is a big moment for me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt;"}
