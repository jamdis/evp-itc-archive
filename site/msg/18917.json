During the session, I was feeling a little bit self-conscious and discouraged, not sure if it would work for me alone, etc. so my mood was a little down, maybe negative.... also I&#39;m a relatively young female (28).  I&#39;m wondering if its due to those two factors that I received - upon going back to listen to the recorded session (I&#39;ll try to post files up later for confirmation)... a series of unwelcoming and vulgar messages...  toward the beginning of the session someone said &quot;you&#39;re too young&quot; and then a while into it I got &quot;h* cheats, hit me hit me hit me hit me&quot;... and then toward the end of the session I got &quot;a**hole&quot;.  (Frank, please let me know if I&#39;ve crossed the line as far as posting up vulgar words on this group - not sure how else to discuss my session, lol... and I do apologize)\n\nSo here&#39;s the thing, I can alter my attitude, to be more positive, but I can&#39;t alter my age and gender...  so any other females get vulgar messages like this? And what can I do about it?  What should I say?  I really have no desire to continue with these sessions if this is how I get treated...  I guess I was an easy target, just starting out with the ghost box, and not being a confident type, I&#39;m a shy, timid, walk-all-over-me type too often.... how do I &quot;administer discipline&quot; in this situation?  Does it work to just tell them to please stop it, or that you&#39;re not welcome if you don&#39;t behave, etc?  Or does that only egg them on further?  Help!"}
