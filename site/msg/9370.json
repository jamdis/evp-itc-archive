I so wanted to go see him, but we had a family\nemergency and I wasn&#39;t able to attend.\n\nI read that the man that invented the Luminator had a couple going in\na room. He sat down to meditate and when he put his head against the\nwall, his head went through the wall like it wasn&#39;t there. The\nLuminator must change the energy big time. I would be very interested\nin EVP capture when in the presence of a Luminator. Talk about Class A\n EVP&#39;s. LOL.\n\nHugs to your pups.\n\nBlessings All,\n\nJeremy\nNew York, NY\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@...m, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Jeremy.  Did you ever see the video on YouTube?  I&#39;m not finding\nit at the moment, but \n&gt; they video&#39;d one of the sessions.  It was quite interesting, but I\ndon&#39;t remember which \n&gt; researcher (it was a man) that was conducting the session.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jeremy Robert Huber&quot;\n&lt;JeremyRobertHuber@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The communication was done not via radio, but telephone directly to\n&gt; &gt; the researchers homes. There were numerous telephone calls made to\n&gt; &gt; Maggy Harsch-Fishbach, Mark Macy and even to Sarah Estep. These phone\n&gt; &gt; calls were made by members of the group on the Other Side working with\n&gt; &gt; ITC researchers during the 1990&#39;s. The group working with the ITC\n&gt; &gt; researchers were guided by seven Ethereal beings on the Other Side\n&gt; &gt; called The Seven. Contact was not only made via telephone, but also\n&gt; &gt; fax and files placed in Maggy Fishbach&#39;s computer. :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I highly recommend Mr. Macy&#39;s book, Miracles In The Storm. He has much\n&gt; &gt; of this information on his website. http://worlditc.org\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many Blessings All,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jeremy Robert Huber\n&gt; &gt; New York, New York\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And were using Hacked Radios to talk to the dead!
