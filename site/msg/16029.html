Frank,
I have meaning to ask you what you thought of the other inventors
th=
at were on the Queen Mary with you?
Were there some good ideas, or did you =
think they were full of crap ?
 Was there anyone you were a little impresse=
d with?
Your probably the only person that would be honest about it.....
 
=
Deb Fransen

[Attachment(=
s) from Frank Sumption included below] 



 Picked up another RCA alarm clo=
ck radio yesterday for $3. It's
hackable, although I'll convert it to a box=
 tuner by removing the
processor board. Cost is the motivator, this tuner i=
s $3, ---for the TRF
box, just the tuning diodes are $6, the TRF chip $1.50=
( i think), the
pcb board $20, plus maybe $20 for the rest of the parts, an=
d that's not
including assembly. Trouble is, I can't find a ready supply of=
 re-usable
tuners. This sounds alot better after it's converted.
