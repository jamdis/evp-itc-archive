<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I just go by what works best at the moment and i have only been doing 
sessions lately approx. once a week if that.  Look at my posts and 
see the lack of activity from me.  Work and other stuff has consumed 
my time and i have just recently been getting good communication and 
it happens to be with your box....you should be proud of your work.  
I have used Evp maker and i get minimal results with it.  Frank, 
random does work well and you should appreciate your accomplishment 
in designing that feature.  I no longer aske for technicians, i only 
ask &quot;Is there someone that would like to communicate with me today?&quot; 
and if they have trouble coming through i will ask for assistance in 
helping them get their message across to me.  As for telepathic 
suggestions, i have been hacking boxes and currently turned my band 
room into a giant Spiricom device and i would never know how to do 
these things.  They are putting ideas into my head all the time to 
better the communication, i open a box up and know what wires are 
what....that&#x27;s not me at all.  But it&#x27;s happening and i go with it 
and it seems to be pushing me and others on this board forward.

&gt;  Have ya tried EVPmaker? It is based on that random principle, and 
&gt; predates the boxes.
&gt; 
&gt;  I&#x27;ve heard this stuff before, about random being the best, and I 
&gt; have to disaggree. I also think it unwise to spend every waking 
&gt; moment doing sessions. I think it creates that expectation, and 
&gt; perhaps desperation to make contact, and I would tend not to trust 
&gt; what comes through. 
&gt; 
&gt;  I don&#x27;t trust some of this stuff because I have yet get any 
&gt; meaningful assistence with the boxes from the so called 
technicians. 
&gt; All I ever got was a telepathic &quot;suggestion&quot; to use the echo boxes. 
&gt; Everything else was a assemblage of stuff I had worked on in hte 
past 
&gt; to solve the problem of &quot;what else could I use&quot;. 
&gt; 
&gt;  I hate to see yet another go down the road of &quot;this is the onlyest 
&gt; way&quot;.
