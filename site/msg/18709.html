      Hi,



Since I don't =
use a droid or even a cellphone (except when I'm on the road), I won't pret=
end that I have a lot of experience with the Ghost Radar App.



However, I=
 did see it during a lunch in Canada last May.  Two (of the four of us) at =
the table wanted a message from a particular person.  The Ghost Radar began=
 saying things, including several words that -- to me -- clearly indicated =
the painting on the wall next to us.  



(When I'm not being a researcher/=
author, I'm an artist, so I'd noticed the painting's subject, medium, artis=
t's name, date, etc.)



The two people hadn't looked closely at the painti=
ng.  However, when they did, they felt that it included exactly the kind of=
 message they were looking for.



What most impressed me were their reacti=
ons.  Both are fairly accustomed to paranormal phenomena and the ways that =
people convince themselves that whatever-it-is is actually a message.



Ho=
wever, this incident seemed to have significance to them, and satisfied the=
m that they'd rec'd the message they were looking for.



It's just anecdot=
al and just one incident, but... well, there it is.  I think the Ghost Rada=
r is worth exploring if you already have a droid or similar tool.  And, for=
 the price... well, hey, why not!



I'll experiment with it more when I ac=
tually own something it'll run on.  For now, other research is a higher pri=
ority.



Cheerfully,

Fiona
