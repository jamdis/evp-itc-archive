<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I suppose, just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to post every voice one 
receives. That takes up alot of storage space after a while.

&gt; Interesting post, FS.  
&gt; 
&gt; I just like to think that everyone has their time and purpose.  
You 
&gt; receive what you are to receive for a purpose.  Others receive 
what 
&gt; they are to receive, for a purpose. 
&gt; 
&gt; It will all wash out in the end, Purple Princess of the Seven.  :)

&gt; &gt; From; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_St_Germain &#x27;Saint 
&gt; Germain is always associated with the color violet, the jewel 
&gt; amethyst, and the Maltese cross rendered in violet (usually the 
iron 
&gt; cross style cross patee version); he is also regarded as 
the &#x27;Chohan 
&gt; of the Seventh Ray&#x27;[13]  according to Theosophy, the Seven Rays 
are 
&gt; seven metaphysical principles that govern both individual souls 
and 
&gt; the unfolding of each 2,158 year long Astrological Age. Since 
&gt; according to Theosophy the next Astrological Age, the Age of 
&gt; Aquarius, will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) Ray (the Ray of 
&gt; Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes called &#x27;The Hierarch 
of 
&gt; the Age of Aquarius&#x27;. According to the Ascended Master Teachings, 
&gt; Saint Germain is &#x27;The God of Freedom for the Earth&#x27;.&#x27;
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  Much to do with the Purple Princess, and the seven. I don&#x27;t 
mean 
&gt; to sell others short, I just get a different level, and find 
&gt; regular &quot;this your auntie&quot; type EVPs kinda useless. Mostly I don&#x27;t 
&gt; post every voice I get, just the ones that I thought was 
outstanding, 
&gt; but no one else hears.
