R U Kidding me ?
This is Frank's group and I am here to learn how to make t=
he boxes and talk amongst other people
with boxes about what we get... we a=
re not here to listen to people who don't believe in what we are
doing or t=
rying to do.... If you don't have a box to work with or listen to, how can =
you be skeptical about
what someone hears regardless of whether they write =
out what they hear or not? Alot of times we don't hear
the same things ,so =
it is ridiculous for people to believe it's the power of suggestion.
RJ's e=
xperiments are to disprove for his own personal reasons, not to help this g=
roup in any way.
So, why don't you skeptical people and the ones who want t=
o try different methods and any other personal
ideas that you have, start y=
our own group?  This is Frank's group......
I personally want to see what F=
rank and Steve come up with and that's why MOST of us are here....
not to c=
riticize them..or try to do experiments disproving anything....

if frank will end tha=

prespectives, what is here wrong?

we must be prepared to all evidences, al=

maybe we can=
 learn something more and we can change our point of view. think about that=
.

i try to reach the goal of the "voices" with a sceptict mind, but i am e=

reach maybe one day =
something more convincing.

I re=
alize you have plenty of subjective anecdotal evidence.I don't consider tha=
t 'hard evidence' however.  I am looking for something a little more object=
ive and less subject to influence and interpretations.

And stop putting wo=
rds in my mouth. A person can misinterpret something, mistake something, or=
 confuse something, without lying about something.  And before you jump dow=
n my throat claiming I am saying all results are mistakes, I am not.  I am =
performing experiments, keeping an open mind, and considering all evidence =
I find.

The way you have been attacking me by calling me names at every tu=
rn, just because I try new things and don't always agree with your world vi=
ew, is eerily reminiscent of the way the church of old tried to suppress ne=
w thought and discoveries, except you're just substituting the word 'hereti=
c' with 'science'. and 'blasphemy' with anything that disagrees with you.

=
There's an old saying:  "We become that which we hate".  So far, all you've=
 done is denounce people's efforts to try new methods and see what works.  =
You accept nothing anyone else proposes if it does not agree with you.  Tha=
t is the realm of the extreme skeptic: the same skeptic you ridicule.

You =
certainly don't have to agree with my comments.  And I don't have to agree =
with yours.  But no one needs all the name calling Frank.   It really adds =
nothing to support your theories.

 Yeah I know, science no accept anecdotes.=

I don't think I have enough dat=

 different distinct claims about what the box or the recorders can do, I tr=
y to make different distinct experiments for each.

Some people claim they =
can get the box to tell them things that the operator couldn't know, so my =
"whats the object" experiment is one way to examine that.  Some people clai=
m the boxes can make predictions, so cataloging predictions and examining t=

 figure experiments based on those.
