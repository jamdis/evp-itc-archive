<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t wish to belabor this point too much further since it is not the focus of this forum. However this is so central to understanding phenomenology and PK does appear to be a potential root cause of at least some EVP and ITC work, so one more comment is in order.

As part of my research I reanalyzed many previously reported cases. I found a remarkable number where PK (including remote PK) was a quite plausible explanation. 

Consider also that in my work this is highly replicable phenomena. Replicable phenomena is defined as having a larger effect size than subtle less replicable phenomena. Many forms of mediumship and related psi are correctly defined as small effect size phenomena and hence far less replicable. This leads to the requirement to conduct extensive testing simply to establish correct statistical outcomes.

However as replicability improves so too does effect size (boiling water being an excellent example of a large effect size phenomenon that is of course highy replicable). As effect size and replicability increase the &#x27;rarity&#x27; of phenomena is no longer supported. Therefore I would contend, based on the above that indeed remote PK is in fact far more common than is commonly believed  and in fact this nicely explains not a small percentage but in fact a large percentage of many anecdotally reported phenomena.

&gt; Yes, I agree that it may be possible to have PK events occur remotely. 
&gt; 
&gt; Once we have ruled out all mundane explanations, and we think we have actual paranormal phenomena, then we consider what type of paranormal phenomena we are dealing with.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem with remote PK energy is that it is extremely rare, at least when it is without conscious intent. It is so rare, that it only exists in theory pretty much. It is a WAY more common occurrence that when we find any type of PK energy, it occurs only when the subject is present.

&gt; 
&gt;   It is not commonly understood that PK events do not require a local PK agent. While this is the far more common phenomenon, it is by no means the only way in which these events can manifest. I personally have conducted rigorous remote PK experiments many times over the years. This remote intention as it has come to be called is quiet real and remarkably replicable with the right people. This validated phenomena actually explains quite a few cases that are generally attributed to other, sometimes far more bizarre causes.
&gt; 
&gt;   Of course it makes sense to look for natural causes. However it is appropriate to consider alternatives if you have fail to locate plausible physical causations.

&gt;   &gt; There is absolutely no evidence pointing towards PK phenomena. The homeowners were not present during the investigation. These surges can easily be explained as mundane and therefore we must assume it is. If we can&#x27;t rule out all mundane sources, then we have to assume it is not paranormal.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; These were electrical surges. The only time we had EMF spikes was when these taps would be heard. The meter would spike, and then immediately return to 0.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; &quot;Do your readings in your notes? Were you reading electrical or magnetic
&gt;   &gt; fields? What type of EMF meter were you using?&quot;
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; Yes we logged all readings. We were reading EMF, so a bit of both. We had several types of meters present. At one point, we had 2 KII meters a few feet apart in the living room. On some taps, one would go off, and others, the other one would go off. Most spikes fell in the 2.5 mg range, but a couple went off the scale.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; It also explains some of the other activity the homeowners complained about-the touch lamp, kitchen lights dimming, etc.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; Again, these surges were constant, though not uniform.

&gt;   &gt; What I have been hearing on this since the first posting is a single
&gt;   &gt; tap that sounds like wood on wood. Since the tapping was continual
&gt;   &gt; and you noticed an EM spike there is another possibility.
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; You could have detected a PK event. In poltergeist cases we have come
&gt;   &gt; to realize that living PK agents often are responsible. These agents
&gt;   &gt; function in environments with specific characteristics and themselves
&gt;   &gt; exhibit specific traits. One of the environmental characteristics is
&gt;   &gt; an elevated magnetic field. Often this is a geomagnetic field as seems
&gt;   &gt; to be the case in extreme poltergeist cases. Less extremem cases, 
&gt;   &gt; such as this may be, we often see elevated EM field levels. Do your
&gt;   &gt; readings in your notes? Were you reading electrical or magnetic
&gt;   &gt; fields? What type of EMF meter were you using? This might help
&gt;   &gt; determine if the info you noticed was potentially related to PK
&gt;   &gt; effects.
