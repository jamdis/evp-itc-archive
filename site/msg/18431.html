Many of these people are just sour grapes, they wish they had thought of it

Rountree is not too bad. He is just what I term Uber-Rational.
If you can't replicate something in a lab setting, he will dismiss it.
In the absence of strong evidence, he will easily debunk things.
Rorke, on the other hand is an unprofessional boob!
I don't think that he is really a scientist, like he says he is.
He just likes to debunk WITHOUT strong evidence.
Rorke loves to bash Spiricom project.
While I believe that O'Neill MAY have been a fraud, or, at the very least, 
mentally ill, the other people involved in the project seemed to be quite 
sincere about the whole thing.
I have, so far, contacted 2 people involved with Spiricom-Hans Heckman & 
Bruce Dapkey. While they admit that O'Neill was a strange character, most of 
the folks working for Metascience really wanted the whole project to work.
I believe that most people who do GB work are also the same way. For every 
crackpot you may have many others who are serious and sincere about what 
they do. Maybe, their science backgrounds are weak, but, this stuff is an art 
more than it is a science. I think that a LOT of the paranormal is subjective 
and based on personal experiences. Its when you try to get "scientific" 
about it to prove phenomena to others is when you start to get into problems 
with methodologies and the collection/presentation of evidence.
It's VERY difficult to prove this stuff, especially, to someone who DOESN'T 
want to believe in it. Everyone is a skeptic until they have a personal 
experience.........including myself!!!!!!
I am still skeptical, but, I do leave the door open to the POSSIBILITY that 
the GB works. 
It does work...............SOMETIMES. 
Sometimes...............not so much.
Its good to try to be scientific, rational and objective. But, if you are 
TOO much like that, you may miss out on the personal, subjective and the 
fuzzy-headed stuff in life. 
Can love be proven in a lab?
Can religion be proven in a lab?
Can beauty be proven in a lab?
Maybe, beauty can be to a certain degree, but, you get my point.
Trying to PROVE that spirits are talking to you through broken radios is 
like trying to prove that baby pigeons exist!!!!!!
Have you ever seen a baby pigeon?????
Neither have I.
But, whenever I go to NY city, I am inundated with friggin' 
pigeons!!!!!!!!!!
