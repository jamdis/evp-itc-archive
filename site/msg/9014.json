Heck, even if someone brought me one so I could make the =\r\nhack for them I would do that.\n    \n    I tend to think the Mini-Box is a d=\r\nifferent category than the RS hacks just because of the manufacturing invol=\r\nved in the kits.  I think it&#39;s a little pricey and so I won&#39;t buy one, but =\r\nif they were cheaper I probably would out of respect for the person who wen=\r\nt through all of the trouble of getting them made.   \n\n    Now for the RS h=\r\nacks, there isn&#39;t any manufacturing involved, but opening it up, cutting a =\r\npin, and closing it.   It takes under a minute to do.  If the person was se=\r\nlling them right above cost for that minute of time, then I could believe i=\r\nn what they are doing.  But they are selling them at twice the amount.  Now=\r\n maybe I am a little deep involved with paranormal research and have always=\r\n done this for free over the years to help people and that&#39;s why I get a li=\r\nttle offended at people who want to rip people off.\n\n    That&#39;s one reason =\r\nwhy I really like this board is that everyone is willing to help everyone t=\r\no better forward the research and advancement of what we do and not make a =\r\nbuck off of it. :)  &lt;&lt;&lt;group hug&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nAll the best,\nBryan \n\n----- Original M=\r\nessage ----\nFrom: itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogr=\r\noups.com\nSent: Saturday, April 5, 2008 11:13:04 AM\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] Re: b=\r\noxes on ebay\n\n                Hi Bruce.

If a box=\r\n is not attainable for a new person yet, the right way. Then it &lt;br&gt;\nprobab=\r\nly is not their time yet.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I have coined a phrase and be=\r\nlieve in it. &quot;The researcher does not choose the box, the &lt;br&gt;\nbox chooses =\r\nthe researcher&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Be patient, those that do not yet have a box.
