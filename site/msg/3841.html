 I think maybe we beat Mr. Moon up enough. He did get the box out there in=
 the world, and has done some good with it. I think lets focus on our own w=
ork, and let the evidence play out as it will. 
 
 I support all mthods, an=
d think they all work, my boxes, the Mini Box, The Radio hacks, anything th=
at provides ths raw audio the entities can use, they will use. They use wha=
t we use, they have no limits. It's impossible for me to support, or endors=
e just one product, or reseacher. I just started the box thing, I don't thi=
nk what I do  should be the end all of it, or the final word. Let the evide=
