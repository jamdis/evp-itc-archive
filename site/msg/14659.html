&gt;  Why I&#x27;ve had enough of these insane idiots in the so called paranormal.
&gt; God forbid anyone should question their little pearls of wisdom flowing from
&gt; their sacred keyboards.
&gt;
&gt;  I&#x27;&#x27;ve said it before, and I&#x27;ll say it again, I do this work for my own
&gt; curiosity, I don&#x27;t seek fame and fortune like these others do, and I have no
&gt; ego to puff up to the world. I do not care if anyone uses my boxes, I don&#x27;t
&gt; even sell the crap. It ain&#x27;t gonna matter---the comet is on it&#x27;s way! Y&#x27;all
&gt; have three years, I&#x27;d use the time wisely.
&gt;
&gt;  I left the name off this, but anyone can probably figure out who sent it,
&gt; the same person that attacks many researchers in this field.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Frank,
&gt;
&gt; You have a big mouth on that piece of shit group evp-itc come over to
&gt; the---- group where I can respond to your fuckin retarded rants. You call me
&gt; a crack head, you senile old idiot, don&#x27;t hate people for being your
&gt; superior in the field just because your boxes are crap now and nobody uses
&gt; them for anything other than dust collecters. If I were you I would go back
&gt; into the bathroom sit on the bowl and think about what an obscure hasbeen
&gt; asshole you have become.
&gt;
&gt; Come to my group and open your mouth and I&#x27;ll take the wind right out of
&gt; your fuckin sails.
&gt;
&gt; All is possible, nothing is probable&quot;
&gt;
