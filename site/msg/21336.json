It fits in the palm of my hand.  I drilled holes and ran the wires from the radio through the casing to the sweep circuit.  \n\nBatteries for the board are in the enclosure with a sweep kill switch.  It has an adjustable sweep knob on top.  Radio is connected with strong 3M velcro, but can easily be detached to change the radios batteries when needed.\n\nHere is the video i just made, the voices i think are very clear to hear.  Sorry for the shakey filming, it&#39;s hard only using one hand to film and the other to work the ghost box.\n\nAs i described yesterday, it cost me under $50 to make.  \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1bPdO4pa2I\n\n\nThanks for watching,\n-Steve H."}
