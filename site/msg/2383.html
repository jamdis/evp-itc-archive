Yeah they turned out pretty clear even tho I hoped to get them even clearer with the patch cord, but I put it off too long because I have been too busy to think about much. Was a weird call, and it sounded like someone called on accident. You know how when your friends phone accidentally dials ya and you hear them talking but to someone else and after a while ya realize they dont know your there so ya either hang up or yell thier name hopin they hear you hehehe
   
  Was like that except I dont know whos phone it was from, and I didnt recognize the voices in the background, but after listening for a couple minutes I started to realize I was also hearing alot of static and there were words in that static. So I decided to hold it up to the mic and record it just so I could make it louder and stop wasting my phone minutes trying to replay it LOL
   
  Was quite interesting to get one of those. I'd read about others getting them but I usually keep the cell phone turned off and only use it for business or emergency and very few people have that # and they all know i dont use it much.
   
  They can call and waste my minutes any time they like. It wasnt a method I had planned on but never the less it got the messages thru. I used to hear it now and then as I would talk to someone I would get a static sound come thru and sometimes it would sound like they were speaking to me or would sound like a static voice said my name in the background while someone on the phone was talking. I just figured it was bleed over from another channel. Now I am not so sure.
   
  Every method so far has yeilded some impressive results. H2O, radio, ST, evpmaker, music, imagery etcetera... and now cellphone answerin machine LOL

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Cell Phone EVP

      Im releasing these to the public now, for those who have interest in this sort of thing. I had a phone message on my cell phones answering machine a few months back and I didnt have a plug to download it directly to the pc so I held off on sharing with everyone hoping I would get the cord I needed. However the message is no longer available (dont know what happened there LOL) so I will have to go for the version I recorded directly from the phone speaker itself.
