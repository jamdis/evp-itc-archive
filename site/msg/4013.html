<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Last night’s C2C show with George Noory on Frank’s Box and similar ITC
devices went well despite the limitations of the broadcast studio in
Sherman Oaks, CA.  We were just too well shielded for the boxes to
scan properly.  I had on hand my Frank’s Ghost Box 22, Ron Ricketts’
very first Mini-Box to come out of production, the Radio Shack Hack,
and a Craig’s Box, a modified Daewoo car stereo done by Craig Telesha.
 In addition, I had a gold-beryllium alloy antenna made by Marcus Leader.

There’s no doubt about it, the box technologies and spirit
communication are hot topics, and will continue to be in the
spotlight, especially as more people are able to obtain a device. 
Hopefully, this will lay to rest the nonsense about a “circle of 30”
or any such ridiculous claims of monopoly on who can and should use
boxes.  Box technology is already democratic.  As more people obtain
and work with them, many possibilities for coordinated research and
experiments will unfold.

As an interdimensional interface, the boxes are neutral.  They are not
dark, demonic, negative, etc., as some fearful people worry.  Negative
experiences are always possible, just as in any work in the
paranormal.  People who don’t know what they are doing, who are in it
for a lark, and who harbor fears and anxieties about the paranormal
are not well-suited to any kind of paranormal exploration, whether
it’s with a box, in automatic writing, or with a deck of Tarot cards.

Rick Moran, the executive director of the Association for the study of
Unexplained Phenomena, the sponsors of the research for the Mini-Box,
shared some observations with me after the show that illuminate the
topic.  Here are his comments:

There is a connection between every one of the designers/technicians
who have worked on the box from its inception by Spiricom. Every one
of them was a licensed Ham Radio Operator, including Frank, Ron and
Myself.

Someone asked about different antennas… because of the Ham connection,
that has been done already. The original Spiricom was an enormous
device and operated on the ham bands because it was the only part of
the spectrum that could offer a clear channel. They tried both
vertical and horizontal antennas. We did the same in our early
devices, both Ron and I have “antenna farms” as do many of the ASUP
investigators, who are also hams.

Spiricom sounded very robotic, due in part to the equipment being
used… tubes and crystals to set the frequency. This was common
practice through the 1980s.  I recently heard someone spouting a
theory that because the Spiricom used a crystal system, it was somehow
mystical in nature. Crystals were used in all ham radios, all military
radios and a lot of commercial applications… nothing mystical at all.
 
I think Frank dropped the crystal frequency generation due to cost in
favor of a plain old radio tuner he pulled from an old receiver. Most
of his designs were admittedly adaptations of junk radios, which is
what separates his from ours. We spared no expense in designing
circuits that were critical to a clean signal.

In your discussion last night, George did not even mention the EARTH
SOUNDS project at NASA on the Ultra Low Frequency Bands. Down there
NASA has been hearing “voices” for years, which they admit, they can’t
explain. As you might have already guessed, that is one of our
upcoming projects. The great problem there is the length of the
antenna, to do it right an ULF antenna would be buried and would be
about 11 MILES long.  In the production model of the MiniBox, Ron hand
tuned the antennas, winding row upon row of fine wire to match the
necessary length of the frequencies being scanned, another difference
that helped to eliminate noise and upgrade the voice quality.

Thanks, Rick.  And thanks to Frank, Ron, Craig, Marcus and all the
other researchers in the ITC field.
