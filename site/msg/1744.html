<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The only thing i lost was a switch for the ceiling fan so far, so i 
think that&#x27;s a good ratio.  Lights flicker and they shut stuff off 
and turn it back on, but nothing really breaks.  I really can&#x27;t 
blame them anyway, it was probably just a coincidence.  My house is 
200 years old and has only 60 amp service.

&gt; This stuff can get kinda weird. I had another box request recieved 
a via 
&gt; snail mail, asking for a &quot;digital box&quot;, I don&#x27;t know where they 
got idea. 
&gt; They also sent along a series of CDs that were excepts of 
channeled material 
&gt; talking about &quot;the telephone to the dead&quot;. I thought I would at 
least see 
&gt; what was on it, so started listening to the first CD, the dog went 
totally 
&gt; bonkers, running around the house barking and howling! I stpped 
the play 
&gt; back, and put the stuff back in it&#x27;s box to ship back.
&gt; 
&gt; The little that I did hear, as I kinda scanned through the first 
track, was 
&gt; pretty religious sounding, with some guy talking in a very deep 
mono tone. I 
&gt; don&#x27;t have time to try to sort that BS out, and I am not impressed 
with 
&gt; supposed spiritual revelations.  Ya reach a point after 40 years 
of reading, 
&gt; and other sources, that you develope pretty good BS detectors. I 
got 
&gt; interested in paranormal stuff when I was 13.
&gt; 
&gt; I also get the flickering lights, and thumps in the walls, but 
nothing ever 
&gt; burns up, or stops working, except from normal failure.
