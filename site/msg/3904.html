<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Last night on Ghost to Ghost PM I welcomed very special guest Kris 
Bronson, a.k.a. The Rocker Chick. For a full 2 hours Kris Bronson 
(The Rocker Chick) talked exhilaration ghost stories and told us 
about what&#x27;s new in the field of the paranormal. Kris discussed her 
recent investigation of The Stanley Hotel, and what it&#x27;s really like 
to search for spirits with our favorite celebrity ghost hunters. How 
she lives in a haunted house and what she sees and hears. About her 
scientific approach to a paranormal investigation.And she answered 
callers questions, as well as discussed some new EVP audio findings.
We even talked a bit about Frank&#x27;s Box, Chris Moon, and the 12-469 
mod on the show.
