As most of you know, I am about two weeks old now in this group, and I love it!  Very happy to be a part of this team of people with like minded interests.
   
  Have any of you used the Ghost boxes to assist with law enforcement agencies, and if so, how have they responded to any evidence you may have gathered from our spirit friends. 
   
  I know psychics are already working with police agencies now around the world, but the Ghost box is a whole different method.
   
  I know the media would have a field day with this, but I would be interested if any of you have received messages that have assisted the police in solving a crime.
