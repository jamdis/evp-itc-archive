I believe she is still adjusting to being on the other \nside and has not fully grasped how to send communication from the other \nside, with an array of different boxes to work with.\n\nI asked about the prior message concerning her whistle statement, the \nanswer I recieved was &quot;they whistled often&quot; I&#39;m assuming she meant her \nspirit contacts.\n\nThe files are posted in a sub folder marked MB_files in my main folder\nBruces box files. In the future all sub folders for different box files \nwill be in this sub folder.\n\nthanks guy&#39;s\n\nbruce"}
