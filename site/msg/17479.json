We seem to have the ability to change our perceptions and /or reality and create the conditions where fire doesn&#39;t burn the body. It&#39;s been way to long for me to have anything but a vague memory of the book. I think the quantum states of matter do manifest on the marco level, and can be effected by thought--yeah I know, where&#39;s the proof. \n\n F-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rj &lt;rasterer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for the pointer - it sounds interesting.\n&gt; \n&gt; My understanding of this idea is that there are weird things along those lines that happen with individual atoms and below that level.  But this does not apply (has never been observed) in normal life.  For instance, all the quantum theories or disbelief in the world is not going to save us  if we lie down in traffic.  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 6/3/10, April Abercrombie &lt;april@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: April Abercrombie &lt;april@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Tesing-testing\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, June 3, 2010, 6:27 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;       Frank did have a point there. There is some schools of thought that suggest that nothuing existis outside of ourselves, that we perceive and create our own realities. Things exist because we believe they do, calling them into reality. If you have ever watched the movie/documentary &#39;What the Bleep Do We Know?&quot; it explains this in detail using scientific principals.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I am not sure how much of it I agree with, but there is some truth to the thought that we create our own realities.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have not seen this movie, I can recommend it. Even of you don&#39;t agree with all of it, it does give you some interesting food for thought.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, Jun 2, 2010 at 4:33 PM, Rj &lt;rasterer@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;       Interesting.  I see science as being the basis for most of our lives.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 6/2/10, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@ gmail.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@ gmail.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Tesing-testing\n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, June 2, 2010, 11:58 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  I was just kidding, but personally I don&#39;t think there is a fixed, fundamental reality.

Quantum &quot;science&quot; sugggests that everytime anyone on the planet/universe has a discision to make an new universe is instantly created to accommodate both, kinda negates the speed of light speed limit wouldn&#39;t it, not to mention every other law of physics. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Yeah, I just don&#39;t see science being of much help with anything. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, Jun 2, 2010 at 12:38 PM, Rj &lt;rasterer@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Light is both a particle and a wave, depending on what you&#39;re looking for, or how you measure it.  That goes for everything on the electro-magnetic (EM) spectrum, of which light is part, but gravity is not.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; According to current science, there are 4 fundamental forces in the universe: EM is one, and gravity is another (and then the others I think are strong and weak forces at the atomic level). \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 6/2/10, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@ gmail.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@ gmail.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Tesing-testing\n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, June 2, 2010, 11:31 AM \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, it&#39;s light is a particle and gravity a wave?\n&gt;  \n&gt; F-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, Jun 2, 2010 at 11:07 AM, Rj &lt;rasterer@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; No gravity-particle has been discovered (graviton?).

I know that there is a delay with sound such as thunder, then the delay before an individual hears it depending on how far they are from where the sound originated.
