  It wasn't suicide, it was accidental:
 =
 Carradine Death Was Accidental

  IMDb, June 4, 2009

  David Carradine di=
ed during a sex game that went wrong, according to sources in Bangkok, Thai=
land, where he was found dead on Thursday.

  Carradine's body was discover=
ed in a hotel suite and local reports suggested he committed suicide. 

  H=
e was discovered by a maid, naked and hanged, but the suggestions his death=
 had a sexual twist were strongly disputed by the star's close friend, atto=
rney Vicki Roberts, and his manager Chuck Binder, who insisted he died of n=
atural causes. 

  But a statement from Carradine's representative now indi=
cates the actor died during a sex act.

  The spokesperson tells TMZ.com, "=
We can confirm 100 percent that he never would have committed suicide. It w=
as an accidental death. Everybody is in shock." 

  Rumours Carradine died =
attempting auto-erotic asphyxiation--where victims achieve heightened sexua=
l pleasure by restricting their air supply are backed up by a quote a Bangk=
ok police officer gave to British newspaper The Sun. 

  The cop tells repo=
rters, "A rope was attached to his neck and also to his penis". 

  Rocker =
Michael Hutchence was rumoured to have died attempting the same sex act in =
a Sydney, Australia, hotel room back in 1997--although his death was offici=
ally declared a suicide.

  Carradine was in Thailand to shoot the movie "S=
tretch." He was 72.
