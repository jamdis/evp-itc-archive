There is a movie called "What the Bleep Do We Know" which is along these li=
nes. Very interesting.

  Thought these =
comments might be interesting in light of recent
  threads. Dr. Sam El-Khaz=
en recently published an article in the
  Journal of Neuroquantology (study=
 of brain function at the quantum
  mechanical level). In this paper entitl=
ed "DNA The Gateway to
  Time", El-Khazen talks about the relationship betw=
een the structure
  of DNA, time, conscious perception and gravity. There i=
s credible
  evidence that these are intimately correlated. 

  An importan=
t finding for this group has to do with how we may in
  fact detect externa=
l influences in the physical world. If El-Khazen
  has it right, two EM wav=
es must align in order for the preception
  process to even begin. If this =
does not happen, there is nothing to
  perceive, even though we may be impa=
cted by an external potentially
  influencing EM wave. The second wave is g=
enerated from borrowed
  energy within our brain cells and is modelled upon=
 the structure of
  DNA strands. So yes we are impacted by billions of EM s=
ignals per
  second but we actually detect only a small portion of these th=
at we
  later process in the late-stage perceptual processes. 

  This woul=
d nicely explain why two people would perceive events
  differently despite=
 the fact that they were literally side by side
  witnessing the same event=
. Again this is strictly a matter of
  random probability, it seems to have=
 nothing whatsoever to do with
  volition or intention. That is more the fo=
cus of the later
  perceptual processing which is in turn dependent upon th=
is
  probabilistic process.

  This could also explain why it is that EVP a=
nd ITC signals are
  perceived differently by different people even when no=
 physical
  alteration to the media has occurred and why different things a=
re
  heard more easily at different times by the same person.
