Hello all !!
I have been lurking on the board for awhile, feeling not  much to 
contribute.
I am interested in this connection and  communication (Thanks to 
Debbie !!)
I've observed a few things on the  board. Somehow this word "purple" 
keeps popping up and I can't help but to  think of the color purple in 
the spectrum. Does the color relate to some  sort of sound wave 
also ? or correlates to something in the electronic  field that your 
helpers from the other side are trying to propose  ?

Also, I have noticed that the Frank boxes do not seem to be  
distributed to many women (is this because women do not have good  
results with the other side ?)
I know Debbie has done a lot of  successful work, but, does this mean 
that women have a more difficult time  with communication ?

I don't have a box and I don't know how to build  one !! I went to 
radio shack and whatever was recommended is replaced with  the new 470.

I don't know where to begin except that Frank recommended  starting 
with EVPMAKER. I'd like to build something of my own and don't  know 
where to start with a receiver/scanner of my own.
I'd be so happy  if someone could share some technology with me !!!??
thanks,  Holly
