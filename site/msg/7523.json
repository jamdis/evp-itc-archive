I actually just finished hacking one\nmyself.  It is almost sad that people say they are hacking a box. I\ndid the 12-470 model and it is as simple as unscrewing 5 screws, \ncutting one wire and putting the screws back in. Only important part\nis cutting the right wire. =) The video in the following link tells\nyou exactly what you and what you need to do. Hope this helps. \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN8iJjEq5Kg\n\nOnce at that site you should see some links for other videos for the\nRadio Shack Hacks.\n\nBest,\nToby"}
