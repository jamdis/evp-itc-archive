<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;d like to thank Mike for having me on his show last night, i had a 
great time even know i had to get over some early nervous jitters.  The 
show is also posted up on my site at keyportparanormal.com for those to 
listen to.  I put a link on my homepage to click and it will send you 
to my &quot;Radio Broadcast&quot; page and the show is the first one at the top.  
Again thanx mike for making me feel comfortable on there, i never do 
radio shows and that was the first one by myself.  Also thank you to 
those who listened Live last night.

-Steve H.</pre>
