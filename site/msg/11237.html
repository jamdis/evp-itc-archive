I remember a guy one time that tried to use a police scanner, and he never got it to work.  He was really educated in box research, but posted one time that it would not work.  Just to let you know.  If you think you can, give it a shot.  You might come across on something new.

Good idea - I never thought of that!

I'll have to try with my Yaesu VX-6R ham radio VHF-UHF transceiver in 
scanning mode on receive and see if I get anything.
