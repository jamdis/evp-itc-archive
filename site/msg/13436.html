I am pleased that the outcome for the family was positive. And I am not sur=
prised. The key I think is that a belief system was successfully altered. T=
his in turn likely impacted the focal person, who based on the limited info=
rmation presented could have been the young man. 
I am not saying the effor=
ts were ineffectual, just that the presentation sends the wrong message to =
the public and that there was lack of opportunity to gather information abo=
ut what to all=A0appearances may have been a legitimate example of PK pheno=
mena.

This phenomena occurs often enough that it has been extensively stud=
ied by some parapsychologists. It has been noted that there is often an abu=
ndance of magnetic field disturbances in such cases, both electromagnetic a=
nd geomagnetic disturbances have been noted, ranging from a few milligauss =
to several guass. These levels are quite high and are detected in the absen=
ce of any obvious natural sources. The investigators are trained in physics=
 and psychophysiology and so are expert in understanding=A0these conditions=
 and detecting natural sources for such fields.

It has been found that foc=
al persons (called PK agents) are often at the center of PK disturbances. N=
ot only does this result in object movement but it also results in seeing l=
uminous objects and smelling unexplained noxious odors among other phenomen=
a. Many of these were indicated in this specific case.

I would have done t=
wo things differently based on what I was able to discern about the case fr=
om the edited footage. First, I would have taken more extensive magnetic fi=
eld measurements the moment I realized that PK phenomena was being reported=
. I would want to determine the likelihood that such phenomena might in fac=
t be at the center of the reported outbreaks. If this appeared to be the ca=
se, I would focus on finding that focal person (or persons) and explain wha=
t is known about PK to the family. This would have included determining the=
ir health status looking for indications of physical disorders that might h=
ave environmental causation. These findings would add to the existing body =
of knowledge in this field and thereby help the family and the research.

S=

 is interviewed one by one and in some way their beliefs and the family rel=
ationship is carefully explored. This is important because such groups exhi=

 far more complex than potential spirit interactions or voices from the dea=
