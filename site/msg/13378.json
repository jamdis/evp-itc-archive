Modern researchers in this field will&lt;br&gt;have to stand on their own results anyway, and if they&#39;ve managed to&lt;br&gt;discover something that Edison never achieved, good for them!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have also heard varied claims: that Edison did make this box; that&lt;br&gt;Edison was working on it but never finished it; that Edison was joking&lt;br&gt;when he mentioned working on it. So for my own sake, I&#39;d like to know&lt;br&gt;the real story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have a link to where you got your information from his&lt;br&gt;assistants and staff, I would really like to read it. Please make&lt;br&gt;sure it is as close to the source material as possible, and not&lt;br&gt;someone quoting someone quoting an article.
