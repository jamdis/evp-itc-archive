The have to learn to help themselves. The only thing you can do to help the=
m is tell them to move on.

A friend of mine lives in a haunted house. He h=
ears loud popping noises before the onset of activity.

I am thinking it is=
 the sound of the spirit manifesting on this plane. Kinda like breaking the=
 sound barrier, only this would be the dimensional barrier.

In my Stanley =
Hotel recording, I talked to you about, there is some very loud popping noi=
ses.
