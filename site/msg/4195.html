<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>No extensive work yet.  I did several long sessions with April &amp; Allen
Slaughter (one with Mark Macy, too) at The Stanley Hotel in mid-Nov. 
-- that was the Mini&#x27;s debut.  I ordered one &amp; got the first one
available, which was delivered to me two weeks later on the Queen Mary
at another TAPS event.  The ship was bad for reception, but April &amp; I
were able to go offsite to test it out.  Then I had a couple of days
of working with it in LA.  The box is now in transit back to MD where
I live.  So the answer is, I haven&#x27;t been able to do a lot of
structured sessions yet.  Probably won&#x27;t happen much before Jan., as I
am away now most of Dec.  I would like to coordinate some blinds or
double blinds with other people.

The FB, which I have had since June, has seen more work.

&gt; Thanks Rosemary!
&gt; 
&gt; ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, have you had time to do any other communication sessions with 
&gt; your new MiniBox? 
&gt; 
&gt; Elaborating on the voice quality improvements with the MiniBox, and 
&gt; other positive results of your own, should be a big help to others 
&gt; deciding whether or not to grab one for their own experimentation. 
&gt; 
&gt; Since I personally know Ron, his thoughts, workmanship, ect... I&#x27;ve 
&gt; been sold on any concept of ITC equipment he might create since 
&gt; carrying own discussions for years running. Rick Moran deserves a big 
&gt; thanks for somehow coaxing him into finally building something that 
&gt; works! 
&gt; 
&gt; LOL!

&gt; &gt; Congrats, Lance.  You&#x27;ll really like it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the clarification, Rosemary and April.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I just got great news! Ron&#x27;s personally going to be bringing to 
&gt; my 
&gt; &gt; &gt; new Mini to the DAPS group meeting next Tuesday!! 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve heard such positive feedback, from him and others, I can&#x27;t 
&gt; wait 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to start experimenting. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; As positive communications with the Mini are established, I&#x27;ll 
&gt; make 
&gt; &gt; &gt; sure other researchers are in the loop.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the specs side, the MiniBox has controls for both scan rate 
&gt; as 
&gt; &gt; &gt; well
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as sensitivity, so you can cut down on the amount of random 
&gt; noise 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also find a speed which seems clearer, whereas you cannot with 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; RS
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hack (as far as I know). The rechargeable battery lasts about 
&gt; 40-50
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hours on one charge... nothing to replace that way. It has both 
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speaker output and one for a recorder so you can not only hear 
&gt; it as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loud as you like, but you can directly record your session from 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; box.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When it comes to audible differences, the quality of the 
&gt; electronics
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used provides clearer sound. I am not straining so much to hear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things. It is just speculation on my part, but it seems to take 
&gt; less
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time and less effort for communication from the other side to 
&gt; come
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through with the Mini. At least, in my experiences with both 
&gt; &gt; &gt; devices.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though, I have gotten snippets from the RS Hack that were 
&gt; &gt; &gt; impressive.
