I think another form of experiment is to see what predictions people think =
they get, and then compare them to actual events.

To do that though, we'll=
 need real dates with years.=C2=A0 And specific events, not vague things "S=
omething *bad* happens *someplace*=C2=A0 :)

I will mark this one down.=C2=
=A0 I have:

Date: March 2011
Event: President Obama resigns

Let me know i=
f that is accurate for your understanding.

I can't add "Earthquake" since =
there are earthquakes every day, and we'd need more specifics on place, tim=
e, and effect I think.
