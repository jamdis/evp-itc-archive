Unfortunately most of my writing is white papers and technical 
reports, so I tend to write dryly. I also write several hundred e-
mails a day, as I field a lot of questions about the research we are 
doing at the SPIRIT lab. So If I have a perceived tone, it is 
unintentional.

My approach to the whole EVP/ITC issue is strictly common 
sense/scientific. I well know that most people are not doing what I 
am doing, and I don't expect them to. What I do is post what we do, 
and let other people duplicate it if they wish. By following strict 
testing protocols, we are able to seperate the wheat from the chauff 
so to speak. The thing is, people are entitled to their beliefs, at 
least so far. I am not so much interested in beliefs, but in finding 
answers. So I admit my approach is somewhat different. But the by 
product of my approach is one day I may be able to say you can 
communicate with the dead, and this is why, and produce the viable 
evidence. While many of you don't understand my motivations, what 
that may lead to is a branch of science, grants for research, and new 
discoveries that apply to many aspects of science.

Or not.

The important thing is to study the validity, probability, and 
source. I mean, what if ITC doesn't work, and the effects you are 
experienceing are due to something completely different? Proof is 
required to answer questions, and that is all I try to do. A healthy 
application of Occam's Razor and objectivity keeps me focused on the 
questions and the search for the answers to them.
