Gotcha. Thanks. I do understand what you are saying. It does help to know t=
hese things.

Now how about with analog recorders. How would that work?

        Your points seems to be that you can make it work w=
ithout knowing how it works.  So we need to talk about what you mean by tha=
t.

        When you use the microphone, you just speak, and let the record=
er do the rest.  In this case, you are using the recorder without really kn=
owing how it works.   If a spirit can manipulate the EMF field around the A=
toD converter (even without using the mic), then they should be able to do =
the same: just use it without knowing how it works: the recorder does the r=
est.  In neither case do either of you need to know how it works, to get it=
 to work. I am not questioning this.

        But, if they are going to cha=
nge the bits on the actual media themselves, then they must know how it wor=
ks, it order to get all those bit-things I mentioned right.  The recorder c=
an't "do the rest", because by changing the bits on the media themselves, t=
hey are going completely around what the recorder does, and doing the detai=
ls themselves.  And as I said, the details there are very technical, and in=
clude things like converting their words into digital samples of groups of =
a specific number of bits in a specific format on specific places in specif=
ic orders with other specific other bits connected to them like file owners=
hip and dates and such.  It is the job, basically, of a computer, not a per=
son.

        If they are changing the bits on the media, then the recorder=
 is not doing that.  They are no longer letting the recorder "do it", like =
you or they would be if they just used it normally.  The reason you can "ma=
ke it work" without understanding it, is because the recorder is doing the =
work for you.  If they are to change the media directly, then the recorder =
is no longer doing the work, and so they must understand all those digital =
issues.

        So that is the difference between being able to use it wit=
hout understanding it, and not being able to use it.

          That's what I'm sayin' LOL! They wo=

          I don't=

      <TD vAlign=3Dtop>Your points seems to be that you can make it w=
ork without 
        knowing how it works.  So we need to talk about w=
hat you mean by 
        that.<BR><BR>When you use the microphone, you just=
 speak, and let the 
        recorder do the rest.  In this case, you =
are using the recorder 
        without really knowing how it works.  =
 If a spirit can manipulate 
        the EMF field around the AtoD converte=
r (even without using the mic), 
        then they should be able to do the=
 same: just use it without knowing how 
        it works: the recorder does=
 the rest.  In neither case do either of 
        you need to know how=
 it works, to get it to work. I am not questioning 
        this.<BR><BR>Bu=
t, if they are going to change the bits on the actual 
        media themse=
lves, then they must know how it works, it order to get all 
        those =
bit-things I mentioned right.  The recorder can't "do the 
        res=
t", because by changing the bits on the media themselves, they are 
       =
 going completely around what the recorder does, and doing the details 
   =
     themselves.  And as I said, the details there are very technical,=
 
        and include things like converting their words into digital sampl=
es of 
        groups of a specific number of bits in a specific format on =
specific 
        places in specific orders with other specific other bits =
connected to 
        them like file ownership and dates and such.  It=
 is the job, 
        basically, of a computer, not a person.<BR><BR>If the=
y are changing the 
        bits on the media, then the recorder is not doi=
ng that.  They are 
        no longer letting the recorder "do it", li=
ke you or they would be if 
        they just used it normally.  The r=
eason you can "make it work" 
        without understanding it, is because =
the recorder is doing the work for 
        you.  If they are to chang=
e the media directly, then the recorder 
        is no longer doing the wor=
k, and so they must understand all those 
        digital issues.<BR><BR>So=
 that is the difference between being able to 
        use it without under=
standing it, and not being able to use 
        it.<BR><BR><BR><BR>--- On <=
