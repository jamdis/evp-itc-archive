Does Nostradamus agree with the Mayan calendar about a coming change?

By S=
tephen Wagner, July 13, 2009

On July 10, 2009, The History Channel aired a=
 two-hour documentary on the prophecies of Nostradamus and how they might r=
elate to 2012. It was the latest in a growing heap of information, theories=
, fears, warnings, enlightenment and anxiety about the year 2012, so perhap=
s it's time I throw in my two cents. 

I have never put much stock in the s=
upposed Mayan prophecy that 2012 will mark the end of the world, the end of=
 an era or however you want to view it. I mean, haven't we been through thi=
s countless times? Some predicted May 5, 2000, as doomsday because the plan=
ets were in rough alignment. Then there was the hysteria over the millenniu=
m and Y2K. And of course various religious cults have named date after date=
 when the world would surely end, all of which came and went without so muc=
h as a hiccup. 

The year 2012 will be no different. Yes, the subject is se=
lling a lot of books, drawing large audiences for talk radio and counting u=
p lots of hits on websites, but I think that's the most drama we'll get out=
 of 2012. It, too, will come and go without a major shift on the planet. Do=
n't we all really know that? 

Those promoting the 2012 changes have thrown=
 out a wide range of possibilities for what might happen - everything from =
a literal end of the world, to dramatic social, economic, political and cli=
matic upheaval, to a "spiritual awakening," which, of course, could mean al=
most anything.

Why 2012?

And what is it based on? Primarily, it's based o=
n an ancient Mayan "long count" calendar, carved on stone, which according =
to calculations ends on December 21, 2012 and marks the end of a 5,126-year=
 era. Without a doubt, the ancient Mayans were remarkable mathematicians an=
d astronomers, but can we really take this "prophecy" seriously? First of a=
ll, it's not even a prophecy. It happens to be when their long count calend=
ar ends. Why should that hold any significance for us? 

The second reason =
proponents of this coming apocalypse say it is on its way is that in 2012 t=
here will be an alignment of sorts with the center of our galaxy. Because t=
he Earth wobbles slowly as it rotates (once about every 26,000 years) the s=
un will appear to rise in alignment with the center of the Milky Way. Inter=
esting, yes, but there seems to be no cosmological evidence of any kind tha=
t this should have an effect on our planet, physically, socially or even sp=
iritually. 

The third reason touted is that the sun is scheduled to be at =
a "solar maximum" in that year, a time when sun spots and solar flares are =
very active. This kind of activity really can cause problems. Such activity=
 can disable and damage satellites and can have a dramatic effect on the Ea=
rth's weather. The schedule is based on past patterns of such activity, but=
 we have no way of knowing whether it will happen in 2012, and if it does h=
ow severe it might be. 

Strained Interpretations

Back to the Nostradamus =
documentary for a moment. As usual, the Nostradamus experts quoted a select=
ion of his quatrains - those that feature famine, pestilence, war, etc. - a=
nd strained to tie them into 2012. Not successfully, in my opinion. The wor=
ld has always been plagued with famine, pestilence, war and the rest of it,=
 and I saw no quatrain that even remotely indicated that what Nostradamus w=
as talking about was the year 2012.

Aside from the quatrains, the document=
ary focused mainly on the so-called "Lost Book of Nostradamus," which was d=
iscovered in a modern library in Rome in 1994. Dating to 1629, the manuscri=
pt, filled the bright watercolor drawings, is titled Nostradamus Vatinicia =
Code and has on the inside the name Michel de Notredame as the author. Firs=
t of all, although this "lost book" is thought by some to be the work of No=
stradamus, there is no definitive proof or scholarly consensus that he was =
actually the author; some experts have serious doubts. So to make this book=
 the platform for this documentary puts it on very shaky ground. 

And then=
 the lengths to which the talking heads on the show reached and strained to=
 connect the drawings to 2012 was positively ludicrous. For example, the dr=
awing of a sword, held pointing up and around which is looped a banner or s=
croll (see illustration above) - this was interpreted as the sun's alignmen=
t with the galactic center in 2012. Really? The other drawings were likewis=
e twisted and mangled to fit the interpretations needed for the argument. W=
e all know that we can take such enigmatic drawings - and quatrains - and i=
nterpret them to fit virtually any scenario that we want. 

So What Will Ha=
ppen?

Why are some people obsessed with 2012 (apart from its marketing asp=
ects)? Why are they obsessed with apocalypse and the end of the world? Why =
is it always seen as right around the corner? 

I think the answer is that =
we both fear and want great change. As wonderful as the world can be, it is=
, as noted earlier, continually plagued by war, economic difficulties, fami=
ne and climate shifts. This stuff is not new. They are continuing problems =
that ebb and flow on the planet. While we fear that it's going to get worse=
 (and it certainly can get worse), at the same time we have the hope that i=
t's going to get better. We fear the catastrophes of an apocalypse, yet we =
hope for that spiritual awakening that will save us from our own human natu=
re. 

I'm no Nostradamus, but here's my prediction for 2012: the world will=
 continue on pretty much as it has in the past. There will be dire problems=
 and there will be great joys. Perhaps some problems will get a bit worse t=
han they are right now, but there will be no earth-shattering catastrophe. =
If there is a spiritual awakening, it won't be on a planetary or mass scale=
 through some unspecified miracle, as some hope, it will be as individuals.=
 (But that has nothing to do with 2012.) The best we can shoot for is that =
as individuals we do our best to make our own small fragments of the Earth =
better places. This has always been the case and ever shall be.
