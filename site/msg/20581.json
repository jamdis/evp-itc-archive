Manual--as in done by freaking hand, as in touching the\n&gt; &gt; godamn dial!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Yeah, I am pissed, cuz no matter what I say it is completely ignored in\n&gt; &gt; favor of the idiotic ghost hunter rap. Y&#39;all don&#39;t understand the sdimplest\n&gt; &gt; concepts of spirit communcation, but I bet 90% here will claim to be box and\n&gt; &gt; paranormal experts.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Those that do get it, I&#39;m told are too f--- lazy to turn a radio dial, yet\n&gt; &gt; are somehow more qualified to get higher spirit communication.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  I don&#39;t know what to say, I thought I was totaly fed up before.... Just\n&gt; &gt; keep chasing yuur retarded lime lights--that&#39;s fame a fortune that 99% here\n&gt; &gt; are really after, and forget I was ever here!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Supposedly you have to crawl before you walk, y&#39;all want to skip crawling,\n&gt; &gt; and walking and fly the space shuttle.
