This is what I think true EVP is Eric. Not and actual sound emitting a soun=
d wave in the environment, but EMF manipulation in order to imprint the mes=
sage directly to the recording media. It doesn't matter if it is analog or =
digital.

If the sound that is recorded emitted a sound wave in the physica=
l environment, then it is really a disembodied voice, and not true EVP.

    2 different things happening-that's why. When you get EVP that ever=
yone understands, it is outward, in the environment. Not a communication th=
rough subconscious means.



    EVP that people swear they hear, but noone=
 else can make sense, may be a message to them via subconscious means. That=
 isn't to say that ALL EVP's like this are true messages, I am sure alot ar=
e just matrixing.



    But then that is how the art of scrying starts-mat=
rixing. Like the Rorschach tests. The images you matrix with those gives th=
e psychologist an insight into your mind.



    By gazing into a dark, ref=
lective surface, you start to see cloudy images. At first, you will just be=
 matrixing faces in the clouds and not getting much substance. Try it, you =
will see what I am saying. With practice, you start to see clear, concise i=
mages.



    I think that is what happening with audio as well.



    We =
already know for a fact pareidolia can occur in audio as well as visual sti=

 me I should not have to work them over till I hear them.  Yes taking out t=
