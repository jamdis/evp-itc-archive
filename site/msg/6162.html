&gt; Hi Ann,
&gt; 
&gt;  I sent you an email I don&#x27;t know if recieved it yet or not about the 
&gt; Chadds Ford case. Our group would be interested in seeing if we can 
&gt; help them. Also with any help from people in this group. Just wanted 
&gt; to see what you think about it. Our group pays strict attention to all
&gt; privacy. I have learned alot from a Podcast on Ghost to Ghost PM with 
&gt; Mike Coletta and his guest Bruce Halliday about the Ghost Box and 
&gt; opening a portal with the thing that I emailed about. The shadowy 
&gt; figure that followed me home that I think came through the Box. Oh 
&gt; well Ann have a great day and everyone on here too.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
