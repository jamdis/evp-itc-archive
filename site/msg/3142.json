I was also\nhappy to meet Frank for the first time!   I had several sessions with\nthe Mini-Box with April and Allen Slaughter of the Association for the\nStudy of Unexplained Phenomena, and found it quite impressive.  Very\ncompact, long battery life (and rechargeable) and good clarity.  &quot;Seven&quot;\ncame through for me in every session.  We had a session with Mark Macy,\nand a short one with Frank -- wish it could have been longer.  I&#39;m\ngetting one of the first of these boxes, and it will be a valuable\naddition to the two Frank&#39;s Boxes that I&#39;m working with.\n\nI haven&#39;t reviewed the recordings yet, as I just got home.  But we got\nmany clear responses to questions.\n\nRosemary"}
