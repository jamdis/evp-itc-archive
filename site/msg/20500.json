The only way to validate what you hear is true, would be to follow up with something that you got that actually happened.\n\nHave you ever heard a message that came true that nobody else heard, basically validating your experience?\n\n-Steve\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I keep getting these messages that this  Egyptian thing will escalate into \n&gt; a big war, but some of us will not be  here to see it due to the \n&gt; resurrection aka rapture.  Go on and laugh,  but don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t let you all know, \n&gt; not going to say anymore, ( I know,  what a relief ! right?), we all know in \n&gt; our hearts how we feel about  things.  I keep getting these kind of \n&gt; messages, and so feel compelled to  let everyone know.  I was also told those that \n&gt; are stuck here, will be  stuck here for almost 3 years, and will be those \n&gt; that don&#39;t believe in what JC  did for them.  These spirits insist that He is \n&gt; the only way to life.   sf\n&gt;"}
