<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am scheduled to do an investigation on Saturday. Let me say, I have
very little experience with investigating, and have really only

investigate a residence described as very active. Lots of class A
EVPs, supposed incubus/succubus activities, described as an
infestation. What are your thoughts on known demonic entity
investigations?</pre>
