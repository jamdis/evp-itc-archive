<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have had that thought and have had a couple instances where that might be
true. But I have a lot of evidence that contradicts that, too.

I like to make recordings in all sorts of places, some supposedly haunted,
some not supposedly haunted, some have no reason to be haunted (like a
brand-new shopping mall) and the responses or lack of them is totally
unpredictable.

I&#x27;ve been in several of the supposedly most haunted cemeteries in Illinois
many times, day and night, and recorded several hours of audio in them,
asking questions that might get an EVP response. In some I got nothing.
Other cemeteries that were supposedly haunted got some responses. A lot of
other places (old and new buildings, etc.) also seemed to get a few EVP
responses occasionally and at other times nothing.

So all I can say is that what happens, happens. I can&#x27;t predict it. This
observer in particular doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lot to do with the presence or
lack of responses and what those responses will be.

So why spend time ghost huntig if you think there&#x27;s nothign to it? And- I
think expectations can create/allow the conditions you want to experience or
investigate. You want to get EVP, but you want to be able to explain it
away. Too Freudian perhaps?

 I am pretty sure all this paranormal business operates on the quantum
level, you can&#x27;t seperate the events from the observer. All one can really
do on this level is participate.
