I just completed the hack\nfor the\n&gt; RS20-125...AND....halfway through the first sweep, I heard my name! This\n&gt; is awesome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Carol B.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just picked up and modified the RS 20-125.  Before I gave it a test\n&gt; &gt; run, I made it clear I was only doing a test and that I did not intend\n&gt; &gt; to make any contact.  About half way through the first sweep, I heard\n&gt; &gt; my name.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Very exciting and somewhat startling at the same time.  Hopefully I\n&gt; &gt; can get time to do an actual session tonight.  I understand it can\n&gt; &gt; take some time for the box to get &quot;imprinted&quot; as Bruce says.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you Steve for finding this hack and thanks to the others here\n&gt; &gt; for your endless help to everyone on the board.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jeremy\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
