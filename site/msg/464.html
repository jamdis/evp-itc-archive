<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Andrea;

 With the attack I got from this woman, I don&#x27;t think she would even
bother to listen to the voices, I think she was a debunker, caring not
at all for truth, and doing what ever she, and her kind can do to make
it go away. She was not the first one to claim the voices were fake, the
first I heard of that was from Haunted Voices, the &quot;other&quot; magazine. My
aim was that if theses debunkers claim all my voices are fake, all I
have to do is provide one that can&#x27;t be explained, or duplicate to make
the debunkers liars. 


 It&#x27;s true I can get upset, and rant and rave, but I never lie.
