Since=
 we're talking about experiments and protocols here are some  ideas to 
imp=
rove
the protocol RJ suggested initially. Using a test target is one  way o=
f 
establishing a 
truth in time, which is the basis of this experiment. Bu=
t there  are a 
couple of issues.
 
It is quite possible that someone could=
 discern the target  through remote 
viewing alone.
This would negate the n=
eed for involvement of a spirit  communicator or 
discarnate entity.
Outcom=
es depend on the word of those reporting. The true  skeptic (not 
cynic) wo=
uld 
therefore say that this experiment contains a basic flaw in that  it d=
oes 
not uniquely 
indicate that the information was obtained in the prescr=
ibed  manner. 
Providing access
to the raw audio file would not necessarily=
 constitute proof  either, since 
many of these 
communications can only be=
 heard by certain people, 
 
If the audio file were quite clear, timing  be=
comes an  issue. In other 
words, when was 
the audio actually recorded?  T=
his issue can be mitigated  simply by 
requiring any
claimant to email the =
audio file to a trusted party before the  test ends. 
It would be best 
if =
the trusted party were not otherwise involved in the  experiment and it 
wa=
s  their duty 
simply to collect the claims. Once all claims had been  coll=
ected they 
could be posted 
publicly for review by the community in genera=
l.  The  experimenter could 
decide if any 
of the claims seemed to have hi=
t, and this decision could be  reviewed by 
anyone if desired. 
 
The impor=
tant detail however is that this experiment does not  completely 
answer th=
e 
question. It is a first attempt and certainly can be improved on  
succe=
ssive trials.
 
Successive trials are always a good idea, since it provides=
  replication. 
And it would be
best if others replicated the experiment us=
ing a very similar  protocol. If 
these were to
succeed, the community coul=
d then state that out of X trials Y  had 
succeeded (by 
some definition of=
 success) potentially giving a success  rate above that 
expected 
by rando=
m chance. This would make the outcome quantifiable and  measureable 
and th=
us meaningful.
 
But also important to note, this would only prove the pote=
ntial  veracity 
of the messages.
It would not (and cannot as far as I can =
tell) prove the origin  of the 
messages. This detail
will, I fear, remain =
a matter for belief and speculation for  quite some 
time to come.
