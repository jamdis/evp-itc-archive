       =
 Hertz measures frequency in cycles per second.  Not strength.
        And =
it can be used to measure the frequency of anything (for example, sound), n=
ot just EMF.

        Gauss is more complicated.  It seems to be the satura=
tion or density of magnetic flux, which relates to the strength of a magnet=
ic field, which relates to the strength of EMF.

        Or something like =
that.

          Recently someone asked me the following question:

    =
      [I am brand new to the world of paranormal investigation. I believe I=
 have a good grasp on what hertz and gauss measurments are, however am conf=
used as to all of the differences between them. Hertz has more to do with t=
he complete cycles per second and gauss is the strength of an EMF. I guess =
where I am fuzzy is in my lack of physics. I thought frequency is also a me=
asurment of strength. I may not be making much sense here, but can you tell=
 me where I am missing somthing?]

          My answer was that I wasn't en=
tirely sure myself but I think that Hertz measures the wave frequencies of =
the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Gauss only measures the intensity or s=
trength of EMF generated around these wave frequencies. Depending on the ra=
nge of hertz, an EMF is generated.

          I told him that I would check=
 around with other people in the field to make sure.

          Was I corre=
ct?

          Thanks!
          April
