Getting some interesting responses. I think Frank asked a very good  
quest=
ion so let me explain who I am, what direction I am looking at this from  a=
nd 
perhaps my own personal belief systems.
 
My name is Dwayne Claud and I=
 have worked in the area of demonology now for 
 over ten years. Yes still =
a youngster in the area but then again isn't 
everyone  given the life of a=
 demonic and angelic entity. My professional 
background comes  from one of=
 therapeutic nature with advanced studies in 
therapeutic  hypnosis.
 
My p=
ersonal belief system is that a ouija board or spirit board really is  
not=
hing more than a piece of cardboard and a piece of plastic placed upon 
it.=
 It  is the intension that is placed into the object that opens the 
doorwa=
y. I do  believe though that an individual, at least one, needs to have som=
e 
sort of  mediumship ability in order to use one successfully. I have wat=
ched 
individuals  who have worked on a board that have had nothing happen =
and 
others where lots of  information have come through - I personally hav=
e had a 
planchette shoot  across the room.
 
I understand the concept of i=
deomotor and the micro-movements of muscles as 
 a response from the subcon=
scious. This is a valid theory when it comes to 
the  use of certain divina=
tion tools such as dowsing rods and pendulums, 
ouija boards  are much larg=
er tool and steps outside of the ideomotor concept 
due to the  larger musc=
les which would need to be used. This would also be 
true of table  tipping=
. The interesting concept is when information comes 
through the board  tha=
t the participants are not privy too - for instance, I had 
a spirit once  =
bring through a name in Hebrew, which looked like garbage to 
me until I be=
gan  to research it further. This also does not account for 
the events whi=
ch  sometimes happen in the environment itself - with ghost 
boxes, don't y=
ou often  feel environmental changes as it is used? 
 
As for Bloody Mary, =
certainly it is considered folklore but then legends  
and folklore do have=
 some basis in reality. Occult practices from around the  
world have used =
mirrors as a scrying tool for spirit communication. Again, 
it  comes down =
to intension. 
 
I am certainly open to the possibility that nothing happen=
s when these  
devices or rituals are conducted - but also are open to the =
what if  something 
does. This is why I am researching all facets of these =
experiences  among 
others - also planning to do some extensive experimenta=
tion around such  
events to see what scientific data can be collected.

Yes, you can get get operator influence with any of these methods,  but it =

As has been said, one of  the most l=
ikely explanations for  the Ouija is 
the working of the mind.
What is some=
what at issue, as is so often the case when discussing  
apparent discarnat=
e 
communications, is the actual source of the apparent  intelligence.
 
Mi=
cromuscular reactions do indeed appear to be one source of the Ouija  
when=
 operators are
in contact with the planchette. But this is only one categor=
y of Ouija  
interactions. There is
another completely different category w=
here no operator is touching the  
board or the planchette,
and yet it move=
s and remains in motion, often changing directions or  
flying off the boar=
d. This
type of activity is more akin to psychokinesis, the mind affecting =
the  
environment.
 
Both types of activity could be mediated in the mind o=
f a living  operator, 
and in fact modern
parapsychology research suggest t=
his is the most reasonable  explanation. 
But again the 
source of the info=
rmation thus presented is at question and is  currently 
unknown.
 
Against=
 this backdrop it would seem that it would be quite difficult to  
demonstr=
ate with
any clarity or precision that any specific individual (living or  =
deceased) 
was indeed affecting
the Ouija (or any other device for that mat=
ter). It would all come down  to 
beliefs which is the
best we can hope for=
 at this time.
 
So 'scientific' proof per se is off the table if you defin=
e  'scientific' 
in the classic sense.
If you mean objective proof, in some=
 way documenting activity such as  by 
video for example,
that is a differe=
nt matter. But to be very clear, this would not be  
considered scientific =
proof
because you are cannot demonstrate the causation. You can however  do=
cument 
the effect.
 
Blood Mary (the ritual of Mary Worth) is considered b=
y most to be  
folk-legend. So it would 
be difficult, would it not, to asc=
ertain who in fact you were  
communicating with. And again, 
there is a re=
al possiblity, based on existing lab research from  the past 
many decades =
that 
you just might be communicating with yourself.
 
Best of luck in your=
 endeavors!

Hey guys,

I am doing some research on the Bloody =
 Mary ritual and Ouija Boards. I am  
looking for anyone with stories  or e=
xperiences from those that would be 
willing  to share them - as  well as a=
ny research and evidence you may have 
gathered from  them.  I am looking t=
o bring the folklore together with the 
history, science  and  experience.

Thanks.
