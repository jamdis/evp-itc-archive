I don't thin=
k the Puck and Ovilus work together.  They are separate
pieces with the sam=
e basic concepts, only different features.

I'm not sure of the exact mathe=
matical calculations on what it does
(have to look through older emails), b=
ut based off the result, it
assigns it a word from a list.  As always, I as=
sume there is a chance
that it could leave words out as nothing is complete=
 in the paranormal
world.  Again, don't quote me, Bill Chappal, who I belie=

would know much better than me.

One day I'll get enough money=

Thanks Bryan for repl=
ying
I was absolutely amazed when I saw that. 
Does the puck and the ovilus=
 work together? 
This is very interesting. How do you think it works as far=
 as
assigning a word according to the results from the sensors?
Could it le=
ave words out? Example: What if something said
Demon ( that was in Paranorm=
al State) and it was trying to
say Not Demon?

Hi Debbie,
   I thi=
nk the Ovilus is similar to the Paranormal Puck.  What it does
is take cons=
tant evironmental readings off the sensors inside it, does
some math on the=
m, then based off the result, assigns it to a word from
a list of words it =
knows.  That word is then output through a speakjet
microchip that you hear=
.
   I could be wrong though, but from my techie point of view...it's
prett=
y darn cool. :)
All the best,
Bryan

I=
 don't know how many of the members watch Paranormal State, but they
used
a=
 new piece of equipment called The Ovilus. You guys have got to check

am n=

where they came up with this. To me,=
 it sounds kind of like Frank's Box,

not the same.
Frank, please take a=

I don't understand how it works=
