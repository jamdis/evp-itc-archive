Your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; health is more important than=\r\n anything \n  here anyways, and you can&#39;t really &lt;BR&gt;&gt; do a job with inte=\r\nrpretation of \n  your results, much less your other &lt;BR&gt;&gt; responsibiliti=\r\nes in life, unless \n  you put your health first.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n--- On Fri, 7/9/10, \n  SnowfireL@aol. com &lt;SnowfireL@aol. com&gt; wrote:=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  From: SnowfireL@aol. com &lt;SnowfireL@aol. c=\r\nom&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] \n  Last nights files, [13 Attachments]&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; To: inside_the_box_ rtsc_ghost_ \n  box_research@ yahoogroups. com, &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, \n  RTSC@yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Fri=\r\nday, July 9, 2010, 7:26 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Well, got =\r\nno response out of the other list, let&#39;s \n  see if any of you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; folk=\r\ns on these lists can hear these at all. They \n  may be too fast, but I did =\r\ntry &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to slow them a bit, I know, these are \n  very hard to hear, go=\r\nt them last &lt;BR&gt;&gt; night in response to Steve&#39;s letter \n  about all the &quot;=\r\nreligious&quot; crap I&#39;ve &lt;BR&gt;&gt; been sending, such weird files I \n  sometimes=\r\n send in lately. I do not control &lt;BR&gt;&gt; what spirits say though, \n  afte=\r\nr all they are just people too. Got one on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; here that&#39;s really \n  f=\r\nunny, I think it has a little demon on it too, he seems &lt;BR&gt;&gt; very angry=\r\n, \n  and wants someone to &quot;Let me out! Let me out!&quot; is what he is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nsaying, \n  I think he is wanting to come after some folks, because, even &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; demon&#39;s \n  believe in God. He really sounds mad at some people and w=\r\nants &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &quot;.....out,&quot; just going to let you hear it, may need to pla=\r\ny it several times \n  to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; hear, but I think its kinda cute. I told =\r\nthem what some on the \n  lists were &lt;BR&gt;&gt; saying, and this was the respo=\r\nnse. btw Is someone going to \n  Florida ?
