It depends on how you present it to the children. My children are well awar=
e of my activities, though I don't allow them to partake (execpt for the bu=
ilding of the equipment). Then again, they haven't really shown any interes=
t except for asking if ghosts are bad or good. In that case I tell them the=
y are like people, some are bad and some are good. 

Some people believe in=
 shielding children from this stuff, I say it depends on the child. If you =
have a child who is easily scared or influenced, I would not expose them to=
 ITC. Being that my kids are more interested in the technology than the con=
tacts, I am not really worried about their mental health. Then again, my ch=
ildren have been raised with the understanding that these things are real, =
unseen things exist and what you feel and think concerning these things rea=
lly matter.

I was wo=
ndering if anyone had an opinion on the impact of performing
ITC experiment=
s or sessions, when there are young children around. Do
you think the child=
ren seeing their parents or others (in person, not
on TV) engaging in this =
activity would have an effect on the children,
and if so, do you think the =
effect would be positive, or negative?
