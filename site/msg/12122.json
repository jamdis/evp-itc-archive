That&#39;s great that you are working on an\n&gt; All-In-One. I would\n&gt; love\n&gt; &gt; to see it too. There is another All-In-One hand held\n&gt; by Digital\n&gt; Dowsing\n&gt; &gt; called an Ovilus and it has speakjet capabilities\n&gt; using allophones and\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; scaled-back dictionary, and EMF, digital dowsing rods,\n&gt; and more.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But I think it&#39;s great that you came up with a new\n&gt; idea!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; kristin\n&gt; &gt;"}
