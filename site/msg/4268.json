I have researched EVP since \n1999, \n&gt; and saw a youtube video from Mike Coletta and it really raised my \n&gt; attention level. I watch the videos, went to radio shack, bought \nthe \n&gt; equipment, and modified the 12-469. I recorded my first \ncommunication \n&gt; and I have to tell you that is has sparked a flame that has been \nout \n&gt; for many years now. I have read almost every article about Frank&#39;s \nbox \n&gt; and seen it in action at Waverly Hills with Chris Moon. Anywho I \nwould \n&gt; like to thank you guys for giving me a new investigation tool that \n&gt; gives realtime answers. Thanks also great job Mike with those vids \nand \n&gt; step by step direction on your site.\n&gt;"}
