<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Michael.  I have had the honor many times of either receiving messages for someone 
from their loved one and passing them on (to people I know) or in helping people learn to 
record for and receive their own messages.  Along with research in trying to improve 
communication with the other side, this is my primary work with EVP... helping others who 
are grieving make contact with their loved ones.  I do not charge for this.

I think to charge, or attempt to charge, anyone for a service (spiritual or otherwise) on the 
backend is slimy.  However, if there is an agreement in advance about fees and services, 
then that is up to the consenting parties.  People in all types of fields get paid for their 
time, regardless of the service being offered.  If the fee is clear, the service being offered 
legitimate, so be it.  As long as people aren&#x27;t being scammed.  grrrr...... I don&#x27;t like to see 
people taken advantage of in any field of service (as one crooked auto mechanic tried to 
do recently with my mother.)  Double grrrrrr........  
 
As for figuring out who a message belongs to?  I think we have to be very cautious in 
coming forward with content in recordings that were not requested by the living loved one 
of the person in spirit.  It&#x27;s sort of like the doctor&#x27;s creed to first do no harm.  I feel unless 
you know someone well enough to be fairly certain that your doing so would not 
traumatize them, you have to err on the side of caution and not say anything. 

For instance, there are some people who, due to their religious beliefs, could feel that you 
are being fooled by a demon or some other evil and that your saying you are in a touch 
with a loved one of theirs is not only not true, but cruel of you to claim so.  Even worse, 
would be those who actually do believe you have heard from their loved one, but take that 
to mean they are not in &#x27;Heaven&#x27; (as some believe those in Heaven do not have the ability 
to communicate here.)  There&#x27;s all kinds of beliefs which differ from our reality that our 
loved ones can be exactly where they are supposed to be, in a good place, and still talk to 
us via EVP.  We have to make sure that there is a similarity in world views.

In regard to mediumship:  Even as a experienced EVPer, and having made connections with 
my own loved ones, I still benefited from my sitting for an hour with a medium.  One of 
the really neat things is, I brought my recorders and upon playback, can actually hear EVP 
that relates to what the medium is saying.  So, as you wrote, that was icing on the cake.  
But the sitting alone, even without the EVP heard later, provided an explanation for events 
and a peace of mind to me about something I had carried with me for 25yrs and had not 
been able to resolve via EVP alone.  The fee for that sitting was some of the best money 
I&#x27;ve ever spent in my life, as what I got from it was priceless.

Personally, I&#x27;d like to see some joint studies done with mediums and EVP, each modality 
helping to validate the other in the process.   :-)

&gt; Amazing I take a weeks vacation and come back to 350 notes, and see this one.
&gt;    
&gt;   Both of your arguments are indeed accurate. 
&gt;    
&gt;   But it is an added bonus to the recipient or customer to hear their loved one&#x27;s voice on 
tape rather that by word of mouth from a gifted clairaudient, clairvoyant, psychic person. 
That is the icing on the cake.
&gt;    
&gt;   What would bother me terribly is if any of us researchers received a message from a 
spirit in which we could actually make contact with their loved one to send the tape, and 
then to try and charge the contactee for the recording.  
&gt;    
&gt;   In my opinion if any of us receive such a message with that clarity, we should 
send/give it to the contactee free of charge as doing so is in a sense a spiritual gift from 
the spirit to the contactee, and we are just the messenger.  I have been researching this 
concept, and I myself hope to one day be able to receive clear and concise messages which 
would enable me to contact the spirit&#x27;s loved one to give them that message should they 
wish to receive it. And I gurantee you it will be free of charge. 
&gt;    
&gt;   Have any of you received on any occasion enough info from the spirits to be able to 
contact the loved one and give them the recording?

&gt; 
&gt; There will always be a market for less educated people and some to 
&gt; take advantage of that. There is a a saying out there---- &quot;Stupid 
&gt; people don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re stupid&quot;. How true is that.

&gt; &gt; Margaret, I can&#x27;t argue with what you&#x27;ve said. I&#x27;m just saying 
&gt; there are those who take advantage and should have no business in 
&gt; doing so. One example I can give is Chris Moon. He charges people 
&gt; to do box sessions. I can&#x27;t remember the exact fee, but it&#x27;s 
&gt; outrageous that he&#x27;s doing this, not to mention, he does so with a 
&gt; Frank&#x27;s box. He is a self proclaimed medium and I&#x27;ve heard from many 
&gt; sources that he is nothing but a fake. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So I attribute my frustration with people of this type, but again I 
&gt; say, as long as there are people dumb enough to pay for this, then 
&gt; there will always be those who take advantage.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Personally, I feel anyone who is gifted with mediumship or other 
&gt; advanced intuitive abilities should use it as a gift to help others, 
&gt; not for monetary gain.. I&#x27;m not being judgmental here, that&#x27;s just 
&gt; how I feel. I have a friend who is also a legitimate medium and I 
&gt; don&#x27;t agree that she should use her abilities for gain, but it 
&gt; doesn&#x27;t mean I like her any less. My not liking it won&#x27;t change the 
&gt; fact that it happens, it&#x27;s just the way things go. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Do I think that Ron is taking advantage of people? No I don&#x27;t. 
&gt; Ron says he uses the best parts available and that the cost of the 
&gt; Minibox is very close to what it costs to manufacture it. How close, 
&gt; I have no idea. On the other hand, I don&#x27;t own one as I think $399 
&gt; or $449 for the &quot;crystal enhanced version,&quot; is a lot to pay for a 
&gt; device that, from what I&#x27;ve heard, produces the same results as a 
&gt; Radio Shack radio for $25-$40.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi Jeremy. If everyone knew about these support 
&gt; boards and that other resources are 
&gt; &gt; available to them, that would be one thing. Obviously everyone 
&gt; here is aware of that. But 
&gt; &gt; not everyone knows this place exists. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And even if they do know about the boards here, how many would have 
&gt; the nerve to ask 
&gt; &gt; for help from strangers? As Bruce recently shared, he gives people 
&gt; invitations to contact 
&gt; &gt; him privately in case they are too shy just ask a question 
&gt; publicly. Which means, by the 
&gt; &gt; way, to some degree they have overcome some of that shyness in 
&gt; order to post whatever it 
&gt; &gt; was to begin with, which inspired him to make this offer. What if 
&gt; they don&#x27;t even have the 
&gt; &gt; gumption to be anything more than be a look-i-loo?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m guessing many people are just surfing the net, checking out 
&gt; paranormal stuff, and run 
&gt; &gt; across the hacked boxes for sale. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Again, I ask people who are taking the position you and Bruce are 
&gt; regarding profits ... do 
&gt; &gt; you have this same harsh sentiment toward Ron Ricketts, who makes 
&gt; and sells the 
&gt; &gt; MiniBoxes? I realize he is passionate about this research and 
&gt; helping others. Does that 
&gt; &gt; give him amnesty for making a profit? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Personally I think we need to not be so judgmental. At what point 
&gt; does &quot;profitable gain in 
&gt; &gt; the paranormal field&quot; become &quot;sickening?&quot; I have a friend who is a 
&gt; medium. I mean THE 
&gt; &gt; REAL DEAL. He charges for his services. The fee is reasonable 
&gt; compared to many in his 
&gt; &gt; field. Does he do this because he&#x27;s a terrible person looking to 
&gt; take advantage of people? 
&gt; &gt; NO, he does so because he has been given a gift that changes 
&gt; people&#x27;s lives for the better. 
&gt; &gt; But he has to make a living.... has to support himself in some way. 
&gt; And because he has 
&gt; &gt; chosen to provide this service full time (and is not a trust fund 
&gt; baby), he makes a profit. 
&gt; &gt; This allows him to help far more people than he could if working 
&gt; some other kind of job 
&gt; &gt; and providing his services at no cost on the side. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I realize this is not exactly the same thing as gouging people on 
&gt; the price for a 
&gt; &gt; commercially available product, but making such blanket statements 
&gt; about profitability in 
&gt; &gt; the paranormal field being sickening is rather short-sighted, in my 
&gt; opinion. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have a southern friend who likes to say, &quot;It&#x27;s a mighty thin 
&gt; plank that ain&#x27;t got two sides.&quot; 
&gt; &gt; I just don&#x27;t think we have the right to claim that simply because 
&gt; someone is offering a 
&gt; &gt; good and or service for profit to consumers in the paranormal 
&gt; market, that this 
&gt; &gt; automatically means they are taking advantage of other&#x27;s 
&gt; vulnerabilities. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For Pete&#x27;s sake, no one is twisting the people&#x27;s arms to buy those 
&gt; units on eBay. They are 
&gt; &gt; perfectly free to buy from whatever source they choose. Since the 
&gt; units do work as 
&gt; &gt; claimed, we can argue that people have overpaid, shopped unwisely, 
&gt; or whatever. I assure 
&gt; &gt; you this happens every single day throughout the retail market 
&gt; place with all types of 
&gt; &gt; products and services. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I will say I have a fairly heathy dose of distain for 
&gt; charlatans/scam artists (of any flavor in 
&gt; &gt; any field) but that is not what we are talking about here. We are 
&gt; talking about people who 
&gt; &gt; are offering legitimate products to consumers. I&#x27;d rather see 
&gt; people doing this for profit, 
&gt; &gt; even when obscene, than running scams that damage people&#x27;s 
&gt; physical, mental, and/or 
&gt; &gt; financial well-being.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Very well put, Bruce. Profitable gain in the paranormal field is

&gt; &gt; there are those who continue to support the ones profiting, so it 
&gt; will continue. It makes 
&gt; &gt; me sick that people take advantage of others vulnerabilities,

&gt; &gt; spiritual matters, but that&#x27;s a rant for another time and place.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Do not give in to these demons that are trying to make a buck 
&gt; from the research we love 
&gt; &gt; and the equipment we use.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have given away including the shipping 5 RS boxes for free, 4, 
&gt; 470&#x27;s and 1 469 all 
&gt; &gt; hacked by me.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I did not do it to gain popularity or even wanted a thank you. my 
&gt; sole motivation was to 
&gt; &gt; bring new people into the research and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; in turn change someones life and perpetuate the idea of strength 
&gt; in numbers, in this 
&gt; &gt; case strength of communication.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; To all new people on this board, do not patronise these wolves 
&gt; that prey on the needs 
&gt; &gt; and wants of others. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The RS 20 -125 is everything the 470 &amp; 469 are and a little more. 
&gt; do not let the size or 
&gt; &gt; complicated button arrangement scare you off.
&gt; &gt; &gt; the hack is as simple as the others. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do not buy any RS hacks from ebay, they are sold with the wrong 
&gt; energy attached to 
&gt; &gt; them, spirit wise.
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is why I and all other researchers should follow the example 
&gt; of a great man to 
&gt; &gt; whom we owe all of this research.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mr. Frank Sumption, who was in a position at one time to make a 
&gt; substantial amount of 
&gt; &gt; money from his boxes and
&gt; &gt; &gt; was offered the opportunity on a silver platter. But chose to 
&gt; follow what had been asked 
&gt; &gt; of him by higher entities.
&gt; &gt; &gt; And that was to keep the research pure for research sake. And 
&gt; that at no time was this 
&gt; &gt; equipment or knowledge there of
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be for monetary gain.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I adhere to this promise made by Frank to our friends on the 
&gt; other side and feel that 
&gt; &gt; there is no need to give in to these box 
&gt; &gt; &gt; extortionists. . If a box is not attainable for a new person yet, 
&gt; the right way. Then it 
&gt; &gt; probably is not their time yet.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have coined a phrase and believe in it. &quot;The researcher does 
&gt; not choose the box, the 
&gt; &gt; box chooses the researcher&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Be patient, those that do not yet have a box. We will do all we 
&gt; can to help you obtain 
&gt; &gt; one.
