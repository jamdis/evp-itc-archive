Box #22 is Rosemary&#39;s \nand we had an &quot;imprinting&quot; session so she could be introduced as a \nnew Box operator. Otherwise that call for Frank repeatedly it seems.\n-Bill\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Well I got a voice from #22 that says &quot;Where&#39;s that Bill-------He \ndoesn&#39;t \n&gt; Live here&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Question for all &quot;Frank&#39;s ghostbox&quot; owners\n&gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 6 Jul 2007 20:44:42 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Bill said something that had me thinking. He mentioned that when \nhe first \n&gt; &gt;got his box it called Franks name repeatedly. That isnt the first \ntime I \n&gt; &gt;saw someone say that. I know quite a few of you now have been \ngiven a box \n&gt; &gt;or even constructed your own versions like Steve based on the work \nFrank \n&gt; &gt;did.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   I have heard a couple of peoples results here but I would like \nto hear \n&gt; &gt;more so I am going to ask if you have one you comment on your use \nof it and \n&gt; &gt;how you think the results went as well as maybe post a few sound \nfiles that \n&gt; &gt;I can hear. I have spent years listening to the box voices but its \n&gt; &gt;refreshing to hear others results and see the variations as with \nany other \n&gt; &gt;evp method, it differs by user/location. LOL you know who you are \nand I \n&gt; &gt;wont name you all but I do hope you will share with us.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Thanks!\n&gt; &gt;   Misty\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;Be a better Heartthrob.
