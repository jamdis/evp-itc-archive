That will take away the clicking and also give you an adjustable sweep rate.\n&gt; \n&gt; You basically just make a simple function generator that will give you a linear triangle wave.  It will connect to the 469 board to the &quot;vt&quot; pin, which is clearly marked.\n&gt; \n&gt; The function generator kit can be bought here for $10\n&gt; \n&gt; http://store.qkits.com/moreinfo.cfm/QK23\n&gt; \n&gt; For an extra $5 they build it for you.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;"}
