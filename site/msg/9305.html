Zach--so this software would make a layout in a format you could use? I'm =
thinking two differnt boards, one sweep/amp only, and another with a tuner.=
 I only have 8 LA1135 radio chips on hand, but it would be nice to get thos=
e into boxes. 
 
 Last fall I had four boards made for the LA1816, and it t=
urned out I couldn't get the FM side to work, and the AM was extremely nois=
y--so wasted I think it was $90 per pair. All SMT except the radio chip.
