I think Dave is just incorporating the sweep method into his design pretty much the same way you are incorporating the new updates to your box design. Either way the sweep method works well and is a simple process even the least technical person (me) can use. Not many people would attempt to build a box or build an optical mic but they can use a radio.
   
  So thanks for the new technique guys and I cant wait to see more results from your designs which are both progressing quite well.

going on during it's use. Change of state from liquid to vapor to 
heat and light, IR radiation, thermal noise and some processes I am 
missing or unaware of. The radio sweep is used as a source of sound 
samples, the microphone also works well using music or plain speech. 
The limited high frequency response also seems to act as a built-in 
bandpass filter. I'm not using anything complicated or out of the 
reach of a Wal-Mart or K-Mart shopper. I'm using an off the shelf 
oil lamp with a 3/4 inch wide flat wick, a phototransistor from 
Radio Shack and an FM radio. There is more to the flame microphone 
then modulated light, I can modulate the DC feeding a flashlight or 
and LED and not get the same results. Here is an exchange using the 
optical microphone and FM radio sweep, my voice is reduced by 10db.
