Bruce, thank you so much for the vote of confidence, it really means a lot to me.  I had the privilege of speaking with Jeff yesterday, and discovered that he too is from Chicago.  He suggested Cool Edit Pro instead of the adobe given it is much easier to slow down the clip  without distorting the original voice imprint. 
   
  In addition we discussed how the questions and answers that I was receiving in some cases where not as direct as they should be, but the lines of two-way communication continued to flow with many entities coming through at the same time chiming in with their own answers wanting to be heard.  I have several clips that mention all of you by name and would like to forward them under separate cover if I may.  
   
  I thank you all for your help and will continue uploading my data with trail and error as it comes, in the hopes that some of my contributions will count and help you all with your future research.
   
  Juli

          Juli,

you are well on your way to becoming a fine and valuable researcher.

As a new researcher just having the guts to post your results for 
critique is proof enough that you have what it takes. Stick with it 
and if I can help in any way please don't hesitate to call on me.

That's what we are here for to help one another, every new researcher 
that has success and sticks with it helps to solidify the strength of 
communication for our friends on the other side by adding good 
vibration and positivity to the circle.

I have been told by my guides that this is our ultimate goal to spread 
the word and educate as many new researchers as possible.

keep doing what you are doing and our friends will hold your hand 
through the journey.

Bruce
