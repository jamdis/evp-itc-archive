When you email a \n=\r\nfile, if it is not saved as a compressed format, the email filtering proces=\r\ns \nwill actually compress the file automatically.\n=A0\nSo even if you have a=\r\nttached a wav. file, it \nwill loose resolution over the email process. It w=\r\nill not sound exactly the same \nas the original wav. file. How much it diff=\r\ners depends on the size of the file \nyou are attaching. If it is a very=A0l=\r\narge file, it will sound much \ndifferent.\n=A0\nThe only exception to this is=\r\n if the wav. \nfile is small enough that the filtering process will ignore i=\r\nt. It has to be \npretty small though, like under 1=A0MB (I am not exactly s=\r\nure of the \nthreshold).\n=A0\nThe best way to share files over the \ninternet=\r\n=A0if you want them as close to the original as possible is to upload \nthem=\r\n directly to a website.\n=A0\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: \n  Rj =\r\n\n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com \n  Sent: Sunday, May 10, 2009 10:54 AM\n  Su=\r\nbject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading \n  rules\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n=\r\nPixelization doesn&#39;t clean-up the data: it replaces \n        it.=A0 Imagine=\r\n taking a picture of a field of flowers, and beginning \n        to add leve=\r\nls or pixelization to the picture.=A0 Soon, you would not \n        be able =\r\nto tell there were flowers there at all.=A0 You would see a \n        lot of=\r\n colored blocks.\n\nOr in the other direction, imagine you are \n        looki=\r\nng at a competely randomize bunch of pixes on your screen: a \n        compl=\r\nete screen of truely random static snow.=A0 Pixelizing this, \n        after=\r\n a while, you would again start to see colored \n        blocks.\n\nWhat&#39;s hap=\r\npening is that it is processing an area of the \n        image, taking (for =\r\ninstance) the average value of that entire area, and \n        replacing all=\r\n the blocks in that area with the average.=A0 In video \n        processing,=\r\n this would result in a field of multi-colored flowers being \n        repla=\r\nced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish block, with no \n        resembla=\r\nnce to flowers.=A0 In the noise example, it maybe replace all \n        the =\r\nrandom pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.=A0 If you \n        did=\r\n not know beforehand what the original picture was, you couldn&#39;t tell \n    =\r\n    whether your pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a chevy, th=\r\ne \n        sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.\n\nIt works the same=\r\n \n        with the sound files.=A0 Taking something as complex as speech, a=\r\nnd \n        replacing frequencies with their averages, loses the speech the=\r\n farther \n        you go, until you head strange fluctuating square waves.=\r\n=A0 Doing the \n        same to random static will eventually produce the sa=\r\nme thing.=A0 And \n        random fluctuating square waves can sound a bit l=\r\nike speech - or at \n        least, you could have fun sharing with each oth=\r\ner what you thing they \n        &#39;sound like&#39;.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- On Sun, 5/10/09, Mis=\r\nty Dawn \n        &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n        \nFrom: \n         =\r\n Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt;\nSubject: Re: \n          [EVP-ITC] File=\r\n uploading rules\nTo: \n          EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\nDate: Sunday, May =\r\n10, 2009, 9:29 \n          AM\n\n\n          \n          \n          \n          \n=\r\n            \n            \n              \n                I always save the =\r\nwhole file in wav format then do my clips \n                as mp3.

Imagine tak=\r\ning a picture of a field of flowers, and beginning \n        to add levels o=\r\nr pixelization to the picture.&nbsp; Soon, you would not \n        be able t=\r\no tell there were flowers there at all.&nbsp; You would see a \n        lot =\r\nof colored blocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or in the other direction, imagine you are \n     =\r\n   looking at a competely randomize bunch of pixes on your screen: a \n     =\r\n   complete screen of truely random static snow.&nbsp; Pixelizing this, \n  =\r\n      after a while, you would again start to see colored \n        blocks.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;What&#39;s happening is that it is processing an area of the \n        im=\r\nage, taking (for instance) the average value of that entire area, and \n    =\r\n    replacing all the blocks in that area with the average.&nbsp; In video =\r\n\n        processing, this would result in a field of multi-colored flowers =\r\nbeing \n        replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish block, with =\r\nno \n        resemblance to flowers.&nbsp; In the noise example, it maybe re=\r\nplace all \n        the random pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.=\r\n&nbsp; If you \n        did not know beforehand what the original picture wa=\r\ns, you couldn&#39;t tell \n        whether your pixelized image was really a fie=\r\nld of flowers, a chevy, the \n        sky with clouds, or a random bunch of =\r\npixels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It works the same \n        with the sound files.&nbsp; Takin=\r\ng something as complex as speech, and \n        replacing frequencies with t=\r\nheir averages, loses the speech the farther \n        you go, until you head=\r\n strange fluctuating square waves.&nbsp; Doing the \n        same to random =\r\nstatic will eventually produce the same thing.&nbsp; And \n        random fl=\r\nuctuating square waves can sound a bit like speech - or at \n        least, =\r\nyou could have fun sharing with each other what you thing they \n        &#39;so=\r\nund like&#39;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Sun, 5/10/09, Misty Dawn \n     =\r\n   &lt;i&gt;&lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
