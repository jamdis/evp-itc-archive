Yes Bruce, "We want to kill you" is word for word what I hear.  Thank you f=
or being the first person ever to validate this for me, because now I know =
it's REAL, I'm not crazy, and it isn't my imagination.  This was captured o=
n a digital voice recorder while I was heating coffee in the microwave oven=
 nearby, and I felt that the microwave must have been a powerful energy sou=
rce for the "speaker."  It may be important to note that I had just invited=
 spirits inside the house from outside, and that after I listened to this m=
essage I told them to go back outside because they were too rude to continu=
e talking to.  I've tried to replicate this experiment a number of times si=
nce then (without the verbal invitation into my home) and have had no luck =
whatsoever.  

Gleefully moving on to box research!

Robin

  Robin,
   
  In the evp file you posted I be=
lieve I'm hearing "we want to kill you"
  please let me know if that is wha=
t you hear.
   
  Robin, I am glad to hear that the protection ritual will =
be utilized by you 
  in the purpose it was intended. To give any individua=
l that wants to an
  opportunity to use it.
   
  You will find many forms =
of interaction on this group, running the gamut from total agreement 
  to =
calm debate /discussion. To full blown arguments. 
   
  That is what makes=
 a group, If everyone followed one single ideology and the ideas of any sin=
gle person without question
  it would not be a group it would be a cult.
 =
  
  Welcome to the wonderful world of box research robin, I'm sure you wil=
l be a valued member and researcher in this community.
   
  Bruce

    I'm still=
 giving this topic a lot of thought because I absolutely believe in the pow=

st started recording EVP a couple of years ago I was warned to expect negat=
ive responses, so when it happened to me I felt elated rather than frighten=
ed or distressed.  I will ask again:  What physical or psychic harm is a di=
sembodied entity capable of doing?  Please listen to the one EVP I've poste=

r, and I consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is the response that=
 has created the determination in me to continue researching the unknown.  =


    Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings.  I only want to learn as much =
as I can from you and the other dedicated researchers on this board.  It ne=
ver occurred to me to use a protection ritual in the past, and that's about=
 all I can say.  I will probably use one from this point on, maybe not so m=
uch to repel evil as to attract goodness.  

    So, thank you for this con=
tribution.  I think the debate has been an excellent one, and I've apprecia=
ted the opportunity to be enlightened.

damned protection debate


      I swore I would not get wraped up in this =
debate

      BUT!

      The reason I came up with this whole protection r=
itual was that some 
      of the new researchers where

      expressing a=
 rational concern for negative responces that they were 
      recieving th=
rough thier boxes.

      The short protection ritual that I posted is not =
meant to quell 
      irrational histerical fear, and I agree

      with r=
osemary that anyone suffering from such fear should rethink 
      thier in=
volment in the paranormal research field.

      that being said, It was on=
ly meant as a source of subliminal comfort 
      to those new individuals =
that had never 

      expperienced spiritual negativity. And to help ease =
them into 
      aproaching a session eventually with confidence

      and=
 determination as well as full curiousity for all types of the 
      commu=
nication we recieve.

      My initial post of the ritual file was done wit=
h the best of 
      intentions and meant to be another tool available for =
those who felt 

      they needed or wanted to employ it. it is a simple i=
nnocent prayer 
      ritual, I don't think it is really worthy of all this=
 debate.

      Use it, don't use it. It's there if you want it. Also I mus=
t say 
      there are two kinds of fear the kind that is natural and a god=
 

      given emotion for self preservation, ie the fright and flight refl=
ex 
      that is an instinctive trait in all of us. Then you have the 

  =
    irrational dibilitating phobic fear that can turn an individual into 
 =
     a frozen statue. That type of fear I believe is unhealthy

      and s=
hould be addressed and dealt with and learned how to harness. I 
      also=
 believe that anyone that harbors that type of fear 

      would not be dr=
awn to the paranormal anyway and in a case of such 
      fear it would alr=
eady be present and doing a small protection 

      ritual would not fuel =
it any further. So lets take it for what it is, 
      something to utilize=
 in our box of tools like an emf meter.

      you may have an old rusty od=
d sized wrench at the bottom of your tool 
      box at home that you inher=
ited from your grandfather and have never 
      used

      but if you com=
e across that odd nut that needs tightening somedsy you 
      will be glad=
 you have it.
