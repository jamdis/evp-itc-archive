<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Juli,

Question one i believe it all depends on your radio signal at the 
time it was recorded, weather can affect transmission on both 
sides.  Also, it depends if the audio was an outright message or if 
it was put through several programs on the computer to dig it out.  
At that point it could have been nothing turned into something with 
the software out there today.  Second question, i&#x27;m not really sure 
what you mean but i have gotten additional Evp&#x27;s on the recording 
afterwards that did not come out of the box at the time and i didn&#x27;t 
hear it.  White noise does attract them.  Your third question is a 
good one, i used to get into arguments all the time until i figured 
out it was the dark heads coming through trying to get you upset in 
some way.  If you learn to block them out, it helps communication.  
If you don&#x27;t, they win and you don&#x27;t get any good research in.

&gt; I have several questions for those who currently have devices.  I 
am 
&gt; hoping you can answer.
&gt; 
&gt;      When listening to some of the messages you currently have 
posted 
&gt; like the message regarding Tesla, why is it that some come thru so 
&gt; very clear and audiable to understand vs. others?  Most of mine 
audio 
&gt; I have gotten from the boxes are very clear to hear outright.
&gt; 
&gt;       Second question?  In those who have tested it at a proposed 
&gt; location, have they ever gotten addition evp relating to the 
messages 
&gt; coming over the box?  The reason I asked is because I have.  When 
&gt; video taping the box being used, I got a warning of sorts prior to 
&gt; the message from the box.  Has anyone else experienced this?
&gt; 
&gt;       Third, has anyone ever gotten into a heated debate with 
someone 
&gt; over the box. A two way conversation that had the potential of 
&gt; getting nasty?  Or things that came across that were not nice?
&gt; 
&gt; I would love to know if anyone has experienced any of this events.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Juli
