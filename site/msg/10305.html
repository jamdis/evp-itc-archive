<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Deleting my files took it down about 3 percent, I noticed.

Yes, I have been sick and I&#x27;m plain worn down to a nub with all this
fighting.

I do appreciate you asking after me, Misty. 

I&#x27;ll be around.

Ann

&gt; Thanks Ann. I think going to more compacted files will help us all in 
&gt; the long run. We are already back to 72% rather than 96% tho most of 
&gt; the file space was being used by someone else besides you =)
&gt; 
&gt; I know it gets to be a bit testy around here and the other forums. I 
&gt; also know that some of the nastiness can tear apart good working 
&gt; relationships as well as friendships. I was just askin Frank if he 
&gt; knew if you were still sick or not because you had been very quiet 
&gt; lately.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree sometimes its good to take a step back rather than get 
&gt; yourself caught up in the drama fests going on around us all. Thats 
&gt; on and off the board as well. 
&gt; 
&gt; As I said I know some of what goes on off of this forum, and I am sad 
&gt; to see most of it happening. I just hope everyone can regain focus 
&gt; and like you said, remember why we are here.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you feel better soon, and rejoin us when the stress level is 
&gt; passed. And I hope it passes soon so ya can run some test sessions 
&gt; with the new tool that arrived!
&gt; 
&gt; I keep telling people that all the negativity does take a toll, on us 
&gt; personally and our working together.

&gt; &gt; Get a grip--all of you.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m out of here until all this petty BS and hatred sorts out. The  
&gt; &gt; amount of stress that I&#x27;ve been through with all this fighting 
&gt; since  
&gt; &gt; early this year has really taken a toll on me as a person and a  
&gt; &gt; researcher. I&#x27;m going off line for awhile. If anyone wants to talk 
&gt; to  
&gt; &gt; me, send me a private e-mail because I&#x27;m going to read only/no e-
&gt; mail  
&gt; &gt; until I remember again why I used to wake up every day and want to  
&gt; &gt; run to my computer to see what would be posted.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Misty--as per your request, I&#x27;ve deleted my files.
