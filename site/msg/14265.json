My mistake on first time upload as they were in the longer .wav format (sounded best though...that&#39;s why was my original) They were DELETED. I should have read sticky ;)I hope these are helpful for others to hear what is out there. Very few have been enhanced (Audacity) so headphones are a MUST. You can find the EVP&#39;s in file name: Jim&#39;s RR-DR6o EVP&#39;s    ENJOY :)"}
