      Experiment 2
=



On Friday, 7/16/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer monitor, r=
ight in front of me, and will leave it there until noon Denver time on Mond=
ay, 7/19/2010.   This experiment asks for participants to determine what th=
at object is. Vague or partial answers won't be counted (for example, just =
giving a color, shape, size,  what it's made of, etc): we're looking for wh=
at it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Monday won't count.  Participan=
ts can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means they chose.=
  At the end of the experiment, I will reveal the object, and a tally of th=
e number of correct and/or incorrect answers.




In order to keep me hones=
t, I have taken a picture of the object at the start of the experiment and =
loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group.  The idea with th=
is file is that you can download it now and 'keep it safe' on your computer=
. Then at the end of the experiment, I will post the password so you can re=
veal the contents of the file. That way, you were in control of the origina=
l image during the entire test, not me. If you can follow the link, it is h=
ere:

/ RJ/RJ20100716. win.zip



Mac users: http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group=
/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ20100716. mac.zip



And if you do not care to downlo=
ad the zip file now, I will post the final image there at the end of the ex=
periment anyway.



My monitor is one of the older box-like SONY CRTs, and =
says "Trinitron" and  "Multiscan 200sf" on the upper front.   I have a coup=
le monitors stacked in my closet too: they are not the monitors used in thi=
s experiment (and have nothing else on them anyway), and I have several lap=
tops around: they are also not the monitors in this experiment.  The monito=
r in this experiment is the only SONY monitor I have, says "SONY in various=

 when the correct answer would have been "radio":

Please post all an=
swers to the group thread: that way, there will be a public record and I wo=
n't get accused of losing any answers. 



And best of luck to all the part=
