It&#39;s not set up \n&gt; for &quot;hack \n&gt; &gt; mode&quot;, and it uses only the AA-8 packs as power. I attempted top \n&gt; put a \n&gt; &gt; video on You Tube , but ran into some problems, and I had to get \nto \n&gt; &gt; work, so don&#39;t know if that uploaded. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Frank\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n_________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Get Free (PRODUCT) RED  Emoticons, Winks and Display Pics.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://joinred.spaces.live.com?\n&gt; ocid=TXT_HMTG_prodredemoticons_052008\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
