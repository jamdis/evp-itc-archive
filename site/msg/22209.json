But I did make a couple boxes with tone generators to mix a\ntone in with the tuner auido. The idea being to provide a foundation tone\nwhich might help &quot;them&quot; make their voices. It seems to help, but I don&#39;t\nkeep the boxes long enough to really test it.\n\n Spiricom used 13 tones, supposedly the 13 fundamental frequencies that\nmake up human speech.  I used a square wave tone generator, vary simple,\nand rich in harmics, so hoping  mutiple tones generators not needed. One\nbox was $4, the next one was 111, I think. I had a couple with 8 tones, but\nwas too cumbersom.\n\nF-S\n\nOn Tue, Nov 22, 2011 at 10:43 AM, Peter James Haviland ACCH &lt;\ndocstrangeone@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anyone tried to build and use the spiricom device?\n&gt;\n&gt; Pete\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\nToo cumbe som!
