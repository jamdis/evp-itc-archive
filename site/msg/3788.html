<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, I read about even using a metronome in Spiricom. I still want 
to get a cheap electronic one to test it. However, MiniBox first!

Thanks,

&gt;             I appreciate the advice, Frank. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ll do so, at least initially. Perhaps it&#x27;s so some sort of lock-
on 
&gt; 
&gt; with those on the otherside can be established. From my ITC 
reading, 
&gt; 
&gt; there is something of a challange to ITC due to unsynchronized 
&gt; 
&gt; difference of time and space between hither and yon. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps leaving a Box on and running in one location improves the 
&gt; 
&gt; chances by allow those using their tech on the otherside to 
establish 
&gt; 
&gt; a better connection.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For some silly reason I was just reminded of a scene from an old 
&gt; 
&gt; classic, The Time Tunnel. I visualized again those white coated 
&gt; 
&gt; scientists in the control room, using the big machine to scan 
across 
&gt; 
&gt; the vastness, trying to get a stable lock on Doug and Tony... lost 
in 
&gt; 
&gt; time!

&gt; &gt;  My only advice, use it from the same location, at least for a 
&gt; 
&gt; couple days. There seesm to be something they cannect to it. My 
&gt; 
&gt; version of the nMini box wasn&#x27;t working well froa a couple days, 
then 
&gt; 
&gt; al the suddenn started working. the radio was scanning, and the 
&gt; 
&gt; electronics was working, just the &quot;voices&quot; were weak.

&gt; &gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  but...what do I know?

a

&gt; &lt;babiarz3@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Lance, &gt; I think you make my point very well. 
&gt; 
&gt; You say you don&#x27;t know Chris&gt; personally but that it seems I am the 
&gt; 
&gt; one wearing rose colored&gt; glasses. I do know Chris. Even when Frank 
&gt; 
&gt; is upset he says &quot;Chris is a&gt; nice guy&quot;. Chris&#x27; statements and 
&gt; 
&gt; beliefs have never changed while&gt; others can be wishy washy 
depending 
&gt; 
&gt; on the day. The view that Chris&gt; does not want any one to research 
&gt; 
&gt; the box besides him is BS. The fact&gt; is that prior to Franks 
original 
&gt; 
&gt; yahoo group disappearing, Chris&gt; provided a link directly to the 
&gt; 
&gt; schematics. In his presentations he&gt; would tell people that the 
&gt; 
&gt; schematics were available online. Yet,&gt; because he is against mass 
&gt; 
&gt; production, it MUST be because he wants the&gt; research all to 
himself. 
&gt; 
&gt; Rose colored glasses or a case of only seeing&gt; what is wanted? This 
&gt; 
&gt; is a fact compared to perceptions and opinions. &gt; &gt; Fact: Almost 
each 
&gt; 
&gt; and every user of a box or it&#x27;s facsimile have&gt; stated that lower 
&gt; 
&gt; energy/evil/ dark... entities have spoken via the&gt; device. &gt; &gt; 
Fact: 
&gt; 
&gt; Rick Moran states that the groups for testing will include&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; believers, skeptics, senior citizens, (now here&#x27;s where it gets 
scary)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; CHILDREN and HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS!&gt; &gt; - Couple the last two facts 
&gt; 
&gt; together and do the math. One mentally&gt; unstable child or youth 
hears 
&gt; 
&gt; the box tell him it is right to kill or&gt; rape or .....&gt; &gt; Fact: 
Rick 
&gt; 
&gt; Moran in his article about Tools being only as good as the&gt; users 
&gt; 
&gt; states, &quot;...know how they work before you go into the field.&quot; &gt; So, 
&gt; 
&gt; in one place we are still testing, in another we are sending them&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; out in the field to be tested by groups that include children and 
&gt; 
&gt; high&gt; school students. The good thing is that a nice little online 
&gt; 
&gt; tutorial&gt; is available with some warnings. Phew! As long as this 
&gt; 
&gt; can&#x27;t come back&gt; on anyone I guess all the bases are covered 
(tongue 
&gt; 
&gt; in cheek). &gt; &gt; Fact: Chris has been the primary tester of the 
device 
&gt; 
&gt; in the field.&gt; That fact deserves consideration, at the very least. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Fact: Last night, a radio personality on Spooky South Coast 
&gt; 
&gt; claimed&gt; that after he engaged the dark voices coming through the 
&gt; 
&gt; box, he was&gt; physically attacked.&gt; &gt; Fact: Frank has stated that in 
&gt; 
&gt; the beginning Chris was the only one&gt; who understood how the box 
&gt; 
&gt; should be used.&gt; &gt; Fact: Some people who have received boxes from 
&gt; 
&gt; Frank discovered they&gt; were not able to use them although they 
worked 
&gt; 
&gt; fine for Frank. These&gt; same people would not return the boxes to be 
&gt; 
&gt; looked at.&gt; &gt; Fact: After death communications have been received 
via 
&gt; 
&gt; both computers&gt; and phones. If it were simply the devices and not 
the 
&gt; 
&gt; users would we&gt; not have millions of these communications? &gt; &gt; 
Fact: 
&gt; 
&gt; Mark Macy states that in an after death communication&gt; 
communication 
&gt; 
&gt; with Konstanin Raudive in which Mark asks &quot; Can you tell&gt; me about 
&gt; 
&gt; the equipment you use to produce a perfect, almost perfect&gt; voice 
on 
&gt; 
&gt; earth?&quot; Konstanin replies &quot;Well it depends on your reception-&gt; or 
&gt; 
&gt; mainly your psychic reception.&quot; This fact backs up the theory that&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; effective users are limited.&gt; &gt; Fact: In another after death 
&gt; 
&gt; communication Konstanin addresses contact&gt; fields saying &quot;...but if 
&gt; 
&gt; there is dissonance in the form of fears,&gt; doubts, and animosities 
&gt; 
&gt; the contact field becomes cloudy...that&#x27; s when&gt; negative spirit 
&gt; 
&gt; groups close to earth in vibration can break into&gt; existing bridges 
&gt; 
&gt; with troubling results.&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; And so yes, maybe I wear rose colored 
&gt; 
&gt; glasses. However, I am inclined&gt; to believe that I have done my 
&gt; 
&gt; research and have availed myself of&gt; quite a bit of information 
&gt; 
&gt; regarding this topic. &gt; &gt; With that said, I am holding an online 
&gt; 
&gt; event where people can ask&gt; Chris the questions they want as long 
as 
&gt; 
&gt; they are formed in an&gt; intelligent manner. If you are interested in 
&gt; 
&gt; attending the event you&gt; can find the information on the front page 
&gt; 
&gt; of my site at&gt; www.thepsinetwork. com I felt it unnecessary to 
attempt 
&gt; 
&gt; to &quot;bridge the&gt; gap&quot; as well between speculation, insinuation and 
&gt; 
&gt; fact. &gt; &gt; Sincerely,&gt; Babs&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-

&gt; Bab,&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even though I&#x27;ve newly begun to chime in here, it seems

&gt; to me that &gt; &gt; some people are guilty of wearing rose colored

&gt; 
&gt; personally, so I really &gt; &gt; don&#x27;t know what really motivates him. 
&gt; 
&gt; Right or wrong, by conducting &gt; &gt; himself in the manner he has, 
it&#x27;s
