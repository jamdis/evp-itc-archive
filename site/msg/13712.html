&gt;   I think it is always ok to propose a theory that some instance like this
&gt; might be a real giant head, floating in thje sky.  But then, you have to ask
&gt; stuff like, ok, are there better or easier or more realistic explanations of
&gt; what this could be?  In this case, since we know clouds can form shapes that
&gt; look like other things, and since we know we can see shapes in clouds that
&gt; aren&#x27;t there, and since as far as we know there are very few giant floating
&gt; heads in the sky, then in this case, I agree, that the most intelligent
&gt; course is to overide the giant head theory and replace it with an &quot;I&#x27;m
&gt; experiencing pareidolia &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia&gt;&quot;
&gt; theory.  And let that one hold, until some more compelling evidence proposes
&gt; perhaps a different theory.
