Not sure about an MP3 player on my computer but I have MS Media Center and Windows Media Player to handle music etc.  Don't know much more about how to handle your MP3 files.  I suppose your apple is more sophisticated.  If others are opening your file I would think I should be able to also.  
   
  I just checked another member's file and I was able to open and listen to her MP3 file.  So something else is up with you and me.  Also, you had sent me a file via personal email and I am able to open and listen to it.  Will keep trying.   Ron L
