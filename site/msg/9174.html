<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi guys
I know you are all up in arms about this EBAY seller.
I&#x27;d like to say something from the view from someone new to this 
interest.
I for one have been desperate for answers.  I lost my mom almost a 
year ago and have been searching desperately for an answer (do we go 
somewhere ? can we still talk to each other somehow ?) This goes on 
to a point most of you would think is pathetic.
I have contacted many of you offline for help, to purchase or just to 
ask for help on making a device myself with limited electronic 
knowledge.  All of you have been helpful or at least responded to an 
email.  So, I went with one suggestion, I hacked a  20-125.  I have 
to say, I am quite disappointed.  I have tried whole heartedly to sit 
and listen and wait in many sessions as you call them.  If anyone 
could get the thing to work out of pure desperation, it is myself !!!
of course my main goal was to reach my mother, but at this point any 
spirit would do, just to hear something in response to my questions.  
I had nothing in return.
I have a good ear to listen for any response, it is not as simple as  
not hearing properly.  In fact I seem to have capture one voice with 
my recorder alone in the beginning, but nothing since.
There is a frustration in reading posts from most those that seem to 
continuously build these things that can work and actually 
communicate.

To be honest, I think this person is taking a great leap and a great 
risk in offering these devices out to the public.  If people purchase 
them with great hopes like myself of speaking to a deceased loved one 
and nothing comes through.  This guys reputation in mush on EBAY.
I for one am at a frustration point ready to give up. I tried to be a 
part of all of you, with something to contribute, a voice , a 
response or something.  I almost feel like crying.
The only weird thing is the radio will turn itself on.  I have pulled 
the batteries out of it because it&#x27;s annoying. A good 40.00 gone to 
nothing in such desperation !!! If someone wants to test this box or 
to see if it works I&#x27;d appreciate it.
