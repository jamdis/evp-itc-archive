I just wanted to say hello to everyone in the group, and introduce myself. I have been active in paranormal investigation for some time. I was hoping to find someone to help me with building existing products (labor and cost paid by me) for paranormal investigation. I was sent in this direction by Mike Coletta who spoke highly of the skills and kindness of the members of this group. I look forward to hearing from some of those tech-savvy individuals that I envy! =) Thanks in advance, Robb Demarest\n&gt;"}
