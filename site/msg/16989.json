Could it be that you own mind has access to levels you are not\n&gt;&gt; aware of, perhaps spiritual contacts, or higher levels of being?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  I think it&#39;s a bit of everything, there is external contact, and there is\n&gt;&gt; some of just the mind talking to itself through these methods. I have always\n&gt;&gt; said you have to be careful that you don&#39;t create the evidence you are\n&gt;&gt; looking for, but I am conveniently ignored.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  F-S\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Tue, Apr 20, 2010 at 9:26 AM, John S &lt;phenom_investigator@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  As has been said, one of  the most likely explanations for the Ouija is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the working of the mind.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; What is somewhat at issue, as is so often the case when discussing\n&gt;&gt;&gt; apparent discarnate\n&gt;&gt;&gt; communications, is the actual source of the apparent intelligence.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Micromuscular reactions do indeed appear to be one source of the Ouija\n&gt;&gt;&gt; when operators are\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in contact with the planchette. But this is only one category of Ouija\n&gt;&gt;&gt; interactions. There is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; another completely different category where no operator is touching the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; board or the planchette,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and yet it moves and remains in motion, often changing directions or\n&gt;&gt;&gt; flying off the board. This\n&gt;&gt;&gt; type of activity is more akin to psychokinesis, the mind affecting the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; environment.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Both types of activity could be mediated in the mind of a living\n&gt;&gt;&gt; operator, and in fact modern\n&gt;&gt;&gt; parapsychology research suggest this is the most reasonable explanation.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; But again the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; source of the information thus presented is at question and is currently\n&gt;&gt;&gt; unknown.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Against this backdrop it would seem that it would be quite difficult to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; demonstrate with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; any clarity or precision that any specific individual (living or\n&gt;&gt;&gt; deceased) was indeed affecting\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the Ouija (or any other device for that matter). It would all come down\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to beliefs which is the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; best we can hope for at this time.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; So &#39;scientific&#39; proof per se is off the table if you define &#39;scientific&#39;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in the classic sense.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If you mean objective proof, in some way documenting activity such as by\n&gt;&gt;&gt; video for example,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that is a different matter. But to be very clear, this would not be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; considered scientific proof\n&gt;&gt;&gt; because you are cannot demonstrate the causation. You can however\n&gt;&gt;&gt; document the effect.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Blood Mary (the ritual of Mary Worth) is considered by most to be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; folk-legend. So it would\n&gt;&gt;&gt; be difficult, would it not, to ascertain who in fact you were\n&gt;&gt;&gt; communicating with. And again,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; there is a real possiblity, based on existing lab research from the past\n&gt;&gt;&gt; many decades that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; you just might be communicating with yourself.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Best of luck in your endeavors!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; -------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey guys,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I am doing some research on the Bloody Mary ritual and Ouija Boards.
