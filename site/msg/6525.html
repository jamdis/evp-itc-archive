Recently I heard part of a commercial on C2C about a radio called 5Y or Y5 or something like that.  Anyway, the commercial was balleyhooing something about getting the best reception in the world on at least these five stations.   Then again, maybe I dreamed it.  But I do think it aired on coast 2 coast and probably is on that station alot.  I don't get C2C here on a regular basis.  Sooo, my question is, does anyone know about a special radio system...maybe it is satellite generated...and, how would that fit with our work.  Ron L
