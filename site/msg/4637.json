I met him about 3 years\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ago.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My husband is a commercial photographer and Mark asked him to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; portrait for a book he was coming out with. He came to our home\n&gt; &gt; &gt; studio\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the portrait, and I got to talk with him a little about what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does. At that time all I knew of EVP was from the White Noise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; movie,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t sure it was real. But Mark was very nice, passionate  \n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ITC/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EVP and very convincing. I wasn&#39;t quite sure what to expect  \n&gt; when I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; originally heard what he did, with all the loonies out there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; claiming\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all kinds of stuff, but I got a really good feeling from him and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very, well, like I said, convincing. After that I went to his  \n&gt; web\n&gt; &gt; &gt; site\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and also bought one of his books, which was a nice read.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I went to the Stanley Hotel in November with a ghost hunting  \n&gt; group\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mark was a speaker there.

I forgot to answer: No, I have not given up ghost  \n&gt; hunting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all, but over the years I have come to focus more on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; collection\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and distribution of experiences than on encountering phenomena\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself. ITC has really affirmed this for me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve felt all along that my job is to make people aware that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual phenomena go on all the time in millions of  \n&gt; lives; I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a scientist and I know nothing I do will change the way  \n&gt; science\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinks. BUT if I can open the minds of young people today,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our future scientists will make it their business to figure  \n&gt; all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know this is a lot of what ITC experimenters are doing:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; convincing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others of the afterlife by their recorded evidence. Amazing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; things\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can happen when THAT happens.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, Mark Macy is so wonderful because he has dedicated his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; life\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to this. He and his colleagues have received such detailed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; descriptions of how the afterlife works, that they have helped\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; living change their lives to erase the fear of death--and  \n&gt; to live\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a way that brings us to as high a spiritual level as possible\n&gt; &gt; &gt; right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away when our bodies die. This means, for example, dealing  \n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issues and addictions, that plague us in life, since the  \n&gt; spirits\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tell us we take it all with us! That is, death isn&#39;t a cure- \n&gt; all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any glimpse at the history of ITC shows us that all of this  \n&gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gradually growing since the 19th century, when state-of-the- \n&gt; art\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; graphite pencils and telegraphs were used to contact the dead.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since then, there have been &quot;breakthroughs&quot; a number of times\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; astounding floods of messages have come through.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You experimenters are all so incredible--I&#39;m amazed every  \n&gt; day at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your love, dedication and faith. Surely something wonderful is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to come from all this, and I think it&#39;s going to come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; during\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our lifetimes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ursula\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robin Searcy Henson &lt;MudPuddleFarm@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello Bill,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I did steal that phrase from Ursula because I thought it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; described what I was doing as compared to what I would like to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I like what you said about focus on the equipment helping to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; establish the psychic connection.

There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who believe that communication is between the conscious  \n&gt; of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; researcher and the entity and the equipment is secondary.  \n&gt; It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get swept up in the technology and forget there is  \n&gt; possibly a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; psychic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connection going on. With that said, focusing on equipment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can help the researcher become receptive to establishing a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication link. While paying attention to the equipment,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forget\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about the daily distractions and minor irritations that may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prevent us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from establishing contact.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The setting up the gear we use could be considered the first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; part of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;ritual&quot;.

Despite some of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; benefits\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the new gear, the one that I seem to have a connection  \n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that requires a little more finesse to operate. -Bill\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robin Henson&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;MudPuddleFarm@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wow, thanks for your help guys!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ursula, your post was lovely.

I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think I&#39;m a little bored.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve felt pretty strongly that I&#39;ve been communicating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small number of entities, and I&#39;m wondering if  \n&gt; that&#39;s due\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limitations of my equipment. My most impressive EVPs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; captured around my own home, particularly outside  \n&gt; on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hill and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near the barn. I&#39;ve gotten two inside my house (after\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inviting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been  \n&gt; negative\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messages.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;m thinking about getting another DVR and  \n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your thoughts and recommendations about which ones are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; best. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like to communicate with more advanced entities\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eventually,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunately don&#39;t have the brain for building  \n&gt; anything\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
