There is no set layout, or design,=\r\n it&#39;s just where ever the stuff fits. I tend to put the sweep in the upper =\r\nleft corner of the board as I&#39;m workign on it, although in the pix it looks=\r\n like in the lower right corner. The tuner is oriented on as different side=\r\n than on #31. I start by locating the tuner, whether it&#39;s home made, or one=\r\n of these modules, then I place the power terminal. Then place the chip soc=\r\nkets. Then I start with wiring the power to each chip, and proceed from the=\r\nre. I use orange for minus 12 volts, red for plus 12, and plus 8 volts, and=\r\n green for all grounds. It&#39;s just to help in troubelshooting if needed. I u=\r\nse a ground bus around the under side of the board edge.  I use #24 scrap t=\r\nelephone wire just because it free.  I install phone and network lines. \n \n=\r\n You have to use shielded wire for the speaker lines, or there&#39;s too much f=\r\needback to the mic circuits by induction. \n \n These tuner modules are from =\r\nold scraped boxes, # 3, and #11. The noise pick up from the white noise cir=\r\ncuit was so bad that the tuner wouldn&#39;t work, the RF signals being complete=\r\nly drowned out by white noise, which has been a major problem with the boxe=\r\ns since day one, and why I find the random mode so easy to abandon. These t=\r\nuner modules work just fine without the white noise, and the systems work v=\r\nery well in linear mode.\n \n The &quot;Range&quot; and &quot;Center&quot; controls alow the tuni=\r\nng to be narrowed to a specific area in the AM band, such as the supposed R=\r\naudive frequency of 1485 khz. It&#39;s an experimental mode that I was putting =\r\nin the boxes, but never had time to play with.  The &quot;Range&quot; can be turned a=\r\nll the way down, and &quot;Center&quot; used as manual tuning. \n \n I was going to apo=\r\nlogize for getting harsh last Friday, but I make the boxes, I understand ho=\r\nw it works, and how to make it work, yet some with no knowledge of technolo=\r\ngy, or the boxes, think they can presume to tell me how it really works, to=\r\n limit it to a &quot;chosen&quot; few, I think--I get pissed. Now I don&#39;t know how th=\r\ne spirits actually form their voices, but I do know that just about anythin=\r\ng that provides a raw audio that they can use to make a voice will be used,=\r\n and it doesn&#39;t matter if the sound is random, or linear. \n \n Frank-S\n_____=\r\n____________________________________________________________\nNeed to know t=\r\nhe score, the latest news, or you need your Hotmail=AE-get your &quot;fix&quot;.\nhttp=\r\n://www.msnmobilefix.com/Default.aspx\r\n--_c967dbb6-8511-4433-addb-cbd2db39df24_\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;\n.hmmessage P\n{\nmargin:0px;\npadding:0px\n}\nbody.hmmessa=\r\nge\n{\nFONT-SIZE: 10pt;\nFONT-FAMILY:Tahoma\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body class=3D&#39;=\r\nhmmessage&#39;&gt;\n&nbsp;This is just to show the board layout.
