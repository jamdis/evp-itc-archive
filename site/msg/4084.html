<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi LC,

No, those files I posted here in the files area are from just the 12-
470 as it did a linear sweep of the AM or FM band, with no chamber or 
white noise or amp mic. I was walking in our local cemetery hold the 
modified 12-470 near the gravesite of those I questioned.  I have not 
posted any audio from the Mike&#x27;s Box 12-470 system or the Spiricomp 
12-469 system yet.  I plan to do one of my internet radio shows where 
I will debut some of the audio files from those systems.
You can listen at http://www.ghosttoghostpm.com on the dates those 
will broadcast.  I have a 2 hour show on Tuesday&#x27;s and Friday&#x27;s. Each 
show gets between 400 and 1200 listeners, mostly from archive 
downloads after the LIVE show is over. Next Friday will be the first 
show where I debut the newer audio files.

- Mike

&gt; Mike, I have one more question for clarification.  
&gt; 
&gt; I listened to the various voice recordings you captured and do I 
&gt; understand correctly that the little portable-enclosed system 
&gt; (pictured on your blog) captured the audio we&#x27;ve heard from you to 
&gt; date?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.

&gt; &gt; Hi LC,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The two setups I did were:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1) Three 12-469&#x27;s through a mixer, mixed with white noise 
&gt; (performed 
&gt; &gt; with Audacity), my voice via a microphone, and all that audio 
&gt; &gt; captured using a free program called &quot;Scanner Recorder&quot;. You can 
&gt; &gt; download it here: http://www.davee.com/scanrec/
&gt; &gt; I have not really taken that unit anywhere to test it properly.  
I 
&gt; &gt; only did the original testing you hear on the video.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2) One 12-470 placed in a &quot;chamber&quot;, with a noise generator (used 
&gt; &gt; a &quot;My Lil&#x27; Reminder&quot; 20 second digital recorder/player) with 
&gt; recorded 
&gt; &gt; white/pink noise I captured while in Florida.  Also inside is 
&gt; &gt; a &quot;Listen Up&quot; amplified microphone and an Olympus digital 
recorder.
&gt; &gt; The only wiring is a Y-connector which connects the output from 
the 
&gt; &gt; amplified mic to the input of the recorder, and also to ear-buds 
&gt; for 
&gt; &gt; listening to what is being recorded. You can also plug a small 
&gt; &gt; speaker into this if desired.
&gt; &gt; The raw audio from the linear sweep of either the AM or FM band 
is 
&gt; &gt; projected from the 12-470 speaker, into the closed &quot;chamber&quot;, 
along 
&gt; &gt; with the audio from the speaker of the noise generator (&quot;My Lil&#x27; 
&gt; &gt; Reminder&quot;) unit.  Those two sources, plus any ambient noise 
inside 
&gt; &gt; the &quot;chamber&quot; is picked up by the amplified mic and fed into the 
&gt; &gt; recorder and ear-buds. The recorder produces the .wav file.
&gt; &gt; You can use a 12-469 instead of the 12-470. You just need to 
&gt; connect 
&gt; &gt; a small speker to the output of the 12-469.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As with my three 12-469 system, I have so far only done the 
initial 
&gt; &gt; test run on th 12-470 system.  I hope to bring both units to a 
&gt; place 
&gt; &gt; where I can do some better experimentation.  I have 2 weeks off 
&gt; near 
&gt; &gt; Christmas time, so that is probably when I&#x27;ll be doing that.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I hope I have answered your questions, LC.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - Mike

&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Today I modified my Radio Shack 12-469, but have some 
questions.  
&gt; &gt; It 
&gt; &gt; &gt; was easy to do, and I instantly plugged it into my Olympus 
voice 
&gt; &gt; &gt; recorder and recorded off of it easily.  Now I want to pipe 
some 
&gt; &gt; &gt; white noise in (and ambient), as well. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Is the set-up in your video what has worked best for you 
(with 
&gt; &gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; computer and all)?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Will you tell us what free computer programs you used (I 
think 
&gt; &gt; one 
&gt; &gt; &gt; is Audacity)?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) What microphone and white noise generator did you use for 
your 
&gt; &gt; &gt; travel pack unit pictured on UFOGeek.com (posted on December 
&gt; 8th)?  
&gt; &gt; &gt; And can you give me a layout for the wiring of it - you know, 
how 
&gt; &gt; it 
&gt; &gt; &gt; all hooks together?  I&#x27;ll figure it out sooner or later, but 
I&#x27;d 
&gt; &gt; &gt; rather it be sooner!
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, LC
&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am currently putting together another video, just like my 
&gt; &gt; others 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; showing a very practical way to use the Radio Shack Hack 
&gt; devices.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You probably saw my 12-469 practical use videos, now I&#x27;m 
going 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sharing a 12-470 practical use video.  This one is of a 
totally 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; portable system that uses a noise generator, the hacked 12-
470, 
&gt; a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; digital (or analog) recorder, and a microphone which gathers 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; raw 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; audio sweep, white noise (or in my case a special white/pink 
&gt; &gt; noise 
&gt; &gt; &gt; file 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I created), and any ambient noise within a chamber.. and 
places 
&gt; &gt; &gt; that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; session int a .wav file.  It also includes an ear piece so 
you 
&gt; &gt; can 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hear, real time, what the digital recorder is recording (the 
&gt; &gt; mixer 
&gt; &gt; &gt; of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the session sound within the chamber).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stay tuned for that video later today....
