I wouldn't say I am skeptical about the existence of ghosts, what we CALL 
=
ghosts certainly exist, but I am of two minds as to if we may be dealing 
w=
ith actual "dead" people. 

 I can also be open to that they MIGHT be LIVE =
people that we are simply 
seeing and interacting with across a kind of nat=
ural or energy induced 
TIMESPACE WARP.   And to them WE might be the "ghos=
ts".---There should be 
a way to tell if "ghosts" are ghosts in the usually=
 accepted sense or are 
they actually living people seen through a temporal=
 anomaly?

That really is one of the FIRST questions I want to resolve.

I've heard the same said for the =
evp researchers!  But it's not that 
simple in either case:
the last block =
that you reference has small print that says "Compare the 
hypothesis to th=
e experiment's conclusion".  Which of course you can't do 
unless you alrea=
dy visited the hypothesis block and have a hypothesis to 
which to compare.=
  That in turn has small print which says "predict the 
outcome of the prob=
lem", which of course you can't do either unless you've 
already visited th=
e earlier block of Purpose ("state the problem").

I don't think it's helpf=
ul to deny good evidence, whether it is good 
evidence from someone claimin=
g to have detected spirits, or whether it is 
good evidence from someone cl=
aiming that people can mistake noise for 
speech or random radio tunings fo=
r spirit control.  That's why the 
scientific method is valuable: it keeps =
both the skeptic and the believer
