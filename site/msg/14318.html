You know what is amusing?  Where in the video on  UTube, C. Moon tells one 
of the people, that "financial gain isn't the same  thing" that was when a 
lady asked if spirit could give her the lotto  number's, then said something 
about her sister having a cesarean section,  but he charges them over 100. 
each so is this not financial gain?  C.  Moon is making money from spirit's 
why would not these same spirit's help this  woman out too, they have no 
choice with C. Moon, because Spirit must use him in  order to speak with loved 
ones, it's same for those on this side longing to hear  from the loved ones 
as well, so what is worse?  A woman asking  for financial help from spirit or 
someone making money off the hearts of  other's?   And,  If anyone is too 
make money at this time, it  should be those developers, the people investing 
in a company of  electronic people, like those person's on this list, they  
could use the money to buy materials they might need to develop the boxes.  
 Those guys and gals fixing these boxes, radio's, so they can get together  
to build a company, and perfect something we in society can all use one  
day.  Just my take, sf

not my business what people plan, I just would like someone to perfect my  
spirit watch <g> so I can stay in touch with my loved ones.

I noticed on Chris Moon's Myspace blog he posted:

"People also  have a misconception that Mr. Sumption and I are at war which 
is not true.  As a matter of fact we have tentative plans for a joint 
research project  this fall."

Maybe Frank could shed some more light on this  partnership?
