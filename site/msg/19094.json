The results still never cease to amaze me! \n\nAnyhow, I came across this device at an estate auction. It appears to be an \nantique communication device of some sort. The only verifiable information I \nhave is that is was probably built around 1910-1912, which is before radio was \npublicly available. \n(I obtained this date from researching the packaging cylinder used to build the \ndevice.) \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on what it might be? I did show this device to \nChris a while back and he agreed that it probably was a communication device. He \nalso suggested I show it to Frank... = )\nAccording to Chris&#39;s box, &quot;this IS a communication device of historical value.&quot; \nIt also mentioned the device was &quot;meant specifically for me to have, but no \nlonger worked.&quot; There was more, but I&#39;m trying to remain unbiased and only \nuse tangible evidence. However, I have little to go on.\n\nIf anyone has any clues or can lead me in a research direction I would \nappreciate it! Thanks!\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-1929457261-1288033489=:59027\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I&#39;ll be the first to admit I&#39;m no expert when it comes to ITC.
