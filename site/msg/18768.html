Going through some stuff today and came across this box.  Ron from  
paranormalsystems.com only sold a dozen of these and i think 11 came back to  him.  
That project was a disaster from start to finish.  I tried to  help, but 
cheap parts were used to build it.
 
I took it apart today to look and see what i can do to improve it.   The 
first thing i noticed was a crappy antenna, so i swapped it out with one  from 
a broken radio sitting here.
 
Reception did improve, but it still sucks.  It's like polishing a  
turd......Sorry, i know that was disgusting.
 
This box is AM Random mode only.  I think when you try to get too  advanced 
with building these, that's when the problems start.  Simple is  the best 
way to do it.  I've attached the raw audio of the test with it and  some 
sample files i got.
 
Now i guess it goes back into the closet where i got it from.
