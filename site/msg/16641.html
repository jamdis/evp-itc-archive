Try this option out for size.

The Box clearly is a translator/tuner for the entities, to speak to you.
Obviously you are able to 'understand' or 'translate' what the box says. 
When you hear the entities speak to you.
  It would follow, that there is some kind of tuning in going on, after 
all.
And it also seems to me that maybe you are also 'tuning' in psychically 
while using the box, just its subtle.

I gather that unless prompted people may occasionally hear/perceive 
different things, there was a thread to that effect not too long ago.

Well thats my two cents worth, but Franks congrats, its an exciting 
time.  Enjoy! and keep us in the loop.
