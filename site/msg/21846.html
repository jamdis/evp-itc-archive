[EVP-ITC] semi new


=C2=A0 
Hello. I'm sort of new to the group. I've been=
 observing but not posting much. Most of my experiences have been personal =
and I have decided to take it up a notch and join a group. My trouble has b=
een that most groups I have encountered are simply unorganized or unmotivat=
ed (in it for the t-shirts). I went with a group recently to an old cabin f=
or what turned out to be an hour and a half investigation. I got around 8 E=
VPs, some photos, and a couple of noise responses on my recorder. My first =
attempt with a flash light got me a half an hour worth of consistent respon=
ses. When I got my first recorder I got 3 EVPs while reading the instructio=
ns. I'm a magnet and for the first time in my life it doesn't scare me. Wha=
t does scare me is that my kids are just as effected. So I want to learn as=
 much as I can on an interactive level so I can not only educate myself but=
 protect my kids. Is anyone in the Toledo area interested in doing investig=
ations?

Here is my personal page. It's a freebie website that I recently s=
tarted to organize some of my evidence. Don't mind the construction. But he=
re's a link to my EVPs on my recent investigation I mentioned above. I very=
 much would appreciate any feedback or comments.

click here to see me rece=
nt evps

I would like to also know if anyone is familiar with the name "Att=
oy" (guess of spelling)

I recently tried communicating on a box I got off =
of Ebay. I asked for a name and heard "toy". I asked again and I again hear=
d "toy".
I didn't think much of it until later that day my 2 year old climb=
s on my lap, looks at an empty space, gets very excited, starts waving and =
says "toy a toy"
I later asked my 3 year old if she knew anybody named "toy=
" and she corrected me by saying "Atoy. He's a boy." I asked her how old he=
 was. She looked confused for a second and replied "He's still 4." She said=
 he's happy, not sick, little like her, and only says nice words. When I as=
ked her where she met him she replied "the living room." When I asked her h=
ow long he's been there she unhesitatingly began to reply "5 years" but onl=
y said "5 ye" She doesn't understand the concept of a year. She did say he'=
s been there as long as she can remember. I can remember my older daughter =
in a previous house smiling and saying "hi" to nothing as a baby. I have EV=
P's of breaths from the house as well. They all sound like children. One I =
have is of what I believe to be cheyne stokes. I only recognized this becau=
se I'm a nurse. It's a particular breathing pattern that people sometimes h=
ave with imminent death. I would appreciate any suggestions on how to commu=
nicate
 more with him.
