<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanx Frank, it is a simple radio built with a FM chip.  My friend 
Joe built it for me.  The box doesn&#x27;t have an echo box, but seems to 
work.  I have 2 FM radios which are identical and a 3rd being built  
based off your schematics for comparison.  The guy building them is 
a retired engineer who is loving these projects and i&#x27;m loving using 
them.  I just sit at home and get results.  It does take a little 
time to acquire an ear for it, but once you stick with it you get 
positive results.  Joe Cioppi is the man behind the curtain of these 
simple FM boxes, he&#x27;s a member on here and i believe you e-mail him 
on occasion.  He&#x27;s a great guy and he&#x27;s has good ideas.  I would 
like to hear one of your boxes in action to compare the audio if you 
have any audio clips i can hear.  My main e-mail is ( 
Urkel23@...m )  I&#x27;ll keep posting more audio as i get it and 
thanx for the feedback, this is what i&#x27;ve been waiting for and i 
appreciate it.

&gt; This is great! I think it shows that it&#x27;s the raw audio that 
matters. To me 
&gt; there seems to be many that think my boxes are like somekind of 
oracle or 
&gt; something, and they miss the fact that it&#x27;s only supplying the raw 
audio for 
&gt; spirits to form their voices with. I don&#x27;t want to cheapen the 
experience, 
&gt; but I want to show that it is more of a science now, it&#x27;s 
repeatable, and 
&gt; other systems can be made that do the same thing. This FM scan 
method has 
&gt; the advantage of fewer parts, smaller boards, and seemingly easier 
to use. I 
&gt; think this system would be marketable.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks Steve for posting your voices!

&gt; &gt;This was just sitting at home asking simple questions.
