For example, if I had a \n  =\r\n                program in some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it co=\r\nuld \n                  compress it.&nbsp; But if it lost even one bit, the =\r\nresulting \n                  exe file would not execute again after it was =\r\nuncompressed on \n                  the other side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This kind of comp=\r\nression does things \n                  like looking for common patterns in =\r\nthe file, and replacing \n                  them with a token.&nbsp; A rough=\r\n example would be if it found \n                  &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot; in a file=\r\n 20 times, it could replace all the \n                  occurances with say =\r\n$HN1.&nbsp; And also write a little \n                  dictionary in there =\r\nsomeplace that says &quot;$HN1=3DHowdy \n                  Neighbor&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When=\r\n the file gets to its destination it can \n                  be uncompressed=\r\n, and all occurences of $HN1 are replaced with \n                  &quot;Howdy Ne=\r\nighbor&quot;.&nbsp; So it was compressed (instead of 14 \n                  chara=\r\ncters each, it only needed 4, plus the dictionary), but \n                  =\r\nlost no data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not \n            =\r\n      lossless.&nbsp; Depending on the level of compression, some \n        =\r\n          level of data is lost, and so cannot be recovered or \n           =\r\n       reconstructed later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rick&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Sun, \n    =\r\n              5/10/09, April Abercrombie &lt;i&gt;&lt;april@abercrombiegh \n      =\r\n            ostresearch. com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Imagine taking a picture \n           =\r\n                 of a field of flowers, and beginning to add levels \n      =\r\n                      or pixelization to the picture.&nbsp; Soon, you \n    =\r\n                        would not be able to tell there were flowers there =\r\n\n                            at all.&nbsp; You would see a lot of colored \n=\r\n                            blocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or in the other direction, imagi=\r\nne \n                            you are looking at a competely randomize bu=\r\nnch of \n                            pixes on your screen: a complete screen=\r\n of truely \n                            random static snow.&nbsp; Pixelizin=\r\ng this, after a \n                            while, you would again start t=\r\no see colored \n                            blocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What&#39;s happening =\r\nis that it is \n                            processing an area of the image,=\r\n taking (for \n                            instance) the average value of th=\r\nat entire area, and \n                            replacing all the blocks i=\r\nn that area with the \n                            average.&nbsp; In video p=\r\nrocessing, this would \n                            result in a field of mul=\r\nti-colored flowers being \n                            replaced by, for inst=\r\nance, a big greyish-bluish \n                            block, with no rese=\r\nmblance to flowers.&nbsp; In the \n                            noise example=\r\n, it maybe replace all the random \n                            pixels with =\r\nanother big greyish-bluish block.&nbsp; \n                            If you=\r\n did not know beforehand what the original \n                            pic=\r\nture was, you couldn&#39;t tell whether your \n                            pixel=\r\nized image was really a field of flowers, a \n                            ch=\r\nevy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of \n                           =\r\n pixels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It works the same with the sound \n                         =\r\n   files.&nbsp; Taking something as complex as speech, \n                   =\r\n         and replacing frequencies with their averages, loses \n            =\r\n                the speech the farther you go, until you head \n            =\r\n                strange fluctuating square waves.&nbsp; Doing the \n        =\r\n                    same to random static will eventually produce the \n    =\r\n                        same thing.&nbsp; And random fluctuating square \n  =\r\n                          waves can sound a bit like speech - or at least, =\r\nyou \n                            could have fun sharing with each other wha=\r\nt you \n                            thing they &#39;sound like&#39;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- \n                            On &lt;b&gt;Sun, 5/10/09, Misty Dawn &lt;i&gt;=\r\n&lt;bulletbabea@ \n                            yahoo.com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
