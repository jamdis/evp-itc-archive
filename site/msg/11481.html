<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>To use tubes you have to just use higher voltage DC blocking 
capacitors in the oscillator to block the voltages from varactors. I&#x27;m 
not sure it would work any better than a solid state tuner though. You 
can even replace the tunning capacitor in a portable radio with 
varactors. There&#x27;s lots of room for variations. 

 I have the sweep circuits on PCB, using ExpressPCB&#x27;s mini boards. 3 
boards=$60. The voices I just posted were done with the PCBs and a car 
tuner. Components are marked on the silk screen, although there is no 
silk screen on the boards themselves after they are manufacured. The 
boards are designed to be used with a varity of tuners. There is a few 
surface mount components in the mic bias circuit, and tone control, but 
as with these latest voices, I was not using those, and they could be 
left off if need be.

&gt;  I am in search of a few answers pertaining to Franks Box. Can anyone 
&gt; direct me to a schematic inclusive of instructions as to the design 
of 
&gt; a Franks Box. Secondly I as to the am band units, can they only be 
&gt; devised and constrcuted with transistor circuits only or can the 
&gt; technique be applied to older tube sets as well?? I ask only because 
I 
&gt; would like to test some theories and thoughts. My sincere thanks to 
all 
&gt; for your time and replies.
