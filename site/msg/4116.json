The 12-470 sweeping raw audio comes out of the 12-470 speaker as does the white noise come out of the speaker from that device. Both units sound are fed into the chamber where they mix with any ambient noise, then the amp mic picks it up, feeds it to the recorder which records it. I could have just used the built-in mic on the recorder but the amp mic adds a little better tone, also you could have the recorder outside the case if you want, which would be a more ideal thing if you use a larger recorder or a tape recorder. That way the motor noise would not mix inside the chamber.- Mike--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Wow, that&#39;s impressive, Mike, as concerning the functionality, ease &gt; of use, etc. &gt; &gt; So if I understand correctly, you asked a question (which was picked &gt; up by the Olympus voice recorder&#39;s built-in microphone), the 12-470 &gt; was plugged directly into the Olympus voice recorder to record the AM &gt; or FM sweep for about 10 seconds after the question, correct?&gt; &gt; Sounds like what I have been playing with.&gt; &gt; LC Duplatt&gt; http://www.AngelsGhosts.com&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; &gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hi LC,&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, those files I posted here in the files area are from just the &gt; 12-&gt; &gt; 470 as it did a linear sweep of the AM or FM band, with no chamber &gt; or &gt; &gt; white noise or amp mic. I was walking in our local cemetery hold &gt; the &gt; &gt; modified 12-470 near the gravesite of those I questioned. I have &gt; not &gt; &gt; posted any audio from the Mike&#39;s Box 12-470 system or the Spiricomp &gt; &gt; 12-469 system yet. I plan to do one of my internet radio shows &gt; where &gt; &gt; I will debut some of the audio files from those systems.&gt; &gt; You can listen at http://www.ghosttoghostpm.com on the dates those &gt; &gt; will broadcast. I have a 2 hour show on Tuesday&#39;s and Friday&#39;s. &gt; Each &gt; &gt; show gets between 400 and 1200 listeners, mostly from archive &gt; &gt; downloads after the LIVE show is over. Next Friday will be the &gt; first &gt; &gt; show where I debut the newer audio files.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Mike&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike, I have one more question for clarification. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I listened to the various voice recordings you captured and do I &gt; &gt; &gt; understand correctly that the little portable-enclosed system &gt; &gt; &gt; (pictured on your blog) captured the audio we&#39;ve heard from you &gt; to &gt; &gt; &gt; date?&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LC Duplatt&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.AngelsGhosts.com&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi LC,&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The two setups I did were:&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Three 12-469&#39;s through a mixer, mixed with white noise &gt; &gt; &gt; (performed &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with Audacity), my voice via a microphone, and all that audio &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; captured using a free program called &quot;Scanner Recorder&quot;. You &gt; can &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; download it here: http://www.davee.com/scanrec/&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have not really taken that unit anywhere to test it &gt; properly. &gt; &gt; I &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only did the original testing you hear on the video.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) One 12-470 placed in a &quot;chamber&quot;, with a noise generator &gt; (used &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;My Lil&#39; Reminder&quot; 20 second digital recorder/player) with &gt; &gt; &gt; recorded &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; white/pink noise I captured while in Florida. Also inside is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;Listen Up&quot; amplified microphone and an Olympus digital &gt; &gt; recorder.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only wiring is a Y-connector which connects the output from &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; amplified mic to the input of the recorder, and also to ear-&gt; buds &gt; &gt; &gt; for &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; listening to what is being recorded. You can also plug a small &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speaker into this if desired.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The raw audio from the linear sweep of either the AM or FM band &gt; &gt; is &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; projected from the 12-470 speaker, into the closed &quot;chamber&quot;, &gt; &gt; along &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with the audio from the speaker of the noise generator (&quot;My &gt; Lil&#39; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reminder&quot;) unit. Those two sources, plus any ambient noise &gt; &gt; inside &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;chamber&quot; is picked up by the amplified mic and fed into &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recorder and ear-buds. The recorder produces the .wav file.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can use a 12-469 instead of the 12-470. You just need to &gt; &gt; &gt; connect &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a small speker to the output of the 12-469.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As with my three 12-469 system, I have so far only done the &gt; &gt; initial &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test run on th 12-470 system. I hope to bring both units to a &gt; &gt; &gt; place &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where I can do some better experimentation. I have 2 weeks off &gt; &gt; &gt; near &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Christmas time, so that is probably when I&#39;ll be doing that.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope I have answered your questions, LC.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Mike&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mike,&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Today I modified my Radio Shack 12-469, but have some &gt; &gt; questions. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was easy to do, and I instantly plugged it into my Olympus &gt; &gt; voice &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recorder and recorded off of it easily. Now I want to pipe &gt; &gt; some &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; white noise in (and ambient), as well. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Is the set-up in your video what has worked best for you &gt; &gt; (with &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computer and all)?&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Will you tell us what free computer programs you used (I &gt; &gt; think &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is Audacity)?&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) What microphone and white noise generator did you use for &gt; &gt; your &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; travel pack unit pictured on UFOGeek.com (posted on December &gt; &gt; &gt; 8th)? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And can you give me a layout for the wiring of it - you know, &gt; &gt; how &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all hooks together?
