Maybe 15 years old or more, \nand only on their volition, that is only if they had an interest. \n\n I can&#39;t work with Mr. Moon, I do not agree with his &quot;theories&quot; about \nthe paranormal, or how the box works. I would be willing to discuss \nit, but I&#39;m not going to be told how it is. I don&#39;t think there is a \ndanger, other than suggestion, which members of this society are \nreally good at giving themselves. \n\n As far as &quot;testing&quot; all I can ask is ---Why!? This stuff is highly \nsubjective, I know what I hear, and I know it works, I know I get \nmeanningful messages. Others won&#39;t hear what I hear --a test is \nmeaningless!\n\n I think we create all this stuff, voices, hauntings--everything. \n \n Frank-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;babiarz3&quot; &lt;babiarz3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; A few weeks ago I posted that Rick Moran had written an article\n&gt; stating that children and high school students would be part of the\n&gt; testing subjects of the mini-box. Later that day the article was\n&gt; replaced with a different article about the mini-box. I was told \nthat\n&gt; I was stating mis truths. I wasn&#39;t. I finally was able to locate the\n&gt; missing article. I&#39;m providing a link to the entire article along \nwith\n&gt; the statement regarding our children. If the link somehow becomes\n&gt; unavailable, I have done a screen shot and will provide it to \nwhoever\n&gt; asks.\n&gt; Believe me when I say that this isn&#39;t to cause or stir crap. I was\n&gt; basically called a liar and this clears up that misconception. If I \nam\n&gt; banned from this group for telling the truth, than so be it. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;...it was not the question of whether the phenomenon existed to \nbegin\n&gt; with, but rather what is the phenomenon.  That will require a good\n&gt; deal more effort to explore and beginning in January we will be\n&gt; undertaking test sessions all over north and east Texas as well as\n&gt; other national locations with a wide variety of folks to see what\n&gt; happens within the group dynamic.  The testing will include folks \nwho\n&gt; are both believers and non-believers, skeptics, critics, other\n&gt; researchers, children, high school students, college and grad\n&gt; students, and senior citizens to name a few categories.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.asup-inc.org/pages/editorial11-29-07.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you willing to &quot;see what happens&quot; with our children?\n&gt;"}
