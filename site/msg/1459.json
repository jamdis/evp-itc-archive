Those of \nus that believe in this ongoing project like to spend time not only \nkeeping up with the development of the Box, but also listening \nclosely to the output. A bar graph display is a nice addition. -Bill  \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; This is the sweep board that goes with the newest tuner/audio \nboard. I made \n&gt; one change not shown, I&#39;m using a bargraph display for the tuning \nvoltage \n&gt; instead of a meter(I had one in the junk box). So for the \nnewest &quot;proto \n&gt; type&quot; there is two schematics, sweep, and the tuner. This system is \nmuch \n&gt; more complicated than I would like, and it still makes it look like \nexotic \n&gt; technology, it is in fact, just a radio, and the tuning system.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was curious in setting up this latest sweep board, something \nchanged, I no \n&gt; longer could use the pull down resistors to compensate for the DC \noffset \n&gt; from the op amps. I used only one pull down on the RVG pulse amp.\n&gt; \n&gt; I used the tantalum capacitors in the white noise amp, the \nadvantage being a \n&gt; faster start up time. Larger aluminum caps can be used, such as \n100uf-16volt \n&gt; caps. It takes about 20 seconds for the white noise to come up, and \nit still \n&gt; takes one minute before the VT signals comes on. On the other hand, \nthe \n&gt; linear sweep is on as soon as power is turned on, and with this \nsweep \n&gt; version, the triangle is on all the time, so modes can be switched \nwihtout \n&gt; the warm up period.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is how I spend my hoildays----but boring!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; FYI---- Mine!  I don&#39;t have a usable system to run sessions on, I \nkeep \n&gt; giving them away! Besides, I&#39;d like to keep the first home made \nAM/FM tuner \n&gt; board.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; http://liveearth.msn.com\n&gt;"}
