<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s a logical assumption, but I don&#x27;t think it can be accepted as  
fact. We just don&#x27;t know yet.

&gt; Often times, gorups of lower level entities work as a group. They  
&gt; will often have a central type of leader...and will stay with that  
&gt; leader until they grow tired and move away to try to find new  
&gt; experiences.

&gt;&gt; First off, the Fish Group aren&#x27;t &quot;people&quot;. They are not and  
&gt;&gt; haven&#x27;t ever been human. I have no idea where you get this idea. &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I said that because all of the examples I heard of EVP by the Fish  
&gt; Group has sounded very human and they have never claimed to have  
&gt; been other than human that I have heard. I have to base my  
&gt; conclusions on the EVP files, not speculation, even from the  
&gt; victims. Do you know of instances where they audibly claimed to be  
&gt; nonhuman? I may have missed them--I heard a lot of EVPs from them,  
&gt; but certainly not the sum total. (As I said--I even got one myself  
&gt; the other day.)
&gt;
&gt; I think you&#x27;re right that they are definitely mobile, and a  
&gt; collective.
