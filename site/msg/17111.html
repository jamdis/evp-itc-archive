The same voice converted to mp3 using sound recorder. It's windows program.
go to programs--accessories--entertainment--sound recorder. Open the file,
the go to properties--convert now, then pick mpeg-3, and "save as". takes
about 3.26 seconds for the whole process.  This one is 28k your original
over a meg, smaller to save, faster to send.
