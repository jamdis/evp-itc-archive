Usually I record in my bedroom office unless I am doing other \nmethods. \n\nI think most of us go thru periods of adjustment or different \nperception. Perhaps over time we get better, they get clearer, and \nequipment changes to suit our needs.\n\nYou are off to a good start, you can hear them, and you record with \nthe right intent. That in iteself should attract a few more to speak \nwith you.\n\nMisty\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Pridegrl Neverumind \n&lt;charmedbyu20032003@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Misty,\n&gt;    \n&gt;   nope, I used water noise only one time ( i had no choice, i was \ninvestigating my sisters house and she has two aquariums with water \nfilter noise)\n&gt;   the rest of my evps i do at home with no background noise.\n&gt;   I know what you mean about slowing down evp files. For the first \nyear and a half i got evps that mostly had to be slowed down a great \ndeal. I had problems with software and ended up not working with \nfiles that had to be slowed down.\n&gt;   Perhaps the spirits I talk to realised they better speak slowly \nfor me to hear them! lol I still do get evps that are very fast but \nhave cleaer ones to keep me busy...lol\n&gt;   where do you do your recordings?\n&gt;   Charm\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;             Charm,\n&gt;    \n&gt;   You still recording with the water in the background? Many seem \nto enjoy using water to form the voice and your setup is close to my \nh2o background noise. I tend to test alot of methods, some they \napprove of some they complain about but with water they never \ncomplain about the method. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   I noticed a big difference between your files and mine tho, most \nof my voices stick to that supersonic speed level so ya have to slow \nit down -74 to hear them normal speed but most of yours are contained \nin normal rate of speed playback.

I asked \nthem if they were a&#39;&#39;couple&#39; and monique said &#39;yes we are&#39;and peter \nsaid &#39;no we&#39;re not&#39; so i guess they are having a bit of fun with \nme.  ;)\n&gt;   Im not sure what you mean by a hack, ( i do know what you mean \nby &#39;box&#39;--like franks box or a spiricom- which no- i use neither of \nthese things) however a good friend of mine is coming over tongiht \nand i plan to try and fandangle him into building me a spiricom \ndevice...... *crossing fingers* lol! \n&gt;   I have been doing evps about 3 years now and just the other day i \nfound several that Peter and Monique identify themselves by name- and \nthey were with me when i lived in a different house 3 years ago... so \nwhen I heard them again on my recorder recently- i thought i would \ntry and see just how much info they can share with me.. I have gotten \nLOTS of evps from other ppl in this house i am in now as well. The \nvast majority are kind- but there is someone who is either a low-\nlevel entity or isnt very evolved who leaves me the odd nasty \nstatement....\n&gt;   Every house i have lived in has been very &#39;active &#39; so I finally \ndecided to try and find out more abou them.\n&gt;   Have you been doing evps very long? do you have a haunt in your \nhouse? I will have to look and see what files you have in the group ( \nive listened to almost all of them but forget whos is whos now lol)\n&gt;   what brought you into the field of paranormal research?\n&gt;   anyway, thanks again and look forward to chatting again soon\n&gt;   cheers   :)\n&gt;   Charm\n&gt; \n&gt; Kristin Morris &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           Hi Charm!\n&gt;   \n&gt;   I&#39;ve been listening to your files and they are very intriguing.  \nAre these standard EVPs from an intelligent haunt of your own house?  \nAre you utilizing a hack or any other type of box to capture these?  \n&gt;   Kristin\n&gt;   \n&gt;       \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;   \n&gt;   From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] \n&gt; Sent: Friday, May 09, 2008 12:48 PM\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt;         \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt; File : /Charm&#39;s Toybox/D72yesmaam3_CLR.mp3 \n&gt; Uploaded by : charmedbyu20032003 &lt;charmedbyu20032003@...&gt; \n&gt; Description : This morning ( May 9-08) I asked Monique if she was \naround.
