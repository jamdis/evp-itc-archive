It&#39;s not everyone who has a life size Native American doll in their family room but its created a great atmosphere over time with all the energies although we have had some challenging times with some of the naughtier ones on the way, had to kick some spirit butt on the way to keep those out... Thanks again \n\nSteve\n \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;draiga1&quot; &lt;mail@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello Steve,\n&gt; \n&gt; I also collect haunted dolls and other objects. I don&#39;t have as many dolls as your wife does, but I do enjoy them. It&#39;s nice to have a fellow collector here.

They&#39;re not quite like that but shadows, voices, things moving, orbs, lights and stuff are everyday occurances here. I even got thrown out of bed one day a few years ago with a spirit who wanted too much attention..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
