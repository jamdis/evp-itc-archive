On occasion at night I hear someone shouting my name &quot; Mike!&quot;  But that is it. I either hear the voice with my mind or my ear. Have yet to figure that out yet. You note that you can see spirits, but can you hear them?  I often wonder if this Jon Edwards guy or George Andersen are really speaking to spirits as they seem to be fishing in a reading, and if the customer pickis up on it, the reader says, &quot;yes that is what they are tellling me&quot;.  I would think if spirits spoke to you, that you would hear them as you would hear me speaking to you.  I am new at this stufff, and have much to learn.  Any comments about the above would be helpful.
