&gt; Mr Sumption I do not know you and we have never meet so Im not sure what is going on here. The original post that started this between me and you was a copy from a post I made on my facebook page first, then other places including EVP-ITC and the other group RTSC. It has nothing to do with you, it was a statment about my work to anyone that might be interested in what I am doing and how I make my devices. I will not attack you personally however your (place polictically correct descriptive word here) comments are starting to worry me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Excuse me? I attacked no one. I simply made a statement that what I make, I am not comparing to nor am I trying to copy or steal someones ideas I make a swiss army knife box that some people may want. If no one wants them then ill end up with a pile of plastic on my shelves in my home out of sight and that will be the end of that HOWEVER if someone does want to try my imperfect equipment to see if it will work for them Then I am happy to help them out with something that they may notÂ have been able to make on there on, and mainstream factories are not producing this stuff.
