Cool I remember reading about them workin on the wireless power thing a while back but that was for a much more distant govt project and they mentioned what if it could be used to power things here closer such as phones laptops etc. By the time we see a thing its already been in creation and execution for a good amount of time tho. 
   
  I am still wondering why nobody is snatching up some of the h2o powered vehicles etcetera...yeah i get the whole oil is money thing but cant tell me theres not at least one "green" friendly corporation out there. I have seen many plans, I have seen a few running...theres a few different kinds out there in some old guys shed rotting away or in the clunker they drive. Im not technical but seems to be a simple logical process and not always rocket science. Technology would progress much further without limitations but I havent quite figured out how they draw thier lines for what is acceptable and what is not.
   
  Theres been talk of using corn instead of gasoline for too many years to count but I dont believe I ever saw them start doing it here until those two guys drove cross country in an old vehicle using french fry grease they gathered along the way at restaurants back dump areas. I figure I have spent a bit of time waitin in drive thrus imagine adding a fuel option to that. Intstead of "do you want fries with that" how about "would you like some fuel with that" Yep McD's would make a killin LOL
