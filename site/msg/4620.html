Robin,
  Glad something helped.  
  Beyond my thoughts, I totally agree that the choice of equipment is part of the ritual, and that having respect and passion for the process of choosing can actually add to the positive vibrations. Although, as previously stated, I believe with Mark Macy that the mind and heart are the most important tools in all this, how touched those on the other side must be to witness our fervent and abundant exchanges as we try to hash out the details of our equipment trials!  Surely this heightens the love on their end--and their efforts to give us the contacts we desire. Something to think about.
  Best to all,
  Ursula

          Wow, thanks for your help guys!

Ursula, your post was lovely. I've been promising myself to learn 
more about Mark Macy's work and will check out his website ASAP. 
Ritualized versus random recording makes sense to me now, as I want 
to accomplish true communication rather than continue being verbally 
abused. Have you given up "ghost hunting" altogether? 

I've been looking at the Olympus VN-4100 PC, Zack! I don't know if I 
need that much recording time, but I sure have liked the one I have 
and wouldn't mind upgrading a bit. 

Hi Frank! I basically follow your suggestion when recording, and once 
I learned to be quiet I actually started getting responses. I think 
the entities at my house got tired of playing with me though, and now 
they aren't saying anything. I kind of miss them, but I do feel it's 
time to move on.
