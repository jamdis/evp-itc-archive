personally i dont use radio boxes. at first, i have made many experiments
with radios, psychophones, scanners, microphone etc. 
but i was (and always) i am not very convinced about the results because,
for me, the possibility to listen a speech from a normal 
radio broadcast and then try to interpreting it as "paranormal" is no more
desiderable. to high is for me the risk to misunderstanding. 
 
in the new ghost-station 2 i have continued to install psychophones and
shortwave-receivers, but with another idea. 
my research tend to go more in to the ultrasound field, with audioconverters
and ultrasound receivers. 
 
in the new ghost-station 2 i habe built-in several modules to "scramble" the
speech patterns and then to convert the signal in, or  
from the ultrasound in audible sound. 
 
another module is the random-storage unit, basicly a "hardware evp maker"
like the software from stefan bion, but it is not a real 
random scrambler, but it works very nice for me :)
 
what i also made is a "laser communication line". it means, the audio
signal, no matter what type of audio signal, were modulated 
from a laser-transmitter and received on the other side by a
photo-transistor on a distance from about 16 feet.
 
some others experiments i have made with infrared. the principle is the same
like the laser communication line. i have build a 
infrared-transmitter and on the other side a infrared-receiver. the results
were weaker as with the laser, but i do not had to much
time to improve the system.
 
another ghost-station 2 project is the space-station receiver. it is a
portable unit for receiving very low frequency. basically
it consists on 2 indipendent vlf receivers (the nasa inspire receiver, and
the bbb-4 bare back bone receiver from Stephen P. McGreevy).
the 2 audio signals can be mixed together or remain alone. on the output it
has a squelch. the audio output is only active when a 
signal will be received. the audio signals will be routed from the internal
mixer to a integrated fm transmitter and the signal can be 
received on a normal radio some feet away.
the main idea is: trying to receive the hiss, clicks and other atmospheric
natural sounds and then, with specialized software
on a pc, trying to time stretch, time pitch or resampling the audiosignals.
after that, filtering the recording and then, if i can hear some
voices i had a relativ certainty that here is something "paranormal".
 
the idea is, is we "scramble" the signals, then we convert it in the
ultrasound, we filter it, and in the final results we can hear some
voices that, for example, are call us with our names, or there are
intelligible voices, we can be more sure, that there are not
radio fragments, but maybe an intelligent entity that is trying to
communicate with us.
 
with all these modules i had very interesting results, but the ghost-station
2 project is not finished yet. i hope to be finished until the end 
of this year.
 
hope i my writing has been understandable :)
 
ciao ciao salvi

what types of ITC's do you use, other then radio boxes?

thanks sf :) when i am finished the homepage and the ghost-station 2
project, i promise to translate the page in english, french and italian.
hopefully not in 100 or more years :))

sorry ursula for interfering, but i dont think, this is the right way for
discussing with matt. a bit more decency is desiderable.
matt has done very interesting considerations and i agree with his opinion. 
 
i think, we need in our research more details and these important details
can give us maybe
scientist with scientific investigations. telling that scientists are
"stupid,stepdorks, "non-belivers",etc
is not fair.
 
sorry for my bad english, but i have reading for a long time here in the
list, and now i though, it was
the moment to write my 2 cents.
 
for information: my name is salvi, ham operator since 1990 with call HB9GBY,
i am living in bern, switzerland, 
builder of the experimental-units named ghost-station. i have a homepage
www.transkommunikat <http://www.transkommunikation.ch/> ion.ch , 
not completly finished yet and at the moment only in german language.
 
best regards
 
salvi

Well Id first wish to introduce myself. My name is Matt Dowdell and im from
a small group of people who have been doing paranormal
research/investigation in the CT area. This is my first post, but i have
been lurking threw these forums for some time.

One thing i would like everyone who reads this realize is that paranormal
research/investigating, like any new science, nothing can be written in
stone.

Now i do want to say that the research into the boxes and other devices by
Frank and others can not go unnoticed, but there is still one or two flaws
in them.

I mean, with the short bit i listened to, i dont feel as if they are bashing
you or frank personally but the idea behind the boxes, but without a doubt
in a ignorant fashion.

Regardless, i personally try to stay away from the boxes, but i join this
site inorder to learn more about them and how they work. To me the boxes
have to much "chance" to may be or may not be something. I have used one in
the past and had an interesting result, but for all i know, it could have
been a rogue radio wave from a station in the area. Im just hoping to give
you an idea of this thinking is VS bashing your ideas and work, which im
simpley not. Science is about proving something from every angle and being
without a doubt its correct without anyone able to say its something else.

Unfortunetly, with the boxes, there is alot of noise and when matrixing
comes into mind, you create a situation where something is absolutly
nothing, seems to be otherwise. Im not saying they dont work, from it, again
im saying it could be a "chance".

Video, pictures are fool proof, audio really isnt, and honestly, when my
team picks up EVPs we go into them with a doubtful mind and dont depend on
them to be our evidence.

<DIV><BR><BR>Well Id first wish to introduce m=
yself. My name is Matt Dowdell and 
im from a small group of people who hav=
e been doing paranormal 
research/investigat<WBR>ion in the CT area. This i=
s my first post, but i have 
been lurking threw these forums for some time.=
<BR><BR>One thing i would like 
everyone who reads this realize is that par=
anormal research/investigat<WBR>ing, 
like any new science, nothing can be =
written in stone.<BR><BR>Now i do want to 
say that the research into the b=
oxes and other devices by Frank and others can 
not go unnoticed, but there=
 is still one or two flaws in them.<BR><BR>I mean, 
with the short bit i li=
stened to, i dont feel as if they are bashing you or 
frank personally but =
the idea behind the boxes, but without a doubt in a 
ignorant fashion.<BR><=
BR>Regardless, i personally try to stay away from the 
boxes, but i join th=
is site inorder to learn more about them and how they work. 
To me the boxe=
s have to much "chance" to may be or may not be something. I have 
used one=
 in the past and had an interesting result, but for all i know, it could 
h=
ave been a rogue radio wave from a station in the area. Im just hoping to g=
ive 
you an idea of this thinking is VS bashing your ideas and work, which =
im simpley 
not. Science is about proving something from every angle and be=
ing without a 
doubt its correct without anyone able to say its something 
=
else.<BR><BR>Unfortunetly, with the boxes, there is alot of noise and when =

matrixing comes into mind, you create a situation where something is absol=
utly 
nothing, seems to be otherwise. Im not saying they dont work, from it=
, again im 
saying it could be a "chance".<BR><BR>Video, pictures are fool =
proof, audio 
really isnt, and honestly, when my team picks up EVPs we go i=
nto them with a 
doubtful mind and dont depend on them to be our 
evidence.=
