<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>for all researchers,

THIS IS NOT FOR THE REASON OF PUSHING A PANIC BUTTON OR A MATTER OF 
GIVING IN TO FEAR. 

It is simply an incident that I feel researchers should be aware of 
as a possibility. Given in my opinion the boxes do open a portal due 
to the connection necessary for real time two way communication, and 
the wide spread belief that entities can and do manipulate physical 
objects when in the presence of them.

I have just been made aware of a situation that has happened to a 
fairly new researcher whom I believe to be honest and forthcoming.

the incident involved the aftermath of a regular RS box session. The 
researcher had finished his session with the practice of asking that 
any entities that may have traveled through the box, return and asked 
for conformation, then proceeded to end the session and turn the box 
off. he was assured that he turned the box off by going back to the 
recording after the incident and validating verbally that he did in 
fact turn off the box.

He left the room for a few moments , when he returned he allegedly  
witnessed a white cloud move across the room and noticed that his RS 
box was turned on and running.

This is actually the first instance I have encountered where the 
possibility of an entity that may have

purposely stayed behind to turn the box back on and let other 
entities through. matter of fact

that concept has not occurred to me before. but now sounds very 
possible.

This may even happen at times we are never aware of and they actually 
turn the box on and when 
whatever comes through is through they turn it off again and we are 
none the wiser.

I will definitely address this in my sessions, what I suggest is 
until we come to a mutual agreement among researchers
on this occurrence, I think it best that when we end a session we 
remove at least one battery from the box to prevent it being turned
back on.
