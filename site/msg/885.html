&gt; fooling around with thunder:
&gt; 
&gt; we&#x27;re getting those drenching t-storms with the low lightning between 
&gt; the trees , typical of jupiter passing between earth and galactic 
&gt; center so april 6 should be best evp time in awhile
&gt; 
&gt; tonite:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; heated anode gold whisker end with one match .  in live circuit tuned 
&gt; to strong local station.
&gt;  
&gt; when match was two thirds burned, white noise started. match was put 
&gt; out. 
&gt;  
&gt; now there is a steady 20mv* across input with diode in place.  
&gt; previously 0 mv.  no difference when diode is reversed..  diode 
&gt; removed, v drops to zero.  formerly strong local station was barely 
&gt; audible with good audio amp.  now it is  at normal listening volume.  
&gt; diode is noisy, but beneath what you can hear when tuned to 
&gt; station.  &quot;lumpy&quot; white noise; white noise with larger scale order 
&gt; appearing and vanishing- unpredictably , like candle flame- but 
&gt; averaging about 3-15 times per second
&gt;  
&gt; other am receivers still full of crashing static from long gone t-
&gt; storm.
&gt;  
&gt; tank circuit +diode + audio amp= no lightning crashes whatsoever.  no 
&gt; line noise. no fluorescent light 60hz buzz.

&gt; im making som noise sources as soon as i collapse for awhile by 
&gt; holding a soldering iron to either end of  1n34 diode in live 
&gt; circuit.  injection of gold from point contact into germanium block 
&gt; forms defect type dopant and microscopic p or n+ later junction which 
&gt; has low back threshold and is very noisy but low amplitude.  noise 
&gt; that issues from an infinitely smal point source seems to work better 
&gt; for some reason.   i just hold a match or soldering on there while 
&gt; listening to amplified noise till i get something that sounds good
&gt; 
&gt; * 20mv average,  larger scale prigogine fluctuations up to 75mv.  
&gt; unpredictable but not completely random--pinked up due to SOMETHING 
&gt; UNIDENTIFIED trying to cohere. amplified 3-15 per second voltage 
&gt; peaks drive sweep.  random except for voice or other coherent energy.
