I&#39;m goin got try not to control too much \nhere, hopefully spammers won&#39;t be too much of a problem, and there&#39;s \nalways the banned button! \n\n For everyone joining; Welcome to my group, an informal place to \ndiscuss EVP and related subjects. I do my e-mail from work, \nhopefully my boss won&#39;t see this! So mostly I&#39;m here during the  \nweek day, and as time permits.\n\n There is a file area where members can upload voice examples, and \neven photos, just keep in mind that storage space is limited, so \ndon&#39;t leave stuff up on a permenant basis, and make sure you create \nyour own folder, it makes it easier to keep track of your own stuff.\n\n Thanks!\n\n Frank"}
