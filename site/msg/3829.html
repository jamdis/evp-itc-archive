<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Dear Ann,

Damn, you are a determined woman! ;-)

Very well. If you must know, yes I&#x27;ve confronted darkness face to 
face. What some would call evil... calling my name. 

I was but a small child at the time, looking through crib slats. Long 
ago but never forgotten. Something I now know was a war for my soul 
took place, as much as that is odd to relate. Pleasing terror yawned 
wide, like sharp toothed jaws on one side, yet a light of infinite 
power and truth, a lighthouse within, finally sent her away, along 
with a simple decision I made, to embrace the highest and best.

That&#x27;s about as much as I wish to say, since many will not understand 
let alone believe, until such a thing is revealed to them, as it was 
to me. It is so difficult to put such forces from within and beyond 
into words, and even harder to understand.   

LOL!

Suffice it to say I am a believer.

My quest in this life is to play a small part, a singular role, like 
a tiny ripple in the vast sea.

Nothing more. Nothing less.  

Lance

&gt; But again, Lance, I am talking about personal experiences, not 
other  
&gt; people&#x27;s alleged experiences. Have you ever been injured by a  
&gt; negative entity? Or even scared shitless?

&gt; &gt; Hi Ann,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just jumping in to add my two cents. I personally don&#x27;t like to 
focus
&gt; &gt; on evil entities, even though I believe 100% that lower astrals
&gt; &gt; exist. Not only that, Tibetan shamans, among others, have 
repeatedly
&gt; &gt; shown that thought forms can be given form and a measure of life.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The way I see it, if we keep a higher focus, such things as rage,
&gt; &gt; hate, and destruction among other things will be far removed. 
Ouija
&gt; &gt; Boards have many times been the source of horrible experiences. 
Just
&gt; &gt; from listening to all the hundreds of callers on C2C over the 
years,
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;d say over 95% of the stories weren&#x27;t good.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; George did make a good statement to the effect that it&#x27;s not good
&gt; &gt; giving a loaded gun to a child.

&gt; &gt; &gt; He may very well have changed it. Maybe he&#x27;ll tell us why 
himself,
&gt; &gt; if he chooses, since he&#x27;s a list member.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Can I ask you what personal experiences you have had with evil
&gt; &gt; entities that make you so concerned? Not other people&#x27;s alledged
&gt; &gt; experiences, but your own? I&#x27;m really curious. It&#x27;s not a trap of 
any
&gt; &gt; kind.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Not misinformation. The page has been changed as of Dec 3rd!
&gt; &gt; Imagine
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that. The article did indeed state that children and high 
school
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;students would be part of the testing groups as well as 
skeptic,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;believers, etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Yes I did notice the discrepancy between the asup article and 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;disclaimers on the paranormal sytems page.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I pulled this list of general recommendations for The 
MiniBox
&gt; &gt; right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; off Ron&#x27;s www.paranormalsystems.com page -
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1. Do not allow children under the age of 16 to use this 
device
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2. Although individual sessions are effective, group 
sessions
&gt; &gt; are more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; productive.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 3. This is not an &#x27;electronic Ouija board&#x27; - no harm can 
come
&gt; &gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; using it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 4. Some voices will use coarse language so be prepared for 
it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 5. Always use a recorder to tape all sessions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 6. Keep a notebook with the times and locations of your
&gt; &gt; sessions.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 7. The MiniBox will call you by name so don&#x27;t be startled 
by
&gt; &gt; it.
