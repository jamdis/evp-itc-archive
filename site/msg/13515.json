If you look at this:\nhttp://visiblemantra.org/letters/kukai-alphabet-small.jpg\nIf I&#39;m not mistaken the first symbol you see can be found on that image at 6,3 the second at 8,1 the third at 12,5...and I couldn&#39;t find one that looked close to the 4th one. Not for sure, but I thought the relationship was strikingly similar.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Chad&quot; &lt;cawiggins78@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I did an experiment the other night using the water method. I got some pretty convincing images. I posted a few of them in my folder so check them out if you want and let me know what you think. I will send better resolution images. If you want them, send me an email. I will also make the movie file available on request. It is up at YouTube, but its boring and the quality lacks on there. Hope you enjoy and comment on the pictures.
