<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I never read that book, but if what it is implying is what I think it is... that there is no objective reality... then that is very scary to me, and hard to accept.  A pill I can swallow if I must, but would rather not until I have to... perhaps I should read that book :)

&gt; To put it very simply, the universe is the sum of the observations of
&gt; everyone in it. The Schrodinger wave equation never collapses. Schrodinger&#x27;s

&gt; &gt; I have been silent out of fear. Sometimes the ridicule gets hard to take. I
&gt; &gt; know that sometimes mind does influence perception of reality. The other day
&gt; &gt; I was brought back to quantum physics. They talk of an observer and how just
&gt; &gt; the observer being there can change things. I was thinking it is like when I
&gt; &gt; sing. I sing much better when I am alone than when I think someone can hear
&gt; &gt; me.
