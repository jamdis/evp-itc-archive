No one really knows why, but some graveyards are haunted. There are a numbe=
r of things that may contribute to a graveyard being haunted:

Alot of grav=
eyards, especially the really old ones, where built on naturally occurring =
"hallowed ground". That is places that were already considered to have stra=
nge phenomena occurring, which is why these areas were chosen in the first =
place to be a burial spot. 

Places such as Potter's Fields, where slaves, =
the poor and other disrespected people are buried. Usually the people in th=
ese places are haphazardly buried in mass pits and unmarked graves. For obv=
ious reason's, these places are notoriously haunted.

It may also be that a=
lot of  haunted cemeteries are haunted not in the way you would think. Ther=
e may not be any actual ghosts. What happens is that after so many years of=
 soo much sadness  and despair from visiting mourners, that energy tends to=
 rub off on the environment.

  I have a =
question, why is it that people are always going to grave yards, why would =
any spirit or ghost want to hang around in a place of so much sadness, when=
 they've got the whole universe to explore.  Why don't they go to some fun =
places?
