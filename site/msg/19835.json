It seems to be a normal function of our own minds(living or\n&gt; dead), the same as reverse speech. I found some faces in old EVPs from boxes\n&gt; and also in music files. The ones from Evanescence are pretty impressive in\n&gt; person, and do not seem to be intentionaly embedded.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I know, it&#39;s not ghost hunters, and most don&#39;t want to have to think.\n&gt; I think most want this stuff in a neat little box, all well defined, all\n&gt; rules and protocols known, but it just won&#39;t stay in one box, or universe\n&gt; for that matter.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;\nDear Frank,\n\nI think that I see what you mean.  I mean no offense, but I it would be helpful to see something a little more definitive that couldn&#39;t be mistaken for matrixing.  Is this possible?  Is it just me?\n\n- Adrienne"}
