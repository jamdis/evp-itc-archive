<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Misty.  I was surprised at how much smaller my files became when I changed my 
settings in Audacity to 16-bit MONO with an 11025Hz sample rate.   I figure this is voice 
we are recording, not the symphony.  And in my case, I&#x27;m not doing any kind of frequency 
analysis, or anything else that requires super high quality files.  Files, in almost all cases, 
really do not need to be 32-bit stereo with a 44100Hz sample rate.  But I know how hard 
it can be to convince some people of this.

I do save my individual raw files on my drive in WAV format.  But if I&#x27;m going to post, I 
create an MP3.  Even my WAV files are small though.  Just took a look, and with my 
settings, a short WAV file runs about 88kb.  Converted to MP3 it becomes just 16kb.  I 
have one that is 248kb in the raw, but after editing out unrelated content and exporting to 
MP3, it was just 24kb.  

If people would just record with the lower settings to begin with, I think they would be 
surprised at the amount of quality which remains... not to discount how much of their own 
hard drive space will be saved.  I know a 1MB WAV file with the high settings becomes just 
20kb in MP3 format with the lower settings.    

I visit another forum where the max file size for a single submission is 150kb.  A person is 
physically unable to upload any file larger than that.  People have changed to the lower 
settings in order to meet the file size restriction, and I can tell you that plenty of members 
post, and plenty of others hear and understand their examples just fine.  Hopefully some of 
the members here will give the lower settings a try.  :0)

&gt;   You guys really do have to start using mp3 versions tho we are at 90% full again so its 
going to come down to either some people wont be allowed to post files if they cant make 
the transition, or all files will have to be deleted, or nobody will be able to post at all 
because there will be no space left.
