He suggested Cool Edit Pro instead of the adobe given it is much easier to slow down the clip  without distorting the original voice imprint. \n   \n  In addition we discussed how the questions and answers that I was receiving in some cases where not as direct as they should be, but the lines of two-way communication continued to flow with many entities coming through at the same time chiming in with their own answers wanting to be heard.  I have several clips that mention all of you by name and would like to forward them under separate cover if I may.  \n   \n  I thank you all for your help and will continue uploading my data with trail and error as it comes, in the hopes that some of my contributions will count and help you all with your future research.\n   \n  Juli\n   \n  \n\nbhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n          Juli,\n\nyou are well on your way to becoming a fine and valuable researcher.\n\nAs a new researcher just having the guts to post your results for \ncritique is proof enough that you have what it takes.
