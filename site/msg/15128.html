<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>There was a smaller Schematic Frank posted about using the tuner from a radioshack 469.  It was a smaller diagram just showing where to plug your signal into the vt, and to provide the 3v into the tuner. Sorry im not more specific, im a newbie to circuits.

Frank emailed me back and said for a random sweep he no longer likes using the white noise generator, and instead prefers to use a dual supply op amp.  Im not entirely sure what a op amp is or how to use it.  Im assuming it produces a random signal that can be used for the VT.  BUt I need to do alot more research to learn what it really does.

&gt; Which schematic are you using?

&gt; 
&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for having me apart of your yahoo group. Ive been researching this a lot and was overly excited to find a group that actually has frank posting in it.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m about to attempt to make my first box ( well i have made the ufogeek radio shack hack, but that was too easy). I plan to try and make the one with a random voltage generator that&#x27;s plugged into the Radio Shack 499, and if I can do that successfully, out to an echo-box before heading out.
&gt; 
&gt; My question to you all is if you could point me in the right direction to get up to speed enough on circuits and electronics via a website or book. I have no experience doing this kind of stuff. But im a quick learner and really want to make this happen.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the help everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; God Bless and Good Results to you all.
&gt; 
&gt; David
