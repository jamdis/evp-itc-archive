<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Here is what I sent TRU TV .. I suggest you ask them also.
Where did the TV advertisers get the term SKEPTIC-TURNED-BELIEVER when
describing Alison Smith and why did they change it to Professional Skeptic
(Whatever that is) after people saw it as some kind of scam, since she is a
member of the JREF MDC? Bottom line ... Who was responsible for posting that
on the internet site? Was the program misinformed? If so, by whom? Thanks
for your cooperation in this matter.

&gt;
&gt; I realized that you might want to see the other pages of this chapter.
&gt;
&gt; Some of them are a little fuzzy,again because of the age of the book, it
&gt; was difficult to get some of the pages flat.
&gt;
&gt; I could still read them so you guys should be able to.
&gt;
&gt; You might have to download them so you can rotate the image though.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ll uploaded those pages later.

&gt;  Thanks Don! Though I expect the quality would be better with the
&gt; scanner, I am able to read what you uploaded after zooming in a couple
&gt; times, and with no other processing of the jpg. So I think if you go
&gt; this route, it would work.

&gt; &gt; Rather than risk the scanner and the bending required, I thought
&gt; about using my camera.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I tried taking a single page at a time but even in Macro mode, the
&gt; type was out of focus.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So I just uploaded 4 pages (2 pages per image) of my first attempt
&gt; with the camera.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I wanted to know if it was good enough.  If so, I&#x27;ll redo those and
&gt; the remaining pages with brighter light and keeping my thumb out of
&gt; the picture :))
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If if it not good enough then I&#x27;ll try the scanner.  Although I was
&gt; able to read them just fine so it should be good enough.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Let me know,

&gt; &gt; Yeah Don you can upload them in the photo section as
&gt; jpg&#x27;s hardly any space taken up there (the file section is the one
&gt; thats always full) and if it sets our limit over then I am sure we can
&gt; post it other places as well like esnips.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I found the book.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It is called &quot;The Diary and Sundry Observations of Thomas Alva
&gt; Edison&quot;  the copyright for the edition I have is 1948.  Since only a
&gt; limited number of 1st printings have Chapter 8, &quot;The Realms Beyond&quot;,
&gt; then I suspect 1948 would be the date of the first printing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Each chapter ends with the year Mr. Edison wrote it (it is primarily
&gt; his diary).  The part about spirit communication is dated 1922.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Obviously a 61 year old book is a bit fragile so I&#x27;ll start trying
&gt; to scan those pages but I&#x27;m not going to hurt the book for it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I suppose I just post them as JPGs in an email?  There is not a
&gt; place to upload files here is there?  Well I know there is but I
&gt; thought we were not supposed to use it.

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the link! Very interesting. I went to Edison&#x27;s place down
&gt; here in Florida in search of any information on the subject.
&gt; &gt; I found nothing. It was rumored that the executors of the estate had
&gt; anything of the sort removed.
&gt; &gt; I lost both my grandad and an uncle last month. People change their
&gt; minds about the afterlife. I&#x27;ve seen it first hand!
&gt; &gt; How old was Edison when this article was written?
&gt; &gt; Thanks

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have one of a handful of the Edison Autobiography that has the
&gt; last chapter with his thoughts on the great beyond.  His family had
&gt; that version of the biography recalled and reissued it without the
&gt; last chapter.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway in this last chapter, Edison alludes to a way to communicate
&gt; with the dead but he never says he did it.  He simply hypothesizes on
&gt; how it could be done and the fact that the dead are just on a
&gt; different wavelength than the living.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sorry, no links...  This is from that old fashioned thing called a
&gt; book :))
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I can tell you how to find your own copy though if you wish.  I need
&gt; to find the actual page count from my copy but I went to amazon&#x27;s used
&gt; books and asked every seller how many pages their copy was.  The first
&gt; one to respond with the correct (bigger) number, that was the one I
&gt; bought.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Don
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; PS but don&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; spend alot.  The info in the last chapter is not worth much.

&gt; &gt; I suppose ultimately, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if Edison made a
&gt; &gt; telephone to the dead or not. Modern researchers in this field will
&gt; &gt; have to stand on their own results anyway, and if they&#x27;ve managed to
&gt; &gt; discover something that Edison never achieved, good for them!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have also heard varied claims: that Edison did make this box; that
&gt; &gt; Edison was working on it but never finished it; that Edison was joking
&gt; &gt; when he mentioned working on it. So for my own sake, I&#x27;d like to know
&gt; &gt; the real story.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you have a link to where you got your information from his
&gt; &gt; assistants and staff, I would really like to read it. Please make
&gt; &gt; sure it is as close to the source material as possible, and not
&gt; &gt; someone quoting someone quoting an article. For example, here is a
&gt; &gt; link to the actual New York times article on Edison discussing his
&gt; &gt; views of life after death:

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That is the kind of link I&#x27;d be hoping for regarding your statements.
