The sweep design remains pretty much unchanged. We were =
talking about
making boards in the past, you quit answering e-mails on the =
subject.

Besides, there's other considerations, such as, some claim demons=
 and
evil spirits come out of, or get attached to the boxes, I don't want t=
o
be put in a position where some of these users make me responsible for
th=
ier own suggestions of negativity. Then there's problems of support, I
thin=
k it would be a nightmare. There's alot of loony tunes attacted to
this fie=
ld. I've had a number of people that want to be able call
anytime, and the =
few I have allowed results in endless hours of being
tied up on the phone. =
