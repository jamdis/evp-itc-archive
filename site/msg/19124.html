<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I can see how it is a portability issue.  I used to work at a recording
studio that had 4 reverb plates from the 1950&#x27;s.  They were so big that they
had to be hung in a semi trailer.  All audio outboard reverb&#x27;s available
today function on the same principle as your echo chamber, but the use solid
state circuitry and chips to accomplish the task.

Is it possible to include an echo chamber section that is separate from the
internal component section of your box?  A box connected to your box but is
separated by thick wood?  This may cut down on your problem of portability,
but may not entirely get rid of the problem because waves are so large that
they conduct through wood (put your ear to the back of an electric guitar or
bass and strum it, you will still hear a little).  If you attached your
chamber to the box, had it separated by solid wood, and gave it ventilation
slits, you might not have this problem anymore.

The demonic sound is not surprising.  Most commercial reverbs allow for
pre-delay (the sound and then the reverb) in milliseconds, and decay (how
long the sound lasts after).  Your echo chambers don&#x27;t have this so if you
build it on a big board, it is like the reverb is equivalent to yelling in a
concert hall versus if your echo chamber was built on a smaller board it
would sound like yelling in a bathroom.  The safe effect, only the result is
curtailed.

The original reverb plates which are kind of like your current echo chamber
were built in a wooden box that had limited width but were significant in
length and height.  Inside of the box were two metal plates.  The sound was
fed into the box and the amount of reverb was controlled by turning a wheel
that moved the plates closer to each other or farther apart, and this
controlled the amount of the reverb.

Your boxes will always sound better with reverb, it is like singing in the
shower.  Because of the reverberation the voice sounds fuller.

&gt;  Feedback is the big problem with the internal echo chamber. For a while I
&gt; was leaving out the echo chamber, but trying to provide external chambers
&gt; was a problem too, it makes the box less portable. The chamber adds
&gt; &quot;something&quot;, kinda like a filter, plus &quot;they&quot; seems to be able to make their
&gt; voices easier. Usually I can drill holes in the cabinet to relive the
&gt; feedback, with this box I had to seal the whole thing with silicone. I had a
&gt; better seal between the battery compartment and the main compartment, so I
&gt; guess sound was finding other ways to interact.
&gt;
&gt;  The chamber speaker is less than an inch in diameter, and the mic just a
&gt; standard electret.  I use three tubes, instead of the two shown in the
&gt; diagram so I can get more separation. The larger the chamber the more
&gt; pronounced the enhancement effect, the voices are almost scary. I made one
&gt; once that was 12 inch by 48 inch MDF board lined with aluminum foil with
&gt; crystals and magnets glued on the insides, OMG  I had to take to it apart!
&gt; That was frikkin&#x27; demonic.
&gt;
&gt;  That&#x27;s one reason I don&#x27;t have a fixed design, there&#x27;s just too much to
&gt; this.

&gt;&gt; It is a simple concept as to why the vents cut down on feedback.  As a
&gt;&gt; former live sound engineer, feedback was quite the nemesis.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If I remember reading right, you have a small microphone and a small
&gt;&gt; speaker in your &quot;echo chamber.&quot;  A feedback loop happens when a speaker
&gt;&gt; produces audio and a microphone pics that audio up.  The thing is, if the
&gt;&gt; speaker and microphone are not far enough apart from one another, a feedback
&gt;&gt; loop occurs where the audio loop between microphone to speaker keeps
&gt;&gt; building up and frequencies start to converge into feedback.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Considering that your echo chamber is right under the batteries, the
&gt;&gt; microphone in the echo chamber is probably picking up the audio from the
&gt;&gt; main speaker output at the same time as the output that is in the echo
&gt;&gt; chamber.  The two sources picked up at the same time is causing the
&gt;&gt; feedback.   By venting the battery chamber, the soundwaves from the main
&gt;&gt; speaker  are being released easier from the hollow design of the box.  This
&gt;&gt; allows for the natural reverberation caused by speaker output to stop
&gt;&gt; reverberating around inside the box, it is this bouncing around of audio
&gt;&gt; that is= eventually picked up by your echo chamber microphone at the same
&gt;&gt; time and becomes feedback.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The same thing happens during a concert when a performer gets his
&gt;&gt; microphone to close to the floor monitor.  A feedback loop occurs because
&gt;&gt; the singer hear&#x27;s his voice in the floor monitor at the same time as it is
&gt;&gt; coming out of his mouth.  A loop occurs where the frequencies build upon
&gt;&gt; each other and feedback happens.  In your case, the microphone inside the
&gt;&gt; echo chamber is simply picking up the main speaker at the same time as the
&gt;&gt; speaker in your echo box, causing the same audio pattern.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hope this helps,
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; The battery box is on top of the echo chamber, and venting the door helps
&gt;&gt;&gt; cut the feedback for some weird acoustical reason. The new box should be
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;92&quot; doh!

  Feedback is he big p oblem wi h  he in e nal echo chambe . Fo a while I was lea ing ou he echo chambe , bu ying o p o ide ex e nal chambe s was a p oblem oo, i makes he box less po able.

Usually I can d ill holes in he cabine o eli e he eedback, wi h his box I had o seal he whole hing wi h silicone. I had a be e seal be ween he ba e y compa men and he main compa men , so I guess sound was inding o he ways o in e ac . 


 
 The chambe speake is less han an inch in diame e , and he mic jus a s anda d elec e .  I use h ee ubes, ins ead o he wo shown in he diag am so I can ge mo e sepa a ion.

I is a simple concep as o why he en s cu down on eedback.  As a o me li e sound enginee , eedback was qui e he nemesis.   

I I emembe eading igh , you ha e a small mic ophone and a small speake in you &quot;echo chambe .&quot;  A eedback loop happens when a speake p oduces audio and a mic ophone pics ha audio up.  The hing is, i he speake and mic ophone a e no a enough apa om one ano he , a eedback loop occu s whe e he audio loop be ween mic ophone o speake keeps building up and equencies s a o con e ge in o eedback.  



Conside ing ha you echo chambe is igh unde he ba e ies, he mic ophone in he echo chambe is p obably picking up he audio om he main speake ou pu a he same ime as he ou pu ha is in he echo chambe .  The wo sou ces picked up a he same ime is causing he eedback.   By en ing he ba e y chambe , he soundwa es om he main speake  a e being eleased easie om he hollow design o he box.  This allows o he na u al e e be a ion caused by speake ou pu o s op e e be a ing a ound inside he box, i is his bouncing a ound o audio ha is= e en ually picked up by you echo chambe mic ophone a he same ime and becomes eedback.



The same hing happens du ing a conce when a pe o me ge s his mic ophone o close o he loo moni o .  A eedback loop occu s because he singe hea &#x27;s his oice in he loo moni o a he same ime as i is coming ou o his mou h.  A loop occu s whe e he equencies build upon each o he and eedback happens.  In you case, he mic ophone inside he echo chambe is simply picking up he main speake a he same ime as he speake in you echo box, causing he same audio pa e n.



Hope his helps,
