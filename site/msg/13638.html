   Frank, I think you are right in that the reason for the negativity and s=
ensationalism in these shows is that it sells better.  Most people watch th=
ese shows for the escape and entertainment value, like the rest of tv.   An=
d these shows learn over time what loses audience (same old claims, boring =
results, etc), and what draws them back (wild claims, overall freak value, =
and "we must protect the children!").  This is all completely orthodox for =
tv entertainment, but does lend itself to any kind of true research, or any=
 kind of actual edification.

        So I think we can expect these shows =
will continue to ramp these sorts of elements up in order to compete, and w=
e can expect them to dwell less on mundane and activity-free situations, an=
d present more claims of evil entities, mysterious injuries, and unexplaina=
ble foul odors, accompanied by more frightened investigators, trembling sen=
sitives, and humorously gullible associates and customers, and all wrapped =
in fancier technology, scarier settings, and state-o-the-art editing.

   Thanks Rick! You seem to have put alot of thought and time into that. 

=
           What really bothers me is the self proclaimed experts out there =
that take all evidence and experience and try to make it negative, and evil=
. Maybe many get tired, or even affraid of seeking paranormal experience fo=
r that reason.

           I don't do ghost hunts or invesitgations, but th=
e hauntings I've heard of seem to be nothing more than something trying to =
get someone's attention. It's these experts that turn it into something tha=
t must be negative.  There's Hollywood, such as the "Haunting In CT", these=
 same experts will proclaim is based on fact, when the facts are probably n=
othing more than your creaking floors, just to make the whole paranoramal f=
ield dark and demon filled. In my case, fear does not sell, I won' watch th=
ose movies. 

           I think there is good EVP evidence, and I've heard=
 many from various researchers.  Trouble is, it's like talking on a phone o=
r radio, how do you know who it is other by what they say?

          That is an interesting observation. I think the core of the issue=
 is that there seems to be a `sweet spot' in paranormal beliefs where there=
 is just enough science, just enough technical backing, just enough paranor=
mal claims, and just enough indefinite evidence that keeps people intereste=
d in the ghost hunting mentality

            Evidence which becomes too in=
definite turns off most people. As they become more aware of sensitives who=
 simply make claims ("I feel there is a GHOST here!"), but provide no evide=
nce other than statements, people eventually get bored. Similarly, people e=
ventually grow tired of the anthropomorphism of every little occurrence in =
a house: a creak implies a footstep, which implies a person, which, if not =
seen, implies a ghost. But a creak does not equal a footstep.

            =
And while this kind of indefinite evidence can lose an audience, so can evi=
dence that is claimed to be "obviously" evident by technology. Here, the in=
vestigator is no longer making vague claims, but waving science around, lik=
e FLIR cameras, or EMF meters, and then making proclamations of the results=
. But again, people eventually see these are just lights and sounds from el=
ectronics, and investigators making more claims. It's like the psychics aga=
in, but with visual aids.

            I think the reason EVP studies are n=
ot securing more interest, as you noted, are a little of both effects. Firs=
t is the anthropomorphism problem: I notice many EVP experimenters proclaim=
 what their results sound like, or name the sound file by what they've hear=
d. But like the creaks, "sounds like" does not equal "is". This is then com=
pounded by the technology backing: regardless of how valid the EVP research=
er's results are, the technology can seem intimidating, but the researchers=
 often proclaim the obviousness of their results. People again become turne=
d off by it because it is not obvious to them, and in the end it is just an=
other piece of technology presenting sounds, with no obvious connection to =
the paranormal, except by the claims and interpretations of the presenters.=


            I believe, taking these issues into account, there is a way f=
or EVP studies to garner more interest. For now, the analysis coming from t=
he researchers usually seems like a claim, and it is these claims, imho, th=
at is being classified by the public with the rest of the paranormal claims=
, and so, it also becomes less of an interest. A new approach could be one =
without the claims and interpretations of the investigators, one where the =
sounds are simply played and not labeled. The interpretation of the data co=
uld be left to the listeners. Web sites which present EVPs could be develop=

ir own. I think this would be such a novel approach, that it would give the=
