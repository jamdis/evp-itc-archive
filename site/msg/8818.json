Well, obviously your spirits want you to talk to them! :)\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n\n&gt; Yeah, it sounds like a box--dah! However the background noise and\n&gt; static is less---and FM is very good. This is the best FM box I&#39;ve\n&gt; ever had. I added the mic amp and switch jack so it can be used\n&gt; direct, or with echo chamber last night and this morning. The speaker\n&gt; is old, from an Army Jeep, I scavenged it while in Germany back in the\n&gt; 70s, I used it for an external CB antenna, then on portable ham rigs,\n&gt; then in early echo boxes. The green board is the 12-469.\n \n \n \n&gt;  FRank-S"}
