So you are saying this is what you heard!?
 
 BTW, I dumped the Speakjet g=
roup, the owner broke out all scientific/mean spirited so politely told him=
 to bite me!
 
 The voice from the chips is a result of it being randomly a=
ccessed, so it changes modes, voices, speed and sound. The "ready" it keeps=
 repeating is from it apparently getting a software reset sequence. I think=
 "they" might use it and incorporate it though. The Speakjet group owner co=
uld not handle, or conceive of the possiblity, so he got all irrate.
