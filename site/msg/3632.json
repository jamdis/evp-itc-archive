The other, and \nmore likely is someone might loose money, so going to extreme \nmeasures.  I don&#39;t sell my boxes, so they are relatively rare, and \nhave little, but controlable  impact, but the inexpensive radios are \neasily obtainable, and you don&#39;t need a guru to tell what you are \nreally hearing. There&#39;s more than one party out there that stands to \nloose much if the current paranormal theories, and fear crap is \ndisproven, so don&#39;t get the idea I&#39;m talking aobut one person.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  The informatin is out there, the site contents copied by many. \nMaking threats over the internet to control people is federal crime, \nand the FBI has a site for reproting this.
