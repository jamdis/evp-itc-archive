<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi All;

 Tried to send a reply via e-mail, but guess it didn&#x27;t go through. 
People over estimate these groups, and their importance to the world. 
I started this group to share what I get, to show there is something 
out there that wants to communicate, and hopefully help others that 
maybe interested. I don&#x27;t have much use for ego maniacs that think 
their groups, or what ever are so important, and so profound that no 
one dare question anything. 

 I don&#x27;t care if anyone thinks what I do is fake. Even if it&#x27;s fake, 
how come no one has yet to duplicate it? I think they are just jealous 
cuz the only voices they get are in their heads, (as in Schizophrenic).
So far, no one tries to make the circuits as described, they claim to 
try the method, but not what I made, then claim it doesn&#x27;t work, one 
guy even claimed he was building it with vacuum tubes! Well, dah, I 
wonder why it doen&#x27;t work. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised that for every five 
doing real EVP work, there&#x27;s 20 trying to debunk it. 

 I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more than one here with affiliations with other 
groups, who cares! The internet is a big place. 

 I think they were hoping I would follow a previoyus pattern of 
getting pissed off, then quit the group, not gonna happen! I try to 
learn from my mistakes. 

 The group is still open to anyone, it seems like the nut cases ban 
them selves! LOL!
