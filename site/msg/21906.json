Both names are not\nnames I was familiar with, nor would I have pulled them out of the air\nmyself. Both names were unheard of to every member of the group present. And\nboth names, after a somewhat extensive search of the history of the sites,\nturned out to be real names of real people who had lived or died in those\nlocations in the past.\n\nHow would you explain that?
