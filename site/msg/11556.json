I can&#39;t make it on Saturday, since I have to work, but I&#39;m thinking about going on Sunday. If you go to the site it has a live feed (which I plan to watch at work)and its venue, etc. There&#39;s going to be all kinds of different stuff, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth the money. I think it&#39;d be interesting to go though.&quot;\n \n-Aaron"}
