I had an evp which states &quot;aliens assist us&quot; I am attaching that one to this post. For those who dont see it you can visit my sweep tuning folder on esnips.\n\nI recently saw one of Ed Grimsley&#39;s video postings. He uses 3rd or 4th generation nightvision to view whats going on in our sky. I think many people wont be able to digest what it all means but for those of you who can:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrO8055LQGs\n\nhttp://www.esnips.com/web/SweepTuningEVP\n\nAs I said many times not all entities/spirits who speak claim to have been born, or even human in nature. I find it all of interest to me because personally I have seen and heard quite a few things which people dont want to believe.\n\nMisty Dawn\n\n\n      \r\n--0-609271349-1222014756=:99455\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;091908ST_CLR-aliens-assist-us.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;091908ST_CLR-aliens-assist-us.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--0-609271349-1222014756=:99455--"}
