I hear do &quot;back off&quot;.\nexample of just radio chatter scanning, to me. would you submit as evidence?&quot;\n\nThe one where we asked about how to get thru the steel bars and wood and we get the &quot;Take ur file&quot; as a response, my team member who isn&#39;t buying any of this replys:\n&quot;I slowed end down sounds like &quot;take your final&quot; or &quot;findings could be talking college radio, who knows, its radio frequencies&quot;\n\nby the way after i slowed the same file down i noticed it comes thru between 6-8 different clicks on 12-469 radio on the am channel.  AS we all know that would equal about 6-8 different channels.  what is the chances of getting an understandable phrase in the same tone of voice across that many channels... i should pose that response back to him and see what his de-bunking result would be?\n\n\nI guess he&#39;s intitled to his own opinion, i am just gonna ignore his responses and keep doing what i am doing.  Thanks for the support and knowledge!\n\nKeep the comments coming"}
