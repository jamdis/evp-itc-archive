<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think you may be the one mishearing, my friend.

I say to you clearly, now, that Chris Moon is free to do whatever the  
heck he wants with his box, but he is not free to try to dissuade us  
from experimenting, too. I have formed an opinion that he is inclined  
to control the message by reading his own words and hearing his own  
words on the radio and on tapes of his sessions, and I cannot  
logically interpret them in any other way. Since you don&#x27;t agree, If  
you would like to directly quote him to prove otherwise, then I am  
always ready to modify my opinions. Truly. But I am not going to  
change my mind without evidence.

I don&#x27;t pull my opinions out of a void. I have seen what are, at this  
point, *generations* of paranormal researchers try to control the  
message and the process by saying that only the Special get to be  
part of the circle or the gang or the team or the bridge, or  
whatever. I have seen every single one of these units explode or  
implode or turn into a nascent religion over the control issues of a  
dominant person. I do not like this messianic behavior because it has  
ruined what was otherwise a potentially profitable avenue of  
research. Because I don&#x27;t talk about my own history or abilities  
often, and because I don&#x27;t yet have a box, that does not mean that I  
am not a hoary old raven with a hell of a lot of perspective on this.  
I&#x27;ve watched it happen again and again and again--thank goodness,  
mostly from a distance.

&gt; &gt; No, Chris is allowed to say he is talking to Barney for all I care.
&gt; &gt; What I hear him doing is telling others that he knows better than
&gt; &gt; they do. He does not. Period.

&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, Chris was asked to take the box and was told  
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;they&quot; wanted him to have it. I don&#x27;t think &quot;they&quot; said to have  
&gt; him
&gt; &gt; &gt; take it on loan like a library book.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; And just so I understand correctly... Everyone but Chris is  
&gt; allowed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; state his opinions. Is that right?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I for one appreciate the openness and the willingness of this
&gt; &gt; &gt; group of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people to open up the technology to anyone and everyone  
&gt; willing to
&gt; &gt; &gt; put in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time and effort that is so blatantly needed. I don&#x27;t know
&gt; &gt; &gt; Chris Moon
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I have heard him on C2C and have read his opinions. I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; always weary
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of anyone claiming to be one of a &quot;chosen few&quot; and using  
&gt; fear to
&gt; &gt; &gt; further
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their arguments.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The fear-based reasoning&#x27;s and omni-potent subterfuge  
&gt; employed by
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mr. Moon
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only tells me to ignore him and anyone else like him. There  
&gt; is no
&gt; &gt; &gt; manual or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; class – this research is done by Joe-Schmo in his basement and
&gt; &gt; &gt; therefore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open to many different interpretations and methodologies. Take
&gt; &gt; &gt; the good –
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; delete the bad. I believe in Karma – even if she is only my  
&gt; dog
&gt; &gt; &gt; digging in

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi All;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, the thing, the equiment I make, and experiment with  
&gt; as a
&gt; &gt; &gt; device for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ITC, Instrumental Trans-Communication, also now know as  
&gt; Franks&#x27;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Box, or the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ghost box (that&#x27;s also an audio devioce,a nd photography  
&gt; device)
&gt; &gt; &gt; was never
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; described by me, it&#x27;s inverntor, as the &quot;Telephone to the  
&gt; Dead&quot;,
&gt; &gt; &gt; that label
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was put on my equipment, loaned to Moon for testing, he was  
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; first to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; want to test the box, he is not, and was not designated by me
&gt; &gt; &gt; as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;primary tester&quot;. In fact he has yet to pay anything for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes he has,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or any of the other equipment he &quot;barrowed&quot;, such as the Sony
&gt; &gt; &gt; pocket size
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cassette recorder, and Tarot CD, he still has. Moon is the one
&gt; &gt; &gt; that claims
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only he, or a designated trainee can properly interpret the  
&gt; output
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box, despite the fact that I have stated numerous times that I
&gt; &gt; &gt; made the box
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for anyone to use, and one&#x27;s results are any no better or
&gt; &gt; &gt; supercede in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyway the results of anyone else.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now when someone claims that these new system don&#x27;t work,  
&gt; or only
&gt; &gt; &gt; get the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evil spirits, and even open portals so demons, or what not can
&gt; &gt; &gt; enter, they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are lying, and attempting to keep the use of any equipment,  
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; methods of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirit communication for themselves. The motive being  
&gt; priofit,a s
&gt; &gt; &gt; far as I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can tell. The portal thing is Hollywood! I use my equimpemt  
&gt; in my
&gt; &gt; &gt; basement,.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and have sinece 2000, amnd have never expereinced anything  
&gt; I could
&gt; &gt; &gt; call evil
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beside soem cussing, nakme calling voices, which is hardly
&gt; &gt; &gt; threatening
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except to maybe 13 year old girl.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I must point put, because of preivisou threats, that  
&gt; slander is
&gt; &gt; &gt; stating
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something in public about a person that is knowingly  
&gt; untrue. So
&gt; &gt; &gt; for anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comptemplating such threats I can say only-- Bring It, I  
&gt; will have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything you own!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Frank, Perhaps you can talk to an attorney to sue Chris for  
&gt; using
&gt; &gt; &gt; his &#x27;Borrowed&quot; &amp; on &quot;Loan&quot; Frank&#x27;s Box (&amp; Tarot CD) of YOURS  
&gt; (you own
&gt; &gt; &gt; it still) and refuses to return it to you (once you send him a  
&gt; letter
&gt; &gt; &gt; to return YOUR property back &amp; to stop spreading lies about it  
&gt; to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Public)???? Put him &quot;out of business&quot; in making money/profits from
&gt; &gt; &gt; YOUR box! This seem unethical in what he&#x27;s now doing, don&#x27;t ya  
&gt; think?
