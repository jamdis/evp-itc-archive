Well I don't have PDF capabilities.=A0 Besides PDFing a document usually i=
nvolves OCR and even at 99.9% accurate, there are problems.

On the photoco=
py.=A0 If I felt I could scan the pages without damaging the book then I wo=
uld (I'll try that next) but the reason I went with camera was because it i=
s a 61 year old book and I'd rather not damage the spine.

Assuming my daug=
hter is not on the computer with the scanner, then I'll try some of those.

I suspect they are going to be the same though.

I found the bo=
ok.

It is called "The Diary and Sundry Observations of Thomas Alva Edison"=
=A0 the copyright for the edition I have is 1948.=A0 Since only a limited n=

1948 would be the date of the first printing.

Each chapter ends with the y=

Obviously a 61 year old book is a bit frag=

I suppose ultimately, it doesn't really matter if =
Edison made a
telephone to the dead or not. Modern researchers in this fiel=

have to stand on their own results anyway, and if they've managed to=

discover something that Edison never achieved, good for them!

I have also=

Edison was workin=
g on it but never finished it; that Edison was joking
when he mentioned wor=
king on it. So for my own sake, I'd like to know
the real story.

If you ha=
ve a link to where you got your information from his
assistants and staff, =
I would really like to read it. Please make
sure it is as close to the sour=
ce material as possible, and not
someone quoting someone quoting an article=

/archive- free/pdf? _r=3D1&res=3D 9903EEDC1F39E333 A25751C0A9669D94 6196D6C=

That is the kind of link I'd be hoping for regarding your statements.
