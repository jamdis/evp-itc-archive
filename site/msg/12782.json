These were captured using a recorder, same as we do \ndoing a regular EVP session.  Please let me know what you think.  All \nof the files on this page came from the same session.\n\nIt is truly amazing and a bit disturbing.  The EVP&#39;s captured corelate \ndirectly to the case.  There is no doubt in my mind that this was an \nintelligent being giving intelligent answers. \n\nThis case also involves at least two women that disappeared in 1990. \nThank you so much Frank.  We may really be able to help someone here.\n\nhttp://www.esnips.com/webfolder/ccf5d532-0f1d-4e62-9a33-f353937a5377\n\n\nSuzanne May \nDirector\nMMPS"}
