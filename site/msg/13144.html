<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Richard, Misty, and all other fellow researchers,

This is a fasinating topic, one that I am currently most interested 
with as my latest experiment/research project is all about.
The crash debris that was sent to 8 researchers, I believe, does hold 
imprints from a violent past.
As does the area where the original crash happened, since there are 
still amounts of debris scattered around the immediate area, as well 
as beneath the surface where now stands a memorial.  Not to mention 
it is the last place where living humans were quickly lost.  Just 
imagine the amount of energy that must be imprinted on that exact 
spot.

That is where I hoped to gain a better understanding of that energy 
which is imprinted... and I must say, I think I have done just that.

Today I processed a number of the files I captured from the impact 
point using numerous devices of the non-microphone type.  After I put 
each of these files through a four step process (which I&#x27;ll explain 
in great detail in my video), I was able to listen to some amazing, 
and very relivent sounds.
My wife was so upset after I told her what I had heard, she refused 
to listen to the audio.

Let me just say... the combination I used was able to capture a very 
chilling scene.  One I just have to believe were the last moments of 
those who perished.

Once I publish the final results, I hope others will be able to 
verify what I am hearing...

I&#x27;m figuring to put a multi-part video on my Youtube page.  One part 
explaining what will be seen an heard, as well as describing the 
events of that day.  Another part with my sessions at the various 
locations, using various methods.  And a final part with the audio of 
the researchers who assisted with this experiment using the debris I 
sent each of them.

Bottom line... I really do believe that energy is imprinted in 
objects, and at locations where energy was strong at a time of 
imprint.

Happy Holidays to all.... have a safe and fun Holiday Season!

&gt; Richard,
&gt; 
&gt; Thats a great example and a good way to look at things. the old 
idea 
&gt; that energy doesnt die its just transformed holds true with that 
too. 
&gt; I have seen the same thing done with missing appendages, tho a 
finger 
&gt; may have been removed it still registers under kirlian photography 
as 
&gt; its energy being present.
&gt; 
&gt; Just because we dont see something or hear a thing doesnt mean it 
is 
&gt; nonexistant =) Perhaps it just means we are deaf and blind to its 
&gt; existence.

&gt; &gt; Thanks for replying to my message.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Years ago I watched a slide show featuring several photo&#x27;s taken 
via
&gt; &gt; kirlian photography. It seems kirlian photography captures certain
&gt; &gt; types of energy on film. In the demonstration a picture of a 
house 
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; shown. Later that same house had a fire and part of the house had 
&gt; been
&gt; &gt; burned to the ground but the photo taken with kirlian photography
&gt; &gt; later showed that part of the house still there.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m no expert but maybe energy we can&#x27;t see leaves an imprint in 
the
&gt; &gt; non physical universe and can be viewed or demonstrated using the
&gt; &gt; right instruments and technique. Of course I really have no clue 
and
&gt; &gt; am fascinated by the evp and itc phenomena.
