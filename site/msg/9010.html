          Hi Rees. I only partially agree with that sentiment. If we are talking about people with a 
reasonable degree of critical thinking and mental stability, then you have my full buy-in 
on that concept. 

However, it's my opinion there are *plenty* of people out there who should never touch a 
box of any flavor with a 10-foot pole, and having people who are mentally and/or 
emotionally unstable and who lack critical thinking, just mucks up the works and makes 
the rest of us look bad. 

ie: People who believe and promote the idea that a "murderous reptilian race" is 
communicating through the DR60. Yeah, you know... I really don't want to be put in the 
same category with them, just because I own a DR60. But rest assured, I got an email one 
time from someone assuming that of me, letting me know that she was a believer too! 
OMG!!!!!
