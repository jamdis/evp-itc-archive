<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Can anyone tell what would be the best way to transfer a session I 
recorded on an older microcassette recorder to my computer? 

I did my first recorded session last night. All went great except for 
the lousy reception. I didn&#x27;t realize just how much you miss during a 
real time session when you play back what you recorded. 

I got two different Steve&#x27;s one sounded Australian and a Mike. I also 
got the number &quot;Seven&quot; I am sure there is lots more there but my 
reception was so bad I can&#x27;t hear everything.

Also what would be a good digital recorder (relatively cheap) to get 
that you can easily transfer to your computer?

Any help would be appreciated.
