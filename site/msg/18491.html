Just because I do not get the results you get, is not me calling you a frau=

Why do you believe it is?

Care to quote where I said that?

What have I said or done for you to attack me like thi=

<div> Same old thing, heard them =
talking about "it hits the earth" again last night while testing one of tho=
se single supply dual sweep boxes, so set up a hack radio I had handy. "--B=
ehindTheSun--ComesFarFromEarth--(jack-frag)IsComin'--Session-EarthWillThenC=
ollide-ItEnds--Comet-Good(?)". The jack thing is Jack FM, 105.5 FM a rock s=
tation. Presumable 2012. The December 21st date from the Mayans seems =
to be a middle number, there's like a window right around Christmas, as the=
y seem to mention the 17th along with this stuff. Who knows if it means any=
thing, but what I don't like are those that profess to "know better". </div=
