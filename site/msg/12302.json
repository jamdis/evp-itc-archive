I had some success using DC6 Live Forensics and real-time monitoring with \nheadphones, using no background at all, as well as using radio sweep.  But as you \nmentioned, the filters that worked well one session often did not work the next.  Go \nfigure! ;-)\n\nThe demo of version 6 Forensics was cool because it worked for only 1 minute at a time \nbut never expired.  The demo of version 7 Forensics is a full working version, without time \nrestrictions, but after 30 days, it no longer works.  \n\nI used the setup a little differently in that I didn&#39;t use DC to record my sessions.  I used a \nsecond computer and a splitter line for the sound so when the 1 minute time limit hit, I \ndidn&#39;t have to stop the session, just rehit the play button so there was only a second or so \ngap between each minute.  As I recall my setup looked like this:\n\nExternal mic to PC sound in\nSplit line from PC sound out going to A) Mac laptop sound in & B) my headphones\n\nLooking back through my notes, I had some pretty good results with the following \nsettings:\n\nContinuous Noise First\n* Attack 10\n* Release 364\n* Attenuation 31\n* CNF Forensic\n* FTF 2048\n* Overlap 50%\n\nBrick Wall Second\n* Frequency 3\n* Upper Frequency 8291\n* Length 948\n\nI just tried a variety of settings willy-nilly and happened to have success with this one \namong a couple others.  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jimskinnard&quot; &lt;joliet@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone using dc6/dc7(Diamond Cut DC7) software. I have been\n&gt; experimenting with different filters to listen and record radio\n&gt; sweep(RS hack 20-125).\n&gt; \n&gt; I wonder if anyone has found good filters and mods to the filters for\n&gt; using it real time filtering. The other day I threw together some of\n&gt; there pre-built filters and got a good session(easier to listen to).\n&gt; The next session those filters did not seem to work as well. \n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a quote from the site below(not the software distributor).\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;DC6 is an audio editing program just like the ones we use for EVP\n&gt; (Audacity, Audition, GoldWave), except it has a neat feature called\n&gt; &quot;Live Multi-Filter.&quot; With this feature, audio coming into the computer\n&gt; can be filtered live and the result heard with a short delay of a\n&gt; second or so. A typical setup for EVP would be a microphone into the\n&gt; Microphone In jack of the computer with DC6 Live filtering what comes\n&gt; from the microphone and the output playing on the headphones connected\n&gt; to the computer&#39;s Headphone Out.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; For those that have not heard of it, hear is a page explaining on how\n&gt; to use this piece of software.\n&gt; http://www.aaevp.com/techniques/techniques_evp11.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Jim S.\n&gt;"}
