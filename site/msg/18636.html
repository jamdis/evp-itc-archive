&gt;   Frank, Reading all the BS those two were spewing on a daily basis, did
&gt; not contribute one positive idea or thought. This is your group and I
&gt; support your decision to do whatever you feel is necessary to keep the group
&gt; intact and a pleasant place to be.
&gt;
&gt; I, for one am sick and tired of those who demand &quot;scientific&quot; evidence,
&gt; when dealing with a reality  which is not scientifically based and never
&gt; will be.  Those who wish to walk down that narrow minded path will never
&gt; experience what we have experienced.  Thank you for your willingness to
&gt; &quot;uninvite&quot; those who only want to place negativity into the group.

&gt;  I&#x27;ll repeat it just to be clear. The two I kicked off never accepted any
&gt; evidence, ignored all examples of voices others posted, regardless of how
&gt; clear they were. Claimed all they heard was gibbersih from the boxes, yet
&gt; presented themselves as somehow more qualified to test the paranormal.
&gt; Always no data, no evidence, while ignoring everything presented.  They tend
&gt; to imply all the EVP voices were the brain trying to make sense out of
&gt; chaotic noise, nothing more. When questioned as to their motives they acuse
&gt; me of attacking them.
&gt;
&gt;  I&#x27;ve been doing this stuff for ten years, and the two were pretty typical
&gt; of most debunker/skeptics who deny deny deny, ignore ignore ignore and claim
&gt; a higher intellect. I reached my saturation point.
&gt;
&gt;  They wanted to quote the statement on the group home page, which in fact
&gt; states I will kick off people that appear to be debunkers.
&gt;
&gt;  Other methods are fine, not methods of debunking though! The box is one
&gt; method of supplying the raw audio, just as white noise is a method of
&gt; supplying the raw audio. *My opinion* is that the spirits and entities
&gt; communicate best if they have something to make their voices out of, and the
&gt; box, aka a swept radio, provides bits of speech music and noise for that
&gt; purpose. I do not know anything about the so called paranormal, I don&#x27;t do
&gt; &quot;investigations&quot;, don&#x27;t go to haunted areas to get EVPs. I do this stuff out
&gt; of curiosity, and remain intrigued with these voices from a &quot;broken radio&quot;.
&gt; It really pisses me off to have someone who can&#x27;t hear the stuff tell me
&gt; what it really is.
