I think it might have tricked my friends on the other side, too, as I told them your &quot;hint.&quot;  I did hear &quot;shar&quot; - I have people with various accents - but didn&#39;t think of what that word might represent.  We all get many answers, because our GBs draw little crowds. As for comments on the next experiment, I&#39;ve offered one to help spirits find the object!\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rasterer&quot; &lt;rasterer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks to everyone who participated in Experiment 2.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Friday, 7/16/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer monitor, right in front of me, and left it there until noon Denver time on Monday, 7/19/2010.   This experiment asked for participants to determine what that object was. Vague or partial answers would not be counted (for example, just giving a color, shape, size,  what it&#39;s made of, etc): we&#39;re looking for what it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#39;t count.  Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means they chose.  \n&gt; \n&gt; In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the object at the start of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group.  The idea with this file is that you could download it at the beginning of the experiment and &#39;keep it safe&#39; on your computer. Then at the end of the experiment, I would post the password so you can reveal the contents of the file. That way, you were in control of the original image during the entire time, not me.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Passworded pdf: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; The password for that file is: 2plus2isFour\n&gt; Instructions, if you need them for the other files, are also in that RJ folder.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So to the results:\n&gt; \n&gt; Number of participants: 6\n&gt; Total tries: 29\n&gt; Ambiguous answers: 0\n&gt; Correct answers: 0\n&gt; \n&gt; Object: Chair\n&gt; Object picture: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.jpg\n&gt; \n&gt; As a little side experiment, on Monday I also asked if anyone had gotten any answers that might indicate an article of clothing (though I did not say why I was asking).   One theory is that the human operator can be influenced by things they already know or suspect, and so interpret audio with their own personal &#39;educated guesses&#39;, that would differ from what they would hear had they not known those things.  This side experiment did indicate some support for that theory, since before I mentioned &#39;articles of clothing&#39;, no one included an article of clothing in their results.  But after I mentioned it, several reports of clothing began to appear.  I did not add these tries to the results above.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let me know. Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this experiment.\n&gt;"}
