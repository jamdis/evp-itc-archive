Hi guys.

As some of you know, I work with the inimi=
table Stacey Jones in a
ghost hunting group called Central New York Ghost H=
unters. We have a
TV show that plays throughout Central NY (accessible to o=
ver 1.5
million viewers total) called CNY Spirits.

In this episode, which =
has been uploaded to youtube, you can see the
Minibox Plus on an investigat=
ion. It was used in tandem with a poker
game and garnered some amazing resu=
lts. The Minibox was used in part
2, and everyones favorite shack hack was =
used in part 3. To my
knowledge, this is the first time a Minibox has been =
used on
television. You will have to ignore what Stacey says about the
Mini=
box because she was dead wrong on most of her facts. I wish that
the produc=
er had interviewed me so I could have explained it a helluva
lot better.

I=
f you are wondering, I am the goofy looking guy with the pony tail and tatt=
oos.

You can check out pt 1 here:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Danxfj8=
Dlrus&feature=3Drelated

This episode was a followup investigation to a pri=
or one done about 6
weeks earlier. This earlier investigation yielded some =
amazing EVP's
and flashlight responses. YOu can view pt 1 here:

http://www=
.youtube.com/watch?v=3DEy6uHks4aj4&feature=3Drelated

These are some of the=
 clips from that session.

The clip about "pissing me off" has become prett=
y famous because
Stacey uses it when she lectures at conferences. It is ver=
y
intriguing because it is her voice coming through the Hack while she
is s=
itting at the table. I have discussed this clip with a few of
you, and here=
 it is a lot cleaner than in the video.

The rest of the clips are from the=
 poker session that were not in the
video. On the "Holding a Five" clip, Mi=
ke actually had a pair of
fives in his hand.

Tim
