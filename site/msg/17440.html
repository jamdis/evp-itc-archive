I agree that science is capable of designing controlled tests of EVP/ITC cl=
aims. 
I disagree that failure of such tests constitutes "accepting no evid=
ence".
It is being honest about the results.

I agree that not all people w=
ho say they hear voices on these recordings are not lying or crazy.
I disag=
ree that this is 'proof' of anything.
But it doesn't mean they are not bein=
g honest about the results.

I agree it is 'evidence' of something.
I disag=
ree that simply then making a claim as to what it was, must be true, especi=
ally since different people claim different things, and where they conflict=
 can't all be right.
I disagree that those skeptical of some or all of the =
evidence or claims are ignoring them.
They can still be honest, and disagre=
e.

So, everyone involved could be honest and sane.=C2=A0 Everyone involved=
 could interpret evidence differently.=C2=A0 Everyone involved can come to =
different conclusions.=C2=A0 

And if everyone involved worked together, us=
ing their different skills and perspectives, all lot more progress could be=
 made. 

Instead of just telling someone what they believe is wrong, we sho=
uld ask them why they believe it?=C2=A0 What led them to that belief?=C2=A0=
 What prevents another belief being as true instead?=C2=A0 

This requires =
conversation.=C2=A0 Those stopping this conversation are the ones who will =
not listen to another viewpoint.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 And from what I see post=
ed here, they aren't the skeptics.

Two highl=

called=
 "Handbook to the Afterlife". They are Dr. Pamela Rae Heath and Dr. Jon
Kli=

they have distilled hundreds of channeled messages from many centuri=

attempt to present a comprehensive mixture of what these message m=

us about the nature of death and the afterlife. Heath and Klimo c=

this book is not for everyone. It is for those who find =
the topic interesting and 
wonder what has been learned from such=C2=A0 com=
munications. Clearly those who 
doubt such communications are possible or w=
ho disbelieve in the concept of 
afterlife probably will have no use for th=
is book.
=C2=A0
Here are two well-known scientists (in the Parapsychology c=
ommunity) who
acknoweldge that sometimes it is more important to suggest wh=
at might be
possible than to stand only on that which is empirically provea=
ble. The very
nature of science is to explain where possible and to recogni=
ze that quite
often the right answer to many questions is "I don't know."
=
=C2=A0
Dr. Julie Beischel and Dr. Gary Schwartz have conducted extensive re=
search
into mediumship. What that research has demonstrated is that there a=
re 
people who can know things they should not with no known ways of this 
=
happening. This is called 'anomalous information reception' in Parapsycholo=
gy.
The point is that we know this anomalous ability exists. What we do not=
 
know, from the Science, is whether discarnate entities are communicating.=

Certainly the research mediums involved believe so, such is the nature of
=
their compelling experiences. But the Science cannot, to date, support
the =
claim. And that is what is critical to understand here.
=C2=A0
At the same =
time, it is important to recognize that using technology does
not necessari=
ly imply the Scientific Method nor does is mean one is doing 
Science. What=
 it does mean is that a part of the experience is documented
and that might=
 be useful at some future time when Science does have the 
tools and unders=
tanding to further evaluate the documents. Today this is, 
unfortunately, s=
imply not true.
=C2=A0
What is known is that people are recording audio and=
 video and believe 
they have captured anomalies. Many people think these r=
epresent voices
of spirits and loved ones. Unfortuantely the pure truth is =
that Science is 
simply not in a position to validate this at this time. Bu=
t that does not 
mean anyone should stop, nor that anyone should feel they =
have no reason
to guess what might be going on, or to speculate about the p=
henomena.
=C2=A0
It also means that cynics and skeptics who demand proof ar=
e going to
have a hard time finding it. If Science is not yet able to descr=
ibe what it
is that is going on, skeptics and cynics have no way to determi=
ne what 
is absolute proof. They can however choose to accept some personal=
 
variant of their own truth as acceptable proof should they so desire.
But=
 this is not empirical proof as required by Science.
=C2=A0
Dr. Donald Hoff=
man is an expert on visual perception and is one of 
the authors of "Consci=
ous Realism" - a scientific theory of reality
which is the first to solve t=
he mind/body problem. Dr. Hoffman is one
scientist who completely understan=
ds how people misperceive things,
and yet his controversial theories challe=
nge even some of the world's 
leading theoretical physicists when it comes =
to understanding. Clearly
there are scientists who appreciate this phenomen=
a may well be real.
I have personal dialogs with them frequently. You would=
 simply not
believe how frustrating it is for someone whose job it is to ex=
plain 
the world to others to have no idea whatsoever what might be going
o=
n here.
=C2=A0
I hope this helps put a face on Science, and that I have suc=
cintly
but=C2=A0 clearly explained why Science offers no magic explanations=

at this time. And at the same time, perhaps this will better set
expectati=
ons for everyone while recognizing that the work being

have potential merit in the due course of time.
