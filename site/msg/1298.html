<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce,

Last I heard Frank Sumption is on hiatus for a little while to relax
and rest a bit. Every once in a while everyone has to take a step back
and breath. From what I am told that is what he is doing. Be patient
and he will re-emerge and may take requests again.

Regards,

Frank Ratka

&gt; I have been doing evp research for a number of years now and have 
&gt; exhausted all venues so when something like this comes along of course 
&gt; it is a m7ust have for the serious researcher. I have been 
&gt; experimenting with the sweep method only for a few days but to me it is 
&gt; just another evp recording method and still needs to be edited and you 
&gt; don&#x27;t have that real time communication.
&gt; I was disabled at 911 and have all the time in the world to experiment 
&gt; so I believe the box would be put to good use. can anyone steer me in 
&gt; the right direction as far as who to contact or how to have a box built?
&gt; 
&gt; all help is greatly appreciated.
