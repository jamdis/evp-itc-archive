Which file do you hear it in?\n&gt;\n&gt; It is an auto sweep, so you hear the regular switching of the channels.\n&gt; This particular device adds more white noise in the background, so maybe\n&gt; that is what you are hearing as well. It has more of shhhh sound per switch\n&gt; than a Frank&#39;s box or shack hack.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sun, Jun 6, 2010 at 6:43 PM, &lt;SnowfireL@aol.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  sounds like chains rattling, what&#39;s making the heavy noise? sounds like\n&gt;&gt; banging something together, like metal objects\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  In a message dated 6/6/2010 6:40:12 P.M.

Unfortunatley\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; will hear her say what she thinks she hears in the files. Please try\n&gt;&gt; not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to be influenced by her. I will admit though that she seems to hear\n&gt;&gt; &gt; these\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; things much better then I can.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Though I am still not convinced, some of these are uncanny, and I was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; surprised.
