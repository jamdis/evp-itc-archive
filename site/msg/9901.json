Now i can actually start to hear the message \na lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise that \ndon&#39;t belong and eliminate them from the mix.  You can&#39;t piece these \nfiles together to make something it&#39;s not, so i keep them in true \nform pretty much to the original.\n\n-Steve\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey Steve   Forgot to ask...how much editing was needed to get this \nfile?
