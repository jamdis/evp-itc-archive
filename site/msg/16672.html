<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>New to the group so I figured I would would say hello:)  

I have A LOT of experience in electronics and I&#x27;m considering building &quot;something&quot; to experiment with EM fields and look for interactions in the spirit world.  I was directed here by another site which mentioned possible plans or schematics but after searching around for a while I find not to much on Franks Design.  Did I just miss it?  If someone could point me in proper direction that would be appreciated!

Thanks!!</pre>
