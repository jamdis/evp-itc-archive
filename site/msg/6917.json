It&#39;s been bugging me alot. Could=\r\n that be a special group on their side ? I have no clue. Also has anyone qu=\r\nestioned the voices if they have a last name ? All I hear on the RS boxes a=\r\nre first names and haven&#39;t recieved anyone telling me their last name. Does=\r\n Mike and Lisa have a last name ? Did anyone here ever ask the question &quot; A=\r\nre you Demonic Spirits ? &quot; What was their reply if any ? I did one time and=\r\n got a response saying &quot; All of us are &quot;. Don&#39;t know whether I believe that=\r\n Spirit or not. Probably a Joker saying that. I have asked for specific peo=\r\nple for them to find so I could talk to and got an answer &quot; We&#39;re looking. =\r\n&quot; Then I never heard from them after that. I&#39;m still waiting to be contacte=\r\nd by Telephone so far nothing yet. They make me laugh sometimes. I had the =\r\nRS-12-469 on the one day I was just listening to what they were chatting ab=\r\nout. I found my daughters old Fart Machine and was playing with it while th=\r\ne RS radio was running to see if it still works which it did. All of a sudd=\r\nen after I made it &quot; Toot &quot; I heard a female voice say &quot; Phew !!! .&quot;LOL, I =\r\nguess she thought I really passed one. Also, the other day I was on the RS =\r\n12-469 and I said &quot; Hello Lisa how are you doing today ? &quot; Then a few secon=\r\nds later I hear a female voice say &quot; Bruce ? &quot; like she thought that I was =\r\nBruce talking to her. I told her no it&#39;s me Ralph from Harrisburg,PA she re=\r\nplied &quot;Oh, okay fine. &quot; I hear all the time voices calling for Lisa she mus=\r\nt be a very Popular Technician.
