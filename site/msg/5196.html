Hi Bruce   Glad I got 3 out of 4 words in the first test.  Maybe a contest is needed with prize money...just kidding.  
   
  I want to ask you about voice recognition systems that you and others are doing but I will put that into a separate email.   Thanks for the opportunity to guess.  I hope to get better at it.   Ron L

          Hey guy's 

The unlabeled files experiment was a resounding flop!

Only a hand full of members responded with what they did or did not 
hear.

This is how I heard them
#4_There are three circles

#8_David's just their guard

The percentage of people that responded that they heard what I had heard
was about 40% the individuals that heard some of what I heard but not 
all was about 30% with the remaining 30% hearing something completely 
different.

This type of experiment needs to be done on a regular basis with a 
substantial ammount of participents, otherwise the averages can not be 
calculated and a general theory formed that is acceptable to most 
researchers in this field.

If there is anyone else that would like to have a go at it I will be 
glad to participate.

Bruce
