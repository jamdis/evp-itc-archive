Yes it seems pretty normal that it works that way. It&#39;s always good to record to catch what you may miss hearing yourself. Glad its going well for you!\n\nMisty\n\n\n--- On Fri, 9/12/08, tonyandsue13 &lt;tonyandsue13@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: tonyandsue13 &lt;tonyandsue13@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Hi, New Member from UK\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, September 12, 2008, 9:56 PM\n&gt; Within the last week I came across the concept of the ghost\n&gt; box \n&gt; (Frank&#39;s box) and have had immediate results.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is actually using a mobile phone on radio mode with a\n&gt; manual scan, \n&gt; simply holding down the button and it scans through the FM\n&gt; bands either \n&gt; up or down. There was no white noise being played at the\n&gt; same time nor \n&gt; on review.\n&gt; \n&gt; What surprised me was the clarity of the answers to direct\n&gt; questions \n&gt; which could then be checked on a reviewing the tape. But\n&gt; also that on \n&gt; one ocassion the replies weren&#39;t audible until the\n&gt; replay of the taped \n&gt; session was heard.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this typical?\n&gt; \n&gt; I can upload the sessions which are quite interesting due\n&gt; to the \n&gt; subject being discussed."}
