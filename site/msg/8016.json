The basic premise for traditional evp cap=\r\nture is that the spirit or entity that is grounded or in visitation at a se=\r\nt location, will manipulate the ambient energy available to it that surroun=\r\nds the recording medium, be it a digital or analog recorder. It uses this e=\r\nnergy, usually thought to be EMF energy to place an asimally of a voice ont=\r\no the recorder. The recording is then uploaded to a computer and is gone ov=\r\ner by the researcher/investigator to search for these little whispered voic=\r\nes on the recording. This traditional way of gathering spirit communication=\r\n serves it&#39;s purpose or at least has served it&#39;s purpose. &gt; &gt; When you deci=\r\nded to pick up a box, everything you ever learned about spirit communicatio=\r\nn ceased to apply. Box communication in a nutshell, no matter what type of =\r\nbox you use is run on the same premise. The box or radio is made to sweep t=\r\nhe dial fast enough so that no stable or whole radio signal is captured. Th=\r\ne signal is therefore fragmented into small bits of sound and fragments of =\r\nhuman speech. The idea is for our spirit friends to be able to manipulate t=\r\nhe fragments of sound to form intelligible words, phrases and messages that=\r\n we can understand clearly.&gt; &gt; As you know the major factor in the differen=\r\nce between box research and traditional EVP is the fact that you can and mo=\r\nst certainly do hear spirit communication through a box live and in real ti=\r\nme.&gt; That&#39;s what sets this apart from any other paranormal communication re=\r\nsearch in the world or even the history of paranormal research.&gt; &gt; The rese=\r\narch you are embarking on now will take time and patience to become accusto=\r\nmed too but eventually with experience comes stronger communication, a bett=\r\ner relationship between you and your spirit tech/guides and a better ear fo=\r\nr hearing and discerning spirit communication from ordinary radio noise.&gt; &gt;=\r\n this is just a quick explanation but don&#39;t worry anyone here that knows me=\r\n can tell you there will be much more to come.&gt; &gt; The reason I started this=\r\n reply was your reference to class a EVP, in box research there is no such =\r\nthing, you either hear it or you don&#39;t.&gt; &gt; Mike my ears and my mouth are al=\r\nways open so any questions, don&#39;t hesitate.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; Bruce Halliday &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nTo: EVP-ITC@: f1cracker75@: Tue, 18 Mar 2008 14:42:44 -0700Subject: RE: [EV=\r\nP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Bruce, yeah I am new to t=\r\nhe group. 4 weeks now.
