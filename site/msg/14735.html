  Here is =
what I experienced just recently. We were at a fairly famous
  investigatio=
n spot. The group before us were "releasing" the spirits. 
  Funny how we g=
ot soooo many evp's just a few minutes after the spirits
  were "helped" by=
 this group. Leads me to feel that we are just making
  ourselves feel good=
 about ourselves for "helping" them over. I don't
  think we can help a lot=
 of those spirits. They are there for a
  reason...they need to work out so=
me sort of karma...and when that
  happens...they can continue.
