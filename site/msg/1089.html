<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello to all,
I have recently joined the group, having had an interest in this area
for some time.However my field of expertise is in computing rather
than electronic engineering, I am intrigued by the number of reports I
have read concerning &quot;robotic&quot; voices.
Some of the earliest reports I have read (early 70&#x27;s) on EVP were
based  on this type of recording.

Questions:
I would like to make a study of using computing devices (now they are
Multimedia compatible, with built in Mic&#x27;s etc) and I have noticed
software is already available e.g. EVPmaker and sound wave analyzers.
Is there a feature of the Internet or web technologies which &quot;the
other side&quot; has\are utilising, along with traditional technologies ?

two, has anybody studied these robotic voice communications?
 I
would like to test a theory that these could be Alien type
transmissions, however I have to accept the evidence that parody is
another feature of EVP transmissions as well!

Regards,


Derek
