<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>In part the change is due to wise council from little ol&#x27; muah! I had 
a rather long talk with Ron after I heard an investigator tell me 
they were thinking of handing over the Box to their teenager and 
allow the child and her friends to have an electronic Ouija pajama 
party. Ron totally agreed with me that this is not the best method of 
testing ala the change.

&gt; Not misinformation. The page has been changed as of Dec 3rd! Imagine
&gt; that. The article did indeed state that children and high school
&gt; students would be part of the testing groups as well as skeptic,
&gt; believers, etc. 
&gt; Yes I did notice the discrepancy between the asup article and the
&gt; disclaimers on the paranormal sytems page.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I pulled this list of general recommendations for The MiniBox 
right
&gt; &gt; &gt; off Ron&#x27;s www.paranormalsystems.com page -
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Do not allow children under the age of 16 to use this device
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Although individual sessions are effective, group sessions 
are more
&gt; &gt; &gt; productive.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. This is not an &#x27;electronic Ouija board&#x27; - no harm can come 
from
&gt; &gt; &gt; using it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Some voices will use coarse language so be prepared for it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Always use a recorder to tape all sessions
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Keep a notebook with the times and locations of your 
sessions.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 7. The MiniBox will call you by name so don&#x27;t be startled by it.
