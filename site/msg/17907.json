They may be  too fast, but I did try \nto slow them a bit,  I know, these  are very hard to hear, got them last \nnight in response to Steve&#39;s letter about  all the &quot;religious&quot;  crap I&#39;ve been \nsending,  such weird files I  sometimes send in lately.  I do not control \nwhat spirits say though, after  all they are just people too.  Got one on here \nthat&#39;s really funny, I think  it has a little demon on it too, he seems \nvery angry, and wants someone to &quot;Let  me out!  Let me out!&quot; is what he is \nsaying, I think he is wanting to come  after some folks, because, even demon&#39;s \nbelieve in God.  He really  sounds mad at some people and wants &quot;.....out,&quot; \njust going to let you hear it,  may need to play it several times to hear, \nbut I think its kinda cute. I told  them what some on the lists were saying, \nand this was the  response.  btw  Is someone going to Florida ?  The last one \nsays  something about FL Hope you all enjoy them.  sf\n\r\n--part1_5cade.7bd3cd07.39688bad_alt_boundary\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3DUS-ASCII&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Type&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18928&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot; id=3Drole_body =\r\n bottomMargin=3D7 leftMargin=3D7 rightMargin=3D7 topMargin=3D7&gt;&lt;FONT id=3Dr=\r\nole_document  color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#40=\r\n8080&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Well, got no response out of the other list, \nlet&#39;s see if any=\r\n of you folks on these lists can hear these at all.
