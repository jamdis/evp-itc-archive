I agree...frame of mind is definitely important.\n\nI have only done the regular evp with a digital voice rec.\nI would LOVE to own an actual box someday, but am happy to have this \nfor now.\nWhat&#39;s a speakjet?\n\n~ Laura\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Early Cuyler &lt;ecuyler@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve got the 20-125 and an older 12-469 sans speaker and clicking.  \nThe 20-125 works wonderfully and has produced great results.  The 12-\n469 has produced great results also.  Bruce can testify to the \ncommunication he gets with the 20-125.  \n&gt; \n&gt; In the end, it all depends on signal strength and our spirit \nfriends capability to communicate, not to mention our state of mind \nwhen we conduct a session.  There are a lot of variables involved, so \nthere really is no one box better than the others in my opinion.  \nAlthough, Frank seems to get some tremendous results with his \ncreations.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m actually going to attempt a Speakjet box.  I hope I can get \npast my semi-electronic retardedness and make it work.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Jeremy"}
