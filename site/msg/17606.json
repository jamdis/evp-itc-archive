A box session forces one to listen through  \nthe\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; noise as opposed to the silence.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Were these sessions recorded an=\r\nd listened back too or was an analysis  \nmade\n&gt; &gt; strictly from real time? =\r\nI do sessions all the time and I  am lucky if \nI can\n&gt; &gt; pick up 35% of wha=\r\nt comes through in real  time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And finally, try not to be too disma=\r\nyed. An  EVP &#39;expert&#39; makes their \nbread\n&gt; &gt; and butter parading their EVP =\r\n techniques. I witnessed one such expert \nwho we\n&gt; &gt; all have at  least hea=\r\nrd of create an EVP. How? The person in question\n&gt; &gt;  scratched their thumb=\r\n nail against the recorders mic to create a \nsound.  This\n&gt; &gt; person then p=\r\nlayed back the recorder to me and pitched it  down to make \nwhat\n&gt; &gt; this p=\r\nerson say what was heard sound more  convincing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If I made my money=\r\n parading my EVP  ability, I would discredit your box \ntoo.\n&gt; &gt; Why? Becaus=\r\ne box users  are the future of ITC and paranormal research. \nIt is\n&gt; &gt; rela=\r\ntively  cheap, vastly available, and provides instant gratuity when\n&gt; &gt;  op=\r\nerating. Who wants to sit alone in the dark talking to silence when  \nyou\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; can hear the responses in real time? EVP is still a valid  form of\n&gt; &gt; c=\r\nommunication, but ghost boxes threaten an EVP experts  way to make \nmoney.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Boxes are being used more and more,  especially on the television shows=\r\n \nand\n&gt; &gt; public hunts. This hurts  the revenue stream for EVP experts who =\r\nused \nto be\n&gt; &gt; the ones  getting invited to guest star on hunts for a fee;=\r\n they are now\n&gt; &gt;  being replaced by box users.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In short, box use c=\r\nan  be discredited by every expert and skeptic in the\n&gt; &gt; field. It  doesn&#39;=\r\nt matter. Ghost box use now has its place in paranormal\n&gt; &gt;  culture and it=\r\n is not going to leave it anytime soon.

I can assure you that \nghost\n&gt; &gt; boxe=\r\ns aren&#39;t going anywhere because  the majority of these people have \nat\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nleast a shack hack in  their paranormal arsenal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So let this expert=\r\n  discredit to his or her&#39;s hearts&#39; content.

This is a genuine Class A EVP, which is a \n    rare thing. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;We were conducting a session and you can hear the cycle \n    through end=\r\ning and starting again. We were just about to end the session and \n    had =\r\njust called for any last minute communications when this clip occurred. \n  =\r\n  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I use Google Chrome as a browser, so and it has problems with \n  =\r\n  attachments.

Electronic Voice Phenomena is a \n    completely different&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; animal. That is not to say however that one \n    couldn&#39;t get an EVP duri=\r\nng a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ghost box session.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n    &lt;DIV class=3Dh5&gt;&gt; On Wed, Jun 9, 2010 at 3:04 PM, tim_woolworth \n =\r\n   &lt;tim@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; S=\r\no \n    you have stated that the person conducting this study was an EVP \n  =\r\n  expert?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; That leads me to question how the study was actually=\r\n \n    conducted. Listening to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the box is certainly not like li=\r\nstening \n    to an EVP and I personally disagree&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; vehemently wi=\r\nth the people \n    out there who call box communications EVP&#39;s!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In an \n    EVP situation, you are listening closely for a vo=\r\nice to sound&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n    typically over the quiet. A box session forc=\r\nes one to listen through \n    the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; noise as opposed to the sile=\r\nnce.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n    Were these sessions recorded and listen=\r\ned back too or was an analysis \n    made&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; strictly from real ti=\r\nme? I do sessions all the time and I \n    am lucky if I can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; pi=\r\nck up 35% of what comes through in real \n    time.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; And finally, try not to be too dismayed. An \n    EVP &#39;expert&#39; makes their=\r\n bread&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and butter parading their EVP \n    techniques. I witnes=\r\nsed one such expert who we&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; all have at \n    least heard of cre=\r\nate an EVP. How? The person in question&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n    scratched their t=\r\nhumb nail against the recorders mic to create a sound. \n    This&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; person then played back the recorder to me and pitched it \n    down to m=\r\nake what&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; this person say what was heard sound more \n    convin=\r\ncing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If I made my money parading my EVP \n    abi=\r\nlity, I would discredit your box too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Why? Because box users \n=\r\n    are the future of ITC and paranormal research. It is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; relat=\r\nively \n    cheap, vastly available, and provides instant gratuity when&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; \n    operating. Who wants to sit alone in the dark talking to sile=\r\nnce when \n    you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; can hear the responses in real time? EVP is =\r\nstill a valid \n    form of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; communication, but ghost boxes thre=\r\naten an EVP experts \n    way to make money.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Boxes are being us=\r\ned more and more, \n    especially on the television shows and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\npublic hunts. This hurts \n    the revenue stream for EVP experts who used t=\r\no be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the ones \n    getting invited to guest star on hunts for =\r\na fee; they are now&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n    being replaced by box users.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In short, box use can \n    be discredited by every expert=\r\n and skeptic in the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; field. It \n    doesn&#39;t matter. Ghost box u=\r\nse now has its place in paranormal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n    culture and it is not =\r\ngoing to leave it anytime soon. Being situated in \n    a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; paran=\r\normal group that is lead by a para-celebrity has put me \n    in the unique&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; position of visiting other groups and working \n    with the ot=\r\nher&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; para-celebrities in this field quite frequently. \n    I ca=\r\nn assure you that ghost&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; boxes aren&#39;t going anywhere because \n =\r\n   the majority of these people have at&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; least a shack hack in =\r\n\n    their paranormal arsenal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; So let this expert=\r\n \n    discredit to his or her&#39;s hearts&#39; content.

Based=\r\n on what we know about \n    trans-etheric influences, how EVP&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nand&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; visual \n    forms of ITC are formed and what we know =\r\nabout mediumship, it is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n    &gt; &gt; difficult to fit radio-sweep=\r\n into any established hypothesis. \n    Without&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; solid&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; research supporting it as \n    producing EVP, it is impossible for=\r\n us to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; recommend it or \n    support its use.
