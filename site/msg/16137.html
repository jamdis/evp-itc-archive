<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I can&#x27;t tell, Frank, are you joking around with me?  Or did you seriously talk to Copernicus? (Probably the former?) 

And thanks, Wyatt, for your reply.  I&#x27;m wondering if a haunting-type situation such as yours would be different from talking to your ancestors four or five generations back?  I guess I&#x27;m just wondering out loud what makes us connect with some entities, no matter how obscure or nonexistent the connection, and not others?  What makes some &quot;tune in&quot; to talk to us, or hang around on a plane closest to us...or what?  At least in a haunting, you&#x27;d be getting the entity that happened to reside at that location.

Never mind me, guys.  I just have this driving need to understand how all this works, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible.

&gt; &gt; Those of you who have contacted entities claiming to be dead people, what is the oldest person you&#x27;ve spoken to (in terms of how long ago they died)?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m wondering because my great uncle has been coming through a lot, and he was murdered in 1942.  Since I wasn&#x27;t born until decades later, I never knew him, but I do understand that people come through we did not know in life.  Has anyone else contacted someone claiming to have lived that far back?  Or in another lifetime entirely?
