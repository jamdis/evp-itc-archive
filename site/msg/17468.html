<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Your AM band made more linguistic sense.  That 11 secs on the FM is really cool because the voice is very consistent; wish I could completely understand the first two words he was saying though.

AM band:

@.01: Hello (female)
@.02: Frank don&#x27;t act yet (male)
@.04: Am I speaking (female)
- directly after this are two or three words, I cannot make them out, but it may be &quot;to you&quot; + &quot;?&quot;
@.06: I&#x27;m trying (male)
@.07: I don&#x27;t fu -or- fa(soft vowel sound) (female)
@.09: What it is (jenny? johnny?) (male)
@.10: Tonight (male)
@.11: I&#x27;m just going to get out of here (male, accented)

FM band:

@.01: Please give these your (male)
@.04: Time today (singing)
@.09: Girl (signing)
@.11: What (one) o&#x27;shock (o&#x27;shack?) are you getting (male)
@.14: Who (cut off by clip)

Good stuff.
