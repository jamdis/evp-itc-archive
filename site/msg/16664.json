The sound comes out the open ends.  That inspired me to install my own multi component layout in a similar pipe I had and use it also for a resonator. (the white pipe looks better painted black)  I cut the slots with a drill and dremmel tool.\nMy results speak for themselves (see my photo)\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  I think this might be a solution to expensive cases.
