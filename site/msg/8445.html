<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce,
I, for one, appreciate the post.  I am new to this research, but not new
to paranormal investigations.  I can see where the stated content would be
of a concern to many...including myself.  Actually, I had suspected that
this research may, indeed, create a passageway.  How could it not? 
Anyway, I thank you for the post.

&gt; okay, okay!
&gt;
&gt; Lets put this to bed here and now.
&gt; My post was not about fear or the acknowledgment of it.
&gt; It was about the concerns of a new researcher!
&gt;
&gt; And no matter what anyone&#x27;s opinion is regarding the subject matter,
&gt; including my own.
&gt;
&gt; The concern was real to the person that experienced it.
&gt; I felt that he would appreciate me addressing it publicly on the forum
&gt; on the chance that other &quot;NEW&quot; researchers may have similar concerns.
&gt;
&gt; It was just what I posted it as &quot;an incident that may be a concern&quot;
&gt;
&gt; It is not a matter of fear or pushing any buttons, it&#x27;s a matter of
&gt; knowledge.
&gt; Even if that knowledge is important to only one individual, that does
&gt; not make it any less important.
&gt;
&gt; We have to remember that a lot of the new researchers and people
&gt; getting interested in this field is due to the recent surge of
&gt; publicity that we have gotten and all may not be seasoned paranormal
&gt; veterans and adopted the philosophy of staring down the negative
&gt; aspects of the paranormal.
&gt;
&gt; And I don&#x27;t think that their education from any experienced
&gt; researcher should include, if you ignore it that means it does not
&gt; exist or can not affect any aspect of what we are doing.
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t want to open this whole can of worms again.
&gt; If a new person voices a concern, and all concerns deserve to be
&gt; addressed for the benefit of who ever needs it.
&gt;
&gt; My opinion on it or post about a certain incident is not meant to be
&gt; the word of god or carved in stone. It is just what it is
&gt; an opinion or a simple statement.
&gt;
&gt; Bruce
