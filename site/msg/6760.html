<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Here is a perfect example of my &quot;Technition&quot; Lisa getting frustrated
with me asking the same question like 4 times due to the fact that I
usually hear the answer to this question live but did not this time.

when I finally did she said &quot;Yes&quot; in a like sort of &quot;ok enough already&quot;
tone of voice.


the file goes &quot;any spirit came threw can you let me know if they are
back_YESSSSSS.wav

Also this is a question I ask due to the fact that I believe entities
can travel back and forth across the open line of live communication.
