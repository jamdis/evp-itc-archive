Thats kind of you to offer Bill =) Id say me, but I'd need a video instruction book to go with it LOL with you going you put this thingy into that thingamajigger. Is there welding involved? (I dont do it)
   
  I KNEW I should have played with the older boys building radios when I was in school. But I was way too shy then and only in grade school so I did crafts with the older girls. Advanced classes were interesting but my shyness didnt help. So for the technically challenged (like me) perhaps you could lay out a mock instruction plan with a pic or two?
   
  I know quite a few on the group dont need it, and probably understand what you are saying completely.

          thanks for taking the trouble to look, Bill.

i have a yahoo messenger webcam set up for members of franks-evp only 
for better explanatios/demonstrations. if anyone wants an evp 
competent (or wtf) 1n34 to plug into their tape machine AND is a 
member of this group only , i'll send them out as long as i can 
afford it/can spare time. worth the effort IMO for patient detail 
conscious researchers which evp-ers seem to be. the described 
procedure should work on first or second try for those that can put 
together crystal receiver and plug it into amplifier.--with smal cap 
to ground plug, you could even do it with a tape recorder. all long 
wires that can act as antennas can then be removed and only diode or 
diode and tuned circuit employed. whole assembly can be rotated to 
block out radio stations.
