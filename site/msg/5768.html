Hi Ralph!  You have a fascinating background.  Your experience hacking the =
radios is similar to mine and is the reason I've got two sitting here that =
I'm afraid to touch!  It sounds like you are well on your way to great succ=
ess and will have a lot to contribute to the group.

Robin

  Hi all,
=

  I'm a new member of the group and I am an Investigator of the 
  Paranor=
mal here in central PA. My group's name is SPIRIT Paranormal 
  Investigati=
on Team. I have been doing this in groups now for 6 years.
  I had my own g=
roup H.I.P.S. (Harrisburg Independent Paranormal 
  Society) and now I am i=
n the SPIRIT group out of Selinsgrove,PA. I 
  also use to be with Kelly We=
aver's group Capital Ghost Forum which is 
  now called Spirit Society of P=
A. I had to leave her group because of 
  my work schedule. I have been on =
Ghost Investigations with TAPS to 
  Waverly Hills Sanatorium,Ky, Eastern S=
tate Pennitentiary in PA. I 
  have 
  also investigated St. Augustine Ligh=
thouse in Fla. I did have a 
  chance 
  to meet Bill Murphy here in Gettys=
burg,PA. on the Battlefield near 
  the 
  Wheatfield last year for a short=
 time. He is a nice guy. I let him 
  listen to some of my EVP's from the W=
heatfield and Triangular Field 
  that day we met. I have been called an " =
EVP Medium " by my peers. I 
  have a ton of them. I would like to thank "F=
rank Sumption" for his 
  inspiring work with his boxes and giving of his t=
ime and knowledge to 
  inspire us to do our own research to find the answe=
rs we are all 
  looking for in this world. Thanks, Frank for your inspirat=
ion and 
  hard 
  work we all appreciate it. I would also like to thank "S=
um Duck" 
  and "Mike Coletta" for coming up with those Hacks that made it =
easy 
  for me and all the others out there that are Electronically 
  illi=
terate.
  Thank you guys we all appreciate it too. Oh well I just wanted to=
 put 
  my two cents in to let you know I'm with you all. Oh, I have two 12=
-
  469's the first one I broke trying to hack it LOL. The other one 
  wor=
ks 
  great. I also have the 12-470(old model) which I tried to hack but I =

  cut the wrong wire. I cut the green wire (seventh wire from the top 
  a=
s 
  Mike said to do)and when I put everything back together I had no AM 
 =
 Band LOL. So I opened it up again and was thinking to myself should I 
  c=
ut the wire before the green one I had cut or should I cut the wire 
  afte=
r the green one. Hmmmm, I thought here goes nothing so I cut the 
  yellow =
wire after the green one number eight from the top. I put it 
  together as=
 I was crossing my fingers, I tried the FM band and bingo 
  it worked grea=
t. Just a funny story of how electronically illiterate 
  I 
  am. I do wan=
t to say I do hear alot of voices coming across these 
  boxes. I hear them=
 saying their names and sometimes it sounds like 
  they are talking to eac=
h other. I have gotten answers to questions 
  too. Yesterday at my work pl=
ace I like to listen to it while I'm 
  working here at the Post Office. I =
heard a male voice say to me "Do 
  you want a Tech ?" I also hear the name=
 Lisa alot and they 
  say "seven" 
  alot too. My name has been called alo=
t too. So there has to be 
  something to these boxes. Oh I also had one sa=
y " Hurry dead battery "
  which my batteries did die a few minutes later w=
hich was cool. I was 
  recording with my voice recorder and picked that up=
. They say some 
  funny things sometimes too. I did hear one say to me " F=
__k Off " I 
  know that wasn't on any radio program LOl. Oh well you have =
a great 
  set up here and it is nice to meet you all. Take care and keep u=
p the 
  great work you all are doing in your researches. Bye for now !!

 =
 Regards,

  Ralph Smith of "SPIRIT" Paranormal Investigation Team !!!!
