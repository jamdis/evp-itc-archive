So, in this case, prejudice meant to\nalready be ready to hear what someone already described, rather than\nlistening before you have that information, and so can maximize your\nobjectivity.\n\nMaybe you could clarify what you meant by my viewpoint?

Now\n&gt; &gt; that everyone knows they are from a plane crash, that will set up the\n&gt; &gt; prejudice of hearing plane/travel related words in the evp noises.\n&gt; &gt; And as you probably know, once that prejudice is active, once I say\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Doesn&#39;t that sound like someone saying &quot;Sssssstewardesssss...&quot;, then\n&gt; &gt; everyone hears THAT word, rather than just noise, or, for example\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Stewed ass&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And, if something does sound like a plane/travel related word, it\n&gt; &gt; will now be highlighted as an example of why this was a successful\n&gt; &gt; test, and the other less-relevant words ignored. This is a form of\n&gt; &gt; confirmation bias, which again, hurts the value of the test.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A more objective way would have been to send out both crash related\n&gt; &gt; items, and completely innocuous items, with no explanation of where\n&gt; &gt; each was from, and see what kind of EVPs were returned on each.\n&gt; &gt; Further, the returned EVPs should then be returned to someone to\n&gt; &gt; evaluate who ALSO doesn&#39;t know the origin of the objects, so that\n&gt; &gt; they do not torture the interpretations into the forms you hope and\n&gt; &gt; expect them to be (again, plane/travel related). While this test of\n&gt; &gt; course lacks all kinds of controls, this would at least be a start to\n&gt; &gt; defining a double-blind test, which is the gold standard for good\n&gt; &gt; research in this kind of research.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Even though you have tried to keep some of the information quiet,\n&gt; &gt; there is still quite a large opportunity for guessing and\n&gt; &gt; coincidence. For example, one person might assume this was from an\n&gt; &gt; airshow (since, as you said, the event was very fast, and many people\n&gt; &gt; saw it), and so only send in EVPs that would be relevant to that\n&gt; &gt; situation (I.e. Not sending in child-like sounds, or sending in\n&gt; &gt; sounds that sound like scratchy tower or inter-plane\n&gt; &gt; communication). If the crash was a commercial airline, then dozens\n&gt; &gt; of different people could have been killed, which means you could\n&gt; &gt; find SOME relevancy no matter what noises are returned to you:\n&gt; &gt; practical any word, name, or sound will support some speculation that\n&gt; &gt; it could have been relevant to one of those people.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I do think it is a good idea to test your theories. But my purpose\n&gt; &gt; here is to suggest ways to help these tests be as objective as\n&gt; &gt; possible, and for your efforts and testing to be as worth while as\n&gt; &gt; possible, and for the youtube video results you make to be as\n&gt; &gt; valuable and bulletproof as possible. But I am concerned that the\n&gt; &gt; above scenario is full of opportunity for subjectivity and\n&gt; &gt; misinterpretation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
