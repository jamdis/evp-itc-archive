<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Dear all,

From my attempts at making a quick study of EVP-ITC via use of boxes 
in reading your extremely informative posts and listening to posted 
files, an obvious question arises (please indulge my technical 
ignorance here):  I understand these boxes work on scanning radio 
frequencies and that boxes have been created to scan AM, FM, and 
shortwave.  What about other frequencies, e.g., walkie-talkie 
channels (public, private and government), television broadcast 
channels, and all the in-between frequencies?  In other words, while 
scanning, for example, an AM channel, would it not be possible for 
the radio receiver to pick up another band, let&#x27;s say, short-wave?  
The reason I&#x27;m asking is that years ago I was dictating something 
into the hand-held mic of a cheap cassette tape recorder and imagine 
my surprise when in playing back what I&#x27;ve just dictated, instead of 
hearing just my voice, I also heard in the background a two-way 
conversation between truckers using their CB radios that my cheap mic 
had picked up while I was recording!

My point is even if we&#x27;re scanning only certain frequencies, can&#x27;t 
other frequencies bleed through and if so, perhaps this may be the 
reason for some of the non-sequitor responses picked by the boxes?

Another question:  Astronomers use scanning devices to pick up 
signals from outer space -- are their receivors constructed on 
basically the same principles as the radio receivers in the ITC 
boxes? 

Thanks everyone,
