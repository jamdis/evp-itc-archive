<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>hi, I gave the sweep tuning method a try today and captured what could 
have been random words but then again they could have been my mind 
trying to piece together random its of noise into words. I am used to a 
very different style of evp and usualy use goldwave to edit my 
recordings, can someone maybe misty that is more familiar describe step 
by step how to use this sweep method and what to look for, the words I 
heard were very mechanical and not human sounding at all. Any help is 
appreciated.
