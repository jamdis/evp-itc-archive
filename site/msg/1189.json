I made the box last week end, but have been working on \nbikes all week to try to get ready for summer. \n\n I&#39;ve had my group e-mail turned off cuz it&#39;s too tempting to spend \nendless hours e-mailing at work.\n\n I got started on a web site today, I want to run the content by others \nto make sure I&#39;m not being unduly insensitive to other researchers, as \nI&#39;m prone to do sometimes, before I publish it. \n\n Frank"}
