  Yes I did get the 12-820, and I didn't get very good reception with it.  For some reason I can't get myself away from the 12-469.  I have been getting some tremendous results with it. 
  If you have a 12-469, just give it a try, you'll get some results soon, or maybe you haven't got your EVP real-time communication ears yet.  It took me awhile to get mine, and still I miss some things.

Did you get the RS 12-820 yet? Wondering if it is working good for you.
I havent got anyone to talk to me on it yet.
