These contacts range from the 50&#39;s to the present with many of the original pioneers still being alive. A lot of the transcripts from these contacts can be found at Mark Macy and Rolf Erhardt&#39;s website called WorldITC.org. They have free books, papers, reviews and recordings of many of the spectacular contacts.\n\nKeep in mind these are not beliefs based on faith and hope, these are truths as seen through the senses (eyes) of the entities who are there. Based on my own contacts and the supporting transcripted contacts of the past, I will provide some short answers to some of your questions. Even though I am doing this, I would still like you to challenge my answers and find out for yourself. Keep in mind, these are not complete answer. They are just the tip of a limitless iceberg.\n\n&quot;Where do we go?&quot;\n\nWhere enter the &quot;afterlife&quot; depending on the amount of evolving we have done during our existence. Our vibration determines the level at which we are placed. This means the faster, lighter and more subtle our vibration the higher we enter. The lower, darker and denser our vibration the lower and closer to the Earth plane we enter. As they have told us though most people who have lived average decent lives will enter the 3rd Astral level they call Marduk or the river world.\n\n&quot;Is there a light?&quot;\n\nYes, there is a light and it is usually referred to as the source. The source is described to us as the source of all existence. If you could imagine the most pure, subtle, bright, white light ever experienced you would still not understand what it is and what it represents. On a very primordial level it represent god. On a higher more evolved level it represents full and total consciousness and it is the goal of all individual and joined beings.\n\n&quot;Do we meet with our loved ones, and can we see them in a physical form\nas we did when we were in our bodies, or do we just see light/energy\nand know it is them?&quot;\n\nThe short answer is yes. You will be met and helped by those who love you and those who you love. These can be people you have known in your previous life or those you knew before your previous life. They will be there to help you settle and transition into the existence of your new reality. Beware though, they may not be as you remember them in life. They will look as they did while at the peak of their life and so will you after your full transition and sleep.\n\n&quot;...what happens next? Can we eat food there? Drink a nice glass of wine\nthere? Enjoy a beer? Travel the globe and see all the tourist\nattractions on the planet? Can we travel and walk on the moon or other\nplanets? Can we dive in the worlds oceans, and visit old shipwrecks?&quot;\n\nThe world over there is not like Earth and the physical plane. The world is pliable energy. It can be arranged by thought and at a whim. Even though you don&#39;t have to, you can eat, drink, have sex (which is a little different) at your leisure. Not only can you come back and visit the Earth but there are an infinite number of worlds and dimensions to explore and there are explorers who already try to find those secrets and how to access those worlds.\n\n&quot;What is the purpose of our human life, and can we reincarnate again and how does that happen?&quot;\n\nThis may seem a little cryptic but it is meant to make you find the meaning. The purpose of human life is simply, the evolution of mind in matter. You can reincarnate as many times as you think it is necessary to learn what you feel you need to learn. From what we are told though is that you will always reincarnate as a human. You can&#39;t come back as an eagle, monkey or fish. Reincarnation is also, sometimes forced upon those who cannot adapt to the afterlife. These people usually have some kind of hangup with the physical plane, which is usually represented by fear and desire.\n\nOne of the big questions a lot of people ask and they find a lot of comfort in the answer is, what are we? To put it simply, we are an immortal part of a whole with limitless powers of creation. Creation is not something that has happened, it is something that is still happening.\n\nLike I said, please do not take my word for it. Make contact, ask questions and get your own answers. The answers I have given you are very basic and are only to illustrate a representation of reality we are not meant to understand as human beings. These are examples based on truth.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nFrank R.\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: Michael Edwards &lt;f1cracker75@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 10:04:39 PM\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Frank&#39;s Box #12\n\n                  \nHi I am new to the group.
