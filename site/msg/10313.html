<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Misty,

Can we just go to a file size limit?  Anything over 50 or 100kb has 
to be linked to?  This way we will cut down on the file strain 
without having to convert to mp3.  Many of the mp3 files are massive 
here.  My wav files are smaller...plus the mp3s don&#x27;t open up 
correctly for some of us.

I requested this yesterday, but it surely got lost in the fireworks.  
I have deleted some of my files, as well.

&gt; Deleting my files took it down about 3 percent, I noticed.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I have been sick and I&#x27;m plain worn down to a nub with all this
&gt; fighting.
&gt; 
&gt; I do appreciate you asking after me, Misty. 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ll be around.

&gt; &gt; Thanks Ann. I think going to more compacted files will help us 
all in 
&gt; &gt; the long run. We are already back to 72% rather than 96% tho most 
of 
&gt; &gt; the file space was being used by someone else besides you =)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I know it gets to be a bit testy around here and the other 
forums. I 
&gt; &gt; also know that some of the nastiness can tear apart good working 
&gt; &gt; relationships as well as friendships. I was just askin Frank if 
he 
&gt; &gt; knew if you were still sick or not because you had been very 
quiet 
&gt; &gt; lately.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I agree sometimes its good to take a step back rather than get 
&gt; &gt; yourself caught up in the drama fests going on around us all. 
Thats 
&gt; &gt; on and off the board as well. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As I said I know some of what goes on off of this forum, and I am 
sad 
&gt; &gt; to see most of it happening. I just hope everyone can regain 
focus 
&gt; &gt; and like you said, remember why we are here.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I hope you feel better soon, and rejoin us when the stress level 
is 
&gt; &gt; passed. And I hope it passes soon so ya can run some test 
sessions 
&gt; &gt; with the new tool that arrived!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I keep telling people that all the negativity does take a toll, 
on us 
&gt; &gt; personally and our working together.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Get a grip--all of you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m out of here until all this petty BS and hatred sorts out. 
The  
&gt; &gt; &gt; amount of stress that I&#x27;ve been through with all this fighting 
&gt; &gt; since  
&gt; &gt; &gt; early this year has really taken a toll on me as a person and 
a  
&gt; &gt; &gt; researcher. I&#x27;m going off line for awhile. If anyone wants to 
talk 
&gt; &gt; to  
&gt; &gt; &gt; me, send me a private e-mail because I&#x27;m going to read only/no 
e-
&gt; &gt; mail  
&gt; &gt; &gt; until I remember again why I used to wake up every day and want 
to  
&gt; &gt; &gt; run to my computer to see what would be posted.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Misty--as per your request, I&#x27;ve deleted my files.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
