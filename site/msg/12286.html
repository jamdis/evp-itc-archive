<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Mike, quick question...I have been experimenting with a multichannel
system inspired by your spiricomp system. Rather than adding the white
noise at the computer recording stage, I have a standalone dvd player
with a looping track. I have experimented with white and pink noise
tracks, but was just curious which you have had the most success with.
I also made a brown/red noise track, and wondered if you had
experimented with that at all. 

Thanks in advance, you work has been very helpful in getting me
started down this road.

Thanks,
Andy
