<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Occasionally that happens. Dont know why.

Usually just saving the file and opening it with audacity does the 
trick for me, or other file player besides win media player. I do not 
know why it has a conflict with some files I have seen different 
modes, stereo mono, and diff hz files that do not want to open in 
windows media player. Often a file you clipped beside it using same 
settings will open fine while the other dont.
