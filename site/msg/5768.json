You have a fascinating background.  Your experience hacking the =\r\nradios is similar to mine and is the reason I&#39;ve got two sitting here that =\r\nI&#39;m afraid to touch!  It sounds like you are well on your way to great succ=\r\ness and will have a lot to contribute to the group.\n\nRobin\n\n\n  ----- Origin=\r\nal Message ----- \n  From: ghostthostt&lt;mailto:Ralphsmi@...&gt; \n  To: E=\r\nVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n  Sent: Friday, Jan=\r\nuary 18, 2008 11:41 PM\n  Subject: [EVP-ITC] New member here !!\n\n\n  Hi all,\n=\r\n\n  I&#39;m a new member of the group and I am an Investigator of the \n  Paranor=\r\nmal here in central PA. My group&#39;s name is SPIRIT Paranormal \n  Investigati=\r\non Team. I have been doing this in groups now for 6 years.\n  I had my own g=\r\nroup H.I.P.S. (Harrisburg Independent Paranormal \n  Society) and now I am i=\r\nn the SPIRIT group out of Selinsgrove,PA. I \n  also use to be with Kelly We=\r\naver&#39;s group Capital Ghost Forum which is \n  now called Spirit Society of P=\r\nA. I had to leave her group because of \n  my work schedule. I have been on =\r\nGhost Investigations with TAPS to \n  Waverly Hills Sanatorium,Ky, Eastern S=\r\ntate Pennitentiary in PA. I \n  have \n  also investigated St. Augustine Ligh=\r\nthouse in Fla. I did have a \n  chance \n  to meet Bill Murphy here in Gettys=\r\nburg,PA. on the Battlefield near \n  the \n  Wheatfield last year for a short=\r\n time. He is a nice guy. I let him \n  listen to some of my EVP&#39;s from the W=\r\nheatfield and Triangular Field \n  that day we met. I have been called an &quot; =\r\nEVP Medium &quot; by my peers. I \n  have a ton of them. I would like to thank &quot;F=\r\nrank Sumption&quot; for his \n  inspiring work with his boxes and giving of his t=\r\nime and knowledge to \n  inspire us to do our own research to find the answe=\r\nrs we are all \n  looking for in this world. Thanks, Frank for your inspirat=\r\nion and \n  hard \n  work we all appreciate it. I would also like to thank &quot;S=\r\num Duck&quot; \n  and &quot;Mike Coletta&quot; for coming up with those Hacks that made it =\r\neasy \n  for me and all the others out there that are Electronically \n  illi=\r\nterate.\n  Thank you guys we all appreciate it too. Oh well I just wanted to=\r\n put \n  my two cents in to let you know I&#39;m with you all. Oh, I have two 12=\r\n-\n  469&#39;s the first one I broke trying to hack it LOL. The other one \n  wor=\r\nks \n  great. I also have the 12-470(old model) which I tried to hack but I =\r\n\n  cut the wrong wire. I cut the green wire (seventh wire from the top \n  a=\r\ns \n  Mike said to do)and when I put everything back together I had no AM \n =\r\n Band LOL. So I opened it up again and was thinking to myself should I \n  c=\r\nut the wire before the green one I had cut or should I cut the wire \n  afte=\r\nr the green one. Hmmmm, I thought here goes nothing so I cut the \n  yellow =\r\nwire after the green one number eight from the top. I put it \n  together as=\r\n I was crossing my fingers, I tried the FM band and bingo \n  it worked grea=\r\nt. Just a funny story of how electronically illiterate \n  I \n  am. I do wan=\r\nt to say I do hear alot of voices coming across these \n  boxes. I hear them=\r\n saying their names and sometimes it sounds like \n  they are talking to eac=\r\nh other. I have gotten answers to questions \n  too. Yesterday at my work pl=\r\nace I like to listen to it while I&#39;m \n  working here at the Post Office. I =\r\nheard a male voice say to me &quot;Do \n  you want a Tech ?&quot; I also hear the name=\r\n Lisa alot and they \n  say &quot;seven&quot; \n  alot too. My name has been called alo=\r\nt too. So there has to be \n  something to these boxes. Oh I also had one sa=\r\ny &quot; Hurry dead battery &quot;\n  which my batteries did die a few minutes later w=\r\nhich was cool. I was \n  recording with my voice recorder and picked that up=\r\n. They say some \n  funny things sometimes too. I did hear one say to me &quot; F=\r\n__k Off &quot; I \n  know that wasn&#39;t on any radio program LOl. Oh well you have =\r\na great \n  set up here and it is nice to meet you all. Take care and keep u=\r\np the \n  great work you all are doing in your researches. Bye for now !!\n\n =\r\n Regards,\n\n  Ralph Smith of &quot;SPIRIT&quot; Paranormal Investigation Team !!!!\n\n\n\n=\r\n   \r\n------=_NextPart_000_001F_01C85A55.20B5BB40\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3Dtext/html;charset=3Diso-8859-1&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16587&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY id=\r\n=3DMailContainerBody \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 10px; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FON=\r\nT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #000000; BORDER-TOP-STYLE: none; PADDING-TOP: 15px; FO=\r\nNT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; BORDER-RIGHT-STYLE: none; BORDER-LE=\r\nFT-STYLE: none; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; TEXT-DECORATION: none; BORDER-BO=\r\nTTOM-STYLE: none&quot; \nleftMargin=3D0 topMargin=3D0 acc_role=3D&quot;text&quot; CanvasTab=\r\nStop=3D&quot;true&quot; \nname=3D&quot;Compose message area&quot;&gt;&lt;!--[gte IE 5]&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace=\r\n prefix=3D&quot;v&quot; /&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix=3D&quot;o&quot; /&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Hi R=\r\nalph!&nbsp; You have&nbsp;a fascinating background.&nbsp; Your \nexperience =\r\nhacking the radios is similar to mine and is the reason I&#39;ve got two \nsitti=\r\nng here that I&#39;m afraid to touch!&nbsp; It sounds like you are well on your=\r\n \nway to great success and will have a lot to contribute to the group.&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Robin&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;B=\r\nLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px=\r\n; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2px solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT:=\r\n 10pt arial&quot;&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt=\r\n arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A \n  title=3Dmailto:Ralphsmi@... \n  href=3D&quot;m=\r\nailto:Ralphsmi@...&quot;&gt;ghostthostt&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10=\r\npt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A \n  title=3Dmailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n  href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;D=\r\nIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Friday, January 18, 2008 11:41 \n=\r\n  PM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; [EVP-ITC] New =\r\nmember here \n  !!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n  &lt;P&gt;Hi al=\r\nl,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I&#39;m a new member of the group and I am an Investigator of \n  the =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Paranormal here in central PA.
