The \n        AAEVP/Sarah=\r\n Estep Research Fund is not for AAEVP to do the research, \n        it&#39;s for=\r\n them to fund OUTSIDE organizations for THEIR scientific \n        research =\r\non the study of EVP. The Windbridge Institute received some of \n        thi=\r\ns sponsor money for what they called &quot;Real-time EVP Conversations: A \n     =\r\n   Pilot Study.&quot; The method for this communication was *not* based on radio=\r\n \n        sweep, nor traditional methods, so it&#39;s not based on what I assum=\r\ne many \n        people here are doing. And in fact, it *was* based on the c=\r\nreations of \n        someone outside of the USA, so I&#39;m a little confused a=\r\ns to why all the \n        hostility toward AAEVP for putting up the money.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sadly, radio \n        sweep methods don&#39;t, and may not for a long ti=\r\nme, get the respect of the \n        scientific community that it deserves (=\r\nthen again, seems no form of EVP \n        does), but at least this current =\r\nresearch is a step in the right \n        direction. I hope, when Windbridge=\r\n concludes their study, that it will \n        support the notion that there=\r\n is apparent communication formed in ways \n        that cannot be explained=\r\n by currently known and understood laws of \n        nature. THAT alone, in =\r\nmy opinion, would be a big plus for all ITC \n        communities, regardles=\r\ns of the method from which that communication was \n        received. What&#39;s=\r\n the old saying? &quot;It takes but one white crow to prove \n        all crows a=\r\nre not black.&quot; Any proof, derived from any EVP method, would \n        be gr=\r\neatly welcomed as far as I&#39;m concerned.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Margaret \n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; \n        target=3D_b=\r\nlank&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;, Frank Sumption \n        &lt;purpleal=\r\niengirl@&lt;WBR&gt;...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It&#39;s the same \n        old stuf=\r\nf, everyone wants to completely ignore absolutely all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n        work=\r\n that has been in this field since the caveman and act like they \n        j=\r\nust&lt;BR&gt;&gt; discovered spirit and EVP.
