There are tricksters even in the spirit world :) Seems like I need to upload the file &quot;Mikes Dead&quot; as my link for that download doesn&#39;t work. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I imagine that with mediumship as well as evp its all just &quot;interesting&quot; bits of info until someone can confirm the information coming thru as concrete evidence. I also imagine theres a long line of people attempting contact with MJ at this very moment and attempting confimation thru other avenues like you are. Maybe wait a bit then try again and perhaps they will respond to your messages. Keep us informed Bonnie!\n&gt; \n&gt; I think Jim is more excited he got a response to his question than anything. (Yayyy Jim!) It is very exciting work! I also know that often information is given for family in grief that has little to do with us. I dont always understand the information or weird nicknames are given that seem irrelevant to me but to the family member its means everything and makes perfect sense. They never cease to amaze me with the confirmations that there is more to life after the body passes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Spirit has ways of making sure the messages get thru to the right person at the right time. The method they choose to use is up to them and isn&#39;t always whatI expect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt;"}
