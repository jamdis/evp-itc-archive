<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Same ole same ole we&#x27;ve seen it many many mannnny times. 

I dont know why people are always so conflictive in groups either. I 
have watched you (and others)leave the group scene a few times over 
the years because of disagreements or just tired of the BS. I think 
sooner or later we all feel like there is no hope for the group 
atmosphere and we need a break from it. However I have also seen alot 
of productive ideas and some good things that do come with connecting 
with others some of who think like we do.

I still think its important ya stay active and speak up for yourself 
and your own work rather than let others put words in your mouth. 
It&#x27;s really the only reason I didnt just shut the thing down when you 
quit before.

At least while its open your opinions are available to the public 
rather than all of the false misinformation being sold to the world.

And for those wondering, NO I wasn&#x27;t involved in those old disputes 
either. And I dont blame ya for stepping away and taking the breaks 
ya have. I probably told ya to once or twice myself before you 
started this group.

It gets to be overwhelming and I know why ya dont want to be owner.

Nobody runs this group. The group runs itself. Sometimes better than 
others. Sometimes not.

&gt;  I didn&#x27;t read any resulting posts from what I posted earlier, and 
I&#x27;m not sure I want to. I&#x27;ve been doing this for some years now, and 
it seems like ya can&#x27;t go two weeks without someone that thinks they 
know more, or their &quot;theories&quot; are more valid, or someone that 
believes for whatever reason they are the box/EVP/paranormal expert. 
I&#x27;ve had enough, these groups are pointless, and I&#x27;m tired of the BS. 
There is always these incessant arguements with those that seem to 
think they know better than anyone else. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, and my 
over reactions, but at this point, I don&#x27;t care, enough is enough. So 
ya want the group? I don&#x27;t actually own it due to one of these 
idiotic arguements, but have at it, cuz I ain&#x27;t playing this game 
anymore. I&#x27;ll continue my own work, in my own time, and in my own 
way.
