Tell yourself whatever makes you feel better or whatever allows you to slee=
p at night. Also, you may want to research into Tesla a bit more. He did no=
t die poor! He died while living in an upscale hotel (the New Yorker) in NY=
, NY. Immediately after his death, all of his belongings, papers and resear=
ch were confiscated by the US government. The debt's that were attributed t=
o him (and the reason why people thought he was poor) were with the very ma=
n that ruined his reputation, George Westinghouse.

Thank you, Frank!  There=

 for both.  One was more brilliant than the other,  in turn the less brilli=

a "Capitalist" ,  he devoted his time and efforts to "bettering the lives o=
f mankind".  The lessor was indeed a "Capitalist" ,  his motives were less =
noble,  however,  and he was willing to "better" mankind,  too,  but make a=
 good profit in the process.  We all know the story...one is foremost in th=
e eyes of the general
 public,  became personally rich and famous,  while t=
he other died broke and without fanfare.  A shame,  but factual,  none-the-=

y want without recompense?  I think not.  I certainly wouldn't!  Get real. =

          I realize the time=

 but if you are taking on the duty of spreading the technology to help mank=

You ga=

Honestly, I know it is none of my business wha=
