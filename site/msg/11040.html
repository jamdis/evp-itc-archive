I have had a few instances of an Edward popping in. First time was in 2006 last time was last month during group session =)
   
  No last name on that guy yet tho. But I do find some of the other things said in that session to be of interest in part because they talked about speaking to you this year. I was gonna post this to group but files are a bit over limit of attachments so just sending in private. I think you have a couple already since they were about you.
