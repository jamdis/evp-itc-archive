Steve, I do try to be skeptical. But just to clear things up here, I've nev=
er said that I believed that real time spirit communication is not possible=
. =A0 While many people here bring skills in electronics to this field, I t=
ry to help out in the area of process and methodology. =A0 I think=A0 a lot=
 of attention has been put on the equipment, and on the efforts to collect =
data.=A0 And that's great.=A0 My opinion is that less has been put on proce=
ss and methodology, which I feel is just as important, and can be just as d=
ifficult, as the other areas.=A0 Part of that is interpretation of the data=
, which is generally where you'll find me trying to add value to the conver=
sation or commenting on the techniques I see.

If you would like me to comm=
ent on your other files, I'd be happy too.=A0 But I'll leave that call up t=
o you.
