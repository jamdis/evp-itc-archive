=
=C2=A0 
I have a legal question that I cannot seem to find an answer to. I =
recently went on an investigation to a public place with a=C2=A0 paranormal=
 group. While my experience is much less than theirs, I found them to be to=
o disorganized. Three people=C2=A0came from the group. One had no equipment=
 and the second used his cell phone.=C2=A0I never even saw a pencil.=C2=A0S=
o, I started a small group, specifically for=C2=A0amateur investigators sta=
ying in local public places so we don't get in over our heads. We aren't tr=
ying to get any resident investigations and are non competitive. On our sit=
e I put photos and evps I had gotten while on the investigation and put at =
the bottom that some evidence was obtained while on investigations with oth=
er groups. I didn't use any of their names. As with any of my photos, I blo=
cked out any faces, and it was all on my equipment. I signed nothing and ag=
reed to nothing.
Yesterday he sent me an email saying he wants it taken dow=
n. It's technically and legally his ( technically and legally?). If I wante=
d to start my own group all I had to do was ask. He has said that I invited=
 a 16 year old to join the group (Definitely didn't). And that he thought I=
 would join their group.
-I don't believe he's right on the legal issue. Et=
hically, I would have accredited the group if he was more diplomatic and ma=
ybe even taken it down. 
- wouldn't making false accusations make him guilt=
y of liable?
- I don't need to ask him to do ****. I've met him twice.

Doe=
s anybody know of any place where I can find something written on the law a=
bout those photos and media being mine.
