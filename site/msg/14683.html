copper is a great conductor

I bought a transformer at Gateway Electronics in St. Louis some  years ago 
that looked like a great transformer for a high-current 12 volt  supply. The 
secondary appeared to be wound with #8 enameled wire. I found out  the 
secondary was wound with aluminum wire. After I built the power  supply and 
tried to get 20 amps from it but couldn't, I gave up on it and got  another 
transformer wound with copper wire.

 What if that house has aluminum wire?

Thanks! Would that account for the  tapping noise?

Yes.  Also faulty wiring, which is even more  dangerous.
Also with flakey transformers or other power  distribution in the area, or 
power lines.
Perhaps you can check  with some neighbors, and see how their power is  
doing.

Hi All,
 
Is there someone here that  can answer and electrical question for me?
 
During the case that I  recorded those possible EVP's-there was a loud 
tapping noise  that seemed to come from the 2nd bedroom. Upon checking my logs,  
every time one of  these clicks were heard, there would be  an EMF spike in 
the livingroom. The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the  livingroom downstairs. 
The home owners have also reported that  they have a touch lamp that comes on 
all the time by itself and  the lights in the Kitchen will dim occasionally.
 
Now these taps are not  consistent in timing, loudness or rhythm. Could 
this be the work  of faulty breakers?
 
Thanks!
April
