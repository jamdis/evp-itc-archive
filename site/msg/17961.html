for having a different opinion of people's results, I  think you =

understand why I will not post my name and address  here.

Try anyway=
 though.  I don't know how your personal  beliefs here work, but 
others se=
em to get messages about people they've  never heard of, or places 
they've=

I would also  suggest anyone who tries this experiment, to po=
st your 
results on the  list here rather than sending them personally to m=
e - so I won't 
be  accused of losing any.

All you have to do is ask your boxes/spirits/  aliens/etc, what it is.

I have taken a picture of it, and  posted it to the files section here, so =

there is no way I can squirm  out of the results:

Please do not try to=
  open the file before noon Wednesday. But feel free to 
download it to  yo=

it  during, or a=

Answers anyone reveals after noon  Wednesday don't count. =
Partial answers

Best of Luck. I hope for this to be a=

I hope we all can learn from the res=
ults.
