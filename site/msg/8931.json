That&#39;s insane! Well, if people are paying for it, then more\n&gt; power to &#39;em.\n\nOn ebay.de I saw one for ï¿œ25 (about ï¿œ40), what is still expensive for\nsuch an old and low-quality device.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve been wanting to try the Raudive method with a germanium diode.\n&gt; Radio shack only carries silicon, so I&#39;ll have to order the germanium\n&gt; and give it a shot.\n\nYou could also try a schottky diode which is more sensitive than a\ngerman diode.
