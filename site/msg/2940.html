I put some video up n my folder on the group, now everyone can see I am ve=
ry far from being a real Princess, at least on this level. Just a scruffy o=
ld goat.
 
 The camera works, and solves some problems, but it's POS, with =
poor audio. I think I can fix the audio, and maybe make a line adapter so b=
ox audio can be fed in directly. The mic was in the back of the camera, so =
I cut a hole in the front, and brought it out by the lens, that helped a mi=
niscule amount.
