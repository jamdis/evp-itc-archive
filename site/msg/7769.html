<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Everyone,
I recently purchased the 470 and did the hack. Scans perfectly, but 
I&#x27;m having trouble with training my ears. We have so many radio 
stations in SE Florida. We have Florida, Cuba, Haiti and all those 
other Islands, that there is little breaks on the F.M. and A.M. 
stations. 

I use the hack with a mixer, digital recorder (sometimes straight to 
computer), and microphone. When I first did the hack, before taping 
my sessions, I did make contact with a Tech called &quot;Frank&quot;. I know 
it&#x27;s not Frank S, but my father, who passed 2 years ago is a Frank as 
well, I had to ask if he was Francis Joseph Carr, reply was no. I got 
so freaked that I closed the portal. Later that day, I tried again, 
got a tech who said his name was Reed. I wanted to test the system bc 
I wasn&#x27;t believing my ears, so I asked him to read a name I was 
writing on a piece of paper. As I was writing my name, John, he said 
it before I got to complete the &quot;n&quot;. I got no nervous, I asked to 
close the portal, and wait till it was clear, then shut down.

 The next day, I set up to record my session, which it didn&#x27;t go as 
well. So much radio signals, that I could hear the tech. I kept on 
asking, &quot;Can you repeat your name?&quot;, and I got fustrated with all the 
sounds coming from the RS 470. I know, if I was on the other side 
that I would have been pissed. Upon listening to the recording, I 
found out his name was Pete. When I asked to repeat, he said, &quot;I 
Did&quot;. I asked for a test of the systems, he said, &quot;maybe&quot;. I asked to 
repeat &quot;Dragonfly&quot;, I heard, very weak, &quot;ragon...fly&quot;.

I&#x27;ve been doing investigations in haunted invironments since 1998. I 
do EVPs with digital recorders in the haunted area. This RS Hack is 
being done in my home, which isn&#x27;t haunted, except if you call my 
father&#x27;s visits a haunt, which I don&#x27;t. On the time of first session 
after the hack, I heard my wall start to make a sound like there was 
moving furniture behind the wall. I went to look, nothing was moving. 
Looked outside, nothing outside. 

I know about closing the portal and asking everyone to leave and give 
them a chance to go through. Can a spirit stay if they want to, even 
though you don&#x27;t? Does techs get pissed off when our side doesn&#x27;t 
hear well? Is there a way to squelch the stations that are coming 
through, I hear everyone elses sessions and they are less noisey than 
mine, can I reduce the noise? 

I&#x27;m not a electrical tech, and a definately not as talented as Frank 
Sumption, which I regard as expert in this new technology. I do have 
passion though, and hope my efforts will help those on the otherside 
and our side figure out a way to get some serious applications done. 

Many of the EVPs I get are, &quot;Help Me&quot;, which saddens me. I have an 
investigation coming up soon, where a fireman was killed on his 
second week of working at the firestation. He died in 1940. His 
accident, might have not been an accident. Upon going to a fire, we 
fell into a puddle that had a downed wire. He died minutes later and 
now haunts the firestation. Some Clairvoyants think he was pushed out 
of the truck into the puddle as a joke, since he was new. They didn&#x27;t 
know about the wire. 

I would love to use the RS Hack, but afraid that people would think 
I&#x27;m crazy, that I&#x27;m only finding words to match what I want to hear.
I hear ya&#x27;lls session and mine are, well, just have too much stuff in 
the background.

Am I going crazy?
