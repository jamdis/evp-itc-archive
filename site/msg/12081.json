Up front I am skeptical of box \nrelated ITC, however, that being said I am also very curious. It would \nbe hard to argue contextually accurate results, regardless of methods \nused. I am looking forward to putting my new shack-hack to use, and \nwill keep everyone updated :)\n\nBtw, my name is Andy, 30 something, live in Oklahoma, and look forward \nto a great wealth of info from this group. I have a lot of info here to \ndigest, so off I go.\n\nregards,\nAndy"}
