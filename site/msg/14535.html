<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thought these comments might be interesting in light of recent
threads. Dr. Sam El-Khazen recently published an article in the
 Journal of Neuroquantology (study of brain function at the quantum
 mechanical level). In this paper entitled &quot;DNA The Gateway to
 Time&quot;, El-Khazen talks about the relationship between the structure
 of DNA, time, conscious perception and gravity. There is credible
 evidence that these are intimately correlated. 

An important finding for this group has to do with how we may in
 fact detect external influences in the physical world. If El-Khazen
 has it right, two EM waves must align in order for the preception
 process to even begin. If this does not happen, there is nothing to
 perceive, even though we may be impacted by an external potentially
 influencing EM wave. The second wave is generated from borrowed
 energy within our brain cells and is modelled upon the structure of
 DNA strands. So yes we are impacted by billions of EM signals per
 second but we actually detect only a small portion of these that we
 later process in the late-stage perceptual processes. 

This would nicely explain why two people would perceive events
 differently despite the fact that they were literally side by side
 witnessing the same event. Again this is strictly a matter of
 random probability, it seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with
 volition or intention. That is more the focus of the later
 perceptual processing which is in turn dependent upon this
 probabilistic process.

This could also explain why it is that EVP and ITC signals are
 perceived differently by different people even when no physical
 alteration to the media has occurred and why different things are
 heard more easily at different times by the same person.</pre>
