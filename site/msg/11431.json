It incorporates a\n&gt; speaker and \n&gt; is able to sweep AM, FM and shortwave.  The simple\n&gt; procedure is on my \n&gt; site.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.keyportparanormal.com/simpleghostboxhack.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Other models that are available for the hack are as\n&gt; follows:\n&gt; \n&gt; 12-469 (New Model White)---Pull the Mute pin off the board\n&gt; once \n&gt; opened.\n&gt; \n&gt; 20-125 --- Cut wire on ribbon going to the &quot;Mute&quot;\n&gt; markings on the \n&gt; board.\n&gt; \n&gt; 12-820 --- Cut wire going to &quot;Mute&quot; on the board\n&gt; \n&gt; 12-150 --- Cut Wire going to &quot;Mute&quot; on the board.\n&gt;  This is my latest \n&gt; find and is a bit harder to get at the wiring, but can be\n&gt; done.  It \n&gt; also incorporates a built in speaker.\n&gt; \n&gt; 12-469 and 12-820 will need an external speaker, but they\n&gt; come with \n&gt; earbuds.  I use a 21-549 speaker from radio shack, it works\n&gt; well and \n&gt; is fairly inexpensive.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Misty&quot;\n&gt; &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Angela\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LOL! Why dont they just give the winning lotto numbers\n&gt; that would \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; easier to aquire =)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Personally I never seek to prove this to anyone, they\n&gt; should \n&gt; &gt; prove/disprove it themselves. Even amongst those who\n&gt; arent \n&gt; skeptics, \n&gt; &gt; hearing varies. Sometimes everyones hears the same\n&gt; sometimes they \n&gt; &gt; dont. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also dont ask about lotto numbers LOL I dont play\n&gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As for building one yourself, most are trying out the\n&gt; radio \n&gt; &gt; modifications like the 12-470 or the 12-469 (horrible\n&gt; clicking on \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; 469 model but a few have gotten around it. Theres a\n&gt; few others \n&gt; Frank \n&gt; &gt; and Steve have messed with. I think ones the 12-125\n&gt; but I am a bit \n&gt; &gt; tired so all the model numbers arent popping in my\n&gt; head at the \n&gt; moment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A few &quot;how to&quot; videos have been posted on\n&gt; youtube. You can type in \n&gt; &gt; the model numbers to access a few of Mike\n&gt; Colletta&#39;s (ufogeek)\n&gt; &gt; available posts as well as several others who have\n&gt; made thier video \n&gt; &gt; instructions available online. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I did try out a fan test session the other day. Tho\n&gt; they werent as \n&gt; &gt; loud as with water, I could still discern a few\n&gt; statements. They \n&gt; were \n&gt; &gt; so &quot;bass&quot; in tone that its almost out of my\n&gt; hearing range on a few \n&gt; so \n&gt; &gt; I didnt post them all. As for the ones I did they can\n&gt; be found on \n&gt; my \n&gt; &gt; esnips \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.esnips.com/web/MiscellaneousMethodsofEVP\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That should take ya to the right folder\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Misty\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com,\n&gt; &quot;earthangel5998&quot; &lt;harris5998@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi everyone, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure lots of you know who James Randi is,\n&gt; the skeptic who \n&gt; &gt; offers $1 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; million for proof of the paranormal. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am wondering why there hasn&#39;t been an EVP\n&gt; demonstration good \n&gt; &gt; enough \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to win the prize. I have never captured an EVP,\n&gt; but many people \n&gt; &gt; have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; including those in this group. I cannot say (like\n&gt; James Randi \n&gt; &gt; &gt; apparently and others like him) that I think\n&gt; every person who \n&gt; &gt; captured \n&gt; &gt; &gt; an EVP is a fraud or captured a fluke or\n&gt; something like that. I \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; think that at all, it appears to me that many of\n&gt; them are the \n&gt; real \n&gt; &gt; &gt; deal, of that I am almost 100% certain and will\n&gt; be 100% certain \n&gt; if \n&gt; &gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; can ever capture my own. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know a lot about James Randi or EVP\n&gt; for that matter, but \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a question that came up. Can anyone enlighten me?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I tried a few sessions last night but came up\n&gt; empty handed. I am \n&gt; &gt; &gt; starting to think my white noise isn&#39;t loud\n&gt; enough. I&#39;m going to \n&gt; &gt; keep \n&gt; &gt; &gt; trying. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also I hope to experiment with ITC images. And\n&gt; soon I want to \n&gt; build \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;box&quot; which I keep hearing so much\n&gt; about. I don&#39;t know the \n&gt; first \n&gt; &gt; &gt; thing about these ghost/spirit boxes as I&#39;ve\n&gt; heard them called, \n&gt; all \n&gt; &gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; know is I want to learn to build one and use it\n&gt; as I&#39;ve heard \n&gt; some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting audio files here. But that&#39;s\n&gt; probably a good subject \n&gt; &gt; for a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; separate post unless anyone can give me an\n&gt; informative how-to \n&gt; link \n&gt; &gt; or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; anything. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Angela\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;"}
