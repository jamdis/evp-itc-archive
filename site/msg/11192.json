That would be nice to switch SD cards from time to time. \nEspecially if one had a great EVP. \n&gt; How does listening to EVP&#39;s make you feel about the dead? This is \nnot meant to be a theological argument in any way. Just a \nquestion...I am a medium, and I approach the subject as a medium. But \nthen I am involved with being a medium daily. \n&gt; \n&gt; Al, thank YOU for your honest and kind reply. I appreciate your \ntaking the time out of your busy day to reply to me. The time and \neffort does not make typing easy for you. \n&gt; Blessings,\n&gt; (The Other...) Al\n&gt; \n&gt; Al, this is the other Al, heh. I like the Olympus and have three of \nthem and one Sony. IMHO the Olympus beats Sony hands down. Model WS-\n300M is my favorite. I believe it runs 24-hours -- I use it for \novernight evps in houses and have captured very clear sounds. It is \nstereo and snaps apart to convert into a memory stick complete with \nusb. You can store data/text files and music, and the tiny speaker is \nexcellent. This thing is so light a good Cuban cigar weighs more. I \nbelieve these go for $150 or so, but I got this one new on ebay for \n$65. Another good one I use all the time is Olympus VN-960PC, which \nmay not be in mfg. any more. It records about 16 hours and is \nslightly larger, but has a darn good mike and I like the clip for the \nshirt pocket. Also it has a lighted display (as does the ws-300m) \nthhat&#39;s larger than the other one, consequently with bigger figures \nfor easier reading. You didn&#39;t ask for this, but the one I&#39;d avoid is \nthe Sony icd-st25. The sound is nowhere near true and though it has \nmost of the features of the Olympus models the sound quality is first \nin my book. I think all of these are available at wally world, \ncostco, and circuit city, though you can usually save a lot at ebay \nif you&#39;re patient.\n&gt; \n&gt; Al\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Threadsintyme@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: &quot;Al&quot; &lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Hello...from a Newbie\n&gt; Date: Tue, 03 Jun 2008 00:27:44 -0000\n&gt; \n&gt; My name is Al and I am interested in purchasing some digital voice \n&gt; recorders...what do all of you believe is the best model number to \nuse?\n&gt; \n&gt; Al\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Netscape.
