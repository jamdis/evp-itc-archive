This could include discarnate agents. \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; When you carefully consider \n  what is being heard, the the=\r\nmes often seem to reflect what may be subconscious \n  concerns of the opera=\r\ntor or the listener. If external sources additionally \n  inform this proces=\r\ns of perception, it is quite possible they influence both \n  what is record=\r\ned and how is later perceived. This would also nicely explain \n  why some p=\r\neople hear the same things on a recording while others hear quite \n  differ=\r\nent things and more importantly while one person hears different things \n  =\r\nfrom the same recording at different times.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; It would also remove the requirement that discarnates ma=\r\nnifest \n  the phenomena. If discarnates are indeed non-physical, it is uncl=\r\near how they \n  would modify the physical world. On the other hand, we have=\r\n good evidence \n  demonstrating the ability of living individuals to alter =\r\ntheir environments in \n  profound ways, apparently with their minds. So it =\r\nseems to make more sense \n  that this might indeed by the underlying mechan=\r\nism to EVPs rather than \n  discarnate manipulations.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- \n  In &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;, \n  &quot;mrscaptainjack2&quot; &lt;jjkamp@&=\r\ngt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m \n  wondering if a haunting-type s=\r\nituation such as yours would be different from \n  talking to your ancestors=\r\n four or five generations back?
