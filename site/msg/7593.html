Sounds interesting.  It would seem to me that if you want to pick up ALL random messages and not miss anything, then this would not be the way to go.  However, if it has potential to be used effectively for questions and CLEAR answers, now yer talkin.  ron l

This box, instead of sweeping incrementally (ex. 92.5, 92.7. 92.9, 
93.1, etc) up or down the band, scans the FM band, only jumping to 
the next strong signal (ex: 92.5, then to 94.1, then to 94.9, etc). 
It is odd to get used to, as it has a delay sometimes between audio 
bits. The box is fitted with a scan rate adjustment knob (so you 
can speed it up, or slow it down) and knobs to adjust the range of 
the band (you can narrow or widen the scanning). 

The issue is if this will work effectively or not, as the audio may 
be more clear, but am I missing a ton of messages in between? Am I 
getting combinations of undesirable disc jockey verbage, etc? 

Not sure, yet, so I am experimenting with it some more. If it does 
not prove, out then I will look to go with an incremental sweep. :)
