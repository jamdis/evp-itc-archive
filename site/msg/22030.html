&gt;  Almost 900 members and zero discussion. I see poeple join all the time
&gt; saying they want to learn--then nothin&#x27;. Probly better off on Face Book.
&gt;
&gt;  Part of it is that no matter what one says, there is an expert that knows
&gt; better, someone to tell you what your EVPs really say.
&gt;
&gt;  I don&#x27;t do investigations, and remain kinda skeptical aoubt hauntings and
&gt; just how much &quot;evidence&quot; is suggestion or expectation.  I do know ya do not
&gt; have to go to the huanted hot spot to get spirit communications.

&gt;&gt;    Hello everyone! My name is Beth and I am new to this group! Thank you
&gt;&gt; to the owners/moderators who approved my membership! I was looking for a
&gt;&gt; group of paranormal investigators who enjoy talking about the paranormal as
&gt;&gt; much as I do. My family and friends seem to be sick of me talking about it
&gt;&gt; and whenever I mention something that I&#x27;ve captured I get the roll of the
&gt;&gt; eyes. Lol!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve always been interested in ghost and ghost hunting. When I was little
&gt;&gt; my mother would tell me that she would always hear boxes being thrown around
&gt;&gt; in the basement and thought it to be a ghost. She also said that she would
&gt;&gt; hear footsteps and feet being dragged across the long plastic runner that we
&gt;&gt; had in front of the basement door. She would get up thinking it was one of
&gt;&gt; us kids and we would be sound asleep. So, naturally my interest grew. I
&gt;&gt; never seen anything unusual but I would always &#x27;feel&#x27; something in that
&gt;&gt; house. When I got older, married, and had my own kids I lived in a
&gt;&gt; questionable house for 11 years. We would hear footsteps in the attic, the
&gt;&gt; kids would complain of seeing &#x27;uncle Sam&#x27; standing in the bathroom doorway,
&gt;&gt; or a man walking through the bedroom. Of course I never believed them. I
&gt;&gt; asked my son when he got older and he remembered the man in great detail.
&gt;&gt; Turns out it was a man/spirit in period clothing with a long white beard and
&gt;&gt; top hat. Hence the &#x27;uncle Sam&#x27; character. I have seen a female child
&gt;&gt; apparition standing in the doorway to which I had a witness, my
&gt;&gt; sister-in-law who saw the same thing at the same time. We thought it was one
&gt;&gt; of our kids and quickly counted heads and it wasn&#x27;t one of our own. The
&gt;&gt; apparition vanished and we never saw it again. I have heard music playing in
&gt;&gt; the basement and a man coughing when I&#x27;ve been home alone. A roommate of
&gt;&gt; mine had her shirt tugged on and she thought it was me but I wasn&#x27;t home
&gt;&gt; from work yet. She locked herself in her room, scared to death until I came
&gt;&gt; home. The stories go on and on.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I moved from that home and now I am having strange things occur in this
&gt;&gt; house. I should note that I am over a thousand miles from my previous
&gt;&gt; &#x27;haunted&#x27; home. I&#x27;ve lived here 4 yrs and one day I seen a little ball of
&gt;&gt; light (ORB) shoot out of my bedroom and go into my husband&#x27;s chair. I have
&gt;&gt; seen a few shadows and have felt that creepy feeling where my hair stands on
&gt;&gt; end many times. So, I decided to get a digital recorder. Not thinking that I
&gt;&gt; would ever capture anything. I also wanted to use it to debunk EVPs and find
&gt;&gt; some Scientific explanation for them. I was wrong. I captured my first EVP
&gt;&gt; in the master bedroom of my home. It said, &quot;I have no love&quot;. Ok, that got my
&gt;&gt; attention. I tried to debunk it and could not. I decided to perform many EVP
&gt;&gt; sessions in my bedroom and have caught a lot of them. I have asked questions
&gt;&gt; and ask to knock for yes to certain questions. By doing so I figured out
&gt;&gt; that it was a Hispanic woman who had been murdered. After some research I
&gt;&gt; have since found out that yes someone had died in this house. One of the
&gt;&gt; previous tenants claimed there was a ghost here and even went so far as to
&gt;&gt; get the house cleansed. I must have brought it back by summoning it while
&gt;&gt; conducting my EVP sessions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My fascination grew now that I was actually capturing real evidence. I
&gt;&gt; have since went on tours of supposedly haunted places such as: Vulture Mine,
&gt;&gt; Arizona, The Bird Cage Theatre Tombstone, Arizona, the San Carlos Hotel,
&gt;&gt; Phoenix, and Goldfield Ghost Town, Arizona. I am new at this so I haven&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; been on any investigations on a team. I do it alone. The only equipment that
&gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve been using is a digital camera and recorder. My main interest is
&gt;&gt; capturing something paranormal on film or EVPs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have recently made a couple of trips to a local cemetery, during the
&gt;&gt; day, middle of the afternoon and have caught amazing EVPs. I have captured
&gt;&gt; many different voices and personalities. Some nice, some not so nice. Some
&gt;&gt; women, men, and children. It amazes me because I cannot debunk them. I know
&gt;&gt; for a fact that I&#x27;m the only one there so they can&#x27;t be explained. I know it
&gt;&gt; wasn&#x27;t me who I was hearing, so who is it? I&#x27;m not sure if ghosts really
&gt;&gt; exist or if they are all residual energy. Since capturing the voices
&gt;&gt; actually answering my questions I am leaning toward that they really exist.
&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s just no denying. I now believe that some are residual and some are
&gt;&gt; intelligent spirits. I enjoy EVPs because they are much harder to debunk.
&gt;&gt; With photographs there is always that &#x27;what if&#x27; or well it could be a glare
&gt;&gt; or a glitch in the camera. But with EVPs they are unmistakable.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m looking forward with getting to know everyone and sharing my
&gt;&gt; experiences.
