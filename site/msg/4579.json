I was talking\nwith a friend about EVPs last night, and she mentioned this forum\nwhich I&#39;d not heard of before. I&#39;m really looking forward to reading\nthrough the posts and seeing/listening to your evidence. \n\nI just took a quick look at some photos, which reminded me of what I&#39;d\nseen on the Scole Experiment book. Doing a search on the word &quot;Scole&quot;\nin the forum turned up lots of results. I&#39;m so excited to be in\ncontact with people who have actually even HEARD of the Scole\nexperiments! It makes me feel like some of the predictions or messages\nreceived in the Scole communications are coming to fruition [as far as\nthat as a world-wide growing awareness of ITC and the possibilities it\nrepresents].\n\nI&#39;m constantly surprised by the opportunities for connections and\nknowledge that turn up during my constant quest for answers.\n\nI hope I can contribute something worthwhile to this forum!\n\nDeb T."}
