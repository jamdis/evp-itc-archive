<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Those of you who have contacted entities claiming to be dead people, what is the oldest person you&#x27;ve spoken to (in terms of how long ago they died)?

I&#x27;m wondering because my great uncle has been coming through a lot, and he was murdered in 1942.  Since I wasn&#x27;t born until decades later, I never knew him, but I do understand that people come through we did not know in life.  Has anyone else contacted someone claiming to have lived that far back?  Or in another lifetime entirely?</pre>
