Jeff,
Do you know what the paranormal puck is? Is it the same thing?
How di=
d you know about this Ovilus 1 before it was on Paranormal State?
Do- you -=
know-someone? Or are you involved in the making of this?
And what NEW TOYS =
are out there that we don't know about?
I have alot of questions don't I ? =
Can't help it........
You can sell it on ebay...... Why would you want to g=
et rid of it
though, if it
works?

Hi Elabeth,
 
You have to remem=
ber much of what the Ovilus 1 said probably ended up on
the editing room fl=
oor.  But it does work.  I get great responses from
mine.  The (7) differen=
t modes on it work very well.  But if you know
anyone who wants one please =
let me know.  I was informed I have to sell
some of my toys to afford to bu=
y new toys...LOLOL  I would sell it for
$165.00 and it is in brand new cond=
ition and only used a few times.
