There =\r\nis no way for me to tell for certain as it is just too feint. I can&#39;t make =\r\nout any clear words. Sure-I could probably matrix some in, but that is all =\r\nit would be.\n\n    For an EVP to be considered proof positive of spirit comm=\r\nunication by the community at large, it has to be clear enough that many pe=\r\nople hear the same thing, without hints or coaxing. If you have to have hig=\r\nh quality devices to make it out, it just isn&#39;t good enough. That does not =\r\nmean it isn&#39;t a true EVP, just that it isn&#39;t good enough to stand as eviden=\r\nce.\n\n    As for the whistle, it sounded like feedback to me as well, but I =\r\nwill have to take you word for it that you were no where near any other ele=\r\nctronics or EMF&#39;s that could contribute to feedback.

If you can&#39;t hear them then it must be either=\r\n mechanical (sound card or headphones)or maybe your hearing has loss in tho=\r\nse frequencies....Some of these are not very clear or loud enough too. But =\r\nmany will depend on your computer sound card & your headphones. I have let =\r\nan older man listen (in his late 60&#39;s) and he has heard most all of the aud=\r\nio. Same with a few guys at work. Some hear them right away, and others can=\r\n&#39;t until I loop the actually EVP for a few tries. I personally use a Dell L=\r\natitude D430 to hear these. I can hear some on my cell phone. Headphones ar=\r\ne a must....or you won&#39;t hear anything either way. *But some can be heard o=\r\nn cell phone without headphones. The conversion to MP3 has also caused some=\r\n loss, but I am still able to hear them when I review from this site (but I=\r\n have the repetive hearing syndrome in this area no doubt). Although I do h=\r\nave some disbelief (shock) that a few of these are not discernable. Go back=\r\n and listen to &quot;tomorrow let you know&quot; is in a gruffy-robotic melodic tone =\r\nat the very end but with higher natural volume. And if you couldn&#39;t hear th=\r\ne whistle...I would suggest the need to remove the cotton from the ear :) A=\r\ns for feedback.....feedback from what? I only had one recorder working here=\r\n. I would rather hear someone say &quot;I&quot; made the whistle....that would be mor=\r\ne understandable.

On a HAPPIER NOTE :) I was lucky enou=\r\ngh to catch the RR-DR60 taking a nap yesterday....it missed a few evp&#39;s rea=\r\nl close together (in a 5 second clip) the Sony ICD-B7 heard a male use a di=\r\nfferent number than what I used. I said 16 (my earlier age I was saying in =\r\nrecorder) and the male evp said 13....then a female laughs.

If you can&#39;t hear them then it must be either \n      mecha=\r\nnical (sound card or headphones)or maybe your hearing has loss in \n      th=\r\nose frequencies.&lt;WBR&gt;...Some of these are not very clear or loud enough \n  =\r\n    too. But many will depend on your computer sound card &amp; your \n     =\r\n headphones. I have let an older man listen (in his late 60&#39;s) and he has \n=\r\n      heard most all of the audio. Same with a few guys at work. Some hear =\r\nthem \n      right away, and others can&#39;t until I loop the actually EVP for =\r\na few \n      tries. I personally use a Dell Latitude D430 to hear these. I =\r\ncan hear \n      some on my cell phone. Headphones are a must....or you won&#39;=\r\nt hear anything \n      either way. *But some can be heard on cell phone wit=\r\nhout headphones. The \n      conversion to MP3 has also caused some loss, bu=\r\nt I am still able to hear \n      them when I review from this site (but I h=\r\nave the repetive hearing \n      syndrome in this area no doubt). Although I=\r\n do have some disbelief (shock) \n      that a few of these are not discerna=\r\nble. Go back and listen to &quot;tomorrow \n      let you know&quot; is in a gruffy-ro=\r\nbotic melodic tone at the very end but with \n      higher natural volume. A=\r\nnd if you couldn&#39;t hear the whistle...I would \n      suggest the need to re=\r\nmove the cotton from the ear :) As for \n      feedback....&lt;WBR&gt;.feedback fr=\r\nom what? I only had one recorder working \n      here. I would rather hear s=\r\nomeone say &quot;I&quot; made the whistle....that would \n      be more understandable=\r\n. And is very true....if someone &quot;tells&quot; the group \n      that THIS is supp=\r\nosed to be what WAS said, then is very difficult to clear \n      the mind t=\r\no hear it any other way. Kinda like trying to hum another song \n      while=\r\n a different one is playing :) --- In &lt;A \n      href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&quot; \n      target=3D_blank&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Ap=\r\nril Abercrombie&quot; \n      &lt;april@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s the=\r\n thing though - if you \n      put something out there, and ask people to li=\r\nsten to it, your inviting \n      opinions.
