Hi Heather,

Are you related to Dale Kaczmarek?

I&#x27;ve put one of those camcorders that records onto a hard drive on my wish 
list.  I&#x27;ve about had it with Hi-8 or Digital-8 tape drives that break 
down and cost a fortune to repair if they do.

&gt; Hi!

&gt; I&#x27;m new to the group. I was doing ITC looped through the TV until my camcorder broke. Now I am saving for a new one. Digital this time! Anyway, I thought the pictures were just wonderful and I would be excited about them too!! I am also curious what you are doing to get such clear photos. I have gotten &quot;scenes&quot;, faces, silhouettes, etc. Nothing that clear.
&gt;
&gt; I have also used running water too for ITC with good results.
&gt;
&gt; I am very curious about how you are set up!

&gt;
&gt;  I have to agree with you on this one.  That is pretty impressive.  What configuration are you using.  I have done some video work using the continuous loop idea of recording the television screen showing the same television screen that I was recording, if that makes any sense.

&gt;     It&#x27;s a bit frustrating to be excited all to hell about something and nobody cares!
