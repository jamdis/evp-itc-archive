<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thank you, Misty.  It&#x27;s always amazing to me that those in spirit can use such a wide 
variety of methods to communicate with us.  

Quick question... what am I doing wrong that causes the text in my posts not to wrap 
around properly?  (if that&#x27;s the correct terminology)

&gt; Thanks Margaret everyone appreciates this. I did get a chance today to go thru your 
files. I can hear all of the minibox, sweep, crowd babble, exactly as you do, the SJ method 
I hear some words as you do and some a bit different. I love the pictures, Ive visited your 
site before you joined here and have gone thru the gallery. It&#x27;s quite impressive and 
interesting. Many remind me of what I have recieved using simliar methods.
&gt;    
&gt;   Great stuff!

&gt;           Rather than generating a gazillion separate notifications, I figured I would do this 
one single 
&gt; announcement stating that I have posted a couple examples in each of my subfolders. 
There 
&gt; are two different types of ITC, and various EVP (MiniBox, manual radio sweep, 
traditional, 
&gt; Portuguese crowd babble, etc.) The files are pretty small, so I&#x27;m not hogging up a lot 
space.
&gt; 
&gt; I always enjoy listening to and seeing other people&#x27;s examples. I&#x27;m hoping others might 
&gt; enjoy some of my examples as well, especially my water video ITC results (which as far 
as I 
&gt; know, I was the first to come up with this technique). Other people have tried it and 
gotten 
&gt; really good results, so if you&#x27;re looking for something new and fun to try, please give it 
a 
&gt; whirl. 
&gt; 
&gt; I really appreciate all the inspiration I&#x27;ve gotten from others. I&#x27;m trying to give back a 
little. 
&gt;
