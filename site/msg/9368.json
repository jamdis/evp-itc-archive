I&#39;m not finding it at the moment, but \nthey video&#39;d one of the sessions.  It was quite interesting, but I don&#39;t remember which \nresearcher (it was a man) that was conducting the session.  \n\nMargaret  \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jeremy Robert Huber&quot; &lt;JeremyRobertHuber@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The communication was done not via radio, but telephone directly to\n&gt; the researchers homes. There were numerous telephone calls made to\n&gt; Maggy Harsch-Fishbach, Mark Macy and even to Sarah Estep. These phone\n&gt; calls were made by members of the group on the Other Side working with\n&gt; ITC researchers during the 1990&#39;s. The group working with the ITC\n&gt; researchers were guided by seven Ethereal beings on the Other Side\n&gt; called The Seven. Contact was not only made via telephone, but also\n&gt; fax and files placed in Maggy Fishbach&#39;s computer. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I highly recommend Mr. Macy&#39;s book, Miracles In The Storm. He has much\n&gt; of this information on his website. http://worlditc.org\n&gt; \n&gt; Many Blessings All,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeremy Robert Huber\n&gt; New York, New York\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And were using Hacked Radios to talk to the dead! I am not sure I \n&gt; &gt; believe that one. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kay\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &lt;JeremyRobertHuber@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That is the phone call made to Mark Macy by Konstantin Raudive. Mr. \n&gt; &gt; Macy talked about this phone call in his excellent book &quot;Miracles In \n&gt; &gt; The Storm.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many Blessings All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jeremy Robert Huber\n&gt; &gt; &gt; New York, New York\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
