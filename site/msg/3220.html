I see the negative, but I balance it against the positive. This is  
called risk assessment, and we do it everyday for every action we  
take. To me, after neutral assessment of all the possibilities, both  
good and bad, and weighing of the evidence we do have from three to  
four decades of EVP and ITC, the rational conclusion appears to be  
that you take no more risk using a box then you do using a tape  
recorder. The box&#x27;s realtime talkback ability does not allow for  
extended messages-- they tend to be of the length of an EVP and  
sometimes fragment in the middle, just as EVP do. So  a person might  
hear &quot;You bastard,&quot; or such, but he is very unlikely to hear a long  
and spellbinding seduction to come to the Dark Side. The only  
difference between the box and EVP, from what I have listened to so  
far, is that it can be heard in realtime--there can be a quick and  
indisputable reply to a question. That doesn&#x27;t mean it can always be  
understood in realtime. I suspect box users are having to go back and  
re-listen to actually hear what was said.

Anyway, a neutral risk assessment shows clearly that one has a lot  
less chance of being harmed by a box than by benefiting by it.

Personally, I&#x27;m not afraid of these so-called dark entities. If I  
don&#x27;t let them, they can&#x27;t do a darned thing to me. Never have; never  
will. Worrying about them is a waste of time. Just approach the  
research with a positive attitude and &quot;the stomach of a lion,&quot; the  
quote Elizabeth I. And to quote another great leader, &quot;The only thing  
we have to fear is fear itself.&quot;
