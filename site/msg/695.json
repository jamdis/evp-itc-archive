I cant say its haunted, because it \ndoes not seem as tho something is &#39;haunting&#39; this house... \ninstead I think something lives here along with us.\nsomething that may have been here ages ago.\n\nI just want proof of what we see and hear in this house .   \n and thought learning more about EVP might help us in this quest.\n\nLyn\nsan antonio texas"}
