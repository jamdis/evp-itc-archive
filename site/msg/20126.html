&gt; Frank, if you get a chance check out the psychic twins.  They were on c2c a while back and their predictions were dead on.
&gt; 
&gt; They even played their predictions from a previous show they were on to prove they were right.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m hardly ever impressed by psychic, but these woman were good.  The field got flooded in the past few years, everyone is either a demonologist or a psychic now.
&gt; 
&gt; Even Chris Moon recently became a psychic, maybe he took an online course...lol

&gt; &gt;  Validation! Star-whatever was telling about time shifts, and how she uses
&gt; &gt; it to foretell stuff--acurately. Supposedly had very acurate predictions for
&gt; &gt; 2010, sounded more like remote viewing.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  At least it wasn&#x27;t the same old safe crap Norry usually has on. It was
&gt; &gt; hosted by Strieber.
