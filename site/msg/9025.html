<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce,   Yes, I will be checking them out again to make sure.  They 
are grey and white, and come in a box that is either white and 
magenta or white and red...
If they are the old, I will get both and give them away for cost only 
to someone that needs one.  I&#x27;ll just wait to find out who in time.
Thanks for the info.  
~ Laura

&gt; Laura, 
&gt;  
&gt; first make sure they are old model 470&#x27;s
&gt; they should be white and silver and come packaged in a box not 
&gt; all black with clear plastic packaging.
&gt;  
&gt; If they are the old model 470 definatelly take the two of them.
&gt; there are not only new people but some vets that would want a spare.
&gt;  
&gt; It is a miricle you found any at all. I believed the country was 
picked clean.
&gt;  
&gt; Just don&#x27;t let the sales man tell you &quot;yes we have them&quot; quite a few
&gt; people called and where assured of what the store had, only to 
travel there and
&gt; find the new model 470. most of the time the sales person will just 
look at the 
&gt; part number and say yes we have them.
