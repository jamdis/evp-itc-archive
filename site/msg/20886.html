<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>reversed and slowed?  that&#x27;s it?  ok well I don&#x27;t see what the big deal is, that was pretty clear to me (with prompting from snow on what she suggests it says - not sure what I would&#x27;ve heard without prompting, but yeah, pretty darn clear)....

&gt; &gt; Thanks for hearing that Sharon, it was a reverse file too!  So, glad you told me you can hear it, very few seem to be able to, Steve says he can&#x27;t hear it either :(  I was beginning to wonder if I were going nuts or something, I mean when no one acknowledges they hear it too what is a person to think,  you know?  Tim couldn&#x27;t hear it until I slowed it down, then he says, it&#x27;s a &quot;class C EVP&quot;  probably is because it was hidden in reverse, but when I reversed the whole file it popped out like a sore thumb!
