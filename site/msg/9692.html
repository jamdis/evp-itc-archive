Hey Kristin,

I am working with a Spirit using the recorder on my laptop.

=
He is able to form a few words without the use of white noise.

I asked him=
 yesterday if they eat and drink.

He said... Yes...we...and ran out of ste=
am...but it is very easy for him to blow the words hello into the mic on my=
 computer. So we use hello as an affirmative sometimes.

From what he has t=
old me, they do eat and drink. Which is what matches other material I have =
read.

Blessings,

Jeremy
New York, New York
