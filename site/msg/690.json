Just to be clear, \nI don&#39;t do &quot;investigations&quot;, nor do I believe in that stuff.  I do all my \nwork from my basement. I think the only purpose of EVP is to prove to \noneself that life is forever. I find these &quot;investigation&quot; sites with all \nthe ghastly images of demons, skeletons, and ghosts an abomination, and very \nmis-leading to anyone that has any interset in non physical research. It&#39;s a \nfocus on the frightenning for the purpose of giving cheap thrills or making \na quick buck.\n\nI&#39;m getting &quot;requests&quot; for my systems from these investigator types for my \nboxes. I would prefer that my stuff not be used for these negative purposes, \nfor which is is not designed, nor intended. It&#39;s intended to be used as a \nhome type reciever system for contact with spirits and other enities, not \nfor the rather dubious activity of &quot;ghost investigations&quot;.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nInvite your Hotmail contacts to join your friends list with Windows Live \nSpaces \nhttp://clk.atdmt.com/MSN/go/msnnkwsp0070000001msn/direct/01/?href=http://spaces.live.com/spacesapi.aspx?wx_action=create&wx_url=/friends.aspx&mkt=en-us"}
