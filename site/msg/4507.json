The \nexistence of this voice is strictly a scientific fact and has nothing \nto do with spiritism. The recorder is totally objective. It receives \nand records only sound waves from wherever they come. This experiment \nmay perhaps become the cornerstone for a building for scientific \nstudies which will strengthen people&#39;s faith in a hereafter .\n(Italian Journal Astra, June 1990 quoted Kubis and Macy, 1995: 102).\n\n Pope Pius&#39; cousin, the Rev. Professor Dr Gebhard Frei, co-founder \nof the Jung Institute, was an internationally known parapsychologist \nwho worked closely with Raudive, a pioneer in the research. He was \nalso the President of the International Society for Catholic \nParapsychologists. He himself is on record as stating: \n\nAll that I have read and heard forces me to believe that the voices \ncome from transcendental, individual entities. Whether it suits me or \nnot, I have no right to doubt the reality of the voices (Kubris and \nMacy, 1995:104).\n\n Dr Frie died on October 27, 1967. In November 1967 at numerous \ntaping sessions a voice giving its name as Gebhard Frei came through. \nThe voice was identified by Professor Peter Hohenwarter of the \nUniversity of Vienna as positively belonging to Dr Frei (Ostrander \nand Schroeder, 1977: 271).\n\n Pope Paul VI was well aware of the work being done from 1959 \nonwards on the Elecronic Voices by his good friend, Swedish film \nproducer Friedrich Jurgenson, who had made a documentary film about \nhim. The Pope made Jurgenson a Knight Commander of the Order of St \nGregory in 1969 for his work (see picture left). Jurgenson wrote to \nBander, a British voice researcher:\n\nI have found a sympathetic ear for the Voice Phenomenon in the \nVatican. I have won many wonderful friends among the leading figures \nin the Holy City. Today &#39;the bridge&#39; stands firmly on its foundations \n(Ostrander and Schroeder, 1977: 264).\n\n The Vatican also gave permission for its own priests to conduct \nresearch into the voicesFather Leo Schmid, a Swiss theologist, \ncollected more than ten thousand of them in his book When the Dead \nSpeak which was published in 1976, shortly after his death.\n\n Another Vatican-approved researcher was Father Andreas Resch who as \nwell as conducting his own experiments began courses in \nParapsychology at the Vatican&#39;s school for priests in Rome (Kubris \nand Macy, 1995:104). \n\n In 1970 the International Society for Catholic Parapsychologists \nheld a conference in Austria and a major part of that conference was \nconcerned with papers on the Electronic Voice Phenomena.\n\n In England in 1972 four senior members of the Catholic hierarchy \nwere involved in the famous Pye recording studio tests conducted by \nPeter Bander.\n\n Father Pistone, Superior of the Society of St Paul in England, said \nin an interview after the tests:\n\nI do not see anything against the teaching of the Catholic Church in \nthe Voices, they are something extra-ordinary but there is no reason \nto fear them, nor can I see any danger (Bander 1973: 132).\n\nThe Church realizes that she cannot control the evolution of science. \nHere we are dealing with a scientific phenomenon; this is progress \nand the Church is progressive. I am happy to see that representatives \nof most Churches have adopted the same attitude as we have: we \nrecognize that the subject of the Voice Phenomena stirs the \nimagination even of those who have always maintained that there could \nnever be any proof or basis for discussion on the question of life \nafter death. This book and the subsequent experiments raise serious \ndoubts, even in the minds of atheists. This alone is a good reason \nfor the Church supporting the experiments. A second reason may be \nfound in the greater flexibility of the Church since Vatican II, we \nare willing to keep an open mind on all matters which do not \ncontradict Christ&#39;s teaching (Bander 1973:103).\n\n His excellence, Archbishop H.E. Cardinale, Apostolic Nuncio to \nBelgium, commented:\n\nNaturally it is all very mysterious, but we know the voices are there \nfor all to hear them (Bander 1973: 132).\n\n The Right Reverend Monsignor Professor C. Pfleger commented:\n\nFacts have made us realize that between death and resurrection there \nis another realm of post-mortal existence. Christian theology has \nlittle to say about this realm (Bander 1973 : 133).\n\n Bander&#39;s book (1973: 133) contains a photograph of the Right \nReverend Mgr. Stephen O&#39;Connor, Vicar General and Principal Roman \nCatholic Chaplain to the Royal Navy, listening to the playback of a \nrecording on which a voice had manifested claiming to be that of a \nyoung Russian naval officer known to himself who had committed \nsuicide two years earlier. Dr Raudive had recorded the message \nindependently at an earlier session.\n\n Since the 1970s the Vatican has continued to sponsor extensive \nresearch into all areas of parapsychology including Electronic Voice \nPhenomena. \n\n Recently Father Gino Concetti, one of the most competent \ntheologians in the Vatican, said in an interview:\n\nAccording to the modern catechism, God allows our dear departed \npersons who live in an ultra-terrestrial dimension, to send messages \nto guide us in certain difficult moments of our lives. The Church has \ndecided not to forbid any more the dialogue with the deceased with \nthe condition that these contacts are carried out with a serious \nreligious and scientific purpose (printed in the Vatican newspaper \nOsservatore Romanocited in Sarah Estep&#39;s American Association \nElectronic VoicePhenomena, Inc Newsletter, vol 16 No, 2 1997 ) \n\nClearly, the Catholic Church realizes that science is making \nenormous, inevitable, irreversible and cumulative progress which \nnobody is in a position to stop."}
