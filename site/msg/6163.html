Mike and Lisa seem to be the powerhouses around here. Despite the fact
that I&#x27;m told my technician&#x27;s name is David (which is also the name of
someone else&#x27;s technician here), it&#x27;s Mike and Lisa whose names I hear
over and over and over. I hear the name or number Seven; I often hear
the name Frank. I was speculating that that is Sumption, but it may be
another technician.

So, we&#x27;ve got Mike, Lisa, Seven, David, and possibly Frank, who seem
to be operating for most of us.

Anyone else have a technician that I am missing?

&gt;  I personally believe I received responses 
&gt; yesterday from &quot;Mike &amp; Lisa.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Yet, I still wonder if they are referencing the time being short, 
&gt; with respect to whatever is coming.  Maybe they mean the thinning of 
&gt; the veil between spirit and physical??.
&gt; 
&gt; How many technicians are out there?  How many have been identified?  
&gt; I know mine have been male-female sounding...others?
