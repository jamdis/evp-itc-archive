<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>William,

I believe the water method is used with traditional EVP and can not 
be used for box communication. I believe it is when a researcher 
turns on a faucet or some other type of running water source and 
proceeds to record the way you would record any traditional evp 
session. I think the premise is that any spirits willing or wishing 
to communicate use the white noise sound of the running water to form 
the words they place on the recording medium.

I personally have never heard any files or recordings using this 
method that contained any spirit communication. I have a fish tank in 
my bedroom that is continually making the sound of running water.
At night when it is very quiet and I am relaxed by the sound the 
water makes, I could swear I can hear voices within the sound of the 
water.

I do not rule out any possibility but in my experience it is most 
likely your mind manipulating the sound and trying to make sense of 
it.

&gt;   What is the water method?

&gt;             I find some like certain methods better to make thier 
voice. And often they will state thier approval or disapproval for 
the method I am experimenting with. A few do not like music method 
they say its too much noise they cant get a word in edgewise, yet 
others enjoy it and make use of it with ease speaking very loud over 
the music notes. For water method nobody complains (i dont know why) 
and for sweep methods, only a few seem to have trouble using it to 
form thier words.
&gt;    
&gt;   Perhaps it has to do with vibrational frequencies I dont know. 
Once the lines are open and communication is flowing it gets 
interesting to say the least =)
&gt;    
&gt;   Just experiment and find whats working best for you personally.

&gt;       This is an interesting conversation. Personally, I use my 
hack to
&gt; communicate with a spirit who is definitely grounded. Sometimes the
&gt; communications come through as bits of radio waves put together to
&gt; form words or sentences, and other times, they sound more like
&gt; traditional evps. One of the little things I&#x27;m trying to figure out
&gt; is why I could never get evps from him after a year of trying, but 
he
&gt; has taken to communicating through the box like a fish to water.
