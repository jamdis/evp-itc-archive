Re: [EVP-ITC] Nothin'!



      Your right Frank, it all depends on expecta=
tions and what degree of proof it will take for someone to accept the exist=
ence of the beyond and the entities who reside there. People all over the w=
orld scream for proof but yet if you ask them they cannot define what crite=
ria they require for proof. Why? Because they are so brainwashed in our soc=
ieties materialistic teachings they never expect to receive proof, so they =
don't even bother to define such a criteria.

      Its amazing to me that =
a primarily spiritual creature such as ourselves can deny our connections w=
ith that world and the source. The connections we experience everyday and a=
t all times in the form of dreams, random thoughts and inspirations are so =
easily taken for granted and written off as figments of imagination, trivia=
l thoughts and meaningless aspirations. Even as a child I knew I was unique=
 as was every person on the face of the planet. I knew that their were as m=
any perspectives of reality as their were people to have them and that each=
 and every one of them were just as valid as the other no matter how outlan=
dish it seemed to me.

      Acceptance was taught to me instead of beliefs=
. Beliefs can enhance the truth but they are not in themselves true.

     =
 More than I expected to write but I feel it is still valid,

      Best re=
gards,
