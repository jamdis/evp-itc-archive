I&#39;ve hacked the radio, but do not\nhave a port into my sound card. Any suggestions of different\nconfigurations that have worked well for you. I&#39;m in Atlanta so we\nhave a lot of stations and I&#39;m getting what seems like a lot of one\nstation or another when it scans. Do you find it necessary to mix the\nraw audio with white noise?"}
