&gt;                We originally Steve, myself and Jeff started doing 
sessions via Skye.  At that time I was not in position of a Frank&#x27;s 
or Joe&#x27;s Box.  Therefore we were able to conduct sessions using every 
ones boxes.  Upon receiving my #12 Franks Box, I want to afford the 
an opportunity to anyone that want to partake and experience all the 
boxes since they are not readily available.  This way everyone could 
learn the different pitches and tones for the different devices.  I 
figured I waited so long for mine and know how much it means to me, 
therefore, several of us didn&#x27;t want those who didn&#x27;t own one not to 
lose either, thus the Skye sessions were born (so to speak).  Even 
though you do not have the devices and/or boxes at your location, you 
can still record the session.
&gt;    
&gt;                 I myself do 2 types of recordings and/or sessions.  
One I just let the recorder run, like Frank does and the other I do 
ask questions.  What I am lead to believe either way, they already 
know what your pretty much going to ask so, sometimes its just better 
to NOT ASK QUESTIONS AT ALL, but to let them do their thing so you do 
not speak over them.
&gt;    
&gt;                 Hope this helps!

up and refresh me?  I don&#x27;t think I was privy for the first of the 
conversations. 
&gt;    
&gt;   I have a team member working with a friend in Malta. They talk on 
Skye alot, and get ALOT OF EVPS. We figured it was from interferance, 
but the voices seemed to correlate with what was conspiring with the 
family.
&gt;    
&gt;   Thanks alot guys
