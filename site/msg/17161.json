I don&#39;t see these in  \n&gt; the &quot;Attachments&quot; link on the left hand side of this page, and the \n&gt; attachment  boxes in your message aren&#39;t live links? But thanks very much for putting \n&gt; them  up here. I just have to find out how to open them.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com_ (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) ,  \n&gt; SnowfireL@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here are some of my recent files, a bit  of everything, enjoy and have a \n&gt; &gt; happy day.  sf\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
