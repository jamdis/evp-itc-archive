Go ahead, use a farady \ncage, block all raw audio out, and when you get no voices/evp, you can \nproclaim there is no evidence for spirit! Same old &quot;scientific&quot; crap. \nWhatever you do, don&#39;t ask anyone that&#39;s been doing this work for \nclose to ten years, in my case, and close to 30 years for the inventor \nof EVPmaker, god forbid you should ask any real experts. Oh, yeah, \ntitles and degrees mean y&#39;all already know everything knowable!\n\n Frank-S"}
