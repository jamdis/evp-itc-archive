 I took this as a severe slap to the face, very insulting to me, and every paranormal researcher in the world. He claims the 'real voices' he gets are made out of white noise combined with broadcast fragments. Duffus!! That is exactly the kind of voices the living mind creates to get the voices it wants to hear. Yet only his are the real voices! My old friend, you can take your 'serious session' and your bishop, and shove 'em. 
 
 
 My apoplogies to the group, but I know this will get forwarded, and this bozo finds me so easy to dismiss, that normal e-mail would be useless. 
 
 I had to cut some out for nice sakes.
