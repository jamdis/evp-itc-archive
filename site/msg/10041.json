This impression was \n&gt; &gt; strengthened by the observation that the buzzing sound often was \n&gt; even \n&gt; &gt; modulated by O&#39;Neill&#39;s own voice during the dialoges between him \n&gt; &gt; and &quot;Dr. Mueller&quot;! (Did O&#39;Neill forget to remove the device from \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; throat while talking to his counterpart?)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; And what about the &quot;13 frequencies&quot; that are supposed to be \nused \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; the &quot;carrier&quot; for the spirit voices? Why aren&#39;t they audible in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; recordings? And why does a mixture of the 13 tones created with \n&gt; &gt; Audition sound so different from the typical &quot;Spiricom buzz&quot;? - \n&gt; Well, \n&gt; &gt; if you analyze the frequency spectrum of the buzzing sound (this \n&gt; can \n&gt; &gt; be done with Audition etc.), you will find a lot of harmonics \n&gt; (peaks \n&gt; &gt; in the spectrum), and some of these harmonics more or less match \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; 13 Spiricom frequencies...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To me, the entire Spiricom saga produces more questions than \n&gt; &gt; answers...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- original Nachricht --------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Betreff: [EVP-ITC] Re: Spirico Device\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gesendet: Fr, 18.

As to O&#39;Neil&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; motivation for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the hoax - I still don&#39;t know. But I will also say that \nthe \n&gt; &gt; veridical \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evidence that O&#39;Neil claims to have received about Dr. \nGeorge \n&gt; &gt; J. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mueller through clairaudience is amazing and it is tough \nto \n&gt; see \n&gt; &gt; how \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; O&#39;Neil would have gotten this information given his \nfinances, \n&gt; &gt; location, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the timeframe, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been promising to get my personal website up and \n&gt; operating \n&gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some time now but have been busy. Hopefully soon.
