I expect to see some vsriations, what bothers me is when most just hear a broadcast frags, then I have to question my sanity. \n\n &quot;They&#39;ve&quot; called me Kiera since before the boxes, I heard &quot;Kiera, it&#39;s time to come home&quot; like telepathicaly in 2000. So I asked via EVPmaker who she was, and they said &quot;she&#39;s our Princess&quot;, and ever since they insist I was/am/will be her. Purple Princess Kiera. That much remains unchanged over the last ten years.\n\n I don&#39;t use EVP as most, for ghost hunting, I use it for personal messages, and rarely go to haunted areas. So I&#39;m kinda put off by what of these ghost hunters do to and with boxes.\n\n F-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Adriana Jones&quot; &lt;adrianamjones@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes the R is a rolling R and &quot;proving&quot; is high pitched... however just going on my own ears without any suggestions, it could also sound like &quot;hide keira&quot; or &quot;hi keira&quot;, and &quot;we&#39;re proving&quot; could also sound like &quot;improving&quot;.. either the sound file or the communication is not very clear... does it sound clearer than this in real life, or is the recorder pretty much capturing it as clearly as it can?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  So somebody does hear it?
