Agree, disagree it doesn&#39;t matter! That fact is \nwhen the book is written on the ITC and how it was perfected. Frank \nand Chris will have the first and second chapters dedicated to them. \n\nNo matter what side of this argument you come down on there will \nalways be different opinions. ITC Paranormal research may be in vogue \nbut the idea&#39;s certainly are not new. \n\nHowever, we now stand at the apex of this ride. The gates are open.\nThe throttle is stuck, crash or survive we&#39;re in it till the end. Go\naway!, don&#39;t read, don&#39;t try,it won&#39;t matter! This ride has left! Even\njumping off won&#39;t stop it.\n\nWe are now going to see an explosion of new idea&#39;s. But that&#39;s what it\ntakes! People have to take sides, someone has to be right , someone\nhas to be wrong. Without both sides there&#39;s no advancement. \nI read &quot;too many posts&quot; I hate fence sitters either you&#39;re in or\nyou&#39;re out . But learn to smile and say thank you.\n\nHere&#39;s the way it is. You say I&#39;m wrong OK!.   Thank you very much! \nAnd I go about my business of doing what I want to do,  there&#39;s truth\nto every side of an argument. Just take what is constructive and file\nthe rest. Just say Thank You!\n\nPS.\nTo that individual who wrote me claiming to be from the Catholic Arch\ndiocesi I doubt very much that the Catholic Church uses hot mail ...\noh it&#39;s Catholic Archdiocese  LMAO\n\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH!\n\n-Sum"}
