<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree about people who are full of fear.  I see this all the time in
people who come to haunted weekends and investigations.  Usually the
ones who are overcome, or who go home with attachments, came with a
lot of built-in fear about the paranormal in general.  These people
should not be investigating, and definitely should not be seeking
communication interfaces.

&gt; Rosemary,
&gt; 
&gt; I think it is good to try and &quot;disconnect&quot; from the physical world 
&gt; through meditation, as that is where we will hear direction within.  
&gt; For me, it comes as thoughts...a &quot;knowing.&quot;  This is how I hear those 
&gt; who are speaking to me as to direction regarding my work.  They have 
&gt; been doing so for a long time, so I have no fear of where I am 
&gt; heading - even with this.  I realize it is different for each 
&gt; individual.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I think if someone is full of fear, they shouldn&#x27;t be 
&gt; investigating ghosts, etc. Find what keeps you out of fear and roll 
&gt; with it...

&gt; &gt; I think it&#x27;s good to air diverse opinions on whether or not 
&gt; protection
&gt; &gt; measures are advisable.  I agree that it&#x27;s a matter of personal
&gt; &gt; preference, and I think researchers need to experiment to find their
&gt; &gt; own optimum comfort/performance levels.  What works for some will 
&gt; not
&gt; &gt; for others.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Personally, I find that an overall, daily approach of
&gt; &gt; prayer/meditation concerning all of my personal and professional
&gt; &gt; endeavors is the most effective for me.  I don&#x27;t do it to keep 
&gt; things
&gt; &gt; out, but to try to stay oriented on the most positive track.  Words,
&gt; &gt; thoughts and objects have all been demonstrated universally to be
&gt; &gt; tools of spiritual power.  Why not use them if it feels appropriate?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; One of the best things we can do is share &quot;here&#x27;s what works for me&quot;
&gt; &gt; and let others try it to see for themselves.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks, everyone,
&gt; &gt; Rosemary
