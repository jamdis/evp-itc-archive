A few from last night. I remembered Ken&#x27;s comment about photons. I added an optical link to the circuit on the input to the computer. This circuit consists of a transformer fed LED and a phototransistor is uses for the pickup. I&#x27;ll post three of the messages.
&quot;John Lennon......their testing without Lennon&quot;
&quot;Absolutely positive..A new process&quot; (this has an accent)
&quot;Lennons home...I&#x27;m impressed with recording&quot;

Hi Misty, thanks for the comment. I get lots of testing messages, most are not clear enough to post. Last night I tried the remote (basement) Tesla coil using the AM radio sweep upstairs. The overall noise was way to high on the AM band. Even though the session was in large part a failure, a message was still left towards the end of the session.
&quot;Bad filter, they won&#x27;t like it&quot;

Yeah I like that idea too. And I can hear those Dave, and I was testing last night as well.

          Good idea Frank, different modes may work better under different conditions. I got this message last night. 

&quot;They&#x27;re testing, to talk to dead people&quot;

Thanks, yeah I can hear that voice ok. I&#x27;ll try electroninc tuning, as I 
have the board all made, just have to add some switching for different 
modes. I want random, linear, and manual tuning on the same box.

&gt;Thanks Frank, don&#x27;t know if touch is important. There seems to be a &#x27;field&#x27; 
&gt;associated with the process so I don&#x27;t know for sure if physical contact 
&gt;with the tuner is required or even helps. I found another voice towards 
&gt;the start of the same session. This is a slower talker but to my ears the 
&gt;same voice throughout. I hear a male voice and this does require some 
&gt;mental filtering of the high frequency noise. The time that the message is 
&gt;spoken is important because I would have tuned across at least half the FM 
&gt;broadcast band during the message segment.

&gt;This stuff never ceases to amaze me! I have my add on sweep board ready, 
&gt;but I wonder just how important is the human touch on the radio. I was 
&gt;thinking about adding a plate connected to the circuit ground that I just 
&gt;touch while recording. 
&gt; 
&gt;I haven&#x27;t heard much about those &quot;stations&quot; in other cities, and countries 
&gt;for a few years. I still get them once in a while. I think I spend way too 
&gt;much time putting boards together, and don&#x27;t get time to play. This voice 
&gt;even sounds like a British accent.

&gt; &gt;Thanks for the feedback Frank you have a good ear for these messages. 
&gt;Tried 
&gt; &gt;something different tonight. I have a small tesla coil in the basement 
&gt;that 
&gt; &gt;I can run powered mainly by audio (music). This creates broadband noise 
&gt;on 
&gt; &gt;both AM and FM bands on my upstairs tuner. his is a capture doing a sweep 
&gt; &gt;tuning of the FM band while the Tesla coil was running. 
&gt; &gt;&quot;We heard along from Tesla that one human&#x27;s going to be testing&quot; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;The chatter indicates the message is coming from a control point in 
&gt;London!

&gt; &gt;I don&#x27;t know, could be, to me it sounds like &quot;Our Chris-he is giving our

&gt; &gt; &gt;Frank, I got this tonight and it sounds like the same voice swept 
&gt;through 
&gt; &gt; &gt;several station channels. Could they be talking about the Christopher 
&gt;who 
&gt; &gt; &gt;uses one of your boxes?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WOW!! I am amazed that someonme actually tried this! It does work. 
&gt; &gt; &gt;There was 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a Danish(I think) researcher doing the same thing, but never could 
&gt; &gt; &gt;make 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contact with them. I have done this myself, and it can work wiht TV 
&gt; &gt; &gt;too, if 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you can switch channels fast ennough. I think you could use a 
&gt; &gt; &gt;steeper motor 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; controler to randomly turn a stepper moter, to turn the dial. 
&gt; &gt; &gt;Manually 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spinning the dial has one advantage, the sound is clearer! I have 
&gt; &gt; &gt;yet to see 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a method of ITC that produces better results that the random tuning 
&gt; &gt; &gt;methods.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I have a very sensitive old AM tuner with a flywheel tuning 
&gt; &gt; &gt;system. I tried 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;several recording sessions manually sweeping the tuner through the 
&gt; &gt; &gt;AM band 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;late at night. I got pretty good at keeping the dial moving at a 
&gt; &gt; &gt;constant 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;rate of speed. This is not nearly as good as Frank&#x27;s &#x27;hands off&#x27; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;random 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;tuning method but it still produced some results. What impressed 
&gt; &gt; &gt;me most is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that some of the voices sound the same, even though I tuned 
&gt; &gt; &gt;through several 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;channels. This attached capture could be a technical message. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Plug a million hertz&quot; One Million Hertz = 1mhz = 1000khz, which 
&gt; &gt; &gt;is close 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the center frequency for the AM broadcast band.
