<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

I&#x27;m watching the PEAR project&#x27;s graphs.  Friday was relatively uneventful and average, but Saturday had a few startling downward spikes.

Of course, it&#x27;s still early unless this is going to be one pip of an event.  I wouldn&#x27;t expect to see anything significant for the 17th any earlier than the 15th.  In addition, we may not see reactions until the 19th.  These seem to vary with the apparently-related incident/s.

If anyone else wants to follow the numbers, check http://noosphere.princeton.edu/

Generally, I&#x27;m watching the &quot;day summary&quot; pages, linked at the left on the site&#x27;s homepage.  For the clearest visual cues, wait for the day summary page to load and then scroll all the way down to the Overlaid Individual Eggs.

At first, this will seem like a sea of numbers and nothing but colorful masses of lines.

I&#x27;ve been watching this site for years, off &amp; on, and it&#x27;s making general sense to me now... though I&#x27;m very far from being an expert.

Cheerfully,
Fiona
