&gt; I have been quiet through alot of this, and I speak to Frank from time to
&gt; time in private emails. I think some forget that you can argue theory and
&gt; ideas,  but not be personal or petty. We can be civil and friends the end
&gt; of the day, we may agree to disagree about topics, but the proof is in the
&gt; data,isn&#x27;t it? Frank is a really nice guy and I have always been treated
&gt; well by him, learned from him and respect his work. He has put in tireless
&gt; amounts of time and effort into his boxes and has always welcomed ideas and
&gt; discussion on anything he has posted. Can we go back to the scope of this
&gt; group and leave the drama at the door?
