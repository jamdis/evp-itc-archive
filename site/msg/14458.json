When you get EVP that everyone und=\r\nerstands, it is outward, in the environment. Not a communication through su=\r\nbconscious means.\n\nEVP that people swear they hear, but noone else can make=\r\n sense, may be a message to them via subconscious means. That isn&#39;t to say =\r\nthat ALL EVP&#39;s like this are true messages, I am sure alot are just matrixi=\r\nng.\n\nBut then that is how the art of scrying starts-matrixing. Like the Ror=\r\nschach tests. The images you matrix with those gives the psychologist an in=\r\nsight into your mind.\n\nBy gazing into a dark, reflective surface, you start=\r\n to see cloudy images. At first, you will just be matrixing faces in the cl=\r\nouds and not getting much substance. Try it, you will see what I am saying.=\r\n With practice, you start to see clear, concise images.\n\nI think that is wh=\r\nat happening with audio as well.\n\nWe already know for a fact pareidolia can=\r\n occur in audio as well as visual stimulus.\n\n  ----- Original Message -----=\r\n \n  From: Eric VanDuzer \n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, =\r\nMay 20, 2009 10:19 AM\n  Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: I have a question.\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n  yes I understand its personal to that particular individual but why can&#39;t=\r\n I hear it.
