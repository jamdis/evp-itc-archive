Bruce, 
              I have to agree with you.  Given the file folder shortage, I deleted all of my files to give the new comers room.  I hated to do that, given if anyone wanted to revert back to my clips, they could in fact do so and now that can't.   I also hate to have to send someone a link to find my audio on an additional sight.  
   
              Maybe we could comprise and say after "x" amount of days, upon new files being uploaded we could clean house?  I know that not everyone will take it upon themselves to do this, but if they don't (after an announcement from the groups caretakers), if they disappear, its their own fault.
   
               I personally like the single emails announcing each file.  I can go straight to the audio clip and not have to search through previous clips I have already listened to.  
   
  Just my thoughts!

          Yesterday I decided to post some files so I posted to a sub folder of 
my main folder in the files section.
I noticed that some people voiced their dislike of sending post notices 
for every file , so I sent none. Just a single post stating that I had 
posted the files and where they could be found.

Now this is the dilemma, If you do not post an announcement for each 
file and you trust that the single post announcing all the files that 
have been posted will suffice, well I don't think so!

I know that most individuals here do not listen to or reply to every 
single file posted but I will usually get some comments on the better 
or more interesting ones. So far from the posting yesterday "NADA"

If anyone saw the post I wrote announcing the files I posted to the 
files section, please for my own satisfaction let me know.

Otherwise I don't think the one post notice thing is gonna cut it!

Bruce
