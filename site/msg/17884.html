Do you find better results with a uni or omni directional mic?

So how is the mic positioned? Is it on the othe=

feeds into what?

this is how it sounds,=
 at 3 seconds "Purple  Princess Ghost Box".
 
 The first speaker I had glue=

Frank,
 
Couple questions on your echo chamber. How big a=

microphone on each side? Are they enclosed in a box wi=

each end and how are they positioned? Just tryin=
g to piece  things together. :)
