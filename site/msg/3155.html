<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m supposed to be in the lot made in the second week in January. I  
watched the demo for it last night and it seems easy enough to  
understand, even for the technically braindead like me. That said,  
I&#x27;m going to have tuning issues I think, so I will be begging for  
advice.

Happy Thanksgiving, Frank. Let the aliens have some turkey today, too!

&gt; Well at last! I just couldn&#x27;t get it together on maufacturing this  
&gt; stuff, and couldn&#x27;t get all the bugs out--yet. I&#x27;m just not a  
&gt; business person, and not even an engineer. I don&#x27;t think it was for  
&gt; me to produce that boxes, just get the concept out there.  
&gt; Interesting that a non profit outfit is making it. That&#x27;s not to  
&gt; say they give theirs away free either.
&gt;
&gt;  I am very pleased that someone out not only comprehends how the  
&gt; box is supposed to work, but can make it available. It is a relief  
&gt; to me!

&gt; In January, looks like, I will finally get my chance to play, too. ;)
