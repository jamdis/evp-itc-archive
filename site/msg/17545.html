<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi All,

These are from my first session with my new P SB-7.

I conducted this experiment with my 6 year old daughter. Unfortunatley you
will hear her say what she thinks she hears in the files. Please try not to
be influenced by her. I will admit though that she seems to hear these
things much better then I can.

Though I am still not convinced, some of these are uncanny, and I was
surprised. I will be conducting ongoing, regular experiments with this.

Opinions are welcome.

Thanks!
April
