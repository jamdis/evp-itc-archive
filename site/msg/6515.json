Thats \nwhy I sent out that program because it has next to no loss in the \nconversion. But again I will say I would rather post 1 meg of files \nthan take up the entire groups space by posting 15 megs of files. \nWhen I want to share more complete audio I just use my esnips.com \naccount to do that. It is just as easy for people to click on my \nesnips hotlink in a notification post as it is to click on the files \nlink to the left.\n\nYou are right we just have to manage ourselves better.\n\nMisty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I post in wav. format I believe when you convert the file from wav \nto mp3.\n&gt; certain aspects of the file are lost. If an mp3. file is a tenth of \nthe size of\n&gt; a wav. file where does the other 9/10&#39;s go.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If it is compressed then it definitely loses quality. \n&gt; I think every nuance in a box file is crucial for the \n&gt; correct interpretation of the file, sometimes the a word created by \nthe entity is not only\n&gt; comprised of radio fragment but also static noise mixed with the \nfragments of radio vocal\n&gt; to form the message the entity wishes to leave. I don&#39;t know the \ntechnical aspects of the file \n&gt; change but I think it&#39;s common sense that when you try to pour a \ngallon of water into a shot glass\n&gt; all you wind up with is a shot glass full of water the rest is \nspilled and lost.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I keep my files posted for 5 or less days, just long enough for \nanyone that wants to listen can.\n&gt; If your going to leave your files posted indefinitely and keep \nadding to the folder then of course it will\n&gt; put pressure on the storage space.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As far as posting a notice for every file, some of us may wish to \nlisten from their e-mail or not \n&gt; have to go to the file section to listen, That&#39;s probably why that \noption is given.\n&gt; If I didn&#39;t like the notices cluttering up my e-mail in box you can \nchange that feature in the group\n&gt; membership options. So if anyone does not want that feature they \ncan turn it off and only read posts on the group.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It&#39;s not the lack of space is the mismanagement of it by all of us. \n&gt; when I change my files from wav. to mp3 I hear a distinct \ndifference, do it in an audio editor and you can visually see the \ndifference.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: warrior18eii@...: Wed, 30 Jan 2008 05:05:37 -\n0800Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: **Special Notice Regaurding Your Group \nMembership**\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s a great idea Steve and it was mentioned before but either no \none noticed Misty&#39;s post or it was ignored.

One solution is to post Mp3 files instead of \nWav. files or any other format. It seems like the Mp3&#39;s sound the \nsame and are only 1/10th of the size. I think that would probably \nclear up 90 percent of the board right there. If i actually have more \nthan a couple files from here on out, i will be attaching them to an \ne-mail and not the board to save space here. And also, if people do \npost files maybe we can all just have one post that says we have \nuploaded files to our folder instead of 30 audio announcements in a \nrow that just seems to waste a lot of e-mail space in the individual \ne-mails. And it also pushes the current topic on the board to another \npage and is lost for those who wanted to share. Just my thoughts on \nhelping the subject. I know we are all excited, but misty is right. I \nwent to add a file the other day and the group was at 93 percent \ncapacity, so it won&#39;t be long before we run out of space.-Steve H.--- \nIn EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, &quot;Misty&quot; &lt;bulletbabea@ ...&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Just \na little friendly reminder that you all need to organize your &gt; files \nbetter in the files area. Space is limited here and you are all &gt; \nnearing the 100% mark so try to keep your section under 5 megs. If &gt; \nyou need more space use www.esnips.com and you can store 50 gigs to &gt; \nshare with the group or public.&gt; &gt; I think it is great you guys have \nso much to share I just wish that &gt; our yahoo group wasnt so limited \non space (and that I wasnt so &gt; limited on time). But I have found a \nway around it. If just a few &gt; people signed up and shared using \nesnips they can invite others to &gt; visit thier files and once they do \nthey also get 50 gigs of free &gt; space for audio pictures or video or \nwhatever you want to post.&gt; &gt; I was considering setting up \none &quot;group&quot; account to start with and &gt; inviting all members who post \nfiles to join it and be able to post to &gt; the account. It will \nautomatically notify everyone thats a member &gt; when a file is added \nto it just like the yahoo group does. It also &gt; allows you to share \nwith the public or privately if you so choose. &gt; You can even allow \nyour friends to post to your account if you wish.&gt; &gt; This group has \ngrown and expanded and we just need to make a few &gt; changes to how we \ndo things to keep it running more smoothly for the &gt; future. I am \nhoping that you all will help me in this endeavor. I &gt; know many of \nyou have already adapted the idea to help us organize &gt; and maintain \nthe group.&gt; &gt; I want you to keep sharing and to be able to share \nmore! &gt; &gt; So please organize and not post stray files that are \ntargets for &gt; deletion once the que is 100% full. And for your own \nsake, if no one &gt; elses, be respectful to each other.&gt; &gt; MD&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
