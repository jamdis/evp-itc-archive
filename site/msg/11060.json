I \nhave been experimenting with evp for awhile but never really got into it \nuntil a couple months ago. My neighbor always complains about hearing \nfootsteps in his apartment but that there is never anyone there. I live \nabove him and have some activity myself. When he stopped the other night \nI asked if while he was here could I put a recorder in his place and he \nsaid yes. I showed him how to turn it on and he went downstairs. I asked \nthat he have everything turned off and he said he did. However, he \nforgot to turn his fan off. I now have over an hours worth of recording \nof a fan running. I just started using Gold Wave. Does anyone - without \ngetting to technical - know how to remove the fan?\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nMick"}
