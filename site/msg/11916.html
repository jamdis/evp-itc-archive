<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Don&#x27;t you think it&#x27;s more likely that they&#x27;re both? I always try to  
follow the crime investigation maxim that the simplest explanation is  
the most likely. Why should there be two groups? Why not just one  
full of anarchists, loyal neither to black or white? Most everything  
in this world falls into the area of gray. I think it&#x27;s therefore  
likely that this is true of the next.

&gt; It&#x27;s because of her work and some of Frank S.&#x27;s stuff that I have  
&gt; to wonder if there are 2 &quot;Fish Groups&quot;. One good and helpful and  
&gt; the other not.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s a good site. I think we&#x27;re all mediums to a lesser and  
&gt; greater extent. Some seem to have a natural knack at being  
&gt; sensitive and some don&#x27;t - some are in between. I tend to feel it&#x27;s  
&gt; a talent like being a natural musician, singer, or artist. Some  
&gt; have it naturally, some don&#x27;t, some can learn by being taught, but  
&gt; aren&#x27;t ever as good as the naturally gifted.

&gt;&gt; w. I just finished a couple hour review of the web site you sent  
&gt;&gt; for Sandra Belanger at http://www.heliumraven.com/home    Man did  
&gt;&gt; that answer a lot of questions I had about how this technology can  
&gt;&gt; work with mediumship/spiritualism.  Also renewed my hope in  
&gt;&gt; working with evpmaker.  The case history that Sandra recounts on  
&gt;&gt; the site should be a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone serious about  
&gt;&gt; evp.itc.  I would like to understand more about the relationship  
&gt;&gt; between evp and mediumship.  Does a &quot;good&quot; evper need to be a  
&gt;&gt; &quot;sensitive&quot; or medium or does it just give someone with the  
&gt;&gt; sensitivity the edge over someone else?  Even Sandra now says that  
&gt;&gt; she had a certain amount of &quot;sensitivity&quot; before she started using  
&gt;&gt; evp technology and that now she actually &quot;communicates directly&quot;  
&gt;&gt; with spirit.  To me that means she is a medium....no?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also, regarding the Fish Group...I was taken back to read on her  
&gt;&gt; website that The Fish Group was helpful in having her &quot;solve&quot; the  
&gt;&gt; Lacy Peterson case.   Chalk a good deed up to The Fish Group.    
&gt;&gt; Thanks for the web site.  Ron l
