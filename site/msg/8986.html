Very well put, Bruce.  Profitable gain in the paranormal field is sickening=

If someone is afraid to try hackin=
g a radio or lacks the proper tools, they are more than welcome to send the=
m to me and I'll do it for them and ship it back.  As Bruce said, it's not =
for recognition, but it's to help further the research.  I wouldn't be doin=

 in their time and effort.  The possibilities are only limited by our willi=

Do not give in to these demons that are trying t=
o make a buck from the research we love and the equipment we use.
 
I have =
given away including the shipping 5 RS boxes for free, 4, 470's and 1 469 a=
ll hacked by me.
I did not do it to gain popularity or even wanted a thank =
you. my sole motivation was to bring new people into the research and 
in t=
urn change someones life and perpetuate the idea of strength in numbers, in=
 this case strength of communication.
 
To all new people on this board, do=
 not patronise these wolves that prey on the needs and wants of others. 
Th=
e RS 20 -125 is everything the 470 & 469 are and a little more. do not let =
the size or complicated button arrangement scare you off.
the hack is as si=
mple as the others. 
 
Do not buy any RS hacks from ebay, they are sold wit=
h the wrong energy attached to them, spirit wise.
That is why I and all oth=
er researchers should follow the example of a great man to whom we owe all =
of this research.
Mr. Frank Sumption, who was in a position at one time to =
make a substantial amount of money from his boxes and
was offered the oppor=
tunity on a silver platter. But chose to follow what had been asked of him =
by higher entities.
And that was to keep the research pure for research sak=
e. And that at no time was this equipment or knowledge there of
to be for m=
onetary gain.
 
I adhere to this promise made by Frank to our friends on th=
e other side and feel that there is no need to give in to these box 
extort=
ionists. If a box is not attainable for a new person yet, the right way. Th=
en it probably is not their time yet.
 
I have coined a phrase and believe =
in it. "The researcher does not choose the box, the box chooses the researc=
her"
Be patient, those that do not yet have a box. We will do all we can to=
 help you obtain one.
