When one has been in the paranormal \n(=\r\nand Scientific) field as long as I have, one soon learns the difference \nbe=\r\ntween &quot;real&quot; and &quot;healthy Skepticism&quot; and  people who put on a fake \n&quot;skept=\r\nical&quot; persona in an effort to assuage their emotional issues and \nfears.\n  =\r\n Not all Scientists who Call themselves &quot;scientists&quot; are scientists. Ya \ngo=\r\ntta admit , the subject of ghosts, spirts, etc. is pretty darn scary, if \ny=\r\nour only contact with it is what you learn from kids stories and 1950&#39;s \nho=\r\nrror movies.  Who wants to live in a world with stuff like that lurking \nar=\r\nound in dark rooms and closets?.  Most people as children learn to sleep \nw=\r\nith the lights off by desperately wishing &quot;there are no ghosts&quot; until \nthey=\r\n finally&quot; believe&quot; it.\n\n  Is it any wonder why MANY people (including the s=\r\nupposedly educated) \nreact emotionally and fearful when someone brings up p=\r\naranormal subject \nmatter in a serious context?  Denial is the only defense=\r\n that they had \ndeveloped as a child.  To even study the truth and read an =\r\nauthoritative \nbook on the subject is a scary prospect for such people, so =\r\nthey usually \nstay in a relatively ignorant state in these matters, and nev=\r\ner grow away \nfrom the need of such an emotional defense. \n\n Only an intell=\r\nectually honest person who can separate himself from his \nemotions and has =\r\na thirst and drive for finding out the truth about what \nman does not yet k=\r\nnow about can make a good Scientist. Education (on the \ncurrent  state of a=\r\nffairs) is not enough.  A real and constructive \nSkepticism is also part of=\r\n being a Scientist as is the ability to change \none&#39;s opinion should the ev=\r\nidence warrant it.  A  Pseudo-Skeptic can&#39;t do \nthat no matter how overwhel=\r\nming the evidence may be--if they are exposed \nto any evidence at all.  The=\r\ny know if to accept the things that frighten \nthem as being &quot;legit&quot; they co=\r\nuld find themselves up all night with the \nlights on sucking their thumbs.\n=\r\n\nI like the quote (it think its by Coleridge)  &quot;that it is impossible to \nr=\r\neason a man out of a position he was never reasoned into in the first \nplac=\r\ne&quot;\n\nTOM\n\n\n\n\n\nMichelle Ayers &lt;diver4skynsea@...&gt; \nSent by: EVP-ITC@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com\n03/04/2010 11:50 AM\nPlease respond to\nEVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n\n\n=\r\nTo\n&quot;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\ncc\n\nSubject\nRe: [EVP=\r\n-ITC] What the skepdicks r missing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWow, Tom...excellent way to sort=\r\n and define the differences.
