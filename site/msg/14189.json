If the file=\r\n&#39;s content integrity is changed, that is, by definition, changing the bytes=\r\n.  If the bytes in there are not changed, then that integrity has not chang=\r\ned.\n\n        It is possible to mess with other things about a file (like it=\r\ns name, its suffix, or its ownership) but this does not effect the contents=\r\n, and so would not affect that integrity, or the sound of the file (assumin=\r\ng you could read it at all after changing the ownership, or the suffix, etc=\r\n).\n\n        When you do your tests, if you cannot do a bit level comparison=\r\n, I would recommend at least checking the file sizes.  If they are identica=\r\nl, there is a very high probability that the content has not changed.\n\n\n\n\n =\r\n       --- On Sun, 5/10/09, April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombieghostresear=\r\nch.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n          From: April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombieghostr=\r\nesearch.com&gt;\n          Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules-ATTENTIO=\r\nN JON\n          To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n          Date: Sunday, May 10,=\r\n 2009, 2:28 PM\n\n\n\n          Admittedly I do not know much about bit-level c=\r\nomparisons, what they can or can&#39;t show so I will have to leave that to you=\r\n.

An audio file is just a file of bytes, that is later i=\r\nnterpreted by an audio player.  Two files with the exact same contents, whe=\r\nther they are audio or image or a dababase or an exe, are indistinguishable=\r\n from each other.  That is, if I copied the contents of one to a new file, =\r\nand the contents of the other to a new file, and asked you which file each =\r\ncame from, there would be no way to tell.  Even the audio player could not =\r\ntell.  The data is identical, and so the sound (or the picture, etc) would =\r\nbe identical.\n\n                  Yes I did listen to the results, but that =\r\nis not the best test (they sounded identical, but that is a subjective opin=\r\nion).  The real test is compring the contents.  Identical contents means in=\r\ndentical data, means identical audio.\n\n                  It is probably pos=\r\nsible to set up an email compression scheme that does do lossy audio compre=\r\nssion.

For example, if I had a program in some .exe files, and I se=\r\nnt it over email, it could compress it.

A rough example would be if it found &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot; in a file=\r\n 20 times, it could replace all the occurances with say $HN1.

Imagine taking =\r\na picture of a field of flowers, and beginning to add levels or pixelizatio=\r\nn to the picture.  Soon, you would not be able to tell there were flowers t=\r\nhere at all.  You would see a lot of colored blocks.\n\n                     =\r\n           Or in the other direction, imagine you are looking at a competel=\r\ny randomize bunch of pixes on your screen: a complete screen of truely rand=\r\nom static snow.  Pixelizing this, after a while, you would again start to s=\r\nee colored blocks.\n\n                                What&#39;s happening is tha=\r\nt it is processing an area of the image, taking (for instance) the average =\r\nvalue of that entire area, and replacing all the blocks in that area with t=\r\nhe average.  In video processing, this would result in a field of multi-col=\r\nored flowers being replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish block, w=\r\nith no resemblance to flowers.  In the noise example, it maybe replace all =\r\nthe random pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.  If you did not kn=\r\now beforehand what the original picture was, you couldn&#39;t tell whether your=\r\n pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a chevy, the sky with cloud=\r\ns, or a random bunch of pixels.\n\n                                It works t=\r\nhe same with the sound files.
