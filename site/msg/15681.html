Now I know why earlier today, a strong male voice came over my RS  20-125, 
saying; "Computer!"  I went in my room later, and found that one of  the 
Macaws tore off the space bar on my PC, it' works barely, now I got to get  
another one.  If I had jumped when they told me too, I would have got there  in 
time.  These spirits are good, and really helpful friends.  They  now can 
turn off the radio when they want, sometimes they put it on a station  
relevant to whatever we were talking about, strange isn't it?  They also  turned 
it on,sf
