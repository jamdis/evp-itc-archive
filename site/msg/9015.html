Margaret,
 
Ron Is a friend and these comments where not directed toward h=
im.
I also own a mini box and am happy with it.
 
The difference is, when t=
he minibox was introduced for sale at 399.00 which is what I paid.
You coul=
d not obtain one any cheaper and Ron was not trying to exploit the needs an=
d desires of "new" researchers
in the field. If I'm not mistaken he has rep=
eatedly said that the minibox was primarily meant for experienced researche=
rs and 
paranormal investigating teams. And I believe he actually took a lo=
ss on the minibox.
 
On the other hand what you have on ebay are unscrupulo=
us individuals who see that they can pick up an item for 24.99
open it and =
cut a wire which takes about ten seconds from beginning to end. and then do=
uble the price plus shipping.
 
There is a name for it, I believe it is PRI=
CE GOUGING when there is a short or none existent supply of something and 
=
there are people or companies that hold some pieces of the product and sell=
 it at inflated prices to unwary individuals that feel a need to have it.
 =

In my book they are no more than thieves without guns. And should never be=

Hi Bruce. That's wonde=
rful your are in a financial position to be so generous. :-) I don't know i=
f we can really go so far as to say that people who buy from eBay are recei=
ving units with the wrong kind of energy attached, just because profiting f=
rom sales isn't a course of action you or I, nor some others would take. If=
 that is the case, where do we draw the line? I paid a hefty price for my M=
iniBox, as have many others. I'm sure there is some profit involved there. =
The energy of it seems just fine to me and I hold no disregard toward Ron f=
or recognizing there is a market for his devices.Perhaps those who log onto=
 eBay looking to find something so they can experiment with automated sweep=
 feel it's their lucky day when they discover such a listing? Maybe they ev=
en feel it's a 'sign' that it's the right thing for them to do some researc=
h. And as far as the seller is concerned, we don't know what their attitude=
 or motivation is, unless we know them personally. Reminds me of a person o=
n the cleaning crew who used to steal the food from the fridge at one of my=
 corporate jobs. Everyone was so harsh and judgmental about it, until one d=
ay, we learned she was feeding her hungry children!Even if the person selli=
ng the units is the most greedy person in the world, I fully believe it is =
far more the attitude and intention of the person conducting the experiment=
s which influence the energy of communication devices, than the attitude of=
 the people selling the devices. It's my opinion WE are the ones who attrac=
t what comes through to us on our equipment, much more so than the equipmen=
t itself. Margaret--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday <paranorma=
