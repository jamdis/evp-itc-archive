With this its just on no station, recording what sounds like nothing or the occasional buzz whoosh that comes thru. Frank will have to be the one to explain the difference in detail he knows alot more about the subject when it comes to how his box functions.\n\nI know some have had loud conversations using DRV I think theres even a youtube video of someone doing that. But I did not hear them like a broadcast the way they did, I didnt hear them at all until I played it back and was surprised to hear our names and speaking directly to me or my friend. Its interesting. It would be nice to get to that level of clarity that some claim to have had. I do believe the possibility exists to expand in many areas and this will just be one more I will be adding to my agenda.\n\nMisty\n\n\n--- On Sat, 8/30/08, threadsintyme@... &lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: threadsintyme@... &lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] DRV - Direct Radio Voice recordings\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Saturday, August 30, 2008, 9:46 PM\n&gt; I was wondering what the difference between the DRV sessions\n&gt; and a recording made through the &quot;Frank&#39;s\n&gt; Box&quot;, or any other box might be? \n&gt; Thank YOU!\n&gt; Al\n&gt; \n&gt; -- &quot;Misty&quot; &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I did a DRV session last night and I just wanted to share\n&gt; some of the \n&gt; results with the group. They came thru quite clearly even\n&gt; tho they had \n&gt; some difficulty making the link to where I was tuned off\n&gt; station in \n&gt; the &quot;dead&quot; zone. I usually start and end my sweep\n&gt; sessions off station \n&gt; but they had been coming thru quite clear there so last\n&gt; night I did the \n&gt; entire session that way.
