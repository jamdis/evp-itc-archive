It has a built-in speaker, so unlike the 12-469 or \nthe 12-820, you wouldn&#39;t have to worry about adding one in order to hear.  Though I can \ncertainly understand what it&#39;s like to not have an extra $45 to spend.  ;-)\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;darkstarwolf2002&quot; &lt;darkstarwolf2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; quick question to anyone who may have info on area&#39;s of interest \n&gt; regarding Alcatraz. We will be doing a investigation there starting may \n&gt; 17th.. unfortunatly no box yet. It would be a  pretty cool experience \n&gt; if we had one to experiment with but lol being broke all of our money \n&gt; will be going towards the investigation\n&gt;"}
