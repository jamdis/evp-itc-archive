loaded to EVP-ITC




Thanks for the info, Bruce. I guess because I use suc=
h a wide variety of digital recorders, techniques, software, and settings, =
what I'm looking for is a way to catalog the session clips along with the d=
etails. This is not counting the MiniBox, 12-469, 12-470, either of my manu=
al sweep radios, or EVP Maker. So, like yourself, I too have much more than=
 "one box" to keep track of. I also have a variety of cameras/settings used=
 for ITC images. LOL - I'm in definite need of something "fancy." ;0)If I c=
an recall what the file is named, I can use the "spotlight" feature on my M=
AC to find it, though often the content of a single file is much longer tha=
n I could possible name it. For example, my recent results with EVP Maker/S=
peakJet Allophones. I do jot some things down in a Mead notebook, but even =
that can be a chore to go through when I'm wanting to find information that=
 is older.For example, without electronic organization, I can pull up a fil=
e and recall that I used Diamond Cut Live6/Forensics software, but if I can=
't refer to some kind of notes, there is no way I can recall what the speci=
fic settings were unless the session was recent and still fresh in my mind =
(and/or the notes easily found.)What I'm wanting is some kind of simple dat=
abase. It's looking more and more like I'm just going to have to buy the so=
ftware and create it. If I do, I'll be sure to share the template with othe=
rs who might also be interested.Margaret--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bru=
