You know like the K2 they used to &quot;supposedly&quot; (jury is still out) talk to ghosts but cheaper.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well as an EMF sensor, I expected a number of things to set it off.&nbsp; 2 things:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) Hardly anything did set it off.&nbsp; I was amazed by this.&nbsp; I had to set it directly on my laptop to even pick up the 60 hz from the fans.&nbsp; This surprised me.&nbsp; I had expected it to go nuts with all the wireless this and wireless that, TVs, TIVOs and laptop.&nbsp; Anyway I thought it was interesting the level of shielding these days.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) and my real point.&nbsp; We had a big thunder storm come through last night.&nbsp; I turned it\n on expecting it to go off when nearby lightning strikes hit.&nbsp; The amazing thing was that it would go off when there was no lightning and no thunder.&nbsp; But some really close strikes did nothing but barely move the needle.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I&#39;m not exactly looking for answers but I was surprised about the storm.&nbsp; Next storm I&#39;ll have to see if it goes off a little before a big strike.&nbsp; It seemed like minutes to me between them but I was not paying that much attention.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So, sorry for the off-topic but I did warn you ahead of time so you could just delete.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;BTW if anyone has any ideas on that part 2, I&#39;d love to hear it but it probably needs to be direct email instead of to the list.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Don&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-589822742-1226460398=:60010--"}
