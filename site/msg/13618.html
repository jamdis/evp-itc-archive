Hi BarbaraI'm a member but I have not been good about going to their site.  If I get back to work by June maybe I can tag along and come too. I have family in Iowa and Nebraska.  The other side of Iowa..LOL Small world isn't it.

 
Regards,
Jon in Texas

Hi Jon,

April and I have only ever met through the AGS group, so I've lacked the opportunity to get led into too much trouble.  I'm up in western Illinois, very near Iowa.  If anyone in the group is going to the AGS conference in Decatur Illinois in June, I'll be there with a bunch of investigating buddies from Mercer County Paranormal Investigations.

It's good to meet you!

Barb
