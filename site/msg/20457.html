<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Steve,

I know it&#x27;s been brutal up your way. I don&#x27;t know how you are getting around in all that. I think most of the US is having a tougher winter than normal. Down here they closed many businesses and all the schools because it &quot;might&quot; snow a few weeks ago. I&#x27;m originally from NYC, so that kind of thing really blows my mind.

Where I am now only gets snow once every 5 years or so, but this year was the second year in a row that we got some. It usually doesn&#x27;t get below freezing at night until February, but this year it started in December. 

I&#x27;ll keep my eyes open for your email.

&gt; Cold?  I&#x27;ll trade you any day for this aweful NJ weather.  We are getting pummeled, one storm after another.
&gt; 
&gt; Always at least a foot of snow on the ground accompanied with ice.  The temps never get out of the teens and 20&#x27;s either.
&gt; 
&gt; Aaaaarrrgh !!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; As for the box, sweeps change but the idea stays the same.  Meet the new box, same as the old box. (Sung to The Who&#x27;s music)
