<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Here is some of a blog I wrote after my first experience with the TTTD
or Frank&#x27;s Box in March 2007:

March 13, 2007
Chris turned on a machine that was the size of a CB Radio. The
acoustics were poor in the room and many people moved closer to
listen. The first person stepped up to the mic and announced that he
was Jason Lewis from Atlanta and asked to speak to his father.

Suddenly we begin to hear voices coming out of this small blue box.
It&#x27;s a bit hard to discern what is being said at first then we hear
clearly &quot;Does he know I&#x27;m dead?&quot; Jason confirms that it is the voice
of his father. He begins to ask other questions and a short 2-way
conversation begins. Jason moved closer to the machine to hear a
little better. At times Chris would ask &quot;Technicians assist&quot;. The
technicians are those spirits skilled at communication and helping
those spirits who find it difficult.

At this point, I am bawling. There is a constant stream of tears
running down my face and I begin to look around at the others in the
room. I see a man crossing himself, people grabbing napkins to wipe
the tears, and I feel an intensity in the room that I am not sure I
have ever experienced before.

I start thinking &quot;Can this be real? Are we really communicating with
the other side in real time?&quot; If this was some sort of set up he would
have to have people stationed somewhere listening in with headphones
and responding to the questions. Later I spoke with people who
confirmed that some of the messages received were about things that
nobody could have known.

A local Atlanta woman stepped up to ask a question about her daughter.
Suddenly a loud and clear voice from device said &quot;Henry.&quot; Nobody there
but the woman and Chip knew that Henry is a man that Chip channels
when he does readings for Rebecca. The voice went on to tell her to
please get a second opinion about her daughters health.

Another woman asked to speak with the spirit of her neice. The
technicians advised that she wasn&#x27;t able to speak because she was
earthbound. They also advised that the woman go back to &quot;the place&quot; to
help her cross over and that she was the only one the neice trusted to
do that. As the woman walked away trying to control herself another
voice differant than the technicians came through. It said &quot;Help me.&quot;
Speaking with the woman afterwards she told me that her neice had
committed suicide by hanging. No one else in the room, besides her
good friend, knew that.

Most everyone in the room slowly made their way to the line to ask
their question. Everyone was anxious and everyone was crying.

I can not begin to put in words the intensity of energy in the room.
It was if we had all been stripped of everything but a raw emotion. It
was an incredibly spiritual event and I felt like we were all
connected. It was a miracle in every essence of the word.


2 days later I wrote again:

March 15, 2007
Many of us who attended Sunday have now moved into that caution stage.
From what I understand, not all communications from the &#x27;box&#x27; are as
loving as what we witnessed. Some have been downright scary.

Just because it has been built and it works (I do believe that this
does work and that it is not a hoax or just random noises that we are
making into intelligent words) does not mean that it is all good. I
think the potential is there for both good and bad, equally.

Is this the new hands free Ouija board? Does this act as a portal to
whoever wants to use it to enter our dimension? I see this becoming so
addictive to those battling depression and suffering the loss of a
loved ones. A good medium will not allow someone grieving to seek
their services time and time again as it prohibits healing. Now we
have the equivalent of free long distance to the departed. No rollover
minutes are required. If this device is used on investigations I do
believe all other protocol would be thrown out the window. It is
currently being used to help in cold cases. What&#x27;s to prevent a
malicious entity to frame an innocent person or just completely
leading law enforcement in the wrong direction?

In the infamous words of Chip Coffey &quot;We don&#x27;t know what we don&#x27;t know.&quot; 

One month later, after attending an event at The Stanley Hotel in Co.
I recounted my next experience:

April 17, 2007
My first experience with the TTTD was in Savannah. It was such a
powerful and emotional experience for me and I walked away forever
changed as a result. Once I returned home, much discussion occured as
to what exactly happened and what is this box. Good, bad... etc.
Fast forward to The Stanley. I decided that rather than join in on the
investigations either night, I would experience the TTTD again. My
goal was to not allow myself to become emotionally involved but, to
watch the dynamics and energy of those attending. Ever since I was a
young girl, I have been interested in the enrgy of people and it&#x27;s
effect on the environment. I had thoughts and ideas and I wanted to
validate those. I think I did.
After the Stanley Event, this is what I have decided. Not only is the
facillitator of the box important, so are those others present. The
energy in Savannah was so positive, the vibrational levels incredibly
high, little to no &quot;bad&quot; could come through. Colorado was differant.
Those attendees had not only probably heard the recent discussions but
also had just left a presentation by Demonologist Adam Blai. Fear and
confusion entered that room. I watched people both nights and as each
raffle ticket number was called the energy shifted and lowered. I
could &quot;hear&quot; the thoughts of people as time and time again their
number was not called. There was little to no emotional support for
peers happening. And what came through the box, though only a small
percentage was completely &quot;negative&quot;, it was no comparison to the
messages received in Savannah.
Now, on to Spirit Faces... I bought this book thinking that the entire
book would be about the Illuminator and the polaroids Mr. Macy is
taking. I was wrong. Many portions validate, synchronistically, the
thoughts about the TTTD that have mostly consumed me since Savannah.
Here are a few excerpts:

(pg 32) Speaking of a communication from the spirit of Konstantin
Raudive through radio sounds, Konstanin says &quot;It can only work when
the vibrations of those present are in complete harmony, and when
their aims and intentions are pure.&quot;

(Pg 80) On Contact Fields ( On communication from spirits through ITC
that say ITC depends on contact fields or a pool of life energy
composed of the thoughts and attitudes of all researchers involved
(both living and spirits) in an ITC project): &quot;When everyone&#x27;s
thoughts are in harmony, the contact field is clear. They can see into
our world and work with our equipment. But, if there is dissonance in
the form of fears, doubts, and animosities, the contact field becomes
cloudy, and it is impossible for them to see into our world and work
with us. That&#x27;s when negative spirit groups close to the earth in
vibration can break into existing bridges, with troubling results.
Troubled feelings seem to open the field to troubled spirit worlds as
they close down the field to the finer worlds.&quot;

(Pg 81) &quot;Resonance is a state of going with the flow. When vibration
is synchronized, less and less energy is required to excite the
system. Pure resonance allows a system, once vibrating, to keep
vibrating indefinitely.&quot;

More is said that I feel speaks directly to both the above and a
successful future for the TTTD and those using it but, I realize not
only how long this is but the fact that I&#x27;m sure none of this is
original thought. For me, it is incredibly exciting and validating to
what I hold as my personal truth.</pre>
