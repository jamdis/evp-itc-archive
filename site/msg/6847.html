<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ann,
 
I have come to the conclusion it is that when I receive a response
like &quot;wait&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;ll ask&quot; or &quot;not yet&quot; in response to asking for 
contact with 
another spirit other than a tech. The spirit that is asked for comes 
through 
in one of two ways depending on what spiritual plane that individual 
spirit resides on.
 
I have been able to discern from communications with mike and Lisa 
that there exists
more than one spiritual plane, the first is where our spirit awakens 
after making the 
transition from the physical. this is supposedly the only plane that 
communication with 
the physical world is capable of being sent from.
 
When a spirit moves from this first plane to the next changes in the 
enlightenment of the spirit take place.
The details pertaining to that are to complex to receive with our 
rudimentary equipment, evidently it can not be
explained in short phrases or sentences. which is completely logical.
 
To get back to the question, when a researcher asks for a spirit to 
be brought forward so they can communicate.
The tech must locate that spirit energy and summon it to the place 
where the communication is facilitated.
If the spirit has moved on to a higher plane of existence it must 
travel back to this lower plane to communicate.
 
Apparently spirits that have moved up can return to the lower 
spiritual planes but spirits that have not yet
ascended to a higher plane can not advance.
 
I am assuming that when a spirit is called by a tech to communicate 
with the physical if it is possible it will 
journey to the communication point. If it is not possible for the 
spirit to come to that point for whatever reason
I expect that they try to form a communication link from one point to 
another, and the tech must act as a telephone operator if you will.
 
that is the best way I understand how to explain it, I hope it 
answers your question Ann.
