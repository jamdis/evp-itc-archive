I like the sound of the copper one.  :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  I wanted to compare the two boxes, I just finished a galvanized \nsteel box, that scrap \n&gt; metal I get from work. I did the same as the copper box, try to \nselect the best sounding \n&gt; speaker for it. The use it with #33. I like the steel box better, \nI think last night, the clearer \n&gt; voices had more to do with conditions thant he equipment. Or--\ncould it be the other way \n&gt; around, tonights conditions are poor for either box? It gets \nfrustrating cuz ya can&#39;t nail the \n&gt; damn stuff down, it seems to defy any attempts at definition. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  I know, there was at least one person scrambling to make a \ncopper box, that&#39;s why I \n&gt; wanted more testing. I wish I could give some difinitive answers, \nbut there just doens&#39;t \n&gt; seem to be any.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  Then, get a voice that seems to be Raudive, I would expect some \nsignifgiant difference \n&gt; with the copper box, I&#39;m not hearing any thing any better. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  BTW, the mp3s are in my folder. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Back to work after babyhow do you know when you&#39;re ready?\n&gt; &gt; http://lifestyle.msn.com/familyandparenting/articleNW.aspx?cp-\n&gt; documentid=5797498&ocid=T067MSN40A0701A\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
