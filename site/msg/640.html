Hi Ryan
   
  I dont know much about them myself but I have heard of people using them.That is more up Frank's alley than mine. They have a variety of setups. I looked up a couple of links for you perhaps they will help.

of recieving a EVP recording? I was hard to get these dang diodes, but 
now i dont know what to do with them. I have a sodder gun and some 
wire, but no clue what to do with any of these parts yet. Also I had 
some questions about the SpirtComm device and if anyone here is 
familiar with how to construct one (i would like to and already have 
the rough diagram available online).

Thanks
Ryan
