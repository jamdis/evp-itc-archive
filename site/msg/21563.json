How could they be causing any of  this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, May 23, 2011 at 11:00 AM, &lt;_SnowfireL@..._ \n&gt; (mailto:SnowfireL@...) &gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; David the tech says that HAARP and Fema are &quot;trying to cause mass  death&quot; \n&gt; and &quot;they are trying to cause an earth quake, but all they can do is  create \n&gt; all the massive rain&quot;  David says, &quot;God won&#39;t let them create an  madrid \n&gt; quake&quot;  at least i hope that&#39;s what i understood him to  say.  &quot;all haarp is \n&gt; getting is the rain&quot; they have been trying to play  God,&quot;  David the t. says \n&gt; that if i tell you guys, &quot;they won&#39;t believe  it&quot;  but, i got a big mouth so \n&gt; i have to tell you to be careful, many  people have loved ones that got \n&gt; killed or hurt last night.  You guys  know that what&#39;s going on in the world is \n&gt; not the norm.  sure this may  be spring and season for rain, but, not at \n&gt; this level, somethings  a  brew and it&#39;s not coffee. sf\n&gt;"}
