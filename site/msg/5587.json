I love the fact that \nthey seem to know so much as to what is going on in our personal \nlive, such as your pizza clip or Bruce&#39;s phone ringing clip.  As you \ntake a step back and look at the bigger picture as to what the true \nmeans are regarding the clips, we can assume that they acknowledge us \nmore than what we actually know.  By them comfirming facts here on \nthis plane and what we are experiencing at that moment is hugh for \nour research.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Just my thoughts!\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Juli\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;            They report on her. Barbara Simpson is a talk show host \nfrom San Francisco, she used to fill in for Art Bell eons ago. I used \nto get stuff on EVPmaker like &#39;Barbara Simpson--astral&#39;. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  There&#39;s alot more to ITC than getting a dead person&#39;s name, or \nsome techno guide, it can be amazing if ya don&#39;t prejudge what&#39;s \nsupposed to come thorugh, or block it by expectations. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;   Put your friends on the big screen with Windows Vista + Windows \nLive.
