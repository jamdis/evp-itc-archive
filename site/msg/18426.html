<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Once upon a time the cordless phones and baby monitors both operated in the
49 MHz part of the spectrum. It wasn&#x27;t unusual to be able to hear baby
monitors on cordless phones.

I also had a piece of ham radio equipment for the 6-meter band (50 MHz) that
would tune below that. I would listen to the phone conversations on the
cordless phones and also the baby monitors once in a while. But it got
boring fast!

&gt; I used to get one of my neighbors on the BM whenever she had a phone call.
&gt; Maybe, she used a cordless?
&gt; I never told her and I would listen in for fun sometimes.

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; One of my readers asked me what I thought about using a baby monitor for
&gt; EVP. Apparently there&#x27;s one that gets poor reviews at Amazon because it
&gt; seems to pick up voices from nowhere.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That sounds like a good candidate for EVP, etc... no pun intended.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I wanted to see if anyone on this list had talked about this, but Yahoo
&gt; Groups&#x27; search form isn&#x27;t working.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Has this been discussed? Tested?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Opinions?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheerfully,
&gt; &gt; Fiona
