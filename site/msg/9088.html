Amazing I take a =
weeks vacation and come back to 350 notes, and see this one.
 
Both of your=
 arguments are indeed accurate.
 
But it is an added bonus to the recipient=
 or customer to hear their loved one's voice on tape rather that by word of=
 mouth from a gifted clairaudient, clairvoyant, psychic person. That is the=
 icing on the cake.
 
What would bother me terribly is if any of us researc=
hers received a message from a spirit in which we could actually make conta=
ct with their loved one to send the tape, and then to try and charge the co=
ntactee for the recording. 
 
In my opinion if any of us receive such a mes=
sage with that clarity, we should send/give it to the contactee free of cha=
rge as doing so is in a sense a spiritual gift from the spirit to the conta=
ctee, and we are just the messenger.  I have been researching this concept,=
 and I myself hope to one day be able to receive clear and concise messages=
 which would enable me to contact the spirit's loved one to give them that =
message should they wish to receive it. And I gurantee you it will be free =
of charge.
 
Have any of you received on any occasion enough info from the =
spirits to be able to contact the loved one and give them the recording?

<DIV>Amazing I take a weeks vacation and come back to =
350 notes, and see this one.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Both of your argu=

<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>But it is an added =
bonus to the recipient or customer to hear their loved one's voice on tape =
rather that by word of mouth from a gifted clairaudient, clairvoyant, =
psychic person. That is the icing on the cake.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV=
>What would bother me terribly is if any of us researchers received a messa=
ge from a spirit in which we could actually make contact with their loved o=
ne to send the tape, and then to try and charge the contactee for the recor=
ding. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>In my opinion if any of us receive=
 such a message with that clarity, we should send/give it to the contactee =
free of charge as doing so is in a sense a spiritual gift from the spirit t=
o the contactee, and we are just the messenger.  I have been researchi=
ng this concept, and I myself hope to one day be able to receive clear and =
concise messages which would enable me to contact the spirit's loved one to=
 give them that message should they wish to receive it. And I gurantee you =
it will be free of charge.</DIV>
