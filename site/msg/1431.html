<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah Steve, I&#x27;m not real vocal to begin with but it has been
abnormally slow. I think everyone is real busy getting their ducks in
a row for the upcoming holiday.  Who knows? LOL 

Yeah, Rosemary wrote the articles for TAPS mag and its probably one of
the best portrayals of the Frank&#x27;s box there is. At least Rosemary
actually spoke with, witnessed and interviewed people who know a
little about this machine, to include Frank himself. Its nice to read
a positive, informed account rather than the guessing and stabbing in
the dark I have heard and written by ignorant naysayers.

Kudos Rosemary!

&gt; This is an incredible field and nobody has posted in days.  Just 
&gt; thought i&#x27;d throw it out there and maybe get somebody&#x27;s attention.  
&gt; I&#x27;ll have to post more files i guess to keep this going.  The box was 
&gt; in TAPS paramag, anybody read that?
