<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I get our last dogs from time to time, and used to get them via white
noise when I first started this. Last summer some kids came down into the
basement wiht the younger grandson, and the little yorkie barked, but &quot;get
outta here&quot; came out, some how.

 Yeah, I think I was too hard on RJ. I don&#x27;t know why, but testing doens&#x27;t
seem to work, but we get enough to prove this to ourselves. It&#x27;s probably a
faith thing, although I&#x27;m not religious, even anti-religion.

&gt; Here is a short file, where someone says, &quot;Scamp, Scamp,&quot; then Scamp barks.
&gt; &quot;yap.&quot;  This little dog belonged to my grandma, when I was about 9 or 10
&gt; years old, he was a Manchester Terrier, and lived with us for many years,
&gt; and this is his bark for sure.  I&#x27;d know that bark anywhere.  Sorry, that I
&gt; can&#x27;t make it any clearer, I need to get one of those better ghost boxes I
&gt; guess.  RJ, spirits are just like us, they are not omnipresent like
&gt; God,  probably why David doesn&#x27;t want to play the guessing game, he has
&gt; better things to do over there, and has said, they have thousands of people
&gt; standing in this long line waiting to get into the Heavens, and He can&#x27;t
&gt; just drop His job and go to your house to see what you have over there, He
&gt; did tell me that first time what it was, and i sent it to you, but it was
&gt; too late.  It&#x27;s hard for me to understand them sometimes, He was also right
&gt; about that little boy, Syler being killed, and where his body would be
&gt; found, I don&#x27;t know what they did about it though. sf
