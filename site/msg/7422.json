It is in fact the inspiration fo=\r\nr my boxes.  2-The Mini box by paranormalsystems.com. It&#39;s a direct output,=\r\n linear sweep system based on my boxes, and it does work.  3-Use the manual=\r\n sweep mathod, take a radio that can be tuned easily by hand, tune the dial=\r\n up and down slowly while recording directly from the speaker. Always annou=\r\nnce you are doing an EVP session before you start recording. Manual sweep w=\r\nas the basis for linear sweep that the Mini box uses, and that I have adopt=\r\ned for my boxes, and was first developed here on this group.  3- Foreign la=\r\nnguage-Tune in a short wave broadcast in a language you don&#39;t understand, a=\r\nnd record directly from the speaker of the radio. You can also use an inter=\r\nnet foreign language boroadcast for the same purpose. See coffeepotghost.co=\r\nm for more information.  4-Radio between stations as a source of white nois=\r\ne. I like to pick a night when there lots of skip, stations fadding in and =\r\noput randomly, this is a great source of raw audio. You&#39;ll have ignore the =\r\ncritics that cliam you&#39;re only hearing broadcast fragments, you hav eto jud=\r\nge the result by meaning, that is, does the message mean anything personall=\r\ny?   I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other methods out on the web. I suggest peole start w=\r\niht white noise, and work your way up. \n \n There is nothing magical about t=\r\nhe boxes, it&#39;s a swept radio, nothing more. It provides a higher level--lou=\r\nder--audio that spirits use to make voices, that is all it does!   I usuall=\r\ny do not ask questions when I do sessions, I think that biases the mind int=\r\no expecting, and maybe even creating the answers one wants the hear. I rely=\r\n on the guides to give me what I need. I also don&#39;t do &quot;investigations&quot;, ag=\r\nain I think it biases your mind into creating what you want. I really doubt=\r\n there is any haunting if no one is there to experience it.   I know---what=\r\n I say is to be dismissed as it doesn&#39;t jive with the Hollywood version of =\r\nthe paranormal.
