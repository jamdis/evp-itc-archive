<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rees,

if the error occurs only on your laptop but not on your other PC, it&#x27;s
possible that your PC&#x27;s soundcard doesn&#x27;t support the sample parameters
(sample rate, bits) of that wav file (which I suppose had been created
on the laptop, right?). Did you try to play the same wav file in another
audio program than EVPmaker on your PC?

&gt; I have got a problem with my EVP maker.  I clicked on the yellow play 
&gt; button, and I got a Wave out Error that says &quot;The specified format is 
&gt; not supported or can not be translated.  Use the Capabilities function 
&gt; to determine the support formates&quot;.  Then I thought since I had wave 
&gt; pad open that was the problem, but I shut wave pad down.  Its still is 
&gt; saying the same thing.  I am trying to use it on Windows 2000 
&gt; Professional on my Home cpu.  Please let me know if there is away I can 
&gt; fix my problem.  

&gt; EVP maker works on my laptop, but not my home cpu.

&gt; Thanks
