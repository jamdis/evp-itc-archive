  File        : /Jim&#x27;s RR-DR60 EVP&#x27;s/Jim_Salonika_Hanukkah-2-evp.mp3 
  Uploaded by : clockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt; 
  Description : Went to Glendale Cemetary today (Des Moines-Iowa) Stopped at two Mausoleums. Got one evp...man said &quot;were dead&quot;, I also went over to the Jewish Burial Site. I asked to have an Elder or someone with an accent to speak so I could have some proof. I get this EVP. It says &quot;Jim &gt;Salonika &lt; Hanukka&quot; Now I&#x27;m NOT positive it says &quot;Solonika&quot; but I tried to use &quot;savonika&quot; (spelled it something like that) and Google gave the Salonika suggestion. But I do know it says &quot;JIM.........HANUKKAH&quot;.
