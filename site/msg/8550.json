Does anybody have a logical explanation yet?  Energy \n&gt; fields, Conincidence...etc.\n\nWell, there are a lot of explanations for this, but none of them has\nbeen proven yet (afaik). I tend to the &quot;synchronicity&quot; explanation - at\nleast when pure logical devices such as computers are used, which I\nbelieve can&#39;t be influenced mentally, neither by spirits nor by humans\n(otherwise they would probably crash more often than already without\nsuch a manipulation). ;)\n\nI think that causal models aren&#39;t sufficient to explain EVP. If no\ndevices are influenced directly, there must be taking place some other\nform of &quot;manipulation&quot;. Perhaps the &quot;probability field&quot; is manipulated\nsomehow in cases where random number generators (RNG) are involved? As\nwe know from psychokinesis experiments in parapsychological labs, test\npersons were able to get &quot;hits&quot; even when &quot;prerecorded targets&quot; are used\ninstead of a RNG. It seems that time and causality doesn&#39;t matter in\nrespect to paranormal phenomena.\n\nStefan"}
