I&#39;ve been sitting on this for about three weeks, uncertain if \nI wanted to create more controversy, and demand for boxes. The sweep \ncircuit is the linear sweep, in my instructions, very simple to make, \nand the radio is out of a car stereo. One could probably just build \nthe minimum, just the sweep circuit, and the car tuner, then use a \nstereo boom box for everything else, or computer speaekers, \nor......the possibilities are endless. \n\n I ahve another board all made for random, linear, and manula sweep \nmodes, ans stereo outputs. BTW, this one has stereo speakers in the \necho box, but only a single mic at this time. \n\n Frank"}
