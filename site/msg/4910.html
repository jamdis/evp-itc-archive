<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce--I listened to them all, every single one that got posted  
yesterday.

I didn&#x27;t comment because I didn&#x27;t find this batch to be as strong as  
yours usually are. Although I meant to post and say that I was quite  
sad that the Elvis we heard might be an impersonator. Would you ask  
them why they allow a fake to come through--since that EVP was quite  
long and elaborately &quot;staged,&quot; for lack of a better term. Surely Mike  
could stop a fake? I&#x27;m very curious about what&#x27;s happening over there  
as we are operating the box, and it is very important to me to feel a  
good amount of certainty that the people coming through are who they  
claim to be. If you can ask, I&#x27;d be grateful. I don&#x27;t seem to be able  
to get those kind of responses yet on my own.

&gt; yesterday I posted like 20 files and did not recieve one reply on any
&gt; of them.
&gt;
&gt; Yet a post about a broken cell phone recieves a hundred replies.
&gt; What is this group about?
&gt;
&gt; Frank is right what the hell is the sense of posting files to an  
&gt; EVP-ITC
&gt; group if no one pays attention to the evp&#x27;s or files that are posted.
&gt;
&gt; I admit I do not reply to every single post myself but I do try and
&gt; reply to most.
&gt;
&gt; If no one is even bothering to listen to the files you are really
&gt; missing what this is all about.
&gt;
&gt; Come o9n guy&#x27;s this is supposed to be about the exchange of ideas and
&gt; constructive suggestions on evp-itc research. It&#x27;s not a chat board or
&gt; a forum for personal vendeta&#x27;s
&gt;
&gt; Let&#x27;s get with the program and do some evp work.
&gt;
&gt; And I&#x27;ll bet I get some replies to this post that&#x27;s for sure !
