There is the same distinct voice that\nsays, &quot;Get out&quot;....... and &quot;You think I&#39;m stupid&quot;.  Those are loaded\non our website, but we do have several others taken from here that are\nof this same deep dark voice.  \n\nMy sister thinks that I am crazy for wanting to live in this house\nhere, our family home that we have dubbed &quot;The RIPS HQ&quot;............. I\nam not afraid of any of this, and feel that since I have grown up in\nthis home and now own it that this is a very weak power or otherwise\nwelcomes us all in some sordid way?  What&#39;s all of you&#39;re take on this\nvoice here?  Just wondering and I would really appreciate any feedback\non these........... thanks, Kay from The RIPS. \n\nhttp://www.the-r-i-p-s.com/evps.htm"}
