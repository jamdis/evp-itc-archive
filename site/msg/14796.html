There are alot of people who would like Frank to make a box for them (
incl=
uding me).
I think we would all furnish whatever he needed or just purchase=
 a box
from him.
Frank doesn't want to sell anything that is not perfected,=
 but none of
this is a guarantee
that you will get some kind of spirit comm=
unication.
I wonder if Chris Moon has thought about how his profits are goi=
ng to
decline if Frank
makes boxes to sell ?

		Exactly my point... You don't charg=
e anything for the
boxes
		and Chris Moon charges people for using it....
	=
	If it's not perfected then Chris shouldn't charge
either......
		If he was=
n't so public with it, then people like me
wouldn't dislike him so much.
		=
 
		The only people that have your boxes (that the public
hear about)
		are=
 the well known paranormal groups and famous people.
		I am sure that you h=
ave given boxes to researchers who
are not in the popular
		paranormal comm=
unity ,and don't want to be. Those are
the ones that should

 And of course YOU are well respected by us

Moon and how
		alot of people thinks he sucks. And everyone wants=
 a
box......
		But you have to expect that. You are the only one out
there =
that is honest and
		doesn't want to be famous.
