That's just the curse of being psychic. It's hard to self monitor your 
progress before presenting it publicly when your perception is different 
than most other people's.  But even being able to hear message clearly 
yourself is a step in the right direction.  I know that's something I 
couldn't have done myself 10 years ago.

Don't think you're just spinning your wheels when the experiments don't 
work out right, though.  We all learn from the failed experiments as 
well as the ones that worked right.  It all goes to help in the long 
run.  There are other benefits as well.  Frank's Box has been helpful to 
the research in that it alone has created a buzz in the paranormal 
community that has drawn in a lot more researchers .  I don't remember 
hearing that kind of excitement about EVP Maker despite how impressive 
the results from that have been. I'm pretty sure that you are doing what 
you are meant to be doing in all this, even if you aren't making the 
kind of progress you'd like.
