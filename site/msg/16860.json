It&#39;s called a Soul Linx Ghost box (the \n&gt; &gt; back says radio shack).\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know how to communicate, all I get is plain old radio stations or \n&gt; &gt; static. Nothing else. I feel like I bought a radio & that&#39;s it. Idea&#39;s on \n&gt; &gt; what to do, please :(\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Denise\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
