Has option to slow the recording down. Another nice feature is that you can use either a highpass or lowpass filter (sometimes that is all that is needed) and changing the PITCH is a very handy tool. Always KEEP an original copy of your recordings. I just save a copy from inside audacity (to desktop or somewhere) then I will start my work on trying to clear it up. Save the original (and proceeding enhanced version(s) by using the &quot;file&quot; button at to left corner oif program. There you would SAVE &quot;selection&quot; as MP3.(To upload to here) or save to WAV (is bigger) but higher qulity. Can always convert the wav to mp3 from withing audacity also. *you will need to get the mps &quot;pluging&quot; from the website, and follow the information to install it &quot;manually&quot; (once is only needed) that way you get the mp3 converter program free. But really...Audacity is a pretty good program to have round. Has a nice &quot;undo&quot; fesature too, if you make a mistake.

In the  \n&gt; &quot;tomorr\n&gt; &gt; sure that it is a voice.

I can&#39;t make  out any clear words. Sure-I could probably \n&gt; &gt; matrix some in, but that  is all it would be.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For an EVP to be considered proof  positive of spirit communication by \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; community at large, it has to  be clear enough that many people hear the \n&gt; &gt; same thing, without hints  or coaxing. If you have to have high quality \n&gt; devices \n&gt; &gt; to make it out,  it just isn&#39;t good enough. That does not mean it isn&#39;t a \n&gt; &gt; true EVP,  just that it isn&#39;t good enough to stand as evidence.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As for  the whistle, it sounded like feedback to me as well, but I will \n&gt; &gt; have  to take you word for it that you were no where near any other \n&gt; electronics  \n&gt; &gt; or EMF&#39;s that could contribute to feedback. Even so, if I am trying  to \n&gt; &gt; remain unbiased and objective, there is no way for me to say this  is a \n&gt; spirit, \n&gt; &gt; without personally being with you when you caught it.  The only thing I \n&gt; can \n&gt; &gt; still say about it is could be, but for me it is  non conclusive.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If someone does not hear what you are  hearing, try to remain objective \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; just understand that it isn&#39;t  personal. You have to understand that with \n&gt; &gt; just these recordings  alone, there is no way to scientifically prove \n&gt; what \n&gt; &gt; you have recorded  is spirit communication. If you could get consistent, \n&gt; &gt; intelligent  question and answer recordings, then you would be alot \n&gt; closer.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Here again, we are back to the &quot;So what?&quot; thing. You don&#39;t HAVE to  prove \n&gt; &gt; anything scientifically, unless you want others to completely  believe in \n&gt; &gt; your evidence.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The theory that is being  kicked around is that some EVP&#39;s are personal, \n&gt; &gt; and only meant for the  person recording them to hear. If this is the \n&gt; case, no \n&gt; &gt; matter how  clear something is to you, others may not hear it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  April\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----  \n&gt; &gt; From: _James W.
