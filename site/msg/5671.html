Robin,
 
In the evp file you posted I believe I'm hearing "we want to kill=
 you"
please let me know if that is what you hear.
 
Robin, I am glad to he=
ar that the protection ritual will be utilized by you 
in the purpose it wa=
s intended. To give any individual that wants to an
opportunity to use it.
=
 
You will find many forms of interaction on this group, running the gamut =
from total agreement 
to calm debate /discussion. To full blown arguments. =

 
That is what makes a group, If everyone followed one single ideology and=
 the ideas of any single person without question
it would not be a group it=
 would be a cult.
 
Welcome to the wonderful world of box research robin, I=
'm sure you will be a valued member and researcher in this community.
 
Bru=
ce

I'm still giving this topic a lot of thought be=
cause I absolutely believe in the power of prayer, the power of positivity,=
 and the power of ritual.  When I first started recording EVP a couple of y=
ears ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when it happened to =
me I felt elated rather than frightened or distressed.  I will ask again:  =
What physical or psychic harm is a disembodied entity capable of doing?  Pl=
ease listen to the one EVP I've posted on this board and tell me what, if a=
nything, you hear.  I know what I hear, and I consider it distinctly threat=
ening; yet, this is the response that has created the determination in me t=
o continue researching the unknown.  
 
Bruce, I am in awe of your recordin=
gs.  I only want to learn as much as I can from you and the other dedicated=
 researchers on this board.  It never occurred to me to use a protection ri=
tual in the past, and that's about all I can say.  I will probably use one =
from this point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract goodness.=
  
 
So, thank you for this contribution.  I think the debate has been an e=
xcellent one, and I've appreciated the opportunity to be enlightened.

damned protection debate


I swore I would not get wraped up in this debate=
BUT!The reason I came up with this whole protection ritual was that some of=
 the new researchers whereexpressing a rational concern for negative respon=
ces that they were recieving through thier boxes.The short protection ritua=
l that I posted is not meant to quell irrational histerical fear, and I agr=
eewith rosemary that anyone suffering from such fear should rethink thier i=
nvolment in the paranormal research field.that being said, It was only mean=
t as a source of subliminal comfort to those new individuals that had never=
 expperienced spiritual negativity. And to help ease them into aproaching a=
 session eventually with confidenceand determination as well as full curiou=
sity for all types of the communication we recieve.My initial post of the r=
itual file was done with the best of intentions and meant to be another too=
l available for those who felt they needed or wanted to employ it. it is a =
simple innocent prayer ritual, I don't think it is really worthy of all thi=
s debate.Use it, don't use it. It's there if you want it. Also I must say t=
here are two kinds of fear the kind that is natural and a god given emotion=
 for self preservation, ie the fright and flight reflex that is an instinct=
ive trait in all of us. Then you have the irrational dibilitating phobic fe=
ar that can turn an individual into a frozen statue. That type of fear I be=
lieve is unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt with and learned how to=
 harness. I also believe that anyone that harbors that type of fear would n=
ot be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a case of such fear it would al=
ready be present and doing a small protection ritual would not fuel it any =
further. So lets take it for what it is, something to utilize in our box of=
 tools like an emf meter.you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the =
bottom of your tool box at home that you inherited from your grandfather an=
d have never usedbut if you come across that odd nut that needs tightening =
somedsy you will be glad you have it.Bruce
