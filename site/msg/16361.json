I have extremely high blood pressure and other concerns, so it\nis very important to me to lose the anxiety I feel about all this. I\nam so keyed up at times it is difficult to rest and recharge.\n\nI shared some private info in an off-list post to a member here who I\nhave confidence in. Some of that content touches on your remarks, so\nI&#39;m going to take a deep breath and go ahead and share the following\ninfo:\n\n---\n\nThe reason I&#39;ve been so concerned about the voices is that I\nencountered threatening communication while under quite a bit of\nstress -- I had to retire early from a long career ... because of failing\nhealth, low vision (doc predicted I\nwould go blind but surgery saved (I hope) my remaining vision), the\ndeath of my brother, etc. I began recording evps as a pastime but it\nescalated into hearing threats and then being able to hear the voices\nwith my unaided ears! Hearing them without a radio really freaked me\nout.\n\nThe character &quot;Luke&quot; said I had poked around and asked for &quot;their\nhelp&quot; and information, and that I owed payback. He said, &quot;Now you have\nbecome ours, and I will be there in court with you on the last day\narguing for it!&quot; etc. Very chilling stuff for someone who has\ndangerously high blood pressure problems and many other challenges.\n\nA different voice (not Luke) informed me one day that my brother\nWalter was gravely ill. I had not spoken with Walt for awhile, so I\ncalled right away and was told by my sister-in-law that Walt was in\nend stage kidney failure! It happened so quickly that the family hadn&#39;t had\ntime to inform me. Patt and I drove the hundred miles or so to his\nhome and got there in time to spend only three short days with him\nbefore he died! In that case, the voice did a good thing by letting me\nknow about my brother, but there have been times when the voices have\nbeen mocking and threatening or full of useless BS.\n\nFor example, I&#39;m now Catholic and I do some devotional prayers at\nbedtime as I sit near a shelf where I keep rosaries and prayer books.\nOne night the &quot;Luke&quot; fellow began speaking from my nearby pillow! I\nwas several feet away from the pillow at the time but could hear the\nvoice very distinctly. It was almost as if there was a speaker in the\npillow. Over the next several nights the voice would wake me up,\nmaking it difficult to sleep. I then called the priest and he returned\nto our home a second time to pray and bless the place with holy water\nand blessed salt. I now keep lots of holy water and blessed salt\naround -- I get the water from our church by the jug-full. Our house\n(which we lease) was built in about 1830 and restored several times.\nThe priest said it is possible for old objects and places to become\n&quot;infested&quot; with evil spirits. We don&#39;t know much about the history of\nthe house, but we do know for certain that a previous occupant used\nthe bedroom to do ceremonies of some type -- a huge pentagram was\npainted on the floor and the entire room was painted red. The owner\nhad a big repair job to correct it. The priest referred me to numerous\nspiritual warfare prayers, and I have been using those since that\ntime. Things have been fairly quiet for awhile, but the voices return\nvery frequently almost as if to remind us they&#39;re still around and\nthat there&#39;s nothing we can do to get rid of them. Our priest said\nsimply moving might not fix the problem, as the voices could follow.\nBecause I&#39;m on Social Security with only a tiny retirement supplement\nfrom my work, moving would be a hardship -- and we&#39;d be in a real fix\nif we moved and the voices came along too....\n\nThe encounter with the voice of &quot;Steve Tate&quot; lasted on and off over\nseveral days, then he just abruptly quit communicating. Most of the\nremaining voices laugh, mock, and taunt us.\n\nThe only &quot;useful&quot; or positive thing that resulted from any of this was\nmy being able to spend time with my brother before he died.\n\nWould you please give me your thoughts on this as to whether what I&#39;ve\ndescribed is the &quot;typical&quot; encounter and whether you believe it is\nharmful or springing from something &quot;demonic.&quot; I&#39;m a very\n&quot;cause-and-effect&quot; type of person who previously believed this sort of\nthing was impossible. Now I don&#39;t know what the truth is.\n\nYou know more that I do about this stuff and seem to have experience,\nand I would appreciate it very much if you can put things into context\nfor me -- I&#39;ll appreciate anything you can tell me, even if you just\nshare your theories.  In particular, do you know of any way to make\nthe voices hush?\n\n&gt; The priest in question was likely\n&gt; unqualified to perform a full exorcism, and your situation did not call for\n&gt; one. This is based on the teachings of the Catholic church and their\n&gt; official position on demons.\n\nCorrect. The bishop specifically directed me to a priest who holds a\ndoctorate and is\nknowledgeable but not &quot;experienced&quot; in exorcisms -- I&#39;m sure he has\nnever conducted an exorcism apart from the &quot;mini exorcism&quot; that&#39;s part\nof the baptismal rite. He conducted a mass at our home and then\nblessed the premises and said some warfare prayers. Now (several\nmonths later), our diocese does have an official, experienced exorcist\nbut I have not yet asked to meet with him and have been wondering if I\nneed to....\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I am surprised that Protestant pastors were unwilling to become involved.\n&gt; But you seem to have made a good try.\n\nI live in the Bible Belt and found it surprising that every single one\nof them wanted nothing to do with the situation or even to meet me in\nperson! Rather &quot;fair weather Christians,&quot; I thought.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; As you may know the general idea is that reaching out to the dead is\n&gt; considered turning away from the Deity and this is why most religions frown\n&gt; on things like clairvoyance and mediumship frankly.\n\nYes, that&#39;s right. &quot;Have no other gods,&quot; etc.\n\n&gt; As far as the state trooper, like Jill I too do quite a bit of online\n&gt; research and I happen to live in the NOVA area, only a few miles from where\n&gt; these events alledgely took place. I will ask around to see if there is any\n&gt; support for any of this story, going a bit beyond what is online.\n\nUnlike the other voices, Tate was very friendly and conversational and\nwe fell into a discussion that verged on being an &quot;interview.&quot; When I\nwas a young man, I worked as a daily newspaper reporter in Birmingham\n-- I&#39;ve conducted possibly thousands of interviews. I cut right to the\nchase -- who, what, when, where, etc. But we reached a point, when I\nasked &quot;where&quot; Tate was in relation to time and my physical location,\nthat we got cut off by an authoritative-sounding female voice that\nbasically called out to us in a stern tone. I tried to press on with\nthe conversation and &quot;she&quot; snapped at me and called me &quot;Mr. Harris&quot; in\nan angry / exasperated tone. I&#39;m paraphrasing, but Tate said &quot;they&quot;\n(&quot;over there&quot;) are monitored when they talk to us &quot;air-breathers&quot; and\nthat certain topics are forbidden. Tate called the monitors the &quot;head\ncounters.&quot; Tate&#39;s conversations were all recorded from the radio and\nthe quality of voice was as distinct and clear as anything else on the\nAM dial. Clearer, maybe. And the REALLY strange thing is, many chunks\nof his conversation took up several &quot;cycles&quot; of scans -- I mean, it\nwasn&#39;t in fragments most of the time!\n\n&gt; I have come to\n&gt; believe that a great deal of it has to do with the quality of the medium and\n&gt; their ability to get the information clear. This turns out to be a difficult\n&gt; task under the best of conditions. Many mediums, even the competent ones,\n&gt; have trouble separating themselves from the messages.\n\nI read somewhere, maybe on the ITC world site, that a theory is that\nthe equipment has less to do with it than the person&#39;s ability to pick\nit up. Now, this is very confusing in my case. Patt and I have heard\nthe voices with and without a radio, and we have heard them while\nsitting together and while we were separate. I am not imagining the\nvoices that come without aid of a radio because I can record them with\nmy Olympus digital recorder. This is probably the main thing that lets\nme know I&#39;m not going crazy or having a nervous breakdown.\n\n&gt; This brings me to what may be going on in your case. It would be good to\n&gt; know if others had heard the recordings (when they still existed) and agreed\n&gt; without prompting on their contents.\n\nYes! Most definitely -- others could hear the recordings and\nunderstand clearly what was said. In some cases it became difficult to\nunderstand particular words (was I hearing the name &quot;Tate&quot; or &quot;Pate&quot; ?\nMost of us decided it was &quot;Tate.&quot; Most of the time it was so clear\nthat my wife and a few close friends were totally creeped out! In\nfact, I had the recorder on one morning and I checked my e-mail and\nthen stripped for a shower, then took another glug of coffee before\nactually going into the bathroom. I began to realize that a female\nvoice was laughing and talking about me standing there naked!!! The\nevp voices always seemed so much faster-paced than &quot;real&quot; voices -- I\ngot to where I&#39;d upload them and play them back in Sound Forge so I\ncould slow it down. At a slower speed they sounded more normal. Is\nthis typical?\n\n&gt; What I am trying to determine here is\n&gt; whether or not the recordings were clear and contained unquestionable sounds\n&gt; or whether they were subject to interpretation.\n\nYes, more than 80 percent of the time they were clear and distinct.\nAnother creepy thing is that I accidentally found that I could play\nthem backwards in Sound Forge. Many, many times I found there were\nadditional messages when played in reverse! This stuff was so creepy\nthat the Bishop IMMEDIATELY gave permission for the priest to help.\nThe recordings never seemed to be subject to various interpretations.\nNow, I know this sounds really, really paranoid, but they were so\nclear that I actually looked around to see whether someone might have\nbeen spying on us and somehow transmitting their voice to our radio.\nAnd there was just no way. We live on top of a hill on 15 acres of\nthick pine forest and have a mean ole southern yard dog with a\ntrip-wire temper, so there is just no way I can think of that this\ncould have been a prank.\n\n&gt; I have suggested on this forum and elsewhere that at least some EVP may in\n&gt; fact be the production of the operator, informed perhaps by some external\n&gt; (and potentially discarnate) source. ....\n\nWell, I thought of that, but I went through phases, in much younger /\nhealthier times of life, when I experimented with clairvoyance and\ntelepathy and so forth, and I have never, not one single time, been\nable to correctly guess which card was pulled or come up with what\nanyone else was thinking or any of that. I am probably the most\nthick-headed non-esp type of person you&#39;d ever meet. My eegs are\nprobably flat lines.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you associate hearing these voices with a place or activity, beyond just\n&gt; recording? I ask that since you indicated that you had heard voices outside\n&gt; the EVP context. This might help understand the true source of the voices as\n&gt; well.\n\nThe only place I have ever heard the voices was in this house. A week\nor so after it started, I began hearing what I thought was &quot;chatter&quot;\nmixed in with the sound of running water at the kitchen sink, in the\nbathroom, etc. I noticed it at other places when I&#39;d &quot;take a leak&quot; at\na public restroom or elsewhere. I thought it was another sign I was\nlosing my mind. The water-talk has eased up. I never tried to record\nit and slow it down (afraid of what I might hear). For one thing, it\nis hard to use the bathroom and hold a recorder at the same time\n&lt;grin&gt;.\n\n&gt; I would suggest that you not record further if it makes you uncomfortable.\n&gt; Belief systems seem to play a significant role in this phenomena. That would\n&gt; suggest that you should do nothing that you feel uncomfortable with.\n\nYes, I came here hoping to find some answers I can understand and have\nfirmly resolved not to experiment further until I can understand\nwhat&#39;s happening.\n\nThanks very much for giving this issue your time and thought.\n\n-- \nAl\n\n&quot;Try again, fail again.
