Rod,

It's a shame that in "40 years" you have come to that conclusion. I c=
an see your viewpoint though. I was once a PI for a long time (longer than =
most of generation TAPS). Ghost hunters and paranormal investigators mostly=
 keep themselves separated from the entity they seek. You treat it like a l=
ab animal instead of a person. True most entities that are earthbound are o=
nly partly conscious, in a dream state or their realities have become twist=
ed and delusional. 

You don't see yourself as a "ghost in a shell" or bein=
g primarily spiritual in makeup. You see yourself as physical because that =
is the reality you are faced with at the moment.

The truth is Rod, a lot o=
f us here (as ITC researcher and afterlife researchers) have built relation=
ships with counterpart teams on the other side. We do have primary contacts=
 who refer to themselves with names. Some of us even have recording groups =
to help build this bridge to the other side.

Whether you believe this or n=
ot is of no consequence to me. If you wanna call people delusional, crazy o=
r living in a fantasy world, that is fine to. But if you continue to do so =
here you may find yourself not being a part of this forum anymore because i=
ts counterproductive and negative.

Many of us here have accepted the exist=
ence of the very things you poke fun at and we need no further proof. Do no=
t make the mistake of thinking these are beliefs or ideas, acceptance is di=
fferent. Our mission is to strengthen those bonds we or they have initiated=
 and to teach others to make the connection to evolve spiritually.

Regards=
,

Frank R.

I certainly agree with the point of Bruces' statement,  bu=

g some inter-action between a box and the user,  not letting one work,  the=
 box chosing it's owner,  etc., etc., etc.  In the first place Ghosts are N=
ot our Friends!  That's pure, unadulterated Fantasy.
  The Ghosts do not ha=
ve the where-with-all to accomplish this in the first place, and even if th=
ey did they don't give a rats' rear end what a Ghost Hunter does or doesn't=
 do.  That boy really needs to get real.  Ghosts simply do not re-act to th=
e living in that way, or much of any other way except to allow us to see or=
 hear them and then only when they want it to happen.  Their most obvious a=

that
 you have to have a certain amount of experience with box=

someone with the wrong intentions to develop a working tool for
