&gt;     Sorry to hear that Frank. I can think of plenty of actual
&gt;     researchers who would love to test one and are already getting
&gt;     great results with other methods and versions of your work. I am
&gt;     also sorry I didnt make it very far past the second paragraph.
&gt;     Karen obviously does not research before she writes her articles.
&gt;     &quot;However, the precise location of the Sanatorium is a closely
&gt;     guarded secret.&quot;
&gt;     Ummm Karen needs to learn to use Google as well. If she had she
&gt;     would have been able to print out a map to Waverly which includes
&gt;     information such as tracks, businesses, adresses AND golf courses
&gt;     at the corner. It even shows you an overhead view of each building
&gt;     you pass along the way on each street. Hint to Karen click
&gt;     sattelite view after you explore closeups of map view.
&gt;     Im sorry but if you are going to write a well informed article the
&gt;     first step is become well informed. I wont bother reading the rest
&gt;     of her articles because I wont waste my time looking at research
&gt;     from someone who cant bother to cover the basics like look at a
&gt;     map before you drive out to someplace you&#x27;ve never been before and
&gt;     then misinform people that it is in a secret location. Nor do I
&gt;     see walking on a tour as as actual &quot;investigation&quot; .
&gt;     Alot of the people once believed the earth was flat, unfortunately
&gt;     they were not &quot;well informed&quot; and they too were victims of shoddy
&gt;     research. Luckily there are those who do look beyond the horizon
&gt;     and open their minds to the possibility that there is more out there.
&gt;     Happy New Years everyone and may your journey next year be in the
&gt;     right direction!
&gt;     Misty

&gt;         I was lead to believe this person had an interset in the box,
&gt;         and she brought her &quot;boyfirend&quot; that just happen to be local,
&gt;         to our meeting the other day. I let them &quot;barrow&quot; #63, now I&#x27;m
&gt;         sure she will claim she tested the box &quot;scientifically, and
&gt;         can prove it does not work.
&gt;         Karen had contacted me via e-mail requesting a meeting. I
&gt;         thought she was someone off the group and has an interest in
&gt;         EVP and the boxes. She did mention she was a skeptic, but I
&gt;         didn&#x27;t think debunker, or a professional skeptic--wonder who
&gt;         pays these twits?
&gt;         These skeptics don&#x27;t allow themselves to hear anything, yet
&gt;         will proclaim that as proof the boxes and EVP don&#x27;t work, as
&gt;         if their hearing is somehow better than the average persons
&gt;         ear. If a person doesn&#x27;t want to hear it, they won&#x27;t, and
&gt;         because they can&#x27;&#x27;t hear EVP that means no one else an either.
&gt;         Yeah, real scientific!
&gt;         Gonna have to remember Google-googel- google!!
