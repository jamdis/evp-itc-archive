I'm still giving this topic a lot of thought because I absolutely believe i=
n the power of prayer, the power of positivity, and the power of ritual.  W=
hen I first started recording EVP a couple of years ago I was warned to exp=
ect negative responses, so when it happened to me I felt elated rather than=
 frightened or distressed.  I will ask again:  What physical or psychic har=
m is a disembodied entity capable of doing?  Please listen to the one EVP I=
've posted on this board and tell me what, if anything, you hear.  I know w=
hat I hear, and I consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is the resp=
onse that has created the determination in me to continue researching the u=
nknown.  

Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings.  I only want to learn as =
much as I can from you and the other dedicated researchers on this board.  =
It never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in the past, and that's =
about all I can say.  I will probably use one from this point on, maybe not=
 so much to repel evil as to attract goodness.  

So, thank you for this co=
ntribution.  I think the debate has been an excellent one, and I've appreci=
ated the opportunity to be enlightened.

Robin

  Subject: [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debat=
e


  I swore I would not get wraped up in this debate

  BUT!

  The reaso=
n I came up with this whole protection ritual was that some 
  of the new r=
esearchers where

  expressing a rational concern for negative responces th=
at they were 
  recieving through thier boxes.

  The short protection ritu=
al that I posted is not meant to quell 
  irrational histerical fear, and I=
 agree

  with rosemary that anyone suffering from such fear should rethink=
 
  thier involment in the paranormal research field.

  that being said, I=
t was only meant as a source of subliminal comfort 
  to those new individu=
als that had never 

  expperienced spiritual negativity. And to help ease =
them into 
  aproaching a session eventually with confidence

  and determi=
nation as well as full curiousity for all types of the 
  communication we =
recieve.

  My initial post of the ritual file was done with the best of 
 =
 intentions and meant to be another tool available for those who felt 

  t=
hey needed or wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer 
  ritual=
, I don't think it is really worthy of all this debate.

  Use it, don't us=
e it. It's there if you want it. Also I must say 
  there are two kinds of =
fear the kind that is natural and a god 

  given emotion for self preserva=
tion, ie the fright and flight reflex 
  that is an instinctive trait in al=
l of us. Then you have the 

  irrational dibilitating phobic fear that can=
 turn an individual into 
  a frozen statue. That type of fear I believe is=
 unhealthy

  and should be addressed and dealt with and learned how to har=
ness. I 
  also believe that anyone that harbors that type of fear 

  woul=
d not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a case of such 
  fear it wo=
uld already be present and doing a small protection 

  ritual would not fu=
el it any further. So lets take it for what it is, 
  something to utilize =
in our box of tools like an emf meter.

  you may have an old rusty odd siz=
ed wrench at the bottom of your tool 
  box at home that you inherited from=
 your grandfather and have never 
  used

  but if you come across that odd=
 nut that needs tightening somedsy you 
  will be glad you have it.
