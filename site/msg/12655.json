I went into\nRadioshack today and they handed me a coupon for 30% off Radioshack\nproducts and 10% off additional products. I bought the 20-125 for\nabout $30. So that is a nice discount. I almost wanted to by other\nstuff but I decided to wait off on it. The coupons expire on 11/2 so\ntry to get to your local Radioshack. I don&#39;t know if they are giving\naway the coupons everywhere, but I also got an email about the\ndiscounts, so there is a good chance they are. Good luck.\n\n-Aaron"}
