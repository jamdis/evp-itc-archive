<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Sounds good if you can insure the &quot;Secret&#x27; ... Please remember that I&#x27;m a
Magician/Mentalist and I&#x27;ve utilized similar procedures in a Deceptive
manner. But if you can assure no &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; it is a fantastic idea!!!!
I once did something similar with three boxes. Only about 30 or so people
guessed. One fellow hit one directly and said one of the other boxes was
empty .. and it was !!!! (But he guesses the wrong one... Still, with
millions of things it could have been... Very Interesting !!! All on the up
and up.
Keep up the good work.

&gt; I am  hesitant to reveal the answer to anyone before the end of the test,
&gt; since that would call into question a possible &#x27;leak&#x27;.
&gt;
&gt; But I have loaded a mac version of the file up now, which doesn&#x27;t use any
&gt; self-extracting extra applications: just the disk imaging built into the
&gt; OS.  I&#x27;ll look into doing the same with Windows, so there is no worry about
&gt; any apps in the zip file.

&gt; This is AWESOME!!!!
&gt; We did several experiments like this on the Magic Cafe and the results were
&gt; amazing. However, I would request that you contact one member on the board
&gt; and tell them the real answer. If the zip file carries any applications it
&gt; can not be trusted unfortunately.
&gt; I think this can be very exciting and fun too!!!!

&gt;&gt; Experiment 2
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; On Friday, 7/16/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer monitor,
&gt;&gt; right in front of me, and will leave it there until noon Denver time on
&gt;&gt; Monday, 7/19/2010. This experiment asks for participants to determine what
&gt;&gt; that object is. Vague or partial answers won&#x27;t be counted (for example, just
&gt;&gt; giving a color, shape, size, what it&#x27;s made of, etc): we&#x27;re looking for what
&gt;&gt; it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Monday won&#x27;t count. Participants
&gt;&gt; can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means they chose. At
&gt;&gt; the end of the experiment, I will reveal the object, and a tally of the
&gt;&gt; number of correct and/or incorrect answers.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In order to keep me honest, I have taken a picture of the object at the
&gt;&gt; start of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of
&gt;&gt; this group. The idea with this file is that you can download it now and
&gt;&gt; &#x27;keep it safe&#x27; on your computer. Then at the end of the experiment, I will
&gt;&gt; post the password so you can reveal the contents of the file. That way, you
&gt;&gt; were in control of the original image during the entire test, not me. If you
&gt;&gt; can follow the link, it is here:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Windows users: http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/
&gt;&gt; RJ/RJ20100716. win.zip&lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.win.zip&gt;

&gt;&gt; RJ/RJ20100716. mac.zip&lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.mac.zip&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And if you do not care to download the zip file now, I will post the final
&gt;&gt; image there at the end of the experiment anyway.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My monitor is one of the older box-like SONY CRTs, and says &quot;Trinitron&quot;
&gt;&gt; and &quot;Multiscan 200sf&quot; on the upper front. I have a couple monitors stacked
&gt;&gt; in my closet too: they are not the monitors used in this experiment (and
&gt;&gt; have nothing else on them anyway), and I have several laptops around: they
&gt;&gt; are also not the monitors in this experiment. The monitor in this experiment
&gt;&gt; is the only SONY monitor I have, says &quot;SONY in various places on it, can be
&gt;&gt; seen in the following link from the first experiment, when the correct
&gt;&gt; answer would have been &quot;radio&quot;:

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Please post all answers to the group thread: that way, there will be a
&gt;&gt; public record and I won&#x27;t get accused of losing any answers.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And best of luck to all the participants!
