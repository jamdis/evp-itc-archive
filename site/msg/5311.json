I took a shot and brought it home and hacked \nit in a matter of minutes and was willing to take a chance for the sake \nof research.  Well it worked, it is model #20-125.  I took the 3 screws \nout minus the antenna screw and opened it up.  I took away the top \nboard and didn&#39;t see much and seen a lower board below it.  No screws, \nthey are held together by clips on the top and bottom of the board.  \nThe bottom board once removed has markings and you will look for the MU \non the board.  The ribbon looks like a hardrive ribbon for a computer.  \nIt has glue covering the wires that you have to move away, i used a \nstraight razor.  Once the wire is clean and able to be approached, cut \nit with the same straight razor. Just the wire marked MU for Mute. \nClose the unit up and your done. \n\nHope this helps\n\nThanx,\n-Steve H."}
