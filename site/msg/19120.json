As a\nformer live sound engineer, feedback was quite the nemesis.\n\nIf I remember reading right, you have a small microphone and a small speaker\nin your &quot;echo chamber.&quot;  A feedback loop happens when a speaker produces\naudio and a microphone pics that audio up.  The thing is, if the speaker and\nmicrophone are not far enough apart from one another, a feedback loop occurs\nwhere the audio loop between microphone to speaker keeps building up and\nfrequencies start to converge into feedback.\n\nConsidering that your echo chamber is right under the batteries, the\nmicrophone in the echo chamber is probably picking up the audio from the\nmain speaker output at the same time as the output that is in the echo\nchamber.  The two sources picked up at the same time is causing the\nfeedback.   By venting the battery chamber, the soundwaves from the main\nspeaker  are being released easier from the hollow design of the box.  This\nallows for the natural reverberation caused by speaker output to stop\nreverberating around inside the box, it is this bouncing around of audio\nthat is= eventually picked up by your echo chamber microphone at the same\ntime and becomes feedback.\n\nThe same thing happens during a concert when a performer gets his microphone\nto close to the floor monitor.  A feedback loop occurs because the singer\nhear&#39;s his voice in the floor monitor at the same time as it is coming out\nof his mouth.  A loop occurs where the frequencies build upon each other and\nfeedback happens.  In your case, the microphone inside the echo chamber is\nsimply picking up the main speaker at the same time as the speaker in your\necho box, causing the same audio pattern.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nTim\nOn Wed, Oct 27, 2010 at 2:38 AM, Frank Sumption\n&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  [Attachment(s) &lt;#12bec6a7bae7ff88_TopText&gt; from Frank Sumption included\n&gt; below]\n&gt;\n&gt; The battery box is on top of the echo chamber, and venting the door helps\n&gt; cut the feedback for some weird acoustical reason.
