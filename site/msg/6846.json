Maybe we should make a bumper sticker of what you said about ghosts and sent it to A & E.  Would they get the idea?\n   \n  Jeff\n   \n    In a message dated 2/5/2008 4:44:07 P.M.

She says that it is real, but there are some issues on the production end.  Basically any attempts at the technical side of investigation gets cut.  The kids aren&#39;t used to being on camera, so you do see a lot of retakes that seem rehearsed.  She was also not thrilled that they chose to emphasize so much demonic stuff right off the bat.  That was way out of balance.\n\n&gt; I guess according to A & E\n&gt; that if we are talking to the spirit of the dead then WE are the\n&gt; problem and should stop it or atleast that is how they addressed it.\n&gt; Or is just how I see it?  \n\nNo, I was also howling over that.  So talking to dead people is bad, eh?  Maybe I should take their word for it that all dead people are nasty, negative entities, as well.  This kind of thing drives me nuts.
