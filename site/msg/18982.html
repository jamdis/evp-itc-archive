The 069 file I can hear, the understand one, to me--"your fault I'm here",
and the last is that same broken wash machine sound. As far a s new
language--why!? Even the ET's use english.

 BTW, ya don't wanna leave a box on all the time, that's just nutz.

 Try watching the Naked Archeologist on History International, you'll find

Hardly gospel truth as most assume, more of an urban legend than anything.
