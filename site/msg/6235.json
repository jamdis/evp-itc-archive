I heard nearly \nevery word of every file exactly as you did, and it made my hair \nstand on end!!\n\nRobin\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; hey,\n&gt; \n&gt; I did a MB session today and asked for Ms. Estep.\n&gt; Mike and lisa were kind enough to bring her forward and help with \nthe \n&gt; communication. I believe she is still adjusting to being on the \nother \n&gt; side and has not fully grasped how to send communication from the \nother \n&gt; side, with an array of different boxes to work with.\n&gt; \n&gt; I asked about the prior message concerning her whistle statement, \nthe \n&gt; answer I recieved was &quot;they whistled often&quot; I&#39;m assuming she meant \nher \n&gt; spirit contacts.\n&gt; \n&gt; The files are posted in a sub folder marked MB_files in my main \nfolder\n&gt; Bruces box files. In the future all sub folders for different box \nfiles \n&gt; will be in this sub folder.\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks guy&#39;s\n&gt; \n&gt; bruce\n&gt;"}
