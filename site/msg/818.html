<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t know, kinda strange, and suspicious since the site&#x27;s been up since 
2002! It&#x27;s been my expereince if you try to wake too many up, or put out 
what is percieved as good, or light energy, you get these darkside 
reactions. I learned first hand you don&#x27;t try to fill an area with positve 
energy, or try to drive out all the demons, the consequences can be deadly 
as you get a darkside reaction. An Italian researcher thought he would have 
a group focus on a small area in Italy to see if conditions could be 
improved, the result, that giant quake in Afkanistan, I think it was 
directly related. I tried to surround Denver with a &quot;shield&quot; of white light, 
years ago, and a whole family was beaten to death with a hammer that night. 
Ya have to be really careful, cuz innocents die as a result. I wouldn&#x27;t be 
surprised if loss of my son wasn&#x27;t karma.  Maybe I&#x27;m thinking too much......

I&#x27;m not in a huge hurry to get the site back up, I think I need to meditate 
on this for awhile.
