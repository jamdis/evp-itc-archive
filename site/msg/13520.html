<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Chad.  It&#x27;s great to see others giving this method a try.  I&#x27;ve been working with this technique going on three years now.  It takes forever and a day to go through the video one frame at a time, so whenever I share, I always just provide the still captures of the images I find.

Interestingly, two of my ITC images have been verified by a forensic lab as being a match to the photograph of the person taken while they were still in the physical.  Kinda cool.  :-)

I&#x27;d love to take a peek at the images you got once you&#x27;re done going through the video and clipping them out.  I actually saw some while looking at your video (I kept hitting the stop button randomly).  I tried to find your posted still images, but don&#x27;t see them.  LOL, probably &quot;operator error&quot; on my part!

&gt; Its kind of hard to see anything in an uploaded video, Bill. If you have Skype I can send you the original file. That way you can go through it frame by frame as is required for seeing the images. There is still a lot of images I haven&#x27;t pulled as of yet in there. My user name on Skype is:

&gt; The uploaded video is VERY boring.
