&gt; Frank,
&gt; Personally, I agree with the protection, but I do NOT BELIEVE there 
is
&gt; anyone ONLY meant to do what you claim or anyone else that claims
&gt; their the best for communicating with spirit this way! or any other 
way.
&gt; 
&gt; I for one have been doing this stuff for 18 years and I have never
&gt; said allot, but that got my goat, end of story. I know that this 
type
&gt; of communication and use of radios has been going on since 1988 and
&gt; you stepped up to the plate and improved on the original process. 
&gt; But, balanced people are strongly encouraged to always be aware of 
the
&gt; emotional and mental issues that can possibly happen. Now for the UN
&gt; BALANCED? Well, you have all experienced the results. So, lets drop
&gt; the issue and get on with our spirituality and growth and learn 
more,
&gt; and have fun doing it at the same dern time.

&gt; &gt;  Hi All; We have been warned by others from time to time about
&gt; unbridled box use, as it supposedly brings in negativity. I don&#x27;t 
want
&gt; to believe that, but there are a few cases of people using boxes 
made
&gt; by me, as well as the hack radios, and going whacko big time. Its&#x27;
&gt; either all ego--I&#x27;m the onlyest one that can use this, or like the
&gt; more recent example. I don&#x27;t know if these people were like this to
&gt; start, or if it&#x27;s an external influance, but it&#x27;s discouraging. 
There
&gt; seems to be a similar reaction with systems not made by me--so I&#x27;ve
&gt; been told.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  Soooo, maybe burn some white candles, and maybe get a Rosary. My
&gt; guys talk about the Catholics, and the Purple Princess has a 
Catholic
&gt; connection on the etheric levels, although the church imposes too 
many
&gt; limits on her. I wouldn&#x27;t want to go into a state of fear, but a
&gt; little protection stuff couldn&#x27;t hurt. 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  Not only do I not have the time to mass produce boxes, I&#x27;m
&gt; beginning to think it&#x27;s not a good idea anyway.
