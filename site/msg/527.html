Well,
  doesnt really make much sense that the owner of the group leaves, i dont know how other people feel about this but there wont be much of a group left then. Franks the one that keeps the messages going, giving evp's etc. Other than a few misc postings its all Frank. It will be interesting to see how this all plays out. Thanks to everyone for the damage youve caused. You have accomplished exactly what you set out to do. Be mean, evil and trifiling. You get what you give, and ten fold at that. EVP should teach you at the least, that you still lead the same miserable life after you die! HOW SAD!
   
  Frank, plz forward this to that email i sent you, i dont have that address.
  Hopefully, youll just send me an email today telling me you want back on the list!
