So please dont think I am going to spend \nmy few hours freetime playing babysitter here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Quite frankly all involved have been told I do not have time for \nthier online dramafests. They can go fight each other all they wish \nto somewhere else its stupid. I am not thier mother and tho it is \nMother&#39;s day I do not feel any motherly tendancies towards anyone \nand that includes my friends. \n&gt; \n&gt; As for research, while everyone is so wrapped up in the feeding \nfrenzy against one another elsewhere, I still use my freetime to do \nresearch or spend time with those I actually get along with. I would \nsuggest they give it a try. If they enjoy fighting...good for them \nmore power to them and have fun...someplace else. \n&gt; \n&gt; People here seem to think I am the boss. I tell you all now YOU \nare the boss of YOURSELF. You speak for yourself, your own actions \nand everything you say and do will be a representation of who you \nreally are. Have a good look in the mirror to make sure that image \ndoesnt resemble some of the things you hate about others. Positive, \nnegative, good, evil, its up to you just like it is up to all \nspirits to choose how they treat others.\n&gt; \n&gt; I cant choose for you. But I will say I am here to learn more \nabout ITC and do research. What are you guys here for? If its not \none of those things then you simply joined the wrong group. Keep \ngoing you will find the right one they pretty much have one for \neverything these days.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for the BS we have been subjected to enough of it so people \nwho post junk against each other simply will get it deleted and \nposting privledges moderated or removed. Find something better to do \nor someplace better to do it. \n&gt; \n&gt; I do not control you all. Nor do I wish to. And I do not have to \ntake a side in a fight I dont believe in.\n&gt; \n&gt; So my side is, at the end of the day I am tired. The fighting is \ndumb. And I am done wasting another minute discussing it. Those who \npost here should be posting about ITC or do not bother to post. If \nyou feel that you have to fight with each other, fine go fight...I \njust dont want to be forced to read it nor do the members of this \ngroup who are here for the RIGHT reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt; On that note I hope that you all have a great day. For all the \nmoms out there HAPPY MOTHERS DAY!
