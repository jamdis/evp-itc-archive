<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just my opinion (please feel free to take it with a grain of salt), but I&#x27;ve learned that it&#x27;s not my job to convince anyone. Some people are set in their ways and always will be (despite the evidence, a direct experience and other &quot;proofs&quot; pointing to or suggesting the contrary). I realize this will likely always be the case and I don&#x27;t try to change a person&#x27;s mind anymore than I would appreciate them trying to change my mind or convince me of something I don&#x27;t buy into. The best we can do, it seems, is to simply continue our work as usual and those who find value in such things will do so. Those who don&#x27;t (or won&#x27;t) are loved and respected all the same and will hopefully go about their merry way...

...and the beat goes on. 

I&#x27;ve never heard of the box being used to brainwash the masses (a new one every day!) but then again I would have likely never thought intelligent energies, entities and consciousness would communicate with us through a radio.  ;)

Congrats on your first hack and what sounds like an incredible first experience! I&#x27;m new here, but welcome to the board.
