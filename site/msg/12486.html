&gt; Ok bear with me(Im a gamer too)...I once found an old atari system
with like 20 games at a thrift store and remembered back when I was a
kid and thought ohhhh yaaaa this was the GREATEST gaming system
EVER!!! So I snagged it for a whopping 50 bucks...took that bad boy
home jimmy rigged it to my new tv system, prepared myself for the
awesome graphics of Donkey Kong and Pac-Man....turned it on and went
WTF!!!!? WHERES THE AWESOMENESS I REMEMBER, THE COOL GRAPHICS!?!?!?! 
&gt; 

To each their own, there&#x27;s a lot of people who still love playing that
system and other game systems from the era.

&gt; I think it would be like that...ya it&#x27;d cool to try it out and
relive its glory days for about a weekbut I&#x27;d want my RS Hack back
lol. But it would definately be cool to try and if you can afford it
and have the paitence to try that method...go for it! I&#x27;d love to
hear the results. =)
&gt; 

I do both with investigations and such, bring along analog and digital
recorders (and being a musician I still work with both technologies as
well).  There&#x27;s certain tonal and depth qualities that get sampled out
in digital as well as different types of artifacting that digital
produces, just as there&#x27;s certain clarities not capable in analog with
out a lot of extra work besides the ease of use of the medium.

&gt; Hi Judy. I think if that type of research interests you and you can
afford the $160 (and 
&gt; anything else you might need to go along with it for EVP purposes),
why not? For myself, I 
&gt; just find it to be too time consuming and frustrating to go through
so much recorded 
&gt; material for so little in return, content wise, when we already have
the ability (albeit in it&#x27;s 
&gt; infancy) to engage in real-time, or nearly real-time, two-way
conversations.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, Sarah got amazing results and bless her pioneering spirit which
helped bring us to 
&gt; where we are today. I&#x27;m not sure how much of her success was her
equipment and how 
&gt; much was her energy (I think we are all a component in our
sessions). In regard to 
&gt; traditional EVP work, given how good many of today&#x27;s inexpensive
digital recorders are, 
&gt; that is the route I&#x27;ve gone for situations where sweep isn&#x27;t an
option. I&#x27;ve gotten good EVP 
&gt; with my Panasonic RR-US360, the Sony B26, and a handful of others. I
know some are 
&gt; still successfully using cassettes. 
&gt; 
&gt; I guess it all boils down to a matter of preference and the type of
EVP research that most 
&gt; interests you. As my dear hubby says, &quot;Whatever floats your boat!&quot; ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; If you do decide to try Sarah&#x27;s method, let us know how you do.

&gt; &gt; Hi All, Been awhile since I&#x27;ve posted here, but was wondering
about the 
&gt; &gt; methods Sarah used with her reel to reel tape recorder (Technics or 
&gt; &gt; Teac model - anyone know which???) as it seems she got MANY Spirit 
&gt; &gt; voices or EVP&#x27;s this way. Not to knock, Frank&#x27;s Boxes or other Ghost 
&gt; &gt; Boxes! Just a though! I may have an opportunity to get a $160. 
&gt; &gt; refurbised Teac or Technics reel to reel tape recorder, but am 
&gt; &gt; wondering IF I should get it or not (it&#x27;s a 1970&#x27;s model
appearently) ! 
&gt; &gt; Comments/ideas? Thanks! =Judy= 8-D
