Your talking about the "Mosquito" in the UK. It is based on frequencies tha=
t younger ears are still snesitive to but older ears have lost. The concept=
 really isn't mysterious, hearing is like vision it it can become fuzzy and=
 the range smaller as you get older.

Anyway, the mosquito emits a high pit=
ched whine that hurts people below the age of about 19 or 20.
