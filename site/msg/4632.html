<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ann,

I also thought that the subdued lighting or maybe camera movement was
causing the images to distort but on that SciFi show I mentioned in an
earlier post, they brought their own Polaroids and their own film and
got the same double image when the Luminator was turned on. I&#x27;m not
saying the images are the dead relatives of the person in the photo,
but something odd is happening. -Bill

&gt; No, you&#x27;re not a downer; we all must maintain healthy skeptical minds 
&gt; in this field.  Like I said, from what I&#x27;ve seen of the Luminator&#x27;s 
&gt; products, the jury&#x27;s still out on this.

&gt; &gt; Not to be a downer, but I have never seen a photo taken by the  
&gt; &gt; Luminator that did not appear to me to be more than a long or  
&gt; &gt; otherwise distorted exposure (I&#x27;m very unclear of the effects  
&gt; &gt; whatever it is the device supposedly does to a camera mechanism). 
&gt; I  
&gt; &gt; wish that wasn&#x27;t the case, but until I see one of these images 
&gt; that  
&gt; &gt; convinces me otherwise, I have to be honest about it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Deb,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry to hear you were ill at The Stanley conference. I, too, was 
&gt; at
&gt; &gt; &gt; The Stanley when Mark Macy spoke there; afterwards he took 
&gt; polaroid
&gt; &gt; &gt; photos of us with the luminator. The photos were interesting; some
&gt; &gt; &gt; of them looked like mere double exposures, others did show what 
&gt; could
&gt; &gt; &gt; be the superimposition of another face from another dimension. I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; &gt; new to visual ITC, so the jury&#x27;s out on this one for now!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wow, I&#x27;m loving all this information, it&#x27;s giving me a lot of
&gt; &gt; &gt; ideas.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Very exciting for me!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does Mark Macy belong to this forum too? I met him about 3 years
&gt; &gt; &gt; ago.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My husband is a commercial photographer and Mark asked him to do
&gt; &gt; &gt; his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; portrait for a book he was coming out with. He came to our home
&gt; &gt; &gt; studio
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the portrait, and I got to talk with him a little about what
&gt; &gt; &gt; he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does. At that time all I knew of EVP was from the White Noise
&gt; &gt; &gt; movie,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#x27;t sure it was real. But Mark was very nice, passionate 
&gt; about
&gt; &gt; &gt; ITC/
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EVP and very convincing. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect 
&gt; when I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; originally heard what he did, with all the loonies out there
&gt; &gt; &gt; claiming
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all kinds of stuff, but I got a really good feeling from him and
&gt; &gt; &gt; he&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very, well, like I said, convincing. After that I went to his 
&gt; web
&gt; &gt; &gt; site
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and also bought one of his books, which was a nice read.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I went to the Stanley Hotel in November with a ghost hunting 
&gt; group
&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mark was a speaker there. I was really looking forward to his
&gt; &gt; &gt; lecture,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but ended up with a wicked stomach virus and had to come home
&gt; &gt; &gt; early. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; missed just about everything that weekend!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oops. I forgot to answer: No, I have not given up ghost 
&gt; hunting
&gt; &gt; &gt; at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all, but over the years I have come to focus more on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; collection
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and distribution of experiences than on encountering phenomena
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself. ITC has really affirmed this for me.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve felt all along that my job is to make people aware that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual phenomena go on all the time in millions of lives; 
&gt; I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a scientist and I know nothing I do will change the way 
&gt; science
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinks. BUT if I can open the minds of young people today,
&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our future scientists will make it their business to figure 
&gt; all
&gt; &gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know this is a lot of what ITC experimenters are doing:
&gt; &gt; &gt; convincing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others of the afterlife by their recorded evidence. Amazing
&gt; &gt; &gt; things
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can happen when THAT happens.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, Mark Macy is so wonderful because he has dedicated his
&gt; &gt; &gt; life
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to this. He and his colleagues have received such detailed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; descriptions of how the afterlife works, that they have helped
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; living change their lives to erase the fear of death--and to 
&gt; live
&gt; &gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a way that brings us to as high a spiritual level as possible
&gt; &gt; &gt; right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away when our bodies die. This means, for example, dealing 
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issues and addictions, that plague us in life, since the 
&gt; spirits
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tell us we take it all with us! That is, death isn&#x27;t a cure-
&gt; all.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any glimpse at the history of ITC shows us that all of this 
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; &gt; been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gradually growing since the 19th century, when state-of-the-
&gt; art
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; graphite pencils and telegraphs were used to contact the dead.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since then, there have been &quot;breakthroughs&quot; a number of times
&gt; &gt; &gt; when
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; astounding floods of messages have come through.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You experimenters are all so incredible--I&#x27;m amazed every day 
&gt; at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your love, dedication and faith. Surely something wonderful is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to come from all this, and I think it&#x27;s going to come
&gt; &gt; &gt; during
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our lifetimes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Robin,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your phrase of &quot;ritualized vs. random&quot; is interesting. There
&gt; &gt; &gt; are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who believe that communication is between the conscious of 
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; researcher and the entity and the equipment is secondary. 
&gt; It&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get swept up in the technology and forget there is possibly 
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; psychic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connection going on. With that said, focusing on equipment
&gt; &gt; &gt; actually
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can help the researcher become receptive to establishing a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication link. While paying attention to the equipment,
&gt; &gt; &gt; we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forget
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about the daily distractions and minor irritations that may
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prevent us
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from establishing contact.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The setting up the gear we use could be considered the first
&gt; &gt; &gt; part of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;ritual&quot;. I like to clear my mind, set up equipment, 
&gt; mess
&gt; &gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some more, then I am mentally prepare to begin what I hope 
&gt; will
&gt; &gt; &gt; be a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; successful session.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess &quot;random&quot; recording to me would be what happens in 
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; field
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; during a paranormal investigation. I don&#x27;t bring Box
&gt; &gt; &gt; technology
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; location with the intention of possibly contacting lingering
&gt; &gt; &gt; spirits
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at that location but I do bring audio recorders in hopes of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recording
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evp&#x27;s.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I find the Box works perhaps even better when I&#x27;m in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; familiar
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; place
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like the room in my home that is designated for that 
&gt; purpose. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire to have the finest Box technology that is possible 
&gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important is the association that seems to occur between the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; researcher and the Box that is favored. Despite some of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; benefits
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the new gear, the one that I seem to have a connection 
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that requires a little more finesse to operate. -Bill

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need that much recording time, but I sure have liked the

&gt; &gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wouldn&#x27;t mind upgrading a bit.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Frank! I basically follow your suggestion when

&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I learned to be quiet I actually started getting

&gt; &gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the entities at my house got tired of playing with me
&gt; &gt; &gt; though,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they aren&#x27;t saying anything. I kind of miss them, but I do

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Radio Shack now carries the Olympus VN-4100PC at about

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; price I

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 960. The 4100 has about 4 times the recording time, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; think.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would

&gt; &gt; &gt; I

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beyond

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; captured around my own home, particularly outside on 
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hill and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near the barn. I&#x27;ve gotten two inside my house (after
&gt; &gt; &gt; inviting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been 
&gt; negative
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messages.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#x27;m thinking about getting another DVR and 
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your thoughts and recommendations about which ones are
&gt; &gt; &gt; best. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like to communicate with more advanced entities
&gt; &gt; &gt; eventually,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunately don&#x27;t have the brain for building 
&gt; anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!
