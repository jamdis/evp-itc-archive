Aaron,
 
You could get a larger speaker for the old 469 it will give you h=
igher volume
and I don't know if your aware that the speaker or headphones =
act as the antenna
for the radio.
 
I personally won't use the new 469 beca=
use of the clicking on AM and I don't
ever use FM on any of my boxes for th=
e reason that FM is cosiderablly more
cluttered with noise than AM and it i=
s harder to hear or discern real time communication.

Hey =
Bruce, Thanks for offering to help. I've been on the list for a couple of w=
eeks, but just started to get involved. I've gone over many files on the li=
st and listen to the new ones that are posted, so I can get accustomed to w=
hat I am trying to listen for. I've done paranormal research in the past (I=
 have all kinds of equipment, emf detectors, cameras, infrared thermometers=
, dowsing rods, etc, and am looking to expand even further), and have gotte=
n a few traditional EVPs that I will post in my folder later. I am actually=
 in Lutz, Florida. Its just slightly north of Tampa, Florida (right on the =
city limits. If anyone wants to meet up, let me know, I'm up for it), so my=
 reception isn't too bad. I was using the radio next to a computer, a tv, a=
nd a few other EMF emitting devices. I never considered the interference fr=
om those when doing my session. In addition to the newer 12-469 model, I fo=
und the older model and played with it for a lil bit, but it doesn't compar=
e to the newer one. The volume is lower and the reception on that one is mu=
ch worse. Is there anyway I can improve volume and/or the signal on the old=
er one to make it work better? I know at Radioshack they have a few things =
to boost volume. I used to work at RadioShack, and it kills me everytime I =
buy something from there and can't get my old 30% employee discount. Lol. O=
nce again, thanks for the help.-Aaron
