I know that there are many spirits who are vulga=

 mood was a little down, maybe negative.... also I'm a relatively young fem=
ale (28). I'm wondering if its due to those two factors that I received - u=

 if I've crossed the line as far as posting up vulgar words on this group -=
 not sure how else
 to discuss my session, lol... and I do apologize)

So h=

 does that only egg them on further? Help!
