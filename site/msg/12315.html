My team has not yet purchased the Ovilus but I have been told that it has t=
he ability to form words that have not been programmed into it.=A0 Since I =
have never used one, I am wondering what are the similarities between the O=
vilus and Frank's Box.=A0 Could it be at all possible that rather than just=
 forming words or sounds based on atmospheric readings, spirits are speakin=
g through the Ovilus as they do Frank's box?=A0 
=A0
I don't mean to sound =
silly or presumptous, but I am very very curious!!=A0 I am looking forward =
to purchasing the Ovilus as well as the puck in the near future!=A0 Thanks =
for any feedback onthe Ovilus!
