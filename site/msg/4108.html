ITC researchers across the world usually get messages aimed towards thier comprehension. Those who speak other languages get messages mostly in thier language the same as I do. However they DO sometimes use terms or phrases or "gibberish" that are phrases in other languages. I speak a little french and occasionally recognize words from other languages (spanish, chinese, german etcetera...but I find phonetics is the way to go and anything I dont understand enough to phonetically spell it out or disrupts a long fluid sentence...gets xx'd out.
   
  I watched a video online the other day of Sonia Rinaldi on a show. They were playing some of her evp clips for the audience. I do not speak her language but what was said was clear as day and phonetically it was exactly what I heard. "They" were very clear in thier statements she recorded.
   
  "They" got a bit excited when I started to teach english to exchange student employees. I started to get some strange things in evp. "They" told me happy birthday in cantonese which was similar to a chinese phrase for it that one of the students later told me. I looked it up online when I got home and there underneath it was the similar yet different phrase in cantonese. (The chinese language system is interesting, there are so many different dialects.) None of the students were cantonese or spoke that language. If I hadnt just gotten the evp and spelled it out phonetically I never would have noticed it at all. If the students language hadnt had a couple words that were similar to the other language so that when she said it, it rang a bell.. never would have noticed. 
   
  It was all a "coincidence" sort of happening. Or was it.
   
  To make matters more interesting there happened to be a cantonese woman passing thru at work (coincidence again?) and when I asked her to say Happy Birthday in her language so I could hear the proper pronunciation, it matched the evp I had gotten previously (coincidence yet again?). It matches my phonetic spelling completely and was pretty much as I heard hear it tho from a different voice of course.
   
  I dont speak chinese and I dont speak cantonese and it was getting a bit too big for my brain so I asked them to try and stick to english so I can focus more on whats being said rather than having my mind blown away.
   
  So now on occasion they throw in a parlez vous francais or something in spanish which I can easily get translated by someone I know LOL.
   
  I think they just did it as part of the lesson to show me the scope is a bit wider yet more connected than my brain can handle sometimes.
   
  The more you learn the more there is to share, and thats on both sides. Certain things I can comprehend but when they converse in unrecognizable dialogue or get too technical for me to understand then its a bit too overwhelming for my ears to hear or for my brain to process.
   
  I get alot of bad english, slang, and words that simply arent in the "english" dictionary LOL
   
  yet anyways
   
  I like things I can understand. If nobody else can hear it than so be it, I rather have something be clear for me to understand than sit and wonder what the heck was that all about hehehe
   
  We have quite a few people here who speak other languages. Lets get thier input. I think if they reply you will find most of them get bits of languages they understand/recognize because when recording you are indeed part of the "scenario" and our brains process information differently as well as our hearing and equipment setups differ. So as much as you are tuning into "them".. "they" are tuning into you. 
   
  Some of those bits and peices you get that you think are mumbo jumbo may be someone giving a shoutout in another language... or it may just be mumbo jumbo LOL
   
  Who are "they"? Well that depends on what your viewpoint of "them" is now doesnt it? For me it consists of many whos presence I acknowledge. Friends, family, guides, strangers, the occasional "dead famous" mention which I connect to as much as the strangers. Didnt know them so it is a bit hard to feel connected with lack of recognition. Then there are the nonhuman. 
   
  When asking for names, often an entity has never had a name and others will give them a "title". A word or name them on the spot. Every language is just a means to connect and comprehend each other better. When you have no need for language.. that is when the true connection has been made.
