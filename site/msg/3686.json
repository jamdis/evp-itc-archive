That&#39;s only human after all. \nMisunderstandings and consequential war of words happen, when we \nchoose to feed into it. \n\nI&#39;m just SUPER excited to actually have a MiniBox on order. It&#39;ll be \nmy pleasure to share my own findings for peer review as they present \nthemselves. \n\nCiao,\nLance\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; this is for the entire group. After reading Steve&#39;s post it dawned \non \n&gt; me that he is 1000% right in saying that this has gotten out of \nhand.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do not personally know Chris moon and any slurs I have made upon \n&gt; his character I apologize. I do not agree with the statements he \nmade \n&gt; about box research and the people that are doing it, even though I \n&gt; may not agree with what he Say&#39;s but I have shed my blood for his \n&gt; right to say it.\n&gt; \n&gt; to babierz and lance, forgive my fowl language and the name calling \n&gt; sometimes my temper runs way ahead of my brain. \n&gt; \n&gt; in closing let me say it is the Christmas season and I for one will \n&gt; try to adhere to the old saying &quot;good will toward men&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; lets continue our research with no animosity.\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks\n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;"}
