Bill, nice talking to you again!  I just thought that since we are all spread out all over, it just might be something to try.  I know your in CA, but I am not sure where everyone else except Frank.  
   
  I only have the hacked box so If we set up different boxes at different times, we would have to see who has what and when everyone is available.  
   
  I would be more than happy to help with this exercise.  Do you think it would matter if all our communication is different?
   
  I would be excited to see all of the Frank's Box users do a test and well as a combination of boxes.  I think it would make for some exciting EVP and confirmation that the other planes just may communication regardless of time, space and location.

guess could be considered my counter part. _Bill

testing sessions I am coming to find out that they certainly know all

up. Therefore, I wonder if you all have so called "personal 
assistants" or "tecs" assiged to you or if they are random?
