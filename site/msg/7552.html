<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Michelle, if you approach it without fear, with an honest desire to  
receive communication, and the willingness to slog it out to get that  
communication, then I think the answer is very much a yes.

&gt; Hello All!
&gt; I just recently discovered this group through the Ufogeek&#x27;s website.
&gt; I have been experiencing shadows, electrical sensations that feel like
&gt; someone else is with me. With that being said, I ask if this
&gt; technology you all talk about on this group would help me speak with
&gt; those presences I feel with me? I do not claim a label such as medium,
&gt; psychic or any other title as I think labels are limiting. I am just
&gt; sensitive.
&gt; It is a sense that has run in my family for generations and somewhere
&gt; along the line we started calling it radar.
&gt; I have had experienced a situation with a very close friend that a
&gt; shadow literally popped in on us at the exact time her father passed
&gt; away. She was unable to see it and I was. It literally scared the @#$
&gt; out of me. I have been trying to figure out why he came to us and why
&gt; I was the only one to see this. I was hoping this technology would
&gt; help me understand the presences that come to me. I have no intentions
&gt; of using this for monetary gain or for other people, I just want to
&gt; understand the presences that come to me. Seems the older I get the
&gt; more prevalent they are.
&gt; Let me know your thoughts.
&gt; Michelle
