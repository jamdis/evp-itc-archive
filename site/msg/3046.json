I=\r\nt is tuning across radio, and is using radio stations as the raw audio sour=\r\nce. The first word is &#39;sphinx&#39; from the clip. I have had that image on my s=\r\nhower window all week(Sphinx or Hotep)! The next phrase is &#39;Doris doesn&#39;t l=\r\nike your boobs&#39; (really, I don&#39;t have em&#39;) . I&#39;d say the thing works, and i=\r\nt sounds good. If I had the money I would buy one. As far as for what I hea=\r\nrd, it&#39;s been my expereince that it changes for the listener, so no doubt s=\r\nomeone else will hear something entirely different. The point is, meaningfu=\r\nl messages are formed out the raw audio, as this technology is intended to =\r\nfunction. I would expect it to do like my version, work different for every=\r\n user.   Had I read more on the site I would have found that they didn&#39;t ca=\r\nll it a Frank&#39;s Box, and Mini Box seems an apropriate name. It has always b=\r\neen my intention to spread this idea and information so others could experi=\r\nment and come up with their own version. If it means anything, I would reco=\r\nmmend this product. A little pricy? Maybe, but if others start making this =\r\nstuff that price should come down, it works like that for everything. How m=\r\nany went out and bought $5000 PCs 25 years ago?   I still say you&#39;re allowe=\r\nd to make money cuzz that makes the products available!
