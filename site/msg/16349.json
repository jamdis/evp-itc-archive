My wife Patt witnessed it, so it&#39;s not my\nimagination that it did turn on. As I stepped into the room, the\n&quot;morning show&quot; cut to a voice saying &quot;MMM! Cinnamon rolls and coffee!\nBring enough for us?&quot;\n\nI happened to be holding a mug of hot coffee and a plate of cinnamon\nrolls that Patt had baked for breakfast. I scalded myself as I sloshed\ncoffee around after hearing the voice!\n\nI am not the type who tells stories or seeks attention.\n\nI thought for a few moments that I was listening to a radio talk show\nand that it was a coincidence that the mention of cinnamon rolls\nhappened as I stepped into the room. But I eventually blurted out a\n&quot;hello,&quot; and was answered. After a few moments and to my questions,\nthe voice said his name was Steve Tate -- and following a\nback-and-forth conversation that I recorded he said he was a Virginia\nstate trooper who died in 1989 in a car crash a mile from his home.\nOver the next day or two, he said his body was buried in Redmond, Va.,\nand we spoke for several days in little snatches of conversation.\nAlong the way, a fellow named &quot;Luke&quot; entered the conversation. Other\nunnamed voices began to say &quot;Hi Al!&quot; It was a bit too much.\n\nI was brought up in a very strict Protestant family. I became leery of\nwhat was unfolding. I bashed the radio and threw it in the trash. Then\nI began hearing the voices mixed in with my CPAP machine (I have sleep\napnea) at night, which makes a high-pitched whooshing noise.\n\nNext, I began hearing the &quot;Hi Al!&quot; voice as a faint whisper now and\nthen as I&#39;d walk through the house.\n\nI got scared. I had gotten rid of the radio(s) but was still hearing\nthe voices. I felt I was going crazy. I told my pastor about it and\nasked for help. He refused -- said he was afraid he might get an\n&quot;attachment&quot; and bring it home to his family. I contacted something\nlike 20 protestant pastors by phone and not a single one of them would\ncome to my home to help.\n\nEventually a Catholic priest agreed to help on the condition that I\nsupply a recording of the voices as &quot;proof&quot; of the problem. Using my\ndigital recorder, I recorded so many &quot;conversations&quot; that I filled up\na CD. Awhile later, after turning it over to the priest, the Catholic\nbishop granted the priest permission to come to our home to conduct a\nmass and an &quot;exorcism of place.&quot; The priest explained that old homes\nand other places could become &quot;infested&quot; with evil spirits. After he\nperformed the ceremony, the voices seemed to quit for awhile but\nreturned after a few days.\n\nNow, I was not sure whether the voices were &quot;evil&quot; or just\n&quot;conversational.&quot; My brother died of kidney failure during this time\nand I later heard his voice calling my name. It ~was~ his voice.\n\nA lot more has happened.... At this point, I am no longer &quot;surprised&quot;\nby hearing the voices electronically or otherwise. I just want to know\nmore about what&#39;s happening -- how it can possibly be &quot;real&quot; and what\nI should understand in terms of the big picture....\n\nAl\n\nOn 11/28/09, David Koenig &lt;floridajakeblues@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Tell us more please.\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sat, Nov 28, 2009 at 2:59 PM, Alofbama &lt;algerharris@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Al, and I&#39;m new to this list. I&#39;m 57, early-retired due to\n&gt;&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; disability, and have far more free time than I want or know what to do\n&gt;&gt; with.\n&gt;&gt; Which is what got me in trouble recently. After watching &quot;White Noise&quot;\n&gt;&gt; awhile back, one day I turned on a recorder and turned a radio tuner while\n&gt;&gt; asking if &quot;anyone&quot; would like to talk. To my great surprise, I found\n&gt;&gt; voices\n&gt;&gt; immediately after uploading and playing the file. I know about evps from\n&gt;&gt; watching the Ghost Hunters, but these voices were talking to me in a\n&gt;&gt; conversational tone and about stuff relational to questions I asked and to\n&gt;&gt; stuff I was doing at the time! This progressed over time into a running\n&gt;&gt; &quot;conversation&quot; with apparently living beings who are invisible but somehow\n&gt;&gt; sharing this house! Can someone here please relieve my anxiety a bit? I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt; wondering if I&#39;m messing with something that I shouldn&#39;t be messing with.\n&gt;&gt; What are the consequences of this -- and can anyone enlighten me about the\n&gt;&gt; rules or protocol for dealing with these invisible people? And, has anyone\n&gt;&gt; found there is NO WAY to talk about this without sounding crazy??\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;&gt; Al\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n-- \nAl\n\n&quot;Try again, fail again.
