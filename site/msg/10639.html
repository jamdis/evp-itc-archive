Radio skip is when a broadcast (or CB chatter) is reflected off of the 
atmosphere and picked up far away.  So, skip would be you, Margaret, 
picking up a another city&#x27;s radio broadcast from let&#x27;s say 400 miles 
away, for example. 

However, the theory of &quot;skip&quot; does not answer the specific messages we 
receive that line-up with questions, the experimenter, place, etc.  
Again relevancy is so important to me in deciding if a message is radio 
frag, skip or communication.  I might note that radio skip fluctuates 
dpeneding on atmospheric conditions, I think, so how do we receive 
messages when skip is not prominent?  

Those are some of my thoughts...hope it helps.  :)
