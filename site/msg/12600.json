I really feel like someone in spirit whispered the suggestion in my ear to try \nthis method.  So glad I was paying attention.  And I&#39;m glad I was able to overcome my \ntechnical challenges ... having never transferred video to a computer before, nor worked \nwith any video software, it was a bit of an uphill battle for me in the beginning.  LOL - it \ntook me hours, not kidding, to figure out how to make and convert the video for YouTube.  \nThank goodness old dogs actually can learn new tricks.  ;-)\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, black bear hollow &lt;blackbearhollow@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Your stuff is awesome Margaret.

One of my images was even confirmed by a forensic lab as  \n&gt; &gt; being that of my GG-\n&gt; &gt; grandfather.
