I just had a death in my Family, and \nI \n&gt; was wandering if anybody does a session today/or tonight if you \ncould \n&gt; try to get in contact with a Mr. Charlie Clarke,(my Great Uncle) or \n&gt; Mrs. Joann Clarke(his wife has past a couple of months ago)to see \nif \n&gt; you can contact them.  If you do contact him can you tell him that \n&gt; Rees will be asking to speak with them tonight around 7-8pm eastern \n&gt; time.  To see if they can contact me.  They lived a long and \n&gt; wonderful life together.  So all my family is sad to see him go, \nbut \n&gt; we know it was his time to leave, and life goes on.  He should be \n&gt; happy to be back with his wife.  (He was 83 years old)  I know \n&gt; probaly somebody here might think this is crazy, dumb or \n&gt; disrespectful, but that is my business. I think it should be easy \nto \n&gt; get in contact with him since he just crossed over.  Please let me \n&gt; know if you tried and any evidence you might get from him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; William Rees\n&gt;"}
