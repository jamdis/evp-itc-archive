Well, I have some info from the peanut gallery, most =
is high  pitched so 
many of you guys won't understand it, signing type ang=
el  files, I didn't want 
to believe how a mother could kill her own child,=
  but it seems she did the 
deed.  Seems from what the angels say,  the gra=
ndma and mom Casey got into 
a fight, Casey was mad so when the  parents we=
re gone, she put the baby into 
the truck, and closed the  lid, she may hav=
e been tied so she couldn't get 
out and or  druged.  In one of the files, =
you can hear Caylee crying for her 
 mama, she stills asks for her mother, =
and the angels are saying, that  
"Christ holds the baby"  I have lots of f=
iles now, there are but  a few.  I 
think the spirit say, her mother will "=
get  life." sf
