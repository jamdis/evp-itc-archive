(Necromancy) + even in the Bible it is stated as forbiden! That's for all t=
hose Religious folk's out there. I'm a Spiritual, non-religious, person who=
 believes in EVP's! I have never even gotten negative "doorways opened" or =
"Portals" with negative entities by using a cassette recorder or even a OUI=
JA Board, for that matter. IF people want to believe in demons, negative en=
tities entering thru Portals or doorways . . . . I'd say those people need =
to seek Mental Heath professionals - for help, Not Chris Moon! Here, it's o=
bvious to me, that he (Very Arrogantly) is again promoting himself (as the =
ONLY one) who knows how to genuinely work (or interpret as a Medium does) F=
rank's Box, which HE has renamed, The Telephone to the Dead, and puts down =
all other devices as replicas that are invalid and a waste of money! Just r=
ead, in between the lines (I've marked above) and see what he's really sayi=

 Church, BTW, does NOT allow or believe in communications with the Dead (Ne=
cromancy) + even in the Bible it is stated as forbiden! That's for all thos=
e Religious folk's out there. I'm a Spiritual, non-religious, person who be=
lieves in EVP's! I have never even gotten negative "doorways opened" or "Po=
rtals" with negative entities by using a cassette recorder or even a OUIJA =
Board, for that matter. IF people want to believe in demons, negative entit=
ies entering thru Portals or doorways . . . . I'd say those people need to =
seek Mental Heath professionals - for help, Not Chris Moon! Here, it's obvi=
ous to me, that he (Very Arrogantly) is again promoting himself (as the ONL=
Y one) who knows how to genuinely work (or interpret as a Medium does) Fran=
k's Box, which HE has renamed, The Telephone to the Dead, and puts down all=
 other devices as replicas that are invalid and a waste of money! Just read=
, in between the lines (I've marked above) and see what he's really saying!=
! Think about this! I still feel Frank IS the "primary tester" of HIS boxes=
