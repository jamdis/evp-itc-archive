Left me very  \nunhappy, (p...is..ed o..f). , I sure wish people could make this work for all \nof  us though, and give credit where credit is due, Edison told me, he was \nworking  with a certain couple of people, poor guy, he&#39;s running all over \nthe place, when  people keep asking for his help, he has to stop what he&#39;s \ndoing to inspire one  person, then has to run over to see what all the \nhollering is all about with  someone else.

In fact, I wonder  about that project you are \ngoing to be doing with Mr Moon.  It&#39;s  my guess he is the one who suggested it \n(maybe even dropped some  profitability hints?).  Realize, his method of \nperforming medium  with the box, and charging the vulnerable large amounts of \nmoney, is  under attack from many quarters, and he has begun to go on the  \ndefensive.  One thing that is hard for him to defend, is how he  can be so \nexpert with the box when he had nothing to do with its  construction.\n\nNow consider, if he can get the box&#39;s maker to  participate in a project \ntogether, even just once, he can add to his  list of credentials things such \nas &quot;Worked together with the original  box&#39;s designer, Frank Sumption, on new \ndesigns.&quot; Or even &quot;Co-creater  of the new Box&quot;, whatever it is.\n\nYou will be giving him that  very credibility, that those &quot;do my shows&quot; are \nlooking for.   Maybe even getting him new customers.  Just by associating \nwith  him on one project.\n\nMy advice is, be careful that you aren&#39;t  just being used for your \ncredentials Frank.\n\n\n\n--- On  Sun, 5/24/09, Frank Sumption &lt;_purplealiengirl@purpleali_ \n(mailto:purplealiengirl@...) &gt;  wrote:\n\n\nFrom:  Frank Sumption &lt;_purplealiengirl@purpleali_ \n(mailto:purplealiengirl@...) &gt;\nSubject: Re:  [EVP-ITC] Board talk\nTo: _EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) \nDate: Sunday, May  24, 2009, 4:56 PM  \n\n\n\n \nYeah, real interesting, if ya know something about these  various &quot;players&quot; \nin the field.
