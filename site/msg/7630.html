Dont know if this would be possible or not...but Im an avid CBer and use a 400 watt kicker that goes into my CB and the antenna plugs into the kicker,,,,never opened one up but it may be possible to rig it for ur box?   They sell em at big truck stops and even on ebay...they arent "legal" cuz it also boosts ur outgoing CB signal and the powers that be dont like ya transmitting over like 4 watts I think it is.  Anyways just thought Id toss that thought out there for ya.  I know when I use it with my 102 inch steel whip I get some great skip from all over the country....hmmm wonder if its possible to do a continuous scan thru the CB channels including sideband during peak skip time and use that in a box 
  hmmm...sorry rambling now. =)

But I suppose in my Land-of-Weak-Signals I would get nothing. On the 
other hand, I almost feel I would sacrafice a volume of sessions and 
signals for good, clear, multi-word messages. I am getting EVP block 
because I am afraid I will get nothing during a session or, worse 
yet, I may be getting messages but I cannot hear or understand 
them...if you get my drift. Good stuff at your end. Ron L
