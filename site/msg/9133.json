Let me know what you \nthink and please any addtional information or editing on the ad is \nwelcome. I will also put it on craiglist or anywhere else that will \nbe helpful ...\n\nKay\n\n\n\nMAKE YOUR OWN GHOST BOX\n\nYou can make your own Ghost box that functions similar to a Frank&#39;s \nbox, Joe&#39;s box and the Mini box. All you need to do is go to your \nlocal Radio Shack and pick up the 12-469  Digital AM/FM Pocket Radio \nfor ONLY $24.99 plus tax and with a simple modification. You will \nhave your very own cheap alternative to a &quot;GHOST BOX&quot;.\n\n(I will insert a picture of the RS 12-469 here)\n\n \nThis simple modification lets the radio sweep both the AM and FM \nband. Instead of it scanning and stopping on a station, doing the \nmodification (clipping the &quot;Mute&quot; pin) lets it just sweep the entire \nband, without stopping on any station. Just hook your Radio up to \nsome speakers or headphones and while the radio is sweeping the \nbands start asking questions and get answers in real time.  You can \nalso record it and review it later for answers you may have missed.\n\nThere are several sites for the FREE instructions on how to modify \nyour Radio Shack 12-469.\n\nhttp://ufogeek.com/?p=81\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozhaY1fW3s4 part 1\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2ZLABu0rK0 part 2\n\nFor more information from the &quot;Experts&quot; on Ghost Boxes and EVPS you \ncan also go to:\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/\n\nGood luck and happy ghost hunting!!!!!!!!!!"}
