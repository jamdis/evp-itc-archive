yes, i was searching around to see if anyone else was finding the same thing as me and found that site which is exactly it.  at high enough frequency difference between regen and superregen is usually a matter of moving some wire a fraction of an inch.when its pure regen, short across input will kill it. the squegging is usually frequency modulated so amounts to an unstable linear sweep.  when squegging, short across input wont cut it off.
   
  it can be adjusted so that removal of base bias will not cut it off with antenna.  istart out using about 6 ft of wire as antenna to start out then remove it and all other long wires after i get it tuned up.
   
  you dont have to operate it with base-collector essentially shorted.  thats just one mode
