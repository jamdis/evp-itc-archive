There was some sort of disconnect and my \nname didn&#39;t show up on the guest list, so they couldn&#39;t give me a \nroom there. That&#39;s what the hotel supervisor said last night \nanyway... and it&#39;s too late in the game to follow this up.\nHe did say about 245 people will be in attendance, so you should have \na good time.\nFrank Sumption and I were both on their speaking agenda to talk and \nuse some new devices for half the group at a time, but I heard Frank \nmight not be able to make it either.\n\nI hope to meet you and April at a future event sometime...\n\n- Mike (UFO Geek)\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Allen&quot; &lt;amuck944@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike,\n&gt;\n&gt; I like the microphone. What did you use if you don&#39;t mind giving\n&gt; specifics?\n&gt;\n&gt; April and I will be at the Stanley also. We will be selling TAPS\n&gt; merchandise and magazines. Stop by if you get a chance. We would\n&gt; like to meet you.\n&gt;\n&gt; Allen Slaughter"}
