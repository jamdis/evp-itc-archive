Although I&#39;d love to have the 3, the package would probably be better for me.\n\nI&#39;ve bought things from China in the past, and although it&#39;s a long wait, the stuff is usually good. But once I got a portable cd writer, and they sent me the case only. When I told them they advertised it in the title as a writer, they said that was just keywords. So I lost money on that, and am now cautious about buying from China. I waited over 2 months for something that wasn&#39;t even what I purchased. Grrrr....\n\n~Draiga\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Draiga\n&gt; \n&gt; ok so if you have a camcorder that already has tv in. that will work if not then you have to get a min dvr here is a link where you can find them..some are really not expensive down side there Hong Kong I didnt want to be bother with that cause i have no patience lol. you can find some that is in us as well here is a link\n&gt; http://shop.ebay.com/i.html?rt=nc&LH_PrefLoc=1&_nkw=portable%20dvr&_fln=1&_trksid=p3286.c0.m283\n&gt;  \n&gt; now if money is tight i would suggest going with a not so expensive model.. I went with the best because well my hubby said i wouldn&#39;t be happy with less (so true especailly knowing this was out there lol) but all the models are good and for its a investment.
