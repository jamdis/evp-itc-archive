<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>A thirty second .wav file costs about 5mb to 6mb, in .mp3 format it is
@ 540kb. Most of my message files, which are about 3 to 5 seconds
(contain 10 to 20 words) are 27kb to 40kb. A huge difference!

I think thats a pretty good measure to go by. If you are posting a
single message file and it is close to 1mb, then its probably too big.

Frank R.

&gt; Hi, Misty.  
&gt; 
&gt; I am deleting some of my files, but is there a file size that is 
&gt; appropriate?  Though I posted audio in .wav files, they actually seem 
&gt; pretty small in file size.  I do not have time to convert these and 
&gt; wonder if they are OK the way they are?  
&gt; 
&gt; Please advise...  :)

&gt; &gt; Hello all. It&#x27;s that time again for me to remind you that the group 
&gt; &gt; is low on space (96% used) and actions will be taken. For now 
&gt; rather 
&gt; &gt; than delete everyones files I am asking that you convert your wav 
&gt; &gt; format into mp3 or smaller format before you post them to the files 
&gt; &gt; area.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; One member using 10+ megs out of our groups 100 total megs just 
&gt; isnt 
&gt; &gt; going to fly anymore. So starting in May all files that are not 
&gt; &gt; within size limits and arent in smallest formats will have to start 
&gt; &gt; to get deleted.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For those who cant convert your files I have programs that are free 
&gt; &gt; to help you do that. For those that dont want to convert your 
&gt; files, 
&gt; &gt; you can use esnips to post your larger files and share them with 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; group as links in posts. For those that ignore my posts and do what 
&gt; &gt; you want to anyway, your stuff will be deleted and your option to 
&gt; &gt; upload and share here in group will be disabled.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As I said we have 100 (one hundred) megs total in file section for 
&gt; &gt; sharing, please do not abuse your share of that space. As you can 
&gt; see 
&gt; &gt; there are others who like to share too. Eventually we may just 
&gt; clean 
&gt; &gt; it out of everyones files but for now lets try and stick to 
&gt; &gt; compacting the things we upload and make use of places like esnips 
&gt; &gt; for sharing.
&gt; &gt;
