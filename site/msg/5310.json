You will most likely still hear \nfragments of radio, but if i hear nothing i disregard it.  Box \nresearch is different than traditional EVP, it&#39;s radio so you either \nhear it or you don&#39;t.  And as you do it, you will hear the difference \nbetween radio and spirit voices.  It does take time, but rewarding to \nbe able to achieve this type of communication.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rebecca&quot; &lt;rak4dds@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Steve --\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your reply.  So, if we have 14 min of dead time \n&gt; before &quot;clyde&quot; appears and you edit the 14 mins, is there any other \n&gt; radio band &quot;noise&quot; that appears or is it simply quiet?  Also, can \nyou \n&gt; be so sure that deleting these 14 mins that there aren&#39;t other \n&gt; messages on other frequencies to retrieve?\n&gt; \n&gt; Greatly appreciate your opinion on this matter,\n&gt; \n&gt; - Rak\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I edit my files to display the answer, i.e---if i ask what is \nyour \n&gt; name \n&gt; &gt; and 14 seconds later they say &quot;clyde&quot;.  At that point i will cut \n&gt; out \n&gt; &gt; the 14 seconds of nothing and just leave the answer to my \n&gt; question.  \n&gt; &gt; Sometimes i have to make the file a bit louder, but no mods to \nthe \n&gt; &gt; actual file.  It is what it is and i leave it in raw format for \nall \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; hear, the less you mess with the files is better to bring people \n&gt; onto \n&gt; &gt; this side of the fence.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rebecca&quot; &lt;rak4dds@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello All -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been studying this format of communication for better \npart \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; year now.  I have been listening to clips and reading posts \nhere \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometime and am impressed with direction of your work.  The \n&gt; majority \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; clips I&#39;ve listened to, regardless of the type of box used, are \n&gt; quite \n&gt; &gt; &gt; clear.  My question to you is as follows:  are the files edited \n&gt; or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; changed at all or is this the quality they are coming through \n&gt; at?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Rak\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
