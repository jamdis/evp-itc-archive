She may be 80, but she is full of piss and vinegar Frank.  I'm 1/2 her age and doubt if I could keep up with her, lol!

    Yes, the old "demon chasing" crap, once again. 

I brought the following thought up elsewhere and will bring it up 
here for consideration, too. If ghosts are coming through the box 
and thus are not in a good state of mind, how come on Paranormal 
State CM was willing to believe the message given by the ghost via 
the box as being truth (The ghost via the box said a "demon" was 
holding the ghosts captive there)? 

I would suggest that perhaps a ghost (assuming we are talking about a 
disembodied person who remains earthbound) is not in a healthy state 
of mind one would consider "stable," but trapped in emotional trauma 
of some sort. Thus, how reliable could the message of a ghost then 
be? ;)
