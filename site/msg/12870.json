No matter how nice someone seems to be, it may not be \nso.  A rule I saw somewhere emphasized this - &quot;A person who is nice to you \nbut is not nice to the waiter is NOT a nice person.&quot;\n\nZack\n\nOn Fri, 21 Nov 2008, Clara Febach wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello Frank and All,\n&gt; �\n&gt; Dave and his wife Sharon are founders of the International Ghost Hunters Society.� They make a lot of money selling equipment, teaching and certifying people who are willing to pay the enormous prices they charge.
