C=
arradine Death Was Accidental

IMDb, June 4, 2009

David Carradine died dur=
ing a sex game that went wrong, according to sources in Bangkok, Thailand, =
where he was found dead on Thursday.

Carradine's body was discovered in a =
hotel suite and local reports suggested he committed suicide. 

He was disc=
overed by a maid, naked and hanged, but the suggestions his death had a sex=
ual twist were strongly disputed by the star's close friend, attorney Vicki=
 Roberts, and his manager Chuck Binder, who insisted he died of natural cau=
ses. 

But a statement from Carradine's representative now indicates the ac=
tor died during a sex act.

The spokesperson tells TMZ.com, "We can confirm=
 100 percent that he never would have committed suicide. It was an accident=
al death. Everybody is in shock." 

Rumours Carradine died attempting auto-=
erotic asphyxiation- -where victims achieve heightened sexual pleasure by r=
estricting their air supply are backed up by a quote a Bangkok police offic=
er gave to British newspaper The Sun. 

The cop tells reporters, "A rope wa=
s attached to his neck and also to his penis". 

Rocker Michael Hutchence w=
as rumoured to have died attempting the same sex act in a Sydney, Australia=
, hotel room back in 1997--although his death was officially declared a sui=
cide.

Carradine was in Thailand to shoot the movie "Stretch." He was 72.
