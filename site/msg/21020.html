<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>and yet, somehow, I get this stuff to work, from scratch, that is I build all my circuits. I don&#x27;t care what the value of anything is, I have a universal sweep circuit that is adapted to many different radios. The &quot;frequency&quot; is not fixed, so why calculate it?
 
 If I don&#x27;t have any 56K resistors, I use 51K, If I don&#x27;t have any 51K resistors, I use 47K. Sometimes I use a 100uf cap for timing, sometimes I want if faster, so use 22uf. When was the last time I calculated anything--ahhh, never! Can&#x27;t do math. I learned from a tech in the Army, an absolute electroinc genius, never calculated anything, just throw the damn thing together and forget it. We stayed up one night, built an o&#x27;scope from scratch using junk parts.

 Ain&#x27;t gonna thevenize the damn thing either!

 In the months you&#x27;ve spent dicking around with precision crapola, you could have made a dozen boxes. It&#x27;s not friggin&#x27; rocket science! 

 For those not technical, Thevenin&#x27;s theorem is a stupid concept of figuring out the voltage, current, and resistance for any given circuit, it&#x27;s on every freaking electronics test, it&#x27;s absolutely useless, yet all these brainiacs include it in evertything. 

 No wonder all the engineers out there that attempt boxes can not make them work, they way, way, way over think the process!
