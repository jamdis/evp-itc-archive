All the comments and sarcasm make it clear to me\nthat my points and attempts here are lost. I&#39;m not new to the field\nand I know the importance of having some protocol but... not everyone\nfeels the same. That&#39;s okay. Unless your like Frank R and are only in\nthis for yourself, then your truly not a serious researcher in the\ntrue definition of the word. \nI do appreciate everyone&#39;s time though. I won&#39;t bother anyone here\nagain. My email address is babiarz3@... for those who wish to\ncontinue the discussion. Take care everyone.\n\nBabs\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; If I misunderstood, then I certainly apologize.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps we&#39;d react differently if you participated here more often-- \n&gt; posting your own files and asking questions of researchers. For  \n&gt; example, &quot;Hey, Ann--that file you just posted, I hear what you do,  \n&gt; but is anything clipped out of it? I think I hear a track silenced,  \n&gt; too. If so, why did you do that?&quot; Then I get to answer and explain  \n&gt; why I did it that way, offer the raw clip, or whatever. It doesn&#39;t  \n&gt; come off as a broad attack--just a friendly question. Even Bruce  \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t rip out your living eyeballs for that. (Well... maybe he  \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t, anyway. ;) )\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree with your search for The Truth. I really do. That&#39;s why you  \n&gt; see me get all rough-and-tumble over stuff like the Luminator when I  \n&gt; think it is it lacking convincing evidence. But it&#39;s waaaaaay too  \n&gt; early in &quot;boxology&quot; to try to make it perform as a pet circus animal.  \n&gt; Hell, we&#39;ve been studying traditional EVP for 30 years and it still  \n&gt; won&#39;t perform on cue for the scientists or anyone else. But if you  \n&gt; just listen to what you get on your own and what all the others are  \n&gt; getting, it becomes very clear indeed that a real phenomenon is  \n&gt; occurring. Sure, some things we get that we think are paranormal may  \n&gt; be just radio fragments, but one radio fragment does not negate all  \n&gt; box communication. One tweaked clip is not indicative of a culture of  \n&gt; researcher deceit. One &quot;I am Bazoozoo! Time to fry, foolish mortal!&quot;  \n&gt; does not mean that the RS hacks are pathways to Satan&#39;s indoor  \n&gt; plumbing. There are no easy answers yet--and there may never be any.  \n&gt; And I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re at the stage yet where we have the right to  \n&gt; demand The Truth or whether we would even see it if it was staring us  \n&gt; in the face.\n&gt; \n&gt; All right, enough joy in myself one-hand clapping.\n&gt; \n&gt; LC is right that if you want to try to pursue this in the way you  \n&gt; want to pursue it, then you need to find some people who share your  \n&gt; mindset and go to it. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to find those people  \n&gt; here, necessarily--at least among the old guard. We&#39;re the beatniks  \n&gt; in black leather, smoking ciggies and reading bad poetry to the beat  \n&gt; of bongos, HMO.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; On Jan 21, 2008, at 1:37 PM, babiarz3 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just to clear things up.. the file I&#39;m referring to is not from anyone\n&gt; &gt; involved in this group so when I say that occasionally I hear their\n&gt; &gt; voices become shaky, that is not a comment on anyone here. Also,\n&gt; &gt; please don&#39;t misread what I actually said. The point I made, or tried\n&gt; &gt; to make, about the investigators not hearing what I heard... I\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t have heard all of it in real time either. Too many layers,\n&gt; &gt; too fast, etc. I have the luxury now of sitting and analyzing the file\n&gt; &gt; in my own time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As for fear being a factor... I do believe that the attitude of the\n&gt; &gt; investigators present during a session does effect the outcome. Even\n&gt; &gt; Bruce who would rather cut my eyeballs out with a razor has said the\n&gt; &gt; same. If you think that I am scared, fine. If I&#39;m missing one thing it\n&gt; &gt; is probably a healthy dose of fear. Don&#39;t make the mistake of missing\n&gt; &gt; the points by name calling.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I post my thoughts here because it is an active group of people\n&gt; &gt; working with this form of ITC. You can call me a shit stirrer or\n&gt; &gt; whatever you want. The point is that I see issues that could be\n&gt; &gt; addressed fairly easily. You can ignore it or deflect all you want.\n&gt; &gt; For me, it&#39;s not about being friends, it&#39;s about the research.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Ratka &lt;warrior18eii@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Good answer!

Put the fricking radio\n&gt; &gt; down and go get another hobby. Leave it to those of us who aren&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; afraid and don&#39;t care if someone calls us a bitch or a slut and tries\n&gt; &gt; to pawn themselves off as Bazoozoo.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just. Stop. Listening. And. Worrying.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And on top of all that, in this quote below, you seem to be saying\n&gt; &gt; that the rest of us don&#39;t know what we&#39;re doing or are being fooled by\n&gt; &gt; entities that only you have sussed.

I&#39;d say at this point, and I&#39;m only 1/2 way through, 90%  \n&gt; &gt; of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; communication is negative in nature and mentions many supposed  \n&gt; &gt; Demonic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; names. The layers of voices are, in many cases, multiple. Often, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; listener hears very little of what is actually said.
