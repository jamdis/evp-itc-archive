Interesting . . . I have often wondered if the Ovilus creator uses a simila=

Interesting. .. so this device senses changing temper=
atures, etc and 
begins speaking differents words or phrases with these cha=
nges?

Humm... that 8-in-one paranormal box I put together a while back 
se=
nses many different things also, but I never thought about putting 
those s=
ensor inputs into a chip that speaks. I now uses meters and 
lights, and al=
arms when the thing senses different things. But I'm 
guessing I can tap in=
to the circuits and pick a place where the 
different voltages (ever changi=
ng) are and put those into the input 
of a speaking chip.

Humm... I may ju=
st have to open it up again and see what I can do...
