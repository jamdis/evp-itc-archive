    F-S, I certainly hope I didn't offend you=
 with anything I said.  I certainly do not claim to be a braniac or a know-=
it-all, as you have called me in your post.

        In fact I am saying th=
e opposite: I am saying that I do not know:  I am saying I do not know how =
anyone can believe these 2012 predictions when all they have is stories and=
 questionable claims.  I don't know how they can believe this stuff when th=
ey actually DO have evidence that all the similar claims in the past have b=
een shown to be false. I do not know why they believe this claim is any mor=
e justified than all the others,

        I do not know how the group can s=
ay on its home page " It's one thing to be skeptical, it's another to ignor=
e and deny all evidence.", yet it is the people who are certain of the 2012=
 prophecies that seem to be ignoring and denying evidence that it is only o=
ne more in a long line of unsupported failed predictions, not those who are=
 skeptical of it.

        I do not know how it justifies you referring to =
me as  a "wanne be brianiacs claiming to know all", when the group home pag=
e suggests such attacks get people banned.  I do not know how being skeptic=
al of a future prophecy makes one a know it all. And I do not know how prom=
pting people to judge for themselves makes me a know it all. 

        And =
I don't know why the group home page says a good argument is ok, yet you st=
art name-calling offended when someone questions something you do not agree=
 with, or proposes a theory alternate to your own.

        So call me igno=
rant.  Obviously I really don't know very much at all.  

        But of th=
e very few things I do know, I now it is good to question, and not take eve=
rything, especially prophecies, at face value.  And I know the best way to =
test a prophecy, and the people making them, is to see if they actually com=
e to pass.  And I know that since no evidence can support a prophecy's trut=
h until it comes to pass, and since all past end-of-world prophecies have n=
o evidence of their success, that those who think they know something speci=
al about why 2012 is different, certainly know more than I.

        And so=
 I hope they (or you, if you count yourself among them) will post your evid=
ence, and your predictions, and your dates.  And we won't have to argue abo=
ut it.  We can just put that person, and their predictions, and their dates=
, on our calendars, and judge when the date comes, who was really acting as=
 a know-it-all.  

        One thing I think we can all agree on:  one know=
s it all. Not me, not you, and certainly not a collapsed MesoAmerican civil=
ization.
