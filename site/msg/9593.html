  I think the spirits have always been communicating with you even before you started box research. You have just learned what to listen for. I think if we could record the mind chatter in our head like we record the box sessions we would get the same messages. In between the chatter I am sure we are getting spirit communication. We just need to slow down the mind chatter to listen to the messages.

They have no ears, so that must be it.  One thing I tried recently is before I record, I let the spirits hear their recordings before I start.  I am trying to get the spirits to give me their first and last names rapid fire much the way I have been getting from some spirits where they call out my first and last name all at once.  I have only had one spirit give me his full first and last name, but the others its just first name basis.  So I got the idea to let them hear how they sound after I recorded them, and how those spirits sound that rapid fire my first and last name at once. It is killing me as i have not been able to record since Thursday. My wife does not want me to record when the kids are in the house, and I cant record when my wife is in the house either. Regardless, the spirits seem to know
 when I turn that radio on, so i don't feel bad that they might be sitting there waiting for me...  So now before each recording, I let them listen to the previous recordings before I turn the recorder and radio on.

  In the field of parapsychology, clairaudience [from late 17th century French clair (clear) & audience (hearing)] is where a person acquires information by paranormal auditory means. It is often considered to be a form of clairvoyance. Clairaudience is essentially the ability to hear in a paranormal manner, as opposed to paranormal seeing (clairvoyance) and feeling (clairsentience). Clairaudient people have psi-mediated hearing. Clairaudience may refer not to actual perception of sound, but may instead indicate impressions of the "inner mental ear" similar to the way many people think words without having auditory impressions. But it may also refer to actual perception of sounds such as voices, tones, or noises which are not apparent to other humans or to recording equipment. For instance, a clairaudient person might claim to hear the voices or thoughts of the spirits of persons who are deceased. 
   
  I have had this happen many many times. Mostly just before I am falling asleep (when the mind chatter starts to settle down). I don't feel what I am hearing is really spoken out loud but it is heard in my head. Hope that makes since. For any of you that meditate you know what I mean by this.
