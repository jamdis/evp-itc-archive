  Honey as soon as =
you turn audition on, it should have asked you.  If not try going into your=
 file section and you should be able to recover it as the last session and/=
or file done.

  Hi Rees,

      Audition can recover an unsaved session in case the progr=
am (or
      computer) should crash.

      But perhaps it was intention th=
at the session was not saved - who
