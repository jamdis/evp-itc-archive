<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just wanted to say Happy New Year to the group; I&#x27;m so glad to have
found this forum and the intelligent and contemplative people that
frequent it!

I&#x27;ve been listening to recordings I took at my first private home
investigation last week, and had my first bona fide EVP today. I&#x27;ve
heard things in person, but this is the first time I actually had it
recorded and I&#x27;m psyched -- I think this next year is going to be a
doozie!

I&#x27;ll post it once I&#x27;ve had a chance to isolate it in Audacity and
listen a few times. Anyway ~ 

Happy New Year and much progress &amp; success in this next year!</pre>
