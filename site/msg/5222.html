<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>There are several application for voice recognition (VR). Most cel
phones can be trained to recognize voice prints from your spoken word
which creates a pattern. Microsoft&#x27;s Vista OS has voice recognition
included for free so basic functions (open file, view, play, save, and
so on) can be done with a mic and your voice. It can be integrated
into Word so you can speak and a letter can be composed. But this type
of VR just uses a stored voice pattern and can adapted to identify the
 person who was recorded assuming there is a known sample of the
persons voice that can be referenced. VR software of this type is
usually priced between $100 to $200 if it&#x27;s not included for free with
another software bundle.

Another type of VR is used for voice stress analysis. One of the more
popular ones is Truster. You can buy this as software or as portable
hardware piece that has an audio in jack. It measures the inflections
that usually indicate the stress of attempted deception. It goes for
around $95.

In evp&#x27;s it&#x27;s more a matter of isolating the frequency of the sound as
by their very nature evp&#x27;s are inaudible. The audio sampling software
I have seen allow you to easily display the frequency range. The
voiced speech of a typical adult male with have an average frequency
of from 85 to 155 Hz, and that of a typical adult female from 165 to
255 Hz. Humans can hear sounds at frequencies between 20Hz to
20,000Hz. Evp&#x27;s are usually in the very low range, below what most of
can hear even if they are above 20Hz.

For Box recordings, we&#x27;ll have to be creative. With the rapid audio
shifts it would be a challenge but I like the idea of further
analyzing the recordings. -Bill

&gt; Ron,
&gt;  
&gt; I have not heard of any voice recognition systems that would enable
you to recognise
&gt; a recorded evp from a box or traditional.
&gt; I believe the simple reason being that evp&#x27;s that come from any type
of box we use today run on the same
&gt; principle, the words are created by the entities using random bits
of radio signal or pieces of radio chatter 
&gt; that is being scanned by the box.
&gt;  
&gt; Traditional evp is based on the theory that the spirit leaving the
message uses the ambient energy in the surrounding area
&gt; and manipulates it into words that are captured by the recorder.
&gt;  
&gt; both of these methods are very monotone is essence the box replies
are made up of different word fragments and not fluid enough.
&gt; The traditional evp message sounds very whispered or pitchy and is
filled with white noise and recorder static.
&gt;  
&gt; The voice recognition software being used today is like misty said
very expensive and is designed to recognise the inflections in human
speech
&gt; it is mainly used by forensic labs to determine if two speech
patterns are the same.
&gt;  
&gt; My opinion is that the software would not be capable of detecting
evp messages, I have not personally tried it but had the idea many
moons ago
&gt; and researched the possibility.

&gt; 
&gt; Theres some great software out there. Problem is the really good
ones have big price tags. Id have to use them before I could comment
on them. Clear Voice Denoiser works pretty well for me and what I do.
Ive been using it almost from the start along with the p1 filter for
all my water sessions. It&#x27;s become part of my standard practice. The
p1 helps bring the voices out without destroying the other noise.. or
it can destroy most of the noise, its up to you and your settings.
Clear voice free demo works on all clips under 30 seconds which is
fine for most evp work. I liked the program enough I bought it to
support thier work. 
&gt;  
&gt; Heres one from last night, may hear her maybe not. LOL but at least
ya can see the before and after results of filtered or unfiltered and
how CV raises the voice level. It works especially well for the -74
speed voices, gives them a giant boost in tone levels. Not so whispery.
&gt;  
&gt; This one is just normal speed, as recorded.

&gt; Bruce&#x27;s test with unlabeled messages brings up a question I have
about howEVP-ITC@ yahoogroups.com to better decipher what is being
said on the other side (particularly for those of us who can&#x27;t hear
too well).  Is there a computer Voice Recognition system that can be used.
&gt;  
&gt; On this subject, I recently saw a video on  AOL about a secret
sentence that actor Bill Murray mumbled at the very end of a
movie...don&#x27;t recall the name of the movie.  Technicians somehow
processed the sound to make the message VERY clear and precise.  Even
I could understand the sentence.   In the program you could hear the
stepped improvements of the signal till it was stepped up to the point
of clarity.  Would that be possible or even useful for EVPs??  If so,
how could I do that?????   Ron L
