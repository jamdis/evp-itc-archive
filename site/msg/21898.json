I recently\n&gt; went on an investigation to a public place with a  paranormal group. While\n&gt; my experience is much less than theirs, I found them to be too disorganized.\n&gt; Three people came from the group. One had no equipment and the second used\n&gt; his cell phone. I never even saw a pencil. So, I started a small group,\n&gt; specifically for amateur investigators staying in local public places so we\n&gt; don&#39;t get in over our heads. We aren&#39;t trying to get any resident\n&gt; investigations and are non competitive. On our site I put photos and evps I\n&gt; had gotten while on the investigation and put at the bottom that some\n&gt; evidence was obtained while on investigations with other groups. I didn&#39;t\n&gt; use any of their names. As with any of my photos, I blocked out any faces,\n&gt; and it was all on my equipment. I signed nothing and agreed to nothing.\n&gt; Yesterday he sent me an email saying he wants it taken down. It&#39;s\n&gt; technically and legally his ( technically and legally?). If I wanted to\n&gt; start my own group all I had to do was ask. He has said that I invited a 16\n&gt; year old to join the group (Definitely didn&#39;t). And that he thought I would\n&gt; join their group.\n&gt; -I don&#39;t believe he&#39;s right on the legal issue. Ethically, I would have\n&gt; accredited the group if he was more diplomatic and maybe even taken it down.\n&gt;\n&gt; - wouldn&#39;t making false accusations make him guilty of liable?\n&gt; - I don&#39;t need to ask him to do ****. I&#39;ve met him twice.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anybody know of any place where I can find something written on the law\n&gt; about those photos and media being mine.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Vicky\n&gt;"}
