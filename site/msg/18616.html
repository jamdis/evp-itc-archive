attacked ?? Wow , how dramatic... It's just a fact that you will make Frank
mad again.
For instance: IT is very obvious that when Frank gets something from the box
about
stuff that says what is going to happen, YOU have to say I will add that to
your predictions.
Those are not Frank's predictions, he is just posting the messages, and it
is very clear
that he does not like you saying or posting that those are his
predictions.....
Maybe you should pick your words a little better in the future, or better
yet, maybe you should just
not say anything, and just put the info in your little files to save, and no
one would be 
the wiser..
I'm tired of giving you so much time in this group, so I hope I don't have
to ATTACK you anymore LOL

BTW, if anyone is wondering what I am talking about, this was a good
example.
I offer a suggestion on getting things back on track with less hostility,
and I am immediately attacked for making the suggestion.

that would be fine, if you didn't piss Frank off....... But you do.....
AND THAT IS NOT OKAY.....
The same thing will happen when you do it again....
So what's the point in you being here.

I expect none of us like all the recent attacks, insults, accusations,
threats, hurting of feelings, and attempts to piss people off. 

Can I suggest we stick to the purpose of the group: "the discussion,
promotion, and developemnt of Electronic Voice Phenomenon, and Instrumental
Transcommunication methods and technologies as used in the communication
with spirit, and other entities."

And that we go with Frank's philosophy "just take the approach, try
different methods, see what works."

No more threats. No name calling, insults, or accusations. Just try to keep
a positive group attitude, be open that not everyone believes what everyone
else does, and that's ok?
