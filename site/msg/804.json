{"id": "804", "subject": "The Intelligence Project Description...", "author": "Guy", "timestamp": "2007-03-07T04:08:11Z", "full_text": "[Note: the project is complete so don&#39;t try to sign up]\n\n\nThe Intelligence Project \n\nA Project involving EVP and Listening\n\nIf you have done EVP for a while you will already know whether or \nnot what you say is responded to sometimes - you will already know \nif there seems to be some sort of awareness there.\n\nYou may believe this to be so, and so may I, but the world in \ngeneral will just take this as further evidence of \nour &quot;deteriorating mental ability&quot;!\n\nYou can&#39;t prove anything - all you can do is state your firm belief \nand perhaps back that up with some examples which you hope don&#39;t \nsound too &quot;made-up&quot;.\n\nThis project aims to deal with that situation once and for all.  We \nbelieve in working with science rather than against it.  Science is \nnot our enemy, nor indeed is scepticism.\n\nMethod\nWhat we want to find out is if there is any relationship between \nwhat the experimenter says and the type of EVP responses that we get.\n\nWe are looking for signs of intelligence.\n\nWe want to do that in a measurable way - for that is the way of \nscience.  And this is the way that has been approved by a major \nEuropean pharmaceutical company for funding.\n\nWe have six questions. These questions are decided on in advance.  \n\nDuring the experiment the experimenter asks each of the questions, \nin turn, with a 30-second gap after each question to allow any \nresponses to be recorded. \n\nSo (for example) what you would get is,\n\nQuestion &#39;What is the time?&#39; \n[30 seconds delay]; \nQuestion &#39;What is your name?&#39; \n[30 seconds delay], \nQuestion &#39;What do you like best?&#39;\n[30 second delay]\nand so on.\n\nNow if an utterance is heard within the 30-second period and if the \nutterance sounds as though it could be a response to the question, \nthen it is treated as an actual response.  For example if we hear \nthe utterance &#39;John Smith&#39; seven seconds after the question &#39;What is \nyour name?&#39; is asked, then that looks like a response to that \nquestion.\n\nThe experimenter carries out the session, asking each of the \nquestions in turn; and then the recording of the session is turned \nover to a speech analyst.\n\nThe analyst picks out from the general background noise all the \nutterances he can find in the recording.  He refines his search \nstill further by selecting out the 16 utterances of the best \nquality. (sometimes it will be less than 16), and &quot;shuffles&quot; these \nso that you will not know which came first, which came second and so \non.\n\nThe final 16 utterances, their order shuffled, are sent out to you.\n\nWhat you are asked to do is decide if any of the utterances could be \na response to any of the questions, and to fill in a table like that \nshown in the example below.\n\nTrack No.\tCould be a response to Question Number..\nBR01\t                               4\nBR02\t                               0\nBR03\t                               0\nBRO4\t                               3\nBR05\t                               1\nBR06\t                               2\nBR07\t                               3\nBRO8\t                               3\nBR09\t                               6\nBR10\t                               0\nBR11\t                               0\nBR12\t                               0\nBR13\t                               6\nBR14\t                               5\nBR15\t                               0\nBR16\t                               0\n \nAs you can see some utterances are not considered to be a response \nto any of the questions, and so a &#39;0&#39; is inserted at that point.  \nThis is not an easy test, that is why you are being asked to help.\n\nPlease send your results to XXX@... and then they will get put \ninto our database - and in time we will be told the results.\n\nMeanwhile, however, preliminary results look quite promising  and \nyour assistance on this vital project is very much appreciated!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGuy"}
