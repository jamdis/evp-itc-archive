<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t know what to do about it--oh yeah, see below! I&#x27;ve had 
arguements in the past and almost got fired cuz the other person 
forwarded all my responses to my boss, who happened to be my e-mail 
provider. I don&#x27;t want to go there again. 

 I have to ask, or wish I could ask, if these people are possessed 
before, or after box use? I suspect it&#x27;s before, I hope it&#x27;s before, 
or I have some serious karma to deal with. 

 It is a federal crime to threaten and intimidate using e-mail and 
the internet, and the FBI does have an on-line reporting center. It&#x27;s 
title 18 something.

&gt; Hi Frank,
&gt;  
&gt; I know this is all stupid and some of us have really had enough of  
it.  
&gt; Especially being called childish names and being swore at and  
threatened.  But it 
&gt; hasn&#x27;t stopped in private emails?
&gt;  
&gt; This is such the case.  And now it has come down to physical 
threats  because 
&gt; well maybe that&#x27;s all these neanderthals know or can understand.   
ANd yes it 
&gt; has been reported to the proper authorities but what do you 
recommend  be 
&gt; done about iy.
&gt;  
&gt; Your opinion would be greatly appreiated.

&gt; Huh!? I can only say, I don&#x27;t have to do this group thing either, 
I  
&gt; stay cuz a few request it. The guys actually talk more if I don&#x27;t  
&gt; share. 
&gt; 
&gt; I can understand where Bruce was coming fom, to a point,  but when 
&gt; you start making threatening private e-mails to make sure  everyone 
&gt; agrees with you, that&#x27;s just demented and wrong. This shit ain&#x27;t  
&gt; that important!
