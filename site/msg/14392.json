I have found quite a few voices that I\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t have noticed hadn&#39;t I first heard a &quot;pop&quot; sound. Actually had to do\n&gt; some MAJOR enhancing on 2 of them to even hear them at all. I mean one was\n&gt; impossibly buried in the noise. But after slowing it down I got a &quot;wiff&quot; of\n&gt; it, and through more passes of the Audacity effects I was rewarded with a\n&gt; female voice. It was sad though...she said in a mechanical pattern &quot;can -\n&gt; you - help- me.........please - help. Still, the audio is so painfully low.\n&gt; Hearing her plea will forever effect me. Hopefully I can find someoneone\n&gt; here that can hear them as well as I. That can verify this for me :) I hear\n&gt; it...but is nice to know someone else is there with you :) I went back to\n&gt; that location little over an hour later (after found the voice) Is under 1\n&gt; mile from me. It&#39;s a real sad thing to hear and not knowing what to do.Jim H\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nWeasels Ripped My Flesh!\n:-)\nÂ \nZack\nOn Sun, May 17, 2009 a 6:07 PM, Rick as e e @yahoo.com> w o e:\n\n\n\n\n\nWeasel spi i s. \n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoog oups.com, \"James W.
