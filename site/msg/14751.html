There is absolutely no evidence pointing towards PK phenomena. The homeowne=
rs were not present during the investigation. These surges can easily be ex=
plained as mundane and therefore we must assume it is. If we can't rule out=
 all mundane sources, then we have to assume it is not paranormal.

These w=
ere electrical surges. The only time we had EMF spikes was when these taps =
would be heard. The meter would spike, and then immediately return to 0.

Do your readings in your notes? Were you reading electrical or magnetic
fie=
lds? What type of EMF meter were you using?"

Yes we logged all readings. W=
e were reading EMF, so a bit of both. We had several types of meters presen=
t. At one point, we had 2 KII meters a few feet apart in the living room. O=
n some taps, one would go off, and others, the other one would go off. Most=
 spikes fell in the 2.5 mg range, but a couple went off the scale.

Again, these surges were constant, =
though not uniform.

  What I have been hearin=
g on this since the first posting is a single
  tap that sounds like wood o=
n wood. Since the tapping was continual
  and you noticed an EM spike there=
 is another possibility.

  You could have detected a PK event. In polterge=
ist cases we have come
  to realize that living PK agents often are respons=
ible. These agents
  function in environments with specific characteristics=
 and themselves
  exhibit specific traits. One of the environmental charact=
eristics is
  an elevated magnetic field. Often this is a geomagnetic field=
 as seems
  to be the case in extreme poltergeist cases. Less extremem case=
s, 
  such as this may be, we often see elevated EM field levels. Do your
 =
 readings in your notes? Were you reading electrical or magnetic
  fields? =
What type of EMF meter were you using? This might help
  determine if the i=
nfo you noticed was potentially related to PK
  effects.
