<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Everyone,

I have to agree with Zack, however getting validation can be very difficult.

I have heard from a spirit person who identified himself as Michael Jackson via mediumship.  I am trying to get Deepak Chopra to examine the transcript.  He knew Michael Jackson personally and should be able to verify the contents. I have sent several emails to Deepak Chopra&#x27;s publicist.  She keeps reading them but not responding.  The transcript is very personal and I am keeping it private but I was left with something that I can make public.

This is word for word:
&quot;If people ask how I am doing tell them I am trying to figure this all out.  I love my children very much and I am so sad on the affect this will have on them.  Bye for now Michael.&quot;

If anyone has a suggestion or direct contact information for Deepak Chopra please let me know.  I am in San Diego within short driving distance of the Chopra Center. 

Thx,

&gt; because someone says he or she is person &quot;X&quot; doesn&#x27;t prove it unless you get
&gt; something only that person and a few others may know. If someone were able
&gt; to spell my mother&#x27;s maiden name you&#x27;d have something!
&gt; 
&gt; I get all sorts of e-mails from wealthy people in far away places wanting to
&gt; give it away to me.

&gt; &gt; Well would you guys think I&#x27;m nuts if I told you I have a short EVP from
&gt; &gt; Michael Jackson? I was at a park here in Des Moines, Iowa on June 28th. The
&gt; &gt; name of the location is Prospect Park. In the original file I ask if MJ can
&gt; &gt; hear me.....and I get a &quot;yes I can&quot;. Well then I run this through a denoise
&gt; &gt; program and I hear &quot;yes I can&quot; then a second later I hear a young boy with a
&gt; &gt; mockish tone say &quot;your talking in the last mike&quot; (also think I hear a young
&gt; &gt; girl later but can&#x27;t make it out)*I MIGHT understand the girl, but won&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; make a statement at this time. The boy is easier to hear in the denoised
&gt; &gt; program (better than Michael). BUT both voices are hard to hear. Maybe you
&gt; &gt; can amplify for yourself.....that way I won&#x27;t SPLATTER the audio to much and
&gt; &gt; you might be able to adjust for yourself. If someone wants the unedited WAV
&gt; &gt; file that&#x27;s 1.16MB I can send to email address. That way you might be able
&gt; &gt; to -denoise- or enhance MUCH better than I am able to. I can just make out
&gt; &gt; what is said........but I assure you&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it is in there!!! I am sending the
&gt; &gt; MP3 to my files folder, it is the denoised version. I&#x27;m not to familiar with
&gt; &gt; the denoise program so I think I used the default settings. Jim H
