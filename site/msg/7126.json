Evepmaker worked reallly well \nfro me, but i kept getting messages realyed from spirits that \ncouldn&#39;t use the computer, by the ones that could. I was ewondering \nwhat else I could use, and after aobut a week, the whole copncept of \nthe box kinda popped int my head fully formed. I think it was my own \nsubconcious mind that assembeld information from past experience, and \npresented it as a solutuion to the problem. I had worked wijht these \nradio modules from car stereos a few years previous, and knew they \ncold be voltage tuned, so I come up wiht an analog version of \nEVPmaker, pretty much. \n\n Frank-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sdudly&quot; &lt;sdudly@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank,\n&gt; \n&gt; To start off with no I do not want a box. =) \n&gt; \n&gt; However, I do have a question for you when you have time.  I was \njust\n&gt; curious as to where you got the inspiration for the box. \n&gt; \n&gt; Was it just an idea that popped into your head or did you have help\n&gt; from the other side?  Not to take any credit away from you at all \nwith\n&gt; your accomplishments with the box. It was just something I was \ncurious\n&gt; about.\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe I am looking for personal answers from the other side but\n&gt; also I feel it may help me with some more general directions I may\n&gt; want to go in after putting my own personal demons to rest. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your time in advance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; TT\n&gt;"}
