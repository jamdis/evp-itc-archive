Exactly. Or if you do enhance, keep the original as is for comparison.

ear is what you get





        There is no one opinion or consensus on ho=
w or if to filter or "enhance".   The problem is that these programs do not=
 understand what speech is either - otherwise you could press a button and =
have it just pull out the words and hrow everything else away.    They work=
 only by manipulating frequencies or frequency ranges.  

        To some p=
oint, they can recognize noise: but not all noise, and will remove some thi=
ngs that are not noise, and leave some things behind that are noise.  Carvi=
ng out frequencies in this manner can result in sounds being created which =
were not on the original recording, and sound like words.

        The same=
 is true with other kinds of enhancement, which again can quiet some freque=
ncies and emphasize others.  Since the program again does not know what is =
really a word and what is noise, sounds are again being reshaped, and with =
enough shaping, they can become like speech.  This is sometimes called pixe=
lization.

        Some are of the opinion to not filter or enhance at all:=
 it can be hard enough to identity real speech in a blank recording: tortur=
ing the frequencies just makes it more confusing.  Sure, it may result in m=
ore things that sound like speech, but it really depends what you are after=
: recording accuracy, or exciting results.  To get the best of both worlds,=
 it would seem the non-processed method would be best.

    =
    but not all noise, and will remove some things that are not noise, and =

        leave some things behind that are noise.  Carving out frequen=
cies 
        in this manner can result in sounds being created which were =
not on the 
        original recording, and sound like words.<BR><BR>The sa=
me is true with 
        other kinds of enhancement, which again can quiet =
some frequencies and 
        emphasize others.  Since the program aga=

re again being reshaped, and 
        with enough shaping, they can become =
like speech.  This is

        filter or enhance at all: it can be =
hard enough to identity real speech 
        in a blank recording: torturin=
