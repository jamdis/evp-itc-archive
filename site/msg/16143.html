<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have been a lurker here for sometime...   I find the subject fascinating, but my tecnnical skills are so limited I rarely feel like I can contribute anything to the group.  This post touched me so deeply, though, I felt I had to reply.

     I have lost a number of well loved animal companions over the years, from Black Labs to White Ferrets to cats of various persuasions.  (The most recent being a tawny colored short-hair named O&#x27;Rafferty, who looked like a pigmy puma.)  

     While I have little experience with animal EVP&#x27;s, I have no doubt that I will see them all again someday.  If they are not waiting for me on the other side, I&#x27;m not going...

     Would love to see posts from anyone that has experience with animal EVP&#x27;s or other proof of companion animal survival.  Do those on the other side have anything to say about this subject?

     I deeply sympathise with your loss...   Just reading your post brought tears to my eyes.

&gt;   Description : My Cat (my best friend) was DOA to the Animal Rescue Leage here in town. IHe was missing for 4 days and on Friday I went to the pound and found that he had been struck by a car (the first night he didn&#x27;t come home). Severe spinal injury and they had to give him the shot. I asked about him (on the other side)...well seems like they don&#x27;t have the answers either. Glad tjey heard me though.....maybe he does too. Gonna miss him.
