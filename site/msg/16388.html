Michelle,

Here is my expiation based on my experiences and what i know abo=
ut the other side from other spiritual experiences. 

Why do ghosts lie? We=
ll some of them don't they just base everything they say on past events on =
the life they just died from.  Once they pass from the outher side to the l=
ight then they will learn about the love of the world and where things make=
 more sense.  Now why do they not pass into the light? Who knows, its based=
 on what they consider judgment of themselves by God or they want to stay a=
round to see family grow or wait till a love one passes. So saying that the=
 ghost knows nothing about future or current events just past events that t=
hey were alive for. Now notice that your guides or spirits that pass on can=
not give us any information other than currents events or reassure you of t=
hings going to be OK or express love for who you are and what people and Go=
d see of you. Im still in the park that events happen due to human hands an=
d not what God says, but God helps when you need it most and are not afraid=
 to ask him and the things you NEED (not want)
 will come to pass in some s=
trange way. Anyway im getting off tangent lol.  Another thing im sure you h=
ave noticed is demons will assume the shape of a loved one or another spiri=
t and just spit lies and fear to you or in EVP's.  I think frank gets a lot=
 of this building radios. They will just blatantly lie just to see you get =
in trouble or cause heartache for you or people close to you.  If you want =
me to explain more then let me know but im not sure ill post it here on the=
 forum unless people really want to hear. 

Onyx

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Why do =
entities lie?

  


Hello, all.

My name is Michelle.  I'm a certified medi=
um with a Spiritualist church.  This was a two year process which involved =
proving I can communicate with spirits to a  congregation (not bragging - j=
ust trying to explain my background and why I know what I do). I'm also one=
 of the biggest skeptics you'll ever meet (It was one of two reasons I beca=
me a medium.  I wanted to see how they were "faking" it.  Surprise!  They w=
eren't). I'd like to contribute what I've learned about spirits.  As Jill w=
rote, "I(t) really takes personal experience to believe this stuff exists".=


As to her main question of "Why do spirits lie", I don't think we can alw=
ays assume they're lying.  If the information comes through a medium, one o=
f the first items to address is whether or not the medium received the mess=
age correctly and then whether or not he/she interepreted it correctly and =
phrased it in a way that allowed the recipient to understand the spirit's m=
eaning.  There are a variety of ways spirits communicate with mediums; some=
 are easier than others to understand and pass on.  For the harder methods,=
 it would be possible for a medium to inadvertently misinterept the message=
 based on his/her past experiences. 

When we look at the question from the=
 connection to EVP's and ghost boxes, we have to examine a few items.  Was =
the spirit able to use the devices correctly to form the words he/she actua=
lly intended? This is a two step process. It can be difficult for them to n=
ot only pull the available energy into a useable form, but to also form the=
 correct words (think it as a foreigner learning English and saying "car" w=
hen they mean "star". They sound similar, but have very different meanings)=
. 

Did we understand the words they said?  It's fairly easy to get them wr=
ong, especially in instances where you aren't the first person to listen to=
 the recording and someone else says, "Here listen to this.  I think they'r=
e saying (fill in the blank)".  Our brains are going to tell us (fill in th=
e blank) simply because that thought is now prevalent.  If we're the only p=
erson listening to the recordings, the same mistake can be made.  The only =
conclusive way is to use equipment that can amplify and break down the reco=
rdings to make them clear enough to be agreed upon by a number of people wh=
o don't know what conclusions the other listeners have drawn. 

The idea of=
 a spirit distorting the facts must also be considered.  Not lying, per se,=
 but rather getting the facts within their reality confused. This is where =
you have the right to have the facts validated by the spirit.  Ask them to =
prove it to you.  They can tell you some corresponding items that back up t=
heir claims, direct you to old newspaper stories or to a person they used t=
o affiliate with or bring the validation into your focus (meaning the same =
thing comes into your life while you're driving/working/ at home/talking to=
 someone/reading and etc.) at least three times.  A spirit who is being tru=
thful will not mind trying to make this happen. 

Once these have been cons=
idered and eliminated, then we should be willing to entertain the idea the =
spirit may be a lower energy being (a bully/swindler/ con-man or woman/narc=
issist and etc) in their past life and this is the only way they know how t=
o achieve what they want.  And yes, those spirits do exist.  "As in life, s=
o in death", meaning our personalities don't change when our bodies die.

A=
l, maybe he wasn't trying to prove anything.  Is it possible the spirit voi=
ce didn't mean he WAS (typed larger for emphasis) Steve Tate, but rather wa=
nted to talk ABOUT Steve Tate or get a message TO Steve Tate?  Did he mean =
to say "Still fate"?  Could he have meant "paratrooper" ?  See where I'm go=
ing with this? 

And finally, in regards to the "end of the world stuff", i=
t has been taught to me by mediums and teachers who were all very honest an=
d excellent at what they do, and it has been relayed to me by spirits I've =
encountered in my mediumship service that we don't have a free glimpse of t=
he future once our bodies die and we move into spirit form.  I mean no offe=
nse and I'm not impying that wasn't what was heard.  That said (or rather '=
typed'), I'd be VERY hesitant to believe this communication.  There are bei=
ngs that are privvy to the potential (underscore "potential") future in our=
 lives, but it isn't their nature to join us for EVP sessions. 

I hope I h=
aven't taken liberty with this forum by posting such a long reply. I thank =
you for your time and attention. If you have other questions or would like =
me to clarify something, please ask.  I'd be honored to share what I know a=
nd track down what I don't.  :) 

Michelle
