a little bigger than 469 has a build it speaker like the 470... The 587 is =
new and is what they call an evaluation or marketing test unit, RS is testi=
ng them to see if they sell. If your store does no't have one in stock have=
 them check their computer (no the rs WEB site) to see if any other stories=
 in their district has one in and if they can get one for you.
