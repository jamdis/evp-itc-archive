Here's an interesting message I received last night, I was asking about  
confirmation of what David keeps telling me,,here's what I got. There are  
several people saying things, and me at the end repeating what I think I hear  
the guy before me saying.   You'll need to listen at least two times  to 
hear it, because of static, wish i could get my hands on one of those formal  
boxes, bet I could get some really good stuff, because they don't seem to 
carry  so much static. Now, why is that I wonder.  Maybe I can stop the static  
with this 20-125 some how. sf
