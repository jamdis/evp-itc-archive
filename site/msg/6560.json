If they ever want to\ncall me, they better be listed because I screen all my calls. \nSomething like Spirit Realm or Steve&#39;s Spirit on the caller i.d. is\nall I need.

Just letting you all know I have posted \n&gt; some new RS 12-469 files as MP3 files to save space. I hope you all \n&gt; enjoy them as some of these are very interesting. I doubt if any radio \n&gt; stations said any of what I posted on here from the RS Hack Box. You \n&gt; can tell me what your thoughts are on them if you like. Maybe some of \n&gt; you may understand what they are trying to say. Oh well you all take \n&gt; care for now and keep up the good work people. I do like the one that \n&gt; called me a &quot; Dumb shit &quot; LOL when I asked &quot; who are the Shadow \n&gt; People ? &quot; They are funny sometimes. You gotta love it. The RS 20-125 \n&gt; model seems to be alittle clearer with less clutter I think. Will post \n&gt; some of those when I get a chance. Happy Sweeping everyone !!!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Ralph the Ghost Hunter\n&gt;"}
