They then say DONT LEAVE YET. I even hear\nthem say HURRY! \nThere is some more back and forth while we try to get everyone back\nover. I must drive them crazy because on playback I hear done complete\nand here a bunch but eventually I here them and end the session.\nIts over at ESNIPS because the file is too large for here.\nCheck it out: \nhttp://www.esnips.com/doc/6a4f2cc7-749c-4758-b5e4-de25fbe1c4c4/DONT-LEAVE-YET-ONE-MORE-HURRY-DONE-COMPLETE-HERE\nI hope the link works.\nk"}
