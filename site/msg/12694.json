While using a faraday cage\nto to prevent spurious and unwanted RF signals from contaminating a\nmicrophone would be helpful for traditional evp, would it not be\ncounterproductive for box type ITC/RTSC? I am not trying to be\nsarcastic or anything, I am just wondering if the idea here is to\nensure that if anything did make it through that it would most likely\nbe genuine? I would be afraid that the RF shielding would be too\neffective thus blocking communication with a linear sweep box. If you\ndid get communication from a box in a faraday cage, it would certainly\nmake the skeptics and cynics be forced to present new arguments.\n\nthanks,\nAndy\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot;\n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; While reading a book about spirit communication, there was a chapter \n&gt; which referenced the Faraday Cage.  So... after reading it I decided to \n&gt; try out what the book suggested and placed my Radio Shack Hack 12-470 \n&gt; Ghost Box into my microwave oven (in the OFF position) and ran a sweep \n&gt; in the AM and FM mode.\n&gt; The AM mode did receive much less but a few audio snippets did make \n&gt; their way through.  The FM mode was a different story. No frequencies \n&gt; at all made it through... just white noise as each FM frequency was \n&gt; reached during the sweep.\n&gt; As I always do... I made a short video of both modes being sweeped.\n&gt; You can see it, here:\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQwYmi70-qw\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; - Mike (UFO Geek)\n&gt;"}
