It will not hurt\nthings.  I generally just announce I am beginning a recording session\nand then say I am ending it prior to shutting down.  I believe spirit\nunderstands your intentions so no ceremony is needed.  It is more a\nmatter of having spirits around at the moment that have the\nenergy/inclination to communicate.  The only drawback to using the\ncandle is becoming accustomed to it and then going somewhere where you\ncan&#39;t use it when you collect EVP&#39;s. \n\nAllen\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;earthangel5998&quot; &lt;harris5998@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Also...\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there any way to &quot;prepare&quot; for recording like light a candle, \n&gt; meditate, etc? I am thinking maybe when I start sessions I can light a \n&gt; candle and when I end them I can blow the candle out kind of like a \n&gt; signal.\n&gt; \n&gt; My grandfather-in-law and my father-in-law have both passed, should I \n&gt; try and ask for them by name or should I ask for anyone available? \n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry for the questions, I&#39;ve never done this before! \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks! \n&gt; Angela\n&gt;"}
