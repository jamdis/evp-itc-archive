I&#x27;ve noticed something in responses that seem to be coming through in 
Oscar&#x27;s own voice (as opposed to the messages that are clearly formed 
with snippets from the airwaves).  Over the usual clicking you get on AM 
on the RS 469, I frequently get a loud click at what seems to be a 
consistent time interval of almost 2 seconds before I get a response.  
Is this fairly common?  And what&#x27;s causing that?  Does he need to draw 
energy from the RS469 before he can respond?

Speaking of which, are there technical terms for recordings in the 
spirit&#x27;s own voice and for ones formed from bits of voices on the airwaves?

I warned you that I had a lot of questions.  =)

Thanks!

Nellie
