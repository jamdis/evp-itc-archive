<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce.  Just a thought.... It&#x27;s really sweet of you to make yourself so available to people, 
but if you have members take inquiries of this nature off the boards by having them 
contact your privately, you are limiting the amount of learning that can take place.  There 
are likely &quot;lurkers&quot; here, who will never join or come forward, but could really benefit from 
Lyn&#x27;s questions and the answers she receives from the group.  

Taking communication privately also eliminates the possibility for her to receive multiple 
opinions.  (not to imply there isn&#x27;t a time for privacy!)  ;0)

Like I said, just a thought.  

Margaret

members here. trying to learn from everyone.&gt; I have activity in my home. so I purchased 
an RCA digital recorder&gt; which is amazing.&gt; I have captured several EVPs, some quite 
clear, some a bit too fast&gt; so I slow it down to hear it. some are voices , some answer 
questions, some &gt; are just noises.&gt; &gt; does anyone have experience with EVPs on digital 
recorders ?&gt; I have a ton of questions... and need advice on some of them.&gt; &gt; thanks&gt;
