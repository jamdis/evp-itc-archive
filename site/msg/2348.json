This is different from the meditation type of \nOBE \n&gt; and is often referred to as an SOBE - or &quot;spontaneous out of body \n&gt; experience.&quot;  I believe this is what you are describing.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The following link has an interesting article: \n&gt; http://www.astraldynamics.com/tutorials/?BoardID=111&BulletinID=472\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; LC\n&gt; Angels & Ghosts\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just kicking around some thoughts in my head, and nobody is up \n&gt; tonight to share thier ideas so I am writing it down anyway while \n&gt; it&#39;s fresh in my thoughts. \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   I know and understand pretty well about OOB&#39;s and have read \n&gt; peoples experiences. So far all of my disembodied experiences were \n&gt; while I was &quot;unconcious&quot; with little to verify any of the \n&gt; experiences as being anything but a dream state. However lately I \n&gt; have begun to do something again that I havent done since I was a \n&gt; small child. \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   You know how it is when you wake up in the morning hit the \n&gt; snooze button, roll over and lay there thinking..... man I dont \nwant \n&gt; to get up right now I am soooo comfortable. Well lets just say I \ndo \n&gt; that alot even tho I usually get up before the next alarm hits in \na \n&gt; few minutes I still press it, roll over and lay there for a minute \n&gt; LOL. Some people hit the coffee machine.. i hit the snooze.\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   However, lately I am rolling over, but the body seems to stay \n&gt; still turned the other way. I used to do it often when I was a kid \nI \n&gt; would wake up in a totally different position than I thought I was \n&gt; laying in when I had my eyes closed. I&#39;d think I was layin on my \n&gt; stomache and realize I was flat on my back or on my side. With \n&gt; gravity its pretty easy to feel which end is facing down and once \nI \n&gt; am fully alert its a little disorientating at first. I am curious \nif \n&gt; anybody else has that experience, including those who travel out \nof \n&gt; body at will.\n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;   Misty\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Luggage?
