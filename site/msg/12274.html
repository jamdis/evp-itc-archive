<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>LOL!! I find thats what the skeptics say about ALL methods of ITC. Even funnier when they get results and are addressed by thier full names it tends to rock the boat they sit in. As usual I only speak from my own research over the years, my own experiences, results and opinions and suggest people try it themselves =) Good luck!

row row row your boat...

&gt; Are you talking about the computer program EVP Maker from
&gt; Germany?  All it does is jumble whatever come through the
&gt; mike, there is no way to be sure you actually get anything. 
&gt; Unless you know something that I don&#x27;t about it.
&gt; 
&gt; Take care,

&gt; Yes and successfully! EVPmaker, , water, chainsaw, sweep
&gt; tuning, you name it LOL. I even have had a bit of live
&gt; interaction while setting it up with thier suggested
&gt; settings. I have a few posted over on my esnips along with
&gt; other methods. Just look at list on left and click
&gt; &quot;more folders&quot; to see the rest of the list of diff
&gt; methods. Its in there.

&gt; &gt; Has anyone tried the program EVP Maker ?
&gt; &gt; http://www.stefanbi on.de/evpmaker/ index_e.htm
&gt; &gt; I was thinking about using it with my other equipment
&gt; for a
&gt; &gt; continuing 
&gt; &gt; investigation of an old house.
