I&#39;m hoping my article did a good job of countering Alec&#39;s take on the radio \nsweep.  &quot;To Sweep or Not to Sweep&quot; was written by me.  :-)\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; just received the latest AA-EVP NewsJournal. Especially the radio sweep\n&gt; method and EVPmaker are discussed quite controversially in this issue.\n&gt; Alec MacRae for instance wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- begin quote ----\n&gt; Like EVPmaker, the swept receiver method is capable of producing EVP,\n&gt; but it is also even more capable of producing false results. Some years\n&gt; ago, I did a series of experiments with EVPmaker.... What EVPmaker does\n&gt; is take a few seconds of speech, chop it into little pieces called\n&gt; phonemes and then randomize these phonemes. If you are lucky, you will\n&gt; find EVP.\n&gt; \n&gt; What some people do, frustrated at not getting very much, is they make\n&gt; the slices wider, so then what you are getting are actually sizeable\n&gt; little chunks of the sentence. Actual words are still there. In that\n&gt; case you seem to be getting more EVP, but what you are getting is simply\n&gt; a rearranged sentence.\n&gt; ---- end quote ----\n&gt; \n&gt; My comment on this:\n&gt; \n&gt; If only phonemes are used, as is the case for the SpeakJet allophones\n&gt; file, this won&#39;t happen, since this source material definitely doesn&#39;t\n&gt; already contain speech. In order to rule out doubts as to getting &quot;false\n&gt; EVPs&quot;, only audio sources should be used in the future which aren&#39;t\n&gt; already finished speech. So perhaps using SJ allophones are one step\n&gt; towards the right direction. Interesting, that this comes up right now...\n&gt; \n&gt; Stefan\n&gt;"}
