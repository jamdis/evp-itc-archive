Just wondering if it is just me or am I \ndoing it all wrong? I bring a voice recorder that uses a standard \nrecording tape and can&#39;t hear anything unusual. Any suggestions on how \nI can try to get some voices would be great. I am open-minded to the \nspirit world and have seen spirits but not heard from them. Would like \nto try to capture some voices. Any suggestions would be great!\n\nThanks very much,\n\nJan"}
