Thanks fo=
r the clarification Mike. I would still warn that, even in 
your experiment=
 here, you yourself could become your own weak link in
objectivity. As Cher=
i pointed out, even someone with the best 
intentions, who truly wants to p=
rovide accurate & honest information,
is only human and subject to error. T=
his is especially true if they
have already decided which parts of their th=
eories are right or wrong,
without, again, objective testing. This is not a=
 phenomenon that only
effects the home experimenter, but experts in all fie=
lds, and they
have learned of methods over time (such as the double blind t=
esting I
mentioned) to help weed out weak processes and develop and explore=

their theories on the firmest foundations possible.

But I understand you =
are not trying to prove or test anything in this
case, or use them to claim=
 any kind of proof: you're just trying an
experiment. So, good luck with it=
.
