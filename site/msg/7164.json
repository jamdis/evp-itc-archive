One tip - if you are using a \nhand-held recorder, be careful to keep it far enough away from your box \nthat it doesn&#39;t cause interference itself.  I noticed a big difference \nin how staticy my recordings out in the field were over the weekend vs. \nthe ones I&#39;ve been recording directly into my computer.  I guess I ought \nto invest in an external mic for the hand-held.\n\n\nNellie\n\r\n--------------070002010206040805070805\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot; text=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;\nRalph Smith wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know why people can&#39;t hear\nmy voices I get with &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the boxes.
