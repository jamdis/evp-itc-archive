Holly Cow Bruce, your having a two way conversation with the other side.  Where do you go with this technology from here?  I have a question to ask the other side...who is the leader, the boss, the jefe...who is the top person or thing or whatever is in control of communications with spaceship earth?  I would really like to know...like, take me to your leader.  Maybe Sarah can give you a direct answer?   Ron L

I have been lucky enough to not only have Frank's box #12 but now Frank 
has gifted me with a brand new box #29.

Here are the first files to come out of it. And it has not even been 
imprinted by mike and lisa yet. These files are from the first 30 
seconds of the first session.

let me know what you think.

Bruce
