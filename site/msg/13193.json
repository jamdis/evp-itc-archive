To only receive comments that confirm a theory, and not\naccept any to the contrary, I think does a disservice to the research,\nand to the researcher.  It can mean repeating mistakes, or continuing\ndown an unfruitful path, rather than switching strategies when needed.\n That&#39;s how progress is made.  If Edison kept testing the first\nfilament he ever tried, and never tried new ones, we&#39;d probably still\nbe in the dark.  He tried an approach, rejected it, tried a new one,\nrejected it, and kept going, until he found one that worked, under\nobjective analysis, for everyone.\n\nI hope my comments do not come across as &#39;negative&#39;, in a bad way. \nThey are just what my own analysis indicates.  I think the best\napproach at analysis in this field is to invite many people from many\nfields, solicit all their input, and be ready to move forward, or\nchange tactics, depending on what that analysis suggests. \n\nAnd of course, my comment is just that: my comment.  Just one person&#39;s\ncomment. I am skeptical of claims made in which I cannot see or hear\nthe professed results, but am not denying anything outright, without\ndoing the best analysis and using the best judgment that I can muster.\n And again, I think that is what good research requires.  To only\naccept &#39;positive&#39; comments would remove this activity far from good\nresearch, and leave it, at best, more in the realm of a social club.\n\nSo I do intend to keep on as I have: reading, learning, analyzing, and\nhopefully giving posts that add, one way or the other, to the accuracy\nand progress of the discussion.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, suzanne bibb &lt;suzyq6819@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; You definately got something there . . . great job!� I think before\nanyone else makes any negative comments they need to be aware of how\nthe boxes work . . .
