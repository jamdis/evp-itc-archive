Frank must be a\ntrue celebrity over there. Most impressive!\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; During a skype session on Friday, myself, Joel and Steve got some\n&gt; great files! The strenght of the audio regarding our own Frank\n&gt; Sumption was truly amazing. This is the best part of the communication\n&gt; and makes me proud to me apart of all of this.\n   \n&gt;   If its one thing for sure, they certainly love and know Frank!\n   \n&gt;   Enjoy!\n&gt;   Juli"}
