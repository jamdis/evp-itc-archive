<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>HI, 
EDWARDS

NO I AM A HEALTHY SKEPTIC, AND I DO PLAY WITH EVPmaker.

I WANT TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE BOX, MAYBE YOU WOULD BE SO KIND TO SEND
ME ONE? MY ADDRESS IS 

NATHAN SHARMAN
P.O. BOX 1022, 
BELLAIRE, TX 77402.

IF YOU WANT TO CHARGE ME FOR THE EXPENSE, KINDLY LET ME KNOW THE PRICE
AND I WILL LET YOU KNOW IF I CAN AFFORD IT.

I REALLY WANT TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE BOX.

NOW DOES EVERY ONE WHO USES A BOX GET A RESPONSE?

BY THE WAY I DO INTEND TO SERIOUS RESEARCH ON THIS WHEN I HAVE THE
MONEY TO DO IT FULL TIME.

&gt;    
&gt;   I never thought a skeptic would join our group.  Oh well. I agree
with you. Thanks

&gt;                There are always going to be skeptics where we go. 
As long as we say true to ourselves as well as our data, that is all
that matters.  I have come to understand within the past 8 years that
I have nothing to prove to anyone, but myself.  We have all come to
EVP-ITC communication for various reason, and I need no one to prove
to me life after death is there.
&gt;    
&gt;                When people throw the box at me, I usually have a
great response, but its comes a time that I just say, don&#x27;t knock it
till you try it and ignore their rambling given their difference in
beliefs.
&gt; 
&gt;                 See, if you look at it that we are the blessed ones
who in fact do have the ability to receive two way communication on a
greater level, than I am the one that is grateful for being able to
open my mind and accept it.
&gt;    
&gt;   Just my thoughts!

&gt;         Nathan, I am amazed you would suggest or even think that!  I
live in Cary, North Carolina and record when I have the time. There is
no set schedule, and when I turn my radio on and someone says hello
Michael, or even shouts out &quot;Mike Edwards&quot;, or a spirit tells me I am
holding a carving in my hand, who would even know I turned the radio
on? Only my wife knows I record, and we have kept this research from
our children as well as our neighbors. So you are suggesting that
Margaret, lets say who lives where I do not know, is playing a joke on
me with a high tech two way radio?

&gt;       Hi Nathan. I always look to relevance as a key in determining
whether or not something is 
&gt; appropriate to the session. If this were a hoax, I would then have
to seek an explanation 
&gt; for how private information is known by the &#x27;hoax perp&#x27;,
particularly information that 
&gt; would require visual awareness. 
&gt; 
&gt; Some of us have examples of appropriate responses being given when
asking things like, 
&gt; &quot;Can you name something nearby me?&quot; or &quot;Please tell me what I&#x27;m
holding in my left 
&gt; hand.&quot; A sophisticated multi-transmission two way radio would not
explain answers 
&gt; which require &#x27;visual&#x27; information of some kind (though I&#x27;ll be the
first to admit my 
&gt; understanding of electronics is limited but I&#x27;m fairly confident on
this aspect.) 
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, there is always the chance that the person running the
hoax is also, or in 
&gt; partnership with, an extremely talented remote viewer or psychic who
is able to glean that 
&gt; visual information from the ether or the mind of the experimenter. 
&gt; 
&gt; And what of those examples where people have confirmed the sound of
the voice being 
&gt; &quot;just like&quot; that of their loved one in spirit? Surely the hoaxer
isn&#x27;t also able to mimic 
&gt; people&#x27;s loved ones.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are using EVP Maker with anything other than the allophones
file, which contains no 
&gt; words to begin with, you are also running the possibility of &#x27;false
positives&#x27; albeit they 
&gt; wouldn&#x27;t be from a hoax. Again, I look to relevance to be key, and
relevant info that 
&gt; would not come easily to a stranger is even better. 
&gt; 
&gt; For example, I turned on my MiniBox for the very first time and
said, &quot;Hello?&quot; and 
&gt; immediately received the response, &quot;Hello Margaret.&quot; If this were a
hoax, how could that 
&gt; person know in less than 10 seconds, who I was by name. I had not
given this information 
&gt; out. Not to mention that you have people experimenting 24/7 and
receiving similar 
&gt; responses. How in the world could an organization have the manpower,
technology, or 
&gt; even the desire, to attempt such a hoax? I mean that as a genuine
inquiry, because there 
&gt; might be an explanation I have not thought of. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have one example where, via radio sweep, my communicator was able
to correctly 
&gt; identify the status and location of a missing person (who it turns
out was alive and well, so 
&gt; we ended up with confirmation that the info given had indeed been
correct - which is 
&gt; much less complicated that trying to track and understand the clues
when associated with 
&gt; the dead, or missing but not found.) Again, if a hoax, would that
have simply been a 
&gt; lucky guess on the part of the hoaxer?
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line for me is ... have I wondered if it could be a hoax? Or
simply a fortuitous 
&gt; tuning of the dial? Yes, on both accounts. But there is enough
compelling evidence to rule 
&gt; out both of them as an explanation for the far too many relevant
examples received by so 
&gt; many of us.
&gt; 
&gt; Good food for thought, but after digesting it, I&#x27;d have to say, &quot;No,
a sophisticated hoax 
&gt; does not sufficiently explain the phenomena on a large scale.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Has it ever occurred to you, that some one or

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This whole radio and spirit voices, could be a MASSIVE
&gt; &gt; HOAX, perpetuated by some one with a sophisticated
&gt; &gt; multi-transmission two way radio.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Think about it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THAT IS WHY I USE EVPmaker only to commuincate with
&gt; &gt; the other dimension.
