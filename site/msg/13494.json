We did a session for about an hour and a half and the last twenty minutes was drawing in negative stuff.  We had to shut down the session because it kept saying &#39;shut up&#39; and &#39;f-you&#39; and other negative things like that.  \n\nOther than that, as Margaret mentioned, it&#39;s a great tool...we got some terrific results with it.\n\n-Dan"}
