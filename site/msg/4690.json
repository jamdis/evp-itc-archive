OUCH!  The pc board is now \ndamaged.\n\nI can&#39;t quite tell how bad it is from the photo.  It might be repairable \nbut probably not with the original connector.  That would have to be \nremoved and the wires soldered directly to the board. The board itself \nwould have to be repaired also, by someone who has experience in repairing \nsuch things.\n\nI could probably do that, as I worked in electronics repair for over 10 \nyears, but I live quite a ways from you.\n\nZack\n\nOn Mon, 31 Dec 2007, Debbie Tejada wrote:\n\n&gt; Okay, one of my DIY projects this weekend has been to convert my\n&gt; husband&#39;s old Olympus to infrared. We&#39;re not extremely talented in the\n&gt; electronics area, but we have fun and seem to muddle by. No guts no\n&gt; glory, huh?\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, for the most part the operation has been a success. I\n&gt; photographed every step of the way and taped screws and parts to the\n&gt; photos so we&#39;d know how to rebuild everything we took apart, and that\n&gt; has worked just fine. I located the IR filter, removed it and cut and\n&gt; replaced it with a piece of glass slide.\n&gt;\n&gt; The one problem we ran into is that there were two wires that appeared\n&gt; to be clipped in place as opposed to being soldered or screwed in like\n&gt; everything else. When we tried to pry the clips open, instead the\n&gt; whole thing came off the circuit board. WE HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO PROCEED\n&gt; FROM HERE. I don&#39;t know if we can just glue the darn things down and\n&gt; if so, what type of glue to use, or if we&#39;re just plain up the creek.\n&gt;\n&gt; I immediately thought of this group of brainy electronics buffs. I&#39;m\n&gt; hoping someone out there can give us some advice, or if you live near\n&gt; Highlands Ranch, CO, you could help in person & bail us out of this. I\n&gt; was hoping to take this camera to the St. Augustine Lighthouse at the\n&gt; end of this coming week.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any hope? I&#39;ve posted a photo of an extreme closeup of the\n&gt; clips (one is pink, the other is ivory) and the damaged board -- I had\n&gt; to sandwich two photos together to get both in focus at the same time\n&gt; (that&#39;s why it looks that way). For an idea of scale, the clips are\n&gt; both the same size, about 4 mm in width, 4 mm tall, 3 mm deep. Not\n&gt; easy to handle and even harder to see with these middle age eyes.\n&gt; http://www.tejadadesign.com/camera/splice.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt; Any advice would be GREATLY APPRECIATED!!  Deb T.\n&gt;"}
