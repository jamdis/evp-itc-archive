<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ll ask some local ghost hunters I know if they&#x27;d be interested and
pass along your email addy. If you get great responses then why sell
it? I know they&#x27;re gonna ask. haha I&#x27;d keep the toys that work well.
I&#x27;m sure the editing did cut out some waiting around etc., and I
haven&#x27;t read Ryan&#x27;s blog about the episode yet. He will usually say
something about it there if the editing is done to make something seem
more than what it was and I&#x27;ve seen him express concern about
production things there before, so I think he&#x27;ll mention it if the
footage was heavily edited.

&gt; Hi Elabeth,
&gt;
&gt; You have to remember much of what the Ovilus 1 said probably ended up on the
&gt; editing room floor.  But it does work.  I get great responses from mine.
&gt; The (7) different modes on it work very well.  But if you know anyone who
&gt; wants one please let me know.  I was informed I have to sell some of my toys
&gt; to afford to buy new toys...LOLOL  I would sell it for $165.00 and it is in
&gt; brand new condition and only used a few times.

&gt; I thought it was pretty neat that it repeated the word &quot;worry&quot; when
&gt; Ryan asked if it was worried they&#x27;d bring in a priest.
&gt; What are the odds of that just based on environmental readings? If I
&gt; had an extra $200 laying around I&#x27;d be buying myself one to play with.

&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know how many of the members watch Paranormal State, but they used
&gt;&gt; a new piece of equipment called The Ovilus. You guys have got to check
&gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt; out. Go to www.digitaldowsing.com. I am not really sure who these guys
&gt;&gt; are,
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; where they came up with this. To me, it sounds kind of like Frank&#x27;s Box,
&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt; not the same.
&gt;&gt; Frank, please take a look at this, and tell us what you think.
&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t understand how it works......
