<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Not really new to the group, been lurking for a few months just 
reading, listening, and studying.

Unfortunately I&#x27;m not much of an engineer so I&#x27;ve been picking up 
books to help me better understand the technical side of the boxes.  
I understand the practicality of them (ie- creating random white 
noise to allow EVPs to be formed) but I hope to gain an understanding 
of how they work technically in hopes of building and tweaking my own.

For me EVP has been something I&#x27;ve been into all my life without 
knowing what it was (I&#x27;m 30 now, I first learned the technical term 
about 22 or 23) - I guess I&#x27;m what people would call &quot;sensitive&quot; or 
whatever.  But besides that, early on I was fascinated by seemingly 
coherant sounds that would come out of random noise on my clock radio 
in my bedroom as a kid, from what sounded like voices (thought I was 
crazy for a while) to even morse code - for a long time one of my 
radios would produce random clicks or pops even when the speaker was 
off.  My dad jokingly suggested it was morse code, so I studied morse 
code and discovered that at least some of it could be morse 
letters...usually they would spell one word and then gibberish.

Anyways, once I learned what EVP was I began messing around with 
recorders etc.  My first clear recording came from using EVP maker 
and was someone saying &quot;we have been waiting for you.&quot;  A few days 
later, after a frustrating lack of communication they just told 
me &quot;build a box.(this happened to be after I learned of frank.)&quot;  
I&#x27;ve been looking at all the boxes and their positives and negatives 
and this is what I&#x27;m seeing:

Franks models seem to produce the most consistant results but also 
seem to be less two way than some others (ie Joe&#x27;s Box.)  Joe&#x27;s Box 
and the new radio shack mod seem to have some very clear voices 
coming through but skeptics can argue that all you are hearing is 
snippets from radio broadcasts.

My thought for a cost-effective, low-tech alternative is to combine 
the two in that you create a radio shack mod like the UFOGeek one 
(multiple radios, a mixer, etc) and run it through an echo box.

Personally I believe that analog is giving the best results overall, 
and I think it has to do with ease of manipulating the signal.  
Therefore my thought is taking a digital white noise signal like that 
produced by the radio shack mods and then essentially broadcasting it 
into the echo chamber and having a mic pick it up gives you the 
analog aspect.

My question is has anyone tried this?  And I was hoping for thoughts 
on the pros and cons of using AM vs. FM or both.

Oh, one other thing- any programmers/engineers out there?  Someone 
that could write code to allow us to randomly band scan a digital 
radio?</pre>
