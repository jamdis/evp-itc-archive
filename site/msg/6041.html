<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I know some investigators that try to record the animals sleeping in
houses that have reported paranormal activity. They claim sleeping
dogs and cats are used by spirits to communicate with us if we just
listen. Bill

&gt;  I have gotten our dead dogs on EVP, or through the box, but today, as 
&gt; my wife an I were both downstairs, we didn&#x27;t hear the doorbell  as the 
&gt; neighbor kid was ringing it, so being about 7, he just came on in.  The 
&gt; smallest Yorkie let out a loud bark, and I swear it said &quot;get outta 
&gt; here&quot;. I heard it as plan as any other speech.  
&gt; 
&gt;  I know, anecdotal evidence.
