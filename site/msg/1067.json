Using the switch simplifies the chargers circuit, so I don&#39;t \nneed plus and minus charger supplies, all three charge regulators being run \nfrom a single transformer and DC supply. The switch being out of the &quot;junk \nbox&quot;, so cost-less. I seem to have collected exactly what I needed over the \nyears, and I always seem to have exactly what I need. Number 21 has a \nsimilar switch.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMortgage refinance is Hot. *Terms. Get a 5.375%* fix rate.
