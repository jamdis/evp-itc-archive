We could hear it in\n&gt; person at the time, and it sounded like &quot;get out.&quot; Once I pulled it\n&gt; into Audacity, it sounded completely different. Slowing it down 33%\n&gt; makes it sound even more different. Any guesses? I haven&#39;t done\n&gt; anything to these files other than to slow the second version down a\n&gt; bit.
