Hi, gang!

Well, aren't we the animated group! <G>

Please, please, PLEASE! Do NOT just hit reply and type a brief answer,
leaving the copies upon copies upon copies of previous emails in your reply
below your new comment!

For those of us who get the posts in digest form (a group of posts grouped
into a long list in one email), it becomes impossible to follow the
discussions and posts when some of the entire threads (posts and numerous
replies) get repeated multiple times with every reply!

Please snip the texts and leave only the parts to which you are replying.

I would be extremely appreciative and grateful for everyone's attention to
this little detail of internet/groups etiquette.

And on another note, my own experience with channeling and doing mediumship
work (without recorders) is that the more relaxed you are, and the more
clear about your inter-dimensional boundaries, the better the communications
will be. If you wouldn't put up with threats or harassment in the ordinary
five-senses world, why on earth should we put up with it from discarnate
beings? I think they need to respect us for being willing to be the vehicles
through which they communicate, just as we need to be respectful of them for
*wanting* and *trying* to communicate.

And I don't think the entities are snatching words from the radio scans, I
think the generation of white-noise soundwaves creates a conducive
electromagnetic environment with which (maybe) they can vibrate more easily.
The theory is (and who really knows, after all?), that they are themselves
electromagnetic energy, not third-dimension physical beings, and so vibrate
at the higher frequencies that sound does...

I don't know if that explanation makes sense the way I wrote it, but that's
what I've heard discussed by other, way more expert mediums than I (I mostly
do channeling and other psychic work, only occasionally mediumship).

Best,

Leslie
