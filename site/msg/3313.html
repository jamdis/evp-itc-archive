<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just because a researcher talks about the box research on a radio show 
doesnt make them any less a researcher, the Box is already out there 
in the paranormal world, dont you think it best that the information 
given to the media should come from professional researchers, getting 
the facts out there is surely more important.  Dont forget most of 
theses paranormal radio shows are there because of their love of 
paranormal research and investigating, you really come across as a kid 
with a new toy that dont want anyone else to play with, this research 
is no longer part of a secret club the water is already over the rim 
of the glass, let people know the facts before some fly by night gets 
taken for his word... Rant over!!</pre>
