Yeah, what IS that about anyway?  You create the boxes but get no help usin=
g them.   I wonder about the usefulness of the information as well, and the=
 fact that something talks that shouldn't be there is what intrigues me too=
.  The multiple-level theory makes absolute sense.  I would like to believe=
 we're communicating with angels rather than devils, but that's obviously n=
ot the case, at least not always.  Personally, I want this to be proof of l=
ife after death rather than proof of extraterrestrials or nature spirits or=
 demons, and the fact that I may never know might drive me crazy eventually=

  I have noticed a disturbing trend of box u=

coincide with 
  these supposed technicains. You would think, since I make =
the boxes I 
  would get some assistence from the supopsoed technicains, bu=
t there 
  is none! 

  I do not know who or what communicates. I am unwill=
ing to jump on 
  the higher spirit band wagon, as they seemly produce noth=
ing useful, 
  very little verifiable information, nothing that makes life =
better, 
  nothing that helps me make better boxes. I know only that someth=
ing 
  talks that shouldn't be there, and that keeps me intrigued. As Sun 
=
  Bear used to say, "They don't grow any corn".

  I have a "group" that in=
sists I am their Space Princess, now how 
  wise is it to just accept what =
they say, without question, being that 
  I am niether female, nor Royalty!=


  Curious that I make the boxes, but my input about it's use is so 
  eas=
ily dismissed.

  There is at the very least, multiple levels that can be c=
ontacted, 
  some very manipulative, perhaps demonic if you want to go down=
 that 
  road. If you want them to tell you how great you are, they will 
 =
 certainly do so, that is why the caution.
