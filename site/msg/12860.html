<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ole&#x27; &quot;Dr&quot; Dave, lol hadn&#x27;t heard from him in a long while. He does
have longevity in the field, but his tendency to boast about his
supposed accolades and merits regarding the authenticity of his orb
photos, coupled with his self-glorifying tendency to proclaim himself
the king of all paranormal investigation has pretty much relegated him
to eventual obscurity. Back in the early days (1999 I think) I
submitted my flegling group&#x27;s website to IGHS associate member
program, yet Mr. Oester declined saying that my website containing a
black background was too hard on his eyes and no one would take my
site seriously for the same reason. 

Enter the popularity of TAPS and the highly visible &quot;war of blogs&quot;
that followed regarding their credibility in his eyes and folks were
witness to Oester&#x27;s online self-destruction. He still pops up from
time to time and despite my efforts still sends me his newsletter
telling me where and when IGHS RV is going to be et cetera. I hate to
see that he is charging for the information regarding the freely
available shack hack, no doubt an attempt on his part to reinvent
himself and seek legitimacy in the field. This doesn&#x27;t surprise me,
however, seeing as how in the past he would charge for special
membership to areas of his website where he showcased FREELY submitted
photos and evp from folks across the country.

&gt; It was brought to my attention that a guy named Dave Oester is selling 
&gt; an ebook on how to modify the Radio Shack 12-469, something he calls 
&gt; the &#x27;Digcom&#x27;. (Isn&#x27;t it just the Radio Shack Hack?)
&gt; Has anyone purchased this book? Has anyone had dealings with this Dave 
&gt; Oester?  I guess he produces other types of ebooks too.
&gt; 
&gt; There is so much FREE information out there on how to modify the 12-
&gt; 469, I wonder if his book is actually selling...
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
