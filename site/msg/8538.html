Well I went yesterday after work and picked up a RS12-469. Did the hack this afternoon surprising simple!! So if anyone can please help me with what else I need to get started I would appreciate it.  I do have some PC speakers and a small microphone to use. Not sure how to set it up.
   
  Thanks

            For me it was the 12-469, It has worked well with me.  I did buy a 20-125, and hacked it correctly, and I didn't like it.  I also didn't get very much reception.  The 20-125 has a long anntena, and the 12-469 you can hold it in your hand, and you act as the anntena.  That way you get better reception.  Only problem with the 12-469 is that it clicks a little, but I can't hear it anymore.  I train not to hear it.

        I am looking at getting either the 12-469 or 20-125. Which would be the best to get for someone who is just starting out. I will be doing the Hack myself with a little help and instructions. I want to get something fairly easy to hack and use for a beginner.
  Thanks

        Radio Shack 12-469, 20-125 then you would have to modifiy it.  Some peps here can tell you how to do it, or you can go to ufogeek.com, and watch a video on how to do it.
