Thank you, again.

Jay wondered if it was something with a lack of co=
nsciousness or simply unaware of us. We will give your suggestions a try. A=
nd yes, I've had literal entities refuse to leave. 
=C2=A0
I hope you have =
a blessed day!

Take every chance you get because some things only h=

Your welcome :)

Poltergeist phenomena could also explain why it gets quieter after ritual,=
 especially if the person from which the energy is stemming is involved in =
the ritual. The ritual lets the person release this energy in a constructiv=
e manner. After a while though, it builds back up.

Also, people have repor=
ted seeing glimpses of apparitions even in poltergeist cases. So it is some=
thing for you to consider. That Jay sees the apparition could mean that the=
 energy is coming from him.

The good news is that if it is PK energy, it s=
hould go away eventually. Since it seems to relax after ritual, you may try=
 some experiments with that. Have Jay do some personal ritual work and see =
if the phenomena subsides. If it doesn't subside, then do some personal rit=
ual yourself and see what happens. Just see if you can effect or find some =
patten to it. If you are able to establish that it does consistently respon=
d to ritual work by either of you, then that may be your answer. You just n=
eed to do some kind of regular ritual work to release the energy constructi=
vely.

Even if it is an actual entity, since ritual does seem to affect it,=
 this may still be your answer-maybe you can make a ritual around communica=
ting with it.

If it is an actual being, unfortunately there just is no sur=
e fire method to make them leave. I am sure you have run into this before i=
n your work as a medium - you can ask them to leave, but it's just like ask=
ing a living person to leave. If they don't want to go, they won't.

My sug=
gestion in this case would be to keep trying to communicate with it. Eventu=
ally hopefully you will get through to it.

Have you considered that it may just be energy, and not a sentient=
 being?

It sounds like a typical poltergeist case.

I am A=

Here =
is the issue. Our home has an inhabitant that we cannot seem to remove. It =
does not speak to us on the frank's box nor will it communicate through eit=
her me or my partner, Jay. We are both mediums. It slams and bangs in the h=
ouse almost ceaselessly at night. It hits the walls, windows, the tv, the b=
edside tables and the doors. I am at a loss as to how to otherwise communic=
ate because as I said with the 2 boxes we have, it won't speak.

I am open =
to any and all suggestions. We have told it to go, tried many different sug=
gested rituals and to no avail. It will go quiet for a day to three days af=
ter ritual work but begins again, only louder.

Please, if anyone can help =
or direct us to someone who can I would be most grateful.

Sincerely,
Annie=
 & Jay C.
