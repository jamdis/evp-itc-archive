&gt; Hey Snowfire,
&gt; As my life has been filled with many tragedies, I can tell you that I knew
&gt; a Justin who commited suicide. But Justin is a popular name. As I think
&gt; there were two I knew with that name. They both went out that way. One I
&gt; didn&#x27;t know well.
&gt; Usually when they are stuck here there is a reason, often personal. Like
&gt; unfinished business or guilt and such. Sounds like he needs help crossing
&gt; over as many earthbound spirits do. But, in my experience, there are many
&gt; types of spiritual encounters. Some come to visit and help.
&gt; I just had to reply. This stuff is certainly different. Stressful sometimes
&gt; too.
&gt; signed,
&gt; I forgot my name for this group. Never a dull day. Might like a day where
&gt; nothing weird happened.
