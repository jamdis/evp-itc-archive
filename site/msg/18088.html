It's not really a game: there are no winners or losers.
It's just so we can=
 experiment, try new methods, and see what works, and learn.
I enjoyed your=
 help in the last experiment, and I hope you will continue to contribute!

On Friday, 7/16/2010 I placed an object on

     asks for participants to determine what that object is. Vague or

        partial answers won't be counted (for example, just giving a color,=

            Answers anyone reveals after noon Monday won't count. P=
articipants

            chose. At the end of the experiment, I will re=
veal the object, and a 
            tally of the number of correct and/or i=
ncorrect answers.

In 
            order to keep me honest, I have taken a =
picture of the object at the 
            start of the experiment and loade=
d it to the Files section (RJ 
            folder) of this group. The idea =
with this file is that you can 
            download it now and 'keep it sa=
fe' on your computer. Then at the end 
            of the experiment, I wil=
l post the password so you can reveal the 
            contents of the file=
. That way, you were in control of the original

And if you do no=
t 
            care to download the zip file now, I will post the final ima=
ge there 
            at the end of the experiment anyway.

My monitor is o=

Multiscan 200sf" 
            on the upper front. I have a couple monitors =

            too: they are not the monitors used in th=
