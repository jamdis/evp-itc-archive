&gt; Yes sound can be a carrier as well as the silence. People
&gt; have recorded evp using a variety of methods and tools and
&gt; conditions. I&#x27;ve even had an instance that chainsaw
&gt; noise was being used and I was able to record some of the
&gt; speech.
&gt; Musical instruments such as guitar and piano tones have
&gt; also yeilded some results. Ive posted some in the files
&gt; section here of a few methods and alot on esnips. Links are
&gt; to the left.

&gt; &gt; Hi Misty
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You&#x27;re the only person I&#x27;ve heard mention
&gt; this, and
&gt; &gt; it makes me feel better knowing I&#x27;m not crazy (at
&gt; keast
&gt; &gt; totally). lol Long ago I noticed that running tap
&gt; water
&gt; &gt; sometimes seems to sound like garbled speech. I never
&gt; &gt; tested this with a recorder, but I&#x27;ve caught some
&gt; evps
&gt; &gt; with refrigerator motors and other devices. Audacity
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; the &quot;add white noise&quot; option, which allows
&gt; you to
&gt; &gt; record directly to your computer and allow the
&gt; entities to
&gt; &gt; organize the generic white noise. I&#x27;m eager to try
&gt; &gt; that. An excellent observation you had, Misty. I think
&gt; they
&gt; &gt; must grab hold of any babbling or whirring noise
&gt; available
&gt; &gt; to communicate, whether we&#x27;re able to pick it up
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; not. That&#x27;s why I carry around one of the
&gt; lightweight
&gt; &gt; Olympus recorders -- no telling where you&#x27;re going
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; find a babbling-brook or steady motor sound. Good ear!

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sweep tuning can be used on AM FM shortwave etc. I
&gt; have had
&gt; &gt; some 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; success without tuning just allowing them to use the
&gt; static
&gt; &gt; or water 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; noise thats in background. Best advice one cold give
&gt; is try
&gt; &gt; it 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; yourself for a while and see what you come up with =)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Why do you need to &quot;sweep&quot; the AM
&gt; spectrum? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone tried this but without sweeps on the
&gt; &gt; shortwave band? Has 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; any research been done? Could it be that the AM band
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; some sort 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; of &quot;special properties&quot; that would allow
&gt; such
&gt; &gt; communication? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why is it that the AM band has to be used with a
&gt; radio
&gt; &gt; station 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; playing? There are parts of the spectrum that is just
&gt; &gt; outside of that 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; spectrum that might provide a better form of
&gt; communication.
