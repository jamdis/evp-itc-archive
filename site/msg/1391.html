<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Welcome Zack, look forward to your take on the box and other ideas 
given your engineering background.  Read past posts to get an idea of 
what the group is about, i did and learned a lot of information about 
this whole topic.

Listen to the Uploaded Mp3 files in the FILES section and let us know 
what you think of them.  I&#x27;m in there under Simple FM Sweep radio 
design and would like to get some feedback.  I got some, but would 
like more.  My radio is a slightly different design than frank&#x27;s and 
want to know what people think.

Thanx,
-Steve H.

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I just joined and I thought I&#x27;d introduce myself.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am an electrical engineer, radio amateur and a ghost hunter 
&gt; living in 
&gt; &gt; Urbana, IL. (Well, I like the term &quot;paranormal investigator&quot; 
&gt; better!)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of EVP&#x27;s on a pocket DVR but I found and 
&gt; downloaded the 
&gt; &gt; schematics for Frank&#x27;s ghost box some months ago.  I&#x27;m fascinated 
&gt; by this 
&gt; &gt; idea and I hope I can find the time to build the equipmeont some 
&gt; time 
&gt; &gt; soon. Hopefully I will get beyond the 70-80 hour work weeks I&#x27;ve 
&gt; been 
&gt; &gt; putting in for the last couple months ...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Looking forward to seeing what&#x27;s happening on this group!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Zack
