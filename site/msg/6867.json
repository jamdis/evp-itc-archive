My=\r\n selfish motive in wanting to contact the other side is my hope to hear fro=\r\nm loved ones who have passed.  I couldn&#39;t admit this a couple of years ago =\r\nbecause the idea of being contacted by my dead parents terrified me.  Now I=\r\n long for it.  I believe guardian angels have intervened on my behalf in th=\r\ne past and continue to watch over me.  I&#39;ve had mystic experiences during t=\r\nimes of crisis that make me know a spiritual world exists.  How wonderful i=\r\nt must be to hear their voices first hand!  I&#39;ll remind myself every day ne=\r\nver to take any of what happens for granted.\n\nRobin\n\n \n  ----- Original Mes=\r\nsage ----- \n  From: bruce halliday&lt;mailto:paranormalinvestigating@hotmail.c=\r\nom&gt; \n  To: evp-itc@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:evp-itc@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n  Sent:=\r\n Monday, February 04, 2008 6:58 AM\n  Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] Re: File from t=\r\nonight--Bruce\n\n\n  Robin,\n   \n  I very much appreciate your comments and con=\r\nfidence in me, but at the end of the day I&#39;m no different than anyone else.=\r\n\n  The only thing that may set me apart from some of the other researchers =\r\nhere is that I have a bit more experience and \n  being disabled allows me a=\r\n lot more time for research.

And also recently Ms. Sarah Estep who has made the transition and is b=\r\neginning to work now on the\n  spirit side to further the communication. Any=\r\n information I receive from the spirits I recognise to be friends is invalu=\r\nable.

Funny thing is, I recognize Mike and Lisa =\r\non your recordings too.  I&#39;m aware that they are acting as facilitators and=\r\n guardians, that they are consistent in their ability to use varied modes o=\r\nf communication, and that their contact appears to be purposeful, as compar=\r\ned to so much that seems to have no rhyme or reason.  \n\n    As a newbie I&#39;m=\r\n admittedly intimidated by and in awe of the results you more experienced r=\r\nesearchers are accomplishing.  What I find most awesome is that everyone ca=\r\nn have different methods, belief systems and opinions and come together in =\r\none forum to share and learn from one another.  I feel so lucky to have fou=\r\nnd you!  Bruce, your ability to hear and accurately repeat my one posted EV=\r\nP is the only validation I&#39;ve personally ever received that makes me know I=\r\n&#39;m involved in something real and life altering.  I&#39;m supposed to be here! =\r\n I think a big part of my education will continue to come from the knowledg=\r\ne and experience you all are willing to keep sharing.  It&#39;s also a fact tha=\r\nt each of us needs to find his/her own individual truth.  \n\n    I&#39;m still t=\r\nroubled by the possibility that we could be pawns in Someone Else&#39;s science=\r\n experiment.  I can sense Frank&#39;s cynicism related to the messages being me=\r\naningless and the messengers being untrustworthy.  In your own case, what i=\r\ns the goal?  Is the fact that you&#39;ve established communication and continue=\r\n to communicate enough?  Are we hoping to gain invaluable information from =\r\nour guides, or just to have the comfort of knowing they are there?  \n\n    T=\r\nhis is the week I&#39;ve promised myself to start doing sessions with the Radio=\r\n Shack hacks!  \n\n    Robin\n\n\n\n\n\n    hoogroups.com&lt;mailto:myself.@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com&gt; \n      Sent: Sunday, February 03, 2008 6:25 AM\n      Subject: RE: [E=\r\nVP-ITC] Re: File from tonight\n\n\n      Robin,\n       \n      I agree with Ste=\r\nve on a couple of points. First let me say that I\n      do believe that we =\r\nall have a &quot;technician/guide/guardian&quot; call them what you\n      may. but I =\r\nusually call them by the names they introduced themselves by.\n       \n     =\r\n I know for a fact through many, many, many box sessions that when I turn\n =\r\n     a box on, could be Frank&#39;s box or the minibox or the RS 470 does not m=\r\natter which.\n       \n      The same two entities will come through immediat=\r\nely, So much so now, that I do not even ask for conformation that\n      it =\r\nis in fact them. I recognise their individual voice patterns. I have built =\r\na solid relationship with these two spirits\n      I know as mike and Lisa s=\r\no much so that I have even gotten to know their individual personalities.\n =\r\n      \n      There are other newer researchers here that will attest to the=\r\n fact that when they where doing their first sessions\n      I had asked my =\r\ntwo &quot;Friends&quot; Mike and Lisa to assist in getting them started and invariabl=\r\ny the spirits that came \n      through to these new researchers during thei=\r\nr first sessions identified themselves as Mike and Lisa.\n       \n      Stev=\r\ne says he does not turn on his box and use them as a crutch, that is not en=\r\ntirely true. I had done research \n      very closely with Steve until recen=\r\ntly and I would venture to say that 99% if not every session he starts with=\r\n &quot;Mike & Lisa\n      are you available to talk with me&quot; \n       \n      Also =\r\nI don&#39;t consider working with my technicians as using them as a crutch, The=\r\ny would not allow that.\n      They are not there like butlers at our beckon=\r\ned call when we feel they may be of some use.\n      Quite the opposite, wit=\r\nhout them we would get no communication at all, they are allowing us the ho=\r\nnor of receiving this \n      celestial communication. They are the moderato=\r\nrs, facilitators and generators of all we hear and send to and from the spi=\r\nrit realm.\n      And they also stand as guards and protectors to do the bes=\r\nt they can to keep us from being deceived or taken down a dark path.\n      =\r\n \n      Some here wait for others to state an opinion and then tend to agre=\r\ne with that opinion no matter what they have experienced to be true.\n      =\r\n \n      Robin, my advice to you as a new researcher in this field. Form you=\r\nr own beliefs through your experience and research.\n      Listen and learn =\r\nfrom others but do not let what you believe to be true or not, be swayed by=\r\n popular opinion.\n       \n      Bruce\n\n\n\n\n      Bruce Halliday \n\n\n      &lt;ht=\r\ntp://free-paranormalinvestigating.com/%3C/div%3E%3C/div%3E%3Cp%20/%3E%3Cdiv=\r\n%20class=3D&gt;\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n        To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n        From: MudPuddleF=\r\narm@...\n        Date: Sat, 2 Feb 2008 21:42:09 -0800\n        Subject: R=\r\ne: [EVP-ITC] Re: File from tonight\n\n\n        Steve,\n\n        I certainly ap=\r\npreciate your thoughts.

First let \n      me say that I&lt;BR&gt;do believe that we all have =\r\na \n      &quot;technician/&lt;WBR&gt;guide/guardian&quot; call them what you&lt;BR&gt;may. but I =\r\nusually \n      call them by the names they introduced themselves by.&lt;BR&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;BR&gt;I know \n      for a fact through many, many, many box sessions that =\r\nwhen I turn&lt;BR&gt;a box \n      on, could be Frank&#39;s box or the minibox or the =\r\nRS 470 does not matter \n      which.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The same two entities wil=\r\nl come through immediately, \n      So much so now, that I do not even ask f=\r\nor conformation that&lt;BR&gt;it is in \n      fact them. I recognise their indivi=\r\ndual voice patterns. I have built a \n      solid relationship with these tw=\r\no spirits&lt;BR&gt;I know as mike and Lisa so \n      much so that I have even got=\r\nten to know their individual \n      personalities.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;There are o=\r\nther newer researchers here that \n      will attest to the fact that when t=\r\nhey where doing their first \n      sessions&lt;BR&gt;I had asked my two &quot;Friends&quot;=\r\n Mike and Lisa to assist in \n      getting them started and invariably the =\r\nspirits that came &lt;BR&gt;through to \n      these new researchers during their =\r\nfirst sessions identified themselves as \n      Mike and Lisa.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nSteve says he does not turn on his box and use \n      them as a crutch, tha=\r\nt is not entirely true. I had done research &lt;BR&gt;very \n      closely with St=\r\neve until recently and I would venture to say that 99% if \n      not every =\r\nsession he starts with &quot;Mike &amp; Lisa&lt;BR&gt;are you available to \n      talk=\r\n with me&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Also I don&#39;t consider working with my \n      techni=\r\ncians as using them as a crutch, They would not allow that.&lt;BR&gt;They \n      =\r\nare not there like butlers at our beckoned call when we feel they may be \n =\r\n     of some use.&lt;BR&gt;Quite the opposite, without them we would get no \n    =\r\n  communication at all, they are allowing us the honor of receiving this \n =\r\n     &lt;BR&gt;celestial communication. They are the moderators, facilitators and=\r\n \n      generators of all we hear and send to and from the spirit realm.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;And \n      they also stand as guards and protectors to do the best they ca=\r\nn to keep \n      us from being deceived or taken down a dark path.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;Some here \n      wait for others to state an opinion and then tend to =\r\nagree with that \n      opinion no matter what they have experienced to be \n=\r\n      true.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Robin, my advice to you as a new researcher in thi=\r\ns \n      field. Form your own beliefs through your experience and \n      re=\r\nsearch.&lt;BR&gt;Listen and learn from others but do not let what you believe \n  =\r\n    to be true or not, be swayed by popular \n      opinion.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Br=\r\nuce&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n      &lt;P align=3Dcenter&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D4&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0033c=\r\nc&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT \n      color=3D#000000 size=3D5&gt;Bruce Halliday &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FO=\r\nNT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A \n      title=3Dhttp://free-paranormalinvestigating.=\r\ncom/%3C/div%3E%3C/div%3E%3Cp%20/%3E%3Cdiv%20class=3D \n      href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nfree-paranormalinvestigating.com/%3C/div%3E%3C/div%3E%3Cp%20/%3E%3Cdiv%20cl=\r\nass=3D&quot; \n      target=3D_blank&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n      &lt;BLOCKQ=\r\nUOTE&gt;\n        &lt;HR&gt;\n        To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;BR&gt;From: \n     =\r\n   MudPuddleFarm@&lt;WBR&gt;msn.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Sat, 2 Feb 2008 21:42:09 \n        -0=\r\n800&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: File from tonight&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n        &lt;DIV id=\r\n=3DEC_EC_ygrp-mlmsg&gt;\n        &lt;DIV id=3DEC_EC_ygrp-msg&gt;\n        &lt;DIV id=3DEC=\r\n_EC_ygrp-text&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;Steve,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;I certainly appreciate your thoughts.&nbsp; In the back =\r\nof my mind \n        is always the question of whether we are being Deceived=\r\n.&nbsp; Just for \n        the sake of argument, is it POSSIBLE we&#39;re being =\r\nmanipulated by \n        something evil?&nbsp; I&#39;m not frightened, and I won=\r\n&#39;t stop my own \n        research (the negative stuff just makes me more det=\r\nermined), but my mind \n        does go there sometimes.&nbsp; I hope that a=\r\nlong with developing my \n        &quot;ear&quot;&nbsp;I can acquire the gift of disce=\r\nrnment.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;Robin&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORD=\r\nER-LEFT: #000000 2px solid&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;----=\r\n- Original Message ----- &lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nB&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A \n          title=3Dmailto:urkel23@... href=3D&quot;mailto:urk=\r\nel23@...&quot;&gt;Steve \n          Hultay&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FO=\r\nNT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A \n          title=3Dmailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups=\r\n.com \n          href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups=\r\n&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt; \n          &lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nB&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Saturday, February 02, 2008 \n          8:57 PM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          =\r\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; [EVP-ITC] Re: File from \n  =\r\n        tonight:&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV id=3DEC_EC_=\r\nygrp-text&gt;Robin,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If i may add my thoughts on \n          this: There =\r\nis no concrete evidence of &lt;BR&gt;who or what comes through \n          is what=\r\n they say they are.
