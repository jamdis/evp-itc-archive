 There's a difference bertween linear and random, like entities maybe? Las=
t night it was like some of these guys been waiting awhile to speak. I woul=
dn't say one way is better, it's just---different. This latest test board i=
s dual mode, random, and linear, plus the tone control mod. There's still a=
 problem of the random voltage not wanting to start up wihtout a little twe=
ak of the DC offset. That's the next problem to address tonight, maybe it j=
ust needs a fixed voltage reference that is independent of battery voltage =
variations. I'm gonna need a crash day to sleep here pretty soon! I stayed =
up till 2:30 this morning. I'm a master cat knapper though.
