From what I have read from people who study the Mayan calender is that 2012=
 is just a point in time that a large astronomical shift happens. It doesn'=
t point to disaster or anything else. These events have happened in the pas=
t and will happen far past the 2012 date. It is the doomsdayers and second-=
coming types who place the dark meaning to the date. 

They describe these =
astronomical events as things like eclipses, solor cycles, or comets and su=
ch. No legitimate study of the calendar has ever predicted a doomsday event=
.

Not my information, just what I read on the subject.

Thanx,

Frank R.
