Perhaps\n&gt; some of them are not allowed to cross just yet, maybe there are goofy&#39;s over\n&gt; there too that enjoy playing pranks, so they will say anything just to keep\n&gt; us talking to them, maybe they get lonely esp. when they happen to be\n&gt; &quot;stuck&quot; somewhere.  There are so many factors, and they are probably not\n&gt; able to see all, otherwise, we would all be rich from winning the lotto by\n&gt; now.

For example, my file was very clear that\n&gt; said &quot;marker&quot;. It doesn&#39;t mean that we are all nuts, that&#39;s the information\n&gt; that was given to us. It was a direct response to a question that i asked.\n&gt; It&#39;s not our fault that they gave me bad info, they probably didn&#39;t know the\n&gt; answer.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to treat them like some retarded idiots over there, i wish to\n&gt; give them respect. The fact in my mind is that they are saying something and\n&gt; just because they didn&#39;t get your test right doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s any less\n&gt; fascinating to me that something talks that shouldn&#39;t. They probably could\n&gt; care less what&#39;s on your monitor.\n&gt;\n&gt; They are probably sitting there trying to figure out why you aren&#39;t doing\n&gt; anything yourself.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Frank Sumption\n&gt; &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; DAH! again. There&#39;s way to much expectation created in trying to guess,\n&gt; so\n&gt; &gt; participants minds interfere with whatever spirit communication there\n&gt; might\n&gt; &gt; be. You do not understand how this communcations works, nor do you\n&gt; &gt; understand the effects of the observer, you can not seperate the observer\n&gt; &gt; from the event in the pararnormal. therefore any results are\n&gt; invalid--before\n&gt; &gt; you go puffing your chest out thinking how clever you are in debunking\n&gt; &gt; spirit communication. Even your own expectation that no valid information\n&gt; &gt; will be received is enough to block all information.

This experiment asked for participants to determine what\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; object was. Vague or partial answers would not be counted (for example,\n&gt; just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; giving a color, shape, size, what it&#39;s made of, etc): we&#39;re looking for\n&gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#39;t\n&gt; count.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other\n&gt; means\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they chose.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the object at the start\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this\n&gt; group.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The idea with this file is that you could download it at the beginning\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the experiment and &#39;keep it safe&#39; on your computer. Then at the end of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiment, I would post the password so you can reveal the contents of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; file. That way, you were in control of the original image during the\n&gt; entire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time, not me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Passworded pdf:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.pdf\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The password for that file is: 2plus2isFour\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Instructions, if you need them for the other files, are also in that RJ\n&gt; &gt; &gt; folder.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So to the results:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Number of participants: 6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Total tries: 29\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ambiguous answers: 0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Correct answers: 0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Object: Chair\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Object picture:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.jpg\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As a little side experiment, on Monday I also asked if anyone had\n&gt; gotten\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any answers that might indicate an article of clothing (though I did\n&gt; not say\n&gt; &gt; &gt; why I was asking). One theory is that the human operator can be\n&gt; influenced\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by things they already know or suspect, and so interpret audio with\n&gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; own personal &#39;educated guesses&#39;, that would differ from what they would\n&gt; hear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; had they not known those things. This side experiment did indicate some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; support for that theory, since before I mentioned &#39;articles of\n&gt; clothing&#39;, no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one included an article of clothing in their results. But after I\n&gt; mentioned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it, several reports of clothing began to appear. I did not add these\n&gt; tries\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the results above.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let\n&gt; me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know. Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this experiment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     \n&gt;\n\nThe only way o assu e a ue es is o ac ually \"TELL\" a us ed sou ce wha was done.
