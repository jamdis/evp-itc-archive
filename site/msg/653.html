<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This is close to my home, at teh Stanley Motel. I probably won&#x27;t go, I need 
to spend too much for parts. I found this through the Ghost Village.



&gt;
&gt;Calling All Ghost Hunters and Ghost Lovers,
&gt;
&gt;The National Ghost Hunters Getaway is proud to present
&gt;
&gt;���The Shining��� Investigation
&gt;
&gt;January 27th &amp; 28th 2007
&gt;
&gt;Join professional, amateur hunters and just plain ghost lovers as they 
&gt;investigate the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, CO. This magnificent Hotel was 
&gt;the inspiration to Stephen King���s ���The Shining��� and he himself spent time 
&gt;there developing his horrific nightmare, that we still enjoy today. Granted 
&gt;the spirits in his award winning book are more on the devilish side. The 
&gt;hotel does house some of the less life threatening spooks and has possibly 
&gt;done so shortly after its opening in 1909. This amazing structure offers 
&gt;the ghost hunters a late night investigation as we venture into it���s 
&gt;darkened halls and closed down facilities. The night may hold an eerie 
&gt;silent chill, but who���s to say some spirits are just dieing to speak to an 
&gt;unsuspecting ghost hunter. So spend the weekend learning what other ghost 
&gt;hunters do, collecting evidence, sharing your findings or just make new 
&gt;paranormal friends as we investigate the ghosts of Haunted Stanley Hotel.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Tickets for this event are $35 per person

&gt;Rooms are $99 a night (double occupancy) for this special event
