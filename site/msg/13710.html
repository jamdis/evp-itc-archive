I think it is always ok to propose a theory that some instance like this mi=
ght be a real giant head, floating in thje sky.=A0 But then, you have to as=
k stuff like, ok, are there better or easier or more realistic explanations=
 of what this could be?=A0 In this case, since we know clouds can form shap=
es that look like other things, and since we know we can see shapes in clou=
ds that aren't there, and since as far as we know there are very few giant =
floating heads in the sky, then in this case, I agree, that the most intell=
igent course is to overide the giant head theory and replace it with an "I'=
m experiencing pareidolia" theory.=A0 And let that one hold, until some mor=
e compelling evidence proposes perhaps a different theory.
