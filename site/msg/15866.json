Thanks for posting them.\nI see there are some mark ups to the older cct.\nGot a MK484 or two somewhere, and some MVAM109 varicaps that will be OK. \nNo Radio Shack down this part of the world, and they dont do export mail orders, but can order stuff from mouser.\nJEFF\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  The TRF schematics--hopefully it makes sense.  The antenna coil core for\n&gt; the MK484 is from a junker AM radio--the larger the better. You can add a\n&gt; ten turn secondary coil to the antenna core, to couple in an external\n&gt; antenna wire. The external antenna really helps with the TRF radio.  The\n&gt; varactor diodes can be scavenged from an old car tuner--if ya know what to\n&gt; look for. Or get the NTE618 from  mouser.com, I think it was\n&gt; electonics123(on line) that had the MK484, everything else can be had at\n&gt; Radio shack.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
