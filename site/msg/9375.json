Since you are also a dog owner I\nknow you will appreciate this.\n\nThe day before yesterday I received an EVP. Male Voice.\n\nHe takes what sounds like a breath and says...Pooch. :)\n\nI, of course always have Molly, my Jack Russell Terrier by my side\nwhen I record.\n\nSo, I guess I have a Spirit Friend that loves animals too. \n\nGrin.\n\nTake care.\n\nMany Blessings All,\n\nJeremy\nNew York, New York"}
