&gt; Lc,
&gt;  
&gt; It depends alot on the signal quality at the time of the session
&gt; I tried a noise canceling mic from olympus but I think it actualy
&gt; supressed some of the voice quality. I believe that they also 
utilize 
&gt; some of the white noise that is transmitted with the radio signal.
&gt;  
&gt; I now only use the recorder with its built in mic and seem to gleen 
&gt; the best results that way. If your recordings are to noisy use can 
always
&gt; remove some of the static hiss after on your audio editor.
&gt;  
&gt; I use clearvoice denoiser on the lowest setting it does not alter 
the sound of
&gt; the recording just removes the unwanted noise.

&gt; 
&gt; Bruce, I think I asked this before, but what microphone are you 
using and how is everything plugged together? If I understand 
correctly, you are using an older 12-470 with a mic in front of it 
recording you and the built-in speaker, correct? Your earlier 
recordings sounded like a studio mic or something - very nice.I have 
been playing with the Listen Up mic into the recorder, as well as a 
lapel mic. You seem to have less static...I am going to go listen to 
your latest uploads and let you know what I think.LC--- In EVP-
