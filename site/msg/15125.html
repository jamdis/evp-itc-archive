  Uploaded by : clockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt; 
  Description : This evp says &quot;don&#x27;t forget the sandwich&quot; and is funny because I stopped at Arby&#x27;s on the way home. Had ARBYS on my mind :) And didnt even know it.......scary. Hahahahaha. This one was at the end of the recording from tonight. Heard  &quot; Hey Hommie-Momma said I;m a big girl&quot; for a total of 3 different voices at the water trough tonight during a 4 minute recording.
