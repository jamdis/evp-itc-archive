Now i&#39;ve\nbeen looking around in my house at the walls and the like and I see\nhundreds of faces like you see in ITC. In the on-line game I play I\nstopped to observe some of the walls and the like in the game and\nthere they are mixed in with the wall, almost like they make up the wall.\n\nIn the wall paper of my win xp desktop landscape I see them as well.\n\nI&#39;m wondering if anyone else notices this sort of thing or if im just\nout of my mind:)\n\nRichard"}
