<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, if it came right out and told me it was pure, unadulterated  
evil and wanted to eat parts of me for supper or something--I suspect  
I&#x27;d tell it to get stuffed and &quot;thanks for playing,&quot; turn off the  
radio, and ask my personal friends on the other side to make it go  
home. Pretty much end of story.

&gt; Good answer! Fear is a bitch isn&#x27;t it. How it creeps in?
&gt;
&gt; As a matter of fact, I want everyone who is willing to tell me  
&gt; (worse case scenario) what you think will happen to you if a purely  
&gt; &quot;evil&quot; being was to enter your session? Just curious?!

&gt; Oh dear. Here we go again.
&gt;
&gt; Look, Babs--it&#x27;s really just this simple: if you are scared of  
&gt; lower entities and you think that the hacked radio you are using is  
&gt; really a channel for demon or whatever, then just stop. Put the  
&gt; fricking radio down and go get another hobby. Leave it to those of  
&gt; us who aren&#x27;t afraid and don&#x27;t care if someone calls us a bitch or  
&gt; a slut and tries to pawn themselves off as Bazoozoo.
&gt;
&gt; Just. Stop. Listening. And. Worrying.
&gt;
&gt; And on top of all that, in this quote below, you seem to be saying  
&gt; that the rest of us don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re doing or are being fooled  
&gt; by entities that only you have sussed. Guess what? You&#x27;re wrong on  
&gt; both counts, HMO.

&gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve recently started analyzing a 40 min 469 session. The results are
&gt;&gt; scary. I&#x27;d say at this point, and I&#x27;m only 1/2 way through, 90% of  
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; communication is negative in nature and mentions many supposed  
&gt;&gt; Demonic
&gt;&gt; names. The layers of voices are, in many cases, multiple. Often, the
&gt;&gt; listener hears very little of what is actually said. The voices  
&gt;&gt; can be
&gt;&gt; mocking or downright crude. I have not yet formed an opinion fully  
&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt; it would seem to me that these models are easy devices for lower  
&gt;&gt; level
&gt;&gt; entities to figure out how to use. I can not speak of the  
&gt;&gt; attitudes or
&gt;&gt; fears of those investigators present although at times, their voices
&gt;&gt; are a bit shaky.
