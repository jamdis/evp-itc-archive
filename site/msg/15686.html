did you play your file back ?  if you recorded it I would bet there  was 
all kinds of info on it, sometimes they start, at least for me, they started  
like more evp's  then real time, now they do both, and at times, they  are 
all chating at once it seems.  I think they are talking to each other,  not 
just to us. sf

I have had a couple sessions now and still have not heard anything.   I am 
wondering too if the spirits are still listening to me and letting me get  
my "feet wet" before they will speak to me.  I have been polite and have  
used both AM and FM bands.  I tell them who I am, the day, time and  location.  
I let them know my purpose for communicating and I ask for  their help.  I 
am being patient with the process.

Thanks so much, Misty. I will see if I can ask them to speak as one,  
because I think you hit the nail right on the head -- I do hear them speaking  
over each other, half in male, half in female, so maybe things would improve  
like you said if they organized into one collective voice. Can they still  
answer questions about individuals this way, or are you limited to 
generalized  queries?

Regarding your statement: "Quite often when a new  speaker
comes forth a bit of a training session can be heard for how they  can
speak so that my physical self can hear what is said." So by this, do  you 
mean it's possible it takes a couple of sessions for the entity to master  
this new method of communication? For instance, I got my grandmother' s name  
(among others) during Tuesday's session, but she said nothing, wouldn't 
answer  our questions; Wednesday, she suddenly started talking and was the 
primary  person we communicated with, even correctly answered my mother's 
questions  about her childhood pets. Could this be because there's a learning 
curve  involved with talking through the radio? Does it take a session or two 
before  they "get the hang of it"? Or is it all dependent on my skills?

Oh, and  wanted to say I'm going out tomorrow to buy all the canned goods 
at the  grocery store in anticipation of the nuclear winter we are about to 
endure...  Just kidding. Hearing about all that stuff they are predicting, it 
does make  me wonder, though, why they would go to such trouble to tell you 
all that  again and again -- what's to gain from it? It's not stirring 
anybody up.
