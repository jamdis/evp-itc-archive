Reading the posts fr=
om the last week as I do every sat morning it is my 
opinion that some of t=
hem have a very polite condescending tone to 
them.This group and the peopl=
e in it have always been very helpful and 
a joy to do research with I hope=
 it stays that way I would hate to see 
it become one of "those" boards if =
you know what I mean (my 1 cent had 
to do it). so anyway
One productive id=
ea that I saw from one of this weeks posts was to send 
the same file privi=
tly to a few people and see what they hear in it. 
Unpromtide by file names=
 or other posts about it. I have a couple files 
that I feel are pretty cle=
ar. So if you would like to volunteer just 
send me an email with your emai=
l adress and I will send you a file not 
too long but it will be unedited a=
nd in its original form.
I will not amplify it or edit or change it in anyw=
ay from its original. 
Those who recive the files do the same NO editing un=
till you render 
your opinion to me about it after that you can do what u l=
ike with it.
Remember after listening email me DO NOT post what you hear on=
 the 
board I will do that later when I have everyones opinion.
