It&#39;s *not* &quot;&#39;kay,&quot; as in short for okay. It is &quot;kick.&quot; With headphones, it&#39;s very clear. Any guesses on what these terms possibly might mean?  \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Ann%27s%20files/functionkick010208.mp3 \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles\n\nRegards,\n\nlisbyfarrum &lt;lisby@...&gt;"}
