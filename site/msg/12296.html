<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I dont do so good with the robotic voices tho they seem to come thru no 
matter the method being used. The robotic allophone type sound leaves 
to many possible conclusions for my brain &quot;sounds like/could be&quot; and I 
did listen to your file but even after amplification I was unable to 
decide what I thought I heard. &quot;your wife wont care if she likes you&quot; 
Definitely different than what others think they hear in it.

I always go back to who did the recording. What do you hear? The 
messages are meant for your ears not mine so that usually plays a key 
role in what comes thru.

&gt; at around 4am Sunday I started recording while I sat here on the 
&gt; computer and recorded this &quot;robotic&quot; voice. I cannot make out what is 
&gt; being said. Could someone listen and let me know what they hear.

&gt; Thank you
