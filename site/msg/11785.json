At least that&#39;s what we \ntry to do: 1) research public records 2) gather psychic impressions \n3) engage in ITC experiments and paranormal field research. Then \ncompare the results of all three methods. oh yeah, plus enjoy \nyourself in the process as it can be amazing. -Bill M\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kolrone&quot; &lt;a.cronk@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Depends on the ghost. lol\n&gt; \n&gt; -Aaron\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Elabeth &lt;elabeth@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Does it speak English? haha\n&gt; &gt; ~Elabeth\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Thu, Aug 14, 2008 at 4:07 PM, Frank Sumption\n&gt; &gt; &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.strapya-world.com/categories/12_3202_880.html\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s like 20 bucks!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  F-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
