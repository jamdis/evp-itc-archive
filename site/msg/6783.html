Hi Frank,
 
It is nice to see you back here again.  And I love your screen  name.  You 
are right when you say you can never force or coerce a spirit to  communicate 
with.  For those that are able to communicate with them we do  feel extremely 
priviledged and honored that they have chosen to do so.   Even when there is no 
communication just listening and hearing what they have to  say is very 
amazing in itself.  What they say may not always be nice but  maybe they know more 
about us than we give them credit for?
 
Jeff

I made one today, same as the last except I can adjust the sweep  level, and 
where in the band the sweep starts, or do manual sweep. I used to  put this 
function in the boxes, but no one used it, too busy asking stupid  questions, or 
showing the world what great mediums they were cuz they had a  box,  so I 
started leaving it out to save parts, and front panel  space. 

I don't think you can force, or coerce spirit, I've  always thought it best 
just to allow. 

Curious--these  are for me a change, and they are flying together. Never 
before  have I made a board in 24 hours, it required only a slight shift in the  
concept.
