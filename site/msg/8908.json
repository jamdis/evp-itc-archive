That \n&gt; makes this more real to me and they know that.  I don&#39;t believe they \n&gt; curse because they don&#39;t like me, i think they know i post the audio \n&gt; for others to hear and want to prove their existence.  I also got \n&gt; the &quot;Are We Dead?&quot; file.  That maybe the first clear message that&#39;s \n&gt; relevant to what we are doing, it must be grounded spirits asking \n&gt; that.  If anyone has any thoughts of who would say that, it may be \n&gt; another discussion.  Maybe it&#39;s not grounded spirits, but whom than?\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
