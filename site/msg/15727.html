Honestly, I think it is impossible to understand the perspective in which t=
hese "beings" are relaying their information. They may not even be speaking=
 of this reality but of something else. They may not even be completely con=
scious when connecting to you for communication. A lot of you assume this i=
s some type of telephone call were you are dealing with a completely cohera=
nt person on the other end of the line. This is a connection between you an=
d whatever is out there that shares your attitude and emotional disposition=
, the radio, box or whatever has very little to do with it. The stronger yo=
ur psi connection or "bridge" is with the other entity the better or more c=
lear your connection will be.

I don't think I have ever received predictio=
ns of future events. Everything I get has dealt with the present! Sumption =
is right, if you have expectations then you have made a lot of assumptions,=
 which means on some level you think you know what is going on or how this =
communication is coming about and who it is with. If you want this very rea=
l communication to work then you have to approach it with now expectations,=
 assume nothing and have a positive outlook.

Hard to know why the voices =
seem to play with people. I have had files that validated objects that I wa=
s holding in my hand, so I do believe that it is possible for earthbound sp=
irits to communicate with us, as well as other beings from other realms. Ca=
n never know their intentions though, and it can be discouraging when these=
 entities choose to toy with us or trick us. Guess there is not anything we=
 really can do about it, however I do believe that there is something very =
important going on with box communication, and even though it isn't fully u=
nderstood, can be a very powerful source of communitation. I hope that if a=
 break from building and researching is necessary, then have a good one. It=
 is my hope though that you do not just abandon this line of communication =
no matter how frustrating it can be from time to time.

thanks
Andy
