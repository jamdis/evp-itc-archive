That was model #SRF-M37V if \nanyone is interested, that model is available at most electronic \nstore chains.  So, how&#39;s the 470 hack coming???  I was thinking of \ngiving that model another shot, but my local radio shack was out of \nstock yesterday.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Have you ever been called out to investigate paranormal activity \n&gt; happening in a shower, only when the water is running?\n&gt; Or maybe to an area where it happens only when it rains. Don&#39;t you \nwish \n&gt; you could have taken your ghost box out there with you, but were \nafraid \n&gt; it would get all wet and ruin the sensitive electronic circuitry?\n&gt; Well... worry no more. Now you can take ghost box functionality \nwith \n&gt; you when you&#39;re all wet, or at least the environment you&#39;re in is \nall \n&gt; wet. Now you can listen to those ghosts, singing in the shower.. :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s a video that shows you how to make a waterprroof SONY ICF-\nS79V \n&gt; into a ghost box with non-stop sweeping audio.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmSjEug601Q\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike Coletta (UFO Geek)\n&gt; http://www.ufomagazine.net\n&gt;"}
