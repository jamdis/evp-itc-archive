          Hi,
 
I listened to your files, they are pretty good
I heard most as you do.
 
They are a bit noisy and fast, if you get a simple audio editing program
you will be able to reduce some of the static noise and also slow the speed of the 
file slightly so as to hear it better.
 
you want to avoid changing the file in any way but to make
it a bit clearer and a bit slower does no harm. The file that are unmistakable and virtually
noise free you can leave as recorded. Also if you want to post files I would leave all but the 
fastest and noisiest untouched so that your peers can hear the original.
 
you can clean all your personal files so that you may better understand the meaning
of the message and not miss anything, for your research purpouses.
 
keep up the good work
Bruce
