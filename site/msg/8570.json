It works!!!\n   \n&gt;   Thanks Guys\n   \n&gt;   Rees\n   \n&gt;   Stefan Bion wrote:\n&gt;   Hi Rees,\n\n&gt; ok, this is the original file I made. I tested it - it works on my PC.\n\n&gt;&gt; Windows 2000 professional\n\n&gt; Same as mine.\n\n&gt;&gt; Sound card unkown\n\n&gt; Could be important...\n\n&gt; Did you check the EVPmaker settings on your PC as I described? It might\n&gt; be that another device, such as a webcam, has made itself the default\n&gt; sound device. Try to select a different sound device, if available.\n\n&gt; Stefan"}
