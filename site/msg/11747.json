I have the 469 hack, as\n&gt; well as an Olympus WS-110 digital recorder, and a mic. I am trying to\n&gt; configure my system to allow me to record not only my voice, but the\n&gt; hack at the same time. I ran a y-adapter from the mic input on the\n&gt; Olympus to the 469 as well as a mic. Now when I record, the mic does\n&gt; not record, only the 469. The mic acts as a speaker. What am I doing\n&gt; wrong here? I don&#39;t have an audio input on my laptop, just a built in\n&gt; mic. Any suggestions?\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
