Snowfire, Frank has asked me that before. My reply has been that I have tri=
ed, and never gotten anything that I would consider paranormal, and so neve=
r posted any. So the best thing to do seems to be to try to find the best w=
ay to get results.=C2=A0 I think by arranging these experiments, that will =
not only help me, but others, who are trying to explore what's going on her=
e.
