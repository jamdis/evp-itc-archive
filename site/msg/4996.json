Dont feel bad. Same thing happened to me except it didnt=\r\n even fly out of my hands, the hack seemed to go fine, but when I went to p=\r\nut it back together the wire came undone from the battery casing so he went=\r\n to his friends house and resoldered it on for me brought it back put it in=\r\n my hands for me to put the screws in and I noticed now there was a big bla=\r\nck wire from the speaker section undone as well. He then went back to his f=\r\nriends resoldered that wire, brought it back, I put it together and powers =\r\nup, scans fine...manual...auto...BUT there are no stations being picked up =\r\nat all. LOL\n\n  Worked fine before I touched it (reception wise) but now its=\r\n sittin in a box waitin for me to mail it to Franks radio graveyard soon as=\r\n I get my butt in gear now that the holiday mail rush is coming to an end. =\r\nHe said he can probably fix it. I bet he can LOL its probably just another =\r\nwire come undone I didnt see underneath. Or somethin i did wrong. I aint op=\r\nening it again they will all fly off at me or somethin if i do LOL. Or he c=\r\nan rip it to shreds for the parts. Gonna leave the building to the builders=\r\n.
