<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Jeremy,

Thanks... I&#x27;ll check it out.

As an afterthought, to share this information I decided to probably put
together a video production of this entire event.

From UFO Geek Paradoc Productions...  the paranormal documentary, &quot;Final
communication from a fatal flight&quot;, or something like that.  I decided
to start this during my vacation break later this month.
I&#x27;ll even travel to the plane crash site point of impact, as well as
performing sessions with the debris in my lab.

I&#x27;ve heard that wires sometime retain imprinted information or
communication (like those old wire recorders).
Some of the wire bundle I have may have contained communication or
electrical pulses just before the crash.

This video will be the perfect time to test some of the paranormal
prototypes, as well as a new one I designed, but haven&#x27;t shared yet.
It&#x27;s an ITC System design that uses bright light, mirrors, lenses, along
with an optical coupler and a few other surprises.

I have enough researched information and items to work with to put
together an hour long or more documentary.
I&#x27;ll have to see if Youtube will let me put more than 10 minutes at a
time on their servers, otherwise I&#x27;ll have to break it up into parts.

This will all be new to me, but it&#x27;s worth the attempt.

&gt; Very interesting, Mike. I&#x27;m not sure if you know about Psychometry or
not, but it would be worth a few minutes of your time to research. Just
google it.

&gt; From: M.A. Coletta (Mike) michaelcoletta@...&gt;
&gt; Greetings fellow researchers,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Okay... on with my story.
&gt; While sitting in my hotel room last week I continued to read one of
&gt; Sarah Estep&#x27;s books. In one of the chapters she writes about the plane
&gt; crash into the Potomac River, which happened a number of years ago.
Many
&gt; people died when the airplane went into that frozen river, and she
&gt; explains how she and others began receiving messages from the crash
&gt; victims at almost the exact time time crash occurred, even though she
&gt; didn&#x27;t know about the crash at the time.
&gt;
&gt; She then writes about the crash of two jumbo jets, where hundreds lost
&gt; their lives instantly, or soon after the accident. And how the spirit
&gt; world was filled with communication because of this large disaster.
&gt;
&gt; That got me thinking...
&gt;
&gt; I too have always been super sensitive about deadly plane crashes,
&gt; feeling for the families of the victims, as well as, and especially
for
&gt; the victims themselves.
&gt;
&gt; One crash in particular put me into the extensive research mode about
&gt; the crash and the victims. So-much-so that I contacted the wife of the
&gt; plane&#x27;s pilot, where I was able to help put some closure into her
world
&gt; after a number of contacts. (Not wanting to discuss too much, let me
&gt; just say I was able to view things she was not allowed to view. And
&gt; after doing so I was able to describe things to her that she always
&gt; wondered about.)
&gt;
&gt; The commercial aircraft in question crashed so violently that remains
of
&gt; the passengers were never all recovered. And after years of legal
&gt; battling, the settlements were made and the entire aircraft wreckage
was
&gt; released to a salvage company.
&gt; I was there, at the warehouse, when the many trucks left with the many
&gt; pieces of plane, enroute to their salvage yard. And while there I
&gt; talked with the attorney and investigative lead, who were both
on-scene
&gt; to over-see the finalization of this effort.
&gt;
&gt; To get off topic for a bit, I for one am of the opinion that in the
&gt; spirit communication world, an object is key if communication with a
&gt; specific entity is desired. I know many do not agree, and think that
&gt; open communication is possible anytime, anywhere... but I&#x27;m not one of
&gt; those people.
&gt;
&gt; I may be wrong or I may be right, but I think an object or location
are
&gt; a must when specific communication is desired. hence, the reason I
stand
&gt; next to a certain grave site, or location where a death actually
&gt; happened, or have a related object in hand or near where a session is
&gt; being done.
&gt;
&gt; Okay... having said that, while I was observing the movement of the
&gt; plane crash debris, I was offered a small piece or two by those who
now
&gt; owned the salvage material. (No longer in litigation and no longer
owned
&gt; by the airline company). I refused acceptance of anything at the time,
&gt; but asked if the salvage company had, by chance, forgotten something
in
&gt; the warehouse or on the grounds, was it okay for a person to possess
it.
&gt; They told me, yes.
&gt;
&gt; Later that evening, when all the material had been moved out of the
&gt; warehouse, I once again visited the scene. Looking around I found they
&gt; had done a very good job at clean-up, only leaving a few pieces of
small
&gt; metal, wire, paper, and fabric near the large doors.
&gt;
&gt; I picked up the few items that were still there and headed toward the
&gt; large trash container that was on the property, my intensions to drop
&gt; those items into the trash. But, while holding them I received a very
&gt; strong feeling, a very emotional sensation that would not allow me to
&gt; put them in the trash. It was so strong in-fact, that I began crying.
&gt; It just flowed through me, consuming me as it went.
&gt;
&gt; My emotional feeling was just like it had been earlier in the day when
I
&gt; placed one hand on one of the engines that were mangled and filled
with
&gt; impacted dirt that was once the ground in the place that became the
&gt; final resting place.
&gt;
&gt; Once I arrived home, I carefully placed the small amount of debris
&gt; material (metal, wire, carpet fabric, paper, etc.) into a sealed glass
&gt; canister, where it remains to this day.
&gt;
&gt; Where am I going with this story...???
&gt;
&gt; Two weeks from now, I have a two week vacation coming... which will be
&gt; spent at home.
&gt;
&gt; After reading Sarah Estep&#x27;s book, especially the chapter about the
plane
&gt; crash victims, I&#x27;ve decided to use those objects I acquired from the
&gt; warehouse grounds, as the objects that may help me make some specific
&gt; spirit contacts.
&gt; I have already researched that crash, and I have all the victims
names,
&gt; along with some information of there life&#x27;s. Maybe I will be able to
&gt; gain information and answer some questions... so I can contact others,
&gt; besides the original contact with the pilot&#x27;s wife, as I told you
about
&gt; earlier in my writing.
&gt;
&gt; All I can do is try... and see what happens.
