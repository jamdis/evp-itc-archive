<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am going to go check them out again, to make sure they are the old 
ones, absolutely.  They are grey and white, I know that much, and 
they are 12-470....so I&#x27;ll check next week. If they are, I will buy 
them both, even if for someone else to give away for the cost only.

&gt; Hi Laura.  I would recommend you buy BOTH of the old 12-470&#x27;s, as 
those units are very 
&gt; hard to come by.  I&#x27;m sure someone would be happy to buy the second 
one from you, and 
&gt; you can make use of the first.  If you don&#x27;t like it, you can sell 
it too. 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ve not tried the 20-125 or the 12-820, so someone else will have 
to give you feedback 
&gt; about how they all compare.  The one that really stands out (in not 
a good way) from the 
&gt; other hackables is the new 12-469.  It has an annoying click-click-
clicking, which some 
&gt; can easily tune out and others cannot.  I have it, as well as the 
old version 12-469, and old 
&gt; 12-470.
&gt; 
&gt; For manual radio sweep (turning the dial back and forth yourself), 
I like to use the Duracell 
&gt; KP028.  It comes in a 2-pack for around $30, including shipping 
from places like Amazon 
&gt; and eBay.  You might be able to find them in a local store.  I got 
mine from Costco.  Not 
&gt; sure if they have those in your area or not.  I&#x27;ve had better 
results with this unit than I have 
&gt; any of the shack hacks, though I still find the hacks fun to play 
with.  
&gt; 
&gt; Others feel they have had better results with the hacks as compared 
to manual sweep.  Not 
&gt; sure if it has to do with the model of radio they are using or 
not.  I have tried multiple 
&gt; manual sweep units, and that is how I came to like the Duracell as 
my favorite so far.  I 
&gt; also like the Durapro emergency radio, but the thumb dial gives me 
blisters!
&gt; 
&gt; I guess it&#x27;s just like digital recorders ... one person can get 
great EVP with a certain make 
&gt; and model, while another person will get nothing with it.  LOL - 
for me, the Olympus I 
&gt; have seems to be like that.  I&#x27;ve never had much luck with it.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, time for me to hit the sack.
