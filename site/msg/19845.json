It seems to be a normal function of our own minds(living or\n&gt; &gt; dead), the same as reverse speech. I found some faces in old EVPs from boxes\n&gt; &gt; and also in music files. The ones from Evanescence are pretty impressive in\n&gt; &gt; person, and do not seem to be intentionaly embedded.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know, it&#39;s not ghost hunters, and most don&#39;t want to have to think.\n&gt; &gt; I think most want this stuff in a neat little box, all well defined, all\n&gt; &gt; rules and protocols known, but it just won&#39;t stay in one box, or universe\n&gt; &gt; for that matter.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Dear Frank,\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that I see what you mean. I mean no offense, but I it would be helpful to see something a little more definitive that couldn&#39;t be mistaken for matrixing. Is this possible? Is it just me?\n&gt; \n&gt; - Adrienne\n&gt;"}
