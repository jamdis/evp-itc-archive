Hello Richard
A lot of the evp recordings I have done seem to be out of context, 
however I have received some
direct responses. Some sound human, some sound prerecorded and some 
sound robotic.
All in all - extremely interesting.
I record in a variety of places and usually always carry my RCA Digital 
recorder with me at all times and
it leads to some puzzling results. But that is what makes this so fun, 
you never know what you will get.

Just an observation. With ITC and EVP it seems the voices and images<br>
are real but almost always the images and voice seem prerecorded, sort<br>
of like something you would see in a movie or magazine or listen to on<br>
the radio, like some sort of imprint in the unseen world rather than a<br>

  <br>
This leads me to believe that energy imprints itself into the unseen<br>
world but is not necessarily a living entity. This is especially true<br>
with ITC as i've seen no interaction. However, I've seen some<br>
interaction with evp but never any really meaningful interaction,<br>
