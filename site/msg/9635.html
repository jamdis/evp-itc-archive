2. Dangers which Mankind faces if SPIRICOM is not used wisely Since his beginnings, Man has been faced with the fact that individually and collectively he has the power to act for good or evil. As his knowledge of the energetic nature of the cosmos has expanded, Man has found that every energy so far identified -- from sexual energy to atomic energy -- can be used for his benefit or for his downfall. He will find that the energies involved in SPIRICOM are also of a nature that can be used to help him grow mentally and spiritually and become more God-like (that is more like the beings on the higher planes) or they can be focused on trivia which will make it even harder for him to grow out of the present deplorable mess in which Western civilization's social, economic and political actions are tending toward disintegration.
 ----------------
  * For the spiritually oriented, we report some advice given by high level spirit communicators: If SPIRICOM researchers adhere to the following procedure they will not suffer possession by negative forces. First thing in the morning say, "I will wear the protective cloak of the Christ light until I retire tonight." On retiring make a similar decree for the night hours. (Note: The Christ light is said to have overshadowed and inspired Jesus of Nazareth continually during the last three years of his earth life.)
