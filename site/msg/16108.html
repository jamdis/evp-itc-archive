Again, I am talking about background radiation such as is found at Chernoby=
l.

According to my research, this is the most radioactive spot on the face=
 of the earth. Even so, the level of radiation found in the accessible area=
s of Chernobyl is mostly no higher then half of what you get with a dental =
x-ray. The levels here are not high enough to effect any electronic equipme=
nt we normally use. The only equipment that may be effected would be equipm=
ent that is poorly shielded.

Here is a link to Timm Suess's Chernobyl jour=
nal. He is photographer that has been to and toured Chernobyl: http://timms=
uess.com/chernobyl-journal/

I asked Timm about the effect the radioactivit=
y found at Chernobyl had on electronic equipment. Her is his reply to me:

=
  "Hi April

  Thanks for your feedback! Glad you like my photographs!

  I=
nteresting question about the interference of radiation with my equipment. =
No, I didn't have any problems; the radiation levels are far too low to hav=
e any effect on electronics or optical elements. As contaminated the zone i=
s, I received during my stay a radiation dose of only about 5 microsieverts=
, which is half of what you get at a dental X-ray. I guess if I would have =
entered the sarcophagus, where the radiation is the highest (much, much hig=
her than anywhere else in the zone), there would have been additional noise=
 on my pictures. But radiation diminishes exponentially the farther away yo=
u are from the source, so the effect of what's inside the reactor flats out=
 within a couple of dozen meters or so. The overall background radiation is=
 not high enough to have any immediate effect on people or equipment.

  Ho=
wever, shortly after the accident in 1986, the cleanup crews tried to use r=
emote-controlled robots to get rid of the contaminated graphite pieces on t=
he roof. Those robots broke down after only a few hours, due to the radiati=
on, which was so high it would kill you within only a short time.

  I hope=
 this answers your question,
  Best regards from Switzerland, Timm"

In add=
ition, here are some other sources of info on the subject:

  Effects of Ra=
diation on Electronic Equipment
  http://radlab.nl/radsafe/archives/9602/ms=
g00492.html

  Radiation damage to electronic equipment
  http://www.hps.or=
g/publicinformation/ate/q3172.html

After reading these reports, it seems t=
hey don't really know because it is like saying rocks are brown. Well yeah-=
some rocks are brown, but there are so many rocks in the universe, one can =
hardly make any effective statement at all.

But what I got from it, is tha=
t for an electronic device to be effected, it has to be poorly shielded.

E=
ven the most sensitive equipment us ghost hunters use would probably not be=
 effected. Even in the highest radiation levels at Chernobyl, it isn't high=
 enough to get past the shielding.

    It doesn't reall=

.   It depends on a lot of things: the type and sensitivity of the equipmen=
t; its environment; the types of radiation to which it is exposed; and its =
intensity and duration.  

        As regards chenobyl, there was a lot of =
radioactice material released into the environment, and which still causes =
problems, especially as the material blown into surrounding soils is releas=
ed, even to enter the  foodchain.  While the restricted areas there may be =

         If we're talking about radiation as the transference through space=
 of EMF, then yes it can effect equipment.  The biggest example often cited=
 is the electromagnetic pulse put off by a nuclear blast, that can disable =
electronic equipment.  But even smaller events can do it: satellites have t=
o be protected against certain radiation so their memory isn't zapped, etc.=


                  So it depends on a lot of things: the type and sensitiv=
ity of the equipment; its environment; the types of radiation to which it i=
s exposed; and its intensity and duration.  

                  As a side n=

ctronic components as well.
