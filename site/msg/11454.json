Were &quot;they&quot; like that &quot;before&quot;, or is it a res=\r\nult of messing with something we don&#39;t understand? (not mentioning any name=\r\ns) I would hate to think I made something that got people possessed, or som=\r\nething. Everyone wants the paranormal to fit their beliefs, and the nature =\r\nof the paranormal is to comply. It&#39;s the force, it&#39;s energy, it&#39;ll do what =\r\nyou expect. If ya think it&#39;s demons, it is, if ya think it&#39;s all elves and =\r\nfaeries, that&#39;s what it is, ghosts-yeah that and purple alien girls too! Yo=\r\nu&#39;ll get the irrefruteable evidence to confirm what you think. It&#39;s a level=\r\n of the astral, it&#39;s what ever mind thinks it is. It(life?) can be a trap i=\r\nf ya take it to serious. This--- is a good joke Great Spirit!   That&#39;s my o=\r\npinion, and I&#39;m not stickin&#39; to it. It just doesn&#39;t matter, cuz the rich gu=\r\nys get all the chicks anyway! (from a Chevy Chase movie, I think)    I don&#39;=\r\nt believe in absolutes.  I know something talks, but it defies explanation,=\r\n at least from this level. It&#39;s an intelligence, and I love hearing it, and=\r\n it keeps me intrigued, but I&#39;m not going to put it in a box, saying it&#39;s t=\r\nhis, that, or the other thing.   I don&#39;t do interviews, and few talks cuz I=\r\n don&#39;t know what this is, and I am not going stand up and act like some exp=\r\nert. I think most know my stance, that&#39;s why I never got the invite for TAP=\r\nS-Con. I don&#39;t believe in hauntings--as such, and I publicly contradicted/d=\r\nisaggreed with the TAPS guys at the Stanley back in March.
