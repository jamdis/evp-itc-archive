Most will not be in harmony.\n&gt; Many will take &quot;the dark guys&quot; seriously. Yet, you feel it&#39;s a good\n&gt; idea to let anyone who wants a box have one? All in the name of\n&gt; sharing technology.\n\n\nThere is no such thing as a Harmony meter. There is no such thing as  \na Dark Guy meter, nor an authorized comparative scale for the effects  \nof &quot;Dark Guys&quot; on people who are not &quot;In Harmony.&quot;\n\nHonestly, what does In Harmony actual mean? Okay to play in the club  \nas per Raudive and Technician? How about Edison or Tesla? Or how  \nabout not barking mad? Slightly depressed? Having a bad hair day? Not  \na practicing &quot;fill-in-the-blank?&quot; And who is a Dark Guy? A dead human  \nwith a bad attitude, a hellspawn demon, an alien, or nothing at all  \nexcept the accidental radio broadcast fragment?\n\n&gt; Realize that I\n&gt; am not being selfish- I do not own a box. EVP is my passion and has\n&gt; been from day one 6 years ago when I jumped fully into the field. I am\n&gt; successful in capturing EVP, always have been. I still do it the &quot;old\n&gt; fashioned way&quot; with open air techniques.\n\nDo you have similar concerns about your recorder? Isn&#39;t it also  \ncapable of allowing the Dark Guys to interface with living humans?  \nShouldn&#39;t the technology that was and is freely available to do  \nclassic EVP have been and be vetted by an august body that would  \nstudy potential tapers against EVP&#39;s potential side effects,  \nincluding measuring them on the scale of Dark guys/In Harmony?\n\n&gt; Would I love to be able to\n&gt; hold real time 2 way communications with the other side? Of course.\n&gt; However, I do not think enough research into the possibilities has\n&gt; been done to warrant the approval let alone production of these boxes.\n\nAgain I have to ask: what kind of research and by who?\n\nThere is nothing exotic about the electronics of the box itself. It  \ncan&#39;t *physically* hurt a person more than an a portable radio can--  \nand yearly few people die or are injured at the hands of  their  \nportable radios. What&#39;s left, and what it seems you&#39;re fearful of, is  \npotential psychic injury by the box rather than plain old blunt-force  \ntrauma. I would submit that diagnosing psychic injury is not anymore  \npossible than diagnosing Harmony. And what it comes down to is that  \nthe only people who can make up the body that researches and judges  \nwhether the box should be approved are the very people who are using  \nit right now.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Those of us who have been on countless investigations with many people\n&gt; will quickly admit that there are some people we&#39;d rather not\n&gt; investigate with. When they are present, negative things tend to\n&gt; happen. We all know one or two people who we can say &quot;felt dark&quot; from\n&gt; the first meeting.\n\nSo, you move away from those people because you don&#39;t like their  \nvibe. You drop them from the investigation team or join a new team or  \ninvestigate on your own, don&#39;t you? But you don&#39;t stop investigating  \nall together. Because you have a subjective feeling about someone is  \nnot evidence that they are &quot;dark&quot; and shouldn&#39;t be allowed to have a  \nsimple piece of electronic equipment.\n\n&gt; We all admit that being mentally sound is an\n&gt; important quality in this field. If you have mental issues, this may\n&gt; not be the area of research for you.\n\nWhile I agree with out on this point, it is also wonderfully true of  \nall careers, avocations, and hobbies, not just EVP research. If you  \nare nuts, you are going to act nuts in whatever activity or process  \nyou&#39;re involved in. Unless your behavior crosses the line to  \ncriminal, the rest of us have to deal with you in the traditional  \naway--avoidance. The only way that an out-of-Harmony type person can  \nhurt anyone else with a box is to hit them over the head with it,  \nelectrocute them with it, scare them with it, or attempt somehow to  \ngain sway over them with it. All that they can do to themselves by  \nusing it is hit themselves over the head with it, electrocute  \nthemselves with it, scare themselves with it, or use it to bolster  \nwhatever neuroses or psychopathies they have. And while that is  \nunfortunate, it is also true of everything from revival meetings to  \nhousehold appliances.\n\n\n&gt; We don&#39;t bring children on\n&gt; investigations for obvious reasons. BUT! If you want a box that could\n&gt; possibly open up a portal and bridge the gap between here and the\n&gt; dark, sure! Anyone who wants one should have it!\n\nWait--how do you know that when you use the box it opens a  \n&quot;portal&quot; (implying that something can come through into the physical  \nspace where you are located) versus simply communicate over an  \nelectronic device that tunes into frequencies that other phones  \ncan&#39;t? I&#39;ve seen absolutely no evidence that anything can slither  \nthrough open cassette, reel-to-reel, digital, or box-induced doorways  \nto torment us. The person on the other end of a phone conversation,  \nno matter how evil, cannot undulate his way through the fiber optics  \nto axe murder us. We know that and we simply hang up and cut off the  \nconversation. If he calls back, we hang up again. While sometimes we  \nget EVPs that are rude, nasty, or mean, I think that 30 years of  \nresearch has shown us that whoever said, &quot;Screw you,&quot; on your tape  \nrecorder is not also capable of slashing your tires. All they can do  \nis frighten you. That may be unpleasant, but it is this internal  \nbiochemical process of your own body that leaves most lingering  \neffects, HMO.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; You might feel that I am over reacting or being overly dramatic.\n&gt; That&#39;s fine. My concern is not what you think of me but that you\n&gt; consider the possibilities here. Many of which we do not know. Can you\n&gt; be 100% sure that this is a good idea or that it&#39;s worthy of saying\n&gt; &quot;well, we&#39;ll see what happens&quot;?\n\nThe question that I have for you is have you considered the enormous  \namount of good that comes from use of the box or any EVP technique?  \nFor every person who scares herself silly there at least a dozen, in  \nmy opinion, who lose their fear of death. For every person who goes  \non a power trip because they can contact spirits, there are a dozen  \nwho share messages of hope all comers. The subjective evidence for  \npositive outcome outweighs the subjective evidence for negative  \noutcomes.\n\nHMO and YMMV,\n\nAnn"}
