<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for the feedback Frank you have a good ear for these messages. Tried something different tonight. I have a small tesla coil in the basement that I can run powered mainly by audio (music). This creates broadband noise on both AM and FM bands on my upstairs tuner. his is a capture doing a sweep tuning of the FM band while the Tesla coil was running. 
&quot;We heard along from Tesla that one human&#x27;s going to be testing&quot;

The chatter indicates the message is coming from a control point in London!

I don&#x27;t know, could be, to me it sounds like &quot;Our Chris-he is giving our 
reception&quot;, like maybe they are trying to say Chris is getting these guys.

&gt;Frank, I got this tonight and it sounds like the same voice swept through 
&gt;several station channels. Could they be talking about the Christopher who 
&gt;uses one of your boxes?
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Our Chris.....Is giving a reception&quot;

&gt; &gt; WOW!! I am amazed that someonme actually tried this! It does work.
&gt;There was
&gt; &gt; a Danish(I think) researcher doing the same thing, but never could
&gt;make
&gt; &gt; contact with them. I have done this myself, and it can work wiht TV
&gt;too, if
&gt; &gt; you can switch channels fast ennough. I think you could use a
&gt;steeper motor
&gt; &gt; controler to randomly turn a stepper moter, to turn the dial.
&gt;Manually
&gt; &gt; spinning the dial has one advantage, the sound is clearer! I have
&gt;yet to see
&gt; &gt; a method of ITC that produces better results that the random tuning
&gt;methods.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I have a very sensitive old AM tuner with a flywheel tuning
&gt;system. I tried
&gt; &gt; &gt;several recording sessions manually sweeping the tuner through the
&gt;AM band
&gt; &gt; &gt;late at night. I got pretty good at keeping the dial moving at a
&gt;constant
&gt; &gt; &gt;rate of speed. This is not nearly as good as Frank&#x27;s &#x27;hands off&#x27;
&gt;random
&gt; &gt; &gt;tuning method but it still produced some results. What impressed
&gt;me most is
&gt; &gt; &gt;that some of the voices sound the same, even though I tuned
&gt;through several
&gt; &gt; &gt;channels. This attached capture could be a technical message.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Plug a million hertz&quot;   One Million Hertz = 1mhz = 1000khz, which
&gt;is close
&gt; &gt; &gt;the center frequency for the AM broadcast band.
