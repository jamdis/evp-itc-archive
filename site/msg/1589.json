Your response to my post to frank for a box was not \nbegging but I believe that your obvious attempt at ass kissing is \nmore insulting to frank than my asking for a box. it seems to me that \nyou are afraid that I may get a box before you do and that for some \nreason you deserve one more than anyone else. I don&#39;t understand that \nbeing you already ripped off franks design and had some one build you \na number of boxes on your own. As far as serious evp research goes I \nhave dedicated many many hours, much more than you have I&#39;m sure to \nevp research and other forms of itc. matter of fact if anyone takes a \nlook at your site the couple of dust orb pictures you have and the \nonly evps I have heard are recent ones gleaned from the boxes you had \nmade do not make you a dedicated seasoned pro at PI. I also remember \nnot long ago you contacting me for advice and asking to join my team \nso in some way you must have recognised my professionalism. I will \nend by saying, If you want a box from frank be honest and ask like I \ndid instead of trying to cuddle up next to him with your own version \nof his box and make it like you care about his feelings or protecting \nhim from any annoyances. who made you the frank police anyway. steve \njust be real lets all work together and help each other do not try to \nsabotage anyone else hoping to further your own ambitions, you work \nwith auto parts all day while I am doing evp research so you tell me \nwho is more qualified to work with the box me or you?\n\nI hope I didn&#39;t piss anybody off this is just my opinion!\n\nbruce"}
