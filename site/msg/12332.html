<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I considered doing that but its a very long list and I don&#x27;t know if
the guy that built the Ovilus would approve of the list being posted
without permission.

&gt; Why don&#x27;t you just post the list for the whole group?

&gt; The software that came with my ovilus has a list on it. I can email

&gt; 
&gt; How much have you used your Ovilus? Have you used it enough to get
&gt; anywhere near hearing all of the supposed 512 words?

&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t get the name Seth from my Ovilis. Where did
&gt; &gt; You get a list of words the Ovilus use?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m new here, but have been into paranormal research for 6 years
now.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am the type of person that never gets EVP voices with a
recorder so
&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought I would experiment with things like the Frank&#x27;s box and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ovilus. I recently got the ovilus and brought it to a cemetery and
&gt; &gt; &gt; field where a church burned down many years ago. I can not get too
&gt; &gt; &gt; specific without having people thinking I am making stuff up but it
&gt; &gt; &gt; got fairly wild towards the end of the session. For most of the time
&gt; &gt; &gt; we were there the Ovilus seemed to be spitting out a lot of random
&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff but it kept mentioning the name Seth. After we moved over
to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; field where the church was, the ovilus got a lot more active and
&gt; &gt; &gt; started saying relevant words like cross and priest. The Ovilus was
&gt; &gt; &gt; MUCH more active when being used by our female member. Towards
the end
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Ovilus said I am Seth, and the woman that was with me told Seth
&gt; &gt; &gt; that she did not want to talk to you I&#x27;ve heard bad things about
you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; After that the Ovilus said rather nasty things to her and she
started
&gt; &gt; &gt; feeling nauseous and she ripped the headphones off her head.
Needless
&gt; &gt; &gt; to say we ended the session and got out of there.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Over the course of our investigation we found that the Ovilus was
&gt; &gt; &gt; saying many words that are not on the 500 word list, so yesterday I
&gt; &gt; &gt; did some test recordings to see what words would come up and one of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the first things that came up was: seth blamed rest I am not
&gt; &gt; &gt; gare demon (all in that order). Needless to say this has me
&gt; &gt; &gt; concerned that whatever seth is is still with the box so I am
not even
&gt; &gt; &gt; storing this thing inside of my house. I have an MP3 of the ovilus
&gt; &gt; &gt; saying this.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also from my experience about 50% of the words it is saying
aren&#x27;t on
&gt; &gt; &gt; the list. Chris Fleming has been getting words not on the list, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Barry FitzGerald has stated that just over 50% of the words he is
&gt; &gt; &gt; getting are not on the list. Is there really a much larger list than
&gt; &gt; &gt; advertised or is this thing really magic? Highly doubtful IMO.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; My most important question is is anyone else getting the name
Seth out
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the Ovilus? How many people use this device here?
