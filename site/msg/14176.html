Another thing:

I recently found this out. When you email a file, if it is =
not saved as a compressed format, the email filtering process will actually=
 compress the file automatically.

So even if you have attached a wav. file=
, it will loose resolution over the email process. It will not sound exactl=
y the same as the original wav. file. How much it differs depends on the si=
ze of the file you are attaching. If it is a very large file, it will sound=
 much different.

The only exception to this is if the wav. file is small e=
nough that the filtering process will ignore it. It has to be pretty small =
though, like under 1 MB (I am not exactly sure of the threshold).

The best=
 way to share files over the internet if you want them as close to the orig=
inal as possible is to upload them directly to a website.

       Pixelization doesn't clean-up the data: it replaces it.  Imagine tak=
ing a picture of a field of flowers, and beginning to add levels or pixeliz=
ation to the picture.  Soon, you would not be able to tell there were flowe=
rs there at all.  You would see a lot of colored blocks.

        Or in the=
 other direction, imagine you are looking at a competely randomize bunch of=
 pixes on your screen: a complete screen of truely random static snow.  Pix=
elizing this, after a while, you would again start to see colored blocks.

=
        What's happening is that it is processing an area of the image, tak=
ing (for instance) the average value of that entire area, and replacing all=
 the blocks in that area with the average.  In video processing, this would=
 result in a field of multi-colored flowers being replaced by, for instance=
, a big greyish-bluish block, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the noise=
 example, it maybe replace all the random pixels with another big greyish-b=
luish block.  If you did not know beforehand what the original picture was,=
 you couldn't tell whether your pixelized image was really a field of flowe=
rs, a chevy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.

        It =
works the same with the sound files.  Taking something as complex as speech=
, and replacing frequencies with their averages, loses the speech the farth=
er you go, until you head strange fluctuating square waves.  Doing the same=
 to random static will eventually produce the same thing.  And random fluct=
uating square waves can sound a bit like speech - or at least, you could ha=
ve fun sharing with each other what you thing they 'sound like'.
