And I could suggest they contact you for a setting where you\n&gt; all could get together and develop some tests, do some Q&A (on video so you\n&gt; have proof if they blow you off or cheat) so that you can be absolutely\n&gt; assured of that input?\n&gt;\n&gt; Pardon me if I am reading your email incorrectly though.

It&#39;s Rocky Mountain Paranormal, the same jerkweeds that set up the\n&gt; thing with Skepdork, and her &quot;experts&quot; that are analzying the box I I gave\n&gt; to them. Rocky Mountain Paranormal has never aknowledged a single e-mail\n&gt; from me, even though we&#39;re freaking neighbors. Nor have they ever asked me\n&gt; anything about the boxes, same as all the self proclaimed paranormal experts\n&gt; out there on every god damn site in the world. Rocky Mountain Paranormal\n&gt; refuses all input from me, yet will beat my up the boxes, I have Cds of past\n&gt; shows with these clowns. People wonder why I&#39;m pissed and fed up with\n&gt; everything in this field, it&#39;s all a bunch of ego postering babies chasing\n&gt; radio and TV shows, nothing else!\n&gt;\n&gt; AND why the damn Horror BS, all focusing on fear--cuz these freaking\n&gt; pre-adolesent dweebs in the paranormal can&#39;t get past Hollywood and Friday\n&gt; the 13th movies.
