THANK YOU!! I can actually UNDERSTAND a ghost box now!! Hahaha :) \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Years ago there was a couple doing EVP research in Europe, and they claimed\n&gt; the higher spirits connected their equipment to ours. In EVPmaker they used\n&gt; to talk about the cable connection. I&#39;m wondering if since I don&#39;t use one\n&gt; box, or the computer consistently, I either don&#39;t have that connection, or I\n&gt; get something/someone else connected, so I get crapola voices and\n&gt; predictions. The couple are the ones Macy used to work with, something like\n&gt; Harsh and Fischback--probably obliterating the names though. What if others\n&gt; sporadic, or lying EVPs come from this lack of/or broken connection? So far\n&gt; these lower voices are not worth the trouble, and any information is\n&gt; useless.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I think I&#39;ll try having a box that is always left in the same spot.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;"}
