Hi Judy,
 
The reason it sounds like a room full of people talking real fa=
st is, the box is made to sweep the dial and when it does that it sweeps th=
rough
all the radio stations it's picking up, hence the room full of people=
 sound. As for the speed of the sounds, it has to sweep fast enough so that=
 it does not predominantly catch any whole words or phrases of radio broadc=
ast that can be mistaken for spirit communication. And the theory is that t=
he spirit will use the small broken up fragments of speech to form complete=
 words.
If the box scanned any slower and was picking up full words from th=
e radio the spirit would have to try and change a completely formed word fr=
om what it is to what they want it to be. In my opinion I do not think they=
 have the ability to do that.
 
The messages you are catching in real time =
are sent on an exceptionally good signal that the spirit has caught that wi=
ll make the message or word being sent, stronger and clearer therefore easi=
er to be heard in real time.
 
You also need to do sessions on a regular ba=
sis in order to develop an ear for hearing and separating the spirit commun=
ication from the radio signal junk. It's kind of like a guitar player, when=
 he first starts he can not tune his guitar adequetly due to the lack of ha=
ving an ear for what it sounds like. The more he plays and the more experie=
nced he gets his ear attunes itself to hearing what the correct notes are a=
nd he has no problem tuning his guitar.
 
Give it time and experience and y=
ou ability to hear real time communication will advance. 
 
Also I would in=
vest in a digital recorder, Olympus makes a fine recorder that plugs direct=
ly into your computers USB port to upload your recording.
It is much more b=
eneficial and you will hear more messages on the recording than you are cat=
ching now. Due to the fact that the digitization of the recording tends to =
bring out more subtle sounds and make the recording clearer. Also the sophi=
stication of your computers sound card will greatly enhance the quality of =
listening to the recording, and with a simple sound editor you can slow the=
 recording a bit in order to better catch any responses. I use an Olympus w=
s-200 digital handheld recorder, it records in stereo. they also make a ws-=
100 that records in mono and is a bit less expensive. still they are less t=
han 75.00. Well worth the price for the amount of use you will get out of i=
t. You can also get them on ebay even cheaper.
 
I hope this helped.
