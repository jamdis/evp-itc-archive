ect: Re: [EVP-ITC] i just joined
 

=C2=A0 


I saw a very good test done o=
nce on tv and it was shocking to me. =C2=A0The person had 2 cameras at a lo=
cation, a 35mm and a digital.

They took several pictures at the same time =
side by side, the digital had several "Orbs" and the 35mm caught no anomaly=
's at all in any of the pictures.

I believe what could be called an "Orb" =
for the most part can be debunked quickly as dust, rain, bugs....etc

At le=
ast 99 percent anyway. =C2=A0I think we have more luck in the field using d=
ifferent types of audio for evidence.

Just my thoughts
