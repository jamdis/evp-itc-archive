The AM is staticy, but the FM sounds ok. I really don&#39;t like this radio model much, the sweep circuit if fine but the radio is iffy for sound quality on AM.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m willing top let this go for cheap to the first person who contacts me about it. No Ebay auction this time, just a straight up sale.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m looking for $75 plus shipping costs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
