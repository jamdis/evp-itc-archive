Perhaps it is a good attitude to keep in the back of my mind, for times when/if it feels as if something is trying to be aggressive towards *us.*  For defense, rather than offense.  Although in your case, it could be described as proactive defense, lol.  Owning them before they own you, lol...\n\nThe guy that we did the first ghost box session with says that he gets the best activity from when he projects a  happy-go-lucky, relaxed and merry attitude.  \n\nI guess use whatever works!\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rick Wegrzyn &lt;rickwegrzyn@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1st off walking into the cem or building I&#39;ll say I&#39;m sorry and have respect to \n&gt; those who passed.Then I&#39;ll ask for the evil spirit who is in charge to show or \n&gt; make their selves known..The provoking gets to the point that I&#39;ll call the evil \n&gt; spirits &quot;Pussy fucks that only can harm those who have passed and hurt the \n&gt; children&quot;..for the facts that we catch childrens evps asking for help...When we \n&gt; got those evps we went in with oils for healing and to keep bad spirits away \n&gt; bought from a store that was straight from jerusilum,where Jesus was born.As \n&gt; soon as we got there and called out for the evil prick who hurts the souls of \n&gt; the kids,we got threating evps,KII was pegging out,along with ice cold spots \n&gt; while it was in the upper 80&#39;s.I find in every cem.we go to there seems to be a \n&gt; strong dark presence thats in charge,that wont let spirits roam free.We&#39;ve NEVER \n&gt; gotten skunked evp wise....When leaving we always demand nobody pass the gate \n&gt; &#39;,no-one is allowed to come with use.We had something follow us as well as our \n&gt; other 2 investigators home.I as well as tme other guy felt sick when \n&gt; leaving.Sick for 6 hours,I pet our cat and felt fine all of asudden..1/2 hour \n&gt; later we thought where the cat,we found her lifeless eyes pouring out like \n&gt; puss.Took care of her and when we woke up all our cabnet doors were open with \n&gt; lights on.Our fellow investigator called with the same at his home.Their dog \n&gt; freak out and killed 1 of their cats..We took the oil and placed crosses over \n&gt; all our doors and commanded that anyting evil leave and be cast out...It \n&gt; worked,something to be aware of....But that dont stop me from telling them I&#39;m \n&gt; the new boss here and you do what I say...Stir&#39;em up.No matter what you hear or \n&gt; see..dont be scared,they feed of it and will attach to that.....\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: Adriana Jones &lt;adrianamjones@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Sat, October 16, 2010 8:28:22 PM\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: O.M.G.\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; aggressive how?
