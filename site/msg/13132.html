<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all, I&#x27;m Richard new to group. I have been interested in these
things for about 5-6 years. Havent done any of my own experiments but
have studied many others results. 

Just an observation. With ITC and EVP it seems the voices and images
are real but almost always the images and voice seem prerecorded, sort
of like something you would see in a movie or magazine or listen to on
the radio, like some sort of imprint in the unseen world rather than a
thinking living entity aware of its surroundings.

This leads me to believe that energy imprints itself into the unseen
world but is not necessarily a living entity. This is especially true
with ITC as i&#x27;ve seen no interaction. However, I&#x27;ve seen some
interaction with evp but never any really meaningful interaction,
maybe a name is mentioned but thats pretty much the extent of it.</pre>
