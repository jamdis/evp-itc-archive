<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, that&#x27;s it! Thanks! I saw it used once, but couldn&#x27;t recall if the name
was mentioned or not.

Sorry, I guess I should&#x27;ve said &quot;Non-Human Entities&quot;? But in my book, if the
entity has bad intentions, it&#x27;s a demon. And we do know that they pretend to
be otherwise until it no longer serves their purpose or they slip up.

Thanks again for the help!

Jeff

Are you talking about the Speakjet?  See the video halfway down this page:

http://www.keyportparanormal.com/ghostboxsamplevideos.html

Also, just a heads up:  I think it&#x27;s kind of frowned upon to call the
entities &quot;demons.&quot;  Even &quot;spirits&quot; can be questioned in some circles, as
there seems to be evidence not all of those we talk to have lived as a human
being on earth.

&gt; Hi group!
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ve just been approved, and can&#x27;t wait to learn more about the EVP field,
&gt; as I&#x27;m very interested in it, and the Paranormal. :-)
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Without getting too OT, I hope, can some kind soul tell me what other
&gt; similar devices there are to this? I recall seeing one such box that a
&gt; spirit/demon communicates with a synthesized voice using only 1 word. I
&gt; think this one will be very helpful to me as well, as I begin my
Paranormal
&gt; research career.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance, and eagerly looking forward to learning from all of
you.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt;
