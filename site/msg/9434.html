If anyone in this group lives near Arkansas you can go dig crystals and get=
 them free. All we had to pay was a digging fee which was, then, just a few=
 dollars. It may of gone up by now. This was in the early 90's when my (fir=
st) wife and I went a couple of times to Hot Springs, Arkansas to dig cryst=
als. At that time I lived in Texas (I am originally from Oklahoma), so it w=
as about a four hour drive from Dallas.

We had a wonderful time and found =
a plethora of beautiful crystals. Even some sizable clusters. The energy of=
 the crystals is very strong when you bring them out of the dirt as they ha=
ve been in Mother Earth their whole lives. They have a rust color appearanc=
e and they have to be soaked in the solution that you use to clean pools. I=
 would say all in all each trip we netted about ten pounds or so of crystal=
s. 


Also, if any of you like to camp there are numerous wonderful state p=
arks in that area that have very nice camping facilities, plus even some ca=
bins and shelters. The lakes there are crystal clear and you can see to the=
 bottom. We found Lake De Grey the most beautiful of the ones in that area =
that we visited.

I hope this helps.

Many Blessings All,
