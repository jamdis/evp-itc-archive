Congrats Ladies!  I wish you both the very best of luck and success!  I can only tell you that I love my Franks Box for there is nothing like it in the world!

          Well, we'll see if number 31 can hold a candle to mini 114. ;) Frank says that 31 is about the size of a mini, and that's good, because I haven't got a lot of space to experiment in.  

  We're all quite excited here--my son, Julie Stoddard, and I. And of course, I am really happy that Frank has vetted and approved me to adopt one of his babies. (I think the Purples made him do it; they've always been sweet on me, right from the start. ;) )
  

  Thanks for always cheering me on, Bruce. You're the toppermost.

Hey Guy's 

I read Frank's post about him shipping you two a Frank's box!

That is just great two more family members, I just want to say 
I wish you guy's the same sucess that we that have Frank's boxes 
have enjoyed.

And I know Chip Coffey is not a member here and I do not know him 
personally, but if someone happens to speak to him, please offer my 
congrats on getting #34, even though all three of you guy's took my 
title a newest box owner. :)

I can't wait to hear the files.
again welcome to the fold.

Bruce
