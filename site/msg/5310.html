<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Actually, it&#x27;s a judgment call.  You will most likely still hear 
fragments of radio, but if i hear nothing i disregard it.  Box 
research is different than traditional EVP, it&#x27;s radio so you either 
hear it or you don&#x27;t.  And as you do it, you will hear the difference 
between radio and spirit voices.  It does take time, but rewarding to 
be able to achieve this type of communication.

&gt; Steve --
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for your reply.  So, if we have 14 min of dead time 
&gt; before &quot;clyde&quot; appears and you edit the 14 mins, is there any other 
&gt; radio band &quot;noise&quot; that appears or is it simply quiet?  Also, can 
you 
&gt; be so sure that deleting these 14 mins that there aren&#x27;t other 
&gt; messages on other frequencies to retrieve?
&gt; 
&gt; Greatly appreciate your opinion on this matter,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; I edit my files to display the answer, i.e---if i ask what is 
your 
&gt; name 
&gt; &gt; and 14 seconds later they say &quot;clyde&quot;.  At that point i will cut 
&gt; out 
&gt; &gt; the 14 seconds of nothing and just leave the answer to my 
&gt; question.  
&gt; &gt; Sometimes i have to make the file a bit louder, but no mods to 
the 
&gt; &gt; actual file.  It is what it is and i leave it in raw format for 
all 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; hear, the less you mess with the files is better to bring people 
&gt; onto 
&gt; &gt; this side of the fence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello All -
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been studying this format of communication for better 
part 
&gt; of 
&gt; &gt; a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; year now.  I have been listening to clips and reading posts 
here 
&gt; for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; sometime and am impressed with direction of your work.  The 
&gt; majority 
&gt; &gt; of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; clips I&#x27;ve listened to, regardless of the type of box used, are 
&gt; quite 
&gt; &gt; &gt; clear.  My question to you is as follows:  are the files edited 
&gt; or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; changed at all or is this the quality they are coming through 
&gt; at?  
&gt; &gt; &gt;
