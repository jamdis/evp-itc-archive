I heard it all as labelled except the \nending.  I heard &quot;you&#39;re lucky&quot; or looking.  Though its the same syllables as &quot;here fluffy&quot; so.. \nwhat ev.   I&#39;m wondering if the people faster comment was for you to speed it up.  They have \nseemed to tell me to speed it up or slow it down and even to boost it.\n\nPeace,\nNick"}
