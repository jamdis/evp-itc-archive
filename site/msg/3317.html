 At the Stanley recently I was surprised with the box use, and what was co=

 and it appears to work differently than what I expected. I also prefer the=
 users speak of what it does. However, I expect a reaction from those that =
would keep this technology a secret to make attempts to show that it's only=
 for a privliged few to use, and "interpret" for the masses. I'm getting hi=
nts of this reaction, and have already shown my hand as to what side I'm on=
. Right now it's the fear of evil spirits being released as an excuse as to=
 why the common person should not use this stuff. That's same reasoning tha=

, channeling, dowsing, automatic writting......you name it.  No, you must p=

I agree. As an author, I am =
attacked all the time for "exploiting" Chicago's haunted history and those =
who have had personal experiences with the paranormal phenomena at the site=
s about which I write. But I have found that it is only one's jealous colle=
agues (or wanna-bes) who complain. Those who are honestly interested in the=
 phenomena and in learning about its meaning in their lives are grateful fo=
r what you do.I am such a shy person, and I loathe the natural attention th=
at comes from what I do. But you have a duty as a researcher to bring your =
findings to those who are interested in them. When you do, the jealous and =
the skeptical will attack you, make no bones about it, and (ironically) the=
y will say first off that you are arrogant and self-serving, and that you l=
ove the limelight. Some people who love attention thrive on that negative a=
ttention; for me it's torture. But I have to deal with it, and so do you!I =
would like very much to have you publicly talk about your research. What go=
od is it if it doesn't help idiots like us figure out how to do our own?:) =
