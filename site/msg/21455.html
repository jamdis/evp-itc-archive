<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have the same problem, seems perfectly clear to me and no one hears it. Very frustrating! Part of it seems to be people ignore what is labeled and try to create their messagwes out of it, as if they somehow know better. I take most of what I get as personal messages, and to hell with others think it really says, that don&#x27;t matter. Part of it is that the brain/hearing is all based on life experience, how one learned, what kind of programming they have now, their own biases and expectations, how the hearing is wired--it&#x27;s complicated!
