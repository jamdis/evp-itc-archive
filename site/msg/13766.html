LOL! I use mine by myself and have for years. I now do automatic writing
(Ouija too slow), and I've never had any issues at all. I do not do anything
before I pick up the board, but I do say goodbye when I'm done. More out of
courtesy (even if it's just to my own mind).

warned us about when playing with the ouija board?
