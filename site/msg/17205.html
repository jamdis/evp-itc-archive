&gt;   I have worked in electronics for over 40 years.  I NEVER went to trade
&gt; school or college.  I taught myself because that&#x27;s how bad I wanted to
&gt; learn.  At a very young age, I went to the library and read everything I
&gt; could find on electronics.  When I ran out of books, I became a ham radio
&gt; operator.  I worked in the aerospace industry in an engineering lab until 10
&gt; years ago, when the government made cuts.  I still get paid for what I know.
&gt;
&gt; My point is that if you want it bad enough, you can do whatever you need to
&gt; do to make it happen.  If Frank can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t build it, from what I&#x27;ve
&gt; seen, he is willing to provide all the information to do it yourself.  If
&gt; you are not willing to put that type of effort into it, find something else
&gt; to occupy your time and efforts.

&gt;  I get requests for boxes, and I think some get offended that I don&#x27;t just
&gt; whip out a box and throw it at them for &quot;their research&quot;. Trouble is,
&gt; there&#x27;s too many whack jobs out there wanting to be the world&#x27;s onlyest box
&gt; expert, or the ones desperately grieving, or lately, religious nuts!
&gt;
&gt;  I&#x27;ve said it over and over and over and over and over and
&gt; over--expectation will create the voices you want to hear. If you are
&gt; seeking Jesus, that is exactly what you are going to get and you&#x27;ll swear
&gt; it&#x27;s God gospel freaking truth, and the rest of us should bow down to you. I
&gt; think y&#x27;all know who I&#x27;m talking about.
&gt;
&gt;  I am uncertain if one can ask for certain spirits, or if even that tends
&gt; to create what one wans. I think maybe it works the same as the above. I
&gt; don&#x27;t ask for any specific spirits/entities, I don&#x27;t ask questions, I just
&gt; let them talk and try not to influance it. If I have question, I might think
&gt; it, and most of the time they&#x27;ll answer, wiht out me asking.  That could be
&gt; just creating want I want to hear as well--don&#x27;t know.
&gt;
&gt;  I don&#x27;t have to be on these groups and I don&#x27;t have make  boxes, except
&gt; for my own use. I think the messages are personal in nature, no one is going
&gt; to hear it the same, and it&#x27;s about worthless as &quot;evidence&quot;. We get enough
&gt; that&#x27;s shareable to show others that it&#x27;s real, and I think that is about
&gt; the best that can be hoped for. I think, and it is only my opinion, that
&gt; &quot;evidence&quot; at so called haunted areas is just what is expected, I really
&gt; don&#x27;t think it proves anything.
&gt;
&gt;  Then, there the bullies that want all this to conform to their wishes, and
&gt; we saw more examples of that with the recent e-bay auction, and y&#x27;all know
&gt; who you are! If no one sells boxes, no one builds boxes, its&#x27; that simple!
&gt; Parts and radios are not free, and why the hell should we be expected to
&gt; spend endless hours on this stuff for nothing!?
&gt;
&gt;  I know, I know --sacrilege! -- I should be banned from all groups and box
&gt; work, burned at the stake, tarred and feathered, run out of town on rail,
&gt; how dare I say anything!?
