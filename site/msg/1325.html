&gt;   I am sorry that you have to experience that but it goes hand in 
hand with what we do. I agree totally with Frank Ratka on this. I 
learned along time ago that I am not doing this for recognition, 
fame, fortune, popularity, or to prove to anyone. Instead I approach 
it as I am the researcher, I am the student, I am learning. 
&gt;    
&gt;   I no longer waste my time talking to people who interfere or have 
a negative approach to the results we all get. I would much rather 
spend my few hours of free time talking to you guys or conducting 
more experiments.
&gt;    
&gt;   I know it can be hard to ignore negativity but if you do not 
ignore it then you yourself can become part of that negativity or be 
consumed by it entirely. So share, but do not react to negative 
feedback...enlighten but do not seek to impress.
&gt;    
&gt;   You are doing fine I see you uploaded a bunch of files I see some 
have personal details...is this proof for Y O U...thats what is 
important. Did they prove to you without a doubt that something 
extraordinary went on during that session. If the answer was yes then 
you know that you are on the right track. Dont let anyone pull you 
off that path or obstruct your moving forward.

&gt;           Bruce,
&gt; 
&gt; The best way to deal with the naysayers is to ignore them. We will
&gt; always have people saying such things and fighting with them only
&gt; negatively effects your own contact field. In the end you will not
&gt; convince them of anything.
&gt; 
&gt; In my case I answer what I think are legitimate questions from 
sincere
&gt; people. Some of those turn out to be the naysayers who want to 
argue,
&gt; I drop the conversation and move on. 
&gt; 
&gt; I look at it this way. If they have to ask how it works then they
&gt; don&#x27;t know and feel enough to understand anything I would have to 
tell
&gt; them. They think it is a completely &quot;technical&quot; process, when the 
most
&gt; important components are the links between the two communicators.
&gt; 
&gt; As Misty and I have talked about in the past I was one who use to 
jump
&gt; at any opportunity to &quot;fight the skeptics&quot;. I have since learned 
that
&gt; it is a pointless waste of energy and it does do damage to your
&gt; contact field or bridge if you have established one. The turmoil and
&gt; negative emotions controversy spawns are not conducive to the types 
of
&gt; communications we have been experimenting with.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of those skeptics genuinely want to learn what we know but just
&gt; can&#x27;t grasp the basics needed to perpetuate this reality. Others 
just
&gt; want to get you worked up and off balance. By ignoring negative
&gt; contacts you are protecting your connection to your higher self. 
Don&#x27;t
&gt; fall for their traps!
&gt; 
&gt; Best Regards,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; hi guy&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; It seems that franks box and the sweep method are not to poular 
with 
&gt; &gt; a few closed minded and self appointed paranormal truth seekers 
in 
&gt; &gt; other words individuals who can not accomplish anything on thier 
own 
&gt; &gt; as far as paranormal research is concerned so they feel they must 
&gt; &gt; lash out at others who open mindedly try new and mostly 
unexplored 
&gt; &gt; methods od spirit communication and investigation. they have no 
basis 
&gt; &gt; for thier attacks but to say I work in the electronics field and 
&gt; &gt; franks box is impossible it can not work and the am sweep is just 
&gt; &gt; catching bits of words that your mind is naturaly putting 
together as 
&gt; &gt; phrases. What I would like them to explain is how the messages 
&gt; &gt; recieved in this manner pertain to my individual life , family 
and 
&gt; &gt; name and how can anyone explain what is so far to my knowledge 
&gt; &gt; unexplainable. Anyway enough venting. This began as a good 
hearted 
&gt; &gt; post on another paranormal forum in hopes of spurring some 
&gt; &gt; researchers like myself that were unaware of these methods to 
maybe 
&gt; &gt; give them a try. I was immediatly attacked like by a pack of 
wolves 
&gt; &gt; claiming to be so called electronic experts and self appointed 
&gt; &gt; debunkers of fraud when all I did was to explain my experience 
with 
&gt; &gt; the method and not to give a fact based report on it&#x27;s validity 
but 
&gt; &gt; to give my personal experience with it. WHY CAN&#x27;T WE ALL JUST GET 
&gt; &gt; ALONG !!!

frank and misty,
Very sound advice and it&#x27;s always the same couple of people that jump 
on any piece of evidence presented. I will heed your advice thank you.
I have endured every assault you could think of about my vpi images 
even being called an outright lier and fake.
If you guy,s would like to check out my vpi images my website 
explains all about them http://free-paranormalinvestigating.com/
