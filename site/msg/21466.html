The "CURSED" video series is an investigation  into the paranormal, the un=
explained, local lore and upholds the preservation of history, culture and =
 architectural landmarks.
 
How it differs from what is already out there:
=
 
Many of the popular Non-Fictional Ghost/Paranormal TV shows (for entertai=
nment purposes) have been glamorized and have producers on board that feel =
they ''have to" present something paranormal to the audience and  have a te=
nancy to add in false items to spice the story up and to mislead the viewer=
s. The reality of the situation is 90% of the time when a "haunted" locatio=
n is  investigated nothing happens. When we visit a location we educate our=
selves prior to the visit concerning the story behind the lore and take it =
into account and attempt to either  confirm or disprove the different stori=
es, and usually there are several different versions of the same legend. Wh=
ether the stories be true or false and regardless of the lore and possible =
tales of hauntings,  we always document what we find thru photos, videos an=
d draft up a report of what may have occurred for public record and for the=
 "CURSED" version of the book. "CURSED" also  is not limited to "ghost hunt=
ing" as many of the current TV shows are, we also believe in preserving our=
 local legends and history. Many of the former Asylums ( and abandoned buil=
dings) are considered an eyesore and a burden to the community, so investor=
s and people with no appreciation for history come in and buy the land up t=
o use for strip malls, super stores or condos. Effectively destroying all t=
he history and lore that might have been associated with the location.
 
Ye=
s it is "fun" to go on urban explorations thru old abandoned buildings and =
landmarks to see what can be found, but it is also important to not deface =
or damage the property like so many prior that vandalize the locations. Res=
pect the location and the neighbors that may be adjacent to the location th=
at you are exploring. Many locations that are visited have strict "No Tresp=
assing" rules put in effect by the local police (or County Sheriff) due to =
many "troublemakers" flocking to the areas after hearing about it from popu=
lar magazines or TV shows, and sometimes that does ruin it for the investig=
ators that are there simply to observe and document the place before it get=
s torn down by modern convenience.
 
Our primary scope of location is South=
ern New Jersey since that is where we are based out of, but we have been in=
vited and will also document other locations. We are not limited by geograp=
hical constraints.
