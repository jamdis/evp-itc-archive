Its easy to wonder about possible interaction\nwith the Box from anywhere. Different people receiving personal\nmessages simultaneously is something I&#39;ve already observed in sessions\nwhere you have multiple people present. It will be interesting to run\na box session on the network for a specified time and have listeners\npost the messages they heard on the forum so results can be compared.\n\n-Bill \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot;\n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Piece of cake! The boxes are pretty much ready, it requires only \n&gt; &gt; connecting the box line out to the sound card input, and sending \n&gt; out \n&gt; &gt; over the internet, which I have no idea how to do the soft ware \n&gt; &gt; part, but the guy that suggested seems to. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;m sure that people in different locations would get different \n&gt; &gt; messages although, presumalby, the box was outputing only a single \n&gt; &gt; stream of information. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  This is something to be excited about. It could be just weeks away.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Travis&quot; &lt;vampire2kd@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thats an awesome idea. imagine though its streaming live across \n&gt; &gt; cables\n&gt; &gt; &gt; throughout the states. The possibility of the audio being further\n&gt; &gt; &gt; influenced is greater Im sure. Reminds me of when a radio show was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; being done on evps people recording the show played it back later \n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; listen again and heard messages to them during the play back and \n&gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was being reported from tons of people. So its pretty interesting \n&gt; &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you can actually have this done, cant wait to see what happens.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s like DAH!!! Why I not think about this!? Setup an internet \n&gt; &gt; server \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (somehow) and connect a box to the internet to run 24/7----\n&gt; LIVE. \n&gt; &gt; Or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; make \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coordinated short tests so remote reception can be compared to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; local. It \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be an easy task to make modes and bands switchable \n&gt; &gt; remotely as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; well. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What about multiple boxes?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just imagine, a box accessible to the world 24 hours a day, \n&gt; seven\n&gt; &gt; &gt; days a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; week! It staggers the imagination! Given the nature of the \n&gt; &gt; voices and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contacts, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if several people could \n&gt; access \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; system \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at the exact same time, yet all receive personal communications.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Guess that would create wee ripple in the darkside!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wasn&#39;t sure if the originator of the idea wanted his name out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there, I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; took it off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;To: &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Guess they want it shared!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 02 Aug 2007 05:56:16 -0000\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-\n&gt; &gt; boxes@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There&#39;s no way I can stop making boxes, I just don&#39;t have \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;resuources to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supply them to everyone that wants at this time, plus \n&gt; trying \n&gt; &gt; ot find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;waay to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make the things more better.

Leaning on the non-\n&gt; locality \n&gt; &gt; theory.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Couple things I&#39;m wondering about, assuming it works:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;- Would the box work &quot;better&quot; physically present at a &quot;high \n&gt; &gt; energy&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;location?  I&#39;m refering to locations on Earth that are known \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;high energy from lay lines, etc. &quot;portals&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;- Will the recorded audio from your box be the same recorded \n&gt; or \n&gt; &gt; heard\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;audio at the remote location?  Meaning will the EVP be \n&gt; &gt; recordable at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;your location or only the remote users location?  Or if both, \n&gt; &gt; will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;they match?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Just some things I&#39;ve been thinking about lately.
