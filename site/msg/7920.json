I tried to upload the unpacked\n.exe file to the Files section, but Yahoo complained it was too big. :-(\n\nSo I uploaded it to a free file hoster:\nhttp://www.freevix.org/data/12650/10698/evp_assistant_v1.exe\n\nYou might also want to try EVPmaker:\nhttp://www.stefanbion.de/evpmaker/index_e.htm\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Hi stefan I checked out the evpuk site but can&#39;t get the download. Not\n&gt; sure of the unzip process but I think I should be able to handle the\n&gt; download at my end. Any other options. I am in Mexico and can&#39;t seem\n&gt; to get reliable radio signals with my RS hacks. Maype a computer based\n&gt; program like evpuk might be my best option. Ron l"}
