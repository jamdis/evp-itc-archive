<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You do make a good point, but you&#x27;re looking for the unlikely answer being of a skeptical nature.  I just know it was in response to my question immediately after i asked it.  My version of what i hear would make more sense to my question then what you possibly heard.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for that specifically to come through, i just posted what i thought i heard.  I do believe that there is something going on here other than just random words relating to our questions.  I appreciate you taking the time to offer your opinion, that&#x27;s what makes this field good.  Getting alternate ideas and not receiving stuff as fact, i&#x27;m on board with that.

Thanx for listening,
-Steve H.

&gt; In my opinion, I think it&#x27;s a classic example of  putting yourself in the context of looking to hear something, and then hearing what you want, and not considering the other possibilities.
&gt; 
&gt; The answers &quot;Sweet Love&quot; and &quot;Shirt&quot; are just as easy to hear.

&gt; I asked a specific question about the latest box i&#x27;m building.  My 
&gt; question was simple and to the point &quot;Is it the board or the radio that&#x27;s 
&gt; causing the problem?&quot;
&gt;  
&gt; The answer came seconds after asking it.  It was an intelligent 
&gt; response to my question.  I would like for someone to comment of this with 
&gt; the explanation of how they did that.  I just know they speak to me and i 
&gt; don&#x27;t know how they do it.  There is still so much to learn about this 
&gt; field.
