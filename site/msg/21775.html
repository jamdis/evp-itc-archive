Very sorry about this one file, I will try to shorten the file name  again, 
so it will play, you just got to read back as to what it is saying.   Which 
says, "Amy, she just got in, and she cried" " a pretty girl" "crossing  
over she cried, Jesus want her to cross."  And the other says,  "Amy,  somebody 
loves you."  She must have died feeling unloved.   sf
