LOL.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I love it that she tattled on the dog. Rofl.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you have a website, I would love to see your ITC photos of \nanimals.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is so awesome. I feel that our family and friends take \ncare of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our pet babies when they go to the Other Side.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My friend that came through on the EVP on Sunday was such a \nwonderful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; woman. She loved animals like I do. She owned a Bakery and \nlived\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; across the street from me for years. The dog that my first \nwife and I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had at that time was a Scottish Terrier named Abbra (Her \nofficial name\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was Aberdeen, as in the Scottish town) anyway, I used to hear \nJean\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking and I would look out the window and there she would \nbe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sneaking snacks to Miss Abbra who needed bakery snacks about \nlike I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. LOL. Thats when we figured out why Miss Abbra wasn&#39;t \nlosing weight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on her new diet. LOL.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blessings All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jeremy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Okie in New York :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; \n&lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s awesome, Jeremy.  I have some EVP of a woman talking \nto my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dog.  One time when I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was recording, my dog (Kindred) started barking.  When I \nlistened\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back to the session (this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was tradition EVP done in silence with a digital recorder) \nshe had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said, &quot;Kindred.  What was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that?&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In another, Kindred barks, then the woman says, &quot;Kindred.  \nShe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinks you&#39;re sleeping.&quot;  I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also have one of someone telling her &quot;NO&quot; and I really like \nthe one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where someone tattles \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on her to me, &quot;Kindred&#39;s headed for the dumpster.&quot;  LOL.  \nJust goes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to show you they are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not only keeping an eye on us, but the animals too.  I \nthink it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great that sometimes they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are talking directly to the dog.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I only have one involving my cat, Kizmyt, where someone \nsays, &quot;Stay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back&quot; (the cat had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come into the room as I was recording).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have gotten many ITC images of animals, so clearly they \nare an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important part of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirit realm.  :-)  As well, I had animals come through \nduring\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting with a medium.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for sharing about your Molly EVP!
