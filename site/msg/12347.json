I recently got the ovilus and =\r\nbrought it to a \ncemetery \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field where a church burned down m=\r\nany years ago. I can not \nget \n&gt; too\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific without having people=\r\n thinking I am making stuff up \n&gt; but it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got fairly wild towards th=\r\ne end of the session. For most of \nthe \n&gt; time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we were there the Ov=\r\nilus seemed to be spitting out a lot of \n&gt; random\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff but it kept=\r\n mentioning the name Seth. After we moved \nover \n&gt; to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field whe=\r\nre the church was, the ovilus got a lot more active \nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started sa=\r\nying relevant words like cross and priest. The \nOvilus \n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MUCH =\r\nmore active when being used by our female member. \nTowards \n&gt; the end\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; the Ovilus said I am Seth, and the woman that was with me \ntold \n&gt; Seth\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that she did not want to talk to you I&#39;ve heard bad things \n&gt; about=\r\n you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After that the Ovilus said rather nasty things to her and she=\r\n \n&gt; started\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feeling nauseous and she ripped the headphones off her =\r\nhead. \n&gt; Needless\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to say we ended the session and got out of there.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Over the course of our investigation we found that the Ovi=\r\nlus \n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saying many words that are not on the 500 word list, so =\r\n\n&gt; yesterday I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did some test recordings to see what words would com=\r\ne up and \n&gt; one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the first things that came up was: seth blamed r=\r\nest I am not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gare demon (all in that order). Needless to say this h=\r\nas me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concerned that whatever seth is is still with the box so I am=\r\n \n&gt; not even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; storing this thing inside of my house. I have an MP3 o=\r\nf the \n&gt; ovilus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saying this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also from my experienc=\r\ne about 50% of the words it is saying \n&gt; aren&#39;t on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the list. Chris =\r\nFleming has been getting words not on the \nlist, \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Barry FitzG=\r\nerald has stated that just over 50% of the words \nhe \n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; getting =\r\nare not on the list. Is there really a much larger \nlist \n&gt; than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ad=\r\nvertised or is this thing really magic? Highly doubtful IMO.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; My most important question is is anyone else getting the name \n&gt; Seth out=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the Ovilus?

I also&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; have had&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; my puck give words that are not on the list.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Carol B.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new here, but have been into paranormal research for 6 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; years now.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am the type of person that never gets EVP voices with a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; recorder so&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I thought I would experiment with things like the Frank&#39;s box &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ovilus. I recently got the ovilus and brought it to a &lt;BR&gt;cemetery &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field where a church burned down many years ago. I can not &lt;BR&gt;get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; too&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific without having people thinking I am making stuff up &lt;BR&gt;&gt; but it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got fairly wild towards the end of the session. For most of &lt;BR&gt;the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; time&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we were there the Ovilus seemed to be spitting out a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; random&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff but it kept mentioning the name Seth. After we moved &lt;BR&gt;over &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to\n the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field where the church was, the ovilus got a lot more active &lt;BR&gt;and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started saying relevant words like cross and priest. The &lt;BR&gt;Ovilus &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MUCH more active when being used by our female member. &lt;BR&gt;Towards &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the end&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Ovilus said I am Seth, and the woman that was with me &lt;BR&gt;told &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Seth&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that she did not want to talk to you I&#39;ve heard bad things &lt;BR&gt;&gt; about you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After that the Ovilus said rather nasty things to her and she &lt;BR&gt;&gt; started&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feeling nauseous and she ripped the headphones off her head. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Needless&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to say we ended the session and got out of there.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Over the course of our investigation we found that the Ovilus &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saying many words that are not on\n the 500 word list, so &lt;BR&gt;&gt; yesterday I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did some test recordings to see what words would come up and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the first things that came up was: seth blamed rest I am not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gare demon (all in that order). Needless to say this has me&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concerned that whatever seth is is still with the box so I am &lt;BR&gt;&gt; not even&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; storing this thing inside of my house. I have an MP3 of the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ovilus&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saying this.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also from my experience about 50% of the words it is saying &lt;BR&gt;&gt; aren&#39;t on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the list. Chris Fleming has been getting words not on the &lt;BR&gt;list, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Barry FitzGerald has stated that just over 50% of the words &lt;BR&gt;he &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; getting are not on the list. Is there really a much larger\n &lt;BR&gt;list &lt;BR&gt;&gt; than&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advertised or is this thing really magic? Highly doubtful IMO.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My most important question is is anyone else getting the name &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Seth out&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the Ovilus? How many people use this device here?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-1387680483-1223067348=:14931--"}
