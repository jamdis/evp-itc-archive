You can also use your pc microphone and software like audacity to record which is free if you already have a mic. If not they are pretty inexpensive to purchase. You can also experiment with free methods such as evpmaker, sweep tuning a radio, recording white noise, recording silence (ambient noise), running water, and you could modify a radio at little expense to you to make a shack hack or other simulation of a franks box.\n\nSome websites to help you\nhttp://www.stefanbion.de/evpmaker/index_e.htm\nhttp://audacity.sourceforge.net/\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com\nhttp://www.keyportparanormal.com\nhttp://frank.xm.com\nhttp://misty.xm.com\n\nGood Luck!\nMisty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;blueeyedwolf1977&quot; &lt;sellington3629@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all! I have been a member of this group for a little while now, and I finally have a question..lol..\n&gt; \n&gt; I have always been interested in EVP work, but have never really had the opportunity to &quot;try for myself&quot;...I am soo far from mechanically inclined it isn&#39;t funny, and don&#39;t have alot of money to spend...\n&gt; \n&gt; Are there any suggestions on what I can do to start out maybe? Something cheap? That is easy to use? I have an old &#39;Realistic&#39;\n&gt; cassette recorder with variable speech control ( pitch and speed controls)...is this anything that I can experiment with? Will it work (even for now until I can afford something better? lol)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance all!!\n&gt;"}
