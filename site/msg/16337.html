Hertz measures frequency in cycles per second.=C2=A0 Not strength.
And it c=
an be used to measure the frequency of anything (for example, sound), not j=
ust EMF.

Gauss is more complicated.=C2=A0 It seems to be the saturation or=
 density of magnetic flux, which relates to the strength of a magnetic fiel=
d, which relates to the strength of EMF.

Or something like that.

Recently someone ask=
ed me the following 
question:
=C2=A0
[I am brand new to the world of paran=
ormal investigation. I believe I 
have a good grasp on what hertz and gauss=
 measurments are, however am confused 
as to all of the differences between=
 them. Hertz has more to do with the 
complete cycles per second and gauss =
is the strength of an EMF. I guess where I 
am fuzzy is in my lack of physi=
cs. I thought frequency is also a measurment of 
strength. I may not be mak=
ing much sense here, but can you tell me where I am 
missing somthing?]
=C2=
=A0
My answer was that I wasn't entirely sure 
myself but I think=C2=A0that=
=C2=A0Hertz measures the wave frequencies of the 
entire electromagnetic sp=
ectrum. Gauss only measures the intensity or strength 
of=C2=A0EMF generate=
d around these wave frequencies. Depending on=C2=A0the range 
of hertz, an =
EMF is generated.
=C2=A0
I told him that I would check around with 
other p=
eople in the field to make sure.
=C2=A0
Was I correct?
=C2=A0
Thanks!
