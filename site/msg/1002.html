<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>i put a photo in my ablum in photo section of raygun rf detector

2 transistor superregen works ok with test detectors between stages.

there arent many materials left to test.  when i think of a new one i 
plug it in.  this was a diamond saw blade and slightly corroded steel 
clamp.

instantly overloaded by numerous voices speaking a form of english with 
too many new words and phraseology for me to comprehend. lasted 2 or 
three minutes then i tried to sneak the tape recorder in. that killed it.

when i try a new setup i think i set it up on unconscious cues per 
prevailing conditions.  it works first time, every time, but thats 
usually it for awhile.

so far conditioned 1n34 and tungsten carbide against germanium are most 
reliable.

my taping efforts WITH radio suck.  recorder seems to load circuit even 
with no direct connection.  recording without receiver-same nonsensical 
stuff as usual</pre>
