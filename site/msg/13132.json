I have been interested in these\nthings for about 5-6 years. Havent done any of my own experiments but\nhave studied many others results. \n\nJust an observation. With ITC and EVP it seems the voices and images\nare real but almost always the images and voice seem prerecorded, sort\nof like something you would see in a movie or magazine or listen to on\nthe radio, like some sort of imprint in the unseen world rather than a\nthinking living entity aware of its surroundings.\n\nThis leads me to believe that energy imprints itself into the unseen\nworld but is not necessarily a living entity. This is especially true\nwith ITC as i&#39;ve seen no interaction. However, I&#39;ve seen some\ninteraction with evp but never any really meaningful interaction,\nmaybe a name is mentioned but thats pretty much the extent of it."}
