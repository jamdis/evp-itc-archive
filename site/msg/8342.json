To achieve this, the output\nof a radio which is tuned to &quot;white noise&quot; (or hiss) can be connected to\nthe input of the soundcard, and in EVPmaker the option &quot;Extras &gt; Random\nSource &gt; Sound card&quot; can be selected to make the program read the\nnoise signal from the radio and use it as a source for random numbers.\nPerhaps it&#39;s easier for the &quot;guys&quot; (& gals) to influence the radio in\norder to send us their messages. Who knows...?\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Hey guy&#39;s,\n\n&gt; I think we may be on to something here.\n&gt; I think this method has a huge amount of poential.\n&gt; It was just a matter of time before someone hit on the correct file to \n&gt; use with that program.\n\n&gt; Bruce"}
