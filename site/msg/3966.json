It seems to more I listen, the more I find...\n\nHas anyone been brave enough to give ear to the ones I&#39;ve posted so \nfar?\n\nThanks,\nLance\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Lance Oliver&quot; &lt;orbhunterx@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Good Evening!\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been very busy today going through a long, intense audio \n&gt; recording taken at the Gainesville, Texas house, which my team \n&gt; investigated on Sunday, November 25th.\n&gt; \n&gt; All of the EVPs I just posted were gathered in the unoccupied \n&gt; upstairs bedroom. Only three investigators were present in the \nroom. \n&gt; Their voices have been properly taken into account and ruled out as \n&gt; sources of the actual EVPs. \n&gt; \n&gt; The new and resampled EVPs have been saved as .mp3 files. They can \nbe \n&gt; freely downloaded from the site here -\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.filecrunch.com/user/orbhunterx\n&gt; \n&gt; You will hear quite a few odd words, dog barks, and even mimicry. \n&gt; Some of the voices are faint and whispery. Other EVP voices sound \n&gt; like the invisibles are standing right along side the researchers!\n&gt; \n&gt; Sexual Content Warning:\n&gt; \n&gt; Several of the EVPs have strong sexual content. \n&gt; \n&gt; Please read the file name prior to downloading.\n&gt; \n&gt; Listening to the EVPs will be at your own disgression.\n&gt; \n&gt; That stated, those that choose to listen to the EVPs, please let me \n&gt; know if any of them need further contextual clarification. I look \n&gt; forward to hearing feedback. As it stands, the true nature of \nwhat&#39;s \n&gt; going on in the house awaits much more serious attention. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; Lance Oliver, Founder\n&gt; Denton Area Paranormal Society\n&gt;"}
