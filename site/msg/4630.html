<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>If you ever saw the series SciFi Investigates, which briefly ran
earlier this year, you may have seen the episode with Mark. This
series focuses on debunking claims of the paranormal, whether it was
the reported crash of a ufo in the desert (the 1951 Roswell
incident)or the existence of the afterlife. Well, the show with Mark
was the only one I remember where they couldn&#x27;t logically explain how
the double image photos were forming.

And that is an issue we face when we present Box recordings.
Non-believers try to explain away the recordings by applying standard
scientific based arguments. They say we&#x27;re hearing broadcast
fragments, or it&#x27;s just matrixing, whatever. But even though we use
readily available technology to build the Box, the results that are
achieved go beyond conventional science. We don&#x27;t yet understand how
it is working, but it is. As you use the Box, any version of it, you
will discover that certain messages intended for the operator come
through more frequently.

&gt; As far as I know, Mark has been focusing on lecturing with his
Luminator machine, and that is how he is bringing the ITC message to
the public.
&gt;   Mark says that not even Mark really knows how it works, but the
Luminator apparently recycles air through liquid-filled coils to sort
of change the molecular structure of the atoms--I think!:)  This gives
discarnate entities just enough mass to be photographed.
&gt;   As a result, photographs taken of people in a room where the
luminator is running often show spirit faces superimposed over the
faces of the living subjects.  You can read more in Mark&#x27;s book,
&quot;Spirit Faces.&quot;
&gt;   I don&#x27;t think Mark is a member of any experimental forums; but I
would say, invite him!  He just might join!

&gt;           Wow, I&#x27;m loving all this information, it&#x27;s giving me a lot
of ideas. Very exciting for me!  
&gt; 
&gt;   Does Mark Macy belong to this forum too? I met him about 3 years
ago. My husband is a commercial photographer and Mark asked him to do
his portrait for a book he was coming out with. He came to our home
studio for the portrait, and I got to talk with him a little about
what he does. At that time all I knew of EVP was from the White Noise
movie, wasn&#x27;t sure it was real. But Mark was very nice, passionate
about ITC/EVP and very convincing. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect
when I originally heard what he did, with all the loonies out there
claiming all kinds of stuff, but I got a really good feeling from him
and he&#x27;s very, well, like I said, convincing. After that I went to his
web site and also bought one of his books, which was a nice read.
&gt;   
&gt; 
&gt;   I went to the Stanley Hotel in November with a ghost hunting group
and Mark was a speaker there. I was really looking forward to his
lecture, but ended up with a wicked stomach virus and had to come home
early. I missed just about everything that weekend!

&gt;   Oops! .  I forgot to answer: No, I have not given up ghost hunting
at all, but over the years I have come to focus more on the collection
and distribution of experiences than on encountering phenomena myself.
 ITC has really affirmed this for me.
&gt;   I&#x27;ve felt all along that my job is to make people aware that
spiritual phenomena go on all the time in millions of lives; I&#x27;m not a
scientist and I know nothing I do will change the way science thinks.
 BUT if I can open the minds of young people today, perhaps our future
scientists will make it their business to figure all this out. 
&gt;   I know this is a lot of what ITC experimenters are doing:
convincing others of the afterlife by their recorded evidence. 
Amazing things can happen when THAT happens. 
&gt;   Again, Mark Macy is so wonderful because he has dedicated his life
to this.  He and his colleagues have received such detailed
descriptions of how the afterlife works, that they have helped the
living change their lives to erase the fear of death--and to live in a
way that brings us to as high a spiritual level as possible right away
when our bodies die.  This means, for example, dealing with issues and
addictions, that plague us in life, since the spirits tell us we take
it all with us!  That is, death isn&#x27;t a cure-all.
&gt;   Any glimpse at the history of ITC shows us that all of this has
been gradually growing since the 19th century, when state-of-the-art
graphite pencils and telegraphs were used to contact the dead.  Since
then, there have been &quot;breakthroughs&quot; a number of times when
astounding floods of messages have come through.
&gt;   You experimenters are all so incredible--I&#x27;m amazed every day at
your love, dedication and faith.  Surely something wonderful is going
to come from all this, and I think it&#x27;s going to come during our
lifetimes.

&gt;   Yes, I did steal that phrase from Ursula because I thought it
described what I was doing as compared to what I would like to be doing!
&gt;    
&gt;   I like what you said about focus on the equipment helping to
establish the psychic connection.  It makes so much sense.  This
discussion has definitely shown me that mental tools and preparation
are as important as physical ones.  
&gt;    
&gt;   Thank you for your input.

&gt; Ursula your post is so much more eloquent and you&#x27;ve articulated the

&gt; &gt; Hi Robin,
&gt; &gt; Your phrase of &quot;ritualized vs. random&quot; is interesting. There are many
&gt; &gt; who believe that communication is between the conscious of the
&gt; &gt; researcher and the entity and the equipment is secondary. It&#x27;s easy to
&gt; &gt; get swept up in the technology and forget there is possibly a psychic
&gt; &gt; connection going on. With that said, focusing on equipment actually
&gt; &gt; can help the researcher become receptive to establishing a
&gt; &gt; communication link. While paying attention to the equipment, we forget
&gt; &gt; about the daily distractions and minor irritations that may prevent us
&gt; &gt; from establishing contact. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The setting up the gear we use could be considered the first part of
&gt; &gt; the &quot;ritual&quot;. I like to clear my mind, set up equipment, mess with it
&gt; &gt; some more, then I am mentally prepare to begin what I hope will be a
&gt; &gt; successful session.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I guess &quot;random&quot; recording to me would be what happens in the field
&gt; &gt; during a paranormal investigation. I don&#x27;t bring Box technology into a
&gt; &gt; location with the intention of possibly contacting lingering spirits
&gt; &gt; at that location but I do bring audio recorders in hopes of recording
&gt; &gt; evp&#x27;s.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I find the Box works perhaps even better when I&#x27;m in a familiar place
&gt; &gt; like the room in my home that is designated for that purpose. I do
&gt; &gt; desire to have the finest Box technology that is possible but more
&gt; &gt; important is the association that seems to occur between the
&gt; &gt; researcher and the Box that is favored. Despite some of the benefits
&gt; &gt; of the new gear, the one that I seem to have a connection with is one
&gt; &gt; that requires a little more finesse to operate. -Bill

&gt; &gt; &gt; Wow, thanks for your help guys!
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ursula, your post was lovely. I&#x27;ve been promising myself to learn 
&gt; &gt; &gt; more about Mark Macy&#x27;s work and will check out his website ASAP. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ritualized versus random recording makes sense to me now, as I want 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to accomplish true communication rather than continue being
verbally 
&gt; &gt; &gt; abused. Have you given up &quot;ghost hunting&quot; altogether? 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve been looking at the Olympus VN-4100 PC, Zack! I don&#x27;t know
if I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; need that much recording time, but I sure have liked the one I have 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and wouldn&#x27;t mind upgrading a bit. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Frank! I basically follow your suggestion when recording, and
once 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I learned to be quiet I actually started getting responses. I think 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the entities at my house got tired of playing with me though,
and now 
&gt; &gt; &gt; they aren&#x27;t saying anything. I kind of miss them, but I do feel
it&#x27;s 
&gt; &amp;g! t; &gt; time to move on.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Robin,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Radio Shack now carries the Olympus VN-4100PC at about the same 
&gt; &gt; &gt; price I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paid for my VN-960PC a couple years ago. I&#x27;ve been very happy
with 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 960. The 4100 has about 4 times the recording time, I think. That 
&gt; &gt; &gt; would 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make it about 24 hours.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m new to the group but probably know some of you from another
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; list. I haven&#x27;t been too active in the realm of EVP recording
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recently, but have had what I consider excellent results in the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; past
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using my little refurbished Ebay-bargain Olympus VN-120 PC.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m anxious to start recording again and am feeling pretty
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overwhelmed by the technology you all seem to be using. I know a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little about using good headphones and denoiser programs, but 
&gt; &gt; &gt; beyond
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I&#x27;m electronically challenged. Still, I wonder if there are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simple techniques I can experiment with to increase my
success. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think I&#x27;m a little bored.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve felt pretty strongly that I&#x27;ve been communicating with
a very
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small number of entities, and I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s due to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limitations of my equipment. My most impressive EVPs have
always 
&gt; &gt; &gt; been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; captured around my own home, particularly outside on the
hill and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near the barn. I&#x27;ve gotten two inside my house (after inviting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been negative 
&gt; &gt; &gt; messages.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#x27;m thinking about getting another DVR and would
love to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; hear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your thoughts and recommendations about which ones are best. I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like to communicate with more advanced entities eventually, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunately don&#x27;t have the brain for building anything myself.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!
