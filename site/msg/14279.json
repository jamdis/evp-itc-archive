And to call me &quot;another seriouse researcher&quot; is just plain argumentive, as it seems to look like that is his only way to express himself.....As for going to a &quot;moldy dark besement next&quot; I do recall that is where HE said he does his research :) Sheeesh......--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  So you&#39;re saying the boxes are BS, and one has to use the &quot;pure&quot; methods?\n&gt; Maybe you should try some moldy dark besement next.

I can say for a FACT--that the voices I\n&gt; &gt; receive are &quot;genuine&quot; and not audible before playback...that to me is more\n&gt; &gt; desirable (and credible) than some that take &quot;bits and pieces&quot; of a radio\n&gt; &gt; program to try and place the information into a &quot;question&quot; or &quot;answer&quot; then\n&gt; &gt; try and sell (my unique) way of reaching the unseen. And for the 2 weeks\n&gt; &gt; that I have been doing this...I seem to have gotten some amazing results\n&gt; &gt; with my &quot;recorder&quot; type technique. I am getting playful spirits, sadness,\n&gt; &gt; needy voices, anger, laughter, my first name spoken, possibly contacted my\n&gt; &gt; mother twice (unless is a trickster spirit)...so to say &quot;someone&quot; does this\n&gt; &gt; in a form (that others don&#39;t approve)?? None of us are experts yet...so we\n&gt; &gt; will look for ANYTHING to try and find the correct &quot;angle&quot; that works for us\n&gt; &gt; :) Even if it includes an old Cemetery or working off the &quot;Broadcast Band\n&gt; &gt; Radio Waves&quot; to shack up some type of sentence. I don&#39;t know...who has more\n&gt; &gt; &quot;throw away&quot; audio?? I know ALL of my EVP is &quot;unique&quot;.....I for one have\n&gt; &gt; tried the &quot;radio&quot; type of EVP. I tried 2 Shack Mods...no joy here people.\n&gt; &gt; For me &quot;I saw it at face value&quot; after just a few minutes. I don&#39;t mean to\n&gt; &gt; offend. But I didn&#39;t step &quot;first&quot;. Now who can say (for certain) WHO has the\n&gt; &gt; better form? What ever gets us closer to ourselves, and our lost FRIEND&#39;S.\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s ALL that matters man :) PS...I am a 46 year old male from Iowa. I\n&gt; &gt; have died and went to the tunnel (when I was 18)...was told &quot;not my time to\n&gt; &gt; go&quot; by a male voice that echoed (in the darkness). I have seen 3 UFO&#39;s in V\n&gt; &gt; formation (during Heavens Gate) *2nd comet of that year (here in Iowa) I\n&gt; &gt; have seen 1 &quot;shadow&quot; person (take 1 step and vanish) touched a ghost (snuck\n&gt; &gt; up on it)...got a burn on tip of my finger where I reached out to touch top\n&gt; &gt; of it&#39;s head (entity was small like child). I have developed 1 xray plate\n&gt; &gt; with my finger tips to make multiple white spots in the film-over 20 spots\n&gt; &gt; (naval medical officer was angry when he saw them) hahaha...he didn&#39;t know I\n&gt; &gt; did it when his back was turned :) Lot&#39;s of fun out here Guy&#39;s (and GALS)\n&gt; &gt; let&#39;s try and not point fingers now.....Knowbody should feel like they are\n&gt; &gt; singled out here...like I said &quot;none of us &quot;here&quot; have ALL the answers&quot;. So\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not a total &quot;Newbie&quot;...but I will try a grace yard again someday. And I\n&gt; &gt; would hope that people will respect me as well as I...of those IN that Grave\n&gt; &gt; Yard. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;April\n&gt; &gt; Abercrombie&quot; &lt;april@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe some ghost hunters assume this, but not us ghost hunters who take\n&gt; &gt; our field very seriously.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Frank Sumption\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 13, 2009 7:15 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Just wondering,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s just an assumtption on most &quot;ghost hunters&quot; part that the dead would\n&gt; &gt; be where they died, or were burried, a Hollywoodism I think.
