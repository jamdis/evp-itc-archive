<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>As I recall there was a long thin light on the ceiling, possibly a 
fluorescent, and a duplicate of the light down a bit from it and at 
an angle.

&gt; What do mean by &quot;displace&quot;? A long exposure will also cause weird  
&gt; effects with light.

&gt; &gt; About the Luminator....I have seen Luminator pictures where the
&gt; &gt; ceiling light was displaced and somewhat distorted. If whatever 
the
&gt; &gt; Luminator does can displace a ceiling light, surely it can also
&gt; &gt; displace a human face.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know as there are &quot;hundreds&quot; of examples available to
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public in the way of Luminator photographs,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I didn&#x27;t say that. I said there are hundreds of examples on line
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; known long exposures. When even a few of these are compared with
&gt; &gt; &gt; Luminator examples, I see a tremendous similarity. Do you?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but there are a couple of dozen in Macy&#x27;s book, &quot;Spirit 
Faces,&quot;
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yes, many many of them are open to wide interpretation,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Does that mean that you agree with my point? Because, as I 
reason
&gt; &gt; &gt; it, they are either spirit extras or they aren&#x27;t. They can&#x27;t 
sort-
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; be spirit extras. I&#x27;m not sure what other interpretations there
&gt; &gt; might
&gt; &gt; &gt; be in this instance.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just as our humble recordings are.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In addition to that majority that make us say, &quot;Come on!{&quot;
&gt; &gt; there
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are a handful that make you say &quot;Hmmmmmmm. . . .&quot; Just like we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offer a handful of results from our endless recording efforts 
to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try to convince the hard-nosed.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;d agree with you wholeheartedly, if I had ever seen one that
&gt; &gt; did,
&gt; &gt; &gt; in fact, make me go, &quot;Hmmmm.&quot; As I said, I have never seen one
&gt; &gt; where
&gt; &gt; &gt; the sitter and the extra did not share a consistent set of
&gt; &gt; features
&gt; &gt; &gt; and coloring. If you have any examples that do, and you can 
share
&gt; &gt; &gt; them, I&#x27;d be delighted to see them. I&#x27;d like my opinion to be
&gt; &gt; swayed.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Really, I would.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would think that many would see the Luminator efforts as a
&gt; &gt; modern
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effort at scrying.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you mean scrying as in the psychomanteum method developed by
&gt; &gt; &gt; Raymond Moody? My understanding, from attending a presentation 
by
&gt; &gt; Dr.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Moody, was that the psychomanteum produced full-blown 
apparitions
&gt; &gt; &gt; that could converse with the bereaved. Not sure these two types 
of
&gt; &gt; &gt; events are comparable.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Everything we do crosses boundaries, and my point is that it&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really hard to walk the line between trying to be scientific 
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to be open. It&#x27;s really, really hard! But if we give in
&gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; area, we have to be willing to give in another.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t think that is arguably true, Ursula. If the evidence
&gt; &gt; appears
&gt; &gt; &gt; good, I acknowledge it; if the evidence appears weak, I
&gt; &gt; acknowledge
&gt; &gt; &gt; it. It is simply not true to say that a person cannot be both 
open-
&gt; &gt; &gt; minded and scientific. I really do want to believe, but I won&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe just because I want to. And because you, me, or anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;gives&quot; in one area, does not make a phenomenon any more or less
&gt; &gt; real.
&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a classic example of the kind of photo that Mark

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a spirit extra. To me, clearly, this is the same woman--same 
hair,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same eyes, same mouth, same nose. Again, to me, it looks like 
a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; classic long exposure when compared with other known long

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve included just of hundreds of examples.
