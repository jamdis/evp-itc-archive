I&#39;m sorry, but I have to disagree. Well, ma=\r\nybe\nI&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; been imagining things for the past ten years, but there have b=\r\neen a\nhost\n&gt; &gt; of researchers inventing real-time communication devices tha=\r\nt\nproduce\n&gt; &gt; some pretty convincing intelligent responses, or &quot;EVP.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; No disrespect intended, but do you really think that this scientist\nis\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; an expert in EVP because he wrote a book that wasn&#39;t even picked up\nby a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; real publisher? That doesn&#39;t fly with people who have been doing\nthis\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; for ages and who have been producing exceptional results. A person\ncan&#39;=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; just saunter into a field such as this with a Ph.D. and flash a book\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; around claiming to know it all. In my humble opinion, this isn&#39;t a\nfiel=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; that can be targeted for scientific research. There are too many\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nvariables to consider, most of which we know nothing about. It&#39;s\nnearly\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n impossible to prove that EVP is real, scientifically or not, because\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhere are always skeptics who will claim it&#39;s all fake.
