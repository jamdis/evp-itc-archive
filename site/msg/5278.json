Very dark stuff.  Is it possible in scanning the bands, that \nthere&#39;s a band, frequency or transmitter, perhaps governmental, that \noverrides scanning?  \n\nSharon\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  This is weird, that mono tone voice coming through. This is what I \nget out of the segments I put up last night.  I wanted to see what \nothers heard, as while recording all I heard was the usual shortwave \nstations, and noise. A few English stations, some Spanish, and \nsomething that sounded maybe Korean. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  One of my co-workers thinks it he CIA messing with me, they just \nwant to see what tunrs up on the net.   Awhhh crap, there&#39;s only one \nway to go to be scientific, I&#39;ll have to make another and see if it \ngets the same stuff for someone else.   My apologies to those waiting \nfor previous projects and e-mail replies, I tend to get side tracked \nwith this stuff.
