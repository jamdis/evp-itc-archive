Asking the board open-ended questions, and interpreting the results, is sub=
jective. Asking for a specific, predetermined number is not subjective.=C2=
=A0 It is about as objective as you can get. 

I am not trying to prove any=
thing, or rule out any possibilities.=C2=A0 I am suggesting a method to det=
ermine, statistically, how accurate someone=E2=80=99s board, or methodology=
, might be.=C2=A0 Lets say I select two people, and in separate rooms, I gi=
ve each a spelling test.=C2=A0 Person 1 gets 100% right.=C2=A0 Person 2 get=
s 50% right.=C2=A0 Now, if I later give them a second spelling test, I can =
start with the theory that Person 1 will get near 100% correct, and Person =
2 will get near 50% correct.=C2=A0 This doesn=E2=80=99t mean they will, or =
that they have gotten these scores in the past.=C2=A0 But statistically, it=
 is a reasonable assumption at this point.=C2=A0 After the second test, I c=
an examine the deviation of the results from the first test, and update the=
 statistics.=C2=A0=C2=A0 If the deviation remains small (if the results rem=
ain similar), then I can more and more safely assume that person 1 will hav=
e a very high chance of getting a word right, and person 2 will have half t=
hat.=C2=A0 If the
 deviation swings wildly, than my statistics may not be v=
ery predictive after all.

The same is true with the board.=C2=A0 As you sa=
id, getting this number wrong doesn=E2=80=99t say past answers were wrong, =
or that future answers will be wrong.=C2=A0 And it is possible it could hav=
e been right by mere chance (though very unlikely: winning the lottery is m=
ore likely than guessing one number out of a billion).=C2=A0 What we=E2=80=
=99d have is one single objective data point.=C2=A0 It gives a starting poi=
nt for reasonable assumptions.=C2=A0 As you noted, after more such tests, t=
hose assumptions may start changing.=C2=A0 It would be interesting to see h=
ow they change, if they do.

Different people seem to have different feelin=
gs about the board.=C2=A0 Some believe it gives great results.=C2=A0 Some a=
re suspicious, even dubious.=C2=A0 And there are plenty of opinions in betw=
een.=C2=A0 My test is not for those who believe it is statistically likely =
that psychic tampering would occur, or that the board=E2=80=99s performance=
 is just not testable, which is the camp I gather you are in.=C2=A0 My test=
 is only good for that segment of this population who believes or wonders i=
f the board is capable of giving a straight objective answer to a straight =
objective questions, and that such performance is testable.=C2=A0 To addres=
s one of your examples, while it cannot show that an entity is reading my m=
ind if it gets the numbers right, it can conversely show that an actual ent=
ity is not reading my mind (or that it is not performing remote viewing, or=
 that it is not predicting the future of what the right answer is when it i=
s revealed, or that it is not being forthright in
 its answers) if it canno=
t get the numbers right in the first place.=C2=A0 But if these things are t=
rue, then it begs the question of its accuracy anyway.

So again, this is o=
ne data point, in what could be a number of tests, for those who are not ru=
ling out that testing is possible, and even desirable, when believing, or a=
cting on, information gathered by using this kind of board.=C2=A0

But again, this test could really only rule

=C2=A0
If i=

=C2=A0
If it got your number correct, that doesn't 
even help=
 immediately, because it could get the answer on mere 
chance.
=C2=A0
The o=

psychically influenced would be to =
run several tests of the same nature. Then, 
if it scored correct higher th=

=C2=A0
=C2=A0So we would be left with=C2=A0more
