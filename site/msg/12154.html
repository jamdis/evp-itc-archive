&gt; First off.............
&gt;
&gt; Wherever you are at with the Ovilus 1 you have to let the spirits  
&gt; there learn how to communicate thru the unit before you can  
&gt; effectively communicate with them.  You do this by telling the  
&gt; spirits that you have this device and that you want to communicate  
&gt; to them thru it.   And that they have to learn how to communicate  
&gt; thru it before you can begin.  So you let the unit run by itself for  
&gt; 30 to 60 minutes.  After all the random ramblings coming from the  
&gt; unit have slowed or calmed down then you will be able to communicate  
&gt; and start to receive answers that will make sense to you.  Its as  
&gt; simple as that.

&gt; Hi Jeff,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; What did you do? The below comments make no sense to me.  What do  
&gt; you have to do &quot;once&quot;?
&gt; Random garbage that made sense? lol!
&gt; What did you do for communication to flow smoothly. Would you  
&gt; elaborate?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!

&gt;&gt; Now if you use this device in the same location over and over again  
&gt;&gt; you only have to do it once.  When I first got mine it was spewing  
&gt;&gt; out all kind of random garbage that made sense.  But once I did  
&gt;&gt; this the communication flowed fluently.
