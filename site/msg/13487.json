I have been investigating since with my team since 1996 and I wish to use some sort of mobile ghost box type device in the field.  I have in my possesion an old radio scanner (yupeteru mv7100) which scans the following bands: \n# FM: 1 KHz, 5 KHz, 6.25 KHz, 9 KHz, 10 KHz, 12.5 KHz, 20 KHz, 25 KHz, 50 KHz and 100 KHz.\n# Wide FM: 50 KHz, 100 KHz\n# AM: 1 KHz, 5 KHz, 6.25 KHz, 9 KHz, 10 KHz, 12.5 KHz, 20 KHz, 25 KHz, 50 KHz and 100 KHz.\n# USB/LSB: 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 1 KHz, 5 KHz, 6.25 KHz, 9 KHz, 10 KHz, 12.5 KHz, 20 KHz, 25 KHz, 50 KHz and 100 KHz.\n\nFrequency        AM          FM        WFM        SSB\n 500 KHz        3.94        2.33        -         5.13\n   1 MHz        1.27         .76        -         1.45\n   2 MHz         .58         .35        -          .75\n   4 MHz         .40         .23        -          .38\n   6 MHz         .32         .17        -          .27\n  10 MHz         .26         .16        -          .23\n  20 MHz         .22         .13        -          .16\n  30 MHz         .22         .12       .36         .14\n  60 MHz         .22         .13       .39         .14\n 100 MHz         .21         .12       .38         .13\n 145 MHz         .25         .16       .48         .18\n 250 MHz         .29         .17       .73         .21\n 435 MHz         .35         .22       .67         .26\n 700 MHz         .46         .21       .77         .38\n 935 MHz         .37         .21       .55         .33\n1300 MHz          -          .47      1.73          -\n1500 MHz          -          .52      2.08          -\n1650 MHz          -         1.31      4.71          -\n\n\nMy question are, could this be used instead of the radio shack hacks?\n                 what frequencies would be desirable?\n                 what frequency increment step would be best?\n\n\nMany thanks for your time and trouble to read this post\n\nRegards\n\nScott Mackinnon\nPhoenix Paranormal Investigations\nwww.phxi.co.uk"}
