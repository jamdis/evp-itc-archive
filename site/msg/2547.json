My name is April Slaughter and I am so happy to \nbe \n&gt; a part of this group. Thank you for allowing me to join! \n&gt; \n&gt; Paranormal phenomena and I are no strangers to one another. It has \n&gt; always been an intrinsic part of my life as far back as I can \n&gt; remember, so what is considered to be out of the ordinary for most \n&gt; people is actually a pretty normal way of life for me. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m an investigator with quite a bit of experience behind me in the \n&gt; field. Years ago, I was under the assumption that EVP happened \naround \n&gt; everyone, and could be easily captured by any individual attempting \n&gt; to collect it. But I have come to find that many people find it to \nbe \n&gt; just as elusive as our crypto friend Bigfoot. For one reason or \n&gt; another, it has never been difficult for me to obtain it in most \nany \n&gt; situation or location. I will post examples of what I have \ncollected \n&gt; over the years if you are interested in hearing them.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have had the privilege of spending some time with 3 boxes, built \nby \n&gt; Frank... and I am always so intrigued by it. \n&gt; \n&gt; I look forward to getting to know you all!\n&gt; \n&gt; ~April\n&gt;\n\nApril,\n\nWelcome to the mad mad world of the evp-itc group !\n\nbruce"}
