Thanks Frank and Bruce for the tips.  Your thoughts help a lot.  I have also heard that an EVP "develops" with listening--that the quality actually improves the more you listen (well, until the tape starts to go bad LOL!)  What do you guys think of this?  
  I really, really like the idea of telling the entities to speak more clearly!  I have already found myself doing that--"come on, nice and loud for me"--I feel like a Kindergarten teacher!

I don't try pull voices out of the noise, cuz they change, or your mind hears it different, and whatever the message was is probably lost. This is why I like these methods that provide a "raw" audio, the voices tend to be much louder.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Translating?

      I'm getting voices, but for the life of me I can't translate them. 
I've been listening to the other members' files and reading the 
translations, but while I hear the voices I don't see how the 
translations are arrived at from the voices recorded. What's the 
secret to translating? Is is something that comes over time?
Thanks for any tips,
Ursula
