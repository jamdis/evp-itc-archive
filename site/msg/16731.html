 Well, your position is the best one to take.  I am an actual "card 
carryi=
ng Scientist" myself (no PhD yet)  I have KNOWN this stuff was real 
ever s=
ince I was a kid.  You can STILL be a real Scientist and accept the 
parano=
rmal though.  "the unknown" only upsets frightened, insecure people 
with n=
o desire to learn anything new. 

 Being a "Scientist" with no drive or des=
ire to learn something new and 
profound about the nature of the universe i=
s like being an "explorer" who 
never goes out  of his front door.  We have=
 a LOT of people who call 
themselves "Scientists" who are just like that--=
--  Mere "Tech's", 
actually who USE currently accepted science in their wo=
rk, but NEVER 
discover anything new beyond some extra decimal points or a =
subspecies of 
clam. 

  I, on the otherhand, am fascinated with the Parano=
rmal---after all, 
Paranormal is only those aspects of nature and reality t=
hat we do not 
understand yet.  History shows us that anything that mankind=
 did not know 
about, was once considered "Paranormal" or "supernatural".  =
Lightning, for 
example, was once thought of as supernatural "bolts from Ze=
us" or "the 
wrath of God".  Once Ben Franklin got a handle on it though, i=
t became 
de-mystified and became normal science of the day.  I feel that o=
ne day, 
what we call "Ghosts" Spirits" and parallel worlds, etc will one d=
ay 
become part of "conventional science" and lead to new technologies, jus=
t 
as electricity has.
This will open the way to faster than light space tr=
avel, teleportation, 
time travel, direct contact with aliens and the so ca=
lled "dead" 
etc.--Hell yes! its worth studying. 


Time and energy should =
not be wasted arguing to "Pseudo Skeptics" who have 
emotional issues with =
any thing they do not know about.
REAL Science involves a methodical approa=
ch to problems and mysteries, 
Science keeps us from becoming the excited, =
emotional  "Flakes" who will 
believe ANYTHING on an emotional basis (the e=
xact opposite of Pseudo 
Skeptics)  Neither Flakes nor Pseudo Skeptics use =
Real Science  They base 
their assertions on emotions rather than experienc=
e and experimentation. 
Ya gotta be "Skeptical" but not take it too far.  D=
on't dismiss the fact 
that "something is there", simply because you don't =
like the folk tale 
explanation of it.---Find out what's really going on.  =
That's the key to 
"balanced research".  What is generally considered "The =
truth" changes 
over time with new knowledge.  The "skeptic" can't accept t=
hat.

 Well, the comment on education is aimed specifically at the skeptics. 
Gen=

Schwartz=
 who acutally and honestly tests mediums. The-professed--skeptics
