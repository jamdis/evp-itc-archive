Only 2 days left on the auction.  No bidding, just one low price.  There are 3 left on there.\n\nYou will see that they are reasonably priced for an adjustable sweep ghost box.  This circuit is a linear/random hybrid sweep that i came up with.\n\nThe box sweeps in a linear fashion, but changes speeds randomly as it does it.  The sweep knob is to set a base sweep, than the circuit takes over after that.\n\n\n-Steve H."}
