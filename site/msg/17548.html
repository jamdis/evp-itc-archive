<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Are you asking what is the P-SB7? It is called a Spirit Box. It is Chris Flemings and Gary Galka&#x27;s device they make. Same premise as Frank&#x27;s Boxes.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; These are from my first session with my new P SB-7.
&gt; 
&gt; I  conducted this experiment with my 6 year old daughter. Unfortunatley you 
&gt; will  hear her say what she thinks she hears in the files. Please try not 
&gt; to be  influenced by her. I will admit though that she seems to hear these 
&gt; things  much better then I can.
&gt; 
&gt; Though I am still not convinced, some of these  are uncanny, and I was 
&gt; surprised. I will be conducting ongoing, regular  experiments with this.
&gt; 
&gt; Opinions are  welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; April
