<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>&quot;Truth Echo&quot;, that&#x27;s interesting, cuz I thought if it had the echos it was 
more likely a true spirit voice. I can hear all those, except the first one.

&gt;
&gt;Yeah I get it with most methods too. I questioned them on that and I was 
&gt;given a couple different responses. Think of it as a group effort, many 
&gt;minds coming together to convey the same thought/words. Sometimes you get 
&gt;the opposite effect where they speak over each other with entirely 
&gt;different words. They also said something about alternate realities echo. 
&gt;But thats too big for my tired brain to think about tonight so I will just 
&gt;attach a few echo topic files here and maybe some of you can hear what I 
&gt;hear and see what they have to say. =)
&gt;
&gt;   Misty
&gt;   PS If you dont see files attached then you dont have individual mail 
&gt;settings turned on for group.

&gt;
&gt;I have gotten that echo wiht almost ever method, EVPmaker, and radio
&gt;scanning methods, or my boxes, there&#x27;s often a pre-echo, and post echo. I
&gt;don&#x27;t know what causes it.

&gt; &gt;Hi Everyone,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;My name is James from Arizona and have about a million questions about
&gt; &gt;EVP. I am a ghosthunter and I have had great success in recording
&gt; &gt;EVP&#x27;s recently. I have included a link to one of our recent
&gt; &gt;investigations and recorded an EVP at a restaurant that said &quot;Say
&gt; &gt;Goodbye!&quot; as an investigator and myself were walking away from the
&gt; &gt;area.This is an authentic EVP.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It came from a cassette tape and has not been altered or filtered in
&gt; &gt;the least. I have been an active ghosthunter for about 3 years now.
&gt; &gt;Here is the link. Would like to know what you all think of it.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Question: I am noticing a strange echo reverberation when I record
&gt; &gt;loud EVP&#x27;s. When I record &quot;whisper&quot; type EVP&#x27;s I don&#x27;t get this echo.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;What do you all think casuses this strange echo quality?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Look forward to talking to all of you!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;James
