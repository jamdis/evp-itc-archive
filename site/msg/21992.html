&gt; I got to redo this vid, it&#x27;s terrible, no expert here, just go listen to  
&gt; it, there are a few things toward the end you can understand, a few words, I  
&gt; really had trouble understand what he was saying when i posted it, the 
&gt; words  change some times. sf
&gt;  
&gt; Troy, was found &quot;innocent in Heaven&quot; and Troy is in the light, I did some  
&gt; spirit files, here is what I got, he wants his family to know, &quot;I&#x27;m 
&gt; innocent, I  love them, and I got in the light, I have an angel, he looks like me 
&gt; and he is  black, tell them I love them, and call my bar and let him know&quot;  I 
&gt; think he  is talking about his lawyer, when I get better files, I will post 
&gt; them.
