I\n&gt; live in S. GA. I&#39;m a\n&gt; wife, mother of one, artist (photographer, and professional\n&gt; soap-artisan). I&#39;ve had a life long interest in the\n&gt; supernatural/paranormal/occult. I&#39;ve looked into\n&gt; joining a few local\n&gt; paranormal groups which have sprung up this year, but thus\n&gt; far haven&#39;t\n&gt; entered membership level with either. Soooo, instead of\n&gt; just being\n&gt; stagnant and doing nothing, I&#39;m interested in putting\n&gt; together more\n&gt; equipment/&quot;know-how&quot; from a techie standpoint of\n&gt; view for doing my own\n&gt; investigations with family and close friends. (Pretty much\n&gt; all members\n&gt; of my family are interested in this sort of phenomenon.) I\n&gt; have a very\n&gt; techno-knowledgeable husband who could pretty much put\n&gt; together\n&gt; whatever equipment we need. Of course, being that we&#39;re\n&gt; pretty much a\n&gt; one income family, the more we can build ourselves,\n&gt; lowering the cost,\n&gt; the better. ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; I have lots of side interests, background, etc. but that\n&gt; sorta covers\n&gt; where I&#39;m coming from.\n&gt; \n&gt; And yes, I&#39;m finding all this information (out\n&gt; &quot;there&quot;) so over\n&gt; whelming!  Trying to figure out the right place to start. I\n&gt; do plan on\n&gt; having my techie-hubby check out Frank&#39;s schematics,\n&gt; because I do hear\n&gt; over and over that his box is still\n&gt; &quot;da&#39;bomb.&quot;  :D\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; Becca"}
