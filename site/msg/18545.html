I make the triangle sweep adjustable so I c=

sometimes have to add a pot to adjust the max l=

to 1710 Khz and FM 88.5 to 108mhz, bu=
t you don't have to cover the  entire

 to provide the raw audio bits the  
entities use to make their voices.

 A Danish researcher back in the 80s was just "wobbling" between a  couple =

stations to make contact. His name was Stein and there's more info on  the=
 
German VTF site. Stein also has his sweep circuit there. 
 
 The best sou=
nding systems seem to be the way Steve Hultay makes  his, by 
adding sweep =
to a complete radio. see _keyportparanormal.com_ 
(http://keyportparanormal=
.com/) . I take the  tuners out of the radio, and supply my own 
amplifier =
and sweep. At present I'm  making a box using a Timex clock radio 
tuner, t=
he triangle sweep, and computer  sound amplifier and speaker system 
for th=
e bass response. I just started  this project yesterday. I use Timex 
model=
 T309T AM/FM/nature sounds clock  radios when I can find them in thrift 
st=
ores cheap. I found a Timex model  T313T this morning, and hoping it has th=
e 
seperate tuner board inside, as the  300 series has so far. 
 
 I used t=
o use car stereo tuner modules, but those tend to be too  noisy. 
Box 13, t=
hat Hultay just got back is based on a car tuner. He did a  YouTube 
video =
of it.
 
 I'm still pretty much an amateur at this, there are so many  vari=
ables.
