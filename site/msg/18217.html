&gt; Wow, that more lines up with what has been said all along by preachers. I

&gt; &gt; Well, it&#x27;s sure not her, it&#x27;s some fella now in Rome, according to David

&gt; Obama makes a big mess for the US, gets more kids killed in senseless wars,
&gt; I know, he didn&#x27;t start things, but he isn&#x27;t getting those kids out either,
&gt; he is sending more to those country&#x27;s over there, such a waste.Â  And will
&gt; even start up a 3 month mandatory civilian army for young people ages 18 to
&gt; 19 maybe, younger.Â  Jerusalem will be left neutral, as will be the country
&gt; of Israel, because the antichrist wants to seat himself there in the near
&gt; future.Â  The antichrist is some guy that was born without a spirit, he has
&gt; a soul, but wasn&#x27;t given a spirit until recently, that was the spirit of the
&gt; antichrist that took over his physical body, so in a sense it is a spirit
&gt; possession.Â  I really hope this is all wrong, I want to have things be like
&gt; Pollyanna, but it won&#x27;t be that way for some time yet. sf

&gt; &gt; Â  I saw a clip on youtube where a ghost box group was asking who the
&gt; antichrist was. Of course their first question was if it was Obama. the
&gt; answer was no. So then they asked who it was, and the box said it was Sarah
&gt; Palin! Lol, now I know... the spirits are all people from the left!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Beth
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; PS- I love Sarah! At this point, I would vote for her in a second!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, ya know Beth, he has broke many promises, as they all do once
&gt; they get into office, look at how he has &quot;brought them all home&quot;Ã‚Â  lol, he
&gt; is sending more and more into other country&#x27;s, maybe, he is like a puppet
&gt; for higher ups, it&#x27;s a scary situation, David has mention the antichrist on
&gt; more then one occasion, he has moved from Spain to Rome lately, and will
&gt; start up soon, making people really like him at first, then after someone
&gt; here, could be a president, not going to say who, starts a war between
&gt; several big country&#x27;s.Ã‚Â  The US will be so weak from all the wasted life
&gt; of those young people going into middle east and places, (they should be
&gt; getting married, buying homes, and making baby&#x27;s right now, not dying).Ã‚Â
&gt; It&#x27;s a situation
&gt; &gt; &gt; similar to Viet Nam, we lost a whole generation just right there,
&gt; and what did we win?Ã‚Â
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Only about oil control, thing is the US may not follow the
&gt; antichrist cause, but we are going to be so darn weak, that we will be
&gt; fighting each other just to survive from what he says, he mentioned several
&gt; country&#x27;s that will not follow antichrist, which are: US, Australia, Canada,
&gt; UK, Russia, or China, thing is we may be enticed into fighting these other
&gt; country&#x27;s which will only serve to weaken US more.Ã‚Â  The antichrist won&#x27;t
&gt; get Canada because they will bring him trouble, for some reason, maybe, when
&gt; he thinks he&#x27;ll get those stubborn limies.Ã‚Â  Believe me, I hope nothing
&gt; like this happens, but we are moving toward much of it right now, and it&#x27;s
&gt; scary. sf

&gt; &gt; &gt; Ã‚Â  Well, I for one, hope David is right about Obama leaving
&gt; office. Of course, that would mean Joe Biden would be president... sigh.
&gt; That isn&#x27;t a happy thought either.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope there is not another war. I just heard somewhere of secret
&gt; plans to attack Iran. Lol, if I heard about it, it must not be very secret.
