People have recorded evp using a variety of methods and tools and conditions. I&#39;ve even had an instance that chainsaw noise was being used and I was able to record some of the speech.\nMusical instruments such as guitar and piano tones have also yeilded some results. Ive posted some in the files section here of a few methods and alot on esnips.

I never\n&gt; tested this with a recorder, but I&#39;ve caught some evps\n&gt; with refrigerator motors and other devices. Audacity has\n&gt; the &quot;add white noise&quot; option, which allows you to\n&gt; record directly to your computer and allow the entities to\n&gt; organize the generic white noise. I&#39;m eager to try\n&gt; that. An excellent observation you had, Misty. I think they\n&gt; must grab hold of any babbling or whirring noise available\n&gt; to communicate, whether we&#39;re able to pick it up or\n&gt; not. That&#39;s why I carry around one of the lightweight\n&gt; Olympus recorders -- no telling where you&#39;re going to\n&gt; find a babbling-brook or steady motor sound.

Best advice one cold give is try\n&gt; it \n&gt; \n&gt; yourself for a while and see what you come up with =)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, &quot;threadsintyme@\n&gt; ...&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;Threadsintyme@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why do you need to &quot;sweep&quot; the AM spectrum? \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Has anyone tried this but without sweeps on the\n&gt; shortwave band? Has \n&gt; \n&gt; any research been done? Could it be that the AM band has\n&gt; some sort \n&gt; \n&gt; of &quot;special properties&quot; that would allow such\n&gt; communication? \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why is it that the AM band has to be used with a radio\n&gt; station \n&gt; \n&gt; playing? There are parts of the spectrum that is just\n&gt; outside of that \n&gt; \n&gt; spectrum that might provide a better form of communication.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Al\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ____________ _________ _________ _________ _________\n&gt; _________ _\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Click here for great computer networking solutions!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; http://thirdpartyof fers.juno. com/TGL2131/\n&gt; fc/Ioyw6iighEHwM AbLKMUuYo359E\n&gt; \n&gt; 28alDzNnXaMa5yrqURX jmUoY4EK4/\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;     \n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Netscape.
