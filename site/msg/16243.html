<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just wanted you to know that I didn&#x27;t comment because I can&#x27;t hear 99% of the files you post -- for some reason (probably my stupid computer), they just won&#x27;t play for me.  Which is a shame, because I really wanted to hear them!

&gt;  It&#x27;s just like these, not one comment on them. I still hear them as I did a couple weeks ago. Not &quot;standard&quot; (whatever that is) EVP, but why should it be ignored, unless of course I&#x27;m imagining what I heard. 
&gt; 
&gt;  I think the reason for this kind of stuff is multi level. First, it shows EVP/box voices are not the usual HW BS. Second, there&#x27;s infinite levels that come through, some if it deceptive(yet teaches). Most important, I think it pokes fun at what we think we know is out there. 
&gt; 
&gt;  I sent these to one of the author/experts and as usual--no response--they seemingly know so much better. It just does not fit the haunting/ghost hunter paradigm--where the megabucks and fame is. 
&gt; 
&gt;  And yeah, I&#x27;ve spent the last week moving, I&#x27;m physically tired, and mentally have the usual case of torqued jaws.

&gt; &gt;  I know, not proper EVP, but ....Now I have cartoon spirits---LOL!  I think
&gt; &gt; the &quot;woman&quot; mentioned is maybe LK, something aobut Radio Shack in the middle
&gt; &gt; of that.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  These are not presented for feedback, just what I got last night.
