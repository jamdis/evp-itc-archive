Mr Sumption I do not know you and we have never meet so Im not sure what is=
 going on here. The original post that started this between me and you was =
a copy from a post I made on my facebook page=C2=A0first, then=C2=A0other p=
laces including EVP-ITC and the other group RTSC. It has nothing to do with=
 you, it was a statment about my work to anyone that might be interested in=
 what I am doing and how I make my devices. I will not attack you personall=
y however your (place polictically correct descriptive word here) comments =
are starting to worry me.
