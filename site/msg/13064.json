The\n&gt; &gt; problem, is that there could be a predisposition to hear what someone\n&gt; &gt; has already described: it is only a possibility, not a certainty.\n&gt; &gt; But, since it is possible to minimize this issue with a change in the\n&gt; &gt; test, I recommended that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Maybe I would better understand your issue if you told me where my\n&gt; &gt; suggestions would not add value and objectivity to the test.

Now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that everyone knows they are from a plane crash, that will set\n&gt; &gt; up the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prejudice of hearing plane/travel related words in the evp\nnoises.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And as you probably know, once that prejudice is active, once\n&gt; &gt; I say\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Doesn&#39;t that sound like someone saying\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Sssssstewardesssss...&quot;, then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone hears THAT word, rather than just noise, or, for\nexample\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Stewed ass&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And, if something does sound like a plane/travel related\nword, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will now be highlighted as an example of why this was a\nsuccessful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test, and the other less-relevant words ignored. This is a\nform of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confirmation bias, which again, hurts the value of the test.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A more objective way would have been to send out both crash\n&gt; &gt; related\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; items, and completely innocuous items, with no explanation of\n&gt; &gt; where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each was from, and see what kind of EVPs were returned on\neach.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Further, the returned EVPs should then be returned to\nsomeone to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evaluate who ALSO doesn&#39;t know the origin of the objects,\nso that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they do not torture the interpretations into the forms you\n&gt; &gt; hope and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expect them to be (again, plane/travel related). While this\n&gt; &gt; test of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course lacks all kinds of controls, this would at least be a\n&gt; &gt; start to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defining a double-blind test, which is the gold standard\nfor good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; research in this kind of research.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even though you have tried to keep some of the information\nquiet,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is still quite a large opportunity for guessing and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coincidence. For example, one person might assume this was\nfrom an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; airshow (since, as you said, the event was very fast, and many\n&gt; &gt; people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saw it), and so only send in EVPs that would be relevant\nto that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation (I.e. Not sending in child-like sounds, or\nsending in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sounds that sound like scratchy tower or inter-plane\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication). If the crash was a commercial airline,\nthen dozens\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of different people could have been killed, which means\nyou could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find SOME relevancy no matter what noises are returned to you:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practical any word, name, or sound will support some\n&gt; &gt; speculation that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it could have been relevant to one of those people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do think it is a good idea to test your theories. But my\npurpose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here is to suggest ways to help these tests be as objective as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible, and for your efforts and testing to be as worth\nwhile as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible, and for the youtube video results you make to be as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; valuable and bulletproof as possible. But I am concerned\nthat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; above scenario is full of opportunity for subjectivity and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misinterpretation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
