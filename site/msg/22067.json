My friend actually recorded it.\n\nShe has been experiencing cabinets opening and closing at night and some other noises (footsteps). One night recently she left the recorder on and you can hear her snoring (wow, she snores LOUD!).  We heard what sounded like a deep wailing voice saying &quot;I want you!  I want you!&quot; then &quot;I want my mommy!&quot;.  At the very beginning it said &quot;Are you my mommie?&quot;.  It was rather scary and the voice sounded like it was crying.\n\nIn rewinding it to get it to play over and over again we accidently hit the speed button (faster) and suddenly we heard a child!! saying/crying those words!\n\nIt was heartbreaking!  There are no children in that apartment nor any on either side (these are block apartment, only four single level ones.\n\nI have never heard such a clear EVP.  This is on a micro tape and have no idea how to transfer it to a computer file but would love for someone here to hear it.\n\nHas anyone here ever had an experience like this?  Wish there was something we could do to ease this spirits agony.  The child sounds like maybe 2 or 3 years old at the most. Could this be an &quot;imprint&quot; type of energy?  The only thing makes me doubt this are the words &quot;Are you my mommie?&quot;."}
