<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well would you guys think I&#x27;m nuts if I told you I have a short EVP from Michael Jackson? I was at a park here in Des Moines, Iowa on June 28th. The name of the location is Prospect Park. In the original file I ask if MJ can hear me.....and I get a &quot;yes I can&quot;. Well then I run this through a denoise program and I hear &quot;yes I can&quot; then a second later I hear a young boy with a mockish tone say &quot;your talking in the last mike&quot; (also think I hear a young girl later but can&#x27;t make it out)*I MIGHT understand the girl, but won&#x27;t make a statement at this time. The boy is easier to hear in the denoised program (better than Michael). BUT both voices are hard to hear. Maybe you can amplify for yourself.....that way I won&#x27;t SPLATTER the audio to much and you might be able to adjust for yourself. If someone wants the unedited WAV file that&#x27;s 1.16MB I can send to email address. That way you might be able to -denoise- or enhance MUCH better than I am able to. I can just make out what is said........but I assure you&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it is in there!!! I am sending the MP3 to my files folder, it is the denoised version. I&#x27;m not to familiar with the denoise program so I think I used the default settings. Jim H</pre>
