Come on! Everyone is worth something to someone. She was like so many other=
s who put a lot of stock into this type of communication. As fantastic and =
incredible as it is, it is not perpect. Far from it. There are so many laye=
rs of entities out thier that you can connect to depending on your attitude=
 and disposition. Honestly, I agree with her that she is not cut out for th=
is. Otherwise she may have gotten herself into a bad place with the wrong o=
nes. Not evil...just wrong!

Sorry Frank,
It's just the way you worded your statement. made i=

t more into what you wrote. Sorry! 
I suspect that she may not have a lot g=

gan. We have the worst economy in the US. There are also other reasons, I a=
m sure. But we may have all that she had going, you know. 
Would like to ad=
