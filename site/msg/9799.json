Can&#39;t wait to see how my session comes out when I \nclean \n&gt; &gt; them up a bit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I recorded two sessions the second one the reception was so bad \nI \n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t get much I could hear. I seem to have an Australian \nspirit \n&gt; &gt; named &quot;Steve&quot; on my first recorded session he said his name in \na  \n&gt; &gt; Australian accent and on the second session he said &quot;gidday&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kay\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ooops... forgot to give you the info, Kay:  Part # 274-373\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; productId=2062470&cp=&sr=1&origkw=1%2F8+to+3%2F32&kw=1%\n2F8+to+3%\n&gt; &gt; 2F32&pa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rentPage=search\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; \n&lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Kay.  You&#39;ll get the same patch cable AND an adapter (1/8 \n&gt; &gt; female to 3/32 male, I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; think, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; double check).  That&#39;s what I have to use on my Panasonic \nDR60, \n&gt; &gt; since the ear jack on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; smaller.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Margaret\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am heading to Radio shack after I get off work.

The mic hole in the \nrecorder \n&gt; &gt; is way \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; smaller then the one that goes into the pc.
