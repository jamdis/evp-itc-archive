&gt; I have one theory-westen science is is a religious, one where  the member
&gt; are not allowed to question, or think. all facts are ignored, evidecne had
&gt; to be to picked and choosen for acceptability, anyone disagreeing wiht
&gt; science mnust be ridicauled into submission.
&gt;
&gt;  Anything to this!!?? WTF do you need? Once again, ignore all evidence, and
&gt; anyone that gets any evidence must be ignored and ridiculed.
&gt;
&gt;  Heres&#x27; a fact you can ignore, I&#x27;m the guy with the &quot;remove member&quot; button,
&gt; and I think it&#x27;s time to start using it.

&gt;&gt; Come one frank, few of the people here are going after you or are out to
&gt;&gt; get you.  There are fundamental problems, or maybe a better way to say that
&gt;&gt; is, concerns about the nature and logic of your theory.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What many of us are saying is simply, lets look at the whole of the
&gt;&gt; argument and see what the truth is.  Let&#x27;s see if there is anything to this,
&gt;&gt; and if so, lets try and understand cause and effect.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have never said you were crazy, at least publicly LOL Nor do I think you
&gt;&gt; are a bad guy or anything like that.  I just think there are some strong
&gt;&gt; fundamental problems with this idea from the start.  Once I can get past
&gt;&gt; that, then no problem.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It is a big and beautiful world Frank, lets enjoy it while we can

&gt;&gt;&gt; The world is not out to get you Frank.  Stop with the crap and grow a

&gt;&gt;&gt; make this into a religion then so be it, but don&#x27;t kick the rest of us that
&gt;&gt;&gt; want to look at things objectively.  You are only making yourself look like

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  I&#x27;m just sayin&#x27;--there are a very few that act like all is known and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can all be expelaned away. It&#x27;s those few that make comments back and forth,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; between themselves implying that all this is foolishness, and they know so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much better. I don&#x27;t know why why, but that stuff really chaps my hide!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  I know for a fact that some of the voices out of the box, and other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; methods are imagination, as they tend to change from day to as perceptions
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shift. I have stuff form ten years ago that sound the same, and I aslo have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tapes from the first boxes that talk about what&#x27;s going on now. I have some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; voice segments for m years ago that are also gibberish and noise.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  I don&#x27;t need some duffus telling me how I fool myself.
