<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Alright, you all know I&#x27;m vocal and I haven&#x27;t made any &quot;friends&quot; here
but, if we can put that aside for a moment...

Spirit communication has been my passion since day one, a little over
6 years ago. I am a believer in the afterlife and a believer in
spirits attempting to communicate with us for a variety of reasons. I
have spiritual beliefs that I feel strongly about and devote much of
my waking (and sleeping) moments to thoughts about this field.
However, I am also a researcher and a skeptic. In order for me to
allow ideas to become part of my reality I must experiment. In order
for me to believe something is paranormal I HAVE to rule out all other
possible causes. That being said, I have some questions. My hope is
that there are some here willing to enter into discussion with me.

I have a difficult time with many of the files here. Many times, there
is no question included in the file. I can not determine whether or
not the &quot;reply&quot; is an intelligent reply. Maybe this has to do with
allowable file size.

Some of the files I have been able to download. (I don&#x27;t always keep
my email settings on for this group as I get too many - lol) When I
look at the file I see problems. There will be complete flat line
silence between the words. Many times the &quot;reply&quot; is also at the same
decibel as the question askers voice. Those two things should not
occur naturally considering the devices being used. That tells me that
there is manipulation of the files. Now, what is manipulation to me,
may not be manipulation to others. To me, any altering of the recorded
file constitutes manipulation. I do not know if the reply was
intelligent or manipulated to be intelligent. 

Some say that they simply remove the &quot;no response&quot; time. I&#x27;ve been
told it can be as much as 18 seconds removed from between words. Now
we run into the problem of us deciding what word fits in with the
question. What words are being ignored?  Did we take nonsense and make
sense? Did we amp every noise/word or only what fit?

I think it&#x27;s great that files are offered for peer review. However, I
think we have to load them untouched or at the very least, offer
exactly what was done to the entire file. Time elapsed between words,
what was amped, etc. I&#x27;d also love to see some of these sessions video
taped with the question asker facing the camera and a second hand
clock visible. Truly, we aren&#x27;t researching if we don&#x27;t have some
protocol in place.

Here is an issue I have with the RS Hacks. I have the 469. It takes
approximately 18 seconds to scan through the AM frequencies. Now, the
typical person would think that we can take that 18 seconds and divide
it by the number of AM stations to determine how long we are on each
station before moving on to the next one. In that way we could
determine what is impossible to be said via a radio fragment. However,
that&#x27;s not correct. The scan cycle can vary from one frequency to the
next and of course the biggest problem is that some stations are
picked up over multiple frequencies; AM 640 can be heard on 630, 640,
650, 660 and maybe even 670. That extends the time a great deal. This
is a difficult problem because it is almost impossible for the average
person to be able to make a determination on time this way. 

I heard about the following today; An experimenter records at the same
time every day Mon-Fri. We hear about the importance of meditating,
automatic writing, etc at the same time every day but what we have to
remember with this, is that now we are in essence tuning into the same
radio show every day. One of my first experiments with the 469 had me
hearing this deep male voice over and over again. What was he trying
to tell me, I wondered. Than I realized that he was speaking
approximately every 18 seconds; every time the scan hit that station.
So, if you are removing up to 18 seconds between words, then you are
really only recording the words from one station. 

This post is IN NO WAY trying to start anything besides discussion
about some research problems. I know that there are those who are not
concerned with anything more than the communication itself but I think
that it is of the utmost importance to attempt to factor in some
protocol in order for this to be considered serious research at all.</pre>
