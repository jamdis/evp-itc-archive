So they get used to a certain person that has been using \nthat individual box and when the user changes they get somewhat \nconfused about who is using the box. But I think they are getting used \nto me being the new user. my sessions are becoming more and more \nresponsive. I have posted some file from session #2 with the box, they \nare in the files section please let me know what you think.\n\nBruce"}
