This one is one of them! Very nice, very interesting=\r\n, definatley something happening! I am fixin to get my own and start as wel=\r\nl. I got to witness the box belonging to Bill Murphy at a Paranormal Meetup=\r\n group. This was the first time I had seen such a thing and to be honest at=\r\n first was a bit skeptical, even though I strongly believe and feel have co=\r\nllected much credible evidence of paranormal activity for many years now. I=\r\n have come to conclude that I am extremely sensitive to energies as well as=\r\n extremely intuitive. The box has a definate energy about it. I continue to=\r\n read everything thats posted and listen in hope to grasp this whole concep=\r\nt. I cant get it out of my mind. How amazing this form of EVP is. Good job =\r\nto all, hopefully I will be able to contribute some time soon. You know yea=\r\nrs ago my kids had Furbies (sp?), and they would just start talking out of =\r\nno\n where and say very revelent things that I felt was strange at the time =\r\nand out of context to anything my kids said....LOL, I wonder if there is an=\r\ny connection. Maybe not but I never forget them, Frank&#39;s Box conjures up th=\r\ne same energy to me. \nTinamarie Sexton (gypsyharlot1111)\nTinamarie\n\n----- O=\r\nriginal Message ----\nFrom: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@y=\r\nahoogroups.com\nSent: Saturday, July 21, 2007 6:48:42 PM\nSubject: Re: [EVP-I=\r\nTC] Re: New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n\nThanks for the feedback Steve its int=\r\neresting to know what you guys hear.
