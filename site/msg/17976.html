All you  have to do is ask your boxes/spirits/ aliens/etc, what it  is.

I have taken a picture of it, and posted it to  the files section here, so =

there is no way I can squirm  out of the results:

Please do not try t=

download it to yo=

it  during, or =
after, the test.

Answers anyone reveals  after noon Wednesday don't count.=
 Partial answers
