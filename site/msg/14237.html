If using esnips it has buddy list availability to add other members and you=
 can post your link here when you update and upload new files.=A0 The same =
goes for storing it on any other file share site. Just post a link and let =
us know when you upload new files. 
=A0
I don't mean to seem anal but I jus=
t went thru and cleaned out all the wav files and that alone took up more t=
han 40% of our groups total space. For instance one member has posted about=
 10 files in mp3 format which didnt even equal 1/4 of the space taken up by=
 another members=A0single wav format file. When it comes down to being 98% =
full you realize some changes have to be made and this is just one of the m=
any changes this group has had to make to allow more members to join us and=
 have fair access.
=A0
For those who are posting many files I suggest you d=
o the same because eventually it will come down to one of the mods asking y=
ou to do so in order to clear some room. I like the idea of post now then r=
emove after a time period but the truth is that some peoples files need to =
remain=A0without restraint=A0such as Stefans who has been more than generou=
s to post some files which may come in very handy for some of you to experi=
ment with using his EVPmaker software. These files are for the group as a w=
hole to make use of and they will not be deleted. 
=A0
That being said, ask=
 for help when you need it and feel free to share with people using the bes=
t possible approach for the group as a whole rather than as an individual. =
When there were only 5 of us here it wasnt a big deal, but once you get pas=
t 500 it starts to take a toll and sacrifices must be made. Ive deleted alo=

ound a very long time to help clear some space and they did so willingly fo=
r the betterment of the group. They had some really great files too.=A0Most=

OL Snowfire! Nope it was not you this time. Others should read before they =
post because we just addressed this subject. Esnips is very easy to use it =
has two uploading options in case you cant use the java application use the=
 single file uploader. Works a lot like email upload attachments.

If you n=

 to help you figure it out. Posting from email as an attachment also works =
just not so well for the very large file sizes. There are many other file s=

 ability to share with friends including sharing storage space.
