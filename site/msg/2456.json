His name was \nDaniel he was thirteen.  The parents of all the children in the middle \nschool were notified that three other teenagers were involved in a \nSuicide pact.  \n\nWhen I gave the box session I asked if any spirits could help with \nLocating the other three children.  The message I receive pertaining to \nDaniel, was directly after asking about him and the other teenagers.  \n\nThe message was giving in forward and in reverse.  The message was \nIn it vague but did mention Daniels name and that I could help.  \n\nThe next box session will be dedicated solely to information about \nDaniel and the other students involved with him.  I will post any \nRelevant messages.  \n\nBruce"}
