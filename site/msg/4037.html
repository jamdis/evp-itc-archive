<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Misty,

Hey... thanks for the kind words about the videos!  I just wanted to 
help get the information out there so people can had an affordable 
method of experimenting with some different ghost box functionality 
devices.

No, Bruce, Steve, and I are not working together per-say unless you 
call everyone trying to see what we can all come up with in this 
field, is working together. I guess we are all working together using 
that definition, huh?  I just write to them on occassion.

I see you may already have been given access to the REG podcast, 
based on another post.  Let me know if that&#x27;s not the case.

Orlando!  That is where I fly into, then I drive to Cocoa Beach.
Didn&#x27;t get to see the shutle take-off though... cause they postponed 
it and I had to get back.  Then I get to Denver, they cancel all 
flights to Colorado Springs because of weather, so we take a taxi 
back to the Springs, but my luggage is still in Denver.  I hope I get 
to see it someday... I had some new clothes in there!!!

Sorry your 12-470 radio ended up that way.  Those wires are easy 
targets of getting snipped while closing the case.  They should use 
conectors for all that, but I guess that would be too expensive since 
they mass produce them.

Have a great day!
- Mike

&gt; yep workin together gets alot more accomplished =)
&gt;    
&gt;   Hey Mike did you happen to get the podcast of rosemary I tried to 
catch it but forgot til it was too late so when i turned it on it was 
on the next guys. Then tonight they replay it so I was going to play 
it at work but can ya believe the dang radio there does not dial down 
low enough to hit 540 wfla. So came home flipped it on anad again i 
just missed her LOL.
&gt;    
&gt;   I should get a membership there i listen enough but I havent yet.
&gt;    
&gt;   Oh and I did your 470 hack...great video like I said I felt I 
could do it and I DID do it. Hacked the radio no problem its scanning 
as it should be, but in process of taking apart and putting back 
together a wire popped loose and had to be taken to a friends to be 
soldered. Got it back hiome was about to put it together again and 
theres another long wire popped off pokin out LOL first one was to 
battery compartment second was to speaker....
&gt;    
&gt;   So took that and resoldered it back on...got it home put it 
together turned it on and its scanning its scanning...its 
static...all static...no stations now LOL
&gt;    
&gt;   Last week when I was on the phone ordering it there were voices 
and I recorded them as I spoke on the phone to the guy and while he 
stuck me on hold. They pretty much told me dont mess with that 
method. Too bad I didnt hear it til after I finished ordering LOL
&gt;    
&gt;   Oh well. C&#x27;est la vie!
&gt;    
&gt;   And next time you are in friggin Cocoa beach let some of us know 
we are in Florida right down the road from there in orlando =)
&gt;    
&gt;   I dunno if I am gonna mess with that rs radio anymore. I am 
thinkin that they didnt approve and I screwed somethin up to help 
reinforce that notion. Maybe send it to one of you guys to poke at or 
tear apart.
&gt;    
&gt;   So are you and bruce and Steve workin together? I heard 
the &quot;radio show&quot; announcement and saved the link to go back and 
listen (need to make those suckers downloadable even if its off 
esnips or somewhere LOL) so we can play em in the car on the way 
to/from work. I clicked to save from download but it only wants to 
play and not &quot;save as&quot;
&gt;    
&gt;   Great job on the videos too. Really proud of you for getting that 
out there and being so professional about it and hell you even talked 
be into tearing one open and modifying it. I still say I did it right 
because it scans like it is supposed to. I just think somethin else 
popped off that wont let it pick up stations now. Worked fine before 
I touched it anyway LOL
&gt;    
&gt;   Ok I am done rambling now. Thats 2 questions one bout the podcast 
of REG and one on your show on steves link.
&gt;    
&gt;   LOL
