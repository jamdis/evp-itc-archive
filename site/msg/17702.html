<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

Frank, you&#x27;ve been fair... more fair than I&#x27;d be, in a similar situation.

I&#x27;m not hearing anything new or interesting from the complainers and critics.  

I&#x27;m here for conversations about... well, exactly what you said, &quot;what these voices are, and how to hear it and interpret it better.&quot;

Might some of this be pareidolia?  Of course.  We&#x27;re not stupid... or at least most of us aren&#x27;t.  Is ALL of it pareidolia?  Not a chance.

So let&#x27;s get back to what&#x27;s interesting: Searching for what the voices are, how to hear and interpret what they&#x27;re saying, and which ones to take seriously.  Let&#x27;s find ways to hear them so even the most adamant skeptic must concede that something interesting is going on here.  

(Of course, the very fact that they&#x27;re still reading this list suggests that, in their heart of hearts, they do find the voices interesting, and deeply want to believe.)

Cheerfully,
Fiona

&gt;  I took the skeptics off moderation in a mistaken effort to be fair, but all this does is disrupt the conversation about what these voices are, and how to hear it and interpret it better. This group is not about how to explain all the inconvenient truths away.
