The top board is all that needs to be lifted.  \nI became too aggressive and had the whole dang thing tore apart. I \njust lifted the board up and identified the 7th wire from the right \nmatching up with the MU on the bottom board (needed a flashlight to \nsee real good) and pushed my Xacto hobby knife through the wire.  By \nthe way, if the SW button up top is not in properly when re-\nassembling the radio, it can prevent the radio from functioning if it \nis stuck in the &quot;on&quot; position.  The button is not needed if you lose \nit down inside the radio.\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I took the radio apart to take some pictures to show the hack and \ni&#39;m \n&gt; not really sure why some had problems.  I think maybe some may have \n&gt; messed with the bottom board.  You only need to access the top \nboard \n&gt; with the LCD display and there is nothing that will fall off except \nthe \n&gt; 2 buttoms that control the light and SW band selector, both can \neasily \n&gt; be put on after the hack in a matter of seconds.  I posted some \n&gt; pictures and a detailed description on my site, so you can see the \n&gt; procedure.  It took 5 minutes the first time, but after looking at \nit \n&gt; again it could probably be done faster but take your time with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The details are at www.keyportparanormal.com and look for the \nfolder on \n&gt; the left that says &quot;Simple Ghost Box Hack&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
