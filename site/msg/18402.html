Thanks for the info QweeQweg.=C2=A0 I had not heard that before, but I will=
 incorporate your advice on the future experiments.

Hey there Rasterer,

Just going on the things I have read on the net about =
remote viewing, and the practitioners I have spoken too, could I politley s=
uggest that you use a none electronic field generating object to place your=
 target on, as from what I can gather, objects of this type make it difficu=
lt to 'see' the target. I know that this counts for people doing rv work, I=
 guess it could make it difficult for a box to 'see' also?

Kind regards

This experiment is intended for =
those interested in exploring the Remote Viewing capabilities of their Ghos=
t Box's, EVP recorders. or even personal clairvoyant or precognitive capabi=
lities  And to maybe even have a little fun here.



On Friday, 7/30/2010 I=
 placed an object on top of my computer monitor, right in front of me, and =
will leave it there until noon Denver time on Monday, 8/2/2010.   This expe=
riment asks for participants to determine what that object is. Vague or par=
tial answers won't be counted (for example, just giving a color, shape, siz=
e,  what it's made of, etc): we're looking for what it is. Answers anyone r=
eveals after noon Denver time Monday won't count.  Participants can use the=
ir ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means they chose.  At the end o=
f the experiment, I will reveal the object, and a tally of the number of co=
rrect and/or incorrect answers.



In order to keep me honest, I have taken=
 a picture of the object at the start of the experiment and loaded it to th=
e Files section (RJ folder) of this group.  The idea with this file is that=
 you can download it now and 'keep it safe' on your computer. Then at the e=
nd of the experiment, I will post the password so you can reveal the conten=
ts of the file. That way, you were in control of the original image during =
the entire test, not me.  



Password pdf: http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/=
group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ20100730. pdf



And if you do not care to downl=
oad the pdf file now, I will post the final image there at the end of the e=
xperiment anyway.



My monitor is one of the older box-like SONY CRTs, and=
 says "Trinitron" and  "Multiscan 200sf" on the upper front.   I have a cou=
ple monitors stacked in my closet too: they are not the monitors used in th=
is experiment (they are not plugged in, and have nothing else on them anywa=
y), and I have several laptops around: they are also not the monitors in th=
is experiment.  The monitor in this experiment is the only SONY monitor I h=
ave, says "SONY in various places on it, and can be seen in the following l=
ink from the first experiment, when the correct answer would have been "rad=
io":

Please post all answers to the group thread: that way, there wil=
l be a public record and I won't get accused of losing any answers. Any ans=
wers sent directly to me, I will repost on the public thread.
