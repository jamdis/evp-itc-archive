Right...gotcha. Sound is a bi-product more or less.

        EM=
 waves at the VLF and ULF level can give off sound but only as a secondary =
phenomenon. It sounds like a low hum to some people! I believe the most fam=
ous of these phenomenon was caused by HAARP.

          So everything can be define=

               April, standard physics today defines four fundamental types=
 of forces: electromagnetism, gravity,  and the strong and weak interaction=
 of elementary particles.  So while EM is one type of energy (well, lets ca=
ll it a force), there are a few others too.

                            Tell m=
e where the seperation on the spectrum takes place between 300Hz and 300KHz=
. Yes, soundwaves cause pressure waves that our ears read as vibration and =
our mind translates as sound. The waves are still on the electromagnetic sp=
ectrum. Even subsonic geomagnetic waves are present on the scale. What I me=
an by power can be directll translated to volume or amplitude. The only thi=
ng that distinguishes soundwaves from any other wave is the fact that we ca=
n hear them.

                                No. Sounds waves are not on the e=
lectromagnet spectrum nor are they a form of electromagnet energy. Sound wa=

                                A mistake that a lot =
of people make is thinking that there are two different types of energy at =
work when it comes to sound waves and electromagnetic waves. The only thing=
 that seperates them is frequency and power. Radio waves are radio waves be=
cause they occupy a certain block of the electromagnietic spectrum. Sound w=
aves exist on that same spectrum just farther down with much longer waves. =
Soundwaves and subsonic waves can penetrate almost anything because of thei=
r wavelengths. The shorter the wavelength the more ways we can shield again=
st them.

                                Think of microwaves. These are al=
so a type of radio and telemetry transmitting wave but the waves also have =
a physical effect on our environment by causing molecules to speed up, whic=
h creates heat. A little lower than this is IR or infrared it too can cause=
 physical objects to heat up but usually it just causes molecules to rotate=
 in place. All physical things give off IR light. Its a way the total syste=
m conserves energy by spontaneously emitting IR radiation.

                                Here is some food for thought. I am curre=

                 =
               It was me and another girl teammate present in the room. I p=
icked up a 3rd female voice on my digital voice recorder that I carry with =
me. We were standing right next to another digital video recorder that I le=
ave beside my night vision camera. That recorder did not pick up this 3rd v=
oice. I have asked the girl that was with me to check her recording to see =
if she picked it up.

                                I have long felt the =
true EVP does not come from sound waves in the environment, or then it woul=
dn't be EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow EVP's are appearing directly =
on the recordings.

                                This instance with the =
recorders may back that theory up. That other recorder should have picked t=
hat voice up if it were sound waves in the environment.

                  =
              I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. The file that is n=
amed "01-02-17 Clip" is the full clip. You will hear my voice as I say "Yea=
h", and then another comes in right after that. I think I know what it says=
.

                                Again, I was live monitoring my audio, b=
ut still did not hear this until playback. It isn't clear, so I am not as e=
xcited about it as my one's from the last investigation.

                          I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an=
 untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It=
 works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that d=
iffer one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them together yo=
u get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is s=
ending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating an=
 untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate difference=
 frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This w=
as just an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic signa=
ls just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP were ge=
nerated within a few inches of the recorder.

ant it to manifest. It works off the 
                                heter=

       if you add or subtract them together you get a
