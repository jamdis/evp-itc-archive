&gt; I have a question for those of you who have been doing this research
&gt; for a while.  Since doing the research, have you noticed an increase
&gt; in your &quot;intuitive&quot; senses?  By that I mean, has your hearing been
&gt; heightened to the point of hearing conversations when you are alone? 
&gt; Or seeing things more clearly spirit wise?  Or am I just nuts and need
&gt; to be committed?  
&gt; 
&gt; I had to ask.  It&#x27;s a very strange thing.  These things have been
&gt; happening to me and I&#x27;m wondering if you have experienced the same
&gt; thing or close to it.
