 [EVP-ITC] New ideas








I have a running theory that EVP is carried on=
 an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest.=
 It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves tha=
t differ one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them together=
 you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost i=
s sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating=
 an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate differe=
nce=C2=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz)=
. This was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultrason=
ic signals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP=
 were generated within a few inches of the recorder.
=C2=A0
We are able to =
reproduce this affect in not only radio with superheterodyne systems but al=
so with acoustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a commercial prod=
uce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.
