Frank - you&#39;re not qualified to use your box, better go get\ntraining from Chris.  Better yet, we should change the name of this\ngroup to Haunted Times EVP-ITC (tm).\n\nMy question is, who certified the certifier?  Maybe we should start\nour own certification club and state anyone who&#39;s not training from us\nis not certified.  I&#39;m sure some of you could use the money a lot\nmore?  That way we can all be certified.  Or would that makes us\ncertifiable? ;)\n\nMarty"}
