Sorry Frank   I lost the EVP attachment for your Tones Only recording...or maybe I just don't know how to access it.   Possibly you can forward it to me again.  ron

  I can hear that. Interesting it was at the -75% because most of the h2o voices reside in the -74% region. Theres a few that are in normal time/speed but since I record for short amount of time using that method (30 seconds or so) most things are said very quickly and cant be heard until you slow it down to the magic number -74% speed.
