Thanks for the advice Misty! Ive learned my way around computers over the years, but this is too weird and it definnitly corresponds to how much Im progressing with the contacts I am trying to maintain. Asking it to stop seems to invite worse. This interference has (I suspect) an intent and Ive found that the best fix is ignoring this stuff...in any case..Its good to know Im not the only one whos gone through this....so gathering my dignity...anyone here know if theres any reason to be concerned about EMF levels? I sure am getting mild flu like symptoms fairly regularly...used to be "not so mild"
Light,

Not uncommon in this work Monki. If ya lived close enough I could fix it for ya but not sure where on the east coast you are residing (yes guys I can fix pc's LOL =P but no that doesnt make me the tech type...practice makes perfect). I went thru two computers in a months time, fried everything completely right down to the last chip. Appliances dont last long at my house (near me) and tv's, vcr's, backups units...u name it I have fried it. It finally stopped when I asked them to stop whatever they were doing that was putting so much pressure on my machinery. Now they say Otto is in charge of equipment, and havent had much problems on my end. 
   
  Email weirdness is also common I have watched mine and others emails disappear, then sometimes show up later with changes made in the wording of the message. Retro Dave has bore the brunt of the email problems LOL I just had it happen once when I responded to his postings of having problems.  My post disappeared then came back changed/edited. Thats been a long time ago tho. 
   
  After saying all that you should of course check the basics, make sure everything is plugged up properly, see if anything feels extremely hot (if it is shut it down immediately to cool) then ya may wanna pop the lid off the tower of the pc to check inside and remove the sound card, clean the contacts, then replace it to see if that helps. UNPLUG IT FROM ELECTRIC FIRST! If that doesnt help then you may need to replace the part. Keep an eye on temperatures if something is running hot sometimes it will cause the metal to swell/bend/melt/move.

I hear from other researchers that this is not uncommon.Im losing stuff quickly. Ill be outta business before long! Is there a safeguard for this? Anyone had these things happen to them?
Ive wondered if emf protection might be in order...I hope I dont sound completely madd!(besides, its the Madd Hatter thats got that covered. Im actually more like Alice...clueless! So...SOS!
