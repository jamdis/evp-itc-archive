The parts I didnt agree on, some of it \nI notice he is one of those who has been fed some of those \nmisconceptions floating around out there about Frank and his work.\n\nThat is one of many reasons why I think its important Frank stay \nactive and speak for HIMSELF =)\n\nI hope he does continue experimenting on a regular basis. We all know \nit takes effort. He says he believes theres something paranormal just \ndoesnt believe in everything thats being fed to the public. I cant \nsay that is a bad thing. I have watched quite a few skeptical minds \nwalk into this thinking man this is a load of crap, that all seems to \nchange when they hear thier full name and direct comments aimed at \nthem specifically with details that usually make them think twice. \n\nIf anything I would wish him good luck and I hope they do choose to \nspeak with him directly =)\n\nMisty\n\n \n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; LMAO!
