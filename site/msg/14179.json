You c=\r\nan go smaller, but not larger.\n\n          When you enlarge a digital photo,=\r\n the photo gets stretched, but the same amount of pixels have to now fill i=\r\nn, so they get larger, which magnifies the pixelation. You end up with a bl=\r\nocky &quot;lo-res&quot; image. You can choose to have it &quot;resample&quot;, but then you get=\r\n what RJ described, where the program looks at the existing pixels and add =\r\npixels that are an average of the surrounding pixels. So you still end up w=\r\nhat a grainy, digital looking picture.\n\n          When saving a photo to a =\r\ncompressed format, such as jpeg, you actually loose data, or pixels. The pr=\r\nogram decides which data to drop to make the file smaller. Each time you op=\r\nen and resave, you loose more data.The resolution gets worse and worse.\n\n  =\r\n        This is the same thing that happens with audio files, you loose dat=\r\na each time you save it to a compressed format.\n\n            ----- Original=\r\n Message ----- \n            From: Rj \n            To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .=\r\ncom \n            Sent: Sunday, May 10, 2009 10:54 AM\n            Subject: R=\r\ne: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n\n\n\n                  Pixelization doesn&#39;t=\r\n clean-up the data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking a picture of a field of=\r\n flowers, and beginning to add levels or pixelization to the picture.  Soon=\r\n, you would not be able to tell there were flowers there at all.  You would=\r\n see a lot of colored blocks.\n\n                  Or in the other direction,=\r\n imagine you are looking at a competely randomize bunch of pixes on your sc=\r\nreen: a complete screen of truely random static snow.  Pixelizing this, aft=\r\ner a while, you would again start to see colored blocks.\n\n                 =\r\n What&#39;s happening is that it is processing an area of the image, taking (fo=\r\nr instance) the average value of that entire area, and replacing all the bl=\r\nocks in that area with the average.  In video processing, this would result=\r\n in a field of multi-colored flowers being replaced by, for instance, a big=\r\n greyish-bluish block, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the noise exampl=\r\ne, it maybe replace all the random pixels with another big greyish-bluish b=\r\nlock.  If you did not know beforehand what the original picture was, you co=\r\nuldn&#39;t tell whether your pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a c=\r\nhevy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.\n\n                  =\r\nIt works the same with the sound files.  Taking something as complex as spe=\r\nech, and replacing frequencies with their averages, loses the speech the fa=\r\nrther you go, until you head strange fluctuating square waves.  Doing the s=\r\name to random static will eventually produce the same thing.  And random fl=\r\nuctuating square waves can sound a bit like speech - or at least, you could=\r\n have fun sharing with each other what you thing they &#39;sound like&#39;.\n\n\n\n\n\n  =\r\n                --- On Sun, 5/10/09, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt; wr=\r\note:\n\n\n                    From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt;\n      =\r\n              Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n                 =\r\n   To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n                    Date: Sunday, May 10, 2=\r\n009, 9:29 AM\n\n\n                          I always save the whole file in wa=\r\nv format then do my clips as mp3.

While some formats (like =\r\nwav) can store the audio very close to the way it was recorded, formats lik=\r\ne mp3 compress the file, and in so doing lose some of the sonic details.  T=\r\nhis may not be a big deal in music, where the audio is fairly clear to begi=\r\nn with.  But with sound sources with a lot of noise (like evps), this can n=\r\not only obscure any real sounds, but pixelize non-sounds (like white noise)=\r\n and make them start to sound like speech.\n\n                               =\r\n So mp3 might be good for sharing the data, once you&#39;ve already formed an o=\r\npinion based on an analysis of the wav file.  But mp3 is not good as a medi=\r\num for analysis.

Imagine taking a picture of a field of=\r\n \n                  flowers, and beginning to add levels or pixelization to=\r\n the \n                  picture.&nbsp; Soon, you would not be able to tell =\r\nthere were \n                  flowers there at all.&nbsp; You would see a l=\r\not of colored \n                  blocks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Or in the other direction, =\r\nimagine you are \n                  looking at a competely randomize bunch o=\r\nf pixes on your \n                  screen: a complete screen of truely rand=\r\nom static snow.&nbsp; \n                  Pixelizing this, after a while, yo=\r\nu would again start to see \n                  colored blocks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What&#39;s=\r\n happening is that it is \n                  processing an area of the image=\r\n, taking (for instance) the \n                  average value of that entire=\r\n area, and replacing all the \n                  blocks in that area with th=\r\ne average.&nbsp; In video \n                  processing, this would result =\r\nin a field of multi-colored \n                  flowers being replaced by, f=\r\nor instance, a big greyish-bluish \n                  block, with no resembl=\r\nance to flowers.&nbsp; In the noise \n                  example, it maybe re=\r\nplace all the random pixels with another \n                  big greyish-blu=\r\nish block.&nbsp; If you did not know beforehand \n                  what the=\r\n original picture was, you couldn&#39;t tell whether your \n                  pi=\r\nxelized image was really a field of flowers, a chevy, the \n                =\r\n  sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It works \n          =\r\n        the same with the sound files.&nbsp; Taking something as \n         =\r\n         complex as speech, and replacing frequencies with their \n         =\r\n         averages, loses the speech the farther you go, until you head \n   =\r\n               strange fluctuating square waves.&nbsp; Doing the same to \n =\r\n                 random static will eventually produce the same thing.&nbsp=\r\n; \n                  And random fluctuating square waves can sound a bit li=\r\nke \n                  speech - or at least, you could have fun sharing with=\r\n each \n                  other what you thing they &#39;sound \n                =\r\n  like&#39;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Sun, 5/10/09, Misty \n            =\r\n      Dawn &lt;I&gt;&lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
