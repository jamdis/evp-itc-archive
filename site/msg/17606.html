April,

I have received EVP's during ghost=
 box sessions. One  thing that bugs me 
about doing sessions is that you ca=
n never be sure  whether the clear 
communications received are EVP or box =
related. It has  been shown in studies that 
EVP's can be received in a vac=
uum so even  recording a session with using the 
line out may capture EVP's=
 (but probably  is much less likely to do so).

This clip is from June 2009=
 at Rolling  Hills Asylum. I am sure that this 
is an EVP because it my rec=
order was set  up about 12 feet from the shack 
hack and it was the only re=
corder from that  session to pick up this audio. 
This is a genuine Class A=
 EVP, which is a  rare thing. 

We were conducting a session and you can he=
ar the cycle  through ending and 
starting again. We were just about to end=
 the session and  had just called 
for any last minute communications when =
this clip occurred.  

I use Google Chrome as a browser, so and it has prob=
lems with  attachments.
