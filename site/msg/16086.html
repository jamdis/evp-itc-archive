<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Not to mention that when they want to &quot;test&quot; something they are already skeptical about, then they will come up with impossible criteria. The day I finally stopped caring why a ghost box worked and just accepted that it did was the start of rewarding sessions. 

I think most of us are beyond the point where skeptics can make a dent in our searching for answers. Skepticism can be good, but sometimes it can be self defeating. More people just want to make a name for themselves by trying to be the one that brought down this or that device. If they would try some of these methods with an open mind and a brief suspension of disbelief, then they might get their own rewarding experiences as well...

&gt;  Well then, just build youself a box and test the hell out of it!
&gt; 
&gt;  I&#x27;ve said all along that one has to be careful not to create the voices/answers one wants to hear. We are, despite appearances, spirit, and we can create our own spirit voices just as easy as any other entity. But what do I know, I just make the damn boxes and I don&#x27;t even believe in ghost hunting!?
&gt; 
&gt;  Whatever these brainiacs claim that want to do all this testing--they never-ever ask the freaking inventors! They can&#x27;t even get their heads around EVPmaker, so pretend that doesn&#x27;t even exist, even though the box came later. Probably they think it would be easier to disprove the box. Some duffus puts a DR. in front of his name and I&#x27;m supposed to be impressed, it just means all intellect has been programmed out. After all , they &quot;know&quot; there are no spirits, so it has to be something else--anything else!
