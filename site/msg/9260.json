It stands to reason (we are the air breathing people)\nthey are in spirit and we refer to them as such. So I am beginning to \nthink their reference to us is air people. \n\nWhere the speculation earlier in the experiments was that the mention \nof air people meant themselves because they where not solid physical \nbodies. but made of spirit.\n\nJust something to chew on, and give us a research related topic to \ndiscuss.\n\nWhen you listen to the file especially for you new people please read \nthe description as the message is rather long and may be hard for new \npeople that are not accustomed to listening to this type of file may \nhave trouble keeping up.\n\nlet me know your take on what the reference to air people is in this \nmessage. and then I will post my interpretation.\n\nBruce"}
