It's been some months since I had applied to this group and eventhough I don't log into it very often I am always reading the updates on subjects.All of them.I may not know Frank personally,nor do I even know who allowed me in the group,but I wouldn't have asked to join if there wasn't something in here I beleive.Ever since I saw the first usage of that box on a paranormal show,I knew something new has evolved.The ideas and thoughts behind the makings and application if such a device still astounds me.Whenever there comes something new and amazing to the public eye there are always balkers and naysayers,not to mention fanpeople as well.I dont know which are more harmful.All I know is that those of us who have been exposed to something that we cannot explain and those who have been fortunate enough to own such a device appreciate the work that was put forth.I'd tip my hat if I wore one.Would a nod of my glasses do?
