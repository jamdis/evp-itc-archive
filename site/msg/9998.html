Read my updated post  . I have had  some time  to rethink  my  th=
oughts on this. I  stated  in my updated post that after 10 sec. if you hav=
e no response then you get  nothing. But then the raw file would be 10 sec =
or less. Ass far as saying I=92m a better researcher  than you . I am talki=
ng about all the researching I have done. You defiantly have more experienc=
e  than me with  the box. But  I  have been to way more locations than you,=
 and   the box is a small part of  what I=92m doing. In the paranormal all =
you have is your reputation  and were talking 10 sec  clips here  nothing  =
more than that. So why  clip them?     I  agree with you    that splicing t=
hem and clipping them is  not  fraud at all, and never accused you of that =
 you should know better .    But on the other hand this my view  and  were =
I hold myself and my research .let me state  for all  . I have never nor wi=

Joel,
 
I don't think anyo=
ne would wait 30 seconds after a question and 
associate a word or phrase t=
o be the answer to that question.
 
Also in a thirty second period if the r=
esearcher has not asked another question and moved on
someone should try an=
d help them with how they are doing a session.
 
You Know I clip all the us=
eless fragment crap out of my files, are you trying to say you hold your re=
search to a higher
degree than I do?
 
And because the crap sounds are cut =
from a file does not make it pieced together.
If a researcher is taking wor=
ds from different parts of a recording and putting them together to make a =
sentence
that would be piecing them together, that would be an out and out =
fake.
 
As long as the researcher has the original clip to present upon req=
uest by a reputable source, that should prevent
questions of the files vali=
dity.

I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the r=

Subject: [EVP-ITC=
] Editing EVP
Hi all,

just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientifi=
c reasons, I would
suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only a=
s a whole, in
order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You=
 can for
instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (includ=
ing
the experimenter' s voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, bu=
t
not cut out individual pieces (supposed "garbage") to make an EVP match
w=
ith what it "should be". At least, the unedited version should always
be pr=
ovided along with the edited version.

But that's only my personal opinion =
which I thought I had to express, as
we should always be able to present ou=
r results to a critical public.

Stefan
