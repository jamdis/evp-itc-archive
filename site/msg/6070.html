<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce,
Thank you so much for the info...I&#x27;m so excited to start this type of
communication.  Thank you to all that have helped me to begin my new
endeavor.

Carol B.










&gt; Carol B.,
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m sure you will associate me with the hoopla that took place yesterday.
&gt; I must apologise for my conduct. Please understand this is not a typical
&gt; thing here
&gt; it is a rare occasion.
&gt;
&gt; To answer your question, I have been a long time researcher and do
&gt; research daily with every box that is available today
&gt; including a Frank&#x27;s box.
&gt;
&gt; If you already have your RS box and it is modified, you are 75% of the way
&gt; there.
&gt; I will explain in detail how to do a successful session.
&gt; Let your spirit friends know you are about to turn the box on and ask if
&gt; they would please join you in a communication session.
&gt; Turn on your recording device(whichever you choose to record the session)
&gt; state the date and time and number the session so you have a referral at a
&gt; later date.
&gt; Turn your RS box on and start the scan. I prefer and always use the AM
&gt; band to do a session, it is less cluttered than FM and I find it easier to
&gt; hear real time messages and answers.
&gt; At first you can ask simple questions that will require short answers such
&gt; as &quot; are there any spirits listening that wish to communicate with me&quot;
&gt; &quot;can you say my name&quot;, &quot; can you tell me your name&quot; questions along those
&gt; line will glean short understandable answers and messages. Not only for
&gt; hearing in real time but also later when reviewing the recording.
&gt;
&gt; It will take time for you to develop what we call an ear for hearing the
&gt; communication, that just means your listening skills during a session will
&gt; become more honed and acute to the messages and answers being sent. Do not
&gt; get discouraged if you do not hear any responses the first couple of
&gt; sessions. Our friends need time to adjust to a new researcher and assign
&gt; you a technician.
&gt; But you can rest assured the communication will come.
&gt;
&gt; Keep the sessions to a limit of 10 to 15 minutes as to not overwhelm
&gt; yourself when you need to listen back carefully to the recording or stress
&gt; the energy supply of your spirit contacts.
&gt;
&gt; When you are done with your session let your spirit friends know you are
&gt; about to end the session and turn the box off and give them about ten
&gt; seconds before you do turn the box off.
&gt;
&gt; extend the same courtesy as you would speaking to someone on the phone,
&gt; say goodbye and thank you and you will almost always get a cordial
&gt; response.
&gt;
&gt; shut your box and again thank them for their efforts. you have now done a
&gt; rudimentary box session. load it onto the computer and review it for
&gt; messages and answers to your question that you missed during the live
&gt; session. when you have done this post a message to the board and I will
&gt; explain how to do a basic edit of the recording to better understand the
&gt; responses that are less clear.
&gt;
&gt; good luck Carol and I am looking forward to researching with you.
&gt;
&gt; Bruce
