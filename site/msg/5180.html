steve,
 
very well said, It goes without saying that this is all pure theo=
ry based on personal experience.
but as you know we also recieve advice and=
 knowledge from our friends on the other side from time to time
and that he=
lps us formulate the theories we do. On the premiss of the absentee session=

until further experimentation is done or further =

Nick,J=
ust so you know that all this is just personal opinions and i don't believe=
 that Bruce stressed that to you in the post. Every researcher has their ow=
n opinions on how it is done and the results have varied amongst us. There =
is no way to actually explain to someone how these devices work, i couldn't=
 tell you that leaving the box on will make it imprint because there are no=
 facts based on this research thus far. Only personal opinions have been pu=
t out there and what we have experienced for ourselves up to this point. Ev=
erybody needs to do their own research with a little helping hand from thos=
e who have been doing this a little while longer and that's it. You will fi=
nd your own niche in this communication and teach what you've learned to ot=
hers one day. Just remember that nobody can tell how it should be, because =
there is no proof only some personal experiences. That covers all paranorma=

as a long time researcher is not to just turn the box on and leave it runni=

 with one ear as you do something else, you will hear a loud curse word or =
nasty statement, that is their way of getting your attention back. I have g=
otten numerous messages about the difficulty of the attempts for them to co=
mmunicate so when I turn the box on it gets my full attention. just some ex=
perienced advice. As for them telling you to close the portal, it could hav=
e two meanings. Sometimes they refer to box thatis turned on and in use as =
a portal for the simple reason that each time we turn a box on to communica=
te it opens a direct open link between our realm and theirs so in essence i=
t is an open door for anything to pass in or out. that is why when I end a =
session I always ask my technician to bring back any spirits that may have =
come through the portal during the session and I ask for conformation and 1=
0 times out of ten will get "OK" or "OK THEY ARE BACK" also they may have m=
eant since you had the box running and where not doing a actual session to =
shut the box so that they could go and not have to protect the open connect=
ion from any negative entities that where able cross through the openportal=

7 within the past month. The only known significance that the number 7 has =
in evp research is the 7 entities that controlled communication back in the=
 eighties and ninetiesduring the spiricom and luxembourg era. To receive th=
is number in messages so often and by more than one researcher, odiouslyhol=
