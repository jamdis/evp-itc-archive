<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce--is this in reference to something I&#x27;m not seeing?

I listen to every file posted, but a lot of the time I don&#x27;t have  
anything intelligent to say other than &quot;I hear it,&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t.&quot; I  
also don&#x27;t always listen until I have a group of items days later.  
That doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t listen or don&#x27;t care.

&gt; This group has turned into a first grade class when the teacher leaves

&gt;
&gt; It&#x27;s supposed to be about a free exchange of idea&#x27;s concerning evp-itc
&gt; not a mud slinging forum or a research bashing arena.
&gt;
&gt; Frank, myself and Steve are continuously posting files and asking for
&gt; feedback and for the last three months I have gotten maybe one or two
&gt; responses to my posts and files and I don&#x27;t think Steve has gotten  
&gt; any.
&gt; also it seems like the only reason everyone jumps to reply to a post
&gt; that frank makes is because he is the man with the boxes, I know there
&gt; will be a 100 posts now saying &quot;OH THATS NOT TRUE AT ALL&quot; but be truth
&gt; full with yourselves and you will find that it is.
&gt;
&gt; I myself are guilty of that to a certain extent and I have a Frank&#x27;s
&gt; box already. lets all stop the bull and play nice. Let&#x27;s try to  
&gt; further
&gt; the research and work together with positive feedback or CONSTRUCTIVE
&gt; criticism, CONSTRUCTIVE being the key word.
