<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>HaHa maybe your going to have to fight about whats better the box or 
soapsound.

I personnally dont like the robotic sounding voice with the 
soapsound. You can never tell whos talking everyone sounds the 
same.

&gt; Yeah, i think i hear that too.  I&#x27;m probably going to just scrap 
this 
&gt; session, i spent 2 hours going over 45 seconds to bring out a 
message 
&gt; that&#x27;s so unclear to everyone else.  It&#x27;s so frustrating that the 
&gt; radio method is so flawed, i want it to be clear and it never is.  
&gt; And if i do get something that&#x27;s interesting, most people will say 
&gt; it&#x27;s just radio anyway.  That&#x27;s why i&#x27;m trying to get away from 
the 
&gt; radios, although it&#x27;s robotic sounding---sound soap has been the 
best 
&gt; so far.  Clearer and longer messages, with hardly any editing.  
The 
&gt; boxes are unable to get full sentences from them and i don&#x27;t care 
&gt; what anybody else claims to get.  You will get some good &quot;yes&quot; 
&gt; and &quot;no&quot; answers, but the rest will be questioned and heard 
&gt; differently by others.  What does everyone else on this board 
think 
&gt; about this?
