<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I get it...I think it&#x27;s the intent of the user to communicate.  I get voices

&gt;  No one gets it! It&#x27;s not &quot;the box&quot;, it is supplying a *raw audio* that
&gt; the entities use to form voices. *Raw audio==bits of speech.* There are in
&gt; fact other methods that result in clearer communication. Even white noise,
&gt; while producing weak voices, it&#x27;s still clearer voices. Another method,
&gt; perhaps my favorite is the Foreign language method, tuning in a foreign
&gt; shortwave broadcast in a language I don&#x27;t understand, and after announcing
&gt; I&#x27;m doing an EVP recording, record directly for the radio&#x27;s speaker. There
&gt; is tuning an AM radio between stations when there are skip conditions,
&gt; distant stations fading in and out randomly.
&gt;
&gt;  Radio seems to be an important element in these communications, but the
&gt; fact is, &quot;the box&quot; is not the only way. With using EVPmaker, the radio is
&gt; eliminated, so the importance of the radio element is debatable. You can do
&gt; the foreign language method via the Internet, see coffeepotghost.com
&gt;
&gt;  You can use &quot;crowd noise&quot;, like recording in a shopping mall, or
&gt; restaurant, try to say, or at least think &quot; I&#x27;m doing an EVP recording&quot;, you
&gt; get meaningful messages made out of the  mix of normal voices.
&gt;
&gt;  I use &quot;the box&quot; simply because is it convinient, not because it is the
&gt; best method. Sweeping a radio is a quick, and easy way to produce *raw
&gt; audio*. Ten years I try to get this across, might as well tell it to my
&gt; dogs!

&gt;&gt; In my opinion there are a hand full of inventers that have achieved fame
&gt;&gt; in the GB field. As I understand it they all are riding on the coat tales of
&gt;&gt; our very own Frank S. Every GB out there is a spin on a Franks box even the
&gt;&gt; ones that use a speech chip. The bottom line is that all the box&#x27;s out there
&gt;&gt; rely on snippets of speech that the spirit world can try and use to
&gt;&gt; communicate with us. If you think about it there all spun up Frank&#x27;s Box&#x27;s.
&gt;&gt; What I&#x27;m getting at is that Frank has the fame market cornered and right
&gt;&gt; fully so. Unless you are some sort of a wiz bang electrical engineer you
&gt;&gt; might as well forget about becoming famous building GB&#x27;s.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The whole idea of using kit 23 (function generator) to sweep a radio and
&gt;&gt; make a Frank&#x27;s box knock off was to bring an inexpensive GB to the group
&gt;&gt; that would work better then a hack and not earn a merit badge in GB
&gt;&gt; building. At the time it was a good idea because this group was all about
&gt;&gt; the communication . It was extremely interesting and it looked like this
&gt;&gt; group just might take GBC to some level of understanding and even
&gt;&gt; consistency in the communication. If someone wants to achieve fame through
&gt;&gt; the GB community I believe that&#x27;s the direction to go in. I doubt that you
&gt;&gt; will have any compition and get lots of help from this group.
