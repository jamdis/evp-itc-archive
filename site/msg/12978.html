<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This was in the former Manteno State Mental Hospital in Illinois.  A few 
of them gave names.  Someone who had access to the records looked up the 
names later on and they were the names of former patients who died there. 
The records gave the date and cause of death. They were NOT common names 
like &quot;John Smith&quot;.

How would anyone on an EVP know the names of people long forgotten for 
over 60 years? None of us present did. It is all so fascinating ...

&gt; You don&#x27;t. You just assume.
&gt;
&gt; Many people die in lots of places. People used to die at home all the time.
&gt; Are all old houses &quot;haunted&quot;? No.
&gt;
&gt; Energies are EVERYWHERE. Literally all over and though you might stereotype 
&gt; areas as &quot;haunted&quot;, you can get
&gt; the same results anywhere.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Leave this building.&quot; could have been said by any type of energy and not 
&gt; just human.
&gt;
&gt; It&#x27;s anybodies guess with what or who we are speaking with/hearing.
