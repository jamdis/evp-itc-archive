&gt; I agree, as I sent a private email to Frank, if one of them were 
hurting,
&gt; either one of them if a comet hit this Earth, I am sure  either one of
them
&gt; would reach out to save each other&#x27;s life, people say things  about
each
&gt; other when they get angry without meaning to, it&#x27;s more of a personal 
hurt
&gt; inside the self, it was wrong to send this is silly.  The only reason 
I came
&gt; back was because I did not have Frank&#x27;s address, now I do, so If I get
&gt; kicked off this list by anyone, so be it, but the reason I did come
back was
&gt; because Spirit were giving me Frank&#x27;s full name I thought it might be
someone
&gt; he  knew asking for him.  God Bless Us one and all,  sf

&gt; Due to the improper slanderous outburst of this individual, he has
been

everywhere
&gt; that states he is a professional. He is not!! and Yes Snow, he did
mean to
&gt; slight, and this is not the beginning, he slings to much for the
paranormal

BTW,
&gt; just a note....whom ever sent that letter to FS, hey YOU, what a sorry

&gt; &gt; Just  FYI--I&#x27;m not like these other clowns, proclaiming how great I
am!
&gt; I&#x27;ve
&gt; &gt;  said over and over I know the older boxes are just shit, and should
be
&gt; &gt;  thrown away. I also stated I&#x27;m no engineer, and it takes me a long
time
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; figure this stuff out, and it seems, few if anyone else can get 
this
&gt; stuff
&gt; &gt; to work at all. I don&#x27;t sell the stuff, no one is out  money, except
for
&gt; &gt; postage. I made no claims about how great my boxes  are.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Haliday cuts and pastes words together to form  impressive sounding
&gt; &gt; messages, then proclaims how great he is, and  that&#x27;s all this crap
is,
&gt; &gt; cutting someone else down for his own  benifit. The guy produces
nothing
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; his own, and can&#x27;t even spell  radio, let alone make one! How dare
you
&gt; &gt; (hiliday) cut me down!? Talk  about friggin&#x27; slander!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The world is full is these scumbags  all proclaiming how righteous,
how
&gt; &gt; conservative, how--whatever, the  darkside is everywhere! But what
really
&gt; &gt; makes it bad is the morons  that hang on every word from these show
&gt; clowns!
&gt; &gt; That &#x27;s why I say I  can&#x27;t really take offense, like they say,
consider
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; source.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So where&#x27;s my incentive to continue this work? Think I&#x27;ve spend 
enough
&gt; &gt; endless night in the basement!

AN

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bonnie,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The small 20-125 you have is light  years ahead of the Frank&#x27;s box
in the
&gt; &gt; quality of communication it  allows you to receive. I have had two
Frank&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; boxes #&#x27;s 12 and 29. #12  was stolen from me by a low life that took
&gt; &gt; advantage of my generosity.  That is another story.
&gt; &gt; I still have Frank&#x27;s box #29, the reason you  never hear files from
me
&gt; using
&gt; &gt; that box is because it literally  &quot;Sucks!&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Most if not all Frank&#x27;s boxes are inherently filled  with static
white
&gt; noise
&gt; &gt; and that combined with a metal echo box and  noise generator make it
very
&gt; &gt; difficult to hear anything let alone  communication which is
difficult
&gt; enough
&gt; &gt; to hear from a quiet box like  the 125.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Frank&#x27;s box has seen it&#x27;s day and served it&#x27;s  purpose in my opinion
it is
&gt; &gt; antiquated and is no where near the  quality of even a small cheap
RS
&gt; 12-469
&gt; &gt; as far as clarity of  communication.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Frank is actually using the guts from RS hacks  to build his boxes
now so
&gt; why
&gt; &gt; have a &quot;FRANKENBOX&quot; that is essentially  an RS hack with noise added
&gt; instead
&gt; &gt; of just buying an RS box and  getting better communication?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Mind you this is only my  opinion but it is based on years of
experience
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; every box that is  or has been used. I currently have 14 different
boxes
&gt; not
&gt; &gt; to mention  EVP maker and I have done extensive sessions and
research with
&gt; &gt; each  and for my money you can give me a 20-125 every time, the
Frank&#x27;s
&gt; box
&gt; &gt;  should be retired to the box museum where it belongs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am  the only person in this research that will come out and speak
the
&gt; truth
&gt; &gt; about the Frank&#x27;s box, there are many people now that have them  and
the
&gt; only
&gt; &gt; person you will ever hear a file from is Steve Hultay and  sometimes
Frank
&gt; &gt; himself, and Frank&#x27;s files are so rough you may hear 1  out of a
hundred
&gt; &gt; files the way he does due to the fact that he does  not even take
the
&gt; time to
&gt; &gt; do a proper session he just turns the box on  and records a couple
of
&gt; minute
&gt; &gt; using his CELL PHONE !
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Frank has his place in RTSC history due to his ALLEGED invention
off  the
&gt; &gt; first ghost box and he deserves the respect for his  &quot;POSSIBLE&quot;
&gt; &gt; accomplishment but to be revered as a god in the box field  NO not
by me
&gt; &gt; anyway.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I use the words &quot;ALLEGED&quot; and  &quot;POSSIBLE&quot; in terms of his being the
first
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; create the ghost box due  to some recent information that has been
&gt; brought to
&gt; &gt; my attention that  concerns an individual that created, built and
used A
&gt; &gt; Radio Sweeping  Ghost Box in 1969.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am gathering information and  documentation now and will hopefully
be
&gt; able
&gt; &gt; to dispel the myth of  Frank sumption being the father of the ghost
Box
&gt; soon.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That  is to be continued!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; All is possible,  nothing is probable
&gt; &gt;
