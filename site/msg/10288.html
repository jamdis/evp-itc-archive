<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s too bad one or two people ruin it for the rest of us.  Only 20% of 
the population have antisocial tendencies and only a couple percent are 
truly antisocial.  Sometimes it gets to you, but keep in mind it&#x27;s only a 
couple people. Also keep in mind the old Yank Latin saying, &quot;Non 
carborundum illegitimatus!&quot;

I joined this group ONLY because Frank S. was on it and I hoped to keep up 
on his research. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do now.

&gt; I didn&#x27;t read any resulting posts from what I posted earlier, and I&#x27;m not sure I want to. I&#x27;ve been doing this for some years now, and it seems like ya can&#x27;t go two weeks without someone that thinks they know more, or their &quot;theories&quot; are more valid, or someone that believes for whatever reason they are the box/EVP/paranormal expert. I&#x27;ve had enough, these groups are pointless, and I&#x27;m tired of the BS. There is always these incessant arguements with those that seem to think they know better than anyone else. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, and my over reactions, but at this point, I don&#x27;t care, enough is enough. So ya want the group? I don&#x27;t actually own it due to one of these idiotic arguements, but have at it, cuz I ain&#x27;t playing this game anymore. I&#x27;ll continue my own work, in my own time, and in my own way.
