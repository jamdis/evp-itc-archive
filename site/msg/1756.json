I have posted only the two messages in the file \nsection under bhali sweep and sound file folder. they are the only two \nfiles in there I deleted the rest so as not to use up to much space.\nThe first is it&#39;s me Mandy and the second is named long file and I \nbelieve it says &quot;awaiting something_ a man named Saul _he&#39;ll be asking \nfor Mandy_ he&#39;s from our side_ he&#39;s a rabbi&quot;\n\nplease let me know what you think. There are quite a few more and I&#39;m \nonly part way through the recording.\n\nBruce"}
