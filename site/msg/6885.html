      Robin,
       
      I very much a=
ppreciate your comments and confidence in me, but at the end of the day I'm=
 no different than anyone else.
      The only thing that may set me apart =
from some of the other researchers here is that I have a bit more experienc=
e and 
      being disabled allows me a lot more time for research. I am al=
ways willing and hopefully able to help new researchers with 
      my advi=
ce and knowledge I have gained through experience. But my ideology is not t=
he end all explanation or truth of box research
      all opinions here are=
 valuable and deserving of consideration and attention.
       
      As fo=
r your question, the fact that I am blessed enough to receive a fairly good=
 level of communication I believe is based once 
      again on the relatio=
nship I have built with my tech/guides and the synchronization of energy we=
 have developed.
      The level of communication we are at I believe is on=
ly the very tip of the iceberg. My goal in "MY" research is to reach a leve=
l of communication that 
      allows us to speak easily and freely with ou=
r spirit friends in a fluid and continual fashion as if having a pleasant t=
elephone conversation.
       
      The gist of the messages I am receivin=
g now are directed toward our spirit counterparts achieving the same goal. =
It is already a comfort to me to know they are there and I have had the opp=
ortunity to speak with close family members and friends that have crossed o=
ver. And also recently Ms. Sarah Estep who has made the transition and is b=
eginning to work now on the
      spirit side to further the communication.=
 Any information I receive from the spirits I recognise to be friends is in=
valuable. Something as simple as a yes or no answer to a direct question th=
at has just been asked is a small miracle in and of itself. considering how=
 it was attained and where it is from. Most researchers I think after a cer=
tain amount of time succumb to the human flaw of complacency and take for g=
ranted that when they turn a box on they will receive communication. They l=
oose site of the fact that this communication is a precious gift to mankind=
 and eventually will change the way we perceive life and death.
       
   =
   I don't know if my thinking or opinions are lucid or the rantings of a m=
ad man, I'm sure a lot of people would say both. For what it is worth this =
is how I believe on the questions you asked.
      for better or worse.

        It's always refreshing to read your input Bruc=
e.  Funny thing is, I recognize Mike and Lisa on your recordings too.  I'm =
aware that they are acting as facilitators and guardians, that they are con=
sistent in their ability to use varied modes of communication, and that the=
ir contact appears to be purposeful, as compared to so much that seems to h=
ave no rhyme or reason.  

        As a newbie I'm admittedly intimidated b=
y and in awe of the results you more experienced researchers are accomplish=
ing.  What I find most awesome is that everyone can have different methods,=
 belief systems and opinions and come together in one forum to share and le=
arn from one another.  I feel so lucky to have found you!  Bruce, your abil=
ity to hear and accurately repeat my one posted EVP is the only validation =
I've personally ever received that makes me know I'm involved in something =
real and life altering.  I'm supposed to be here!  I think a big part of my=
 education will continue to come from the knowledge and experience you all =
are willing to keep sharing.  It's also a fact that each of us needs to fin=
d his/her own individual truth.  

        I'm still troubled by the possib=
ility that we could be pawns in Someone Else's science experiment.  I can s=
ense Frank's cynicism related to the messages being meaningless and the mes=
sengers being untrustworthy.  In your own case, what is the goal?  Is the f=
act that you've established communication and continue to communicate enoug=
h?  Are we hoping to gain invaluable information from our guides, or just t=

          Robin,
           
          I agr=
ee with Steve on a couple of points. First let me say that I
          do b=
elieve that we all have a "technician/guide/guardian" call them what you
  =
        may. but I usually call them by the names they introduced themselve=
s by.
           
          I know for a fact through many, many, many box =
sessions that when I turn
          a box on, could be Frank's box or the m=
inibox or the RS 470 does not matter which.
           
          The same =
two entities will come through immediately, So much so now, that I do not e=
ven ask for conformation that
          it is in fact them. I recognise the=
ir individual voice patterns. I have built a solid relationship with these =
two spirits
          I know as mike and Lisa so much so that I have even g=
otten to know their individual personalities.
           
          There a=
re other newer researchers here that will attest to the fact that when they=
 where doing their first sessions
          I had asked my two "Friends" Mi=
ke and Lisa to assist in getting them started and invariably the spirits th=
at came 
          through to these new researchers during their first sess=
ions identified themselves as Mike and Lisa.
           
          Steve sa=
ys he does not turn on his box and use them as a crutch, that is not entire=
ly true. I had done research 
          very closely with Steve until recen=
tly and I would venture to say that 99% if not every session he starts with=
 "Mike & Lisa
          are you available to talk with me" 
           
   =
       Also I don't consider working with my technicians as using them as a=
 crutch, They would not allow that.
          They are not there like butle=
rs at our beckoned call when we feel they may be of some use.
          Qui=
te the opposite, without them we would get no communication at all, they ar=
e allowing us the honor of receiving this 
          celestial communicatio=
n. They are the moderators, facilitators and generators of all we hear and =
send to and from the spirit realm.
          And they also stand as guards =
and protectors to do the best they can to keep us from being deceived or ta=
ken down a dark path.
           
          Some here wait for others to st=
ate an opinion and then tend to agree with that opinion no matter what they=
 have experienced to be true.
           
          Robin, my advice to you=
 as a new researcher in this field. Form your own beliefs through your expe=
rience and research.
          Listen and learn from others but do not let =
what you believe to be true or not, be swayed by popular opinion.

            I certa=

    Robin,

              If i may add my thoughts on this: There is no con=
crete evidence of 
              who or what comes through is what they say=
 they are. Technicians i 
              have found were used to get you up =
and running and i only now call on 
              them if i need assistance=
. I don't turn the boxes on and ask for 
              them like a crutch, =
i conduct my session and if i need help they will 
              supply it =
to me if needed. I think the whole idea is to find out who 
              w=
e are communicating with, maybe we will never really know for sure 
       =
       but i still try and find out as best as i can.

      disabled allows me a lot more time=
 for research. I am always willing and 
      hopefully able to help new re=
searchers with <BR>my advice and knowledge I 
      have gained through exp=
erience. But my ideology is not the end all 
      explanation or truth of =
box research<BR>all opinions here are valuable and 
      deserving of cons=
ideration and attention.<BR> <BR>As for your 
      question, the fact=
 that I am blessed enough to receive a fairly good level 
      of communic=
ation I believe is based once <BR>again on the relationship I 
      have b=
uilt with my tech/guides and the synchronization of energy we have 
      d=
eveloped.<BR>The level of communication we are at I believe is only the 
  =
    very tip of the iceberg. My goal in "MY" research is to reach a level o=
f 
      communication that <BR>allows us to speak easily and freely with o=
ur 
      spirit friends in a fluid and continual fashion as if having a pl=
easant 
      telephone conversation.<BR> <BR>The gist of the messages=
 I am 
      receiving now are directed toward our spirit counterparts achi=
eving the 
      same goal. It is already a comfort to me to know they are =
there and I have 
      had the opportunity to speak with close family memb=
ers and friends that 
      have crossed over. And also recently Ms. Sarah =
Estep who has made the 
      transition and is beginning to work now on th=
e<BR>spirit side to further 
      the communication. Any information I rec=
eive from the spirits I recognise 
      to be friends is invaluable. Somet=
hing as simple as a yes or no answer to 
      a direct question that has j=
ust been asked is a small miracle in and of 
      itself. considering how =
it was attained and where it is from. Most 
      researchers I think after=
 a certain amount of time succumb to the human 
      flaw of complacency a=
nd take for granted that when they turn a box on they 
      will receive c=
ommunication. They loose site of the fact that this 
      communication is=
 a precious gift to mankind and eventually will change the 
      way we pe=
rceive life and death.<BR> <BR>I don't know if my thinking 
      or o=
pinions are lucid or the rantings of a mad man, I'm sure a lot of 
      pe=
ople would say both. For what it is worth this is how I believe on the
