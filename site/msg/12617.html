I am interested in collecting some o=

building a ghost box based on Frank Sumpti=

from the "Ghost Box Notebook" from 2007, but I a=

getting started. Has anyone built one of these and are=

parts lists or more complete schematics floating around? I would=

appreciate any build help or advice any of you might have.

Regards,
