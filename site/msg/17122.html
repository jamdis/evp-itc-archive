<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I checked out that group link and applied for membership. I hope it&#x27;s not
like it sounds, a guy almost claiming he invented the concept. Even I don&#x27;t
do that, I give originality to Stein, the Danish researcher that was
experimenting with swept radio back in the 80s. I&#x27;ve never been able to
communicate with him, but he&#x27;s mentioned on the German VTF site, get to that
via Stefan Bion&#x27;s EVPmaker links.

&gt; Looks like I&#x27;m going to try this again, maybe with me trying to change the
&gt; wav to mp messed up the Edgar file, so no one heard it looks like, maybe,
&gt; I&#x27;m getting in the way or allowing my gift to interfere, also, it could have
&gt; been subjective.  I&#x27;ll try to get him to speak up, hopefully next time.  It
&gt; was very fuzzy though, tons of static coming in with the voice of a man
&gt; saying that name, even saying mine but, was not clearly defined. Sorry, but
&gt; dat folks, will try this again. sf
