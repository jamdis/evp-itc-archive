<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This is an EVP Maker recording done August 25, 2011 at 4:45 p.m. You have to
play this at about 1.5% of the normal speed to hear it properly. Listed
below is what I think I hear, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I think I&#x27;m right.
It&#x27;s just a guide. Comments are always welcome.

There are some interesting things here about Elenin, perhaps. It sounds
almost like there are to males talking to each other at times. I have a
second part to this audio, which I will post tomorrow.
