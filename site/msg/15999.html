Remember Frank, time on the other side means nothing, you may have a spirit attachment as well if all your getting is a few voices in your recording and they are showing up on the queen marry. There is a few ways of ending the attachment if you have a few.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Is there anybody out there?

  

I don't do alot of regular sessions, when I do a test recording they always start talking imediately, right when the recording starts, on video or just a voice recorder. They always act like they are right there--present. I can't imagine entites just hanging out waiting. 

I think the mini box is just a TRF radio, except it's step tuned in 10khz incrememnts. I don't know why they didn't install a decent amplifier in the thing.
