<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Can anyone shed some light on what seems to be voices, much similar 
to the voices I&#x27;ve recorded during EVP sessionsn with a standard 
digital audio recorder . . .

I have two clients currently, one that has recorded several voices 
that seem to talk over and interrupt voice mail messages sent by his 
ex-girl friend.  The first VME was recorded six years ago.  He 
recently began speaking with her again and is getting the same type 
of phonemena when she leaves a voice mail message.  His phone and 
voice mail service is through SBC Ameritech in MI.  The VME Service 
is of course digital.  The messages sound like breathy echoing  
whispers that say &quot;hey, hey, hiiiiiiiiii&quot;.  The hi is rather long and 
drawn out.

My next client is receiving voice mail messages that are static 
filled and also echo.  The voice messages all say the same thing &quot;You 
know where my mother is, I want to talk to my mother&quot;.  The messages 
come from homes in New Haven MI, and TX.  Regardless of the number 
the message is the same.  Three of the numbers in MI are no longer in 
service, the TX number is apparently a fax number.  The other phone 
numbers come from homes bordering a cemetery located in New Haven 
MI.  My team has spoken with all of the residents.  They do not know 
the client nor does my client know them.

I have been told by one of my tech team members that phone calls can 
be made via internet and there is a way to make it look like the 
calls are coming from a different location.

I welcome any input any of you might have as far as EVP&#x27;s in this 
area!!

Thank-you
