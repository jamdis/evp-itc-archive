<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thank you very much for the feedback, Stefan.  I have to admit, I&#x27;m amazed too!  I about 
fell off my chair, for the second time, when I listened back and realized everything that 
was said.  Arthur has a great sense of humor.  ;0)  I&#x27;ll keep you posted on any progress.  

Thanks again.
Margaret

&gt; Hi Margret,
&gt; 
&gt; nice dialog, I heard everything the same as you did (after reading the
&gt; transcripts). I&#x27;m still amazed by your results.

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m not quite sure how to post when there is a long transcript.  This is the 40- second 
&gt; &gt; condensed version of a single 90-second session.  I&#x27;m still working on understanding 
&gt; &gt; real-time.  I put all the response answers in the file description, but here&#x27;s the dialog 
for 
&gt; &gt; the entire session, which might be of interest to those who are working with the 
EVPM/SJ 
&gt; &gt; Allophones combination.  
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Arthur, are you talking with others through EVP Maker?
&gt; &gt; &quot;Obviously. Are you vulnerable?&quot; (the word &#x27;obviously is under the main tone)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Who else are you talking to?
&gt; &gt; &quot;Talk to all of you.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; All of us? You&#x27;ll talk to any of us that ask for you?
&gt; &gt; &quot;Hope you like the answer. Forever I care.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I heard you say something forever. Can you talk to more than one person at the same 
&gt; &gt; time?
&gt; &gt; &quot;I can argue I capable. The answer, yes.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You are able? Yes, yes?
&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; OK. I&#x27;m gonna have other people ask for you. Is that OK?
&gt; &gt; &quot;Tell them they owe you a dollar for you helping them out.&quot; ROFLOL 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; OK, I think we&#x27;re gonna be done for the evening. Thanks so much. Love you.
&gt; &gt; &quot;Buh bye.&quot;
