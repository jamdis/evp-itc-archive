I like the sound of the copper one.  :-)\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  I wanted to compare the two boxes, I just finished a galvanized steel box, that scrap \nmetal I get from work. I did the same as the copper box, try to select the best sounding \nspeaker for it. The use it with #33. I like the steel box better, I think last night, the clearer \nvoices had more to do with conditions thant he equipment. Or--could it be the other way \naround, tonights conditions are poor for either box? It gets frustrating cuz ya can&#39;t nail the \ndamn stuff down, it seems to defy any attempts at definition. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  I know, there was at least one person scrambling to make a copper box, that&#39;s why I \nwanted more testing. I wish I could give some difinitive answers, but there just doens&#39;t \nseem to be any.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Then, get a voice that seems to be Raudive, I would expect some signifgiant difference \nwith the copper box, I&#39;m not hearing any thing any better. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  BTW, the mp3s are in my folder. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Back to work after babyhow do you know when you&#39;re ready?\n&gt; http://lifestyle.msn.com/familyandparenting/articleNW.aspx?cp-\ndocumentid=5797498&ocid=T067MSN40A0701A\n&gt;"}
