&gt; Hi, my name is Al, and I&#x27;m new to this list. I&#x27;m 57, early-retired due to a
&gt; disability, and have far more free time than I want or know what to do with.
&gt; Which is what got me in trouble recently. After watching &quot;White Noise&quot;
&gt; awhile back, one day I turned on a recorder and turned a radio tuner while
&gt; asking if &quot;anyone&quot; would like to talk. To my great surprise, I found voices
&gt; immediately after uploading and playing the file. I know about evps from
&gt; watching the Ghost Hunters, but these voices were talking to me in a
&gt; conversational tone and about stuff relational to questions I asked and to
&gt; stuff I was doing at the time! This progressed over time into a running
&gt; &quot;conversation&quot; with apparently living beings who are invisible but somehow
&gt; sharing this house! Can someone here please relieve my anxiety a bit? I&#x27;m
&gt; wondering if I&#x27;m messing with something that I shouldn&#x27;t be messing with.
&gt; What are the consequences of this -- and can anyone enlighten me about the
&gt; rules or protocol for dealing with these invisible people? And, has anyone
&gt; found there is NO WAY to talk about this without sounding crazy??
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Al
