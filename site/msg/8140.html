<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rhonda... Thanks so much for watching!  Meredith (Maury&#x27;s PA) was 
great to work with .. and honestly .. she didn&#x27;t freak out as much as 
I did!  There was a lot going on including a member of my Team got 
wacked in the leg ... We have lots more video, evp&#x27;s and pictures to 
post on my site .. It was just plain creepy!  Chris filmed that 
apparition as soon as we walked in the door so I knew we were in for 
a terrifying night...

Debbie

&gt; Hey Debbie,
&gt;    
&gt;   Great clip thanks for sharing that.  Got some good EVPs there and 
the image on tv was  good too. 
&gt;    
&gt;   But I gotta ask ya....did that Meredith gal bug ya with, what 
seemed like, constant freaking out? Maybe its just the way they 
edited the show, but she seemed to freak out over everything.  Was it 
really as often as they showed it to be or was it more of their 
creative editing handywork?
