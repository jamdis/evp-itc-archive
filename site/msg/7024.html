A couple voices from just now testign another car tuner. I have veryu  few of

almost like regular EVP. Rigel is one that comes through every once in  
awhile, not sure if that his name, or home, as sometimes he says "this is your  
friend from Rigel"

It's still looking like the sound  chamber is completely un needed, and may 
even hamper the voices. What I get  form the Ghostman, and even directly from a 
tuenr module is easier to  understand that the ones through an sound chamber 
and mic amplifiers. the  Gostman in direct mode yields longs, and more 
coherent voices than the  original box, at least compared to what I was getting last 
night.
Tonight  I'll modifiy #32 to get either direct recordings out of  the tuner, 
or through the sound chamber so I can compare.  I had one from 2/5/08 from the 
Ghostman that said "that Earthquake will  occur-------I had one from 2/5 
Chile (Falklands?)C  There  was a EQ today off Brazil, but no island there.

DRV=direct  radio voice

Frank-S
