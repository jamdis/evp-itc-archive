Nuff said :-)

Believe what you want. I won&#x27;t waste my time on him. Hope you don&#x27;t waste
yours.

I read and listen to just about everything on this group. I rarely comment.

There&#x27;s a reason. But if you can vouch for RJ and know who he really is,
then more power to you.

However, if you don&#x27;t ..... Please don&#x27;t be naive.

That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got to say on the subject.

&gt; Hey now. If I may, RJ was not being  a troll, IMO. He was just stating his
&gt; observation. He should be allowed. You can take it or leave it.

&gt; RJ ... I&#x27;m not throwing a fit at all. I&#x27;m just pointing out a Troll when I
&gt; see one and you my friend are a TROLL.
&gt;
&gt; No problem at all.  I mean it in the nicest way possible. I hope they will
&gt; throw you out ASAP as all the other forums have.
&gt;
&gt; Have a great day. I can&#x27;t let you get away with implying Frank is a liar
&gt; and he must do as you say! It&#x27;s just hilarious!!!!

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And who the hell here is so perfect and so knowlegdable that they know
&gt;&gt; what questions to ask and what answers are valid?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This communcation mode is extremely experimental, nothing is known about
&gt;&gt; it, or who uses it on the oter side. All there is is abunch of wanna be and
&gt;&gt; self proclaimed experts that base everything they know on Ghost Busters and

&gt;&gt; &gt; If you like to post some (future) predictions for this year with clear

&gt;&gt; to better interact with their voices and acquire clearer more understandable

&gt;&gt; am &quot;wrong&quot; that the world did not end on August 15 as was predicted, please
&gt;&gt; do so. But throwing a little tantrum with no constructive criticism doesn&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; really allow much productive conversation, if I may say so.

&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Twisting a prediction after the fact to fit circumstances is one of the
&gt;&gt; biggest mistakes (or biggest cop-outs, or biggest lies) a would-be
&gt;&gt; future-teller makes.  The predictions you were touting were for August 15,
&gt;&gt; and included end-of-the-world warning..  Trying to say these were correct,
&gt;&gt; but not REALLY for August 15, and not REALLY end-of-the-world stuff, seems
&gt;&gt; like a way to save face, or keep hoping the messages are real, when in fact,
&gt;&gt; this is another example that they are not.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; So from now on, you will no longer hear clear dates and predictions.
&gt;&gt; You may hear vague dates and vague predictions if you like, but you will not
&gt;&gt; hear anything that can be confirmed.  Doing so would put you in a position
&gt;&gt; of having to question the verity of the EVP data you collect.  And that
&gt;&gt; might lead to abandoning this while area of study.  And we
&gt;&gt; &gt; know you cannot do that.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  Well, it seems the original prediction of the east coast getting
&gt;&gt; clobbered is probably correct. Where I fell down was trying to ask questions
&gt;&gt; and getting BS doomsville junk. I knew it&#x27;s a mistake to ask questions, that
&gt;&gt; like opens the door for the dark dorks. I&#x27;m going back to just announcing
&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m doing an EVP recording, and just record. They know what I&#x27;m thinking and
&gt;&gt; what I need to know and who I would like to hear from. Asking questions, at
&gt;&gt; least for me, has always lead to problems. I&#x27;m not like others, presumming
&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m so smart and know what is talking, and if it&#x27;s honest, like most of the
&gt;&gt; box experts out there on the web. You know, the ones doing pod casts, radio
&gt;&gt; shows and proclaiming this that and the other thing.
