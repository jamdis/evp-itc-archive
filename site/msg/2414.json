Very frustrating!! So EVP is useful only to the \nexperiencer, I guess. Yet another reason why I hesitate to make more \nboxes, there&#39;s no way to determine if it works, or is it just \nimagination/perception. Ya get just enough to string you along! \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; I don&#39;t agree with that Frank I don&#39;t believe they give just enough \nto string us along, I believe we are understanding just enough so \nthat they keep trying.\n\nI think we advance a little each time we initiate any form of \ncommunication with the other side. It&#39;s like a baby you have to crawl \nbefore you can walk, walk before you can run. I think that they set \nthe pace for advancing not us and are giving us what we need a little \nat a time to go from crawling to walking at this point. \n\nFrom some of my messages I believe the ones that no one but us can \nhear are the most important of all, because I know when I record a \nmessage that is clear to me and no one else can hear it, it makes me \ngo back and reexamine the message and helps me sometimes to better \nunderstand it.\n\nI know that you know what I&#39;m talking about because you have been to \nthe promise land and returned with the gift of knowledge.\n\nBruce\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Peek-a-boo FREE Tricks & Treats for You!\n&gt; http://www.reallivemoms.com?ocid=TXT_TAGHM&loc=us\n&gt;"}
