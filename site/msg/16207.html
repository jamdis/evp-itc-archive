In the scientific world everything related to evp is considered sketchy compared to other means of evidence.  The only way to validate that an evp is from a relative or loved one is to have them answer a question only known by them.  Demons are known to fake things like this just to get your attention or to cause havoc. As far as the evp is concerned in this particular chat it wont be pushed to scientific values rather to an emotional value to the person that revived the message.  There is nothing wrong with that but in the same token, it is sciences job to debunk the claim by some sort of scientific measure. NONE OF THIS HAS HAPPENED IN THIS POST.  So before getting on someones case about and evp and drilling them into the ground on what you consider scientific remember this,  your evidence MUST go through the same process that you push this current evp into.  Is yours or anyone else's evp 100% true?  Who knows, we sure don't.

That's fine, but I think your missing my 
point. My point is that this is not evidence as far as science is concerned. 
That doesn't mean that your wrong, it just means that it doesn't constitute any 
kind of proof in the scientific world.

  Well, I would disagree with the idea I'm hearing what I want to hear. The 
  first time I got my dad's friend Gordy, I didn't even hear his name; I thought 
  he was saying "Forty, forty, forty." It was only in a later session that he 
  identified himself again using his full proper name. Then I realized that he 
  is now dead (last I saw him he was very much alive), and that he'd been saying

  what is being heard, the themes often seem to reflect what may be subconscious 
  concerns of the operator or the listener. If external sources additionally 
  inform this process of perception, it is quite possible they influence both 
  what is recorded and how is later perceived. This would also nicely explain 
  why some people hear the same things on a recording while others hear quite 
  different things and more importantly while one person hears different things 
  from the same recording at different times.<br>> > > > <br>>

  would modify the physical world. On the other hand, we have good evidence 
  demonstrating the ability of living individuals to alter their environments in 
  profound ways, apparently with their minds. So it seems to make more sense 
  that this might indeed by the underlying mechanism to EVPs rather than 
  discarnate manipulations.<br>> > > > <br>> > > > ---

  born until decades later, I never knew him, but I do understand that people 
  come through we did not know in life. Has anyone else contacted someone
