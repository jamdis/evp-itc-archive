<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I saw palmetto bugs in Florida that were the size of mice.  I thought to 
myself, &quot;That&#x27;s just great. Flying cockroaches as big as mice!&quot;

I&#x27;ve heard that in equatorial climates they get even bigger.  I heard of 
fireflies in Sumatra that were a foot long. At least they are harmless!

&gt; OMG when I was in Cabo San Lucas the cockroachs were the size of rats! and there were several spider/bug things I have no idea what they were. I made sure I checked between the sheets before I crawled into bed everynight.

&gt;                  Ah, a subject I can comment on with authority... killing ants and things that sting is my specialty here in Mexico...you&#x27;ll love the simple answer...laundry detergent.  I can tell you stories of tiny crazy ants to ants as large as half your thumb...tried all kinds of things like chlorine...acid...but a hand full of cheap, cheap, blue laundry detergent mixed in water will kill ants on the spot...dead, done, gone, ready for an EVP session.  What a blessing since I am highly allergic to all pesticides.  Getting ants out of an electrical system is another matter.  I have them running along by house electrical lines and must wait for them to show their face before I soap em.    Ron L

&gt;      Awe, yes...the crazy raspberry ants. How in the heck does one stop
&gt; them without a natural predator to eat the begeezus out of &#x27;em? They
&gt; are ungodly, like a plague sent right from Moses! ;)
