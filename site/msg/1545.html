<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Since, I&#x27;m one of those people ;)... You know I like to tease. If and  
when I can get one, I will be delighted. If you need me to cover  
costs, let me know. All of that is not an issue, whenever the time is  
right.

I do think you ought to ask Them who the box belongs to, tho. They  
said it was supposed to be a gift. Maybe they have plans for it already.

Your friend,

Ann

&gt; There&#x27;s enough people wanting boxes that who to give them to  
&gt; without dissing
&gt; anyone is a problem. These are the same as all the others I&#x27;ve  
&gt; given away.
&gt; They were made as proto types to test ideas, mostly different ways of
&gt; construction, after they are built, I always want to move on tho other
&gt; ideas.
