<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You don&#x27;t, William, and you never will, now matter how many  
safeguards and other measures are put in place.

As hard as it may be to understand now, less than a year ago this was  
a small, quiet list of researchers who knew each other or each  
other&#x27;s reputation well enough to know we were all after the same  
thing. Now this place is grand central station and no one knows each  
other and the people here have *widely* varying agendas. The ones who  
think we need to regulate everything with a mind to providing proof  
to the public and skeptics may well out-number those of us who no  
longer care about winning other hearts and minds other than our own.  
I dunno. But recognition of both mindsets will have to be in place or  
all it will do is spawn more flame wars.

&gt; I don&#x27;t think anyone would wait 30 seconds after a question and
&gt; associate a word or phrase to be the answer to that question.
&gt;
&gt; Also in a thirty second period if the researcher has not asked  
&gt; another question and moved on
&gt; someone should try and help them with how they are doing a session.
&gt;
&gt; You Know I clip all the useless fragment crap out of my files, are  
&gt; you trying to say you hold your research to a higher
&gt; degree than I do?
&gt;
&gt; And because the crap sounds are cut from a file does not make it  
&gt; pieced together.
&gt; If a researcher is taking words from different parts of a recording  
&gt; and putting them together to make a sentence
&gt; that would be piecing them together, that would be an out and out  
&gt; fake.
&gt;
&gt; As long as the researcher has the original clip to present upon

&gt; questions of the files validity.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; Here’s my take…or 2 cents worth..:-)
&gt;
&gt; Share your files all clipped without the garbage for others to  
&gt; listen to. Save your original files for further development and  
&gt; records, in the case a scientific organization wants to “hear”  
&gt; the original along with the clipped, walahh you have both. And  
&gt; everyone is Happy!

&gt; Bruce    To add to what you said, the capacity of the yahoo forum  
&gt; we are with does not permit long recordings and the messages we  
&gt; have been receiving seem to be getting longer and longer each  
&gt; passing month.  Not much room for the &quot;gargage.&quot;  I for one prefer  
&gt; to hear the important message words, knowing full well the author  
&gt; edited the file.  If someone wants to present false stuff so that  
&gt; he or she gets false praise from us,  god bless them if they need  
&gt; the praise.  For scientific research with original files...that&#x27; s  
&gt; another story.  Ron L

&gt; Stefan,

&gt; I do remove the &quot;garbage&quot; from my files.
&gt;
&gt; At this point in my research, the message is more important to me  
&gt; than the proof of it.
&gt; I think most of us here will agree that we are receiving some sort  
&gt; of paranormal communication.
&gt; but it definitely exists. now we need to concentrate on the  
&gt; messages they need us to hear and the answers to the questions
&gt; we ask and in turn our answers to their questions. Anyone that  
&gt; cleans a file in this way should not be touching any bit of the file
&gt; that has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously  
&gt; garbage like the &quot;EH O EH AH O EH UR&quot; in between words.
&gt;
&gt; For example &quot;Is there anyone here that wishes to communicate_  
&gt; YES_AH ER EEH AR OOO AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE&quot;
&gt; It is much easier for me as a researcher to be able to return to a  
&gt; file that I recieved two weeks ago and that I believe may hold some
&gt; relivence to a message I just received and be able to cleanly  
&gt; listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage sounds.
&gt;
&gt; At this stage in real time communication the messages are the top  
&gt; priority.
&gt; I do however agree that the untouched version should be retained  
&gt; and made available to individuals that make a request
&gt; for any intelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that may be  
&gt; made, and god knows there are always fanatical
&gt; sceptics lurking in the shadows awaiting an opportunity to attack  
&gt; an unwary or injured researcher. I do not think that
&gt; our research files should be made available on request by every tom  
&gt; dick and harry that is unknown to us and may potentially
&gt; doctor the file to suit their own point and post it as such.
&gt;
&gt; I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the  
&gt; researcher that receives the request for raw research data should
&gt; scrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment before  
&gt; handing out any research data.
&gt;
&gt; These are my thoughts on the subject of cleaning a file.

&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Editing EVP
&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I would
&gt; suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, in
&gt; order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can for
&gt; instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (including
&gt; the experimenter&#x27; s voice), filter or denoise it to make it  
&gt; clearer, but
&gt; not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP  
&gt; match
&gt; with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should always
&gt; be provided along with the edited version.
&gt;
&gt; But that&#x27;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to  
&gt; express, as
&gt; we should always be able to present our results to a critical public.
&gt;
&gt; Stefan
&gt;
&gt; -- 
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these files.
&gt; &gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that
&gt; &gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the message
&gt; &gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise that
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can&#x27;t piece these
&gt; &gt; files together to make something it&#x27;s not, so i keep them in true
&gt; &gt; form pretty much to the original.
