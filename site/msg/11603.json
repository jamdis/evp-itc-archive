I can&#39;t make it on Saturday, since I have to \nwork, but I&#39;m thinking about going on Sunday. If you go to the site \nit has a live feed (which I plan to watch at work)and its venue, \netc. There&#39;s going to be all kinds of different stuff, but I don&#39;t \nknow if it&#39;s worth the money. I think it&#39;d be interesting to go \nthough.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; -Aaron\n&gt;"}
