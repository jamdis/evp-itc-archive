Ralph,
 
I am glad you took what Is said as constructive and not just crit=
icism for it's own sake.
The attitude you adopt about learning and being hu=
ngry for knowledge is a very mature and healthy one.
It is attitudes and ou=
t looks like that that will advance this research.
 
To answer your questio=
n about individual sweep rates. The more sophisticated boxes like Frank's b=
ox,
the minibox and Joe's box have sweep rate adjustment knobs. The RS boxe=
s being mass manufactured 
portable radios not meant for the purpose of con=
tinuously sweeping the dial have a set sweep rate.
 
The inventor or discov=
erer of the RS hack, Sum Duc had developed a chip that could be added t0o t=
he RS box to control the
sweep speed but he only made a few available to so=
me of the more advanced researchers and then dropped out of sight for perso=
nal reasons.
 
The sweep rate of any given box is subject to tuning on each=
 individual session and is usually done on the fly so to speak during the s=
ession
to accommodate the ever changing signal.
With the RS box that is not=
 possible, but it seems to be at a rate that works in almost all situations=
. so that I consider a gift.
 
We all have to work with what we have and ma=
ke the best of it until the brainy people in this field come up with the ne=
xt breakthrough which I have no doubt they will.

Hi Bruce H. and ever=
yone,Thanks again for the comments on my files I appreciate them. Bruce tha=
nks for the criticism and advice on doing them better. I do tend to over ki=
ll my files with alot of noise reduction and filtering. The reason they don=
't sound like RS box files is that I weed out just the voice I hear without=
 all of the background clutter. Most of the time. Another thing is that my =
hearing is acute in the low frequency range. I have hearing loss in the hig=
h upper frequencies. That's why I can hear what others tend not to hear. Al=
so I find that when you listen to these with different types of speaker sys=
tems and different formats like MP3's and Wav files and Aiff files and Ogg =
files they sound completely different. I have also found that using differe=
nt headphones can effect the sounds too in the way you hear them. Bruce som=
e of your files I hear something all together different then what you say t=
hey said ,but that could be my hearing is different than yours and my sound=
 system may be different than yours. I'm not sure. That's why it's a diffic=
ult thing to interpret these sound files sometimes. You have some I can rea=
lly hear what you said they were saying and others not. Your right in the f=
act that I do tend to take too much away from the file with noice reduction=
 and I'll have to cut back on that ,and to copy more of the background nois=
e so everyone knows it's from the RS 12-469 model. Bruce I appreciate your =
advice alot. keep me informed on anything I'm doing wrong with these boxes =
since I am new to this and you pretty much know more about them than I do. =
Since I have mostly worked with Tradional EVP's and this is a completely di=
fferent kind of venue to work with and research I hope you all will help me=
 out and point me in the right direction. The thing is I hear these files a=
s clear as anything. Maybe I'm just matrixing what I hear on the boxes I do=
n't know. All I know is that what I have on here all came from the RS 12-46=
9 Box and I have alot to learn from the group on recording them and so fort=
h. I want to thank everyone with their comments and for their help in this =
research here with EVP-ITC it's very interesting to say the least. I hope y=
ou all are doing okay and I hope that my files get better and more understa=
ndable as I do my research in this study with all of you. Thanks again !!!!=
!Regards,Ralph the Ghost HunterI forgot I wanted to ask you Bruce and anyon=
e else on here what is the Scan rate on your boxes ? On my RS 12-469 it's 1=
7 seconds to make a complete linear scan. On the RS 12-470 it's 11 seconds.=
 On the RS 20-125 it's 11 seconds too. What should the Scan rate be ? Just =
wondering if other people have different scan rates than mine. Does that ma=
ke a diffence in getting better quality voices ? Thanks.
