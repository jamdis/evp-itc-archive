There  \nare a lot of radio stations in this area (Baltimore-Washington) and I  \njust could not get a tuning that gave me any confidence that what I  \nheard wasn&#39;t broadcast fragments--and really, nothing came through  \nthat made me even wonder if.... Anyway, I went  bed last night  \nthinking that I&#39;m going to prove the exception to the rule and this  \nwon&#39;t work for me, but I&#39;m gonna give it a go again today.\n\nAny of you tech guys around today if I need some help with setting  \nand other tech issues?\n\nAnn"}
