Just when you think you&#39;re getting great  \n&gt; evidiecne and proo, it turns out to be these tricky jokers. Another  \n&gt; reason not to take everything a gospel truth.  I think it was  \n&gt; thoise researchers in Luxemberg(?) that first got these guys, but I  \n&gt; don&#39;t remeber for sure. So if you hear any reference to fish,  \n&gt; that&#39;s a clue that they are there. I am uncertain if they are bad  \n&gt; guys, or just tricksters.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; See what people are saying about Windows Live. Check out featured  \n&gt; posts.
