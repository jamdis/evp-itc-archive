It helps to use as clear as possible speech, even so, the output \ncan be kinda distorted, as the raw audio is chopped up, and played back \nrandomly. I save the session and export the aduio to the same folder as \nthe session. I use an audio program to copy, and past out the phrases \nand messages. I don&#39;t use any filtering, but sometime will slow down \nthe playback to make it easier. Sometimes the voices can be \nmulitlayered, which is confusing to listen to. Mostly, just follow the \ninstructions! There is a manual that has to be downloaded seperately.\n\n Frank-S\n\n --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am getting nowhere with my RS hack here in Mexico. I still need to \nsend a recorded session to Bruce to double check because I may not be \nhearing certain things and I would like a verification of the signal \nquality I am receiving.  HST I do have EVP maker and I am now \nencouraged by what Frank S is saying.  Any tips on how to do a session \nwith this program?
