Frank This came after I emailed you so perhaps its a notation to add to what I said about thier words sometimes get edited or have more meaning later on. The message is improved in time. I am still not sure who used to be proud of me because I forgot to ask for names and later sessions were not as clear.
   
  The signals were very strong today here. I did a session using the pc fm radio set to the station "they" requested using no antenna hookup and then ran it thru the filter "they" made me stumble upon...the conversation was so loud in some parts it kinda freaked me out a little bit at first LOL 
   
  I dont usually use that method alot because it never has good results unless I mute it while recording even then it only increases thier signal a bit louder which I can do using amplify or turn the volume up.
   
  It's stormy here the past few days so perhaps that is a factor.
