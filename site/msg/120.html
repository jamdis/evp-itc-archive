I hear that exactly as you do. That made me dig out one of mine. They were talking about art but when I was listening i heard "its oliver (all over) misty come closer to art work of art" and in my mind I was thinking art/painting/craft aka images not art bell LOL so had to dig it out to see if thats still what i hear thru the fuzz.
   
  The image group and the regular evp group communicate in different ways so I still think they meant images, however they have been trying to get me to move out of this neighborhood but I am not moving closer to art bell. Have a friend from there and the food is a little too strange for me LOL.

              Hi All;
   I found this on the second listening of the June 5th tape, I don�t know how I missed the first time through. This is the stuff that confuses me to no end, I get all this bogus prophecy crap, as if something wants to discredit the boxes, then I get this kind of voice. I did put this on my site.  http://franksumption.tripod.com/id144.html
