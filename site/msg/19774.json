A woman was speaking it during the clip starting\n&gt; &gt; at .41 seconds.  Are there any French radio stations down that way?  What I\n&gt; &gt; find interesting is that she is speaking French and man is agreeing with her\n&gt; &gt; in English.  It may be radio broadcast because of the clarity, but I would\n&gt; &gt; think a translator would be speaking for her since only the Bayou and Quebec\n&gt; &gt; use French here in North America.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My French is really rusty, but I think she is saying:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;D&#39;accord.  En vous etait parlons a l&#39;etre (yes)  te t&#39;aller....&quot; and I\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t quite make out the rest.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I agree.  What you are talking about is the being (yes).  You go....&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When you switch to direct mode random at 4:13 you get a pretty clear female\n&gt; &gt; &quot;hey.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Looks like the camera was well worth the money!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tim\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Dec 24, 2010 at 12:35 PM, Urkel23 &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This video was shot with my new FLIP MinoHD camera.
