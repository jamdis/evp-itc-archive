Actually, getting the flash as far away from the lens as possible\n&gt; plus either bouncing it off the ceiling or using a diffuser will\n&gt; almost eliminate dust orbs. A speedlite flash is well worth the $$.\n&gt;\n&gt; To make this a little more on topic, I have a 469 radio shack hack\n&gt; unit. I&#39;ve tried it a few times and haven&#39;t received any messages at\n&gt; all yet. I&#39;ve even tried just letting it run for a while while I&#39;m\n&gt; doing other things and haven&#39;t gotten anything. I guess there isn&#39;t\n&gt; anyone around who wants to talk to me :( Do you know of anything I can\n&gt; do to try to drum up some conversation?\n&gt;\n&gt; Elabeth\n&gt;"}
