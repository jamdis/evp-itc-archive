Hello everyone I am a member of Peace of Mind Paranormal Society here in=
 Pittsburgh, PA

We just recently investigated Fort Mifflin. I made a Radio=
-shak hack with directions from UFOgeek's videos. This was our first attepm=
t with it. How or where would i upload the wav file for you guys to take a =
listen.

I am having a hard time getting some of our more skeptical members=
 to buy into the ITC-EVP ghost box stuff. I am convinced with everything i =
seen and read about Frank and all his work to what i saw on Youtube etc...
=

please respond
