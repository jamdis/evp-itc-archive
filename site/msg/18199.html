<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, I for one, hope David is right about Obama leaving office.  Of course, that would mean Joe Biden would be president... sigh.  That isn&#x27;t a happy thought either.

I hope there is not another war.  I just heard somewhere of secret plans to attack Iran.  Lol, if I heard about it, it must not be very secret.

&gt;  Don&#x27;t know what after that, whole thing is scary, he was going to bring back the troops, ya right!  &quot;liar, liar, pants on fire.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; As the Tech, David might say; &quot;oh well,&quot;  sometimes his expression is; &quot;for the last time&quot; or &quot;i really don&#x27;t wanna talk about it.&quot; sf
