Did you slow it\ndown?

Most messages were two or maybe three words, only a couple were longer with any meaning. I&#39;ll post a few here as\n&gt; an example.\n&gt; &quot;Ohh Yes&quot;\n&gt; &quot;You hear the people&quot;\n&gt; &quot;The people use the test, you should tape..error&quot;\n\n&gt; Thanks for the excellent tip, this method appears to have great potential,\n&gt; Dave\n\n&gt; --- yahoogroups@... wrote:\n\n&gt; From: Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt;\n&gt; To: Misty Dawn &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] An idea: random event generator based on alphabet\n&gt; Date: Wed, 26 Mar 2008 02:39:52 +0100\n\n&gt; Hi Misty, &quot;inner energy&quot;, all,\n\n&gt; maybe one could feed the SpeakJet allophones into EVPmaker. The attached\n&gt; WAV file contains the 72 allophones of the SpeakJet chip. (I used\n&gt; Audition to cut them out of the sample clip which has been posted here\n&gt; recently, and store them in a cue list.) To use this file as an EVPmaker\n&gt; source, the &quot;Use Cue List&quot; option must be checked. I have done a few short\n&gt; sessions, and got this strange message:\n\n&gt;                 &quot;I little Sir help you eclipse.&quot;\n\n&gt; (Doesn&#39;t make any sense to me... lol)\n\n&gt; Of course, this cannot replace a hardware version of SpeakJet, since\n&gt; EVPmaker isn&#39;t able to produce the proper transitions between the\n&gt; allophones. But maybe it&#39;s worth a try...\n\n&gt; Stefan"}
