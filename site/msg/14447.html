Wait a minute...I see now why you were talking about "subconscious" as a te=
rm. It was because I said it was the scientific term for the astral. So yes=
, your right, it wasn't a true scientific term. I just meant it was more of=
 a tangible way of explaining it. I guess the true scientific term would be=
 your unconscious mind, or Feud's ID.

Sorry, I had to mull it over a bit L=
OL!

    Science people will tell you there is no astr=
al. The term "Astral" was coined by the first people who experienced this r=
ealm. But all words were coined. Even words such as dog or cat. 

    Also,=
 subconscious means below conscious or not conscious. So it isn't incorrect=
, though maybe some scholarly types will tell you it isn't proper. Again, a=
ll words were coined.

    You have to remember that colleges and schools a=
re mostly made up by people, people who think only scientifically. I know-n=
ot all people in colleges think this way, but that is what learning institu=
tions are based on. They reject any term they can't grasp or understand und=
er a microscope.

    All this is besides the point though.
