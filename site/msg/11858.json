This seems to be an entity collective who enjoy teasing EVP researchers. They caused a lot of annoyance to other researchers in the past, but nothing serious. Some seemed to be afraid of them, but I never really heard of them doing anymore than being annoying and prankish and sometimes, well, actually pretty damned funny on occasion.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      __________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Looking for the perfect gift?
