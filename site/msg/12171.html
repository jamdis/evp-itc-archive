<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Everyone,

I&#x27;ve purchased both the Puck and the Ovilus earlier this year and 
while I&#x27;m still experimenting with both, I thought I&#x27;d weigh in with 
my thoughts.

Concerning Ron&#x27;s issues, below, re the Ovilus:

1.  I&#x27;ve had no problem with the 9V battery draining quickly when 
using the Ovilus.  I&#x27;ve used it for over 12 hours already and the 
battery still has about 50 percent charge left.

2.  Ron, I noticed that if I pushed the mode selection button down 
too quickly, it does not change mode.  However, I discovered that if 
I pushed and released the button slowly, the mode selection worked 
fine.  Perhaps you&#x27;re pushing the button too fast?

3.  Dictionary mode only repeated words specific to the location; 
e.g., I had the Ovilus on the battlefields in Gettysburg and it kept 
repeating &quot;crouch, hide, fierce, energy, remember, forgive&quot;; whereas 
on a private investigation at an adult toy store in SF, it kept 
repeating &quot;erotic&quot;.  

4.  Both Phoneme and Mix modes worked fine off available energy.  
Again, the locale/environment is key in that both the Ovilus and the 
Puck take readings from the environment (EMF, temperature, etc.) and 
translate those readings into words.

5.  I have not had a chance to do any significant experimentation 
with the other modes (Yes/No, EMG, Level Mode and Dowsing Mode) so 
can&#x27;t remark on those.

The only issue I have with the Ovilus is that at times it&#x27;s 
difficult to make out what the robotic voice is saying as it 
distorts a bit on certain words and/or speaks them drawn out 
like &quot;Lis--ten&quot; for Listen.

In regards to the Paranormal Puck, I&#x27;m totally in love with it in 
that one can set alarms/thresholds that when reached, will either 
record a video or photo (with your webcam) or audio of whatever&#x27;s in 
the immediate environment.  Therefore, one doesn&#x27;t even have to be 
present when the EMF rises to say, over 2 MG, or the temperature 
drops more than 10 degrees.  The webcam will document whatever&#x27;s in 
the environment at that time.  The Puck&#x27;s Excel data sheet logs all 
changes in the environmental -- excellent source of reference!

&gt; From one user, here are a few things I have issues with.  
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Unit only works off a 9 volt battery...no ac or other dc 
options possible.  My battery goes down fast and they are not cheap 
and I know of no way to recharge this type of battery.  Also, the 
battery seems to drain even when not used (I mentioned this to Bill).
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Mode selection at times does not change the mode when button 
is pressed.  I often have to push the mode select many times to get 
it to move to the next mode.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  Dictonary mode seems to not offer anything but repeat words.  
Have not checked this very closely yet but I hear repeating words 
and names...especially... Larry...often.  I have no confidence in 
this mode.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.  The phonemes and mix mode seem very limited in that I often do 
not get any &quot;energy&quot; reading to allow sounds to be emitted. Although 
I try to conduct my sessions in a calm mode myself, apparently I 
don&#x27;t have enough energy around me to get a consistant energy 
reading. 
&gt; 
&gt; 5.  Never tested other modes to determine value or usefulness 
except for the yes/no and I found this to be totally out of touch.  
Somethng like McCain...sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; I do intend to work with the concepts Jeff put forth...but first I 
need to go buy more batteries.  Also, I will dig out a clip I have 
from one of my sessions and post it hear.  Maybe you can help me 
with translation.  Ron
