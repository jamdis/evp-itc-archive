&gt; I think someone that stands to loose there bread and butter is making 
&gt; idle threats or having someone else do it. I would like to state for 
&gt; the record. SEND ME SOME DEATH THREATS YOU COWARD OR BETTER YET LETS 
&gt; SET UP A MEETING AND WE WILL SEE WHO IS LEFT FACE DOWN. 
&gt; 
&gt; Who ever you are you better hope I never find out, it&#x27;s a bitch when 
&gt; the hunter becomes the hunted!
&gt; 
&gt; If you got the balls contact me!

&gt; Sum don&#x27;t worry anyone that talks about doing something does only that 
&gt; TALK!
