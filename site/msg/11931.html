<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I disagree. If a voice is coming through the vent in my car saying  
&quot;WISTERIA!!!...WISTERIA!!!! WE MUST TALK TO YOU!!! NOW!!! WISTERIA!!!  
WE KNOW YOU CAN HEAR US!!!&quot; etc... and 3 people in my car hear the  
same exact thing loud and clear, are you going to tell them that isn&#x27;t  
as real as a movie?

I don&#x27;t think so.

I&#x27;d agree that some forms of EVP/ITC might be up for debate, but  
certainly many recordings which have been analyzed by experts in the  
audio field and found to be real, yet unexplainable, prove EVP is real.

We are recording something. What or who it is, we don&#x27;t know.
