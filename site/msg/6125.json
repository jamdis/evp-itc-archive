Coincidentally, I am outside in a light rain so maybe it is \nideal for me here in Mexico where I get few signals.\n\nAt first I thought I heard the word BUENO (hello in Spanish) but I now \nhear DINO with is my wife&#39;s name...short for Dinorah.  She is normally \nnot with me for sessions and was not with me for this session so I \ndoubt what I am hearing.  Any comments would be appreciated.  \n\nThe other recording I hear the name HELEN.  I don&#39;t know anyone with \nthat name.  Ron L"}
