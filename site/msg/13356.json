His family had that version\n&gt; of the biography recalled and reissued it without the last chapter.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway in this last chapter, Edison alludes to a way to communicate with\n&gt; the dead but he never says he did it.  He simply hypothesizes on how it\n&gt; could be done and the fact that the dead are just on a different wavelength\n&gt; than the living.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry, no links...  This is from that old fashioned thing called a book :))\n&gt;\n&gt; I can tell you how to find your own copy though if you wish.  I need to\n&gt; find the actual page count from my copy but I went to amazon&#39;s used books\n&gt; and asked every seller how many pages their copy was.  The first one to\n&gt; respond with the correct (bigger) number, that was the one I bought.\n&gt;\n&gt; Don\n&gt;\n&gt; PS but don&#39;t spend alot.

Modern researchers in this field will\n&gt; have to stand on their own results anyway, and if they&#39;ve managed to\n&gt; discover something that Edison never achieved, good for them!\n&gt;\n&gt; I have also heard varied claims: that Edison did make this box; that\n&gt; Edison was working on it but never finished it; that Edison was joking\n&gt; when he mentioned working on it. So for my own sake, I&#39;d like to know\n&gt; the real story.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you have a link to where you got your information from his\n&gt; assistants and staff, I would really like to read it. Please make\n&gt; sure it is as close to the source material as possible, and not\n&gt; someone quoting someone quoting an article. For example, here is a\n&gt; link to the actual New York times article on Edison discussing his\n&gt; views of life after death:\n&gt; http://query. nytimes.com/ mem/archive- free/pdf? _r=1&res=\n&gt; 9903EEDC1F39E333 A25751C0A9669D94 6196D6CF&lt;http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9903EEDC1F39E333A25751C0A9669D946196D6CF&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; That is the kind of link I&#39;d be hoping for regarding your statements.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for any info.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rj\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, &quot;threadsintyme@ ...&quot;\n&gt; &lt;Threadsintyme@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When Moon starts to walk on water, change water to whine, heals the\n&gt; sick and and lame and balances our national budget is when I will\n&gt; believe this type of hype!!\n&gt; &gt; &quot;John is joined in his mission by Chris Moon, an expert in all\n&gt; things paranormal and possessor of Thomas Edison&#39;s mysterious\n&gt; `telephone to the dead&#39;&quot;\n&gt; &gt; The only problem with this hype is that there is no and probably was\n&gt; never a telephone to the dead.
