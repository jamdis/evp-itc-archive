What I would like them to explain is how the messages \nrecieved in this manner pertain to my individual life , family and \nname and how can anyone explain what is so far to my knowledge \nunexplainable. Anyway enough venting. This began as a good hearted \npost on another paranormal forum in hopes of spurring some \nresearchers like myself that were unaware of these methods to maybe \ngive them a try. I was immediatly attacked like by a pack of wolves \nclaiming to be so called electronic experts and self appointed \ndebunkers of fraud when all I did was to explain my experience with \nthe method and not to give a fact based report on it&#39;s validity but \nto give my personal experience with it. WHY CAN&#39;T WE ALL JUST GET \nALONG !!!\n\nbruce"}
