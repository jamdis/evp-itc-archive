Thank you Ann. I think that was actually very gentle. 

Victoria, I recommend you seek out and contact Bruce Moen. He has made it his mission to perform spirit rescues. That may be more up your alley.

Regards,

Frank R.

Victoria,


Frank has no more idea how to "save" the legions of restless dead than the rest of us. We're trying to establish a clear two-way communication with those entities in other realms of life than our own. What you use the radio-sweep technology for is your choice, but because of the infancy of this research, it is best, in my opinion, to approach it without an agenda or preconceived notions.


I've also got to say that this may not be the area of research you want to commit to. You say you haven't slept well since the 1970s and that the Dead bother you. You don't sound like you have managed to develop a way of dealing with them that leads to less stress on you. This is very likely going to add to the stress, not relieve it.


There is inherent beauty in this research, but never come to it thinking that it is a panacea for either you or the "dead screaming for help." The reality is is that it's a hard, long slog for a few short messages. It's hours of sessions and reviews--a lot of which is very tiring, for reasons that may be natural and "supernatural. "


Frank can't "do the world a favor." He's not hiding any big secret to life, the universe, and everything. No one here is. And anyone who claims otherwise is fooling both you and themselves.


Hard truths, but they need to be said.


Ann

Well,
If you actually have something... it is wrong for you to hide it...
I haven't slept well since the 1970"s...
There are crimes to be solved...the dead are screaming for help...
Sometimes, all forensics needs is a direction...
Frank...if this is actually your name...jeese. ..do the world a favor...do the right thing and show us how to help them...if we help the dead...we help thousands of the living.
But understand what you do...the religious right will hate you.
It goes against everything "they" say about the human soul.
