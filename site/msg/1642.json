For years I have experienced a wave of=\r\n nausea around a variety of energy feilds. I felt light headed and nausea a=\r\nround Bill&#39;s box. Now this might be silly and/or psychosymatic but when I l=\r\nisten to the files posted (from my comp) on this site, of the box EVP&#39;s, I =\r\nfeel a nausea as well. I am thinking it is more likely a manifestation in m=\r\ny mind, but then again I rule nothing out, just make note! Again I am a ske=\r\nptic by nature but not because I do not want to believe. I personally seek =\r\ntruth even when it is not in my liking, perhaps because I want so much to b=\r\nelieve. Im sure many of us here can relate. Another thing about my first ex=\r\nperience with the box was, Bill asked if there was any one in the room it w=\r\nanted to communicate too? It said Tina   Maria (twice I heard it), and anot=\r\nher person&#39;s name that was present in the room, it also kept calling Bill t=\r\nhe\n owners name. I never opened my mouth the whole time. I felt that to man=\r\ny people in the room were talking at the box and to each other, which &quot;almo=\r\nst&quot;??? seemed to render it in effective. I personally think that we do not =\r\nneed to ask it any questions or call upon any specific spirit etc... for it=\r\n to communicate. What is there will utilize the white noise and expose itse=\r\nlf. I am very new to this and do not claim to know much.....but I certainly=\r\n feel this box is in its pioneer stage of something credible. Thanx for you=\r\nr thoughts Frank. How do I get a box made? Im sure you have posted it somew=\r\nhere, and I am too new to do it myself at this time.\nTinamarie\n\n\n\n----- Ori=\r\nginal Message ----\nFrom: Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-=\r\nITC@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Saturday, July 21, 2007 7:40:17 PM\nSubject: Re: [=\r\nEVP-ITC] Re: New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n\nThanks Tinamarie;\n\nI wonder if y=\r\nou could pcik up on the energy they supposedly focused on the \nbox?

This one is one of them! Very nice, very interesting, \n&gt;defin=\r\natley something happening! I am fixin to get my own and start as well. \n&gt;I =\r\ngot to witness the box belonging to Bill Murphy at a Paranormal Meetup \n&gt;gr=\r\noup.
