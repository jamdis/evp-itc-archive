Light is both a particle and a wave, depending on what you're looking for, =
or how you measure it.=C2=A0 That goes for everything on the electro-magnet=
ic (EM) spectrum, of which light is part, but gravity is not.

According to=
 current science, there are 4 fundamental forces in the universe: EM is one=
, and gravity is another (and then the others I think are strong and weak f=
orces at the atomic level).
