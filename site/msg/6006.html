There must be a lot going on behind the scenes this weekend that I  
didn&#x27;t see. I saw a bad thread spiral into a worse thread, but if  
that is all the heat it takes to kill us crabs, we&#x27;re not as strong  
as we think.

If you wanna fill me in on some of this missing back story privately,  
I&#x27;d be appreciative.

&gt; Anne,
&gt; I know just where Bruce is coming from here, cause I have
&gt; to be honest, I feel the same way. If you taking a look at the
&gt; posts from the weekend, there is nothing but mud slinging and
&gt; disrespect directed towards our research. The conversations were in
&gt; no way even a heathly debate. It&#x27;s ok to disagree and be opened
&gt; minded, but sometimes some people you just have to shake you head and
&gt; walk away. No matter what you say your response will never be right
&gt; in their eyes.
&gt;
&gt; I joinned this group over almost 2 years ago. I have watched,
&gt; listened and learned from many. I have observed those who in my
&gt; opinion have taked advantage of Frank as well as the others and had
&gt; nothing but selfish movities on their agenda. I have seen people BEG
&gt; for boxes, have threated people via email and telephone, to the point
&gt; where it has been come hate towards what we are doing.
&gt;
&gt; I have stayed slient regarding this for a long while, and its about
&gt; time that if you can not be professional, curtious, and serious about
&gt; what we are all doing here as a whole, THEN DON&#x27;T LET THE DOOR HIT
&gt; YOU IN THE ASS!
&gt;
&gt; See regardless whether we post to this board or not, those who will
&gt; continue the work will always be in contact and be dedicated to this
&gt; work no matter what!

&gt; &gt; Bruce,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Please breathe and relax. You&#x27;re very stressed today, obviously.
&gt; How
&gt; &gt; can so few and little flames mean anything to someone who has been
&gt; &gt; through the terrible fires that you have? You matter here and your
&gt; &gt; help is invaluable. You are also our friend and would be terribly
&gt; &gt; missed here.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Peace and affection,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Fellow researchers,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have decided to back away from participating in this group for a
&gt; &gt; &gt; while. The constant clash of ego&#x27;s and childish bickering of
&gt; which I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have become a big part has begun to affect my research in a
&gt; negative
&gt; &gt; &gt; way.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been advised to retreat from being an active part of this
&gt; &gt; &gt; group for an undetermined amount of time. I would like to stay on
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; rolls as a member but will not actively participate as far as
&gt; posting
&gt; &gt; &gt; results, files or opinions and advice.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I will however be posting the results of my research on my box
&gt; website
&gt; &gt; &gt; if there are any of you who would like to hear them.
&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; For the new members, please do not let my comments on this matter
&gt; &gt; &gt; affect your opinion of this research. I have chosen not to
&gt; &gt; &gt; participate here for personal reasons. I will be devoting all my
&gt; &gt; &gt; energy to advancing the communication and technology.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If any new members feel they value my advice please feel free to
&gt; &gt; &gt; privately e-mail me paranormalinvestigating@...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I will be glad to help anyone but will not offer advice on any
&gt; &gt; &gt; subjects posted here.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you to all the friends that I have managed to make here you
&gt; &gt; &gt; have been an immeasurable help.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you
