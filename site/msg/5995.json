Hey I have posted \nsome evp&#39;s in Ralph&#39;s Research Folder on here for your pleasure to \nlisten to. I really don&#39;t care if anyone thinks they are fake or miss \nidentified sounds. All I care about is that to me they are real and I \ndid my time working on them and I don&#39;t have to prove to any Skeptics \nthat what I have is evidence of the here after. You will never \nconvince them and so why bother. All I know is what I got is enough \nevidence for me. You might believe it if you were here beside me at \nthe time I am getting the evidence but we can&#39;t all be in one place \nat the same time and no one can prove it otherwise to others who \nquestion their validity unless they were there. Myself I believe all \nof those that post their evidence on here are not trying to decieve \npeople with fake evidence. They are just sharing their experience \nwith what they consider evidence for themselves and to let all of us \nhear that evidence and compare notes. If we are all believers in this \nfield and are true to ouselves and this forum why do we have to prove \nanything to others who question our methods as long as we are sharing \nour experinces and getting results that we are satisfied with, to the \ngroup on here. It&#39;s nice to share our thoughts and methods and \nknowledge on this subject. Whatever method works for you and you get \nresults who cares what others think as long as your happy with the \nfinished results is all that matters. Can I ask what radio station \nsays &quot; F--k Off &quot; on it and could that be just a snippet of some \nradio station that does not go by the rules of the FCC ? What radio \nstation would say &quot; Hurry dead battery &quot; and then a few minutes later \nmy batteries died ? You just can&#39;t convince a skeptic. So I say let&#39;s\nhave fun with our experiments and not squabble over SKEPTICS. Let&#39;s \nenjoy the experience of sharing and not nit picking. I enjoy all the \nstuff people are presenting with all of their posts. It&#39;s very \ninteresting. Keep up the good work all of you that love this field.\nI&#39;m just a Postal worker. I&#39;m no Rocket Scientist and not a \nprofessional by any means and I sure as heck am not an expert in this \nfield, but I enjoy the friendship of those who love this exciting \nfield such as all of you who are representing here. I thank you all \nfor your comments whether good or bad on the postings I put on here.\nWe have been getting some great stuff on the EVP postings as I have \nheard, so keep it up and have a great time doing it. Well enough of \nthat 2 cents. If you have any questions on my EVPs just give me a \nholler. Peace to everyone and keep that info flowing. Knowldege is a \nterrible thing to waste LOL.\n\nRegards,\nRalph the Ghost Hunter"}
