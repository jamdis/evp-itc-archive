You folks could go over to Seraph group list, and post files there, plenty  
of room over there, since my members have been there so long, they are very 
 quiet too, I'm sure they won't mind.  They might enjoy seeing them  too.

This type of file sharing is new to me. I  have a photo album site for 
sharing and uploading photos, but you can't upload  files. I didn't know there 
were file sharing sites until joined this group,  but I had always thought 
there should be.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: File uploading  rules DO NOT UPLOAD WAV FILES



LOL Snowfire! Nope it was not you this time. Others should read before  
they post because we just addressed this subject. Esnips is very easy to use  
it has two uploading options in case you cant use the java application use  
the single file uploader. Works alot like email upload  attachments.

If you need more help just holler and I am sure one of  us will be more 
than willing to help you figure it out. Posting from email  as an attachment 
also works just not so well for the very large file sizes.  There are many 
other file sharing storage places besides esnips. We just  like the layout 
there and the ability to share with friends including  sharing storage space.
