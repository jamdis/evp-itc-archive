The one built in \n&gt; Aug 2006 with a date code of 08A06.  Radio Shack now has a newer \n&gt; version of the 12-470 that is showing up in some stores.  As of this \n&gt; time, no modification has been found for the newer version, date code \n&gt; of 06A07 (June 2007) (Black case). If you plan to modify a 12-470 make \n&gt; sure you buy the older version (Gray and white case) which can be seen \n&gt; in my video at www.ufogeek.com\n&gt; The newer 12-470 looks similar to the 12-469 in style, except the 12-\n&gt; 470 is black, has a speaker, and a green ring around the button on the \n&gt; front; where the 12-469 is white, has no speaker and a blue ring around \n&gt; the button on the front.\n&gt; The older 12-470 is gray and white, with three silver button on the \n&gt; front where the speaker is located. I&#39;m assuming all the older versions \n&gt; of the 12-470 can be modified, but that is just an assumption.  They \n&gt; changed the circuit boards on the newer version of the 12-470 and there \n&gt; is no wire bundle lke in the older version.\n&gt;\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Hi there, The RS 12-469 I got is a 08A07 (on box&#39;s back) & the manual says it&#39;s a 12-469 03A07.   Need to open it to see IF it can be modified via &quot;pin&quot; removal. Thanks.    =Judy="}
