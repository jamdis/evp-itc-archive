Actually I saw it on some local (not to me)(fox??) news show once before, you guys will have to dig for that one.
   
  They had thier video newsclips available online. I forget who posted the link. Was a long time ago. Its probably not available anymore unless they did massive archives of thier clips. Not sure.
