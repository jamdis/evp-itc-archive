<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Dave, I found now the discussion on this topic in the ITC Bridge
forum. Very interesting, as well as this whole overunity and free energy
stuff. The Dr. Stiffler website www.drstiffler.com seems to be closed,
but on http://67.76.235.52/ there are still contents online, including
schematics of Spatial Energy Coherence (SEC) Driver Circuits. A lot of
stuff to read... :o

&gt; Hi Stefan,

&gt; I&#x27;m attaching a very basic block diagram of the system. The initial
&gt; tones are software generated. The software is called &#x27;Audio Mulch&#x27;.
&gt; The function to use is called &#x27;10 Harmonics&#x27;. I use a base frequency
&gt; of 102hz. The waveform must be adjusted so the peaks are flat across
&gt; the envelope, you will see what I mean when using the software, there
&gt; is a free trial version of the software. The information on the SEC
&gt; LED driver is available on Dr Stifflers web site. I do not have a link
&gt; as the site pages seem to change frequently.

&gt; Here is another example from the system
&gt; &quot;I&#x27;m glad your talking...and also watching&quot;

&gt; Thanks for your interest,
&gt; Dave</pre>
