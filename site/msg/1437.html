<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>No I don&#x27;t, I would guess Chris is doing that because he was in area with 
few AM stations, but it would better to add more wire to the antenna, or 
maybe use a commercailly available amplified antenna. C.Crane sells the 
select-a-tenna that would probably produce spectacular results.

&gt;I see in this YouTube video  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-wQZ7FU2Vc  
&gt;Where Chris Moon is holding on to the antenna for enhanced effect. Does 
&gt;anyone know if Frank uses this same method when he records?
&gt;Thanks,

&gt;Yeah Steve, I&#x27;m not real vocal to begin with but it has been
&gt;abnormally slow. I think everyone is real busy getting their ducks in
&gt;a row for the upcoming holiday.  Who knows? LOL
&gt;
&gt;Yeah, Rosemary wrote the articles for TAPS mag and its probably one of
&gt;the best portrayals of the Frank&#x27;s box there is. At least Rosemary
&gt;actually spoke with, witnessed and interviewed people who know a
&gt;little about this machine, to include Frank himself. Its nice to read
&gt;a positive, informed account rather than the guessing and stabbing in
&gt;the dark I have heard and written by ignorant naysayers.
&gt;
&gt;Kudos Rosemary!

&gt; &gt; This is an incredible field and nobody has posted in days.  Just
&gt; &gt; thought i&#x27;d throw it out there and maybe get somebody&#x27;s attention.
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ll have to post more files i guess to keep this going.  The box was
&gt; &gt; in TAPS paramag, anybody read that?
