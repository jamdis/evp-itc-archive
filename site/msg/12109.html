<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I find that i miss a lot in real-time when doing a session live.  
That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s always good to record and review what you may have  
missed.  I would love to hear your recordings and see what you&#x27;ve 
been getting.  And you are using a mobile phone....that&#x27;s 
interesting.  That continues to prove that they will use anything we 
have to communicate.

Good Job and continued success,
-Steve H.

&gt; Within the last week I came across the concept of the ghost box 
&gt; (Frank&#x27;s box) and have had immediate results.
&gt; 
&gt; This is actually using a mobile phone on radio mode with a manual 
scan, 
&gt; simply holding down the button and it scans through the FM bands 
either 
&gt; up or down. There was no white noise being played at the same time 
nor 
&gt; on review.
&gt; 
&gt; What surprised me was the clarity of the answers to direct 
questions 
&gt; which could then be checked on a reviewing the tape. But also that 
on 
&gt; one ocassion the replies weren&#x27;t audible until the replay of the 
taped 
&gt; session was heard.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this typical?
&gt; 
&gt; I can upload the sessions which are quite interesting due to the 
&gt; subject being discussed.
