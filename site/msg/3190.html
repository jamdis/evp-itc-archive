 It's not that concerns are not considered, I think no one knows what to d=
o with it. There's not enough box users, and ITC researchers out there to r=
eally good feel for what the pitfalls are. So far after seven years of EVP/=
ITC work I can say onlly that these dark entities, or wahtever it is talk b=
ad, and threaten, and that's about all they do. They threaten, I tell them =
to bring it, and....nothin'! Paper tigers I say. 
 
 As far as some fears t=
hat portals are opened, and all kinds of evil comes in, I don't believe tha=
t either. They are already have full access, they already exist in more dem=
ensions, making this physical level about the lowest level of spiritual exi=
stence/evolution. Just about all these worries are old fear crap to keep pe=
ople in church. 
 
 I don't think it's fair to with hold the stuff cuz of a=
 few nut jobs, you have the same problem with everything from bicycles to a=
irplanes. 
 
 I had that concern about selling my boxes, but how would you =
screen users? You can't. Not everyone can use a quija board, and not too ma=
ny unbalanced ding dongs get in trouble with those anyway.

I am a fa=

 the fact that many who purchase the mini-boxwill not be of the right frame=
 of mind. Most will not be in harmony.Many will take "the dark guys" seriou=

All in the name ofsharing technology.I know that my previous posts expressi=
ng my concern over the massmarketing of the box, was barely given considera=
tion. Realize that Iam not being selfish- I do not own a box. EVP is my pas=
sion and hasbeen from day one 6 years ago when I jumped fully into the fiel=
d. I amsuccessful in capturing EVP, always have been. I still do it the "ol=
dfashioned way" with open air techniques. Would I love to be able tohold re=

 approval let alone production of these boxes. Those of us who have been on=
 countless investigations with many peoplewill quickly admit that there are=
 some people we'd rather notinvestigate with. When they are present, negati=

 dark" fromthe first meeting. We all admit that being mentally sound is ani=
mportant quality in this field. If you have mental issues, this maynot be t=
he area of research for you. We don't bring children oninvestigations for o=
bvious reasons. BUT! If you want a box that couldpossibly open up a portal =
and bridge the gap between here and thedark, sure! Anyone who wants one sho=
uld have it! You might feel that I am over reacting or being overly dramati=
c.That's fine. My concern is not what you think of me but that youconsider =
the possibilities here. Many of which we do not know. Can yoube 100% sure t=
