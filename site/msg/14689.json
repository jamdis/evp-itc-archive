I was asked to give a short demonstration with my Optimus 12-797 hacked radio. Deep inside the prison surrounded by concrete and steel, the radio could not pick up any radio stations in manual mode. I wasn&#39;t sure how this might effect the demonstration. I was pleasantly suprised with the results. I recorded the session and the results can be heard at this link. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwDYu4RULlk"}
