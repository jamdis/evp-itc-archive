Nibiru - Armageddon Planet or Astronomical Baloney?

The scoop: Conspiracy theorists are con=
vinced a rogue planet will destroy the Earth in 2012, and just as we are ab=
out to see the release of a Hollywood movie on the topic, the hype is set t=
o increase. David Morrison, a NASA astrobiologist and expert scientist for =
NASA's Ask an Astrobiologist website, calls for a reality check and in 2008=
 he contributed this article to Discovery News.

Unbeknownst to most of us,=
 a small but vocal group of conspiracy theorists is convinced that a rogue =
planet is about to enter the inner solar system and doom the Earth.

They s=
ay that this threatening planet on a 3600-year orbit was discovered by the =
ancient Mesopotamians, who named it Nibiru, and it was known also to the Ma=
yans, who associated it with the end of their calendar "long count" in Dece=
mber 2012. In Web sites, blogs, and radio talk shows, they insist that NASA=
 is tracking Nibiru -- but that this information is being kept from the pub=
lic as part of a worldwide conspiracy.

They say the official silence can't=
 be maintained for much longer, however, because by 2009 Nibiru will be vis=
ible to the naked eye from the southern hemisphere. They also say Earth's a=
xis is already tilting and the length of the day is changing under its infl=
uence. As one believer recently wrote to me, "Why are you lying. It's comin=
g, and everyone knows it."

I began to receive questions about this bizarre=
 story in December 2007 through NASA's "Ask an Astrobiologist" site. Normal=
ly I receive up to a dozen questions per week from the public, dealing most=
ly with life in the universe -- but in the past 6 months the Nibiru traffic=
 alone has grown to 20-25 messages a week, ranging from the anguished "I ca=
n't sleep," "I am really scared" or "I don't want to die" to the abusive "y=
ou are putting my family at risk" and "if NASA denies it then it must be tr=
ue."

As a scientist, I'm both fascinated and astonished by the deluge of q=
uestions from people who are genuinely frightened and, apparently, unable t=
o distinguish astronomical fact from fiction. They're watching YouTube vide=
os and visiting slick Web sites with nothing in their skeptical toolkit, or=
 to quote Carl Sagan no "baloney detector." Now a blockbuster disaster film=
 called "2012" is set for release in the summer of 2009, and the commercial=
 enterprise is clearly trying to cash in on people's concern (perhaps contr=
ibuting to their fear as well).

My guess is that only a tiny fraction of p=
eople truly believes that Armageddon is coming in December 2012. But their =
uncritical acceptance of this story worries me as a warning of the dangers =
of our current scientific illiteracy.

We're facing monumental problems wit=
h global warming and loss of habitat, yet a substantial minority of America=
ns thinks the world was formed less than 10,000 years ago and deny that evo=
lution is possible. Many Americans seem to prefer coal-fired generators to =
nuclear power plants without realizing the toll in public health that coal =
imposes. Billions are spent, including tax-payer dollars, for so-called alt=
ernative medicine with no scientific evidence for its efficacy. And legisla=
tors often resist efforts to collect the data that could actually demonstra=
te which government programs are effective and which ones don't work as int=
ended.

In spite of my frustrations, I can always hope that Nibiru will tur=
n into a teaching moment. Its proponents are convinced that it will be visi=
ble to the unaided eye this coming spring, and its effects on the rotation =
and orbit of the Earth will be obvious by summer (just in time for the rele=
ase of the film "2012"). When none of this happens, I hope they'll realize =
that they need better tools to distinguish fact from fiction.
