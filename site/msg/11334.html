<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My p1 filter. It&#x27;s just settings for use with Clear Voice Denoiser. Works well for me on h2o method voices. If anyone wants to try it you can download it off my site under software. By default settings are loud to amp thier voice above the water noise.

&gt; 
&gt; I was wondering who you were in messenger. I sent you back
&gt; an add request. Welcome to the group. 
&gt; 
&gt; I had a chance to check your file. Water sounds are
&gt; evident. I took the liberty of putting them thru my water
&gt; filter. Some interesting results. I will give that to you
&gt; later if I see you on.

&gt; &gt; Hi everyone just to introduce myself. I&#x27;m Ray from
&gt; &gt; Yorkshire England, 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve been doing research into EVP for a while now
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; always on the 
&gt; &gt; lookout for improved techniques and better results.
&gt; Just
&gt; &gt; uploaded my 
&gt; &gt; first file under Ray&#x27;s File&#x27;s. I obtained this
&gt; EVP
&gt; &gt; while exploring a 
&gt; &gt; disused Lead Mine here in Yorkshire I was alone and
&gt; armed
&gt; &gt; with a torch 
&gt; &gt; and Olympus VN-120pc digital voice recorder. If you
&gt; loop
&gt; &gt; the file you 
&gt; &gt; can hear the noise of dripping water from the roof of
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; Mine and a 
&gt; &gt; distinct voice saying &quot;help Me&quot;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks
&gt; &gt; Ray
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;
