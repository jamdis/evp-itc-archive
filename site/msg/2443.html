  File        : /Simple FM Sweep Radio Design/no_no.mp3 
  Uploaded by : urkel232002 &lt;urkel23@...&gt; 
  Description : &quot;No-----No&quot;   ---- Frank, i know you don&#x27;t like the question and answer sessions, but this is an example of a real 2-way conversation verified.  They answer &quot;No&quot; and i repeat for confirmation &quot;No&quot; and than they say it again to confirm what i heard was right. Getting answers to questions that you ask is beneficial to this.  Of course i could get messages without saying a word, but isn&#x27;t better to know when a message is coming so you can review that section of audio to find the answer.
