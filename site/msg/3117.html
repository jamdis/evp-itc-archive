<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Glad to do it. By the way, I also thought the MiniBox was well built
and had decent clarity. April and Alex were very gracious and sincere
in  demonstrating and explaining everything.

 And everyone that met you Frank was pleased to hear what you had to
say and as you witnessed, there are a few different ways people use
the Box. The attendees of the event that were not familiar with your 
Box seemed to get it almost right away. I think everyone who was there
appreciated you explaining the concept and it was great to see a group
of people seated up close to listen to you and your Box 25. No one was
rushing to leave the billiards room where you were set up even though
it was past 2 a.m. and most had been up all weekend. Thanks for
showing up!

&gt; Thanks Bill!!!!!
&gt;  
&gt;  I have only two boxes at the moment, one is not meant for travel,
as I have it set up with a seperate power supply, and sound chamber
for testing. The other is the new printed circuit version that has a
couple problems still.  I showed this one at the Stanley over the
weekend. There is the box made by paranormalsystems.com, it works, and
there is a sound sample on the site. I saw the Mini Box at the Stanley
and was impressed.

&gt; Judy, I&#x27;m near Hollywood and I work with a small group of like
mindedresearchers. We have a Frank&#x27;s Box and you&#x27;ll never, ever have
to eventhink we would ask for anything from you to participate in a
Boxsession. -Bill--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com,

started the research with a box i was lucky to have made based &gt; off &gt;
&gt; of Frank&#x27;s idea. As all on this board one way or another would &gt;
have &gt; &gt; done anything to get their hands on one of Frank&#x27;s boxes or &gt;
&gt; something equivalent. So, now it&#x27;s your chance to get another &gt; &gt;
version of an already great idea and everyone&#x27;s complaining. Isn&#x27;t &gt; &gt;
this the answer to everyone&#x27;s problem, it may be pricey but i know &gt; &gt;
people who would have paid more in the past for a similar item. &gt; &gt;
This board is for research, this is just another idea just like &gt; &gt;
Joe&#x27;s idea of joe&#x27;s box and frank&#x27;s &quot;frank&#x27;s box&quot;. If this version &gt; &gt;
doesn&#x27;t work, than the idea will kill itself. But, now people can &gt; &gt;
get to see if they are truly meant to work with the other side or &gt; &gt;
one of the 30 or 80 or whatever the number is up to now. I think &gt; if
&gt; &gt; you don&#x27;t like this minibox than don&#x27;t buy it, but isn&#x27;t anybody &gt;
&gt; curious to see the results people get with it or don&#x27;t. Just my &gt; &gt;
take on it, i think it&#x27;s crazy that everyone is getting so upset &gt; &gt;
about another form of communication. It took me back at first &gt; &gt;
because i felt this would kill my research, but we don&#x27;t know if &gt; &gt;
this even works yet. These things happen for a reason by stuff out &gt; &gt;
of our control. All we can do is sit back and watch, and who &gt; didn&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; think someone was going to mass produce this idea eventually &gt; &gt;
anyway? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Steve H.&gt; &gt;&gt; - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - - - - - - -&gt; Hi Steve H., My thoughts are if the boxes
DO work well for &gt; those that are truely interested in doing research
with them - &gt; daily!! I&#x27;d still like to experience one, but am in L.A.
- where no &gt; one&#x27;s doing Public demos of it = UGH! Chris -who was in
San diego &gt; today wants $125. for the admission!! Yikes! =Judy=&gt;
