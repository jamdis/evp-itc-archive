<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Aluminum wire is a nightmare! The stuff tends to overheat, oxidizes where
interconnections are made and will spark, etc.

I bought a transformer at Gateway Electronics in St. Louis some years ago
that looked like a great transformer for a high-current 12 volt supply. The
secondary appeared to be wound with #8 enameled wire. I found out the
secondary was wound with aluminum wire. After I built the power supply and
tried to get 20 amps from it but couldn&#x27;t, I gave up on it and got another
transformer wound with copper wire.

&gt;   We have a touch lamp that comes on by itself, and we have electric

&gt; is on. When the furnace comes on, it affects the boxes, and--when I first
&gt; started doign EVP recordings with white noise, if the furnace happened to
&gt; come on when I was recording a voice would report &quot;it&#x27;s on fire!&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;  What if that house has aluminum wire?

&gt;&gt;  Thanks! Would that account for the tapping noise?

&gt;&gt;    Yes.  Also faulty wiring, which is even more dangerous.
&gt;&gt; Also with flakey transformers or other power distribution in the area, or
&gt;&gt; power lines.
&gt;&gt; Perhaps you can check with some neighbors, and see how their power is
&gt;&gt; doing.

&gt;&gt;   Hi All,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is there someone here that can answer and electrical question for me?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; During the case that I recorded those possible EVP&#x27;s-there was a loud
&gt;&gt; tapping noise that seemed to come from the 2nd bedroom. Upon checking my
&gt;&gt; logs, every time one of  these clicks were heard, there would be an EMF
&gt;&gt; spike in the livingroom. The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the livingroom
&gt;&gt; downstairs. The home owners have also reported that they have a touch lamp
&gt;&gt; that comes on all the time by itself and the lights in the Kitchen will dim
&gt;&gt; occasionally.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Now these taps are not consistent in timing, loudness or rhythm. Could
&gt;&gt; this be the work of faulty breakers?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks!
&gt;&gt; April
