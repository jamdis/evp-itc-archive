<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>thanks for the pointer.  I hope someone else can find it, as I&#x27;ve
looked around there and really don&#x27;t see what you&#x27;ve described.

&gt; Thought I had it in a file but cannot find. Be clear on this
however, it was a test with parameters similar to what you suggested.
Not simply comments as you implied. Again, if you take time to
research that site you will find much to look at. Maybe Margaret (I
she reads this) knows the date, etc. because she is an active member
there as she is here with many posts of her evp sessions. good luck ron

&gt; Oh ok. I didn&#x27;t realize is was just some ocmments at that site,
&gt; rather than a more formal study. So thanks anyways. If you come up
&gt; with the reference though, I&#x27;d be happy to check it out.

&gt; &gt; Interesting - do you have a link to that blind test? 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;d like to learn more about their methodology.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sounds good. Count me in on the test. By the way, some here might
&gt; be interested in knowing that the American Association of EVP did a
&gt; similar blind test and their results showed about a 33% hit rate for
&gt; people getting the same words from a file. That would be a pretty
&gt; good number to match, I would think. Sarcasum can be an effective way
&gt; to make things happen at times.And that&#x27;s not being sarcastic.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Reading the posts from the last week as I do every sat morning it
is my 
&gt; &gt; opinion that some of them have a very polite condescending tone to 
&gt; &gt; them.This group and the people in it have always been very helpful
and 
&gt; &gt; a joy to do research with I hope it stays that way I would hate to
see 
&gt; &gt; it become one of &quot;those&quot; boards if you know what I mean (my 1 cent
had 
&gt; &gt; to do it). so anyway
&gt; &gt; One productive idea that I saw from one of this weeks posts was to
send 
&gt; &gt; the same file privitly to a few people and see what they hear in it. 
&gt; &gt; Unpromtide by file names or other posts about it. I have a couple
files 
&gt; &gt; that I feel are pretty clear. So if you would like to volunteer just 
&gt; &gt; send me an email with your email adress and I will send you a file
not 
&gt; &gt; too long but it will be unedited and in its original form.
&gt; &gt; I will not amplify it or edit or change it in anyway from its
original. 
&gt; &gt; Those who recive the files do the same NO editing untill you render 
&gt; &gt; your opinion to me about it after that you can do what u like with it.
&gt; &gt; Remember after listening email me DO NOT post what you hear on the 
&gt; &gt; board I will do that later when I have everyones opinion.
