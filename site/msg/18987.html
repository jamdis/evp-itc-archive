&gt; in  WI, you pushed me!&quot; &quot;there&#x27;s two groups&quot; &quot;trying to get some action&quot; In 
&gt; the  third I hear, &quot;Them 17&quot; In the forth I hear: &quot;Kevin, Tim, this is big, 
&gt; Ken is  awsome, shepherd, Kristin, Yes Sir, 3, 5 or 6&quot; Anderson&quot;  Ted, Teddy, 
&gt; is  outside of here, hi outsiders.&quot;  sure there is more, but that&#x27;s what i

&gt; I purposely left these files without my own interpretations of what they  
&gt; say. Some are obvious, some less obvious. Please let me know what you  hear.
