This experiment asks for participants to determine what\n&gt; that object is. Vague or partial answers won&#39;t be counted (for example, just\n&gt; giving a color, shape, size, what it&#39;s made of, etc): we&#39;re looking for what\n&gt; it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Monday won&#39;t count. Participants\n&gt; can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means they chose. At\n&gt; the end of the experiment, I will reveal the object, and a tally of the\n&gt; number of correct and/or incorrect answers.\n&gt;\n&gt; In order to keep me honest, I have taken a picture of the object at the\n&gt; start of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of\n&gt; this group. The idea with this file is that you can download it now and\n&gt; &#39;keep it safe&#39; on your computer. Then at the end of the experiment, I will\n&gt; post the password so you can reveal the contents of the file. That way, you\n&gt; were in control of the original image during the entire test, not me. If you\n&gt; can follow the link, it is here:\n&gt;\n&gt; Windows users:\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.win.zip\n&gt;\n&gt; Mac users:\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.mac.zip\n&gt;\n&gt; And if you do not care to download the zip file now, I will post the final\n&gt; image there at the end of the experiment anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; My monitor is one of the older box-like SONY CRTs, and says &quot;Trinitron&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;Multiscan 200sf&quot; on the upper front. I have a couple monitors stacked in my\n&gt; closet too: they are not the monitors used in this experiment (and have\n&gt; nothing else on them anyway), and I have several laptops around: they are\n&gt; also not the monitors in this experiment. The monitor in this experiment is\n&gt; the only SONY monitor I have, says &quot;SONY in various places on it, can be\n&gt; seen in the following link from the first experiment, when the correct\n&gt; answer would have been &quot;radio&quot;:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG\n&gt;\n&gt; Please post all answers to the group thread: that way, there will be a\n&gt; public record and I won&#39;t get accused of losing any answers.\n&gt;\n&gt; And best of luck to all the participants!\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nThis is AWESOME!!!!We did se e al expe imen s like his on he Magic Ca e and he esul s we e amazing.
