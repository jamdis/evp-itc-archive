My first evp was my mothers voice and no boxes were involved=\r\n. The box is a tool/method and there are many ways to get their voices hear=\r\nd. So in the different methods I have used, yes I have heard voices that re=\r\nsemble their lifetime charachteristics and tones. Is it always that way? No=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; Most often the group will speak as one voice because I have request=\r\ned they do so. One voice tone will begin a sentence and another will end it=\r\n. So I may hear my female friends voice start off a thought and an unknown =\r\nmale voice finish the sentence. And vice versa often they speak in tones wh=\r\nich do not even come close to what they sounded like in life. Quite often t=\r\nhey are spirits I didnt know in life. I may get someone saying This is edis=\r\non, and then find an old recording he did where he starts it off saying Thi=\r\ns is edison, but for me I do not know the man so there is no recognition fo=\r\nr me. I document it and file it away as a curiousity.\n&gt; \n&gt; I always laugh w=\r\nhen people say thats not your mother or friend thats something trying to fo=\r\nol you and mess with your head. I knew my mother longer than anyone and its=\r\n interesting that it is easier for those people to believe that its possibl=\r\ne that something/someone else is speaking pretending to be my mother but it=\r\ns much harder for them to believe that quite possibly that really is my mot=\r\nher keeping her promise to stay in touch after death. If one is possible th=\r\nen so is the other. I tend to be stubborn in some respects in that I dont i=\r\nnstantly believe what anyone tells me whether living or not. If they give m=\r\ne a message I think is dumb I am very reluctant to pass it on and usually t=\r\nhose are the ones that get the biggest confirmations tho it means nothing t=\r\no me at the time. So yes quite possibly evp work can be used the same as me=\r\ndiumship in missing persons cases.\n&gt; \n&gt; For me tone of voice has grown to m=\r\nean nothing. It is a treat when they manage to come across sounding as they=\r\n did when in physical form here but I look beyond the tone of voice. Often =\r\npeople get a childs voice and they become saddened by the thought that a ch=\r\nild is earthbound. But I see it just as a representation of voice and wheth=\r\ner it comes across as male female child or robot matters little to me.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I do find they often resume the &quot;character&quot; they played because after all =\r\nthat is sort of what we are, characters in some giant play. Whether it is t=\r\nhe beliefs they had which were their trademark, the tone of voice, their im=\r\nage, or use of some nickname even I dont know about I look at it all as jus=\r\nt a pixel in a larger portrait that some part survives once the body has ce=\r\nased to function.
