Insults? You are the one who posts insults. Frank's reply to an email,(addr=
essed to him by the way), was not addressed to you. But, you felt it necess=
ary to respond with a snide, cryptic remark.
You state you are here to find=
 "the truth".? Have you ever tried to communicate with a spirit box? Are yo=
u a Paranormal Investigator? I haven't seen any posts where you offer any i=
nformation about your beliefs.=C2=A0I responded to your post last week and =
you ignored me. This is a group of "like minded "people who discuss RTSC se=
ssions and share findings we others. We exchange ideas and offer help to on=
e another in our search for answers. =C2=A0Your snide snippets only serve t=
o demean others . =C2=A0Now that I have explained my position, you can now =
accuse me of slinging insults and being part of a cult.!

Frank,

Very interesting. It's been =
a while since I've listenend to your files. The fm on this tuner sounds rea=

This is what I=
 hear (in studio grade headphones):

Your AM file @ 03 secs: "Here Prin Ces=
s" (male + two escalating tones)
@ 11 secs: "Be sure (static) good news" (m=
ale)

Your FM file @ 01 secs: "Trying to get through" (in female tones)
@ 0=
3 secs: "It don't ?boost? right" (male then two tones)
@ 05 secs: "Closer t=
o cooperating? " (male, first vowel sound is hard and second vowel sound in=
 this word is a soft 'a' or 'o' so it cannot be calamity)
@ 06 secs: "Till =
we're done" (female, fast)
@ 08 secs: "Frank" (male)
@ 09 secs: "Hi" (femal=
e singing, drawn out) 
@ 11 secs: "How you doing" (male)
@ 14 secs: "Hi" (f=
emale or child)
