Someone who is a part of this group for a longer length has no more rights than a newbie. I joined EVP-ITC not IPAA.  If I read messages sent from EVP-ITC I expect stuff related to that group ONLY.  If I join IPAA and read messages sent from IPAA then I expect stuff related to that group ONLY as well.\n \nIf the message is sent by EVP-ITC and I open it and it is about something else entirely under the assumption it was about EVP-ITC, I WAS MADE TO READ IT. I&#39;m sorry you cannot make that distinction.\n \nThere is a difference between mentioning something off handedly vs. running an entire ad. I do have the right to reject spam.\n \nThe moderator did reply to me and that was sufficient. Thank you very much.\n \n~Clara\n\n--- On Tue, 12/2/08, Early Cuyler &lt;ecuyler@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Early Cuyler &lt;ecuyler@yahoo. com&gt;\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] The IPAA Official Nominees Site is now OPEN!\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\nDate: Tuesday, December 2, 2008, 1:29 PM\n\n\nThe IPAA is run by people who have been members for a long time.
