&gt;  In the future, I suggest no one forward material from another 
site, or blog to the group. It&#x27;s just to save feelings, and 
embarrassment, and it&#x27;s not appropriate.
&gt;  
&gt;  All should be careful of using other researchers names when being 
critical.
&gt;  
&gt;  If anyone is getting threats of &quot;legal action&quot;, I suggest it be 
reported to the FBI, so at least a pattern can be established. I&#x27;m 
pretty sure most of this stuff comes from out of a persons home 
state, that makes it federal. Slander is not even applicable to the 
internet, so threats of slander suits are harrassment to keep people 
from contradicting certain claims and research in this field, and as 
such, criminal. Although these criminals think they can say whatever 
they want about the rest of us. I suggest just let it go, and let the 
evidence speak for itself. 
&gt;  
&gt;  These people that would like to keep all this research private, 
and for their own use are in fact in this group. To keep them off I 
would have to make this a private group, or no group at all, and 
that&#x27;s not fair to the world. As I find out who these people are, 
that are in the groop under false pretenses, they will be banned. 
&gt;  
&gt;  If I feel threatened, or intimidated again, I will take 
appropriate action, and it won&#x27;t involve whinning!  I can grow a pair 
even at my age!
