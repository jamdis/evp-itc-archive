I know, if I had an old box, I would get it blessed, then put in silver  
wires, wish someone would toss one my way one day, even it's older one, if 
Bruce  doesn't want his, why doesn't he send one to me <g>

The TRF boxes are home made radios, even the glorious Radio Shack radio  
are plagued by noise when swept. You don't get so much in the hack boxes cuz  
you're jumping 10khz increments, skipping over the noise that's present when 
 the things are continuously swept.
