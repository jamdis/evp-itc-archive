<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t think there are any rules against that. What you got is what you

I for one am not offended and would like to hear them.

&gt; Hi guys :) I am new to EVP, but I was able to purchase a NEW sealed in
&gt; package Panasonic RR-DR60 from eBay for $130 shipped (I included an extra
&gt; $10 to get priority shipping WITH insurance) This DR60 has been truly
&gt; AMAZING!! I have a question. I have 2 EVP&#x27;s that have cursing words in them.
&gt; The &quot;F&quot; word. One is from a female saying &quot; I hit it.....Fu$k&quot; and another
&gt; Male (?) sorta mechanical (original mechanical voice without editing) that
&gt; says &quot;HEY....we don&#x27;t give a fu$k&quot; CAN I UPLOAD these (are very clear)
&gt; female is lower audio, but the male is easier to hear (although his vowles
&gt; are not as clear) Or would this be PROHIBITED. I don&#x27;t want to offend
&gt; anyone, just would like to give the true results as they are....we DO get
&gt; some &quot;negative&quot; results sometimes. Please advise. Thanks. Jim H
