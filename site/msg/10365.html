<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi, Misty.

Thanks for considering the ideas.  I try not to upload a whole lot, 
unless it is interesting.  It&#x27;s not that I do not have recordings, 
it&#x27;s just how many of these can a person store here, etc.  I would 
prefer just to maintain a small amount of them that are small file 
size as examples of what I am doing. Just let me know of any changes 
I should make...glad to do it.  

I understand moderating is a thankless job. So, thank you for doing 
it.  Not sure how anyone does it, to be honest.  It probably feels 
like being Barney Fife in a Mike Tyson-Evander Holyfield brawl on 
some of these message boards.  LOL ;)

&gt; Hiya LC
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah sorry about that I was pretty tired after dealin with work and 
&gt; junk. That&#x27;s definitely an idea to consider. Frank S. mentioned 
&gt; perhaps we can all just delete stuff after a set amount of time to 
&gt; keep it continuously clear like post stuff for couple weeks then it 
&gt; gets moved over to another server like esnips or elsewhere. All 
good 
&gt; ideas. 
&gt; 
&gt; I already started my transition and have moved many things over as 
&gt; well as deleted. I am considering making a group account that only 
&gt; group members can upload to (esnips allows that type of file 
sharing 
&gt; between friends) I just havent had the time or focus to put into 
&gt; setting it up (thats alot of emails to type in to add as friends 
&gt; LOL). Plus they are in middle of massive changes/updates so waiting 
&gt; for the dust to settle. I also considered getting a private server 
&gt; sharing system set up so people could upload thier stuff but seems 
&gt; complicated for most who arent used to using ftp.
&gt; 
&gt; Keep sharing ideas tho because eventually maybe we will make it 
&gt; better for everyone.
&gt; 
&gt; I rather not set limits on sizes but when ya hit 96% full 
somethings 
&gt; gotta go LOL so we start small and work our way to the resolution. 
I 
&gt; still attach most stuff to my posts for those that get individual 
&gt; emails it comes as a simple file attachment in email. So do many 
&gt; others here. That also helps.

&gt; &gt; Misty,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Can we just go to a file size limit?  Anything over 50 or 100kb 
has 
&gt; &gt; to be linked to?  This way we will cut down on the file strain 
&gt; &gt; without having to convert to mp3.  Many of the mp3 files are 
&gt; massive 
&gt; &gt; here.  My wav files are smaller...plus the mp3s don&#x27;t open up 
&gt; &gt; correctly for some of us.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I requested this yesterday, but it surely got lost in the 
&gt; fireworks.  
&gt; &gt; I have deleted some of my files, as well.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Deleting my files took it down about 3 percent, I noticed.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I have been sick and I&#x27;m plain worn down to a nub with all 
&gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; fighting.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I do appreciate you asking after me, Misty. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ll be around.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks Ann. I think going to more compacted files will help 
us 
&gt; &gt; all in 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the long run. We are already back to 72% rather than 96% tho 
&gt; most 
&gt; &gt; of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the file space was being used by someone else besides you =)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know it gets to be a bit testy around here and the other 
&gt; &gt; forums. I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also know that some of the nastiness can tear apart good 
&gt; working 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relationships as well as friendships. I was just askin Frank 
if 
&gt; &gt; he 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knew if you were still sick or not because you had been very 
&gt; &gt; quiet 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lately.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I agree sometimes its good to take a step back rather than 
get 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself caught up in the drama fests going on around us all. 
&gt; &gt; Thats 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on and off the board as well. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I said I know some of what goes on off of this forum, and 
I 
&gt; am 
&gt; &gt; sad 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to see most of it happening. I just hope everyone can regain 
&gt; &gt; focus 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and like you said, remember why we are here.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope you feel better soon, and rejoin us when the stress 
&gt; level 
&gt; &gt; is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; passed. And I hope it passes soon so ya can run some test 
&gt; &gt; sessions 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with the new tool that arrived!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I keep telling people that all the negativity does take a 
toll, 
&gt; &gt; on us 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personally and our working together.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m out of here until all this petty BS and hatred sorts 
out. 
&gt; &gt; The  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; amount of stress that I&#x27;ve been through with all this 
&gt; fighting 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; early this year has really taken a toll on me as a person 
and 
&gt; &gt; a  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; researcher. I&#x27;m going off line for awhile. If anyone wants 
to 
&gt; &gt; talk 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me, send me a private e-mail because I&#x27;m going to read 
&gt; only/no 
&gt; &gt; e-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mail  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; until I remember again why I used to wake up every day and 
&gt; want 
&gt; &gt; to  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; run to my computer to see what would be posted.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Misty--as per your request, I&#x27;ve deleted my files.
