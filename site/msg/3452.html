Ok,
It takes more work, you need to add a pic chip **=
 i'll post details tonight 
But you can now control the scan rate! right fr=
om the front control on the radio.
 
It works this way power on the unit pr=
ess up to scan up press down to scan down!
after that up  increases the sca=
n delay / Down decreases the scan delay!
 
Just a bit more function !

I'll have all the details tonight on www.ghostboxhacks.com

Hiya Bruce,
Yeah all of=
 the water files are sent thru the p1 process. It's the filter they helped =
to make for h2o. A few others can hear her voice tho I havent shared it wit=
h many. As always I just post and either ya hear it or ya dont. I think mal=

e h2o sessions. As for the other methods, again it depends on what we can h=
ear, what equipment we are using, what speakers are used to play them etcet=
era. For my ears?..yes most definitely! Most of them are for our ears in to=
ne and frequency we can process. 
 
Better luck next time! Oh and I liked w=
hat ya said in important message... it only echoes what I have been saying =
about working together is much more productive than working against each ot=
her. 
 
Harmony is hard to find in this community, everyone has thier own o=
pinions and is upset if others dont share it or if they cant hear what they=
 can or if someone disagrees it often leads to "blows". Theres no need for =

ject: [EVP-ITC] RACHEL FILES - I posted a bit of the Rachel collection for =
all.



As most! of you know by now as a child I grew up hearing constant c=
hatter nightly from a man and a woman. Thier voices always sounded like a t=
v playing in the other room but there would be no television on and no man =
and woman visible.
 
When I moved some of the strangeness followed tho I ne=
ver heard her voice again until I returned to that old house. Once I left a=
gain I didnt hear it again until I happened to start capturing thier speech=
 in evp research. Once I realized I was able to do this and pump up the vol=
ume, replay etcetera her voice returned. Only this time I often hear her cl=
early thanks to technology being what it is.
 
For the longest time I had n=
o clue who she was just that now and then I would hear "that womans" voice =
pop up in my evp. Also when I started doing this research many spirits spok=
e of a woman named Rachel. Visiting Rachel's house, talking about her like =
she was an angel or a guide or even thier grandmother. One day i decided to=
 ask a simple question. What was the name of the woman who was speaking, an=
d the reply I got quite stunned me. It was "her" voice saying the name Rach=
el. In some weird way it made some sort of crazy sense. All this time this =
spirit has been around me and I dont have the foggiest idea who she is just=
 that for some reason she has an interest in hanging around me for over 30 =
years now. I never saw her as a negative just slightly annoying and maybe a=
 bit spooky as a kid hehehe
 
On one hand it was quite disturbing growing u=
p with that...on the other its quite comforting to me now to have placed so=
me details on that "figment of my imagination" I was forced to live with. S=
hined a bit of light on the subject for me quite literally. 
 
Anyways a sh=
ort while back it occurred to me that I should start collecting her files t=
ogether in one collection so I started to do that. When I run across them i=
n my archives I copy them over or when I record a new one I will copy it ov=
er. I plan to do the same for Otto...he has quite a number of files tho he =
rarely speaks the others are always quick to fill in details of what hes do=
ing. 
 
Anyway check it out when you get a chance. I think if you can hear =
the evp at all that in quite a few you may hear the similarity in her voice=
, her way of speaking, and her tone. I dont expect you to hear all of it bu=
t I think most will hear quite a few of them.
