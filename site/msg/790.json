I&#39;m new here, though I know of some of you from other \nboards, IAH, Haunted Times, etc.\n\nI am Amy from Staten Island Paranormal Society.  I just got to meet \nChris Moon this weekend and got to experience &quot;Frank&#39;s box&quot;!  It was \namazing!  The box actually asked for me by name and told us about \npapers that are supposedly hidden in the house.  Frank, I just have \nto say, &quot;WOW&quot;!!  \n\nYesterday we went to try to find them, but the one floorboard we \nmanaged to get up didn&#39;t have any papers in it.  Because it is a \nhistorical location, we can&#39;t rip up the entire floor, though we&#39;d \nlove to! LOL!!\n\nHas anyone successfully been able to contact the people who came \nthrough on the box in another method, say through their digital \nrecorders?  I&#39;d like to try to get more specific instructions \nfrom &quot;Jonathan&quot; on where the papers may be.  The director seems to \nfeel strongly that these papers are really there.\n\nAmy\nStaten Island Paranormal Society"}
