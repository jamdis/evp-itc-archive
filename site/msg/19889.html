Well, for one thing, I do=
n't own the group anymore. Due to one of these incessent argurments, I had =
to back away from this some years ago as I almost got fired becuase yet som=
eone else that thought they knew so much more forwarded all my e-mails to m=
y boss. 

Then someone else seemed to be insinuating that I may have tamper=
ed with the imgaes. Very insulting. This stuff goes on an on, regardless of=
 the quality of voices, or the images. I have reached my saturation point. =
There seems to be nothing more to be gained by presenting anything else. No=
w, I can sympatize with Richard Roberts!

The group will continue, as there=
 are a number of box and paranormal experts here that are more than happy t=
o tell everyone what this stuff really is and how it works. 

I didn't mean=
 to create bad any feelings.

F-S
