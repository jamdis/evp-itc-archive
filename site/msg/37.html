Sometimes, they are willing to manipulate sound to form messages.  Remember=
 we are all energy, sound is also energy.  Energy is easy to manipulate.

F=
rank correct me if I'm wrong here.  I think Franks file that he sent was ma=
nipulated on the spot.  Mine is a bit different.  They some how saved up th=
e sound energy and used it at the end of the recording where no sound was p=
roduced from my computer speakers.  I like to think evp is formed from soun=
ds in our environment.  It is one of the main reasons why background sound =
such as white noise helps evp experimenters so much.

The way I got that ev=
p message was to play the german broadcast on my computer.  I had the volum=
e way down on my speakers, so it was just barely audible.  Because I have m=
y recorder on conference it still picked up the sound quite easily. I'm goi=
ng to take it off conference for the next session, because the messages com=
e through clearer that way.

I hope that helps

Jody

      Frank,
      your post reminded me of that method.  I lik=
e to use a broadcast from internet radio.

      Notice the man says "you n=
eed stop coming in and out like that" Bran was coming in and out of the hou=
se while I was recording.  Then the next voice is not even on the broadcast=
.  he says "perfect signal again" woo hoo!

Here's a voice from the 5th.


         This is one voice that was trying t=
o assert my identity. This was gotten by using a foreign  language as the r=
aw audio in 2002. The foreign language method is tuning in a non English st=
ation on short wave, I like French, German, and even Chinese. Then I announ=
ce I'm doing an EVP recording and record using the built in mic on a casset=
te deck.
