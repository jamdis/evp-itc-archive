I'm not trying to say I know how a spirit could 
        record on an analo=

sonable to assume it could directly change the bits on 
        digital med=

But, were I to 
        conjecture, o=
ne might say that the air pressure of a voice is converted 
        to a si=
gnal that modifies the magnetic properties of a tape.=C2=A0 And a 
        =
line recording uses a signal, not from the mic, but from some other 
      =
  source, to do the same.=C2=A0 So if that signal were to be manipulated 
 =
       via external EMF, it would change the final result on the tape.=C2=
=A0 
        

Since we are also assuming that digital recorders can pick u=

t signal 
        (before it gets digitized into bits) is also being manipu=
lated.=C2=A0 
        And an EMF source could theoretically manipulate both=
 the analog tape 
        signal, and the digital tape signal.

However, it=
 may be that an

                Your points seems to be that you can=
 make it 
                  work without knowing how it works.=C2=A0 So we =
need to talk 
                  about what you mean by that.

When you use =
the 
                  microphone, you just speak, and let the recorder do =
the 
                  rest.=C2=A0 In this case, you are using the recorder=
 without 
                  really knowing how it works. =C2=A0 If a spirit=
 can manipulate 
                  the EMF field around the AtoD converter =
(even without using 
                  the mic), then they should be able t=
o do the same: just use it 
                  without knowing how it works:=
 the recorder does the 
                  rest.=C2=A0 In neither case do ei=
ther of you need to know how 
                  it works, to get it to work=
. I am not questioning 
                  this.

But, if they are going to =
change the bits on the 
                  actual media themselves, then the=
y must know how it works, it 
                  order to get all those bit-=
things I mentioned right.=C2=A0 The 
                  recorder can't "do t=
he rest", because by changing the bits on 
                  the media them=
selves, they are going completely around what 
                  the record=
er does, and doing the details themselves.=C2=A0 And 
                  as =
I said, the details there are very technical, and include 
                =
  things like converting their words into digital samples of 
             =
     groups of a specific number of bits in a specific format on 
         =
         specific places in specific orders with other specific other 
    =
              bits connected to them like file ownership and dates and 
   =
               such.=C2=A0 It is the job, basically, of a computer, not a 
=
                  person.

If they are changing the bits on the media, 
   =
               then the recorder is not doing that.=C2=A0 They are no longe=
r 
                  letting the recorder "do it", like you or they would b=
e if 
                  they just used it normally.=C2=A0 The reason you ca=
n "make it 
                  work" without understanding it, is because th=
e recorder is 
                  doing the work for you.=C2=A0 If they are =
to change the media 
                  directly, then the recorder is no lo=
nger doing the work, and 
                  so they must understand all tho=
se digital issues.

So 
                  that is the difference between be=
ing able to use it without 
                  understanding it, and not bei=

                <td valign=3D"top">Your points seems to be that you c=
an make it 
                  work without knowing how it works.  So w=
e need to talk 
                  about what you mean by that.<br><br>When =
you use the 
                  microphone, you just speak, and let the reco=
rder do the 
                  rest.  In this case, you are using the =
recorder without 
                  really knowing how it works.   If =
a spirit can manipulate 
                  the EMF field around the AtoD co=
nverter (even without using 
                  the mic), then they should b=
e able to do the same: just use it 
                  without knowing how i=
t works: the recorder does the 
                  rest.  In neither ca=
se do either of you need to know how 
                  it works, to get it=
 to work. I am not questioning 
                  this.<br><br>But, if they=
 are going to change the bits on the 
                  actual media themse=
lves, then they must know how it works, it 
                  order to get =
all those bit-things I mentioned right.  The 
                  record=
er can't "do the rest", because by changing the bits on 
                  =
the media themselves, they are going completely around what 
              =
    the recorder does, and doing the details themselves.  And 
       =
           as I said, the details there are very technical, and include 
  =
                things like converting their words into digital samples of =

                  groups of a specific number of bits in a specific format=
 on 
                  specific places in specific orders with other specif=
ic other 
                  bits connected to them like file ownership and =
dates and 
                  such.  It is the job, basically, of a com=
puter, not a 
                  person.<br><br>If they are changing the bit=
s on the media, 
                  then the recorder is not doing that.&nbs=
p; They are no longer 
                  letting the recorder "do it", like=
 you or they would be if 
                  they just used it normally.&nbs=
p; The reason you can "make it 
                  work" without understandi=
ng it, is because the recorder is 
                  doing the work for you=
.  If they are to change the media 
                  directly, then t=
he recorder is no longer doing the work, and 
                  so they mus=
t understand all those digital issues.<br><br>So 
                  that is=
 the difference between being able to use it without 
                  und=
erstanding it, and not being able to use 
                  it.<br><br><br>=
