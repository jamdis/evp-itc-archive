Its a work in progress cuz right now Im digi \nrecorderless but Im using my mic hooked into my pc and the 12-470 \nsittin next to it...it was either not loud enuff to hear anything or \nthe 470 was way too loud and ya couldnt hear me at times lol. But Im \ngonna work on that for sure.  I did get some good responses tho and \ncould even hear them while I was recording and heard a cpl when i \nplayed it back...and if I can figure out how to clip them from the huge \nfile, on Goldwave, then I&#39;ll post them to here. \n\nIt took all my umph not to turn it on again and sit and listen and ask \nquestions...I think I may be one of those people who take this into the \ncloset to listen at night so I dont wake anyone hehehe\n\nI do have a question....which do you think is best...mp3 file or a wav \nfile?  \n\nThanks and Hope everyone had a wonderful Easter!\n\nRhonda"}
