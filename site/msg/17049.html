<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Have you considered that it may just be energy, and not a sentient being?

It sounds like a typical poltergeist case.

&gt; I am Annie. I have not written much but have visaully followed this group
&gt; over the past year. I have much experience in the realm of the paranormal.
&gt;
&gt; Here is the issue. Our home has an inhabitant that we cannot seem to
&gt; remove. It does not speak to us on the frank&#x27;s box nor will it communicate
&gt; through either me or my partner, Jay. We are both mediums. It slams and
&gt; bangs in the house almost ceaselessly at night. It hits the walls, windows,
&gt; the tv, the bedside tables and the doors. I am at a loss as to how to
&gt; otherwise communicate because as I said with the 2 boxes we have, it won&#x27;t
&gt; speak.
&gt;
&gt; I am open to any and all suggestions. We have told it to go, tried many
&gt; different suggested rituals and to no avail. It will go quiet for a day to
&gt; three days after ritual work but begins again, only louder.
&gt;
&gt; Please, if anyone can help or direct us to someone who can I would be most
&gt; grateful.
&gt;
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; Annie &amp; Jay C.
