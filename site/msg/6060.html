I understand what you are saying Ron. I know when I use the ST method that the scan rate is SOOOOOOOO fast that nothing coherent is allowed to bleed thru from any radio station. I dont allow it to lock onto any radio station. I dont usually pick up full words much less bits of sentences. Its all just babble noise they manipulate, phonetics they can play with. 
   
  Bearing that in mind some of the longest and most coherent replies have come from using the sweep tuning method (manually). Sometimes the sentences are so long I cant even name the files correctly LOL.
   
  I know for the 12-469 they were using a chip to increase the scan rate, but dont think they figured out that option for the others. Of course everyone could try out the manual ST and get a small radio with a turning dial they can rotate at a much faster rate.
   
  I have had live feedback during those sessions as well, even when its being scanned at such a fast rate out of the "babble" the voices form and carry over the entire sweep of the band in one coherent voice, parts of which can be heard live (sometimes).
   
  Its very easy, and simple to explore this method. No technical background needed. No building necessary. And thanks to Frank and Dave again for bringing it to the forefront of ideas in casual conversation. It works great!

the fear factor goes, if you don't like what you hear, and it really 
bothers you, then turn it off!

One potential problem with the existing hacks is that the scan rate 
is very slow and allows several full words to come through when 
passing over a station. Further, strong stations have more apparent 
bandwidth when received so complete phrases come through. While I 
have gotten some interesting results using slow scan on the MiniBox, 
my best results, as well as the preference of my users, tends to be 
a faster scan where a word or so at most comes through per station.

The faster scan allows the entities more 'randomized' raw material 
to work with so they can form their replies more coherently, and 
most important, more accurately.

If experimenters wish to spend their time using the Shack Hacks, 
then the scan rate must be increased or made variable in order to 
get the best results. While I have not inspected these radios in 
detail, I suspect the scan is generated digitally so it will require 
an external scan generator to create the appropriate rates.

Until more is known about who and what we are communicating with, 
this field will remain more an art than a science.
