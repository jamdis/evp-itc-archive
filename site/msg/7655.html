If you send the audio to me and tell me where the segment is, i will 
cut that part out and send it back to you.

&gt; Here is my problem. I have a digital recorder and it saves the 
files in WMA format. I tried saving the file in .wav, but it wont let 
me.  I have a 4 minute tape, but only need about 30 seconds of the 
tape as that is where I got my response. I am not very technical... 
This is frustrating as the EVP I got is really clear. i assume I can 
play the recorder and tape it again with sound recorder but then I 
lose clarity, I would imagine....  Does media player allow an edit of 
a file to take out x number of seconds and save to a .wav? have any 
ideas

&gt;   If you want to do a quick edit...you can do it using the sound 
recorder that comes with Windows. Just go to the start menu, all 
programs, accessories, entertainment, sound recorder....you can set 
the position of the marker to before the question and answer and 
delete the first part and then put the marker so its after and delete 
the rest...just make sure to save the new one u make separately from 
the .wav file otherwise you&#x27;ll lose the whole thing.  I would make a 
copy of the .wav and save it else where just to be safe.  That&#x27;s an 
option if ya don&#x27;t know which program you want to D/L yet.  You can 
do some pretty cool stuff using that recorder too, speed things up, 
slow em down, play em backwards, add echo, etc.  Pretty nifty for 
just a basic lil thing.

&gt;         I used my 12-469 for the first time this morning, and ran a 
4 minute tape session. One of the questions I asked was, &quot;When a 
person dies, do they see a white light?&quot;  After I asked this question 
the second time, I got a very distinct and crisp YES.  How can I save 
just that section of the file? Do I need to do that in the recorder, 
or can I do it in the .wave file I now have saved on my computer of 
the whole recording.
