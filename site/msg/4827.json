Being I am not professional at \ne.v.p.s but yet have gone through listening to many of them from \ntrustful resources, your e.v.p.s make me a bit leery. NOt trying to \nbe rude, so dont go get all upset right off the bat. In your e.v.p.s, \nthis one especially, alot of them sound like you, not the part where \nyou asking questions, but where your dad is supposively answering \nyou. NOw everyone has their own right to opinion so there is now need \nto get defensive, if all is real there would be nothing to get mad \nabout. I just cant help but notice how odd it is that your e.v.p. \nquestions to your father, seems to answer right away when you ask the \nquestion. Also, i notice that after you ask the question i hear \nsomething being turned on that has contains the answer to that \nquestion. Whether it be your dad or not. I feel its you that is \nanswering, but let me tell you why i figure this.. and please you \nwould like to defend you side of things that would be great, maybe i \nwould be able to change my opinion on the matter. But as of now, \ne.v.p.s are usually done on the same tape that the questions are on, \nthen in a rewind you can hear you and the e.v.p. but to me it sound \nlike you put the e.v.p. response on another tape. i am not trying to \nstart any kind of fight or be cruel, maybe i could learn something on \nbehalf of how you do your work... thank you"}
