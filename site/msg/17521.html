<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>After I got the bugs fixed and fired this this up ther was something
knocking onthe side of the garage, not just one spot, all over. Too high to
be one of the dogs, or a cat, and the wind wasn&#x27;t blowing. Not only that,
the garge is metal covered wiht woood siding, the whatever seemed to be
hitting the metal.

 As you can hear, lost of inbetween station or IF noise, that the main
reason I quit using car tuner. their advantage though it they can be used in
a metal enclosure.
