 THEIR scientific research on the study of EVP. The Windbridge Institute re=

                  <P>Frank, I think=
 you misunderstood or misread something 
                  somewhere. The A=
AEVP/Sarah Estep Research Fund is not for 
                  AAEVP to do th=
e research, it's for them to fund OUTSIDE 
                  organizations =
for THEIR scientific research on the study of 
                  EVP. The W=
indbridge Institute received some of this sponsor 
                  money =
for what they called "Real-time EVP Conversations: A 
                  Pil=
ot Study." The method for this communication was *not* 
                  b=
ased on radio sweep, nor traditional methods, so it's not 
                =
  based on what I assume many people here are doing. And in 
              =
    fact, it *was* based on the creations of someone outside of 
          =
        the USA, so I'm a little confused as to why all the hostility 
    =
              toward AAEVP for putting up the money.<BR><BR>Sadly, radio 
 =
                 sweep methods don't, and may not for a long time, get the =

                  respect of the scientific community that it deserves (th=
en 
                  again, seems no form of EVP does), but at least this =
current 
                  research is a step in the right direction. I hop=
e, when 
                  Windbridge concludes their study, that it will s=
upport the 
                  notion that there is apparent communication f=
ormed in ways 
                  that cannot be explained by currently know=
n and understood 
                  laws of nature. THAT alone, in my opini=
on, would be a big plus 
                  for all ITC communities, regardl=
ess of the method from which 
                  that communication was rece=
ived. What's the old saying? "It 
                  takes but one white cro=
w to prove all crows are not black." 
                  Any proof, derived =
from any EVP method, would be greatly 
                  welcomed as far as=
 I'm concerned.<BR><BR>Margaret </P>
