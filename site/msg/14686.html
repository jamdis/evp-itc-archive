Yes.=A0 Also faulty wiring, which is eve=

Also with flakey transformers or other power distribution=

Perhaps you can check with some neighbors, an=

Hi All,
=A0
Is there someone here that can answer and electri=
cal question for me?
=A0
During the case that I recorded those possible EVP=
's-there was a loud tapping noise that seemed to come from the 2nd bedroom.=
 Upon checking my logs, every time one of=A0 these clicks were heard, there=
 would be an EMF spike in the livingroom. The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the =
livingroom downstairs. The home owners have also reported that they have a =
touch lamp that comes on all the time by itself and the lights in the Kitch=
en will dim occasionally.
=A0
Now these taps are not consistent in timing, =
loudness or rhythm. Could this be the work of faulty breakers?
=A0
Thanks!
