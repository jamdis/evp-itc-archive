Maybe something's wrong with the recordings or for some reason they just  
aren't picking up what that person is hearing, because I was not able to hear 
 anything either, that why I asked about the one with the 1927 year it in, 
but I  didn't hear anything. sf

James, Unfortunately I didn't hear what  you are hearing in these either. 
My results are pretty much the same as Ricks.  In a few instances, I could 
hear something, but not sure what it was, not even  sure if it was a voice or 
just a noise or artifact from too much  "enhancing".
 
I am not going to say that you definitely  don't have anything in your 
recordings, but I can't say you have anything  either.

I opened your folder and examined all your files.

Here are my  opinions (I have truncated the file names due to laziness):

ahh_mmm  noises, no speech
call_us noises, no speech
cal_us (enhanced) several  listenings: pixelated, no speech
compare_panasonic noises, no  speech
compare_sony noises, no speech
first_epv noises, no  speech
good_whistle noises, no speech (maybe feedback)
hey_can noises,  no speech
hey_whats noises, no speech
I_hit noises, no  speech
important_date noises, no speech
keep_moving several  listenings: Hellalal see woobeh 
laugh_evp noises, no speech
lets_wait  several listenings: noises, no speech
maybe_gun noises, no  speech
miss_you noises, no speech
my_question several listenings: no  da lee
oh_ noises, no speech
something several listenings: noises, no  speech
that_mans noises, no speech
that's_jim noises, no  speech
this_one several listenings: noises, no speech
tomorrow noises,  no speech

The ones that took several listenings I thought I might  hear words in, so 
I examined those several times. Sometimes I could sort of  hear something 
that sort of sounded like what you suggested, but I could  also hear it in 
other ways, or not at all.

So my suggestion to you,  if you want to get less subjective conjuctures or 
simply less affirmations  of your own interpretations, is to post the 
future ones without labels. The  labels you give can influence the listeners: 
when you have a sound that  could be several things, and you note that it 
sounded like "keep it moving",  the listener can find it nearly impossible to try 
NOT to hear what you  heard, and so not be able to give a fresh perspecive 
to help your research  methods.
