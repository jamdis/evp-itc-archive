<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rees.  I think the most important thing is that the USE CUE LIST option be checked.  I 
like a little higher tone of voice, so I have my speed set at 106%.  And I have checked the 
box for play EVP &#x27;continuously.&#x27;

When I listen back, if I want to slow the words a bit to increase clarity, I decrease the 
tempo by about -18.  Changing the tempo (rather than the speed) will slow the rate of 
speech without changing the pitch of the voice.  Decreasing speed will change both the 
rate of speech and lower the pitch of the voice.

&gt; Hey guys  I am wondering how has the research been working with the 
&gt; EVPMaker, and what is the different settings that everybody has been 
&gt; using to get the best results?
&gt; 
&gt; Myself, I haven&#x27;t had too much luck with it, but I&#x27;m still working with 
&gt; it. I haven&#x27;t use it but 3 times. I know some people here has been 
&gt; getting great results, and I was wandering if they could post their 
&gt; settings they have been using to get these results.  Please share the 
&gt; knowledge!
