I wonder if you could pcik up on the energy they supposedly focused on the 
box? That&#x27;s something I&#x27;m skeptical about, as the box builder. I don&#x27;t think 
it&#x27;s needed. When I do my sessions I ask no questions, and don&#x27;t ask for any 
particular spirit. I like to leave it open, and all enetities are welcome. I 
don&#x27;t want to set up expectations, or limitations, but..that&#x27;s only my way 
of running it.

Did you hear anything out of the box?

&gt;Hi To All
&gt;I have been listening to every posted file, and there are several that are 
&gt;so distinct. This one is one of them! Very nice, very interesting, 
&gt;definatley something happening! I am fixin to get my own and start as well. 
&gt;I got to witness the box belonging to Bill Murphy at a Paranormal Meetup 
&gt;group. This was the first time I had seen such a thing and to be honest at 
&gt;first was a bit skeptical, even though I strongly believe and feel have 
&gt;collected much credible evidence of paranormal activity for many years now. 
&gt;I have come to conclude that I am extremely sensitive to energies as well 
&gt;as extremely intuitive. The box has a definate energy about it. I continue 
&gt;to read everything thats posted and listen in hope to grasp this whole 
&gt;concept. I cant get it out of my mind. How amazing this form of EVP is. 
&gt;Good job to all, hopefully I will be able to contribute some time soon. You 
&gt;know years ago my kids had Furbies (sp?), and they would just start talking 
&gt;out of no
&gt;  where and say very revelent things that I felt was strange at the time 
&gt;and out of context to anything my kids said....LOL, I wonder if there is 
&gt;any connection. Maybe not but I never forget them, Frank&#x27;s Box conjures up 
&gt;the same energy to me.
