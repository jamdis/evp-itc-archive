On your FM 
at second 10-12 I hear "telephone" and a fainter "he=
llo?" I've gotten one or two "telephone-hello" voices myself. Very interest=
ing. 

at about second 18 "you're/its so beautiful" a high soft female voic=
e, I've gotten this message before and have also noticed it on others' file=
s too. These along with the "I love you"s are a good sign to hear, it means=
 whoever is on the other side is feeling happy right now.

around sec 33-35=
 a man says quickly "I've paid a bit cause of you"

sec 42-43 "wait, just c=
ome" harmonic/singing higher pitch

sec 44-45 "the people are talking to me=
" also harmonic/singing higher pitch, I think in response to the message at=
 sec 42-43

sec 46-48 "you must do it"

sec 49-51 "did you say do that?" an=
other high synth voice

at 1:02 there's the "I love you" :)

there are so m=
any more communications just on your FM sample, but some are too quick/blur=
ry to decipher quickly, but there are definitely way many more!

AM sample:=


wow, I hear so much am not sure what's communication and what's just radi=
o, I'm also not used to listening to am... what's the sweep speed, will it =
be possible for any full words to come through at all? If not, then you've =
got a heck of a lot of stuff going on... I heard something about obama twic=
e and have only listened through about half of it.
