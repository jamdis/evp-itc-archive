                It sounds like a tricky situation, and I'm not sure wh=
at to suggest. I suppose one route is to, as you suggest, just walk away fr=
om all this.  I guess you have to look at the big picture and decide if it'=
s worth the frustration, the stress, and the angst, especially what it does=
 to your health.  Nothing is worth throwing your health away over.  

     =
           Even dropping all this, just for a while, might also tell you if=
 any health problems you are experiencing might be being aggravated by all =
the drama.  And it might have the side effect of letting all the negativity=
 and egos out there burn themselves out, so if you do look back into things=
 a while down the road, it could be a prettier picture then.

             =
   Other than a full retreat, I don't think anything else would make a diff=

andards for evaluation and test of the technology and results, which the sh=

them, and eventually, hopefully, be embarrassed back into obscurity.

                            Thanks Rick! You seem to have put=
 alot of thought and time into that. 

                             What re=
ally bothers me is the self proclaimed experts out there that take all evid=
ence and experience and try to make it negative, and evil. Maybe many get t=

  =
                           I don't do ghost hunts or invesitgations, but th=
e hauntings I've heard of seem to be nothing more than something trying to =
get someone's attention. It's these experts that turn it into something tha=
t must be negative.  There's Hollywood, such as the "Haunting In CT", these=
 same experts will proclaim is based on fact, when the facts are probably n=
othing more than your creaking floors, just to make the whole paranoramal f=
ield dark and demon filled. In my case, fear does not sell, I won' watch th=
ose movies. 

                             I think there is good EVP eviden=
ce, and I've heard many from various researchers.  Trouble is, it's like ta=
lking on a phone or radio, how do you know who it is other by what they say=

    That is an interesting observation. I think the core of the issue is th=
at there seems to be a `sweet spot' in paranormal beliefs where there is ju=
st enough science, just enough technical backing, just enough paranormal cl=
aims, and just enough indefinite evidence that keeps people interested in t=
he ghost hunting mentality

                              Evidence which be=
comes too indefinite turns off most people. As they become more aware of se=
nsitives who simply make claims ("I feel there is a GHOST here!"), but prov=
ide no evidence other than statements, people eventually get bored. Similar=
ly, people eventually grow tired of the anthropomorphism of every little oc=
currence in a house: a creak implies a footstep, which implies a person, wh=
ich, if not seen, implies a ghost. But a creak does not equal a footstep.

=
                              And while this kind of indefinite evidence ca=
n lose an audience, so can evidence that is claimed to be "obviously" evide=
nt by technology. Here, the investigator is no longer making vague claims, =
but waving science around, like FLIR cameras, or EMF meters, and then makin=
g proclamations of the results. But again, people eventually see these are =
just lights and sounds from electronics, and investigators making more clai=
ms. It's like the psychics again, but with visual aids.

                  =
            I think the reason EVP studies are not securing more interest, =
as you noted, are a little of both effects. First is the anthropomorphism p=
roblem: I notice many EVP experimenters proclaim what their results sound l=
ike, or name the sound file by what they've heard. But like the creaks, "so=
unds like" does not equal "is". This is then compounded by the technology b=
acking: regardless of how valid the EVP researcher's results are, the techn=
ology can seem intimidating, but the researchers often proclaim the obvious=
ness of their results. People again become turned off by it because it is n=
ot obvious to them, and in the end it is just another piece of technology p=
resenting sounds, with no obvious connection to the paranormal, except by t=
he claims and interpretations of the presenters.

                         =
     I believe, taking these issues into account, there is a way for EVP st=
udies to garner more interest. For now, the analysis coming from the resear=
chers usually seems like a claim, and it is these claims, imho, that is bei=
ng classified by the public with the rest of the paranormal claims, and so,=
 it also becomes less of an interest. A new approach could be one without t=
he claims and interpretations of the investigators, one where the sounds ar=
e simply played and not labeled. The interpretation of the data could be le=
ft to the listeners. Web sites which present EVPs could be developed where =
people could not see others interpretations until they entered their own. I=
 think this would be such a novel approach, that it would give the public a=
 better feeling of true involvement in the research, and feel less like the=
y are simply being exposed to the claims of others. And I think that feelin=
g of involvement is what is needed to reignited the public interest here.
