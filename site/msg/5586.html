Here's what i got from the 2min. one  Traditional EVP is a bit rough  for me, 
but at the end i believe it says "Al give it to Patti".  I slowed  it up and 
raised the volume a bit.

Hello all, I am new to the group and I have uploaded an EVP file I made  
with my new Digital Voice recorder in my bedroom this morning. I had a  
really kick butt one that I sent to TAPs. A little girl, clear as a  
bell but there was nothing I could do with it. Hopefully TAPs can do  
something with it.

Now, the file I put up, if you listen REALLY  close when I ask a 
question there are tiny bell sounds right after the  question. I have 
another almost 10 minute EVP where I left the recorder in  the room, no 
windows or doors open and when I went in to turn it off there  was a 
very strong scent of old fashioned tea rose.

If anyone could  bump up the 2nd one to see what the low voices are 
saying that would be  great, drop me an e-mail. I am a sensitive but 
would love to learn how to  also use some equiptment to help me out.

Thank you  

Saqqara
