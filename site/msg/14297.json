Although, I could not hear the tape for some reason as it did  not come \nthrough, and I am having problems with Gold Wave so, I can&#39;t filter out  the \nstatic,  I have to learn how to operate these other  kind of  recording \nsoftware devices. My mother was born in 1927, and her voice was  really light, \nthat&#39;s one thing our family has in common, the women all seem to  have the \nsame type of voice, my daughter sounds, like me, my cousin sounds like  my \ndaughter, my mother, grandmother, aunt, we kind of sound much the  same in \ntone and vocalization.  If I could hear that file, I would  know her voice.  \nIt&#39;s probably because of the ancestors, my grandmother who  was Ransom married \na Stebbins, then 100 years before that the geneology  show&#39;s a Stebbins \nmarried to a Ransom, and this goes back, plus A Ward/Ransom  cross was there, \nand a Stuart/Stebbins, cross, and a Stuart/Clark, so over  the years this \nvoice type or sound was kind of some how got ingrained.  I  am wondering if the \n1927 was my mom, her voice was very light, and that year was  very \nimportant to her, because when she was little she as a baby crawed out on a  pier, \nat a place back then called the &quot;devils wash bowl&quot; it was where my great,  \ngreat grandfather, a Ransom lived in Old Misson, MI he had collie  dogs, and \nhad a big male called Tasso, when mom as a baby fell in this very deep  water \nhe jumped in and pulled her to shore, don&#39;t know how she managed to get  \nout on that pier in the first place, but she would have drowned if not for \nthat  dog.  So, September 4,1927 was/is her birth day, and in 1928  she almost \ndrowned, at about 10 or 11 months old.sf\n \n \nIn a message dated 5/15/2009 10:58:23 A.M.
