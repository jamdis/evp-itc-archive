Hello Everyone,

I have recently started doing EVP/ITC research.

I am usin=
g a regular cassette tape recorder for now. It has a built in microphone.

=
So far I have gotten two different voices. 

Both of them are easily heard =
without the headphones on my tape recorder.

Before I start recording I alw=
ays say a prayer of protection and ask if any one wants to communicate with=
 me, but that they must come in love, light and peace, etc.

The first voic=
e that I received was a male voice that said "Peace."

The second voice tha=
t I received was a female voice. I had asked if there were any Spirits here=
 that would like to talk to me. She said, "No, no Spirits." Then someone wa=
lking, (I presume her) with very audible footsteps with heels are heard. 

=
My thoughts are that maybe she isn't aware that she has died or that she is=
 an Angelic presence of some sort that never took birth. 

I don't know if =
anyone has read Mark Macy's book "Miracles In The Storm", but it is great. =
I also enjoyed Sara Estep's book "Voices Of Eternity", which is available f=
ree online. http://aaevp.com/voices_of_eternity_web.pdf

Blessings ALL,

Je=
remy Robert Huber
