I respond to the daily digests. Sorry if \nthere is trouble following my posts. I don&#39;t intend to cause \nconfusion, just learn and share what I know. I was under the \nimpression it was an EVP/ITC discussion group, and am merely trying \nto participate as I can. My appologies if it gets confusing.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, don powell &lt;dpowell7299@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; David,\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the 3rd email of yours that I have no clue what you are \ntalkign about.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is laudable that you cut out the extra stuff but leave enough \nfor us to figure out which email you are answering :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Don\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: David Rountree &lt;ghost_hunter_01@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Monday, November 10, 2008 7:07:02 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re:Re : [EVP-ITC] Ghost Box in a Faraday Cage type \nenclosure\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; You realize of course what \n&gt; that indicated don&#39;t you?\n&gt;  \n&gt; David M.
