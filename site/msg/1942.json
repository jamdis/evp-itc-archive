For everyone here that follows your work \n&gt;it&#39;s exciting to watch where this is going. Question, is there a manual \n&gt;over ride so the linear tune function be parked on a station? I know this \n&gt;isn&#39;t the purpose but it could be a plus. -Bill\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:                            \n&gt;    This is the latest printed board I just now ordered. If anyone wants to \n&gt;see\n&gt;  it you have to download the PCBExpress software at www.PCBexpress.com. \n&gt;The\n&gt;  silk screen markings are for assembly purposes, and won&#39;t be on this \n&gt;order,\n&gt;  so I didn&#39;t care if there was some over lap. There&#39;s no way to mark the\n&gt;  layout underside components, but I have my notes for that. All components\n&gt;  are from mouser.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Even though the layout is labled &quot;RVG&quot;, it is in fact linear and random, \n&gt;AM\n&gt;  and FM, with stereo input and output (except for the monitor speaker). \n&gt;There\n&gt;  is provision for both wire, and bar antennas. The board was made extra\n&gt;  copmpact to reduce cost, I wanted to keep the two boards under $100, the\n&gt;  cost was about $93. With silk screen and solder mask, they would have \n&gt;been\n&gt;  double.\n&gt;\n&gt;  After endless hours staring at the screen, my eys are about fried, I have \n&gt;a\n&gt;  spot in the right eye, that hopefully will clear up.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Butttttt Boring Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;  __________________________________________________________\n&gt;  More photos, more messages, more storage���get 2GB with Windows Live \n&gt;Hotmail.\n&gt;  \n&gt;http://imagine-windowslive.com/hotmail/?locale=en-us&ocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_mini_2G_0507\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nNow you can see trouble���before he arrives \nhttp://newlivehotmail.com/?ocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_viral_protection_0507"}
