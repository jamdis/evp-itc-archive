I&#39;m like you; I try to \nmake things and make them work, However I am no electronics \nwiz...gosh, I wish I was. The ideas &quot;they give me I don&#39;t understand \nthat I have in my head! &quot;Them calling me princess was kind&quot; and yes \npurple women don&#39;t smoke...I am trying to quit and they have offered \nto help me. Im doing pretty good 4 to 8 cigs a day. Otherwise I am \nhyper as heck.\nI stumbled on to something in thought...maybe from &quot;them&quot; I live in \nMexico about a good 4 hours south of the boarder. Now, all my evps or \ndrv are in Ingles!!(English) can you believe that! I speak no spanish \nunless I have spanish guests with me then they do! I am willing to \ncontribute a good size sum of money for &quot;resources&quot; as I am blessed \nwith means to do so. Please email me privately as I would like to \npurchase a protype box from you and help encourage you to continue \nyour experiments and possibly in another country and see what the \nresults are, What do you think?\nI also stumbled onto something...I cannot explain...but there is no \nstatic or noise in the background like your sweep method except I do \nhave to clean it. I will most definitly post these files tomorrow.\nWe recived a very unsual name &quot;Germam I think: Called Ocurazck...well \nmy husband found it on ancestry and someone posted a sad story about \nher brother commiting sucide 1 yr ago...she misses him dearley/ also \nrecieveied info regarding the planet Saturn versus Earth. I sent \nFrank R some of these files and he can verify them, but, of course we \nall hear so differently. I use no head phones! I want to hear clear \nvoices as precise as possible.\nSo, as Frank R. mentioned about integerity, I am willing to donate \n300 dollars for a box just to experiment with here in another \ncountry...and will send it back to per your request when you desire. \nPlease consider this. This is south of the North Americas and a great \nopportunity to see what we can achieve. \nPlease let me know your thoughts on this.\nLaura\nPS btw I record with Misty and Frank and others every wednesday \nnight. were also looking to expand here in Mexico!!\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Another from last night, this was using linear sweep. I like this \nmethod so \n&gt; much I might drop the random circuit from future boxes. I stayed up \nlast \n&gt; night to add the linear sweep function to an old box.\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s no way I can stop making boxes, I just don&#39;t have the \nresuources to \n&gt; supply them to everyone that wants at this time, plus trying ot \nfind waay to \n&gt; make the things more better. I am no engineer, and it takes a while \nto \n&gt; figure things out--as with all aspects of this life.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Local listings, incredible imagery, and driving directions - all in \none \n&gt; place! http://maps.live.com/?wip=69&FORM=MGAC01\n&gt;"}
