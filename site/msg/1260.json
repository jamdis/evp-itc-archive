It&#39;s totally free software and is popular with those who wish \nto record and analyze EVPs. It&#39;s got the noise reduction features that \nsome find useful when wishing to reduce 60 Hz hum.\n\nRegards, Bill Murphy\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David Hogan&quot; &lt;hoodoodave54@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  I have been recording evp&#39;s for over 3 years now and I think I have \n&gt; heard it all, from a little girl that was raped &quot; tore my cloths \n&gt; off&quot;, &quot;I was very scared&quot; then &quot; I died in the snow&quot; to the same \nvoice \n&gt; that cusses me out every time I record. Now Im looking for a free or \n&gt; very cheap audio program to help clean the recordings up to make them \n&gt; clearer. any suggestions? thanks.\n&gt;"}
