Yeah more portable these days =) 
   
  I get the videos fine but playin them is not quite so easy. For some reason i get 1 sec audio then it is silence for rest of the recording. Not sure why. I even tried converting to another format and same thing. Is the sound working for you guys?

   This is the first box I used the 469 in. It's not set up for "hack mode", and it uses only the AA-8 packs as power. I attempted top put a video on You Tube , but ran into some problems, and I had to get to work, so don't know if that uploaded.
