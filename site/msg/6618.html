Steve,
 
You and I  have never really agreed on what constitutes a good fi=
le.
I would say besides the ones that say a simple yes or no, I don't hear =
any of yours either.
thats kind of funny. Maybe they want it that way? (no =
disrespect) We have had our differences 
but that aside I consider you an e=
xcellent researcher and value your profesional opinion.
 
So please if we c=
an comment objectively on each others files and not let personal crap get i=
n the way.
By all means.
 
Bruce

I like the p=
ersonal audio clips too. However, the fact is for those who don't check the=
ir e-mail all day long and when they get home they have 80 e-mails and 50 o=
f them are just announcements to files. I do listen to them also and enjoy =
it, but maybe we can limit the files to a few instead of a lot at one time.=
 It also seems like the board freed up a lot of space as well, so people ca=
n start posting on this board again. The e-snips thing is cool, but it's be=
tter all on the same board and i think the space is available now to do tha=
t. I personally listened to all your posts Bruce and so did a lot of others=
 i'm sure. Maybe there wasn't a lot in that batch to comment on for people.=
 Some you hear and some you don't, i personally don't hear a lot of what yo=
u post with no disrespect. Do you want 200 people responding "I didn't hear=
 that" to some of the files or "Yeah Good One". I can make out other files =
only if you label them and i'm waiting for the file to say that and i think=
 you proved that with your experiment with unlabeled files that no one got =
the right answer to. The fact is people hear different things all the time.=
Your files sound very much like traditional EVP and are hard to make out so=
metimes, but sometimes you hit on some good ones too. You have stated in a =
personal e-mail to not respond to any of your files, and i've honored your =
request but if you allow me to comment on the files you post i will. It see=
ms there are only a couple that respond to files here, but i'm sure others =
listen as well and don't comment. I will be more than happy to add to to th=
e group discussions on your files, but the couple people that always respon=
d to your files have nothing but praise and i disagree sometimes.-Steve H. =
