I&#x27;m so busy withe boxes, I haven&#x27;t had much time to mess with extra stuff. I 
just ordered some new chips last night so I can add FM as an additional 
sound source.

There&#x27;s a lot of darkside interaction, and if you start getting a workable 
system up and running you get those voices that try to either scare you off, 
or distract you from the real stuff. The darkheads don&#x27;t want this stuff to 
work, preferring humans stay in fear, and fear of death is the most powerful 
fear to have. The manipulations can be very subtle. I don&#x27;t want to get 
distracted on other systems till I have a PCB made, and a production system 
out there.
I have an idea for a Spiricom like device using audio tones, instead of 
using radio as a sound source, I think I can adapt my system to it,  using 
the random vlotage gnerator to sweep an audio VCO using the Intersil 8038 
chip.  This voice was using a tone generator I had built into one of the 
receivers years ago, and mixed it with the radio noise.You can hear the 1000 
hz sqaurewave tone in the background.
