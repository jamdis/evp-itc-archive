The more you do it, the deeper you\n&gt; go, the more developed you get in general.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rosemary\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ecuyler&quot; &lt;ecuyler@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have a question for those of you who have been doing this research\n&gt; &gt; for a while.  Since doing the research, have you noticed an increase\n&gt; &gt; in your &quot;intuitive&quot; senses?  By that I mean, has your hearing been\n&gt; &gt; heightened to the point of hearing conversations when you are alone? \n&gt; &gt; Or seeing things more clearly spirit wise?  Or am I just nuts and need\n&gt; &gt; to be committed?  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I had to ask.  It&#39;s a very strange thing.  These things have been\n&gt; &gt; happening to me and I&#39;m wondering if you have experienced the same\n&gt; &gt; thing or close to it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jeremy\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
