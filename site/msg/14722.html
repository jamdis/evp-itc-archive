No this was a constant recording. This was caught in an empty room on my ca=
mcorder footage, as well as on some other recording devices. 

That coupled=
 with the EMF spikes at the same time confirm that it was in the house, not=
 in the machinery. If it is a static discharge, something is still causing =
it. But it doesn't sound like a static discharge. I say tap, but it is more=
 of a sharp pop.  I am attaching a clip of the sound if you want to hear it=
.

This went on constantly throughout the entire time we were there, about =
4 hours.

        It could: if you've ever noticed the tap sou=
nd when starting or stopping a recording session, assuming it is not being =
caused by pushing a switch in the mic, the tap or pop you hear can be cause=
d by the electronics as it begins to ceases recording.

        Also a stat=
ic charge can cause the pop.

          Thanks! Would that account for=

                  Yes.  Also faulty wiring, which is even more dange=
rous.
                  Also with flakey transformers or other power distri=
bution in the area, or power lines.
                  Perhaps you can check=
 with some neighbors, and see how their power is doing.

  Hi All,

                    Is there someone here that can answer and el=
ectrical question for me?

                    During the case that I recor=
ded those possible EVP's-there was a loud tapping noise that seemed to come=
 from the 2nd bedroom. Upon checking my logs, every time one of  these clic=
ks were heard, there would be an EMF spike in the livingroom. The 2nd bedro=
om is upstairs, the livingroom downstairs. The home owners have also report=
ed that they have a touch lamp that comes on all the time by itself and the=
 lights in the Kitchen will dim occasionally.

                    Now thes=
e taps are not consistent in timing, loudness or rhythm. Could this be the =
work of faulty breakers?

                    Thanks!
                    A=
pril
