Oh, this is so interesting! Email is such a difficult medium through
which to communicate, never mind EVP or ITC!! (No pun intended on the
"medium" part... oh, ok, if it works, let it go!) <ggg> 

I find David's posts interesting and helpful in terms of things to
think about regarding what "validation" might be useful in analyzing
the "how" of these phenomena. Ok, so I don't always like what I
interpret as his tone of voice, but that's the difficulty about
email... we can't hear his tone of voice, nor do we have any sense of
how he is speaking when he writes his emails. I know in my business
consulting, I have to be meticulous to NOT write anything that can be
misinterpreted due to lack of tone of voice. People write things that
they think are not inflammatory, and others read them as totally
hostile... we all know this happens!

Personally, I have experienced coherent voices coming through a simple
recorder (a cassette tape at that, years ago), but I have not been
experimenting myself lately, though I would like to make the time to
do so. I have concerns about the stray signals that a device that
sweeps the am and/or fm and/or cb bands might generate, and so if I
were doing my experiments now, I'd likely NOT use a box or a hacked radio.

But: that does not mean I intend to invalidate anyone else's work. I
love knowing what others here are reporting, and listening to the
occasional voice file (I get the digest so I don't get the files
attached). I am delighted when "messages" come through. The sheer
number of coherent hits with this suggests to me that at least some of
these phenomena are genuine, if not many of them.

I for one appreciate David's thinking and analyses, and am inclined to
think similarly to him, and I for one hope he continues to contribute
here, though I do suggest to you, David, that you maybe try to
moderate your email tone of voice <g>. The more opinions and
conversations we have here on this list about ALL the possibilities in
this fascinating area of research, the better... and that's my two
cents! <G>

Cheers,

Leslie
