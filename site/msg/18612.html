I expect none of us like all the recent attacks, insults, =
 accusations, 
threats, hurting of feelings, and attempts to piss people  o=
ff. 

Can I suggest we stick to the purpose of the group: "the  discussion,=
 
promotion, and developemnt of Electronic Voice Phenomenon,  and Instrumen=
tal 
Transcommunication methods and technologies as used  in the communicat=
ion with 
spirit, and other entities."

And that  we go with Frank's philos=
ophy "just take the approach, try 
different  methods, see what works."

No=
 more threats. No name calling,  insults, or accusations. Just try to 
keep=
 a positive group attitude,  be open that not everyone believes what 
every=
one else does, and that's  ok?
