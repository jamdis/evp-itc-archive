Hi Steve, hope all is well with you.
   
  From this site it appears that yourself, Frank, Bruce, and Kristin and others I can not think of at the moment, have been engaged in contact as such that you ask a question and they give an answer. Have any of you ever taken the info you receive from lets say one spirit and tried to contact their living relative to give them a copy of the recording? Have spirits asked you more experienced researchers to do that, and if so, was the person you contacted indeed the correct loved one, and what was their response in you contacting them?  I think this would be awesome to be able to serve as a messenger to the deceased
