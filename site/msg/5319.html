<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Juli,

Thanks for your input -- this is interesting -- could it be that Mike 
and Lisa use these fragments in conjunction with psycho-kinesis in 
order to modify the tone of these fragments to sound as their own 
voices would have sounded when they were alive?  We know they don&#x27;t 
have vocal cords, and so they probably communicate via some kind of 
thought/mind process ...  Not to say that all the entities employ 
this method, maybe some of the more identifiable ones like Mike and 
Lisa.

I love mulling over things and this will keep me mulling for quite a 
long time.

&gt; Bruce, you may want to also add that when they wait for those 
fragments they are in fact Mike and Lisa&#x27;s voice not just any male or 
female voice.  They are ones that you identify as being theirs.

&gt; &gt; Sharon,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In my experience through research, most of the time mike will 
wait 
&gt; for a masculine fragment or signal
&gt; &gt; and lisa will wait for a feminine one. I believe they try to 
answer 
&gt; in the apropriate gender so that I 
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t get confused about who is answering. Sometimes I will get a 
&gt; response or message that is made 
&gt; &gt; up of both male and female voices together, even in the same word 
&gt; sometimes but very rarely.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And I think when that occurs it&#x27;s because they lose the 
particular 
&gt; fragment midstream and pick up 
&gt; &gt; whatever is available at that instant to complete the message , 
&gt; word or phrase.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I hope this answers your question and please keep asking them. It 
&gt; forces me to formulate an answer
&gt; &gt; and you to further your knowledge as a researcher. That&#x27;s what 
it&#x27;s 
&gt; all about.

&gt; response?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Bruce,Is it common to receive a response comprised of a mixture 
of 
&gt; men and women sound bytes/voices (like I heard in this one)? My 
guess 
&gt; is that we hear predominantly male voices because they&#x27;re more male 
&gt; radio announcers. Therefore, does the entity who announces herself 
to 
&gt; you as Lisa come through with a male voice at times (because those 
&gt; are the voices that she gets most of the time to formulate a 
&gt; response)? Please tell me if my reasoning here is way off 
&gt; base...Thanks,Sharon--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-
