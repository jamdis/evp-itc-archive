<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>LOL Bruce.  Isn&#x27;t that the truth!?!  (re: riddles, and no straight forward answers).  Good 
thing so many of us are persistent.  :-)

&gt; william,
&gt;  
&gt; Right now we are trying to get the answers to this and many other questions.
&gt; We have been getting a reference to air people that started with the use of the 
&gt; evp maker and allaphone file. I personally have never recieved any messages with this 
reference before 
&gt; evp maker.
&gt;  
&gt; It is an ongoing frustration in this research, whatever method we use. To get a straight 
foeward answer from our friends
&gt; on the other side. Beside yes and no or general answers, any message or answer that 
entails elaboration is sent
&gt; in the form of a riddle or the content is left open to wide interpritation.
&gt;  
&gt; I am doing more experimental sessions with evp maker and am trying to find out the 
meaning of &quot;air people&quot; as well as other answers.
&gt; when and if I ever get anything definitive, of course it will be posted. Heck even the 
vague stuff and the nonsense will be posted.
&gt;  
&gt; Stay tuned for further information 
&gt;
