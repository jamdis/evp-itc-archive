So, stock up on canned food if you can guys, enough to last for \n&gt; at  least a year or 2, I buy mine a few extra at a time, and if you are \n&gt; translated  over, the food will be there for some one else that gets stuck here \n&gt; for that  near 3 years.  I keep hoping to win the lotto, like everyone else, \n&gt; then I  would put lots of food in here for people so, they don&#39;t starve.   I \n&gt; have  the lake down here, our water is from a natural artesian spring \n&gt; water, it is 250  feet deep so, it&#39;s pretty safe to drink.  And even if I lost \n&gt; electricity,  one could always get some water, from the lake out there which \n&gt; is private  too.  If I leave, anyone stuck here is welcome to come over here \n&gt; to live,  but you will need to probably keep up with the mortgage if there \n&gt; is still the  bank left.  Whatever, it&#39;s going to be pretty bad from what I \n&gt; hear.  sf\n&gt;"}
