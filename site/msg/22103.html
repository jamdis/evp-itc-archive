<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>1-Calling an Edison box is sham and scam. A way of trying to lend credbility to it, and remove me from box history, and it does look suspicioulsy like what I make. It is also ignoring all EVI-ITC history of the last one hundred years. How many here realize the ghost box, or radio sweep method used to be called Direct Radio Voice, and has long history? I have never heard any stories of Edison getting radio contacts wioht spirit.
 How many have even done five minutes of research on the history of EVP. I can tell ya, none! No, y&#x27;all want to sit in the dark and ask what color your shirt is then claim to be great researchers and experts. 

 2-I doubt that it truely random, I&#x27;d like to see a scope vid of the sweep modes. 

 I wouldn&#x27;t have problem, but these people like the one putting on this video belittle and insult me in public. For what? For their own fame and fortune. Then try to copy Chirs Moon, and blame the concept on Edison--freaking clueless, all of you!

&gt; This video explains all the features of the box.  So, get some popcorn and enjoy.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the first box to have shack hack modes as well as linear and random adjustable sweeps.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, the only box other than the &quot;Minibox&quot; to have a working random circuit in it.
