this is one where some in lower plains are wanting to go into the light,  
where they say "we want to return" but a group they ask to save them, say, 
"we  want to" but "he will not save you"  I think they are trying to make them 
 stay in the lower realms, but JC will save!  He will not listen them,  
that's why we are asked to pray for them, He will hear us, so we help those  
people get out of darkness with our prayers.  One need not be fancy with  
pray, just ask God, through Jesus to help them.  sf
