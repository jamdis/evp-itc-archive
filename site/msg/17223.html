Frank, try not to be so defensive when someone disagrees with you.

Not all=
 alternate opinions are 'debunking". Discussion, different processes, diffe=
rent viewpoints, all add to research.=C2=A0 Everyone marching to the same t=
une, and all agreeing, doesn't.

If you want to say people hear different t=
hings because of individualized messages, or psychic components, nothing is=
 stopping you.=C2=A0 If someone else wants to say there is no psychic compo=
nent, and that telling someone what they should hear can cause bias, they s=
hould be free to. 

The brave ones will test their claims.=C2=A0 Those who =
make claims, and insist they cannot be tested.. well... "most of us are sma=
rt enough to know" (your term) what that really means.

A simpler explanation is that, when listening to ambiguous audio, you te=

Seems to me.
