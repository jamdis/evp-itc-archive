<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello Ray

I was wondering who you were in messenger. I sent you back an add request. Welcome to the group. 

I had a chance to check your file. Water sounds are evident. I took the liberty of putting them thru my water filter. Some interesting results. I will give that to you later if I see you on.

&gt; Hi everyone just to introduce myself.  I&#x27;m Ray from
&gt; Yorkshire England, 
&gt; I&#x27;ve been doing research into EVP for a while now and
&gt; always on the 
&gt; lookout for improved techniques and better results.  Just
&gt; uploaded my 
&gt; first file under Ray&#x27;s File&#x27;s.  I obtained this EVP
&gt; while exploring a 
&gt; disused Lead Mine here in Yorkshire I was alone and armed
&gt; with a torch 
&gt; and Olympus VN-120pc digital voice recorder.  If you loop
&gt; the file you 
&gt; can hear the noise of dripping water from the roof of the
&gt; Mine and a 
&gt; distinct voice saying &quot;help Me&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Ray</pre>
