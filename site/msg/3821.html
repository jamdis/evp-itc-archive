<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Steve, I don&#x27;t doubt they were. As I said, I did hear a lot of it  
pretty clearly. It was quite intense and I listened to one file after  
the other, without stopping, because I was so interested. But I still  
didn&#x27;t hear a lot of what Chris &quot;interpreted.&quot; I did, however, hear a  
lot of things he did not comment on at all. For example, when the  
discussion was centered around the woman who kept claiming that she  
hid there and the guards brought her there, the historian from the  
prison said that the building you were in post-dated women being  
there.  I clearly heard the woman loudly respond by calling the  
historian &quot;bitch&quot; and &quot;c**t.&quot; I also clearly heard--and someone else  
onsite remarked on it--a clear radio fragment ending with &quot;dot.com!&quot;  
It was one of the loudest things on the recordings, actually. Now,  
this wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal, except that I got the idea that Chris&#x27;s  
box was somehow vaccinated against this occurring. ;)

But here&#x27;s my question to you: Did you see *any* of the shadows,  
apparitions, or crawling black shapes? Because what I heard was a lot  
of Chris going, &quot;Did you see that???!!! A black shadow just went  
right up the wall!&quot; and such, and everyone else going, &quot;Where? What?  
Huh?&quot; So, you personally, an eye witness?

&gt; where the shadow went up the wall. I didn&#x27;t see it, but i was
&gt; working a lot of equipment that night. They were pissed at that
&gt; time and we heard them talking at the end of the hall and not from
&gt; the box, so they were really there.

&gt; &gt; Here is the link to it, Frank. Give a listen when you have a
&gt; couple
&gt; &gt; hours.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I also listened to Steve H.&#x27;s 2 hour recording from Eastern State
&gt; &gt; Penn last night. I found some of it amazing and some of it wildly
&gt; &gt; annoying, especially the researcher close by the microphone who
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; chewing gum. That aside, there was more very odd and wonderful
&gt; &gt; communication, and also a lot of Chris seeing shadows,
&gt; apparitions,
&gt; &gt; black masses crawling down hallways, and other things that no one
&gt; &gt; else seemed to see. I wanted to ask Steve H. if he had witnessed
&gt; any
&gt; &gt; of this, since he was with Chris the whole time. For the
&gt; listener,
&gt; &gt; the effect was that of a veritable mob of live humans who (the
&gt; posse
&gt; &gt; that night) who were kept in a constant state of anxiety. They
&gt; didn&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; need the extra hype, HMO, &#x27;cause the pissed off dead inmates were
&gt; &gt; being surly enough on their own.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;d say I agreed with Chris&#x27;s interpretations--and granted, I was
&gt; not
&gt; &gt; there and did have problems hearing because of gum smacking and
&gt; other
&gt; &gt; people rustling and talking--about 30 percent of the time. That
&gt; said,
&gt; &gt; I heard a lot of things loud and clear.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Interesting. This is the &quot;eveidence&quot; I usaully don&#x27;t get to

&gt; &gt; &gt; researcher in the world gets nothing, he is the only one that
&gt; gets
&gt; &gt; &gt; the valid communucation, which personally I find highly
&gt; insulting.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; One fact is, I did not make a &quot;telephone to dead&quot;, I don&#x27;t
&gt; know
&gt; &gt; &gt; what the f--- that is, and I don&#x27;t endorse it! Nor do I
&gt; appreciate
&gt; &gt; &gt; my name being connected to the so called &quot;Telephone to dead&quot; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; every friggin&#x27; ad for Moon&#x27;s public appearances. I just make

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank--I have listened to this APSR broadcast and was
&gt; incredibly
&gt; &gt; &gt; impressed with what occurred at this event. Chris&#x27;s box is quite
&gt; &gt; &gt; capable of behaving like John Edward--directly bringing relations
&gt; &gt; &gt; through to talk to those who need to hear them. Some of the
&gt; responses
&gt; &gt; &gt; were astoundingly clear and loud. It certainly sounded similar
&gt; to what
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have heard of what Bruce is getting, and honestly, it is
&gt; exactly
&gt; &gt; &gt; what I hope to get with my box when I receive it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you haven&#x27;t listened to this, you really should. I think
&gt; Chris
&gt; &gt; &gt; made his usual statements about Edison and the 30, but aside from
&gt; &gt; &gt; that, this was a wonderful session and people were extremely
&gt; moved.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Christopher was immediately taken by what he had seen and
&gt; heard.
&gt; &gt; &gt; He was able to &gt; make a direct connection with spirits.
&gt; inhabitants,
&gt; &gt; &gt; victims, participants, and &gt; witnesses...describing amazing
&gt; events and
&gt; &gt; &gt; even some unspeakable acts that had &gt; happened within the walls
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; these notoriously haunted places. The details &gt; afforded by these
&gt; &gt; &gt; spirits gave answers to lingering questions that could not &gt;
&gt; have come
&gt; &gt; &gt; from anyone but the parties involved. Already amazed by the &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; instrument&#x27;s ability to connect with these historical figures,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Christopher soon &gt; realized that other entities were trying to
&gt; reach
&gt; &gt; &gt; out as well. Deceased fathers, &gt; sons, mothers, daughters, and
&gt; friends
&gt; &gt; &gt; of session participants were sending &gt; messages through the
&gt; device.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Talk of this spread, and last year, at the Ghost &gt; Chaser&#x27;s
&gt; Weekend
&gt; &gt; &gt; Conference in Savannah, Georgia, Christopher was asked to do a &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; presentation about his research with the Telephone to the Dead.
&gt; This
&gt; &gt; &gt; quickly &gt; turned into an impromtu public demonstration, with
&gt; &gt; &gt; participants, one by one, &gt; coming forward requesting to speak
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; loved ones who had died. Surprisingly, &gt; even to Christopher,
&gt; these
&gt; &gt; &gt; requests were met with comforting and sometimes vital &gt;
&gt; messages. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; presentation was recorded and broadcasted by A.P.S.R. Radio.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From a recent add for another presentation, but apparently
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; rest of us get nothing like this, so it doesn&#x27;t even work for us.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Guess I&#x27;ll just go back to killing time wth Ham radio, and quit
&gt; &gt; &gt; wasting all my time and money on useless boxes.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Curious that no one else gets any &quot;real&quot; contacts--event the
&gt; so
&gt; &gt; &gt; called box inventor gets nothing.
