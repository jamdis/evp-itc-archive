Sharon,
 
I do not believe it is us channeling at all, what I believe is t=
hat 
there is a harmonic transfer of mutual energy and vibration between us=
 and our tech.
 
yes it is communing in a way, but as far as our minds tele=
pathically sending subliminal
messages through the box. I do not believe th=
at to be so. I will not completely disregard the possibility,
I will consid=
er it with an open mind. As the research and our knowledge of the communica=
tion process
evolves through learning from our spirit friends, I believe th=
at eventually all questions will be answered.
 
Bruce
