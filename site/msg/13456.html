or many man years. cassette tape was as good as it got for audio thyen vhs =
cameras came in but low light slowed things down with them till the advent =
of fancy new fangled night vision and so forth the old infra red was as goo=

          It is truly ironic that part of my professiona=
l background and training happens to be in broadcast production. So I am in=
timately aware of what it takes to produce and distribute television progra=
ms and why and how this is done. I concur completely that it is inaccurate =
to view these shows as "reality". They are of course "entertainment. " (Act=
ually they have their own classification which came into being a few years =
ago.)

          What is troubling, perhaps only to me because of my backgr=
ound, is that such shows have come to represent to the public the state of =
affairs in this and related fields. The more investment there the more this=
 is obvious.
