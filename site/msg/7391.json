Why can&#39;t this \ntruth get out there to the ghost investigating community?  I plan on \nwriting about this in depth over the next month...I am so tired of \nseeing supposed &quot;experts&quot; on TV using demons to try and frighten \npeople with this religious dogma. \n\nThanks Rosemary for having this fact in your book under the \nword &quot;demon&quot; - most people are not aware this truth.  ;)\n\nLC\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; \n&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Personally, I don&#39;t watch that Hollywood stuff.

The name alone gets people interested, scared \nand \n&gt; so on. LOL Oh, I love Lorainne Warren&#39;s method of removing Chip \nfrom \n&gt; a trance. She slapped the shit out of him. he he hehe I almost fell \n&gt; over! You could hear the sarcastic &quot;thank you&quot; from Chip.

If ghosts are coming through the box \n&gt; &gt; and thus are not in a good state of mind, how come on Paranormal \n&gt; &gt; State CM was willing to believe the message given by the ghost \nvia \n&gt; &gt; the box as being truth (The ghost via the box said a &quot;demon&quot; was \n&gt; &gt; holding the ghosts captive there)? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would suggest that perhaps a ghost (assuming we are talking \nabout \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; disembodied person who remains earthbound) is not in a healthy \n&gt; state \n&gt; &gt; of mind one would consider &quot;stable,&quot; but trapped in emotional \n&gt; trauma \n&gt; &gt; of some sort. Thus, how reliable could the message of a ghost \nthen \n&gt; &gt; be? ;)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, &quot;wgungfu&quot; &lt;wgungfu3@ .&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Don&#39;t know if anyone caught it, but Frank&#39;s box was used on last\n&gt; &gt; &gt; night&#39;s episode of Paranormal State on A&E. They were \n&gt; investigating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an old insane asylum, and they had Chris Moon as a guest \n&gt; &gt; investigator\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the box. You can see the promo clip here:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.pennstat eprs.com/ ps_asylum. mov\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Here&#39;s the site for the show itself:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.aetv. com/paranormal- state/index. jsp\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For those not familiar, its a half hour show that follows along \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Penn State Paranormal Research Society&quot; and different cases \nthey \n&gt; &gt; take\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on. Their niche in the &quot;paranormal reality tv show&quot; market is \nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the group&#39;s leader follows a more Christian orientated skew on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happenings. Lots of &quot;demons&quot; (they have Lorraine Warren guest \nall \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time), and they usually try to do investigations/ communication \n&gt; only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; during what they call &quot;dead time&quot;, 3am-4am, or &quot;the polar \n&gt; opposite \n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3pm - the time Jesus gave is life for all mankind&quot; as they put \n&gt; it. \n&gt; &gt; Oh,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and they have an &quot;occult specialist&quot; on the team that so far \nhas \n&gt; &gt; been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anything but.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On the positive side, they did actually get (and record for \nlater\n&gt; &gt; &gt; analysis) live communication on the box in response to \nquestions \n&gt; &gt; being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; asked. And on the analysis and isolation of the recorded parts, \n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could actually hear what was being said (as opposed to the \nusual \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chris acting as a go-between for very distorted sounds like on \n&gt; those\n&gt; &gt; &gt; youtube videos). So it was good to see it a)working in \nthe &quot;field&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and b)get some exposure on a tv show.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Marty\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;   Looking for last minute shopping deals?
