Thank you!\n\nI&#39;m SO excited about what I&#39;m learning here, watching my earlier prejudices evaporate with each convincing recording.\n\nUnderstanding what&#39;s being recorded... that&#39;s the cool stuff. \n\nThree cheers for fewer distractions!\n\nGratefully,\nFiona\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  That person is no longer allowed ot contribute! I&#39;ve had it with these nasty negative attacks when we present--at least to us--what seems to be evidence, and/or discuss various methods and techniques. These &quot;skeptics&quot; accept no evidence and basically call anyone doing this research either crazy or liars.  They have no place on this group, this group is not about gettng accpetable evidence, or the &quot;proof&quot; that will play in some air head university, it&#39;s about exploring something that is real and demonstratable. I do think for myself and I don&#39;t need some duffus to tell me what is acceptable to think about.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
