Ok, I was trying to record how fast i got my little RS 20-125 I  went  out 
and bought this second radio, it's just like my other one, only this one i  
tried to snip the wire myself, and i sure made a mess of things, however 
take a  listen, please ignore the mess in the house, i haven't had a chance to 
clean  today.  Enjoy, they are funny, i was so nervous talking to them, i 
made a  few speech bluppers, right now they are yacking away out in the other  
room.  They are great!  Talking great too, and my radio is going super  
fast!   Right now, someone in the spirit world is yelling at me to  'clean 
house"  Enjoy, sf
