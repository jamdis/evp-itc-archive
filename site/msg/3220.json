However, I see the enormous\n&gt; potential for negative. Enormous. To not see that is, IMO, short- \n&gt; sighted.\n&gt;\n\nI see the negative, but I balance it against the positive. This is  \ncalled risk assessment, and we do it everyday for every action we  \ntake. To me, after neutral assessment of all the possibilities, both  \ngood and bad, and weighing of the evidence we do have from three to  \nfour decades of EVP and ITC, the rational conclusion appears to be  \nthat you take no more risk using a box then you do using a tape  \nrecorder. The box&#39;s realtime talkback ability does not allow for  \nextended messages-- they tend to be of the length of an EVP and  \nsometimes fragment in the middle, just as EVP do. So  a person might  \nhear &quot;You bastard,&quot; or such, but he is very unlikely to hear a long  \nand spellbinding seduction to come to the Dark Side. The only  \ndifference between the box and EVP, from what I have listened to so  \nfar, is that it can be heard in realtime--there can be a quick and  \nindisputable reply to a question. That doesn&#39;t mean it can always be  \nunderstood in realtime. I suspect box users are having to go back and  \nre-listen to actually hear what was said.\n\nAnyway, a neutral risk assessment shows clearly that one has a lot  \nless chance of being harmed by a box than by benefiting by it.\n\nPersonally, I&#39;m not afraid of these so-called dark entities. If I  \ndon&#39;t let them, they can&#39;t do a darned thing to me. Never have; never  \nwill. Worrying about them is a waste of time. Just approach the  \nresearch with a positive attitude and &quot;the stomach of a lion,&quot; the  \nquote Elizabeth I. And to quote another great leader, &quot;The only thing  \nwe have to fear is fear itself.&quot;\n\nAnn"}
