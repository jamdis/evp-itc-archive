Every once in a while everyone has to take a step back\nand breath. From what I am told that is what he is doing. Be patient\nand he will re-emerge and may take requests again.\n\nRegards,\n\nFrank Ratka\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot;\n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been doing evp research for a number of years now and have \n&gt; exhausted all venues so when something like this comes along of course \n&gt; it is a m7ust have for the serious researcher. I have been \n&gt; experimenting with the sweep method only for a few days but to me it is \n&gt; just another evp recording method and still needs to be edited and you \n&gt; don&#39;t have that real time communication.\n&gt; I was disabled at 911 and have all the time in the world to experiment \n&gt; so I believe the box would be put to good use. can anyone steer me in \n&gt; the right direction as far as who to contact or how to have a box built?\n&gt; \n&gt; all help is greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; bruce\n&gt;"}
