I think going to more compacted files will help us all in \n&gt; the long run. We are already back to 72% rather than 96% tho most of \n&gt; the file space was being used by someone else besides you =)\n&gt; \n&gt; I know it gets to be a bit testy around here and the other forums. I \n&gt; also know that some of the nastiness can tear apart good working \n&gt; relationships as well as friendships. I was just askin Frank if he \n&gt; knew if you were still sick or not because you had been very quiet \n&gt; lately.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree sometimes its good to take a step back rather than get \n&gt; yourself caught up in the drama fests going on around us all. Thats \n&gt; on and off the board as well. \n&gt; \n&gt; As I said I know some of what goes on off of this forum, and I am sad \n&gt; to see most of it happening. I just hope everyone can regain focus \n&gt; and like you said, remember why we are here.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope you feel better soon, and rejoin us when the stress level is \n&gt; passed. And I hope it passes soon so ya can run some test sessions \n&gt; with the new tool that arrived!\n&gt; \n&gt; I keep telling people that all the negativity does take a toll, on us \n&gt; personally and our working together. \n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Get a grip--all of you.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m out of here until all this petty BS and hatred sorts out. The  \n&gt; &gt; amount of stress that I&#39;ve been through with all this fighting \n&gt; since  \n&gt; &gt; early this year has really taken a toll on me as a person and a  \n&gt; &gt; researcher. I&#39;m going off line for awhile. If anyone wants to talk \n&gt; to  \n&gt; &gt; me, send me a private e-mail because I&#39;m going to read only/no e-\n&gt; mail  \n&gt; &gt; until I remember again why I used to wake up every day and want to  \n&gt; &gt; run to my computer to see what would be posted.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Misty--as per your request, I&#39;ve deleted my files.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
