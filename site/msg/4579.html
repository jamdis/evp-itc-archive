<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello all, I just signed up to this group this morning. I was talking
with a friend about EVPs last night, and she mentioned this forum
which I&#x27;d not heard of before. I&#x27;m really looking forward to reading
through the posts and seeing/listening to your evidence. 

I just took a quick look at some photos, which reminded me of what I&#x27;d
seen on the Scole Experiment book. Doing a search on the word &quot;Scole&quot;
in the forum turned up lots of results. I&#x27;m so excited to be in
contact with people who have actually even HEARD of the Scole
experiments! It makes me feel like some of the predictions or messages
received in the Scole communications are coming to fruition [as far as
that as a world-wide growing awareness of ITC and the possibilities it
represents].

I&#x27;m constantly surprised by the opportunities for connections and
knowledge that turn up during my constant quest for answers.

I hope I can contribute something worthwhile to this forum!

Deb T.</pre>
