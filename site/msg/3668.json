You say you don&#39;t know Chris\npersonally but that it seems I am the one wearing rose colored\nglasses. I do know Chris. Even when Frank is upset he says &quot;Chris is a\nnice guy&quot;. Chris&#39; statements and beliefs have never changed while\nothers can be wishy washy depending on the day. The view that Chris\ndoes not want any one to research the box besides him is BS. The fact\nis that prior to Franks original yahoo group disappearing, Chris\nprovided a link directly to the schematics. In his presentations he\nwould tell people that the schematics were available online. Yet,\nbecause he is against mass production, it MUST be because he wants the\nresearch all to himself. Rose colored glasses or a case of only seeing\nwhat is wanted? This is a fact compared to perceptions and opinions. \n\nFact: Almost each and every user of a box or it&#39;s facsimile have\nstated that lower energy/evil/dark... entities have spoken via the\ndevice. \n\nFact: Rick Moran states that the groups for testing will include\nbelievers, skeptics, senior citizens, (now here&#39;s where it gets scary)\nCHILDREN and HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS!\n\n- Couple the last two facts together and do the math. One mentally\nunstable child or youth hears the box tell him it is right to kill or\nrape or .....\n\nFact: Rick Moran in his article about Tools being only as good as the\nusers states, &quot;...know how they work before you go into the field.&quot; \nSo, in one place we are still testing, in another we are sending them\nout in the field to be tested by groups that include children and high\nschool students. The good thing is that a nice little online tutorial\nis available with some warnings. Phew! As long as this can&#39;t come back\non anyone I guess all the bases are covered (tongue in cheek). \n\nFact: Chris has been the primary tester of the device in the field.\nThat fact deserves consideration, at the very least. \n\nFact: Last night, a radio personality on Spooky South Coast claimed\nthat after he engaged the dark voices coming through the box, he was\nphysically attacked.\n\nFact: Frank has stated that in the beginning Chris was the only one\nwho understood how the box should be used.\n\nFact: Some people who have received boxes from Frank discovered they\nwere not able to use them although they worked fine for Frank. These\nsame people would not return the boxes to be looked at.\n\nFact: After death communications have been received via both computers\nand phones. If it were simply the devices and not the users would we\nnot have millions of these communications?\n\nFact: Mark Macy states that in an after death communication\ncommunication with Konstanin Raudive in which Mark asks &quot; Can you tell\nme about the equipment you use to produce a perfect, almost perfect\nvoice on earth?&quot; Konstanin replies &quot;Well it depends on your reception-\nor mainly your psychic reception.&quot; This fact backs up the theory that\neffective users are limited.\n\nFact: In another after death communication Konstanin addresses contact\nfields saying &quot;...but if there is dissonance in the form of fears,\ndoubts, and animosities the contact field becomes cloudy...that&#39;s when\nnegative spirit groups close to earth in vibration can break into\nexisting bridges with troubling results.&quot;\n\n\nAnd so yes, maybe I wear rose colored glasses. However, I am inclined\nto believe that I have done my research and have availed myself of\nquite a bit of information regarding this topic. \n\nWith that said, I am holding an online event where people can ask\nChris the questions they want as long as they are formed in an\nintelligent manner. If you are interested in attending the event you\ncan find the information on the front page of my site at\nwww.thepsinetwork.com I felt it unnecessary to attempt to &quot;bridge the\ngap&quot; as well between speculation, insinuation and fact. \n\nSincerely,\nBabs\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Lance Oliver&quot; &lt;orbhunterx@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey Bab,\n&gt; \n&gt; Even though I&#39;ve newly begun to chime in here, it seems to me that \n&gt; some people are guilty of wearing rose colored glasses, as far as \n&gt; Chris is concerned. LOL! I don&#39;t know him personally, so I really \n&gt; don&#39;t know what really motivates him. Right or wrong, by conducting \n&gt; himself in the manner he has, it&#39;s understandable why his approach \n&gt; has drawn the scrutiny from his peers. \n&gt; \n&gt; Frankly, this entire effort is a great learning experience and \n&gt; potential healing for mankind! I encourage all of us researcher types \n&gt; to simply sit back, and take a deep breath or three. Consider \n&gt; together why we&#39;re doing this. Let&#39;s work on making this world a \n&gt; better place while we have breath...\n&gt; \n&gt; Success!\n&gt; Lance\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;babiarz3&quot; &lt;babiarz3@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bruce- Wow! That is a very bold statement, minus the name of the\n&gt; &gt; person you are accusing (although it&#39;s clear who you are referring \n&gt; to). \n&gt; &gt; I did read your apology for the negativity you&#39;ve helped spread \n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; Christopher Moon. I acknowledge that your apology took a great deal \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; humility. However, knee jerk reactions are exactly what I&#39;ve been\n&gt; &gt; talking about. People doing or saying without thought and \n&gt; consideration. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think someone that stands to loose there bread and butter is \n&gt; making \n&gt; &gt; &gt; idle threats or having someone else do it.
