I have been researching this concept, and I \nmyself hope to one day be able to receive clear and concise messages which would enable \nme to contact the spirit&#39;s loved one to give them that message should they wish to receive \nit.

How true is that.-Steve --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Early Cuyler \n&lt;ecuyler@ &gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Margaret, I can&#39;t argue with what you&#39;ve said. I&#39;m just saying there \nare those who take advantage and should have no business in doing so. One example I \ncan give is Chris Moon. He charges people to do box sessions. I can&#39;t remember the exact \nfee, but it&#39;s outrageous that he&#39;s doing this, not to mention, he does so with a Frank&#39;s box. \nHe is a self proclaimed medium and I&#39;ve heard from many sources that he is nothing but a \nfake. &gt; &gt; So I attribute my frustration with people of this type, but again I say, as long as \nthere are people dumb enough to pay for this, then there will always be those who take \nadvantage.&gt; &gt; Personally, I feel anyone who is gifted with mediumship or other advanced \nintuitive abilities should use it as a gift to help others, not for monetary gain.. I&#39;m not \nbeing judgmental here, that&#39;s just how I feel. I have a friend who is also a legitimate \nmedium and I don&#39;t agree that she should use her abilities for gain, but it doesn&#39;t mean I \nlike her any less. My not liking it won&#39;t change the fact that it happens, it&#39;s just the way \nthings go. &gt; &gt; Do I think that Ron is taking advantage of people? No I don&#39;t. Ron says he \nuses the best parts available and that the cost of the Minibox is very close to what it costs \nto manufacture it. How close, I have no idea. On the other hand, I don&#39;t own one as I think \n$399 or $449 for the &quot;crystal enhanced version,&quot; is a lot to pay for a device that, from \nwhat I&#39;ve heard, produces the same results as a Radio Shack radio for $25-$40. &gt; &gt; \nJeremy&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----&gt; From: itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@ ...&gt;&gt; \nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&gt; Sent: Saturday, April 5, 2008 1:32:28 PM&gt; Subject: \n[EVP-ITC] Re: boxes on ebay&gt; &gt; Hi Jeremy. If everyone knew about these support boards \nand that other resources are &gt; available to them, that would be one thing. Obviously \neveryone here is aware of that. But &gt; not everyone knows this place exists. &gt; &gt; And even if \nthey do know about the boards here, how many would have the nerve to ask &gt; for help \nfrom strangers? As Bruce recently shared, he gives people invitations to contact &gt; him \nprivately in case they are too shy just ask a question publicly. Which means, by the &gt; way, \nto some degree they have overcome some of that shyness in order to post whatever it &gt; \nwas to begin with, which inspired him to make this offer. What if they don&#39;t even have the \n&gt; gumption to be anything more than be a look-i-loo?&gt; &gt; I&#39;m guessing many people are \njust surfing the net, checking out paranormal stuff, and run &gt; across the hacked boxes \nfor sale. &gt; &gt; Again, I ask people who are taking the position you and Bruce are regarding \nprofits ... do &gt; you have this same harsh sentiment toward Ron Ricketts, who makes and \nsells the &gt; MiniBoxes? I realize he is passionate about this research and helping others. \nDoes that &gt; give him amnesty for making a profit? &gt; &gt; Personally I think we need to not \nbe so judgmental. At what point does &quot;profitable gain in &gt; the paranormal field&quot; become \n&quot;sickening?&quot; I have a friend who is a medium. I mean THE &gt; REAL DEAL. He charges for his \nservices. The fee is reasonable compared to many in his &gt; field. Does he do this because \nhe&#39;s a terrible person looking to take advantage of people? &gt; NO, he does so because he \nhas been given a gift that changes people&#39;s lives for the better. &gt; But he has to make a \nliving.... has to support himself in some way. And because he has &gt; chosen to provide this \nservice full time (and is not a trust fund baby), he makes a profit. &gt; This allows him to \nhelp far more people than he could if working some other kind of job &gt; and providing his \nservices at no cost on the side. &gt; &gt; I realize this is not exactly the same thing as gouging \npeople on the price for a &gt; commercially available product, but making such blanket \nstatements about profitability in &gt; the paranormal field being sickening is rather short-\nsighted, in my opinion. &gt; &gt; I have a southern friend who likes to say, &quot;It&#39;s a mighty thin \nplank that ain&#39;t got two sides.&quot; &gt; I just don&#39;t think we have the right to claim that simply \nbecause someone is offering a &gt; good and or service for profit to consumers in the \nparanormal market, that this &gt; automatically means they are taking advantage of other&#39;s \nvulnerabilities. &gt; &gt; For Pete&#39;s sake, no one is twisting the people&#39;s arms to buy those units \non eBay. They are &gt; perfectly free to buy from whatever source they choose. Since the \nunits do work as &gt; claimed, we can argue that people have overpaid, shopped unwisely, or \nwhatever. I assure &gt; you this happens every single day throughout the retail market place \nwith all types of &gt; products and services. &gt; &gt; I will say I have a fairly heathy dose of \ndistain for charlatans/scam artists (of any flavor in &gt; any field) but that is not what we are \ntalking about here. We are talking about people who &gt; are offering legitimate products to \nconsumers. I&#39;d rather see people doing this for profit, &gt; even when obscene, than running \nscams that damage people&#39;s physical, mental, and/or &gt; financial well-being. &gt; &gt; \nMargaret&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Early Cuyler &lt;ecuyler@ &gt; wrote:&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; \nVery well put, Bruce. Profitable gain in the paranormal field is sickening.. Unfortunately, &gt; \nthere are those who continue to support the ones profiting, so it will continue.
