Bruce says, they were just using a radio box, like an RS 120-150 to get  
t=
hat it just wasn't in the picture, that gal on the video says, she puts  
a=
luminum foil on the top to block out some noise, and only allow the closer =
 
spirits to come through, I guess it limits them from talking too much or =
 
something. sf

Don't  the voices on that video sound a bit "scr=
ubbed"?  There's not a lot 
of  click-click or background noise ... sounds =

With a  price tag of nearly $300, I would need to hea=
r a pretty convincing 
testimonial  before I would shell out quite that muc=
h cash.   What do you  
think?
