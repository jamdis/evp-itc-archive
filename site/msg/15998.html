&gt;  someday maybe. Alot of this stuff I&#x27;m doing is surface mount components, which can be tedious to put on a board.

&gt; &gt; So Frank, are you going to sell kits for the DIYer for the new boards with parts and schematic?

&gt; &gt; Catch up from a trip sucks! I got more parts ordered along with printed circuit boards. Soooo, might be able to produce something a bit more professional looking. I&#x27;d like to make two versions, TRF, and hetrodyne, but it&#x27;s going to take a while to get it all together. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I tried recording on the boat with a shack hack, the 470, but only got he usual doomsville junk I get everywhere. FM was the only mode cuz the metal ship hull shileds out all AM signals unless you hand the box out a port hole. Even FM was spotty. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Shermer&#x27;s talk/presentation was interresting!

&gt; &gt; &gt;  This was coming back to Denver, Security never even looked inside the boxes
&gt; &gt; &gt; on the way, even with all the electronics and echo chambers made out of
&gt; &gt; &gt; pipe. &quot;We don&#x27;t need to look at these boxes&quot;-- waving the hand using the

Since I am a newby can anyone help me on how to get started and what equipment I would need?  I have talked to a spirit on the other side but it was through someone.  That is why I am interested in how to obtain Frank&#x27;s box.  Thanks for your help
