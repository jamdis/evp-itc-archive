Some \nwe can make out very easily and some are harder to hear.  Chris Moon \nhas a lot of experience with it, so it&#39;s a little easier for him to \ninterpret sometimes.  Someone else has the audio recordings and she&#39;s \ngoing through them.\n\nI&#39;m curious too!  :)\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, LON3_S7AR &lt;lon3_s7ar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; interesting\n&gt;   have you listened to the messages again?\n&gt;   since you heard them the first time?\n&gt;   curious to know what happens!\n&gt;   amy in san antone\n&gt;"}
