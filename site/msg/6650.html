Hi Bruce   Just listened to your 125 files.  Dispite the signal problem you said you were having in your basement those were very clear files to my ear.  Maybe I am tuned to that box but it is exciting for me because I chatted with Mike as you suggested and he is sending a 125 already hacked for me to pick up in San Diego with I get there in two weeks.
   
  It sounds like the 125 has a faster scan rate than the 469 and it does not have the clicking noise.  
   
  I hope you can do more sessions with it and in a better signal area.  
   
  If my 125 doesn't work for me when I bring it back to Mexico, I will send you an airline ticket so you can come over here and get us all dialed in...just kidding, but not a bad thought.  
   
  Also, I hope you don't give up on posting to the esnap files as a test because I think there is a real advantage to that program.  For some reason, I am able to get all your posts whether they are as an attachment or in the files.  I also got your esnap.  In the reverse, I am often not able to open Steve's files or Ann's, regardless where they are.  
   
  Ann was to post an esnap but I have never seen it.  Might be my problem.  Ron L

  I heard all of those pretty much perfectly.  This last one is quite touching, really.
