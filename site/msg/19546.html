[At=
tachment(s) from leongbabe@... included below] 

Hi Draiga, Ursula, CB,=
 and Rick, and all others interested in this topic:
=C2=A0
As promised, I'v=
e attached a jpeg with the results of my camera experiment using 1) digital=
 point n' shoot camera, 2) Moditronics Deep IR camera, 3) Moditronics Full =
( "Duo") Spectrum camera, and 4) a Nikon camera converted into a Full Spect=
rum camera.=C2=A0 I took these shots, one after the other, and from the sam=
e angle, in a purportedly haunted alley in San Francisco's Chinatown.=C2=A0=
 Please note that I took these photos=C2=A0during the day, which was one of=
 the reasons I purchased the two Moditronics cameras - their cameras=C2=A0d=
on't see into the visible spectrum and thus prevent against visible light w=
ashing out any possible images that may be lurking in the IR and UV spectru=
ms.=C2=A0 And, as you can see from the attached jpeg, in the fire escape on=
e can see what looks like a head floating in the two photos I took with Mod=
itronics Duo Spectrum and Deep IR cameras.=C2=A0 In the two photos taken wi=
th the regular point n' shoot camera and the full spectrum camera, you can'=
t
 see the floating head at all because the visible light washed it out.=C2=
=A0 Again, for night time investigations, the drawback with the Moditronics=
 cameras is that you will need some kind of external light source in order =
to see anything (or, you can always turn on some lights - if lights are ava=
ilable, why sit in the dark?)
=C2=A0
Ursula, don't get me wrong, I think th=
e SpecterCam 3 is a wonderful full spectrum camera (as a matter of fact, I'=
ve just purchased one as a present to myself!).=C2=A0 I'm going to experime=
nt with it and will probably buy a filter for it that will block some of th=
e visible light because, again, I don't want visible light possibly washing=
 out the IR and UV spectrums, especially if I investigate during the day (I=
 also investigate a lot of battlefields and many battlefields close early).=

=C2=A0
Apologies to the rest of you who may be asking, what does this have=
 to do with EVPs?=C2=A0 Well, photos of true anomalies can help substantiat=
e any EVPs captured and, I might add here, the Moditronics camcorders also =
record sound (unlike DVR cameras, such as Spectercams, where you would need=
 to have a separate audio recorder if you want sound to go with the images)=
.=C2=A0 And yes, I have=C2=A0also=C2=A0picked up=C2=A0EVPs=C2=A0on my camco=
rders.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Finally, CB, I agree with you, the SVP cameras that Mod=
itronics use for their conversions are pretty flimsy in construction (plast=
ic casing).=C2=A0 I've accidentally banged my Deep IR camera against the ge=
ar shift in the car and (Sob!) the bottom of the camera broke off from the =
tripod.=C2=A0 I duck-taped it back together and it still works, though (whe=
w!).=C2=A0 (And yes, I, too, have noticed that the Ghost Hunters used=C2=A0=
the Moditronics full spectrum camera on one of their shows this year.)
=C2=
=A0
Therefore, Rick, don't sweat it.=C2=A0 For what you get for the price, =
I think you did fine.=C2=A0 But like CB said, don't drop these cameras or b=
ang them around too much.
=C2=A0
Lastly, I think all kinds and grades of ca=
meras are worth experimenting with.=C2=A0 I've even captured a very interes=
ting light anomaly with a cheap throwaway camera and have seen what appeare=
d to be an apparition taken with a point n' shoot.=C2=A0 So, whatever one c=
an afford, go with it!
=C2=A0
Happy Holidays Everyone!
