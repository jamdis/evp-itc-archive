Sound Soap is a manual tuning method to an audio file.  It \nhas a bar on the bottom that can be manually moved by the user with the \nmouse.  What i did today was experiment with Stefan&#39;s Allophone file \ninto the Sound Soap program and manual sweep the audible tones.  I \nthink this may be the best files i ever got so far, please listen and \nlet me know what you guys think.  These files were from a 3 min. \nsession with minimal editing.  I&#39;ve had this program for months and \nnever used it, i think Bruce gave it to me.\n\n-Steve H."}
