Now that you mention the 20-125, I remember\n&gt; &gt; reading about Steve hacking it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve got the 12-469 & 70 burned in my brain. Every time I&#39;m near a\n&gt; &gt; Radio Shack, I stop in to see if they have an older 470. I will\n&gt; &gt; certainly try out the 20-125.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I had actually been seriously thinking about getting a Mini Box, but\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s a hefty price tag. Especially since I have no experience with\n&gt; &gt; box research at this point.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jeremy\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, juli velazquez &lt;ghostchasingfool@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jeremy: IF you are unable to find an old 470 and you dont\n&gt; &gt; care for the clicking on the 69, why don&#39;t you try the 20-125? This\n&gt; &gt; has the internal speaker and you can hack that as well. I believe\n&gt; &gt; Steve has directions on his site, keyportparanormal.com.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Good luck!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Juli\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ecuyler &lt;ecuyler@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I just read on the Paranormal Systems website that they\n&gt; &gt; are developing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a new box called the MaxiBox. It has a lot of features I&#39;ve heard\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce mention that would be beneficial to the boxes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, I&#39;ve been trying my best to locate an older 12-470 to  \n&gt; &gt; modify so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I could start doing the research. I know there is the 12-469, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been hesitant because of all the talk about the annoying click.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jeremy\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The contents of this eletronic correspondence is private &\n&gt; &gt; confidential and meant only for the party and/or parties it is\n&gt; &gt; addressed to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; No part of this email transmission may be publicly posted or\n&gt; &gt; forwarded to other parties without explicit written permission.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
