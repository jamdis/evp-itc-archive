I build very slow, but always try to make something different. This is another one of a kind sweep.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seems there isn&#39;t much interest in the boxes anymore though. I make them and stick it in the corner to collect dust. I put them on EBAY or offer it to the groups, but no response from either.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s why i don&#39;t make many anymore, what am i going to do with all of these?\n&gt; \n&gt; I get a lot of e-mails for a box, but it&#39;s all the same thing and frank can attest to this to.\n&gt; \n&gt; They want me to build them a box and ship it to them for FREE, usually because they are a TAPS family member or somebody halfway famous in the field.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can&#39;t do that anymore, i ran out of money and frank is retired.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I heard your name in the second clip..it sounds really good\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Fri, 1/28/11, urkel23@ &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: urkel23@ &lt;urkel23@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] First New Box of 2011----Steve&#39;s Box #42 [2 Attachments]\n&gt; &gt; To: rtsc@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Friday, January 28, 2011, 6:18 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Â  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Attachment(s) from urkel23@ included below] \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Â \n&gt; &gt; I call this circuit a hybrid sweep.Â  It is a blend of random and linear modes together.Â  It sweeps in a linear fashion, but has a runaway speed change to it.Â  Let me know what you guys think of it.\n&gt; &gt; Â \n&gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt; Â \n&gt; &gt; Â \n&gt; &gt; Â \n&gt; &gt; Steve Hultay\n&gt; &gt; www.keyportparanormal.com\n&gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/\n&gt; &gt; www.stevehultay.com\n&gt; &gt; www.rtscresearch.org\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
