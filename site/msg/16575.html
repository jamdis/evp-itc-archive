They tried several different designs. If memory serves correct, only one of=
 the designs actually worked, but it was just an unreasonable amount of eff=
ort for very little output, so they were all busted in the end.

I am sure =
you could find the episode online some where. Sorry I can't remember specif=
ics-it was a long time ago.

  What free energy machines did t=

  If it was John Bedini's, I don't doubt it.

      Well as a great lover of Radio Shack's various projects (150 in 1=
 was my fave), I'm pretty sure you will not be able to build a sweeping AM =
radio from that.  Sorry.  But they are great to learn basic principles from=
.

      Also while the jury is still out on whether or not free energy mac=
hines exist, it is definitely not going to be able to be built using a radi=
o shack learning lab.  Otherwise everyone would have one by now and we woul=
d not need the power companies.

      I also would l=
