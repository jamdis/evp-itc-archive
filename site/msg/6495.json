I had\nithooked up to a Behringer Xenyx 1622FX mixer along with a Shure\nSM58microphone running to the computer and recorded in Audacity. I\nlive in Dayton, Ohio. There there are a handful of AM stationsaround.\nThe most prominent being 700 WLW out of Cincinnati. Theproblem I&#39;ve\nrun into is that the stations that come in clearly startanywhere from\n2-4 bands before and after their actual frequency.I also have a RS\n20-125. I&#39;m getting ready to do another session in afew minutes so\nI&#39;ll use the 20-125. I know it probably won&#39;t makemuch of a difference\nas far as signal goes, but I&#39;m gonna try it out.Jeremy--- In\nEVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday&lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt;\nwrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Jeremy,&gt; &gt; Are you using a 12-469 or 470 ?&gt; If you are\nusing a 469, what is the set up&gt; are you recording directly from the\nbox and &gt; using a splitter with a speaker attached ?&gt; &gt; Or recording\nfrom the stand alone 470?&gt; &gt; The reason I ask is because other than\nthe single word response you&gt; are receiving, I hear no indication of\nthe RS box sweeping the stations.&gt; It is all static noise except for\nthe message. &gt; &gt; You are not getting any signal at all.&gt; you should be\nhearing the different stations change and continuousfragments of\nspeech&gt; while the box sweeps the band.&gt; &gt; Let me know where you are\nand how you are setting up for a session.If you are getting that\nresponse without any clear signal&gt; think of how you will communicate\nwith even a half way decent signal.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; Bruce Halliday &gt; &gt; &gt;\nFrom: EVP-ITC@: EVP-ITC@: Mon, 28 Jan 2008 22:50:54+0000Subject:\n[EVP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,This email\nmessage is a notification to let you know thatafile has been uploaded\nto the Files area of the EVP-ITC group.File :/Jeremy&#39;s Files/Session 1\nreview_what is name_STU.wav Uploaded by :ecuyler &lt;ecuyler@&gt;\nDescription : 3 what is name_STU You can accessthis file at\ntheURL:http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Jeremy%27s%20Files/Session%201%20review_what%20is%20name_STU.wavTo\nlearn more about file sharing for your group,\npleasevisit:http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfilesRegards,ecuyler&lt;ecuyler@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n__________________________________________________________&gt; Climb to\nthe top of the charts!
