<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The other night I had a neighbor over. I&#x27;ve know him for two years. I 
have been experimenting with evp for awhile but never really got into it 
until a couple months ago. My neighbor always complains about hearing 
footsteps in his apartment but that there is never anyone there. I live 
above him and have some activity myself. When he stopped the other night 
I asked if while he was here could I put a recorder in his place and he 
said yes. I showed him how to turn it on and he went downstairs. I asked 
that he have everything turned off and he said he did. However, he 
forgot to turn his fan off. I now have over an hours worth of recording 
of a fan running. I just started using Gold Wave. Does anyone - without 
getting to technical - know how to remove the fan?

Any help would be appreciated.
