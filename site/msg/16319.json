N=\r\nASA astronomer David Morrison gives his take.\n \nWed Oct 01, 2008 06:59 PM E=\r\nT | content provided by David Morrison \n\n \nThe ancient Mesopotamians predic=\r\nted Nibiru? Don&#39;t bet on it.\nNASA\n\n\nThe scoop: Conspiracy theorists are con=\r\nvinced a rogue planet will destroy the Earth in 2012, and just as we are ab=\r\nout to see the release of a Hollywood movie on the topic, the hype is set t=\r\no increase. David Morrison, a NASA astrobiologist and expert scientist for =\r\nNASA&#39;s Ask an Astrobiologist website, calls for a reality check and in 2008=\r\n he contributed this article to Discovery News.\n\nUnbeknownst to most of us,=\r\n a small but vocal group of conspiracy theorists is convinced that a rogue =\r\nplanet is about to enter the inner solar system and doom the Earth.\n\nThey s=\r\nay that this threatening planet on a 3600-year orbit was discovered by the =\r\nancient Mesopotamians, who named it Nibiru, and it was known also to the Ma=\r\nyans, who associated it with the end of their calendar &quot;long count&quot; in Dece=\r\nmber 2012. In Web sites, blogs, and radio talk shows, they insist that NASA=\r\n is tracking Nibiru -- but that this information is being kept from the pub=\r\nlic as part of a worldwide conspiracy.\n\nThey say the official silence can&#39;t=\r\n be maintained for much longer, however, because by 2009 Nibiru will be vis=\r\nible to the naked eye from the southern hemisphere. They also say Earth&#39;s a=\r\nxis is already tilting and the length of the day is changing under its infl=\r\nuence. As one believer recently wrote to me, &quot;Why are you lying. It&#39;s comin=\r\ng, and everyone knows it.&quot;\n\nI began to receive questions about this bizarre=\r\n story in December 2007 through NASA&#39;s &quot;Ask an Astrobiologist&quot; site. Normal=\r\nly I receive up to a dozen questions per week from the public, dealing most=\r\nly with life in the universe -- but in the past 6 months the Nibiru traffic=\r\n alone has grown to 20-25 messages a week, ranging from the anguished &quot;I ca=\r\nn&#39;t sleep,&quot; &quot;I am really scared&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want to die&quot; to the abusive &quot;y=\r\nou are putting my family at risk&quot; and &quot;if NASA denies it then it must be tr=\r\nue.&quot;\n\nAs a scientist, I&#39;m both fascinated and astonished by the deluge of q=\r\nuestions from people who are genuinely frightened and, apparently, unable t=\r\no distinguish astronomical fact from fiction. They&#39;re watching YouTube vide=\r\nos and visiting slick Web sites with nothing in their skeptical toolkit, or=\r\n to quote Carl Sagan no &quot;baloney detector.&quot; Now a blockbuster disaster film=\r\n called &quot;2012&quot; is set for release in the summer of 2009, and the commercial=\r\n enterprise is clearly trying to cash in on people&#39;s concern (perhaps contr=\r\nibuting to their fear as well).\n\nMy guess is that only a tiny fraction of p=\r\neople truly believes that Armageddon is coming in December 2012. But their =\r\nuncritical acceptance of this story worries me as a warning of the dangers =\r\nof our current scientific illiteracy.\n\nWe&#39;re facing monumental problems wit=\r\nh global warming and loss of habitat, yet a substantial minority of America=\r\nns thinks the world was formed less than 10,000 years ago and deny that evo=\r\nlution is possible. Many Americans seem to prefer coal-fired generators to =\r\nnuclear power plants without realizing the toll in public health that coal =\r\nimposes. Billions are spent, including tax-payer dollars, for so-called alt=\r\nernative medicine with no scientific evidence for its efficacy. And legisla=\r\ntors often resist efforts to collect the data that could actually demonstra=\r\nte which government programs are effective and which ones don&#39;t work as int=\r\nended.\n\nIn spite of my frustrations, I can always hope that Nibiru will tur=\r\nn into a teaching moment. Its proponents are convinced that it will be visi=\r\nble to the unaided eye this coming spring, and its effects on the rotation =\r\nand orbit of the Earth will be obvious by summer (just in time for the rele=\r\nase of the film &quot;2012&quot;). When none of this happens, I hope they&#39;ll realize =\r\nthat they need better tools to distinguish fact from fiction.\n\r\n------=_NextPart_001_0067_01CA6D0A.BFCC7AB0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18852&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYL=\r\nE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;H1&gt;Nibiru - Armageddon Planet or Astronomical Baloney=\r\n?&lt;/H1&gt;\n&lt;H2&gt;My Take: Conspiracy theorists are convinced that a rogue planet =\r\nis bound to \ndoom Earth in 2012.
