They have \nbeen doing so for a long time, so I have no fear of where I am \nheading - even with this.  I realize it is different for each \nindividual.\n\nPersonally, I think if someone is full of fear, they shouldn&#39;t be \ninvestigating ghosts, etc. Find what keeps you out of fear and roll \nwith it...\n\nLC\nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rosemary_guiley&quot; &lt;reguiley@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I think it&#39;s good to air diverse opinions on whether or not \nprotection\n&gt; measures are advisable.  I agree that it&#39;s a matter of personal\n&gt; preference, and I think researchers need to experiment to find their\n&gt; own optimum comfort/performance levels.  What works for some will \nnot\n&gt; for others.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Personally, I find that an overall, daily approach of\n&gt; prayer/meditation concerning all of my personal and professional\n&gt; endeavors is the most effective for me.  I don&#39;t do it to keep \nthings\n&gt; out, but to try to stay oriented on the most positive track.  Words,\n&gt; thoughts and objects have all been demonstrated universally to be\n&gt; tools of spiritual power.  Why not use them if it feels appropriate?\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the best things we can do is share &quot;here&#39;s what works for me&quot;\n&gt; and let others try it to see for themselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks, everyone,\n&gt; Rosemary\n&gt;"}
