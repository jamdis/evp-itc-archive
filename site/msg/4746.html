&gt; Hiya Steve. Happy New Year! 
&gt;    
&gt;   All methods are welcome here. I dont post my stuff so much for 
feedback as just to share what the messages are. If I want feedback I 
email private to someone. No matter what method is used, people will 
hear thier own way. Sometimes they hear what I hear sometimes they 
hear a totally different message for themselves, sometimes they just 
hear blahbedeblah/nothin .
&gt;    
&gt;   Watch out for that negative energy thats building =) it will only 
get in the way of the research. If one method isnt your cup of tea, 
try another. There are so many choices that I am always adding 
something new to the list of things I tried that had results, whether 
good or cruddy it all gets documented and I move on.
&gt;    
&gt;   Yeah people have been really busy. I think we have a case of 
active member syndrome. Either they are actively focused on another 
topic of discussion (hopefully not a war of words) or they are like 
me and just too dang busy working to have much free time to remark on 
all the files we listen to. If you ever &quot;need&quot; feedback just 
holler...you know my email and private emails usually get priority 
response whether Im busy or not.

&gt;           Hey, Misty at least people are responding to your audio 
files. I 
&gt; haven&#x27;t had any feedback on my posts in months. Being that this 
&gt; board has nothing to do with ITC research anymore and more about 
&gt; appliances that are broken. People are probably wondering why 
&gt; occasionally some are posting audio files, maybe we are wrong for 
&gt; imposing on their chat room. I have a toaster on the fritz so maybe 
&gt; i can join in on the chat now.

&gt; &gt; Bruce,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Happy New Year to you too! Thanks for tryin but sometimes its 
&gt; just not for everyone ears. Never know who hears what til ya post 
it 
&gt; =) I dont worry about quality so much anymore because whats crystal 
&gt; clear for some sounds like blahbedeblah to others. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Misty
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Misty,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Happy new year, I listened to the files a few times and unless 
you 
&gt; read 
&gt; &gt; what they are labeled I could not hear anything but misty in the 
&gt; second one
&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t think it was quality just volume of the voice itself.

&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know if maybe the audio pick up from the box wasn&#x27;t 
&gt; very good, 
&gt; &gt; but I can&#x27;t make out much of that either. It sounds like the 
&gt; recordings 
&gt; &gt; I do with a cell phone. I think you&#x27;d have to be there to judge 
it. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Personally I&#x27;m always disappointed at my stuff being out there, 
and 
&gt; &gt; the incredible lack of clarity obatained with it, to me that&#x27;s a 
&gt; huge 
&gt; &gt; failure! I know the stuff works, but how to get it to a level 
that 
&gt; can 
&gt; &gt; be understood by most, that&#x27;s the problem, and my focus at the 
&gt; moment. 
&gt; &gt; The Mini Box is big step in that direction, so some of the 
pressure 
&gt; if 
&gt; &gt; off, but I still need to get my boxes to professional level.
