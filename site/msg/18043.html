You seem to be having enormous problems with my files. I hope I didn't mess=
 them up.
They continue to work for me.

What kind of computer/OS are you u=
sing?=C2=A0 What happens when you double click on the files?=C2=A0 Or is it=
 just trouble following the link?

Thanks again for everyone who participate=
d! I admire your courage and 
  motivation to try different methods, see wh=
at works, and try to improve 
  everyone's understanding of EVP-ITC.

If yo=
u recall, on 7/10/2010 I 
  placed an object on top of my computer monitor,=
 right in front of me, and left 
  it there until today, 7/14/2010, noon De=
nver time. The experiment was for 
  participants to determine what it was.=
 Vague or partial answers wouldn't be 
  counted (for example, just colors,=
 shapes, sizes, what it's made of, etc): 
  we're looking for what it is. P=
articipants could use their ghost boxes, EVP 
  recorders, or I suppose any=
 other means they chose.

In order to keep me 
  honest, I took a picture o=
f the object at the start of the experiment and 
  loaded it to the Files s=
ection (RJ folder) of this group. If you can follow 
  the link, it is here=
:

http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710. 1.z=
ip

The 
  idea was that you could download the file at the beginning of th=
e test, and 
  'keep it safe' on your computer. Then at the end of the test=
, I would release 
  the password so you could reveal the contents of the f=
ile. That way, you were 
  in control of the original image during the enti=
re test, not me. 

The 
  password for that file is: 123BlastOff
Instructio=
ns, if you need them, are 
  also in that RJ folder.

And if you did not ca=
re to download the zip 
  file before the test, I will post the final image=
 there too.

So to the 
  results:

Number of participants: 5
Total tries: =
8
Ambiguous 
  answers: 0
Correct answers: 0

Object: A radio
Uzipped 
  pi=
cture:
http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710.=
 1.JPG

So 
  what do the results mean? All that we can really agree on fro=
m this experiment 
  is that no participant, with whatever theories or meth=
ods or technology they 
  used, was able to correctly determine the object.=
 We can't say those theories 
  or methods or technologies never work. Just=
 as we can't say they do. Just 
  that, for whatever reason, they did not w=
ork this time. Readers can take the 
  results, use them to improve or chan=
ge their methods, or keep doing what 
  they're doing.

If anyone has any o=
bservations, comments, or ideas for 
  improvement, let me know. I hope to =
get a new experiment up and running soon. 
  Since there wasn't much partic=
ipation Mon-Wed, I think the next experiment 
  will be arranged to mostly =
span the weekends.

Again, thanks to everyone 
  who participated in this f=
irst experiment.
