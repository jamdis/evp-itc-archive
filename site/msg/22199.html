<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have been quiet through alot of this, and I speak to Frank from time to
time in private emails. I think some forget that you can argue theory and
ideas,  but not be personal or petty. We can be civil and friends the end
of the day, we may agree to disagree about topics, but the proof is in the
data,isn&#x27;t it? Frank is a really nice guy and I have always been treated
well by him, learned from him and respect his work. He has put in tireless
amounts of time and effort into his boxes and has always welcomed ideas and
discussion on anything he has posted. Can we go back to the scope of this
group and leave the drama at the door?
