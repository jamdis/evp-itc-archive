<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>As always, it was a pleasure working with you Rosemary. It was also a
great treat to spend what little time we had with Frank. It was an
enlightening experience all the way around.

&gt; I was at The Stanley Hotel in Colorado last weekend, and was excited to
&gt; get to work with the new Mini-Box built by Ron Ricketts.   I was also
&gt; happy to meet Frank for the first time!   I had several sessions with
&gt; the Mini-Box with April and Allen Slaughter of the Association for the
&gt; Study of Unexplained Phenomena, and found it quite impressive.  Very
&gt; compact, long battery life (and rechargeable) and good clarity.  &quot;Seven&quot;
&gt; came through for me in every session.  We had a session with Mark Macy,
&gt; and a short one with Frank -- wish it could have been longer.  I&#x27;m
&gt; getting one of the first of these boxes, and it will be a valuable
&gt; addition to the two Frank&#x27;s Boxes that I&#x27;m working with.
&gt; 
&gt; I haven&#x27;t reviewed the recordings yet, as I just got home.  But we got
&gt; many clear responses to questions.
