<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>New Box from Rob showed up today, the Speakjet #4.  I was planning on 
taking the day off from this, but i got sucked right back in again.  
The files are a bit rough sounding, i was moving around a lot but got 
some good files.  I&#x27;m only 2 minutes into a 8 minute session, but i 
need to eat and sleep.  I posted what i got so far, i didn&#x27;t want to 
let Rob down by getting it and not posting files from it the same day.  
That&#x27;s not my style, i appreciate him doing that for me and hope to get 
much more from it as i experiment.  Remember deadscience.com is where 
to go for more info on the speakjet boxes.
