<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rees.  When I record, I&#x27;ll ask for them.  I think your views on the subject are wonderful, 
and not in the slightest disrespectful. 

I know for me, when someone makes their transition after having lived a long, full life, it 
isn&#x27;t as hard for me to deal with because it&#x27;s just sad, not tragic (if that makes sense.)  I 
hope your great aunt and uncle are enjoying a glorious reunion!    :-)

&gt; Hello guys, &amp; gals
&gt; 
&gt; I hope everybody is having a great day, its a beatiful day in the 
&gt; Bluegrass State of Kentucky.  I just had a death in my Family, and I 
&gt; was wandering if anybody does a session today/or tonight if you could 
&gt; try to get in contact with a Mr. Charlie Clarke,(my Great Uncle) or 
&gt; Mrs. Joann Clarke(his wife has past a couple of months ago)to see if 
&gt; you can contact them.  If you do contact him can you tell him that 
&gt; Rees will be asking to speak with them tonight around 7-8pm eastern 
&gt; time.  To see if they can contact me.  They lived a long and 
&gt; wonderful life together.  So all my family is sad to see him go, but 
&gt; we know it was his time to leave, and life goes on.  He should be 
&gt; happy to be back with his wife.  (He was 83 years old)  I know 
&gt; probaly somebody here might think this is crazy, dumb or 
&gt; disrespectful, but that is my business. I think it should be easy to 
&gt; get in contact with him since he just crossed over.  Please let me 
&gt; know if you tried and any evidence you might get from him.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; 
&gt; William Rees
