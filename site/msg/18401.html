&gt;&gt; This one is 1998 too, it sweeps on it&#x27;s own, just is silent when it does,
&gt;&gt; there must be some kind of mute wire in there some place, I ordered an
&gt;&gt; antenna from ebay for it, I can&#x27;t find the old one for AM but, I still have
&gt;&gt; the long wire for it&#x27;s plastic round type antenna, do you know where the
&gt;&gt; mute wire is in this Frank?  I going to look for it, and since i don&#x27;t have
&gt;&gt; a saudering gun yet, I dare not snip anything that I can&#x27;t fix again.  I
&gt;&gt; wonder if some radio tech people knew for years about this technology, and
&gt;&gt; just kept it quiet, because why would they put in that mute anyway?

&gt;&gt;    Well, easy if you know what you&#x27;re looking for. You have to find the
&gt;&gt; tuning voltage line coming form the processor, then cut it and insert your
&gt;&gt; own tuning voltage. I didn&#x27;t even know about the mute function when I did
&gt;&gt; these, I use a different conversion method.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I have an older, made in 1998 Radio Shack home stereo that I got out of
&gt;&gt; the trash at work, that had the service manual wiht it, so I found the mute
&gt;&gt; circuit and removed the two transistors to make it sweep. Then added a push
&gt;&gt; button so the tuning button doesn&#x27;t have to be held in. Push the button in
&gt;&gt; and instant GB mode. That one collects duct too, but it&#x27;s heavy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;   Was it easy to hack?  How is it as a ghost box?  I would like to do
&gt;&gt;&gt; this one, since everything still works great, and it has those two big
&gt;&gt;&gt; speakers, I don&#x27;t go anywhere to need portable, and I have these others if i
&gt;&gt;&gt; did, how does yours sound for ghosts?  Where is the mute wire in it?  Is
&gt;&gt;&gt; there a symbol for the mute?  And which board is it on, there seem to be a
&gt;&gt;&gt; few boards in this one. Thanks, s

&gt;&gt;&gt;    Goofy google won&#x27;t show the pix,  but I have an Aiwa 3 cd system
&gt;&gt;&gt; that&#x27;s converted to a ghost box. It&#x27;s a home stereo system so not at all
&gt;&gt;&gt; portable.
