Nice work!

&gt; Well, I have some info from the peanut gallery, most is high pitched
so
&gt; many of you guys won&#x27;t understand it, signing type angel files, I
didn&#x27;t want
&gt; to  believe how a mother could kill her own child, but it seems she
did the
&gt; deed.  Seems from what the angels say, the grandma and mom Casey got
into a
&gt;  fight, Casey was mad so when the parents were gone, she put the baby
into
&gt; the  truck, and closed the lid, she may have been tied so she couldn&#x27;t
get
&gt; out and or  druged.  In one of the files, you can hear Caylee crying
for her
&gt; mama, she  stills asks for her mother, and the angels are saying, that
&gt; &quot;Christ holds the  baby&quot;  I have lots of files now, there are but a
few.  I think
&gt; the  spirit say, her mother will &quot;get life.&quot; sf
