Ok since I waited this long now you have to get the kid next door to take a picture of you on your home built bike LOL

did get another frame welded up, but set it aside due to weather, and so I 
could get these boards done. At the moment I don't have any of the newer 
boxes to use myself, but there's always EVPmaker, and the foreign language 
method.This week I'm ordering three more of the mini boards I did last 
spring. I have most of the parts I need for those, and I can make those 
systems very compact.
