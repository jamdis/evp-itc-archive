Hello Rhonda and Everyone,

I have heard my name called out loud before, bu=
t it was not an EVP situation it was after my first girlfriend died. I was =
17. She was 15. She had had her second kidney transplant a few months earli=
er and died of gas gangrene.

She died at 3:15 PM and I felt it. I knew tha=
t she had died. It is very difficult to explain, but I knew that she was go=
ne. So, it wasn't surprising to me when I got home from school and my eldes=
t sister was on the phone telling my Mother that Rena had died.

My Mother =
had moved us to Texas from Oklahoma a few months earlier. I knew that Rena =
wasn't doing good as she was before I left, but no one expected her to die.=
 She made a turn for the worse late that morning and by 3:15 she was gone. =


Late that afternoon I took the Greyhound bus back to my hometown in Oklah=
oma. When I got to my sisters house, it was around 1 am. My sister is 18 ye=
ars older than me, so I have a niece that is a year younger than me. My nie=
ce and I both heard Rena call my name and I then heard her call my name aga=
in a little later before I went to bed. That night after I had gone to slee=
p, it woke me up as I felt someone sit on the side of my bed. I knew it was=
 Rena telling me she was okay, but this was before I knew anything about th=
e paranormal, so I was a bit scared to open my eyes and see her. 

She was =
my first love and I am hoping that I will hear from her someday via EVP/ITC=
.

I consider myself very blessed to of heard her call my name and sit besi=
de me to let me know she was okay. 

Wishing everyone a wonderful weekend.
=
