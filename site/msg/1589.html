<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Steve,
I know that your post about &quot;begging for a box&quot; was directed at me. 
Frankly I am insulted, I thought we had developed a somewhat off the 
group friendship. Your response to my post to frank for a box was not 
begging but I believe that your obvious attempt at ass kissing is 
more insulting to frank than my asking for a box. it seems to me that 
you are afraid that I may get a box before you do and that for some 
reason you deserve one more than anyone else. I don&#x27;t understand that 
being you already ripped off franks design and had some one build you 
a number of boxes on your own. As far as serious evp research goes I 
have dedicated many many hours, much more than you have I&#x27;m sure to 
evp research and other forms of itc. matter of fact if anyone takes a 
look at your site the couple of dust orb pictures you have and the 
only evps I have heard are recent ones gleaned from the boxes you had 
made do not make you a dedicated seasoned pro at PI. I also remember 
not long ago you contacting me for advice and asking to join my team 
so in some way you must have recognised my professionalism. I will 
end by saying, If you want a box from frank be honest and ask like I 
did instead of trying to cuddle up next to him with your own version 
of his box and make it like you care about his feelings or protecting 
him from any annoyances. who made you the frank police anyway. steve 
just be real lets all work together and help each other do not try to 
sabotage anyone else hoping to further your own ambitions, you work 
with auto parts all day while I am doing evp research so you tell me 
who is more qualified to work with the box me or you?

I hope I didn&#x27;t piss anybody off this is just my opinion!
