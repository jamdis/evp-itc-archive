Just a single post stating that I had\n&gt; posted the files and where they could be found.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now this is the dilemma, If you do not post an announcement for each\n&gt; file and you trust that the single post announcing all the files that\n&gt; have been posted will suffice, well I don&#39;t think so!\n&gt;\n&gt; I know that most individuals here do not listen to or reply to every\n&gt; single file posted but I will usually get some comments on the better\n&gt; or more interesting ones. So far from the posting yesterday &quot;NADA&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; If anyone saw the post I wrote announcing the files I posted to the\n&gt; files section, please for my own satisfaction let me know.\n&gt;\n&gt; Otherwise I don&#39;t think the one post notice thing is gonna cut it!\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\nI I don' ge an e-mail link o he ile, I usually don' go he e on my own a ha ime.
