<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>LC, how did you plug the 469 into your Olympus? Did you just plug the
audio from the 469 headphone jack into the mic line in on your
recorder? I&#x27;ve been hesitant to try this as i didn&#x27;t want to to
overload the mic in jack on my recorder. Thanks, Bill

&gt; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; Today I modified my Radio Shack 12-469, but have some questions.  It 
&gt; was easy to do, and I instantly plugged it into my Olympus voice 
&gt; recorder and recorded off of it easily.  Now I want to pipe some 
&gt; white noise in (and ambient), as well. 
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Is the set-up in your video what has worked best for you (with the 
&gt; computer and all)?
&gt; 2) Will you tell us what free computer programs you used (I think one 
&gt; is Audacity)?
&gt; 3) What microphone and white noise generator did you use for your 
&gt; travel pack unit pictured on UFOGeek.com (posted on December 8th)?  
&gt; And can you give me a layout for the wiring of it - you know, how it 
&gt; all hooks together?  I&#x27;ll figure it out sooner or later, but I&#x27;d 
&gt; rather it be sooner!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, LC
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; &gt; I am currently putting together another video, just like my others 
&gt; &gt; showing a very practical way to use the Radio Shack Hack devices.
&gt; &gt; You probably saw my 12-469 practical use videos, now I&#x27;m going to 
&gt; be 
&gt; &gt; sharing a 12-470 practical use video.  This one is of a totally 
&gt; &gt; portable system that uses a noise generator, the hacked 12-470, a 
&gt; &gt; digital (or analog) recorder, and a microphone which gathers the 
&gt; raw 
&gt; &gt; audio sweep, white noise (or in my case a special white/pink noise 
&gt; file 
&gt; &gt; I created), and any ambient noise within a chamber.. and places 
&gt; that 
&gt; &gt; session int a .wav file.  It also includes an ear piece so you can 
&gt; &gt; hear, real time, what the digital recorder is recording (the mixer 
&gt; of 
&gt; &gt; the session sound within the chamber).
&gt; &gt; Stay tuned for that video later today....
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - Mike
