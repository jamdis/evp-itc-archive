This is going to sound crazy, but I'll keep my clicking.  I don't hear it anymore during the session.  I just like an old person when they get use to something, they will keep it.  Nothing new.  But I am in the market for a Mini Box with the crystal enhancer.  Does anybody know what the crystal enhance does?  I know that crystal have energy, but what is the enhancer?
