<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>No one has any &quot;rights&quot; on a Yahoogroup other than what the group
owner/moderators give them. Yahoogroups are international in scope. One
group I&#x27;m on has members in over 200 countries. The Constitution of the USA
doesn&#x27;t apply to Yahoogroups.

Some group owners are benevolent and will let anything go. Others are
tyrants and ban someone at the slightest whim. Most are in between. I&#x27;m on
one of the &quot;tyrant&quot; groups which maintains membership simply because it&#x27;s
the only one doing what it&#x27;s doing and it provides data the members consider
very valuable
This one is actually pretty good.

&gt;  Frank, you didnt let me post and took away my rights to do so.  You got
&gt; no room to talk about such things.
&gt;
&gt; And even as of last night you posted that you were going to leave the
&gt; board.  Yet here we are?
&gt;
&gt; Shit or get off the pot Frank!  Manke up your mind!  Do what you say and
&gt; say what you mean!  Grow some balls!  Man up!

&gt; What you don&#x27;t seem to get is that there is more to the individual than the
&gt; physical body.
&gt;
&gt; Apparently reading what one wants to hear is also problem, and seems to ge
&gt; huge problme with he these skeptics. This one convinced I&#x27;m out to form a
&gt; group of groupies, and she ignores all else.
&gt;
&gt; Guess we are not allowed to question out loud, or throw thoughts and
&gt; theories out there for the consideration and comment of others. Sorry, not
&gt; being from &quot;here&quot; I didn&#x27;t learn all the social taboos of this primitive
&gt; culture. I tried goose stepping once, it made my ankles hurt.
&gt;
&gt; I took the skeptics off moderation in a mistaken effort to be fair, but all
&gt; this does is disrupt the conversation about what these voices are, and how
&gt; to hear it and interpret it better. This group is not about how to explain
&gt; all the inconvenient truths away.
