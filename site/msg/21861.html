&gt; I agree. I always felt that &quot;collecting evidence&quot; with nothing to offer in return was treating them like a circus side show and very one-sided and arrogant. Some of them do seem to want to just communicate and that&#x27;s ok, but the attitude on our part was not good. They aren&#x27;t experiments.

&gt; &gt; I have to agree with Frank. To me, to think we are going to find definitive answers
&gt; &gt; or that we even have a right to them is a bit obnoxious and self-centered. I like that we can help people with the technology we use to communicate with spirit, but approaching it with the intent of personal gain, in knowledge or othwrwise, is pointless and arrogant. They tell me, though my radios that they love and appreciate me because I listen and I don&#x27;t demand a performance from them like some kind of flea circus.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think everyone takes this stuff way tooooooo serious, with too many
&gt; &gt; &gt; expectations. I don&#x27;t care about heavan, the afterlife, or crossing over
&gt; &gt; &gt; spirits, or getting the proof, I let &quot;them&quot; talk, and I listen. Not gonna
&gt; &gt; &gt; judge what &quot;they&quot; say, and not gonna get offended if it doesn&#x27;t fit my world
&gt; &gt; &gt; view( or lack of world view). They tell me earth is doomed, I don&#x27;t care! *Que
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be).*
&gt; &gt; &gt; **
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know anything, and I don&#x27;t wanna know anything. Everything started
&gt; &gt; &gt; from nothing, so the only true reality is nothing. Meditate on nothing--be
&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing! Nothing is everything, when you become nothing, you are everything,
&gt; &gt; &gt; you know everything. Nothing to it!
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, get that past the ego filters.
