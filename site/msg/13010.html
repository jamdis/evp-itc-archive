Chuck,

There is no need to defend your post. You asked for help with your =
paranormal issues and not with your personal life. The comments from our me=
mbers should stay within that request. 

Regards,

Frank R.

Thank you for proving =
my point in that you simply just jump the gun 
too quickly. You didnt even =
see the first paragraph of my last 
response and just quoted other ones ins=
tead.Do you really read all of 
what people say before you respond or am I =
just special? 

I said "Well, I sat down with her several times and showed =
her what 
was gathered and why I was drawing these conclusions" That means =
she 
knew about them and still continued to stay. They werent a secret and =

she knew I was using them and chose to stay and live with me anyways. 
I d=
ont refuse to accept what you say, so dont refuse to accept what I 
write. =
I wont go into this anymore with you.

I never said I was going to continue=
 this "research" at all. You 
obviously are just in a tunnel vision right n=
ow because of one thing 
and I really dont see how your closed mind can eve=
n be in this field. 
So I guess I would offer the same advice to you becaus=
e of what you 
have also shared.
