<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Susan.  I don&#x27;t know what kind of box you&#x27;ll end up with, but in the meantime, you can always do &quot;manual radio sweep.&quot;  I get some of my best results that way.  When I started doing sweep for EVP, commercially available boxes were not available.  My favorite unit so far is the Duracell KP028 crank flashlight/radio.  It might be listed as the &quot;3 in 1&quot; or something like that.  The knob is just the right size and tightness to make it easy to sweep from one end to the other.  Of course, it&#x27;s a little obnoxious to have to stop and crank it up every few minutes, but I think the results make it well worth the effort.  I&#x27;ve seen others have good success with all kinds of different radios though.  So many makes/models can work well.

I own the Paranormal Systems units and many of the Radio Shack hacks, and by comparison, this little $20 model really holds it&#x27;s own.  PLUS it would be handy in case of power outage.  I think it&#x27;s always great to have items around the house that can fulfill more than one purpose.  And so budget friendly too.  ;-)

Just a thought.....

Margaret

&gt; Hi frank, I am new to your ground and I was curious where if you have a site where you sell the boxes that you make personally.. I know that I can I buy one of the standard boxes in various places or I could make one my self... if only I was suave enough to be able to fallow the directions.. unfortunately I have never really been a direction type of person.
&gt; I have always been extra sensitive and very interested in EVP and the paranormal every since I was very little and when I heard of your boxes recently I became very excited and would love to buy one, can you point me in the right direction..
&gt; Thank you, Susan
