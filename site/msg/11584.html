<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Everyone,

I&#x27;m Becca, and I&#x27;m a new member to the group. I live in S. GA. I&#x27;m a
wife, mother of one, artist (photographer, and professional
soap-artisan). I&#x27;ve had a life long interest in the
supernatural/paranormal/occult. I&#x27;ve looked into joining a few local
paranormal groups which have sprung up this year, but thus far haven&#x27;t
entered membership level with either. Soooo, instead of just being
stagnant and doing nothing, I&#x27;m interested in putting together more
equipment/&quot;know-how&quot; from a techie standpoint of view for doing my own
investigations with family and close friends. (Pretty much all members
of my family are interested in this sort of phenomenon.) I have a very
techno-knowledgeable husband who could pretty much put together
whatever equipment we need. Of course, being that we&#x27;re pretty much a
one income family, the more we can build ourselves, lowering the cost,
the better. ;)

I have lots of side interests, background, etc. but that sorta covers
where I&#x27;m coming from.

And yes, I&#x27;m finding all this information (out &quot;there&quot;) so over
whelming!  Trying to figure out the right place to start. I do plan on
having my techie-hubby check out Frank&#x27;s schematics, because I do hear
over and over that his box is still &quot;da&#x27;bomb.&quot;  :D

Thanks!

Becca</pre>
