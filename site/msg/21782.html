Here are a couple of others, I got so many last night, even  got some 
spirit voices asking me to "call her and just talk to her to get  her into the 
light. "   I am happy she went to the  light, sorry some here didn't like it, 
but they might be just sour grapes, I'm  wishing more people would pray and 
help others over there, we all can do it  you know.  sf
