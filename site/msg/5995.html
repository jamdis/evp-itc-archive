<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello all you EVP and ITC Buffs,


 Just putting my 2 cents in the mix so to speak. Hey I have posted 
some evp&#x27;s in Ralph&#x27;s Research Folder on here for your pleasure to 
listen to. I really don&#x27;t care if anyone thinks they are fake or miss 
identified sounds. All I care about is that to me they are real and I 
did my time working on them and I don&#x27;t have to prove to any Skeptics 
that what I have is evidence of the here after. You will never 
convince them and so why bother. All I know is what I got is enough 
evidence for me. You might believe it if you were here beside me at 
the time I am getting the evidence but we can&#x27;t all be in one place 
at the same time and no one can prove it otherwise to others who 
question their validity unless they were there. Myself I believe all 
of those that post their evidence on here are not trying to decieve 
people with fake evidence. They are just sharing their experience 
with what they consider evidence for themselves and to let all of us 
hear that evidence and compare notes. If we are all believers in this 
field and are true to ouselves and this forum why do we have to prove 
anything to others who question our methods as long as we are sharing 
our experinces and getting results that we are satisfied with, to the 
group on here. It&#x27;s nice to share our thoughts and methods and 
knowledge on this subject. Whatever method works for you and you get 
results who cares what others think as long as your happy with the 
finished results is all that matters. Can I ask what radio station 
says &quot; F--k Off &quot; on it and could that be just a snippet of some 
radio station that does not go by the rules of the FCC ? What radio 
station would say &quot; Hurry dead battery &quot; and then a few minutes later 
my batteries died ? You just can&#x27;t convince a skeptic. So I say let&#x27;s
have fun with our experiments and not squabble over SKEPTICS. Let&#x27;s 
enjoy the experience of sharing and not nit picking. I enjoy all the 
stuff people are presenting with all of their posts. It&#x27;s very 
interesting. Keep up the good work all of you that love this field.
I&#x27;m just a Postal worker. I&#x27;m no Rocket Scientist and not a 
professional by any means and I sure as heck am not an expert in this 
field, but I enjoy the friendship of those who love this exciting 
field such as all of you who are representing here. I thank you all 
for your comments whether good or bad on the postings I put on here.
We have been getting some great stuff on the EVP postings as I have 
heard, so keep it up and have a great time doing it. Well enough of 
that 2 cents. If you have any questions on my EVPs just give me a 
holler. Peace to everyone and keep that info flowing. Knowldege is a 
terrible thing to waste LOL.

Regards,
Ralph the Ghost Hunter</pre>
