<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thank you Frank.  I can understand your frustration with what&#x27;s happened
(that someone would put you in that position with your job is hard to
believe!)  You began this fascinating leap into whatever realm this is and
you most probably understand it better than anyone else.

Your contributions are very important to me, and it seems like many others
in this group, as well as those of the other people with a high level of
experience, and the ideas and contributions so many others have made or will
make.  The &quot;paranormal field&quot; can&#x27;t just stop at a comfortable, accepted
point, with just human spirits defined and packaged, as Draiga pointed out.
 There&#x27;s too much out there to explore and if anything discovered is &quot;real&quot;
I think we had better know that.  Though I have to admit that I may never
fully understand what/who &quot;they&quot; are unless they come and talk to me in
person and fill me in.  And I really hope &quot;your guys&quot; are just messing with
us :), though I have my doubts sometimes with all of this education I&#x27;m
getting about &quot;sustainable management of the planet for the survival of the
human species&quot;, when we don&#x27;t even know what we have messed up fully or how
to fix it.

Ok, enough off topic stuff.  I&#x27;m so glad your still here!

- Adrienne

&gt; &gt; Yes, wow.. I don&#x27;t know what to say. I&#x27;ve belonged to the group for 3-4
&gt; &gt; days. Your reputation and experience/experiments were the main reason and
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; learned afterwards of the others with experience. I can only apologize if
&gt; &gt; my question was the straw. Thank you for explaining the history, Frank.
&gt; &gt; Sorry it&#x27;s been so wearing on you. Hope you find what you&#x27;re looking for.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, for one thing, I don&#x27;t own the group anymore. Due to one of these
&gt; &gt; &gt; incessent argurments, I had to back away from this some years ago as I
&gt; &gt; &gt; almost got fired becuase yet someone else that thought they knew so
&gt; much
&gt; &gt; &gt; more forwarded all my e-mails to my boss.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Then someone else seemed to be insinuating that I may have tampered
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; the imgaes. Very insulting. This stuff goes on an on, regardless of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; quality of voices, or the images. I have reached my saturation point.
&gt; There
&gt; &gt; &gt; seems to be nothing more to be gained by presenting anything else. Now,
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; can sympatize with Richard Roberts!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The group will continue, as there are a number of box and paranormal
&gt; &gt; &gt; experts here that are more than happy to tell everyone what this stuff
&gt; &gt; &gt; really is and how it works.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I didn&#x27;t mean to create bad any feelings.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for getting back to me. I thought I had destroyed the group
&gt; by
&gt; &gt; &gt; accident. Awful feeling!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I completely understand and am very grateful that he started this
&gt; group
&gt; &gt; &gt; and is willing to share and let share ideas and files. God forbid he
&gt; should
&gt; &gt; &gt; leave!! I&#x27;m not used to looking at video this way so it would be easy
&gt; for me
&gt; &gt; &gt; to miss a lot. I did see the Upside Down Lincoln and the face at the
&gt; end in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the second attachment of &quot;If this is the only one...&quot; I need more
&gt; practice
&gt; &gt; &gt; and a more open mind, I think. This is all so far reaching. Thank
&gt; goodness
&gt; &gt; &gt; he, especially (and the others in this group) are doing this and
&gt; sharing
&gt; &gt; &gt; these ideas. Kudos to Frank for all of his work!

&gt; &gt; &gt; speech, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not just EVP. It seems to be a normal function of our own

&gt; EVPs
&gt; &gt; &gt; from boxes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and also in music files. The ones from Evanescence are pretty
&gt; &gt; &gt; impressive in

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think most want this stuff in a neat little box, all well
&gt; &gt; &gt; defined, all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rules and protocols known, but it just won&#x27;t stay in one box,
