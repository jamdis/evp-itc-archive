It needs a program \ncalled &quot;firmware&quot; put into it before it will do anything useful. The \nchips have a program memory which comes blank when you buy \nthem.The &quot;code&quot; is the representation of what is called machine \nlanguage that tells the various parts of the microcontroller what to \ndo. In this case, I imagine it increases a voltage with a certain \npattern and then drops it down to zero, starting over again and \nrepeating at a certain rate. This would produce a repetitive sweep of \nthe radio at a certain rate when the microcontroller is hooked up to \nthe radio correctly.It wouldn&#39;t be difficult for me to write my own \nprogram to do this with a PIC microcontroller, but if someone else \nhas already done it, why bother?If I can&#39;t get my hands on the \nmachine code, I&#39;ll write some myself.ZackOn Fri, 4 Jan 2008, mllejade \nwrote:&gt; Frank, please let me know if you should, for whatever reason, \ndecide&gt; to sell that chip (to control the scan rate of the &#39;469).

I&gt; think if I used the muffled sound consistently \nthey would talk&gt; through it though, the goal being to get higher \nlevel voices, and&gt; audio. The clarifier is just a low pass filter \nthat can be adjusted--&gt; just an idea.&gt; I have some female guides that \nspeak sometimes, and&gt; there&#39;s the seven sisters that come though \nsometimes, but I don&#39;t&gt; know much about that. &gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt; &gt; &gt; To: \nEVP-ITC@: debbie@: Wed, 2&gt; Jan 2008 10:33:33 -0700Subject: Re: [EVP-\nITC] The &#39;470 mod?&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Frank, Thanks for the extra \ninstructions, it doesn&#39;t sound too&gt; difficult for me so I&#39;ll give it \na shot. &gt; &gt; By the way, I did listen&gt; to your tone control clip. \nSince I&#39;m new to this my comments are&gt; probably not &quot;worth&quot; much at \nthis point. I thought the entire clip&gt; itself was a lot smoother and \nclearer than most I&#39;ve heard so far&gt; from various sources (the mixed \nstation sounds are in smaller pieces&gt; so for someone like me it would \nbe easier to pick out the EVPs as&gt; opposed to entire words from radio \nannouncers). The short piece about&gt; 2/3 of the way through, where I&#39;m \nguessing you used a clarifier,&gt; sounded muffled to me, which makes me \nthink it would also muffle the&gt; EVPs. Definitely easier on the ears \nbut for someone inexperienced&gt; (and I seem to be the only one here!) \nit seems it would be harder to&gt; pick out the real words too.&gt; &gt; By \nthe way, in listening to the&gt; deluge of clips uploaded last night, I \ncan&#39;t help but notice that the&gt; voices are all men.
