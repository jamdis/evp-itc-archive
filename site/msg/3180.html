<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Wow Misty, that is really clear.  I think you have a good 
relationship with them to get clear files like that.  Great job and 
hope you had a good holiday.

&gt; Yeah one is from 2005, the other is from 2006 and now heres 2007. 
ran across that when I was analyzing what I recorded before work.
&gt;    
&gt;   Attaching it here I will post it to the group file section later 
when I have time (gotta turn around and work early shift so will be 
after I get home) Ill post some more from the other sessions I did 
when I get time as well.
