It was the latest in a growing \nheap of information, theories, fear=\r\ns, warnings, enlightenment and anxiety about \nthe year 2012, so perhaps it&#39;=\r\ns time I throw in my two cents. \n\nI have \nnever put much stock in the suppo=\r\nsed Mayan prophecy that 2012 will mark the end \nof the world, the end of an=\r\n era or however you want to view it. I mean, haven&#39;t \nwe been through this =\r\ncountless times? Some predicted May 5, 2000, as doomsday \nbecause the plane=\r\nts were in rough alignment. Then there was the hysteria over \nthe millenniu=\r\nm and Y2K. And of course various religious cults have named date \nafter dat=\r\ne when the world would surely end, all of which came and went without \nso m=\r\nuch as a hiccup. \n\nThe year 2012 will be no different. Yes, the \nsubject is=\r\n selling a lot of books, drawing large audiences for talk radio and \ncounti=\r\nng up lots of hits on websites, but I think that&#39;s the most drama we&#39;ll \nge=\r\nt out of 2012. It, too, will come and go without a major shift on the plane=\r\nt. \nDon&#39;t we all really know that? \n\nThose promoting the 2012 changes have =\r\n\nthrown out a wide range of possibilities for what might happen =E2=80=93 e=\r\nverything from \na literal end of the world, to dramatic social, economic, p=\r\nolitical and climatic \nupheaval, to a &quot;spiritual awakening,&quot; which, of cour=\r\nse, could mean almost \nanything.\nWhy 2012?\n\nAnd what is it based on? Primar=\r\nily, it&#39;s based on an \nancient Mayan &quot;long count&quot; calendar, carved on stone=\r\n, which according to \ncalculations ends on December 21, 2012 and marks the =\r\nend of a 5,126-year era. \nWithout a doubt, the ancient Mayans were remarkab=\r\nle mathematicians and \nastronomers, but can we really take this &quot;prophecy&quot; =\r\nseriously? First of all, \nit&#39;s not even a prophecy. It happens to be when t=\r\nheir long count calendar ends. \nWhy should that hold any significance for u=\r\ns? \n\nThe second reason \nproponents of this coming apocalypse say it is on i=\r\nts way is that in 2012 there \nwill be an alignment of sorts with the center=\r\n of our galaxy. Because the Earth \nwobbles slowly as it rotates (once about=\r\n every 26,000 years) the sun will appear \nto rise in alignment with the cen=\r\nter of the Milky Way. Interesting, yes, but \nthere seems to be no cosmologi=\r\ncal evidence of any kind that this should have an \neffect on our planet, ph=\r\nysically, socially or even spiritually. \n\nThe \nthird reason touted is that =\r\nthe sun is scheduled to be at a &quot;solar maximum&quot; in \nthat year, a time when =\r\nsun spots and solar flares are very active. This kind of \nactivity really c=\r\nan cause problems. Such activity can disable and damage \nsatellites and can=\r\n have a dramatic effect on the Earth&#39;s weather. The schedule \nis based on p=\r\nast patterns of such activity, but we have no way of knowing \nwhether it wi=\r\nll happen in 2012, and if it does how severe it might be. \n\n\nStrained Inter=\r\npretations\n\nBack to the Nostradamus documentary for a moment. As \nusual, th=\r\ne Nostradamus experts quoted a selection of his quatrains =E2=80=93 those t=\r\nhat \nfeature famine, pestilence, war, etc. =E2=80=93 and strained to tie th=\r\nem into 2012. Not \nsuccessfully, in my opinion. The world has always been p=\r\nlagued with famine, \npestilence, war and the rest of it, and I saw no quatr=\r\nain that even remotely \nindicated that what Nostradamus was talking about w=\r\nas the year \n2012.\n\nAside from the quatrains, the documentary focused mainl=\r\ny on the \nso-called &quot;Lost Book of Nostradamus, &quot; which was discovered in a =\r\nmodern \nlibrary in Rome in 1994. Dating to 1629, the manuscript, filled the=\r\n bright \nwatercolor drawings, is titled Nostradamus Vatinicia Code and has =\r\non the \ninside the name Michel de Notredame as the author. First of all, al=\r\nthough this \n&quot;lost book&quot; is thought by some to be the work of Nostradamus, =\r\nthere is no \ndefinitive proof or scholarly consensus that he was actually t=\r\nhe author; some \nexperts have serious doubts. So to make this book the plat=\r\nform for this \ndocumentary puts it on very shaky ground. \n\nAnd then the len=\r\ngths to which \nthe talking heads on the show reached and strained to connec=\r\nt the drawings to \n2012 was positively ludicrous. For example, the drawing =\r\nof a sword, held \npointing up and around which is looped a banner or scroll=\r\n (see illustration \nabove) =E2=80=93 this was interpreted as the sun&#39;s alig=\r\nnment with the galactic center in \n2012. Really? The other drawings were li=\r\nkewise twisted and mangled to fit the \ninterpretations needed for the argum=\r\nent. We all know that we can take such \nenigmatic drawings =E2=80=93 and qu=\r\natrains =E2=80=93 and interpret them to fit virtually any \nscenario that we=\r\n want. \n\nSo What Will \nHappen?\n\nWhy are some people obsessed with \n2012 (ap=\r\nart from its marketing aspects)? Why are they obsessed with apocalypse \nand=\r\n the end of the world? Why is it always seen as right around the corner? \n\n=\r\n\nI think the answer is that we both fear and want great change. As \nwonderf=\r\nul as the world can be, it is, as noted earlier, continually plagued by \nwa=\r\nr, economic difficulties, famine and climate shifts. This stuff is not new.=\r\n \nThey are continuing problems that ebb and flow on the planet. While we fe=\r\nar that \nit&#39;s going to get worse (and it certainly can get worse), at the s=\r\name \ntime we have the hope that it&#39;s going to get better. We fear the catas=\r\ntrophes of \nan apocalypse, yet we hope for that spiritual awakening that wi=\r\nll save us from \nour own human nature. \n\nI&#39;m no Nostradamus, but here&#39;s my =\r\nprediction for \n2012: the world will continue on pretty much as it has in t=\r\nhe past. There will \nbe dire problems and there will be great joys. Perhaps=\r\n some problems will get a \nbit worse than they are right now, but there wil=\r\nl be no earth-shattering \ncatastrophe. If there is a spiritual awakening, i=\r\nt won&#39;t be on a planetary or \nmass scale through some unspecified miracle, =\r\nas some hope, it will be as \nindividuals. (But that has nothing to do with =\r\n2012.) The best we can shoot for \nis that as individuals we do our best to =\r\nmake our own small fragments of the \nEarth better places.
