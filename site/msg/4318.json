I looked closer at the picture and \nthen compared it to my older 12-470.  I do see differences... no \nspeaker and the label at the bottom of the radio is different from my \n12-470.\nI have never seen an older 12-469... until now.\nThanks, LC...\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike, it looks like the older version 12-469, as there is no \nexternal \n&gt; speaker, IMHO. ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; LC\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is also someone in Colorado offering a 12-469 (ebay item # \n&gt; &gt; 160191131148) for $14.95 plus shipping.  The ad picture is of the \n&gt; older \n&gt; &gt; model 12-470 though, not the 12-469.  I know the Radio Shack \n&gt; website \n&gt; &gt; has the same mistake; they have the two pictures mixed up. Their \n12-\n&gt; 469 \n&gt; &gt; page has a picture of the older 12-470 and their 12-470 page has \na \n&gt; &gt; picture of th 12-469.\n&gt; &gt; That is probably where this person got the picture from, thinking \n&gt; it is \n&gt; &gt; correct.  If that in fact was a real &quot;older 12-470&quot; he was \nselling, \n&gt; &gt; $14.95 would be a great price since it is very hard to find any \n&gt; olde 12-\n&gt; &gt; 470 in the stores anymore.  Remember, only the older 12-470 can \nbe \n&gt; &gt; hacked, no newer 12-470 (all black case) has been hacked yet.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If someone were interested I would contact the guy and ask him to \n&gt; take \n&gt; &gt; a picture of the box. Then you would know exactly which radio he \n&gt; has on \n&gt; &gt; ebay for sale.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, a 12-469...now up to $6.49 plus $8.55 S/H.  ;)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;judy_in_hollywood&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;Ticket_to_Heaven@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey All, Just looked in at Ebay, and found, what appears to \nbe, \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; 12-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 469 radio awaiting to be Hacked by one of you!!!
