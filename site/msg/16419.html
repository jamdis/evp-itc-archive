<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>But I do not agree because you have to at least ask something in order to know they it is intelligble responses.  I have been following the Audio ITC of Debbie Caruso (www.listentothisforme.com/) and it seems like this is legitimate responses.

At times here all I hear is intelligible garbbled radio speak that people are interpreting as conversation.  As the radio scans you can easily confuse this garbled radio as messages from the beyond; however, if you get intelligent responses from some questions or conversation then you can reasonably state that it is a conversation from the beyond - as long as the conversation is enough to be able to make that claim.

To claim a binch of munged words from a series of radio stations is conversation without any real connection / q&amp;a is really stretching it I think.  Again, I am not a skeptic, but I think fashioning conversation out of garbled words from radio stations is rediculous.

&gt;  I don&#x27;t  ask questions cuzz you tend to get what you&#x27;re expecting and the
&gt; results are biased at best, and I think you can actaully create the voices
&gt; you want to hear. Then there&#x27;s the problem of somekind of deceptive entities
&gt; telling you what you want to hear, or providing false and misleading
&gt; information.
&gt; 
&gt;  It&#x27;s just like any other speech, you judge it by content and meaning. Do
&gt; they address you by name? Is it names you recognize? I prefer to rely on the
&gt; guides and others to tell me what I need to know, instead of trying to
&gt; second guess the communcations.
&gt; 
&gt;  Theres&#x27; too many wanna be experts out there that think they are wise enough
&gt; to question spirits, and other unknown entites in the usual Holywood pompus
&gt; all knowing maner that has become the hallmark of paranormal investigators.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  You have to get out of the way of the information to receive it.

&gt; &gt;  This is something I do not understand unless you ask specific questions
&gt; &gt; and get answers how can you tell this is not radio gibberish?
