it self is trying to contact you.

Yes John Edwards does talk to spirts.

I can some times hear them talking to me if they want me to. Some times th=

don't want you to see or hear them.

 I learned that when we moved in here. I didn't feel or sense anything. I

 The other houses we looked at I knew when something was there.=20

 So I went  on my marry way getting things done..... when the tiles starti=

Hubby and I started talking and decided the bathroom needed to be done fir=

 So I started taking tiles off. That night I heard someone stomping up a=

down the basement stairs. I went down stairs to stare at the basement st=
airs
making stomping noises and no one was there. So I called hubby who tol=

to tell Mikey our son to go to bed.... I told him he was upstairs slee=
ping.=20

I slept with every single light on in the house the rest of the night. I d=

Hi Christine, while I have yet to get a box, or have even figured out how =
to
get one, may I ask you a question? On occasion at night I hear someone
s=
houting my name " Mike!"  But that is it. I either hear the voice with my
m=
ind or my ear. Have yet to figure that out yet. You note that you can see
s=
pirits, but can you hear them?  I often wonder if this Jon Edwards guy or
G=
eorge Andersen are really speaking to spirits as they seem to be fishing in=

a reading, and if the customer pickis up on it, the reader says, "yes that=

is what they are tellling me".  I would think if spirits spoke to you, tha=
t
you would hear them as you would hear me speaking to you.  I am new at th=
is
stufff, and have much to learn.  Any comments about the above would be
h=
elpful.  Mike Edwards  Cary, NC

develop my gift more.
I am taking psychic development, numerology, tarot, chakras,
mediumship etc.

I have seen ghosts since I was 5.

Interested in evps. I bought the radio shack radio last night and I
hacked it. I need to know what else I need to do evps and download
them into my pc.

Thank you for the help.
