Being Catholic, my mom and my brother have both expressed concern in light of my recent experimentation with voice phenomena.  This is helpful, to say the least.\n  All my best,\n  Ursula\n\nbhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n          this is a chapter of a document written for a case of evp that was \ndefended in open court.\n\nIt puts to rest certain researchers claims of warning by the vatican \nand catholic church against evp-itc research or methods of research.\n\nas a matter of fact they support it undoubtedly.\n\nhere is the urls for the main page of the article and the page \ncontaining this chapter\n\nhttp://www.victorzammit.com/book/index.html\n\nhttp://www.victorzammit.com/book/chapter04.html\n\nBruce\n\nThe Vatican supports EVP\n\nUnknown to many Christians?Catholics, Protestants and Fundamentalists�\nthe Catholic Church has been actively positive and encouraging \ntowards investigation of the Electronic Voice Phenomena.\n\n� Two of the earliest investigators were Italian Catholic priests, \nFather Ernetti and Father Gemelli, who came upon the phenomena by \nchance while they were recording Gregorian chants in 1952. \n\n� Father Gemelli heard his own father&#39;s voice on the tape calling him \nby a childhood nick-name saying &#39;Zucchini, it is clear, don&#39;t you \nknow it is I &#39;.\n\n� Deeply troubled by Catholic teaching in regard to contact with the \ndead the two priests visited Pope Pius XII in Rome. \n\n� The Pope reassured them:\n\nDear Father Gemelli, you really need not worry about this. The \nexistence of this voice is strictly a scientific fact and has nothing \nto do with spiritism. The recorder is totally objective. It receives \nand records only sound waves from wherever they come. This experiment \nmay perhaps become the cornerstone for a building for scientific \nstudies which will strengthen people&#39;s faith in a hereafter .\n(Italian Journal Astra, June 1990 quoted Kubis and Macy, 1995: 102).\n\n� Pope Pius&#39; cousin, the Rev. Professor Dr Gebhard Frei, co-founder \nof the Jung Institute, was an internationally known parapsychologist \nwho worked closely with Raudive, a pioneer in the research. He was \nalso the President of the International Society for Catholic \nParapsychologists. He himself is on record as stating: \n\nAll that I have read and heard forces me to believe that the voices \ncome from transcendental, individual entities. Whether it suits me or \nnot, I have no right to doubt the reality of the voices (Kubris and \nMacy, 1995:104).\n\n� Dr Frie died on October 27, 1967. In November 1967 at numerous \ntaping sessions a voice giving its name as Gebhard Frei came through. \nThe voice was identified by Professor Peter Hohenwarter of the \nUniversity of Vienna as positively belonging to Dr Frei (Ostrander \nand Schroeder, 1977: 271).\n\n� Pope Paul VI was well aware of the work being done from 1959 \nonwards on the Elecronic Voices by his good friend, Swedish film \nproducer Friedrich Jurgenson, who had made a documentary film about \nhim. The Pope made Jurgenson a Knight Commander of the Order of St \nGregory in 1969 for his work (see picture left). Jurgenson wrote to \nBander, a British voice researcher:\n\nI have found a sympathetic ear for the Voice Phenomenon in the \nVatican. I have won many wonderful friends among the leading figures \nin the Holy City. Today &#39;the bridge&#39; stands firmly on its foundations \n(Ostrander and Schroeder, 1977: 264).\n\n� The Vatican also gave permission for its own priests to conduct \nresearch into the voices�Father Leo Schmid, a Swiss theologist, \ncollected more than ten thousand of them in his book When the Dead \nSpeak which was published in 1976, shortly after his death.\n\n� Another Vatican-approved researcher was Father Andreas Resch who as \nwell as conducting his own experiments began courses in \nParapsychology at the Vatican&#39;s school for priests in Rome (Kubris \nand Macy, 1995:104). \n\n� In 1970 the International Society for Catholic Parapsychologists \nheld a conference in Austria and a major part of that conference was \nconcerned with papers on the Electronic Voice Phenomena.\n\n� In England in 1972 four senior members of the Catholic hierarchy \nwere involved in the famous Pye recording studio tests conducted by \nPeter Bander.\n\n� Father Pistone, Superior of the Society of St Paul in England, said \nin an interview after the tests:\n\nI do not see anything against the teaching of the Catholic Church in \nthe Voices, they are something extra-ordinary but there is no reason \nto fear them, nor can I see any danger (Bander 1973: 132).\n\nThe Church realizes that she cannot control the evolution of science. \nHere we are dealing with a scientific phenomenon; this is progress \nand the Church is progressive. I am happy to see that representatives \nof most Churches have adopted the same attitude as we have: we \nrecognize that the subject of the Voice Phenomena stirs the \nimagination even of those who have always maintained that there could \nnever be any proof or basis for discussion on the question of life \nafter death. This book and the subsequent experiments raise serious \ndoubts, even in the minds of atheists. This alone is a good reason \nfor the Church supporting the experiments. A second reason may be \nfound in the greater flexibility of the Church since Vatican II, we \nare willing to keep an open mind on all matters which do not \ncontradict Christ&#39;s teaching (Bander 1973:103).\n\n� His excellence, Archbishop H.E. Cardinale, Apostolic Nuncio to \nBelgium, commented:\n\nNaturally it is all very mysterious, but we know the voices are there \nfor all to hear them (Bander 1973: 132).\n\n� The Right Reverend Monsignor Professor C. Pfleger commented:\n\nFacts have made us realize that between death and resurrection there \nis another realm of post-mortal existence. Christian theology has \nlittle to say about this realm (Bander 1973 : 133).\n\n� Bander&#39;s book (1973: 133) contains a photograph of the Right \nReverend Mgr. Stephen O&#39;Connor, Vicar General and Principal Roman \nCatholic Chaplain to the Royal Navy, listening to the playback of a \nrecording on which a voice had manifested claiming to be that of a \nyoung Russian naval officer known to himself who had committed \nsuicide two years earlier. Dr Raudive had recorded the message \nindependently at an earlier session.\n\n� Since the 1970s the Vatican has continued to sponsor extensive \nresearch into all areas of parapsychology including Electronic Voice \nPhenomena. \n\n� Recently Father Gino Concetti, one of the most competent \ntheologians in the Vatican, said in an interview:\n\nAccording to the modern catechism, God allows our dear departed \npersons who live in an ultra-terrestrial dimension, to send messages \nto guide us in certain difficult moments of our lives. The Church has \ndecided not to forbid any more the dialogue with the deceased with \nthe condition that these contacts are carried out with a serious \nreligious and scientific purpose (printed in the Vatican newspaper \nOsservatore Romano�cited in Sarah Estep&#39;s American Association \nElectronic VoicePhenomena, Inc Newsletter, vol 16 No, 2 1997 ) \n\nClearly, the Catholic Church realizes that science is making \nenormous, inevitable, irreversible and cumulative progress which \nnobody is in a position to stop.\n\n\n\n                         \n\r\n--0-1870679321-1198365917=:21300\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Bruce,&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;I really appreciate this text and these links.&nbsp; Being Catholic, my mom and my brother have both expressed concern in light of my recent experimentation with voice phenomena.&nbsp; This is helpful, to say the least.&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;All my best,&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Ursula&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE class=replbq style=&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid&quot;&gt;  &lt;DIV id=ygrp-text&gt;  &lt;div&gt;this is a chapter of a document written for a case of evp that was &lt;BR&gt;defended in open court.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It puts to rest certain researchers claims of warning by the vatican &lt;BR&gt;and catholic church against evp-itc\n research or methods of research.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;as a matter of fact they support it undoubtedly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;here is the urls for the main page of the article and the page &lt;BR&gt;containing this chapter&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.victorzammit.com/book/index.html&quot;&gt;http://www.victorza&lt;WBR&gt;mmit.com/&lt;WBR&gt;book/index.&lt;WBR&gt;html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.victorzammit.com/book/chapter04.html&quot;&gt;http://www.victorza&lt;WBR&gt;mmit.com/&lt;WBR&gt;book/chapter04.&lt;WBR&gt;html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bruce&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Vatican supports EVP&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unknown to many Christians?Catholic&lt;WBR&gt;s, Protestants and Fundamentalists�&lt;BR&gt;the Catholic Church has been actively positive and encouraging &lt;BR&gt;towards investigation of the Electronic Voice Phenomena.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;� Two of the earliest investigators were Italian Catholic priests, &lt;BR&gt;Father Ernetti and Father Gemelli, who came upon the phenomena by &lt;BR&gt;chance while they were recording Gregorian chants in 1952. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;� Father Gemelli heard his own father&#39;s voice on the tape calling him\n &lt;BR&gt;by a childhood nick-name saying &#39;Zucchini, it is clear, don&#39;t you &lt;BR&gt;know it is I &#39;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;� Deeply troubled by Catholic teaching in regard to contact with the &lt;BR&gt;dead the two priests visited Pope Pius XII in Rome. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;� The Pope reassured them:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dear Father Gemelli, you really need not worry about this.
