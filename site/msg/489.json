I thought they meant my rooms too dark but then they started showing me &quot;tv face like&quot; images using the feedback loop and mentioning use the tv thru evp. So one night instead of aiming the cam at the loop I aimed it towards something I had recorded on tv earlier that day. About 1-2 inches away from the screen (never use video that has people/faces already present) and later when I reviewed the recording I was shocked to see a sideways picture of one of the spirits that comes thru on evp. Once I flipped it I could see inside thier picture was a face that I didnt recognize. It was so clear it looked like someone had created it with one of those art programs.
