 the interesting thing is that this is not-and can never be- "antigravity".  it can only be decreased gravity and mis-framed time--brief stills from the future and past in our agreed-on movie......and all made possible by the cosmic drag of the spinning earth and observable ONLY IN EARTH'S ENVIRONS--no loud or brightly visible ghosts in outer space; they would require the gravitomagnetic energy created by massive spinning body (earth or other planet)  it would appear, then, that einstein was right once again and quantum mechanics misfired once again because it cannot be broadened beyond the atomic scale and must be done over.

  "...
  1. Explanation for the effective weight loss
  The rotating magnetic system develops em and Z0 charges and
  experiences the classical em and Z0 electric forces created by Earth
  so that the effective weight is reduced or increases (depending on the
  direction of rotation) as much as 35 per cent. The charging is due to
  the flow of electrons and possibly also exotic neutrinos from the rolling
  magnets to the surrounding air induced by the radial electric and Z0
  electric fields generated by the Faraday effect inducing vacuum charge
  density (not possible in Maxwell�s electrodynamics). The fact that
  critical frequencies are different for clockwise and counter clockwise
  spontaneous rotation implies that classical Z0 force and exotic neutrino..."
