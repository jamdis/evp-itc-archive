Why do you call what I say mean?=C2=A0 Is it because I hold a different opi=
nion to yours?=C2=A0 Just because I am honest about my observations of a te=
chnology does not make me 'mean', does it?

Also, even though you said you =
got "lots of 
prediction type files", it doesn't apply as any kind of proof=
 when it is talked about after the fact.=C2=A0 The predictions must be clea=
r to everyone before they happen, and not subject to misinterpretation, gen=
eralization, or vague dating.=C2=A0 (Like  nostradamus usually is).

I also=
 must point out, when I give an observation on a technique or device, it is=
 not my observation that you all argue against: rather, you attack me perso=
nally (accusing me of not posting enough EVPs, or of being mean).=C2=A0 Tha=
t's the mean part, not me.
