Awesome!!!  That was really fast and i definitely appreciate your 
charitable donation to my research.  Chatty is always good, they always 
seem to have something to tell me.  Look forward to posting a bunch of 
files and taking it on a couple road trips i have coming up.

&gt; lots of files for all of us here.  This box seems to be very &quot;chatty&quot;
&gt; for some reason.  And thats good.
