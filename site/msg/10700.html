Hi LK. I used to want to educate people like =
this, but have somewhat reached a point 
where I feel it's not worth the ti=
me and effort. Perhaps though, I will shoot her over the 
article I wrote o=
n radio sweep. It was included in the most recent AAEVP news journal and 
s=
eemed to be received well, even by those previously unopen to the idea of t=
he validity of 
this technique.
