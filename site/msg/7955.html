<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>So far--no work with the RNG, no ghost voices, and nothing that even 
resembles speech. I have a Bill chip, and even that isn&#x27;t doing 
anything, but could be my set-up. I think what I want to try is load 
an EEPROM by hand wiht the numbers for  various allophones, then use 
the RNG to access the memory, and send it to the Speakjet. So far 
though, nothing beats a box, in whatever form it&#x27;s in.

&gt; Thats the way to go, I am doing the same thing but instead of an 
RNG I am going to convert the analog signal from an emf meter to a 
digital value and then have that summed to a random number generator 
that will select from a table of the allophones.
&gt; I am using a pic developer kit as it has been way to many years 
since I wrote this kind of code.

&gt;  The code Bill sent was something he found on the web. I take it 
form Stefan that there&#x27;s a PC based software that you can just put 
the words in, or the allophones. 
&gt;  
&gt;  What I want to do now is get a PIC, program it with the allophones 
only, then use the RNG to to access the memory randomly,a nd supply 
that to the Speakjet.

&gt; Did he supply the code for the PIC?
