I don't think I have enough data  yet to make a=
ny conclusions, so I plan 
more  experiments.  Since there are different  d=
istinct claims about what the 
box or the  recorders can do, I try to make =
different  distinct experiments 
for each.

Some  people claim they can get=
 the box to tell them  things that the 
operator couldn't know, so my  "wha=
ts the object" experiment is one way to  
examine that.  Some people claim =
the boxes  can make predictions, so cataloging 
predictions  and examining =
the results can help examine  that.  If there are 
other claims, I will  tr=
y to figure experiments based on  those.
