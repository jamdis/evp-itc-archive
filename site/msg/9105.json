I still feel that taking a loss on a product is not sending  \nany meaningful message to the guy, and would only possibly prevent one sale, for every \nunit sold at a loss ... but providing a listing at a minimal fee (with no hassles of money up \nfront, going to the post office, etc.) would work great.  \n\nAgain, sorry for being Devil&#39;s Advocate.  :-(  As I posted to Bruce and Jeremy... essentially, \nI am on the same moral page with the rest of you!  \n\nMargaret\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Marlboro63@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Kay,\n&gt;  \n&gt; That was what I posted on my original idea over a week ago and I was  blasted \n&gt; about it especially that I would look like a fool that I was willing to  take \n&gt; a loss of a few bucks.  But atleast the hacking information and links  would \n&gt; have been posted on ebay for all to see.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Jeff\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; In a message dated 4/7/2008 4:58:03 P.M. Central Daylight Time,  \n&gt; psfponies@... writes:\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; I checked to see what it would cost to sell one of ebay. To list it \n&gt; it  is $1.00 for $25.00-449.00 plus 8.75% of the initial $25.00 \n&gt; ($2.19), plus  3.50% of the remaining closing value balance ($25.01 \n&gt; to  $1,000.00)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I would be willing to list the one I have plus give the  information \n&gt; on the free hacking and that fact that you can get one at  Radio \n&gt; Shack for $24.99 just to shut this guy down. At the most I would be  \n&gt; out $1.00 to not sell it!!!! Well worth it I&#39;d say.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can someone  send me the written instructions on how to hack the  12-\n&gt; 249.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kay\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) , &quot;LC  \n&gt; Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Either that, or  anyone willing to make them for $25 + shipping \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; no profit?  You could then list them just like the ones that are \n&gt; &gt; selling...so  they pull up identical to the listings that are up \n&gt; &gt; there. :)\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) ,  \n&gt; &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was thinking if someone would list a FREE DOWNLOAD of  \n&gt; &gt; instructions for the various hacks \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the Radio Shack  units, it could put an end to the business \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; sellers that are  taking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; advantage of people who are unaware that they could  probably \n&gt; hack \n&gt; &gt; the units for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves. \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen &quot;downloads&quot; of various things listed before.
