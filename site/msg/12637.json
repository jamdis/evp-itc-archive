The noise on\nthis file is not a voice, it may indeed be a piece of music, but it\nseems to have some of the phonetic qualities of speech. I think most\npeople will just hear &quot;a noise&quot; or a note of music, but if any one\nhears more let me know.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;John F&quot; &lt;jfrick45@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I got this recording while out yesterday doing recordings with my\n&gt; radio shack hack ghost box. I just posted it to my newly created\n&gt; folder titled &quot;John Frick&quot;. I have a definite thought on what it says\n&gt; but I fully realize that our perception can be colored by what we\n&gt; expect to hear (our perception can also be colored by whatever someone\n&gt; has said they hear, so please try to listen to it before reading\n&gt; others opinions on it). I would like to get as many people&#39;s\n&gt; interpretations of what this might be saying as possible. If you have\n&gt; more than one idea for what it is saying I&#39;d like to hear it. You can\n&gt; post here or email me at jfrick45@...\n&gt; \n&gt; I diminished the static before and after the voice/noise to reduce the\n&gt; irritation level of playing this multiple times. Any help with\n&gt; identification would be appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll update the file later with what words that seem most likely.\n&gt;"}
