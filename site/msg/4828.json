Any help?\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;DAna&quot; &lt;cute_blonde_n_corpus23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Now I am sure you arent aware of who I am being, noone else other \n&gt; than misty welcomed me to this group. Being I am not professional at \n&gt; e.v.p.s but yet have gone through listening to many of them from \n&gt; trustful resources, your e.v.p.s make me a bit leery. NOt trying to \n&gt; be rude, so dont go get all upset right off the bat. In your e.v.p.s, \n&gt; this one especially, alot of them sound like you, not the part where \n&gt; you asking questions, but where your dad is supposively answering \n&gt; you. NOw everyone has their own right to opinion so there is now need \n&gt; to get defensive, if all is real there would be nothing to get mad \n&gt; about. I just cant help but notice how odd it is that your e.v.p. \n&gt; questions to your father, seems to answer right away when you ask the \n&gt; question. Also, i notice that after you ask the question i hear \n&gt; something being turned on that has contains the answer to that \n&gt; question. Whether it be your dad or not. I feel its you that is \n&gt; answering, but let me tell you why i figure this.. and please you \n&gt; would like to defend you side of things that would be great, maybe i \n&gt; would be able to change my opinion on the matter. But as of now, \n&gt; e.v.p.s are usually done on the same tape that the questions are on, \n&gt; then in a rewind you can hear you and the e.v.p. but to me it sound \n&gt; like you put the e.v.p. response on another tape. i am not trying to \n&gt; start any kind of fight or be cruel, maybe i could learn something on \n&gt; behalf of how you do your work... thank you\n&gt;"}
