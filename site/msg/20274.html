<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Told Skepbitch about this one, she say it just coincidence. Guess that&#x27;s
the standard answer. I do a video of frying fish while holding a ghost box
and a voice over the radio just happens to talk about fish talking, just how
common would that be, and what&#x27;s the chances of catching that at that
moment?--Skeptic idiots! Yeah, that&#x27;ll make this go away.

 I was thinking about the fish talking, but I said nothing.

F-S
