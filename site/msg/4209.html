 After a long discussion, and at times a yelling match with Chris Moon on =
the phone...I have like zero memory for verbal stuff, basically I think it =
came down to he said-she said type deal. I could agree with some of what Mr=
 Moon said, but the bottom line is--I don't care! I have had enough of thes=
e endless pissing contests, one person telling me one thing, someone else t=
elling me something else. I'm not wise enough to tell who is telling the tr=
uth. I'm done, I'm not discussing this stuff anymore, I'm not making boxes =
anymore. I have absolutely no interest in the so called paranormal. I don't=
 sell this shit, I don't make any money, all it does eat all my time and pi=
ss me off. I'll finish this last box I'm working on, and that's it. No more=
 e-mails, no more discussion--I have had it!
 
 Mr Moon said he would be gl=
ad to come on the group and answer question--so there ya go, now is your ch=
ance. I'm not going to be the go between, nor will I participate.
