I certainly do not claim to be a braniac or a know-=\r\nit-all, as you have called me in your post.\n\n        In fact I am saying th=\r\ne opposite: I am saying that I do not know:  I am saying I do not know how =\r\nanyone can believe these 2012 predictions when all they have is stories and=\r\n questionable claims.  I don&#39;t know how they can believe this stuff when th=\r\ney actually DO have evidence that all the similar claims in the past have b=\r\neen shown to be false. I do not know why they believe this claim is any mor=\r\ne justified than all the others,\n\n        I do not know how the group can s=\r\nay on its home page &quot; It&#39;s one thing to be skeptical, it&#39;s another to ignor=\r\ne and deny all evidence.&quot;, yet it is the people who are certain of the 2012=\r\n prophecies that seem to be ignoring and denying evidence that it is only o=\r\nne more in a long line of unsupported failed predictions, not those who are=\r\n skeptical of it.\n\n        I do not know how it justifies you referring to =\r\nme as  a &quot;wanne be brianiacs claiming to know all&quot;, when the group home pag=\r\ne suggests such attacks get people banned.  I do not know how being skeptic=\r\nal of a future prophecy makes one a know it all. And I do not know how prom=\r\npting people to judge for themselves makes me a know it all. \n\n        And =\r\nI don&#39;t know why the group home page says a good argument is ok, yet you st=\r\nart name-calling offended when someone questions something you do not agree=\r\n with, or proposes a theory alternate to your own.\n\n        So call me igno=\r\nrant.  Obviously I really don&#39;t know very much at all.  \n\n        But of th=\r\ne very few things I do know, I now it is good to question, and not take eve=\r\nrything, especially prophecies, at face value.  And I know the best way to =\r\ntest a prophecy, and the people making them, is to see if they actually com=\r\ne to pass.  And I know that since no evidence can support a prophecy&#39;s trut=\r\nh until it comes to pass, and since all past end-of-world prophecies have n=\r\no evidence of their success, that those who think they know something speci=\r\nal about why 2012 is different, certainly know more than I.\n\n        And so=\r\n I hope they (or you, if you count yourself among them) will post your evid=\r\nence, and your predictions, and your dates.  And we won&#39;t have to argue abo=\r\nut it.  We can just put that person, and their predictions, and their dates=\r\n, on our calendars, and judge when the date comes, who was really acting as=\r\n a know-it-all.  \n\n        One thing I think we can all agree on:  one know=\r\ns it all.
