Kristin   Thanks for the summary...a lot of work to be sure.  I am glad you brought up the autism question and I am encouraged by you initial results.  I was actually ready to re-post my request for other researchers to help with the question.  Since I got no response from others I figured my first post was not received by the group.  I can repost if anyone is interested in helping with this research project.  Thanks again for the summary...kind of brings us and our stuff all together as a GROUP.  Ron L

Frank S: Congrats on franken out the 469 to your liking!

I did hear most of everyone's files posted: Urkle and Bruce's wer
most clear.

KATHYWEIR: Audacity is free - google it.

NATHAN: Whatever you believe is okay. Opinions make the world go
round. If you are open and want to learn more than welcome.

JULI - WHATS UP GIRL!!! I have been hanging upside down - out my
window and about to throw up a ladder and sit on my roof to get better
reception!!! I have run out of tinfoil... can you spare some?

AL from o'BAMA: I too always get contradicting answers. Just
yesterday I was cleaning my pool and listening to my 470 and I heard
them say "SHE'S USING US FOR ENTERTAINMENT" I replied that I was
trying to get experience 'hearing'. I heard THAT'S GOOD" and I also
heard "BITCH LEAVE". I apologized if they felt I was intruding and
asked if they wanted me to shut down or just the DH's wanted me too. 
I heard "BOTH" and I heard "NO DON'T". Who do I choose to listen to?
I stayed on for a bit longer - I always err on the side of positive.
If I'm looking for answers to important personal stuff.. I wouldn't
ask the box for answers. PS: I once asked if they could read my mind
and they responded with "OF COURSE NOT" and then proceeded to answer
my next question before I asked! Go figure :-)

RHONDA - Are you hearing voice girl??? I knew it! You're as crazy as
me!!! LOL... I think that's cool.

REES: I really do believe your lost session was very cool. I don't
believe it's loss was a coincidence. 

BRUCE: Cool pictures in the Photos Section. Have you ever thought
about doing a BOX session and a Photo session at the same time and see
if you could get a photograph of the person talking?? That would be
an interesting experiement.

MARGARET: Your knowledge is so emense! I am grateful you are here
with us to share. 

ANNETTE: Congrats on your son's wedding!

JOEL: The news item you posted is disturbing on so many levels. I
just pray that the universe works it out so that karma is indeed
something that these people will have to deal with. Nothing is sacred
anymore it seems...

AARON: C O N G R A T U L A T I O N S !! On your first successful
session. You're hooked and welcome aboard the crazy train ;-)

VINNIE: CONGRATS TO YOU TOO! Do you want us to call your Dave or
Vinnie? 

RON L: I asked about Austism for you and I heard :"MAN MADE" and when
I asked about vaacines I heard "YES.." I will work on trying to get
these files online. But I have so much to go through... I think I
will be listening for about a week... 

whew... i missed you all..
