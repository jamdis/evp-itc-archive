&gt;  This was from what I recorded Thursday, befeor the threat, or whatever. I don&#x27;t agree with how Chris uses the boxes, but he may hear a different level that I do, or.. I don&#x27;t hear waht he does, and he doesn&#x27;t hear what I do, but that&#x27;s pretty much the same ofr everyone. Chrsi has some &quot;cherrished&quot; theories, I guess they&#x27;d be called, about how the bopxes work, I have no idea how it works.Chris thinks the box use should be restricted, I think it should be open to all. Other than that we agree.

    Hi Frank &amp; All, I feel the same as you do, that for all those people out there that want to be able to do their own research &amp; testing, no matter what box they use or for that matter, what kind of cassette recorder w/mic they may use - in the more &quot;traditional&quot; ways to get EVP&#x27;s - that they should NOT be hindered (thru fears) from doing so. Everyone, who wants to do research/testing should be allowed to do it! I totally disagree with Chris&#x27; perceptions on this subject!  =Judy=</pre>
