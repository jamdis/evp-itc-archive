Right-and that is when you get into the cynics. They won't believe anything=
 no matter WHAT proof you present.

    True.

    Being a paranormal investigator,=
 I do understand why colleges have to be like that though. Just like when I=
 am on investigations, I have to stick to just the proven facts. I can't ju=
st believe something, as that is subjective. That doesn't mean that in my h=
ead I am not drawing my own conclusions based on what I believe, but I just=
 have to keep that part of it to myself.

    Colleges can't really teach y=
ou about unproven terms and ideologies. They can talk about them, but can't=
 really teach you them, as they haven't been proven to exist, therefore the=
re is no correct way.

    Just like paranormal investigating. There is no =
right or wrong way to do it as the field has not been proven to exist.

cience people will tell you there is no astral. The term "Astral" was coine=
d by the first people who experienced this realm. But all words were coined=
. Even words such as dog or cat. 

        Also, subconscious means below c=

   All this is besides the point though.
