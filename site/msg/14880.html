I'm not sure I understand the theory behind the manual sweeps - maybe you c=
an help?

I thought the idea behind the electronic (franks box) sweeps is t=
hat the entities are the ones selecting the proper frequencies at the prope=
r time containing the relevant words they want to express.=A0 Is that true?=


If so, then doesn't the manual sweep completely override that process, si=
nce it is you that is turning the knob, and just looking for words you pers=
onally think are relevant?

You can al=
