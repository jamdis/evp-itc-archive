Yeah, I posted this with another post. Sumra sent me a chip that I modified one of my 469's with and it works fine.

 Yeah, the guy that first made the hack was giving away a chip to control the scan rate. I don't know if it's still available. I have one of the chips, and no '469.

I'm still relatively new to building boxes and would like to know if 
it's possible to speed up the scanning a bit on a hacked RS 12-469. 

Thanks,
Sharon

most I've heard so far from various sources (the mixed station sounds 
are in smaller pieces so for someone like me it would be easier to 
pick out the EVPs as opposed to entire words from radio announcers). 
The short piece about 2/3 of the way through, where I'm guessing you 
used a clarifier, sounded muffled to me, which makes me think it 
would also muffle the EVPs. Definitely easier on the ears but for 
someone inexperienced (and I seem to be the only one here!) it seems 
it would be harder to pick out the real words too.
