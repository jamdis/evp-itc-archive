Thanks..you have a great web site there.!I was looking at your
pageshttp://=
www.realinvestigationsoftheparanormal.net/index.php?p=3D1_50_H\
aunted-Tann=
ing-SpaI found alot of background noise but did manage to
hear some of the =
evp`s.I am half way through getting operations on my
inner ear so I have a =
problem with some frequency ranges.What main
equipment are you using for ev=
p work.The reason I brought up the book
was I dont think the "field" will a=
dvance much without a firm
scientific/empirical basis.And no one has done t=
he blind testing that
McCrae has done..and published..I have a few books on=
 evp now...and this
book makes most of them look like books produced for ki=
ds..Thats the
difference..The "mere" collecting of more and more evp`s..has=
 not moved
the field anywhere since the 1970`s.And that comment is not a sl=
ight
towards people collecting evp`s.. :)But if researchers are unware what=

has been accomplished in the field by scientists, or analogies to some
of =
the reports associated with some forms of mental illness etcthen I
think th=
ey are missing out.
