We just \ncouldn&#39;t bring ourselves to do that, though. We couldn&#39;t bring ourselves \nto provoke or challenge anything, either. However, asking it politely to \ndo something - anything - did get a response once.\n\nZack\n\n\n\nOn Sat, 13 Dec 2008, Cheri Esperon wrote:\n\n&gt; It depends on what is going on.  Since the focus on the investigation is\n&gt; more than just gathering EVPs  sometimes there needs to be more\n&gt; chatter.   Actual investigations can take hours and sometimes several\n&gt; visits, so what you see on a show is maybe 8-10 hours compressed into 45\n&gt; minutes.     As far as thanking the spirits, again it depends on what is\n&gt; needed and the personality of the investigator.\n&gt;\n&gt; Researching at home is a lot different- at home you are in your comfort\n&gt; zone,  I have a residual energy that walks down my hallway, I have seen\n&gt; it a hundred times, and it never freaks me out.  But if I see something\n&gt; out on an investigation- in a strange location where I am out of my\n&gt; comfort zone, it will freak me out a little-- get the heart racing.  And\n&gt; I have been known to ask what the H-E double hockey sticks was that?\n&gt; Now I will run towards something- others instinctively  start to run\n&gt; away- again it depends the personality and experience of the\n&gt; investigator, lol and the vocabulary.\n&gt;\n&gt; In a team envvironment usually and in my opinion, hopefully, you have a\n&gt; variety of styles and personalities.  I personally think that works\n&gt; better since you never know who might attract a response.\n&gt;"}
