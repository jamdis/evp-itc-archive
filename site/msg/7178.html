 What was really wierd about this is that I was sharing this on Grass Harp=
, and an Italian "researcher" claimed he made the radio and it worked, but =
the schematic he sent was right out of the datasheet for the chip. There's =
errors in the datasheet, and if you follow it 100%, the thing won't work, a=
t all. I pointed out what I did--nicely, and never heard from the guy again=
, weird. Why the lies in this field, it's so far beyond my comprehension. I=
 run into this disinformation, twist everything around stuff almost daily. =

 
 Even with the LM3820, you can't follow the data sheet at all, it's all =
jacked up! I found an app guide for another FM chip, and they used the LM38=
20 for the AM section, that's what I went by to use that chip. The LM3820 i=
s 12 cents each, so cost was the motivating factor there. It's only disadva=
ntage is having to use an external detector stage. 
 
 The LA1135 is used i=
n the car tuner modules I like to use, so I know it's capable iof decent pe=
rformance. The datasheet show this as being voltage tuned, so it should be =
exactly what we need.
