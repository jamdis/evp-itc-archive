After driving two hours to Merida, Mexico and then back and putting down 600 pesos (about $55 dollars) it took me ten minutes to do everything UFO Geek laid out in his video for hacking the radio shack box.  Cut the right pin labeled mute.  Closed the box nicely.  Nothing.  Reopened the box...looked around...two times more...still nothing.   Not even a light or hum.  \n   \n  Until I figure the radio thing out, I am in the mean time getting nowhere (it seems) with the EVP Maker on my computer to generate EVP noise and using my hand recorder etc.   Wish I could try the radio sistem...any real geeks who can give technical suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Or maybe I should just throw away my 469 and start over.   Dont think RS will take it back.     geek-wanna-be, Ron L\n\n       \n---------------------------------\nNever miss a thing.
