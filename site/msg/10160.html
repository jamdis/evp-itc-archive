<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thank you for doing that, i figured it was worth a shot at testing.  
I didn&#x27;t set out for morse code today, i was toying with the idea of 
different sounding frequencies and through EvpMaker it sounded like 
morse code to me.  That&#x27;s when the light bulb went off for the idea.  
I&#x27;ve stopped evpmaker and for some reason that Cwget program is still 
spitting out letters.  I wonder if there is a delay if there is too 
much coming out of the speakers at one time and the program has to 
play catch up.

&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; the CW decoder gets mainly the letters E, I and T.
&gt; I also noticed that the beeps are all the same length in your file.
&gt; 
&gt; So I made a raw audio file for EVPmaker that contains three cues: 
The
&gt; &quot;dit&quot; and &quot;dah&quot; beeps, and an &quot;intra-character gap&quot;:
&gt; 
&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Stefan/Morse%
20code/morse.wav
&gt; 
&gt; The &quot;Use Cue List&quot; option must be checked in EVPmaker to use this 
file.
&gt; 
&gt; Now it sounds a bit more like actual morse code, and CwGet is able 
to
&gt; decode more letters. Perhaps some former ham operators &quot;over there&quot; 
are
&gt; able to use it... :)

&gt; &gt; Here&#x27;s the program if anybody wants to play around with it.  It 
also 
&gt; &gt; picks up stuff without playing the file through evpmaker and 
converts 
&gt; &gt; it into letters just by using the microphone on the computer.  
I&#x27;m 
&gt; &gt; going to try and figure this out later, you can also cancel out 
&gt; &gt; certain frequencies too.  It&#x27;s worth exploring into this a bit.  
For 
&gt; &gt; those who don&#x27;t get what i&#x27;m trying to do, i&#x27;m running my 
frequency 
&gt; &gt; file through evpmaker and it than sounds like morse code.  Than 
i&#x27;m 
&gt; &gt; using a program to try and convert the jumbled morse code 
sounding 
&gt; &gt; file from evpmaker into coherent messages typed on the computer 
&gt; &gt; screen.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; &gt; The program is called Cwget.  I grew up on Ham Radio, so this 
doesn&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt; sound so far fetched for me.  But sorry if i&#x27;m losing some people 
on 
&gt; &gt; this method.

&gt; &gt; p.s.  The program was too large for yahoo, so here&#x27;s a link:
