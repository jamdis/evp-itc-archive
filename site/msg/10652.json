Puck, and I was wandering how the research is going?  Is it all crack up to be, and do you really think it works?  I have listen to a couple of files from Steve, and it all sounds good.\n   \n  What I&#39;m wandering is can anybody explain in regular people terms on how does the P. Puck work.  The way I took it was that their are all types of words in the puck and spirits use those words to form sentences.  Is that correct or am I totally wrong.  Please let me know.\n   \n  Rees\n\n       \n---------------------------------\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo! Mobile.
