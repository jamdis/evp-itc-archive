Hi All,
 Here=92s my take=85or 2
cents=

 Share your files all clipped
without the garbage for other=

development and record=
s, in the case a scientific organization wants to =93hear=94
the original a=
long with the clipped, walahh you have both. And everyone is

 H=
i all,

just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I wo=
uld
suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, in
o=
rder to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can for
instan=
ce increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (including
the experim=
enter' s voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, but
not cut out i=
ndividual pieces (supposed "garbage") to make an EVPmatch
with what it "sho=
uld be". At least, the unedited version shouldalways
be provided along with=
 the edited version.

But that's only my personal opinion which I thought I=
 had to express, as
we should always be able to present our results to a cr=
itical public.
