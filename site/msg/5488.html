Bruce,

No problem, you are entitled to your perspective and opinion. I really don't see anywhere in my post, a stance being made beside my agreeing with Sumption. Since you mentioned it, I have a problem with people who consider themselves to be advanced researchers in ITC telling others that there are things you need protection from in this field. I have seen this fear mongering over the many years I have been involved with my research and the research of colleagues and associates and it has never helped anyone. Are there negative entities out there that want to influence you and distract you? Sure there are! Probably just as many who want to help you and they have been there since the beginning of each of our lives.

The rule of thumb in dealing with those negative forces is to not follow their messages. If the message is basically negative then give it no merit and carry on. No ritual needed! Now if you want credentials I can give you my "paranormal resume" and let the pissing contest begin. All you need to know about me is I know enough to know that the more I learn and experience the more I realize I have a lot to learn. Ego you say, not at all. 

Best regards,

Frank R.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] For Frank R. this is long but I think worth the read










  


    
            Frank,



Let me say at the onset this is not meant as an attack and I will not 

get into a pissing match over it, but I did feel I needed to address 

it.



I promised myself that I would not post a response to any one 

person,only to a subject in general, but I will have to break that 

promise on this one.



I think your response to the ritual protection post was egotistical, 

careless and uninformed. That was the response I would expect from a 

close minded sceptic that had no real experience in this field.



As a researcher in the paranormal in general you should know that 

there is a very real and present danger from darker entities, 

especially in the field of box research that is still in its infancy 

and our knowledge is not advanced enough using this method to be so 

hap hazard about it.



All are entitled to their own opinion as far as the way they go about 

their own research but to advise that protection from the negative 

means nothing and to do it in an open forum where there are 

impressionable new individuals that are just entering into this 

research is very careless on your part.



Some researchers here including Steve and myself among other have 

recorded files with messages that tell us that the communication 

process is being hindered at that time by what we refer to as 

"dark heads" and our spirit contacts actually use that term. they 

have also told us when asked why communication was so bad that it was 

being blocked by negative entities. 



I only one of a few that have gotten this exact communication. So 

there is a real threat from negative energy or entities.



Plus through research we have found that it is possible for entities 

to travel back and forth between our realms during an open box 

session. If you listened to numerous files Steve and I have posted 

asking our friends mike and Lisa on the other side to insure that all 

and any spirits that may have traveled through please go back and 

have gotten conformation from them every time.



If it is possible for an entity to travel through the portal that a 

box MAY produce then it stands to reason it is possible that it can 

be a dark entity.



As far as fear goes, I agree wholeheartedly, fear definitely feeds 

the negative. And that is my point. The protection ritual does not 

create a relative tangible barrier, it is simply a metaphoric symbol 

of putting your mind in the right place so as not to feed this 

negative energy.



And the protection we receive from our tech/guides on the other side 

in my belief is very real, I believe they do actually run 

interference for us as far as negativity goes and the part of the 

ritual where we invoke their help is just a form of respect and 

acknowledgement that they are constantly watching out for us.



this being said, Of course everyone will adhere to their own beliefs 

as far as this subject is concerned. I just felt that your response 

was a little strong and came more from the attitude that I also 

suffer from that is to say " negative spirit yeah bring it on"



But that is not a logical thought out approach to an existing concern.

So make the ritual available for anyone that wants to use it and the 

experienced information to go with it.



My most important concern is the welfare and teaching and eventual 

success of new researcher and this research as a whole.



Bruce
