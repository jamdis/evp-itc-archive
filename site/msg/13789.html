Yes - that is why you HAVE to remain unbiased, which is difficult, but I ca=
n do it.

    The reason is simple. I=

Ouija example) a remote PK agent could be influencing the planchette. Befor=
e ruling this out, consider that the very notion that anyone is moving anyt=
hing is problematic for many people. And spirit communication pushes the ed=
ge of the belief envelope for others. In the end, all of this is some form =
of anomalous phenomena. You could know things of which you are unaware. Con=
sider that you might be clairvoyant and not even realize it. If you were to=
 externalize this through a latent PK mechanism, bingo, you are the agent a=

ich in this example would not be true..



    I was taking advantage of th=

is required if one wishes to remove reliance on belief systems alone. This =
is what many in the field are looking for. From my own work with mediums an=
d other sensitives, I have learned the perils and the potential pitfalls wi=
th our own perceptual systems, memories and recall. All of this works again=
st us in even the most trivial experimental set up, which is unfortunate bu=
t true. This is yet one more reason to exercise caution with solely anecdot=
al experimental outcomes. You will find that independent historical validat=
ion is actualy pretty tricky, as I have said before, because it often is no=

 and that's where specifically identifying an individual gets dicey.

 I wish you all the best in your efforts, whatever path you may chose.
