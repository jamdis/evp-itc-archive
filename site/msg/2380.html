<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey folks, been reading for a long time and am finally posting. I have
a question in regards to a dream a friend had...

The dream was vague but in it a woman in her low to mid 30&#x27;s is
talking about her father who has figured out a way to run Frank&#x27;s Box
through a laptop. End of dream. When the dream was relayed to me, my
gut response was &quot;Oh! They are using the wi-fi antennae&quot;. Now, don&#x27;t
get me wrong. I&#x27;m about as technical as a shoe string but the dream
came across as a strong message. Is this even possible? 

The only real &quot;visual&quot; of the dream was as the voices are coming
through, they are showing up on the laptop as well... as if Adobe
Audition or some other sound editing program is being used in
conjunction.</pre>
