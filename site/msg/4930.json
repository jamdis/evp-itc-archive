Yes, a chip that&#39;s already been \ncoded to perform this function would be certainly be a fine find!

In \nthis \n&gt; case, I imagine it increases a voltage with a certain pattern and \nthen \n&gt; drops it down to zero, starting over again and repeating at a \ncertain \n&gt; rate. This would produce a repetitive sweep of the radio at a \ncertain rate \n&gt; when the microcontroller is hooked up to the radio correctly.\n&gt; \n&gt; It wouldn&#39;t be difficult for me to write my own program to do this \nwith a \n&gt; PIC microcontroller, but if someone else has already done it, why \nbother?\n&gt; \n&gt; If I can&#39;t get my hands on the machine code, I&#39;ll write some myself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, 4 Jan 2008, mllejade wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Frank, please let me know if you should, for whatever reason, \ndecide\n&gt; &gt; to sell that chip (to control the scan rate of the &#39;469).

I&#39;ve read the follow-ups to my initial question and being a\n&gt; &gt; layman at modifying electric apparatuses, what do you all mean by\n&gt; &gt; code?  Does one need the code and the chip in order to speed up \nthe\n&gt; &gt; scanning on a hacked &#39;469; or can one do it with simply a code, or\n&gt; &gt; the chip, alone?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Yeah, the guy that first made the hack was giving away a chip to\n&gt; &gt; control the scan rate.

Yeah, that&#39;s the\n&gt; &gt; problem with noise reduction methods, they tend to take out \nvoices. I\n&gt; &gt; think if I used the muffled sound consistently they would talk\n&gt; &gt; through it though, the goal being to get higher level voices, and\n&gt; &gt; audio. The clarifier is just a low pass filter that can be \nadjusted--\n&gt; &gt; just an idea.&gt; I have some female guides that speak sometimes, and\n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s the seven sisters that come though sometimes, but I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know much about that. &gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@: debbie@: \nWed, 2\n&gt; &gt; Jan 2008 10:33:33 -0700Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] The &#39;470 mod?&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank, Thanks for the extra instructions, it doesn&#39;t sound too\n&gt; &gt; difficult for me so I&#39;ll give it a shot. &gt; &gt; By the way, I did \nlisten\n&gt; &gt; to your tone control clip. Since I&#39;m new to this my comments are\n&gt; &gt; probably not &quot;worth&quot; much at this point. I thought the entire clip\n&gt; &gt; itself was a lot smoother and clearer than most I&#39;ve heard so far\n&gt; &gt; from various sources (the mixed station sounds are in smaller \npieces\n&gt; &gt; so for someone like me it would be easier to pick out the EVPs as\n&gt; &gt; opposed to entire words from radio announcers). The short piece \nabout\n&gt; &gt; 2/3 of the way through, where I&#39;m guessing you used a clarifier,\n&gt; &gt; sounded muffled to me, which makes me think it would also muffle \nthe\n&gt; &gt; EVPs. Definitely easier on the ears but for someone inexperienced\n&gt; &gt; (and I seem to be the only one here!) it seems it would be harder \nto\n&gt; &gt; pick out the real words too.&gt; &gt; By the way, in listening to the\n&gt; &gt; deluge of clips uploaded last night, I can&#39;t help but notice that \nthe\n&gt; &gt; voices are all men. Just curious -- is that always the case?&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&gt; &gt; Debbie Tejada&gt; &gt; &quot;Once you can accept\n&gt; &gt; the universe as matter expanding into nothing that is something,\n&gt; &gt; wearing stripes with plaid comes easy. &quot; ~Albert Einstein&gt; &gt; On \nJan\n&gt; &gt; 2, 2008, at 10:22 AM, Frank Sumption wrote:&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have\n&gt; &gt; the &#39;470, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the older one or not.
