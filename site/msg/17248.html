<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, and here is the same old crapola. Present stuff for consideration and
not one freaking comment on that, always sidetracked on how acceptable other
junk is, or who siad what, or who is pissed off today.

 Always I have to aks, why bother!? I guess so the debunker skepdicks don&#x27;t
get their way,

&gt;  I know for a fact that some of the voices out of the box, and other
&gt; methods are imagination, as they tend to change from day to as perceptions
&gt; shift. I have stuff form ten years ago that sound the same, and I aslo have
&gt; tapes from the first boxes that talk about what&#x27;s going on now. I have some
&gt; voice segments for m years ago that are also gibberish and noise.
&gt;
&gt;  I don&#x27;t need some duffus telling me how I fool myself.
