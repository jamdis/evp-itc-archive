I tell them who I am, the day, time and location. I let them know my purpose for communicating and I ask for their help.

I will see if I can ask them to speak as one, because I think you hit the nail right on the head -- I do hear them speaking over each other, half in male, half in female, so maybe things would improve like you said if they organized into one collective voice. Can they still answer questions about individuals this way, or are you limited to generalized queries?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding your statement: &quot;Quite often when a new speaker\n&gt; comes forth a bit of a training session can be heard for how they can\n&gt; speak so that my physical self can hear what is said.&quot; So by this, do you mean it&#39;s possible it takes a couple of sessions for the entity to master this new method of communication? For instance, I got my grandmother&#39; s name (among others) during Tuesday&#39;s session, but she said nothing, wouldn&#39;t answer our questions; Wednesday, she suddenly started talking and was the primary person we communicated with, even correctly answered my mother&#39;s questions about her childhood pets. Could this be because there&#39;s a learning curve involved with talking through the radio? Does it take a session or two before they &quot;get the hang of it&quot;? Or is it all dependent on my skills?\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, and wanted to say I&#39;m going out tomorrow to buy all the canned goods at the grocery store in anticipation of the nuclear winter we are about to endure... Just kidding. Hearing about all that stuff they are predicting, it does make me wonder, though, why they would go to such trouble to tell you all that again and again -- what&#39;s to gain from it? It&#39;s not stirring anybody up.\n&gt;"}
