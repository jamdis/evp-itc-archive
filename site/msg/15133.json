I recorded my first 3 plus minute recording then at abt 1 minute before I ended this....I decided to start up another recording immediatley after I stopped the first. I then recorded for 45 seconds. This evp was on the recording....after some enhancements from Audacity I cleaned it up. But STILL low audio....that sucks :) It says &quot;Death&#39;s Gonna Hurt&quot;.
