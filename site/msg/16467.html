&gt; Cool Jill I will check it out when I get time to listen. Its fine its in
&gt; mp3 format. When group gets too full of the mp3 formats then I will let
&gt; people know if they have too much up. I usually suggest if someone wants to
&gt; upload many files they use esnips.com. Or if they want to upload wav files
&gt; since its not allowed here they can use their free esnips account to do
&gt; whatever format they wish and host multiple files. Glad ya figured out how
&gt; to transfer them. I didnt know you didnt know how. Let us know if you have
&gt; any problems!

&gt; Just realized that I think my file is probably too large and is taking up
&gt; all the group&#x27;s space. If this is true, please let me know immediately and
&gt; I&#x27;ll delete the file (since I have no idea how to make it smaller).

&gt; &gt; So I finally got some motivation and figured out how to get a file from
&gt; my cassette tape to the computer. It&#x27;s in the &quot;Files&quot; area here (hopefully I
&gt; did everything correctly and according to protocol):
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I cleaned it up somewhat in Audacity, taking out all the extra radio
&gt; snippets, so what&#x27;s left is me asking for someone to say my niece&#x27;s name,
&gt; and then the four &quot;Katies&quot; that came after that. There&#x27;s even, I think, a
&gt; fifth Katie tucked in there while I&#x27;m asking, as well as the obligatory &quot;I
&gt; love you&quot; first thing after I&#x27;ve finished asking.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Some background: Got my niece and cousin to do a session with me today.
&gt; Cousin has been dragging her feet, is skeptical, and the niece just arrived
&gt; from out of town, is more openminded. I&#x27;m pleased we got someone to say her
&gt; name four times in a row, and I&#x27;m uploading it here so she can hear it back
&gt; home. So this isn&#x27;t the best file I have. Maybe now that I know how to
&gt; upload (if it worked), I can upload some of my better session happenings!
