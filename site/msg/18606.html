I can see you're not in favor of this suggestion for a more peaceful group,=
 though I don't understand why,

Is anyone else with me on this?

I expect none of us=
 like all the recent attacks, insults, accusations, 
threats, hurting of fe=
elings, and attempts to piss people off. 

Can I 
suggest we stick to the p=
urpose of the group: "the discussion, promotion, and 
developemnt of Electr=
onic Voice Phenomenon, and Instrumental Transcommunication 
methods and tec=
hnologies as used in the communication with spirit, and other 
entities."

=
And that we go with Frank's philosophy "just take the 
approach, try differ=
ent methods, see what works."

No more threats. No 
name calling, insults, =
or accusations. Just try to keep a positive group 
attitude, be open that n=
ot everyone believes what everyone else does, and that's 
ok?
