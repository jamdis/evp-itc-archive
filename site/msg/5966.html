<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce and Lisby, c&#x27;mon now. Don&#x27;t miss the point here. You can call me
names and put words in my mouth all you want but all your doing is
ignoring the discussion. 

What is the goal here? Is it to move forward in the research or not?
My points are valid. To become so defensive, concerns me. Ann offers a
great idea of posting both the raw and the altered file. I think
that&#x27;s awesome. Is that something that can be done and is everyone
willing to do it? It certainly would provide a better idea of the type
of communication coming through. Here is an example- Someone with no
prior knowledge about any of these devices decides they want to try.
Great. They hack or buy a device but then are disappointed because
what they hear sounds nothing like the clear files they hear here. So,
they quit. 

One of the reasons we post any files is for peer review. How can you
truthfully give or accept any review if the file isn&#x27;t presented raw
or at least raw in addition to the cleaned up version? We end up
hearing what the poster ensures we will hear. 

If the goal is to not be concerned with any methodology or standard
protocol, than that&#x27;s fine too. But, I would think that as
researchers, it is important. 

As for posting my files and my &quot;big mouth honey&quot; - at the very least,
please try to be adult in your comments to me. I have never said that
I am getting great communication through the hack. I have had several
sessions with the 469 and have yet to get anything that IMO is
absolute communication. However, I know my standards are high and
unless it makes any sense, I ignore it for the most part. I will post
the only file that caught my attention, for obvious reasons. I could
direct you to some of my other EVP&#x27;s but they have been captured using
the open air/DVR method and are of no consequence here. But, do not
make the mistake of thinking that because I&#x27;m not posting files means
I do not have valid intelligent input. In fact, this may make me more
objective. 

Posting the file now.

Babs

&gt; However you may feel about her personally, she still made some good
points. In retrospect I would love to hear some of Bab&#x27;s files from
her own research.Michelle, do you have any you would like to
share?Regards,Frank R.

&gt; 
&gt; Frank R., Once again pal, we are on apposing sides.As far as Babs
having many friends here Welllll??? Anyway I want to address the
subject of removing time from a file.The way I am understanding what
you mean by removing time is tocut segments of the recording out of
the file. I myself do cut out simple noise or static fragments that
are naturally occurring in the sweep of the boxfor instance the
minibox has an inherent hum or thump as it&#x27;s Creator calls it. When I
receive a response through the minibox it will go something like this
&quot;yes HUM Bruce HUM we HUM are HUM here HUM&quot;I will definitely remove
every HUM from between the words but that does not change the message
or affect the words that are spoken.I&#x27;m assuming that is what you are
talking about when you and babs mention &quot;removing time&quot;  I&#x27;m just
guessing but maybe babs is trying to insinuate that researchers here
are altering their files., If so maybe she should be looking for that
in her own back yard. There must be someone she knows for a fact that
isaltering communications. And mike please lets not turn this into a
whole big thing! Bruce

&gt; 
&gt; Very good observation Babs. Let me say that you have many friends
and associates here just for the simple fact that you have an interest
in ITC, are a researcher and a complex thinker. I think we have shown
in the past that we can have a disagreement and still remain friends.
You make a lot of good points in your post and I would like to know
who removes time from their recordings. I have never removed time from
my recordings and see no reason why anyone else would without saying
so in an accompanied post.I have limited experience with the 12-469&#x27;s
as a single piece of equipment. I have arranged mine per Mike&#x27;s,
&quot;Spiricomp&quot; design. I have 3, 12-469&#x27;s feeding a four channel mixer,
which goes into a laptop running DC6 with Soundsoap 2. Mine scan
equally spaced on the FM band. I have had pretty good results until
recently.At first the messages were pretty clear but I had a feeling I
was getting a different group than I normally have for the last few
years. When I would ask about my friends on the other side they would
tell me they will look for them. Well about 2 weeks ago the 12-469
arrangement started generating a lot of interference and feedback. I
started hearing radio static voices as I use to get with shortwave.
Not voice fragments but voices made of static (metallic and robotic).
They were breaking through the sweeping. I had a feeling someone else
was trying to force their way through. Finally the interference got so
bad I was forced to revert back to a simpler method I used before,
which is using fan noise. One of the first messages to come across was
from a familiar voice telling me and I quote, &quot;your method sucks&quot;. I
have not used the 12-469&#x27;s since because of the clear messages I have
been getting using water and fan noise. That does not mean I have
given up on the 12-469&#x27;s but I won&#x27;t use them again until I am
persuaded to by my friends on the otherside that they are willing to
use and adapt to it. To my knowledge only Misty, Laura and myself use
water for recording.Regards,Frank R.

&gt; 
&gt; Alright, you all know I&#x27;m vocal and I haven&#x27;t made any &quot;friends&quot;
herebut, if we can put that aside for a moment...Spirit communication
has been my passion since day one, a little over6 years ago. I am a
believer in the afterlife and a believer inspirits attempting to
communicate with us for a variety of reasons. Ihave spiritual beliefs
that I feel strongly about and devote much ofmy waking (and sleeping)
moments to thoughts about this field.However, I am also a researcher
and a skeptic. In order for me toallow ideas to become part of my
reality I must experiment. In orderfor me to believe something is
paranormal I HAVE to rule out all otherpossible causes. That being
said, I have some questions. My hope isthat there are some here
willing to enter into discussion with me.I have a difficult time with
many of the files here. Many times, thereis no question included in
the file. I can not determine whether ornot the &quot;reply&quot; is an
intelligent reply. Maybe this has to do withallowable file size.Some
of the files I have been able to download. (I don&#x27;t always keepmy
email settings on for this group as I get too many - lol) When Ilook
at the file I see problems. There will be complete flat linesilence
between the words. Many times the &quot;reply&quot; is also at the samedecibel
as the question askers voice. Those two things should notoccur
naturally considering the devices being used. That tells me thatthere
is manipulation of the files. Now, what is manipulation to me,may not
be manipulation to others. To me, any altering of the recordedfile
constitutes manipulation. I do not know if the reply wasintelligent or
manipulated to be intelligent. Some say that they simply remove the
&quot;no response&quot; time. I&#x27;ve beentold it can be as much as 18 seconds
removed from between words. Nowwe run into the problem of us deciding
what word fits in with thequestion. What words are being ignored? Did
we take nonsense and makesense? Did we amp every noise/word or only
what fit?I think it&#x27;s great that files are offered for peer review.
However, Ithink we have to load them untouched or at the very least,
offerexactly what was done to the entire file. Time elapsed between
words,what was amped, etc. I&#x27;d also love to see some of these sessions
videotaped with the question asker facing the camera and a second
handclock visible. Truly, we aren&#x27;t researching if we don&#x27;t have
someprotocol in place.Here is an issue I have with the RS Hacks. I
have the 469. It takesapproximately 18 seconds to scan through the AM
frequencies. Now, thetypical person would think that we can take that
18 seconds and divideit by the number of AM stations to determine how
long we are on eachstation before moving on to the next one. In that
way we coulddetermine what is impossible to be said via a radio
fragment. However,that&#x27;s not correct. The scan cycle can vary from one
frequency to thenext and of course the biggest problem is that some
stations arepicked up over multiple frequencies; AM 640 can be heard
on 630, 640,650, 660 and maybe even 670. That extends the time a great
deal. Thisis a difficult problem because it is almost impossible for
the averageperson to be able to make a determination on time this way.
I heard about the following today; An experimenter records at the
sametime every day Mon-Fri. We hear about the importance of
meditating,automatic writing, etc at the same time every day but what
we have toremember with this, is that now we are in essence tuning
into the sameradio show every day. One of my first experiments with
the 469 had mehearing this deep male voice over and over again. What
was he tryingto tell me, I wondered. Than I realized that he was
speakingapproximately every 18 seconds; every time the scan hit that
station.So, if you are removing up to 18 seconds between words, then
you arereally only recording the words from one station. This post is
IN NO WAY trying to start anything besides discussionabout some
research problems. I know that there are those who are notconcerned
with anything more than the communication itself but I thinkthat it is
of the utmost importance to attempt to factor in someprotocol in order
for this to be considered serious research at all.
