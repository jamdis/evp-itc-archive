To add to that.
   
  Kay, since starting box research this past January, 2008, I have had one close friend already tell me the responses are nothing but CB or two way radio traffic, and another close friend who is devout Catholic said that I am speaking to the devil. Go figure. 
   
  My wife listened to the recordings and says she can not hear the responses.
   
  I no longer discuss box research outside the EVP/Paranormal friendships I have.
   
  Its just like UFO's. Some people believe they exist and others believe they are military test vehicles.
   
  For the past week and a half, I have been assisting Juli in a missing person case, and have been doing the box recordings for her. I conected with the boy right away who has been missing for over a year, and the info he has given us is info only the police detectives know, as it has not been released to the press. The boy has answered every question posed to him.
   
  Either you believe in spirit contact or you do not. Some people believe in God and others do not. 
   
  It seems to me the people that do not believe in spirit contact whether through a medium, box devices or personal experiences, are those that have never had an experience.
   
  I have had a handful since my youth and adult life, and from the first one I had, I was hooked and never looked back.

      Hi Kay. Your boyfriend's opinion is one of the reasons why I put great weight on relevance 
of content in a session. For example, when I recently asked for Rees' great uncle to say 
his name, and an immediate reply of "It's Chuck Clarke" is heard (even though Rees 
referred to him as Charlie, both are nicknames for Charles) I think the odds would be quite 
astronomical of that being coincidence. Same goes for any of us asking a question, any 
question, and receiving a relevant response ... it would be highly unlikely for it to be from 
stray signals (of whatever flavor.) 

Then again, if he has trouble even hearing and/or agreeing on the content, it's going to be 
hard for you to get him to view an answer as relevant, even when it is.
