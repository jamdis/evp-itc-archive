The story is a bit misleading (my misused word \nthis week.) What I got when I went to the GHU there last year was it \nwas two lesbian lovers, and a boyfriend or husband caught them in \nthe act. But that conflicted with the &quot;mystery&quot; and romance \nsurrounding the main story of the haunitng, so it was dismissed. It \nwas the first clue I got that my boxes were being mis-used, and mis-\nrepresented to the public by this particular user, who tends to pick \nand choose the &quot;evidence&quot; that comes through, and even create what \nhe wants to hear.\n\n Thanks for the story!\n\n Frank"}
