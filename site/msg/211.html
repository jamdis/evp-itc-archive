I agree but if it is them that are not willing to talk that way then there =
is not much I can do.  I've had luck using this method.  But I think the wa=
rning has to do with skeptics.  Interestingly,  I posted this evp on a mess=
age board when I received it back in December and got a lot of slack from a=
 chic on the board.  She was the biggest Witch (a moderator too), because s=
he did not get any results herself.  I honestly don't care, who believes me=
 or not. So this could have been a warning in regards to her.   BTW, your h=
ubby will be more accepting in time, just give him time.  Bri is a lot more=
 open, especially after going to that cemetery in Ohio. Although, lol he sa=
id he would never go with me again.  He has a different belief system then =
I do, and I respect that.

My little guy was using the computer and I thought I'd meditate..=
 lol but can't find the cd I like so I turned on the radio in my room to us=
e the cd player.. it no longer works not sure why cause we rarely use it.  =
So I'm sure this is boring you.  But I got an idea to test with the radio a=
gain.  I'm bored housework is done and my little guy is using the pc so he =
doesn't need me.  

They are telling me that this method is not going to be=
 accepted by the others.  Whomever the others may be.  I had the radio betw=
een a sports broadcast and another channel.   I amplified this 50%
