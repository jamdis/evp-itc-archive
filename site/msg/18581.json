I am performing experiments, keeping an open mind, and\nconsidering all evidence I find. \n\nThe way you have been attacking me by calling me names at every turn, just\nbecause I try new things and don&#39;t always agree with your world view, is\neerily reminiscent of the way the church of old tried to suppress new\nthought and discoveries, except you&#39;re just substituting the word &#39;heretic&#39;\nwith &#39;science&#39;. and &#39;blasphemy&#39; with anything that disagrees with you.\n\nThere&#39;s an old saying:  &quot;We become that which we hate&quot;.  So far, all you&#39;ve\ndone is denounce people&#39;s efforts to try new methods and see what works.\nYou accept nothing anyone else proposes if it does not agree with you.  That\nis the realm of the extreme skeptic: the same skeptic you ridicule.\n \nYou certainly don&#39;t have to agree with my comments.  And I don&#39;t have to\nagree with yours.
