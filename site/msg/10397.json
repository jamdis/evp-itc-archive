But the end result justified  the \nmeans.  I received great contact and communication and the spirits on  the other \nside got to know better.  Better than if I just sat here and  started doing \n5-10 sessions and recording them.  Once they get to know you  it all opens up to \nyou.  Good luck.\n \nJeff\n \n \nIn a message dated 4/23/2008 12:08:12 P.M. Central Daylight Time,  \nreesclarke_69@... writes:\n\n \n \n \nI will be recording tonight.

If you  do contact him can you tell him that \n&gt; Rees will be asking to  speak with them tonight around 7-8pm eastern \n&gt; time. To see if  they can contact me. They lived a long and \n&gt; wonderful life  together. So all my family is sad to see him go, but \n&gt; we know it  was his time to leave, and life goes on. He should be \n&gt; happy to  be back with his wife. (He was 83 years old) I know \n&gt; probaly  somebody here might think this is crazy, dumb or \n&gt; disrespectful,  but that is my business. I think it should be easy to \n&gt; get in  contact with him since he just crossed over.
