<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>&quot;Hello all,

Sarah Estep, the founder of the AA-EVP and an important EVP pioneer,
 made her transition today Jan 3, 2008 at 1:11 p.m. 

 The funeral service will be held at Kalis Funeral Home, 2973 Solomons
 Island Road in Edgewater, Maryland; on Tuesday Jan 8, 2008 at 10 a.m.
 telephone 410.956.4488.

 Her daughter said that she had a smile on her face. This great 
pioneer will be deeply missed but we know that she will be happy with 
her renewed body and mind.  We wish her a exciting new life.  

If you personally knew Sarah or if she influenced you and you would
 like to say a few words about her and how she influenced you, please 
do so.  We are going to put together comments in a memorial to her.  

Thank you.

Tom and Lisa Butler

And in a later communique:

&quot;Hello all,

We just spoke with Sarah&#x27;s daughter, Becky. She told us that the 
family asks that donations be made to the AA-EVP instead of sending 
flowers to the service. The &quot;Donate&quot; page at 
http://aaevp.com/donate.htm has information about donating. Public 
support of the all volunteer Association is applied to its operation 
and services.

A card will be sent to the family in behalf of each donor.

Tom and Lisa&quot;
