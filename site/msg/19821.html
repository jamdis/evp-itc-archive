well if hes speaking to a "spirit" how do we know they feel the same sensat=
ions as we do...maybe in there mind there cold..I have a file where someone=
 says they we thirsty..which got a reply by someone else to "grab a cola" t=
his is not on a GB however its on a Digital recorder..I get evp from anythi=
ng not just GB...I also have gotten a file that said "its hot in here" i ha=
ve posted that once before..at that time it was not hot..we had the air on =
and it actually was a little chilly so just because it may not be cold in s=
outh Africa at this time (don't know) does not mean that's not how there ar=
e feeling..then you have to think what do they mean by the word "cold" are =
they speaking on the weather or there state of mind...just a thought..

For what it's worth, the file in question is unmistakable to my ears an=

Th=

Maybe Frank and I should give up. He ha=

Maybe F=
