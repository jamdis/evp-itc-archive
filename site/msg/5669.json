You \nposted, &quot;I&#39;m still giving this topic a lot of thought because I \nabsolutely BELIEVE in the power of prayer, the power of positivity, \nand the power of ritual.&quot;  \n\nBelief...  I think whatever works to keep a person from fear is the \nticket. Fear is when we hand power over to something else and become \nits slave. Your post states that you &quot;absolutely believe&quot; - that is \nyour power, mentally used by you to not succumb to fear, and thus \nremain in control. ;)\n\nI might further point out that there is something more powerful than \nbelief in my opinion, and that has been the reason behind my \npursuits.  I suggest that what a person KNOWS as truth is even better \nthan belief.  Truth is eternal and has no opposite.\n\nLC\nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robin Searcy Henson&quot; \n&lt;MudPuddleFarm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m still giving this topic a lot of thought because I absolutely \nbelieve in the power of prayer, the power of positivity, and the \npower of ritual.  When I first started recording EVP a couple of \nyears ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when it \nhappened to me I felt elated rather than frightened or distressed.  I \nwill ask again:  What physical or psychic harm is a disembodied \nentity capable of doing?  Please listen to the one EVP I&#39;ve posted on \nthis board and tell me what, if anything, you hear.  I know what I \nhear, and I consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is the \nresponse that has created the determination in me to continue \nresearching the unknown.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings.  I only want to learn as \nmuch as I can from you and the other dedicated researchers on this \nboard.  It never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in the \npast, and that&#39;s about all I can say.  I will probably use one from \nthis point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract \ngoodness.  \n&gt; \n&gt; So, thank you for this contribution.  I think the debate has been \nan excellent one, and I&#39;ve appreciated the opportunity to be \nenlightened.\n&gt; \n&gt; Robin\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----  \n&gt;   From: bhali333&lt;mailto:paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; \n&gt;   To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, January 16, 2008 8:06 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debate\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   I swore I would not get wraped up in this debate\n&gt; \n&gt;   BUT!\n&gt; \n&gt;   The reason I came up with this whole protection ritual was that \nsome \n&gt;   of the new researchers where\n&gt; \n&gt;   expressing a rational concern for negative responces that they \nwere \n&gt;   recieving through thier boxes.\n&gt; \n&gt;   The short protection ritual that I posted is not meant to quell \n&gt;   irrational histerical fear, and I agree\n&gt; \n&gt;   with rosemary that anyone suffering from such fear should rethink \n&gt;   thier involment in the paranormal research field.\n&gt; \n&gt;   that being said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal \ncomfort \n&gt;   to those new individuals that had never \n&gt; \n&gt;   expperienced spiritual negativity. And to help ease them into \n&gt;   aproaching a session eventually with confidence\n&gt; \n&gt;   and determination as well as full curiousity for all types of the \n&gt;   communication we recieve.\n&gt; \n&gt;   My initial post of the ritual file was done with the best of \n&gt;   intentions and meant to be another tool available for those who \nfelt \n&gt; \n&gt;   they needed or wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent \nprayer \n&gt;   ritual, I don&#39;t think it is really worthy of all this debate.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Use it, don&#39;t use it. It&#39;s there if you want it. Also I must say \n&gt;   there are two kinds of fear the kind that is natural and a god \n&gt; \n&gt;   given emotion for self preservation, ie the fright and flight \nreflex \n&gt;   that is an instinctive trait in all of us. Then you have the \n&gt; \n&gt;   irrational dibilitating phobic fear that can turn an individual \ninto \n&gt;   a frozen statue. That type of fear I believe is unhealthy\n&gt; \n&gt;   and should be addressed and dealt with and learned how to \nharness. I \n&gt;   also believe that anyone that harbors that type of fear \n&gt; \n&gt;   would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a case of such \n&gt;   fear it would already be present and doing a small protection \n&gt; \n&gt;   ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take it for what it \nis, \n&gt;   something to utilize in our box of tools like an emf meter.\n&gt; \n&gt;   you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the bottom of your \ntool \n&gt;   box at home that you inherited from your grandfather and have \nnever \n&gt;   used\n&gt; \n&gt;   but if you come across that odd nut that needs tightening somedsy \nyou \n&gt;   will be glad you have it.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Bruce\n&gt;"}
