<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have Audition, but loaned my monitor to daughter in-law, and Olgra very
controling when it comes to *her* computer.

 These images are the same as the ones I get in steam, towels and rugs in
the bathroom, mostly. I aslo see them in other media as well, smoke, fire,
steam, clouds, and I do not accept the suggestion that it is stupid brain
tricks.  I used to record endless hours of dark video while recording school
board meetings, the digital recorder used a hard drive to store the video
wiht a seperate sound track, no video=no sound. We were just after the
sound When I viewed the black video, it would appear to be kind of an alien
language, symbols and/or letters. Makes sense, being an alien Princess.

&gt; I&#x27;ve seen live webcast of ITC sessions where GB output is fed directly into
&gt; the mic line in on a computer running Adobe Audition with the spectragraph
&gt; running. It was really compelling to see letters and numbers, not images or
&gt; pictures, but partial words appear in the graph. At first it was I thought
&gt; it was a software glitch but it is a repeatable event. It was on LiveSciFi
&gt; which is run by Tim Wood, he also thought there was some kind of code error
&gt; but it happened on more than one webcast.
&gt;
&gt; So if anyone has Audition, just feed Box output right in your computer and
&gt; see what happens. I wanted to try it tonight but I have Audacity and the
&gt; spectragraph feature doesn&#x27;t have that shaded appearance that Audition does
&gt; so it&#x27;s not able to render images or characters, at least as far as I see
&gt; using the various settings.

&gt; &gt; I have tried numerous EVP files and short box clips and so far
&gt; &gt; nothing discernible has appeared on either program. I still have a lot of
&gt; &gt; hope though.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but I am going to try to work this in to a
&gt; &gt; session tonight!
