That leads me to question how the study was actually conducted.  Listening to the box is certainly not like listening to an EVP and I personally disagree vehemently with the people out there who call box communications EVP&#39;s!\n\nIn an EVP situation, you are listening closely for a voice to sound typically over the quiet.  A box session forces one to listen through the noise as opposed to the silence.\n\nWere these sessions recorded and listened back too or was an analysis made strictly from real time?  I do sessions all the time and I am lucky if I can pick up 35% of what comes through in real time.\n\nAnd finally, try not to be too dismayed.  An EVP &#39;expert&#39; makes their bread and butter parading their EVP techniques.  I witnessed one such expert who we all have at least heard of create an EVP.  How?  The person in question scratched their thumb nail against the recorders mic to create a sound.  This person then played back the recorder to me and pitched it down to make what this person say what was heard sound more convincing.  \n\nIf I made my money parading my EVP ability, I would discredit your box too.  Why?  Because box users are the future of ITC and paranormal research.  It is relatively cheap, vastly available, and provides instant gratuity when operating.  Who wants to sit alone in the dark talking to silence when you can hear the responses in real time?  EVP is still a valid form of communication, but ghost boxes threaten an EVP experts way to make money.  Boxes are being used more and more, especially on the television shows and public hunts.  This hurts the revenue stream for EVP experts who used to be the ones getting invited to guest star on hunts for a fee; they are now being replaced by box users.\n\nIn short, box use can be discredited by every expert and skeptic in the field.   It doesn&#39;t matter.  Ghost box use now has its place in paranormal culture and it is not going to leave it anytime soon.  Being situated in a paranormal group that is lead by a para-celebrity has put me in the unique position of visiting other groups and working with the other para-celebrities in this field quite frequently.  I can assure you that ghost boxes aren&#39;t going anywhere because the majority of these people have at least a shack hack in their paranormal arsenal.  \n\nSo let this expert discredit to his or her&#39;s hearts&#39; content.  When they publish their results, the results become public and they are on the hook for what they say at that point (which could bite them in the ass one day).  Their results will not hurt the work that you are doing today Frank, nor will what they say influence this forums core group in any way because we know the boxes work. \n\nTim\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  It&#39;s probably not kosher to post this, but I find this highly insulting to\n&gt; all of us. As usual, igonore all facts and all other methods, such as\n&gt; EVPmaker, which forms all the voices inside the computer. Ignore all phone\n&gt; EVP messages, ignore all voices heard with no electronic aids. Ignore\n&gt; messages received via turned off TV and printers--and on and on, yet they\n&gt; know all about EVP..Ignore the fact that probably thousands use boxes\n&gt; successfully.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We have conducted a few listening studies of reported radio-sweep EVP and\n&gt; the results have not been good. We have also worked with a variety of such\n&gt; devices. Based on what we know about trans-etheric influences, how EVP and\n&gt; visual forms of ITC are formed and what we know about mediumship, it is\n&gt; difficult to fit radio-sweep into any established hypothesis. Without solid\n&gt; research supporting it as producing EVP, it is impossible for us to\n&gt; recommend it or support its use. If there were double-blind studies\n&gt; conducted by experienced researchers that shows it does produce phenomena,\n&gt; we would gladly promote it as an alternative technique.\n&gt; \n&gt; We are pretty sure that, in transform EVP (ordinary recorder), the voice is\n&gt; formed in the electronics by transforming available audio-frequency noise in\n&gt; an active part of the electronics such as a transistor junction. We think\n&gt; the process is amplification of a weak telekinetic signal via stochastic\n&gt; resonance and we have found that the optimum audio-frequency signal for this\n&gt; is a chaotic one rich in voice-frequencies with many transient perturbation.\n&gt; That is our working hypothesis. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;  I can&#39;t say who this is from, cuz almost certain I&#39;d get sued. There&#39;s no\n&gt; double blind testing their BS either.

I love these so called\n&gt; &gt; experts that tell us that we can only make contact using their exact methods\n&gt; &gt; and we need to refrain from any other way of doing research because in their\n&gt; &gt; eyes were just spinning our wheels. So we can&#39;t get communication from\n&gt; &gt; modified radios and were all just hearing what we want I guess. I have heard\n&gt; &gt; it all,,&quot;I wrote a book and im an expert&quot; or &quot;believe me that wont work, I\n&gt; &gt; know cause im physic&quot;.in one ear and out the other. Everyone is an expert\n&gt; &gt; these days and most of what they say is BS. If I start hearing someone or\n&gt; &gt; something talking through my dogs butt guess what im recording it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sounds like these so called experts are just trying to deter and silence\n&gt; &gt; anything they dont agree with by doing there Scientific tests.

Their testing reveals exactly what they expectt,\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is the nature of the paranormal. Getting the results they wanted, they\n&gt; &gt; puff\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out their chests and proclaim yet another victory for science! Science\n&gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a habit of supplying exactly the results wanted by whoever is paying for\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests..\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; First, where do they find people that are somehow qualified listeners!?\n&gt; &gt; WTF\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is that S---!? It&#39;s BS, and they know it. Same old skeptic/science crap,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; except from a group that wants to be the worlds onlyest EVP authority.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure there will be articles in major paranormal mags proclaiming how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the experts thoroughly debunked the boxes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; They keep testing and getting nothing, and the rest of us keep recording\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and have no shortage of voices that others can hear, can be validated,\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gives infromation that&#39;s unknow to the listener.

I&#39;ve been kicked off groups for getting voices\n&gt; &gt; thast\n&gt; &gt; &gt; somehow were judged not ghostly enough, cuz all the experts know ghosts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can&#39;t cuss, they can barely even talk and communcate!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; They send me their stupid results thinking I&#39;m the one out there pushing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes.
