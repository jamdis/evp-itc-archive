<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am a layman expert. I&#x27;ll be glad to look at Victoria&#x27;s photos if I
can get a working link. However, 99.9 percent are camera artifacts.
And if you think you are getting *a lot* of ghost photos, then I can
pretty much assure you that 99.9 percent are not paranormal.

&gt;                    Frank is not a paranormal investigator.  He is
just a humble &quot;gifted&quot; man from Colorado who enjoys trying to record
voices.  May I suggest that you goggle spirit photo&#x27;s and see what or
who comes up, you may have better luck there.  Most of us lean towards
the audio end, not the photography so much.
