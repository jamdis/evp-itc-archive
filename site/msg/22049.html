<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I wonder where all the people went?  Do you think there are other large forums we don&#x27;t know about, besides yours and Bruce&#x27;s?  I haven&#x27;t been to Tracy&#x27;s in a while.  FaceBook is very active now, but I haven&#x27;t posted any files there or on YouTube.  Athena

&gt; For having 900 members, this board is a ghost town.  When i first joined this group in 2007, it was the only group dedicated to this and it was a rockin&#x27; forum.  
&gt; 
&gt; We used to get between 1500 to 2000 posts a month, now it gets like 15 to 20 posts a month.  Not sure what happened here.  If each member here posted twice a month, it would be like 1800 posts.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m sure that somebody has to have something to say.

&gt; &gt; Maybe I should post here - it is hard to get any feedback for my files on two other forums.  Athena

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Very crisp sound, Steve.  On the AM, I heard a woman&#x27;s voice saying &quot;We want to talk to you...&quot; at 0:23.
