Gets weirder. Even stranger none of the police scanner codes I can find onl=
ine so far seem to follow along with thier callout codes for seven. Not sur=
e if its something new they implemented or what I will ask when I get a cha=
nce. The trooper I was talking to has been on the force quite a few years b=
ut I know they have been implementing some changes on how they do things ju=
st not sure if thats one of them.

I guess police still use those codes. Emergency agencies suc=
