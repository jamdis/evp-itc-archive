will a=\r\ndvance much without a firm\nscientific/empirical basis.And no one has done t=\r\nhe blind testing that\nMcCrae has done..and published..I have a few books on=\r\n evp now...and this\nbook makes most of them look like books produced for ki=\r\nds..Thats the\ndifference..The &quot;mere&quot; collecting of more and more evp`s..has=\r\n not moved\nthe field anywhere since the 1970`s.And that comment is not a sl=\r\night\ntowards people collecting evp`s.. :)But if researchers are unware what=\r\n\nhas been accomplished in the field by scientists, or analogies to some\nof =\r\nthe reports associated with some forms of mental illness etcthen I\nthink th=\r\ney are missing out.\nMike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rick Wegrzyn &lt;ric=\r\nkwegrzyn@...&gt;
