Since doing the research, have you noticed an\nincreasein your &quot;intuitive&quot; senses? By that I mean, has your hearing\nbeenheightened to the point of hearing conversations when you are\nalone? Or seeing things more clearly spirit wise? Or am I just nuts\nand needto be committed? I had to ask. It&#39;s a very strange thing.\nThese things have beenhappening to me and I&#39;m wondering if you have\nexperienced the samething or close to it.Jeremy \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Climb to the top of the charts!
