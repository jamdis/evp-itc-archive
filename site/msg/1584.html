<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I personally think begging for a box from Frank is probably just 
pissing him off.  He will give a box to whom he feels is doing 
research on their own and deserves one being they already have a 
clientel on the other side without his help.  This is just my 
opinion and i really don&#x27;t mean to offend people, but everybody can 
try to say the right thing to persuade Frank, but he is looking for 
true researchers in ITC and not someone who just wants to have what 
nobody can make themself.  It&#x27;s just annoying seeing people everyday 
saying where&#x27;s my box?  There is plenty of research to do without it 
and capable people to build them too.  Find them and stop begging on 
this board, this is not what it is for and i&#x27;m not speaking for 
Frank in any way.  But i&#x27;d rather hear someone&#x27;s Manual sweeps or 
something through EVP maker rather than groveling with no attempt to 
do anything for themselves.  Just my take on it and i&#x27;m sorry if i 
pissed anybody off.

&gt; Give one to Bruce before me, Frank. He&#x27;s a great guy and he 
deserves  
&gt; it a lot more; he&#x27;s got more time for research and a lot of 
friends  
&gt; on the others side he wants and needs to talk to.

&gt; &gt; hey Frank,
&gt; &gt; thanks for the reply to my post. I am disabled from toxins I 
breathed
&gt; &gt; at ground zero during rescue and recovery efforts, I was a first
&gt; &gt; responder so we got the worst of it and it has left me with a 
lung
&gt; &gt; disease and two heart attacks but I&#x27;m not handicaped I have total
&gt; &gt; mobility I just have to take it easy. So as you may see I have 
alot of
&gt; &gt; time for experimenting and have been doing evp research as well 
as itc
&gt; &gt; for some time now and your box has touched a special cord with 
me it
&gt; &gt; just feels like I should have and be using one. Don&#x27;t ask me to  
&gt; &gt; explain
&gt; &gt; it&#x27;s just this wierd feeling like something is telling me you 
are  
&gt; &gt; meant
&gt; &gt; to use this tool. If you can ever see your way clear as to 
building  
&gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; for me I would be more than glad to pay for your time labor and
&gt; &gt; materials and would be forever appreciative.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; your friend
