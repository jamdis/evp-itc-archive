  Tim sent me this link.

 Either the giant comet, or The Princess&#x27;s father coming back, aka Marduke.
For the the new comers, since I started EVP &quot;they&quot; call me their &quot;Purple
Princess&quot; and claim I&#x27;m Marduke&#x27;s daughter. Could be true, or just the
colllective subconcious of man, or who knows what other possible
explanation--besides just nuts. When I first started with the box, I would
also get images forming out of steam on the bathroom window, towels, and
rugs. One of the first images was the face of Marduke with that curious
woven beard they seem to wear on the Sumerain tablets. That face stood up in
a rug right in front of me. well, more like at my feet.

The story gets pretty deep.

 Marduke is asscoiated with the winged planet aka Niburu, hence the wings in
his figures. Niburu is supposedly Planet X.


 My guys pronounce the name Mar-duke, as in Dukes of hazard.

 Yeah, nutzo. Maybe.
