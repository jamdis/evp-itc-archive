Yeah, the entities seem to like the car tuners as well. About the only
difference is the antenna input, the car tuners don&#x27;t use the ferrite rod
antenna, they use a tuned RF amplifier front end. RF=radio frequency.

&gt; There might be something to the car tuners. I had a very weird experience.
&gt; If I told a psychiatrist he would shout schizo. I think people receive
&gt; messages from their radio all the time, but in another way. That is
&gt; advertising. But I was in the car and kept pushing the different buttons for
&gt; the different radio stations. I felt like I was being communicated to. With
&gt; strange gifts, perhaps I knew when to change the station. Anyways, maybe
&gt; there is something to this. I am excited to work on my own projects when the
&gt; house is put together and I have more funds.
&gt; And Snowfire, I will pray. Thank you for your kind words.
