&gt; Hi Marie. Welcome to the group. I enjoy manual sweep tuning and 
have had some great results including direct responses using that 
method. I think when they use my name (first middle and last) 
constantly that kind of throws out the randomness idea most skeptics 
have. But usually it takes people hearing thier own names and info to 
wonder if there is more to it.

&gt; &gt; Hi i am really interested in evp/itc and have been recording
&gt; &gt; for 
&gt; &gt; aproximately 5/6 months i currently do both normal evp work
&gt; &gt; and also 
&gt; &gt; radio scanning(not franks box or radio shack hacks) but
&gt; &gt; manually 
&gt; &gt; scanning through the channels..i have been quite surprised
&gt; &gt; by the 
&gt; &gt; results that i have got.
&gt; &gt; I have video posted on youtube(screen name mazblondie) and
&gt; &gt; it would be 
&gt; &gt; excellent if anyone could give there opinions.
&gt; &gt; I have had many different theory presented to me, from
&gt; &gt; imaginationto 
&gt; &gt; plain faking it, but i can believe that it is all down to
&gt; &gt; chance!!
&gt; &gt; Hope to hear from you soon.

Hi Misty,
Thanks for the reply, i too enjoy the manual method of getting itc/evp
then again i cannot afford to get anything other than that!! But i do 
think that if i am gettting such great results using this method, 
then why change? I have such specific results...getting the wonderful 
spirits that visit me to repeat words...and they have said things to 
me that wewe to specific to just be radio chatter...including both 
mine and my fiance&#x27;s nicknames as children. (both VERY strange 
names!!!)I have had accusations that i fake it, but to be honest 
other than the fact i wouldnt know how to fake it, i have no desire 
to do so, being slightly sceptical when i started doing this, i have 
been blown away by the results i have acheived!!
As i mentioned before i have some videos on youtube(mazblondie) and 
it would be FANTASTIC if you could take a look and see what you think.
Have you been recording long?
Do you have any video;s recordings to listen to??
