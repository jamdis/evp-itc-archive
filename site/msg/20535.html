Hi Diane,

Sorry it took a day to ge=
t back to you. Yes, it is funny  the things we 
sometimes think we hear (or=
 they say? lol). I wasn't 100% sure  it was "foot in 
mouth" - maybe "food/=
put/ (something???) in mouth". That's  all. It's tough 
to call something l=
ike that but there was clearly (to me)  something being 
said that sounded =
that way between "UFO" and the laugh. Do you  hear that? I 
mean, do you he=
ar anything in between? It was in the same voice  as I heard 
it.... hmm...=
. Maybe they're messing with me  :).

Adrienne
