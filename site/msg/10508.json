Seems every time I come back on to leave a \nmessage\n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s some bickering going on. I can&#39;t leave you people for a \nminute\n&gt; &gt; without some hoopla going on LOL (just Kidding). Well how ya&#39;ll \ndoing ?\n&gt; \n&gt; There seemed to be something happening all around over the last \nfew days \n&gt; or week.  It wasn&#39;t just here.  I am on 62 Yahoogroups and almost \nall of \n&gt; them broke out in arguing and bickering at the same time. I have \nNEVER \n&gt; seen that happen! And one of my favorite area bands had some \nreally \n&gt; bizarre and unpleasant things happen at a show on Saturday night. \nAnd we \n&gt; had three earthquakes here. Some thought all of these events were \ncaused \n&gt; by the full moon.  I dunno, it was still very odd but seems to \nhave passed \n&gt; now. Lives are retue=rning to normal.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fine I hope. I have been busy with my Paranormal Group and\n&gt; &gt; investigations and Gettysburg. I was in Gettysburg over this past\n&gt; &gt; weekend and got an EVP in the Triagular Field that said &quot; Never \ntrust\n&gt; &gt; Abe Lincoln &quot; LOL must have been a Rebel soldier. I thought that \nwas\n&gt; &gt; pretty cool.\n&gt; \n&gt; It also could&#39;ve been a Union soldier who didn&#39;t like his outcome!\n&gt; \n&gt; I really want to get the chance to visit Gettysburg.  I am pretty \nsure \n&gt; Batleground, Indiana (the site of the Battle of Tippecanoe in \n1811) is \n&gt; haunted by some of the former soldiers.  I&#39;ve been to that one \nmany times \n&gt; but never tried to get any EVP there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt;"}
