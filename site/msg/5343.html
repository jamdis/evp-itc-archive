<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My opinion is that when you work with this, it becomes apparently 
clear that the responses become manipulated - meaning, they are 
intelligent and in response to questions, etc.  It becomes difficult 
to rule out other broadcasts coming through when somebody with a name 
like &quot;Rosemary Guiley&quot; hears her name come through a box.  I mean, 
what are the odds it is coincidence? ;)

&gt; Dear all,
&gt; 
&gt; From my attempts at making a quick study of EVP-ITC via use of 
boxes 
&gt; in reading your extremely informative posts and listening to posted 
&gt; files, an obvious question arises (please indulge my technical 
&gt; ignorance here):  I understand these boxes work on scanning radio 
&gt; frequencies and that boxes have been created to scan AM, FM, and 
&gt; shortwave.  What about other frequencies, e.g., walkie-talkie 
&gt; channels (public, private and government), television broadcast 
&gt; channels, and all the in-between frequencies?  In other words, 
while 
&gt; scanning, for example, an AM channel, would it not be possible for 
&gt; the radio receiver to pick up another band, let&#x27;s say, short-wave?  
&gt; The reason I&#x27;m asking is that years ago I was dictating something 
&gt; into the hand-held mic of a cheap cassette tape recorder and 
imagine 
&gt; my surprise when in playing back what I&#x27;ve just dictated, instead 
of 
&gt; hearing just my voice, I also heard in the background a two-way 
&gt; conversation between truckers using their CB radios that my cheap 
mic 
&gt; had picked up while I was recording!
&gt; 
&gt; My point is even if we&#x27;re scanning only certain frequencies, can&#x27;t 
&gt; other frequencies bleed through and if so, perhaps this may be the 
&gt; reason for some of the non-sequitor responses picked by the boxes?
&gt; 
&gt; Another question:  Astronomers use scanning devices to pick up 
&gt; signals from outer space -- are their receivors constructed on 
&gt; basically the same principles as the radio receivers in the ITC 
&gt; boxes? 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks everyone,
