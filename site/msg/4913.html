decided hell no! Ya just get sucked in, and I&#x27;m not going there.

&gt; I find this whole thing kind of humorous for some reason. Maybe 
that&#x27;s just me. Maybe if I weren&#x27;t so detached from the scene, it 
might look more serious.Chris Moon refers to &quot;public slander&quot;. Where 
has this supposedly taken place? I don&#x27;t have hours and hours to 
spend looking at everything on internet and in fact it&#x27;s tough 
sometimes just keeping up with the e-mails I get from 60 Yahoogroups 
and about 20 other groups (mostly related to amateur radio and 
photography and a small handful having to do with the 
paranormal).ZackOn Thu, 3 Jan 2008, LC Duplatt wrote:&gt;
