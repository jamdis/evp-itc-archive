Spy numbers stations, long delayed \nechoes, utilitiy transmissions, oddidites, pirate shortwave radio, \nover-the-horizon-radar and many other things.  A lot of ham operators \ndon&#39;t seem to be too interested in these things.\n\nI have thought sometimes that I was a &quot;sensitive&quot; but it&#39;s not something I \ncan control and it comes and goes with no apparent pattern.\n\nZack (W9SZ)\n\nOn Sun, 9 Dec 2007, M.A. Coletta (Mike) wrote:\n\n&gt; Greetings Ken,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am also a fellow &quot;licensed Ham Radio Operator&quot; and have been told\n&gt; by others that I am a &quot;Sensitive&quot;, which would explain much that has\n&gt; happened in my life.\n&gt; On the subject of licensed operators, I&#39;m guessing there may be many\n&gt; of us &quot;Hams&quot; who enjoy searching and exploring the world of heard &\n&gt; unheard frequencies. It is one that is wide open at the moment. That\n&gt; is why we enjoy finding and experimenting with new techniques,\n&gt; devices, and ideas. We number many more than thirty, and there&#39;s room\n&gt; for plenty more...

I too am a licensed Ham Radio\n&gt; Operator and\n&gt;&gt; am very interested in EVP,etc.  I&#39;m also a Remote Viewer,\n&gt; Sensitive, & dowser.\n&gt;&gt; My studies have taught me that these things basically work on the\n&gt; same principles.\n&gt;&gt; In Physics there&#39;s something called Quantum entanglement.  In a\n&gt; nutshell, Its the\n&gt;&gt; idea of all things being familiar & related due to their physical\n&gt; make up.  Like identical\n&gt;&gt; twins separated at birth, all things are connected and aware of one\n&gt; another, even though\n&gt;&gt; miles apart & separated for years.  Also, just as time & space\n&gt; exists in a vacuum, all\n&gt;&gt; things live forever.  Once a word is spoken or an attitude is acted\n&gt; out its effects can be\n&gt;&gt; witnessed forever, (Like dropping a pebble in water & watching the\n&gt; ripples).  When I was\n&gt;&gt; teen I overdosed on some chemically treated weed.  I had an OBE &\n&gt; saw the tunnel of\n&gt;&gt; white light thing, had the whole experience.  Ever since then I&#39;ve\n&gt; understood that we are\n&gt;&gt; multidimensional, nothing dies, it only evolves or changes energy\n&gt; forms.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; People will always shy away from & fear that which they don&#39;t\n&gt; understand.\n&gt;&gt; They try to label things as evil, good, right, & wrong.  Things are\n&gt; relative.\n&gt;&gt; Your intentions are what makes things what they are.  You will\n&gt; always find\n&gt;&gt; what you look for.  Keep up the good work, its all very interesting.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;"}
