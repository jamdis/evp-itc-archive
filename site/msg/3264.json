Another member posted that on here, \nhis name is Sum.  I was bored yesterday and bought a radio from \nradio shack and did the modification in my kitchen and only took a \nfew moments to do.  I recorded a five minute session and got some \ngood files from it, so i sent it to Sum to show him that the radio \nworked and thanked him for helping me with the mod.  He asked if he \ncould use my files on that site that he was making ghostboxhack.com  \nso i said sure.  I&#39;m just a researcher, but after yesterday i feel i \ncan do some basic stuff with electronics now.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Wow how cool is that?

I was pretty impressed myself, i have \nbeen \n&gt; &gt;   doing this for a while with several different methods and now \ni have \n&gt; &gt;   another.
