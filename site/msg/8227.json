Since I usually have just a\nfew people present during FB sessions at home and never mention\nanything before we turn on the Box it never ceases to amaze me when\nother folks hear and comment on &quot;7&quot; being repeated. I wish there was\nlonger communication around 7 being spoken but maybe it&#39;s something\nwe&#39;re supposed to realize on our own. -Bill M \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  It&#39;s more than just some symbolic number junk. The Seven are real\nentities that attempt to work with human kind on the more subtle\nlevels. A reverant approach in recommended, if one wants that kind of\ncontact, and praying the Rosary is one way to access that level.\nPersonally I prefer to avoid the religious dogma, but you can&#39;t\ncompletely throw it out either. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; In a rush?
