Seems every time I come back on to leave a message\nthere&#39;s some bickering going on. I can&#39;t leave you people for a minute \nwithout some hoopla going on LOL (just Kidding). Well how ya&#39;ll doing ?\nFine I hope. I have been busy with my Paranormal Group and \ninvestigations and Gettysburg. I was in Gettysburg over this past \nweekend and got an EVP in the Triagular Field that said &quot; Never trust \nAbe Lincoln &quot; LOL must have been a Rebel soldier. I thought that was \npretty cool. I also got a voice whispering &quot; Good Day &quot; while I was \nleaving the field. I haven&#39;t had any time to do any box research but I \njust recieved a cool device created by Bill Chappel called the &quot; \nParanormal Puck &quot; can&#39;t wait to use it. It does real time voice \ncommunication with phonetic speech and texting on the computer from \ntaking the surrounding ambient energies to create speech from the \natmosphere through the Paranormal puck that has eight sensors that \ngathers the data and converts it to speech. I think that is an accurate\ndescription of it. \n\nHey does anyone know what happened to Mike Colleta ? I haven&#39;t heard \nanything from him for awhile. He hasn&#39;t updated his website and his \nBlogtalk radio show has not been on lately either. I haven&#39;t seen any \nposts on here either. So what&#39;s up with Mike I hope he&#39;s alright ? Just\nconcerned I really liked his Blogtalk shows. \n\nFrank Sumption please don&#39;t let all of this bickering bother you. Your \na better person than that. Keep up what your doing. I look forward to \nhearing what you have to say about your work and appreciate it also. \nIgnor all the hoopla and just give us all your knowledge and thoughts \non what you love to do best and that&#39;s good enough for me and all \nothers on here that think your the best at what you do. We support you.\nI wish I was as one tenth as smart as you, I would be making all kinds \nof gadgets believe me. I&#39;m just a high school drop out with a GD from \nthe Military working in a Post office ( making some good money though \nbetter than some College Grads) glad to say. I do have a ton of Ghost \nHunting gadgets also LOL. My group calls me &quot; Inspector Gadget &quot; LOL.\nSo Frank your the reason alot of us have joined this group. So don&#39;t \nbe upset if some of the people get caught up in their own selves. Most \nof us want you here probably all of us do. It&#39;s your choice what you \ndo. I can&#39;t persuade you to stay. It won&#39;t be the same if you leave, \nyour knowledge and you will be missed. I know I&#39;ll miss ya. Even \nthough I am not here all the time I am in the background watching and \nreading all the posts. Enough of my meandering gibberish. You all take \ncare and I &#39;ll let you know how the &quot;Paranormal Puck&quot; works out. \nThanks for putting up with my long post here. Take care all.\n\nRegards,\n\nRalph the Ghost Hunter\nS.P.I.R.I.T Paranormal Investigation Team\nGhosttHostt"}
