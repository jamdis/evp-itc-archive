Wish He would, thing is He must follow what has  been written first, when 
=
He does "come in clouds" at first, He will raise the  dead, I was told by 
=
David the Tech, that it will be only the material physical  matter left fro=
m 
those Christians that died over the years, that will just  vanish from w=
here 
ever they are, He will use Holy Spirit to do this, HS is the  most po=
werful 
force in the Universe, He can be a soft as a kitten's fur, and  tou=
gher than 
molten lava! 
 
After the dead rise they will form into new  bod=
y's spirit type, but 
different then the way it is now, we who are in  body=
's now, will then be changed, 
in essence we will die, so quickly we will n=
ot  realize what happened, and 
will leave the physical world, the physical=
 body  changes, and we become a 
new physical/spirit being and we will be t=
aken into  Heaven for about 2.5 
years it would have been 3 full years our =
time, but it's  been moved up 
somewhat.
 
People left on Earth will have a=
 terrible time  here, with wars, no food, 
water, you know the rest...about=
 that time the  antichrist will step in to 
control Europe, David told me, =
the antichrist will  not get the US, Canada, 
England, Australia, or even R=
ussia, because these  countries will give him too 
hard a time.  The antich=
rist was some man born  in Spain, and is now living 
in Rome, is about 30 y=
ears old right now, and he  will come into power by 
his charm, and fool ma=
ny at first he will be a nice guy,  fooling all 
county's but the ones I me=
ntioned.
 
After a couple years he will demand to be  worshiped as God, and=
 will have 
people believe he is JC, though many will not  believe it, and =
it will be 
made to suffer without food, and water, living will  be terribl=
e for 
everything, and all except those countries I mentioned will  fall un=
der his spell.  
He will some how get a massive war started up, but  he won=
't stay in power 
very long though, because the real Jesus will then return=
  with all of us, 
must be gonna be some kind of event horizon or something=
, and  then He will  
rebuild the Earth, set up His place of residence in  =
Jerusalem, which all will 
visit, we will all have fresh new physical/spiri=
t type  body's, if you lost 
a tooth in the current body, you will have a n=
ew tooth back,  if you lost a 
limb, that limb will be back, but the new ph=
ysical/spiritual type  body's 
will be stronger, and last us, JC will be he=
re living with us for 1000  years 
our time, after that, is when He will re=
turn into the spiritual side  
again, then afterward will return a differen=
t type of person, He will become  
different in personality, and because, H=
e now must be "The Judge."    (His 
current personality is much too kind, h=
eck he is letting people into the  now if 
they are sincere with apology an=
d repent from how they acted, and are  
willing to make up for crimes done.=
  Those who are Christian now, will not  be 
in that long line in darkness,=
 now when they die, they are automatically in  
light, that's why prayers, =
and leading them toward the light now does help 
those  in darkness now to =
get "go to the light."  We hear them begging us for 
help  everyday we turn=
 on a "ghost box.")
 
This is when He judges the world, and those not  livi=
ng in light, will get 
stuck in total darkness, they will not suffer throug=
h  torture, God is not 
into the torture thing, that is lies of Church to c=
ontrol  the people for 
years, heck, God didn't even enjoy those burnt offe=
rings, that is  why He came 
to us through JC in the first place so, it wou=
ldn't happen anymore,  but 
some do not believe in what He did.  Those that=
 do evil will just  disappear as 
the Naphilim  did in the time of Noah, th=
e energy from  their spirit's just 
changed into something else or He took =
it back since He can  make evil 
change into good things too.  While we are=
 being judged, one at a  time, that 
will take a long time too, He does the=
 same thing now, that is why  the line 
of those in spirit darkness is so l=
ong, David the Tech told me, and my  son 
and grandson one day, that JC wor=
ks pretty much 24/7 taking people into the  
light, they enter, repent (say=
 they are sorry) and mean it, then He talks 
with  each person one at a tim=
e, taking about 10 minutes our time with each 
spirit,  that person's guard=
ian angel go into another room to talk, the Angel 
opens a  "book of life" =
for that spirit, and they talk about what must be 
made up over  there, the=
n the loved ones, and pets  meet up, they all go into  
another room to tal=
k about things, then that person goes to their living 
place,  given consul=
 or whatever, some even go to school again, while others 
must serve  out s=
entences in a prison but at least that prison is in the 
light, it is where=
  they get those things they need to live on, some are still 
in need of de=
veloping  a conscience, something they never developed on earth 
when they =
were  here.
 
After He is finished judging this world, I was  told He will =
get to work 
with that planet we call Jupiter!  Cool eh?   He will put wate=
r on it first 
thing, it will take many thousands of years, but  it will de=
velop into a great 
new planet to live on, I know sounds very far  fetched,=
 but this is what 
David the tech says, believe it or not!  We live  and di=
e on this planet is 
like a drop of sand in a bucket when compared  to eter=
nity.   David told me 
that "God wants family, and  only asks for our love =
and respect, when we love 
someone, we will respect that  person too."   So=
rry, I got so wordy, now you 
all can shoot me  down. <g>  sf

"Thanks for writing Frank! However, =
it  was not me who made the
