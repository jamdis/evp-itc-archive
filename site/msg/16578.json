No religion or spiritu=\r\nality supports this as a solution to any issue and believe it makes the &quot;be=\r\nyond&quot; more difficult to navigate and understand. With that being said, the =\r\napparition that is being seen and the religious rites being asked for can m=\r\nean a number of things. The most likely is she feels like she needs these t=\r\nhings to move on. She is probably fearful that her act has made her unfit f=\r\nor life beyond our world. Most likely she was Catholic if she was asking fo=\r\nr a mass (Catholics will not do this for suicides). \n\nWhat needs to happen =\r\nis she needs to be reassured that she and all other entities of God are wel=\r\ncome and expected to evolve to higher planes. When we die we only are allow=\r\ned to see and experience what we are ready for or within our comfort range.=\r\n Lets say its designed into the system (for the lack o a better description=\r\n). The only barriers to her spiritual evolution are in her mind, God and th=\r\ne afterlife is always present but is not always visible.\n\nMost likely she w=\r\nas in a bad emotional place when she was alive and was the reason for her s=\r\nuicide. That will carry on for a time until she snapps out of it. There are=\r\n always helpers with her whether she understands that or not.\n\nRegards,\n\nFr=\r\nank Ratka=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n____=\r\n____________________________\nFrom: &quot;shipsdrummer@...&quot; &lt;shipsdrummer@aol=\r\n.com&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Sat, January 9, 2010 12:39:02 PM\nSu=\r\nbject: [EVP-ITC] Hello\n\n=C2=A0 \nHello Frank,\nI am new, my name is lee and b=\r\noth me and my son have heard you on the Art Bell show.
