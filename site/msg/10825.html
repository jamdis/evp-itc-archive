<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, equipment differences (I noticed some earbuds do not pick up 
half of what headphones are good speakers do) and also what I would 
call a &quot;syncopated rhythm&quot; present with some of the messages.  That&#x27;s 
my old music training coming out of me and used to describe a spacing 
between words spelling out a message, such as a word spoken every 
other second, etc - sounds abnormal in regular conversation but with 
some of these recordings it happens quite frequently.  Maybe this is 
due to the frequency changes, which also sometimes creates sort of a 
skip:  &quot;They may (may) be able to (to) help me.&quot;

&gt; I tend to be more surprised when they hear it exactly as I do. 
Often 
&gt; its not on the &quot;clearer&quot; ones that I think everyone will hear. 
&gt; Sometimes we upload the clearest files and others dont hear it. 
That 
&gt; can be for a number of reasons. Perception and equipment being used 
&gt; for playback as well as individual hearing differs, etcetera. I 
know 
&gt; when I listen to my own files on different speakers or headphones 
the 
&gt; sound quality differs. It&#x27;s just clearer on some than others.
