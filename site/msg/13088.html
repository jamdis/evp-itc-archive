<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for your input Suzane. Im gald people are trying to help me 
with different options. I have tried esnips and after a week I wanted 
to throw esnips out the window....it took me almost 10 tries just to 
get an account without errors and tyring to make a folder was the 
same. Then uploading into the folder had various errors. Reading 
forums in esnips it states that they changed &quot;management&quot; and that 
some things weren&#x27;t running best but to be patient. I tried but I 
wansnt even able to post in the forums to ask for help. I emailed 
support 4 times without a response. I was told that esnips is good by 
some people and that they have never had trobles. As far as this 
particular clip its the first time I have saved an audio file as mp3. 
It dose play on my computer and it plays for me online but Im 
wondering if changing the format has anything to do with why it wont 
play for anyone esle.

&gt; I went into my file and checked out the clip and it shows its there 
&gt; and it dose play. the one thing i realized is it dose not show a 
time 
&gt; stamp so as far as the time i wrote down i dont know if you can see 
&gt; what i am talking about. is it possible that the file would show 
for 
&gt; me and noone else? I am new at this and its the first time i have 
&gt; uploaded a file. i will try and figure it out and maybe post it a 
&gt; second time. there are 2 accounts under norther il ghost hunting 
&gt; team. the other one was my husbands he was trying out.(N.I.G.H. T) 
and 
&gt; he still dose use sometimes. it is empty. the one with the file is 
&gt; northern il ghost hunting team. well now im rambling on and on 
again. 
&gt; anyway if its still not there please let me know and i will try it 
&gt; again.

&gt; appear 
&gt; &gt; empty to me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; weve been doing some work with the radio shack box and this one 
&gt; in 
&gt; &gt; &gt; particular is important. my husbands father died when he was 
&gt; young 
&gt; &gt; and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; his uncle was murdered a few years ago. in many box sessions he 
&gt; has 
&gt; &gt; &gt; heard the two of them saying certain key things. in this 
session 
&gt; he 
&gt; &gt; &gt; asks for comfirmation that it is him. and askes how he died. at 
&gt; 0:22 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and 0:30 you hear something. i was wondering if anyone else 
heard 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; same thing. like i said in a previous post him and i sometimes 
&gt; hear 
&gt; &gt; &gt; different words.like at 0:22. it may be a gender thing or not 
but 
&gt; at 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 0:30 we deffinately hear the same thing. i have put the file in 
&gt; &gt; &gt; my &quot;folder&quot; for anyone to hear. it is under norther il ghost 
&gt; hunting 
&gt; &gt; &gt; team. thanks everone for your time.
