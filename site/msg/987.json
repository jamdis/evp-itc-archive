I was dreading it, didn&#39;t really want to go through with it, \n&gt;but\n&gt;   as usual, not as a bad as I had imagined. We did run the box for the \n&gt;camera,\n&gt;   and &quot;they&quot; were talking, and saying names of at least some prestent. \n&gt;It&#39;s\n&gt;   hard to catch it all  live, so I hope it comes out on the video, and \n&gt;DVRs,\n&gt;   since the recordings were being done from monitor speaker on the box.\n&gt;\n&gt;   It&#39;s very hard for me to accept being the focus of this kind of \n&gt;attention,\n&gt;   but I don&#39;t see the work stopping, so guess I best get used to it.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Even my little Yorkie was fascinated, instead of being scared to death \n&gt;of\n&gt;   everything, he seemed to be very interestd in the cameras. Usually the \n&gt;dogs\n&gt;   bark and bark when someone strange comes in the house, none of them \n&gt;acted\n&gt;   thay way with this crew.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Then there&#39;s the phone wierdness, maybe realted? for the last couple \n&gt;week my\n&gt;   cell would ring about 2:30AM, blockled number, and no one on the it did \n&gt;that\n&gt;   last night, same thing. Then at about 4a, my phone rang, then my wifes \n&gt;cell\n&gt;   rang, then the house phone, all about a minute apart the last one, and \n&gt;the\n&gt;   same thing, blocked number. When it&#39;s answered, it&#39;s dead quiet.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;   _________________________________________________________________\n&gt;   i&#39;m making a difference.
