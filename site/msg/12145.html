<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have a puck.....very interesting piece of equipment,  I must say.  Mine
has actually named itself...with proper capitalization and all!  It has
come up with words it was not stocked with...What&#x27;s really cool is the set
up you can program in so that if the emf, or temp, get to whatever
threshold you set..it will take a series of three pictures, or 30 seconds
of video or audio.  I&#x27;m still in the getting to know it stage...but it is
an interesting tool for sure!

&gt; Uhhhm, I really want one, lol. All kidding aside, I do want a puck
&gt; pretty bad. For ITC work, it has a much larger vocabulary, and you can
&gt; have it save and write a log file for later review. And as always, you
&gt; can use a prg. such as Audacity to capture the session in real time.
&gt; Another huge plus about the puck is that there are I believe 9 sensors
&gt; for emf and temperature, and it has datalogging ability. That makes it
&gt; worth it right there, kindof a swiss-army knife of paranormal
&gt; instrumentation. Also if I am looking at the device right, it looks
&gt; like there is an expansion port for future upgradeability. I would
&gt; love to be able to purchase one of Bill&#x27;s &quot;research units&quot; which as I
&gt; understand it, is a puck with more sensors and goodies.
&gt;
&gt; One benefit to the ovilus is that it is handheld, but the handicaps
&gt; outweigh that benefit if you are looking for better vocabulary, emf
&gt; readings, and logfile records. I hear the next version of the ovilus
&gt; will have some of those features. I really cannot wait to get my hands
&gt; on this technology, and even moreso now after reviewing the files of
&gt; group members here who have used these devices.
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
&gt; Andy
