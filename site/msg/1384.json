It has been paranormally active all my life and am very curious \nabout who is here and why.  This box idea has shed new light on this \narea in my life, because now i can possibly piece this puzzle \ntogether.  My house was an old farm house built back in 1845 and i \nknow of 1 death in the home at least.  The attic used to house \norphans and was used as a foster home in the early 1900&#39;s.  I \ncurrently live alone and the more i learn about this field the more \ninterested i get about new items and ideas.  I have been using my FM \nsweep version of the box for about 3 weeks and the sessions get \nbetter everyday.  I started only hearing 1 word fragments, but now i \nam getting partial sentences.  I tell them on the other side to keep \ntrying at this and to try to come across the whole band to form \ncomplete sentences and not just between random fm bits.  I can hear \nthe difference, the static is actually coming across the whole band \nbut i am unable to make out the vocals yet.  But they are trying.  \nIf people are not getting the boxes to work, they just don&#39;t have \nthe patience.  I could have stopped after day 1 or day 2 after \ngetting nothing, but i didn&#39;t.  They need to get to know you and \nthey also need to learn how to speak through this device, so \npatience and practice is a key element.  It will happen, just stick \nwith it people.\n\nGreat message board by the way.  I learn more evrytime i go on \nhere.  Please check out my Mp3&#39;s on the FILES section and tell me \nwhat you think.  I haven&#39;t received a lot of feedback yet.  At least \nmaybe someone can tell me about the FM radio i&#39;m using and if i&#39;m \nheading in the right direction.\n\nThanx,\n-Steve H."}
