<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Actually, i had deleted all my previous posts from the group the 
other day.  Thanx for re-hashing this topic and keeping the 
negativity going.  I deleted my posts, because they should have been 
sent in a private e-mail and no longer felt it should be on a public 
forum.

&gt; Steve, drop it. You are wrong - as usual. If you have anything
&gt; else to say to me, say it off list - or just keep your mouth shut.
&gt; 
&gt; Your attack was unnecessary and I&#x27;m sure no one needs you to 
police  
&gt; this list.
&gt; Misty is perfectly capable of doing that.

&gt; &gt; I only said that, because you have been attacking everyone that 
has
&gt; &gt; their own opinion for weeks now. Try doing some research. All you
&gt; &gt; do is wait to pounce on the next member that asks a basic 
question.
&gt; &gt; I guess i&#x27;ll crawl back to my productive board now, where we 
actually
&gt; &gt; move forward with ideas and show our results with one another.
&gt; &gt; That&#x27;s what this board used to be like until you took it over.
