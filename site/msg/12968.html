The IPAA is run by people who have been members for a long time. It is paranormal related and fine by me. No I'm not a member of IPAA, but they have a right to post if they like as long as it does not break the rules. Nobody is making you read the posts and you don't have to click anything you don't want to.

Who is IPAA and why am I receiving this information with a link for me to click on?
 
I would prefer not to receive these kinds of invitations through this group.  I usually get enough ads as it is without getting them enclosed in messages from groups I belong to. In the past I have received invitations sent directly to my email address and read them when it is convenient for me to take EXTRA time to read them.
 
Please don't make me hesitate to open EVP-ITC messages.
 
Thank you.

Dear Friends,

Welcome to the Official IPAA Nominations site. This is a new venture
and has never been done before on this global level. This site, ANYONE
can join, it is FREE, you can showcase your work, network with others,
create projects with new friends, and of course showcase your sincere
dedicated hard work, promote yourselves, and promote your books,
movies, music, TV shows, radio shows, all your talent in the
Paranormal! Networking and helping others in a haunting or a Mufon
watch, the ideas are endless!

We are working hard to find sponsorships and unfortunately this 1st
annual event, donations are required to help offset the awards. Any
donations at $25.00 or more would be greatly appreciated.

All nominees, will become featured members. The donations are good
till Nov 7, 2009 and that's a wonderful savings and very affordable
for all to participate and enjoy ALL YOUR hard work!

Sending You All the Best from IPAA
