In #21, I used just a constant voltage regulator for the \ncharger, which works ok for the smaller batteries. This one uses the same \nregulators with current limiting. The charge current is supposed to go down \nto &quot;float&quot; level after batteries are charged to maintain the charge, so you \ndon&#39;t have to worry about disconnecting the charger.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDownload Messenger.
