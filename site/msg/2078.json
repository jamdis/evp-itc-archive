If i think of a question they answer even though i didn&#39;t \nsay anything.  But Evp&#39;s can be interpreted differently by everyone \ntoo, mostly people think they hear different things at the same time \nwhich is frustrating to get a clear answer.  I think that is what we \nare doing here on this board, to keep trying to eventually get a clear \nanswer that nobody can argue that it said that.  Better boxes, Better \ntheories and ideas on communication, we have a long way to go.  But \nthose who stay with it will get the ultimate reward and silence the \nskeptics.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;delchay2005&quot; &lt;azredant@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I will be condicting some EVP experiments next month in a very \nhaunted \n&gt; location.\n&gt; \n&gt; What does everyone think about the theory that some EVP&#39;s are \n&gt; generated by the human brain?
