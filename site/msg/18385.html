Yes, Ciao, very interesting stuff please let us  know when your new "ghost =

station 2" is complete, and if you have any files that  you would like to =

post, please do, sure that we all might like hearing what  you've received=
, 
esp. me, I'd like to get something like the Bill Chappell skype  thingie=
, he 
has no idea what he has there, he calls it a "prototype."  And  no on=
e can 
understand it, except a few people, don't know what it is, but I'd  =
like to 
have one, I can't seem to get any of the fancy boxes either, no on=

selling them i guess. sf

in the new ghost-station 2 i have continued to  i=

shortwave-receiversand shortwave-receivers<WBR>,
m=
y research tend to go more in to  the ultrasound field, with 
audioconverte=
rs and ultrasound  receivers. 
 
in the new ghost-station 2 i habe built-in=
  several modules to "scramble" 
the speech patterns and then to convert th=
e  signal in, or  
from the ultrasound in audible sound.  

another module =
is the random-storage unit, basicly a  "hardware evp maker" 
like the softw=
are from stefan bion, but it is not a real  
random scrambler, but it works=
 very nice  for me :)
 
what i also made is a "laser communication  line". =
it means, the audio 
signal, no matter what type of audio signal,  were mod=
ulated 
from a laser-transmitter and received on  the other side by a 
phot=
o-transistor on a distance from about 16  feet.
 
 
some others experiments=
 i have made with  infrared. the principle is the 
same like the laser comm=
unication line. i  have build a 
infrared-transmitteinand on the  other sid=
e a infrared-receiver. the 
results were weaker as with the  laser, but i d=
o not had to much
time to improve the  system.

 
another ghost-station 2 p=
roject is the space-station  receiver. it is a 
portable unit for receiving=
 very low frequency.  basically
it consists on 2 indipendent vlf receivers =
(the  nasa inspire receiver, and 
the bbb-4 bare back bone receiver from St=
ephen P.  McGreevy).
the 2 audio signals can be mixed together or  remain a=
lone. on the output 
it has a squelch. the audio output is only  active whe=
n a 
signal will be received. the audio signals  will be routed from the 
i=
nternal mixer to a integrated fm transmitter and the  signal can be 
receiv=
ed on a normal radio some feet  away.
the main idea is: trying to receive t=
he hiss, clicks  and other atmospheric 
natural sounds and then, with speci=
alized  software
on a pc, trying to time stretch, time pitch or  resampling=
 the 
audiosignals. after that, filtering the recording and  then, if i can=
 hear some
voices i had a relativ certainty that here is  something "parano=
rmal"v
 
the idea is, is we "scramble" the signals, then we  convert it in =
the 
ultrasound, we filter it, and in the final results we can  hear some
v=
oices that, for example, are call us with our names,  or there are 
intelli=
gible voices, we can be more sure, that there are  not
radio fragments, but=
 maybe an intelligent entity that  is trying to 
communicate with us.
 
 
w=
ith all these modules i had very interesting  results, but the 
ghost-stati=
on 2 project is not finished yet. i hope to be  finished until the end 
of =
this year.

 
hope i my writing has been understandable  :)

One thing i would lik=

One thing i would like  everyone who reads this realize 
is t

Now i do wan=
t to say that the research into the boxes and other  devices by 
Frank and =
others can not go unnoticed, but there is still one or  two flaws 
in them.=


I mean, with the short bit i listened to, i dont  feel as if they are 
ba=
shing you or frank personally but the idea behind the  boxes, but without a=
 
doubt in a ignorant fashion.

Regardless, i  personally try to stay away =
from the boxes, but i join this 
site inorder to  learn more about them and=
 how they work. To me the boxes 
have to much "chance"  to may be or may no=
t be something. I have used one in 
the past and had an  interesting result=
, but for all i know, it could have 
been a rogue radio wave  from a statio=
n in the area. Im just hoping to give 
you an idea of this  thinking is VS =
bashing your ideas and work, which im 
simpley not. Science is  about provi=
ng something from every angle and being 
without a doubt its correct  witho=
ut anyone able to say its something else.

Unfortunetly, with the  boxes, t=
here is alot of noise and when matrixing 
comes into mind, you create a  si=
tuation where something is absolutly nothing, 
seems to be otherwise. Im no=
t  saying they dont work, from it, again im 
saying it could be a  "chance"=
.

Video, pictures are fool proof, audio really isnt, and  honestly, when m=
y 
team picks up EVPs we go into them with a doubtful mind and  dont depend=
 on 
them to be our evidence.

  <DIV><BR><BR>Well Id first wish to introduce myself. My name is=
 Matt Dowdell 
  and im from a small group of people who have been doing pa=
ranormal 
  research/investigat<WBR>ion in the CT area. This is my first po=
st, but i have 
  been lurking threw these forums for some time.<BR><BR>One=
 thing i would like 
  everyone who reads this realize is that paranormal 
=
  research/investigat<WBR>ing, like any new science, nothing can be written=
 in 
  stone.<BR><BR>Now i do want to say that the research into the boxes =
and other 
  devices by Frank and others can not go unnoticed, but there is=
 still one or 
  two flaws in them.<BR><BR>I mean, with the short bit i lis=
tened to, i dont 
  feel as if they are bashing you or frank personally but=
 the idea behind the 
  boxes, but without a doubt in a ignorant fashion.<B=
R><BR>Regardless, i 
  personally try to stay away from the boxes, but i jo=
in this site inorder to 
  learn more about them and how they work. To me t=
he boxes have to much "chance" 
  to may be or may not be something. I have=
 used one in the past and had an 
  interesting result, but for all i know,=
 it could have been a rogue radio wave 
  from a station in the area. Im ju=
st hoping to give you an idea of this 
  thinking is VS bashing your ideas =
and work, which im simpley not. Science is 
  about proving something from =
every angle and being without a doubt its correct 
  without anyone able to=
 say its something else.<BR><BR>Unfortunetly, with the 
  boxes, there is a=
lot of noise and when matrixing comes into mind, you create a 
  situation =
where something is absolutly nothing, seems to be otherwise. Im not 
  sayi=
ng they dont work, from it, again im saying it could be a 
  "chance".<BR><=
BR>Video, pictures are fool proof, audio really isnt, and 
  honestly, when=
 my team picks up EVPs we go into them with a doubtful mind and 
  dont dep=
end on them to be our evidence.<BR><BR></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
