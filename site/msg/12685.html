Thanks David for coming out with info on Dr Rorke.=A0 I will tell you brief=
ly that some of the info he provided in the C2C show and on his web site wa=
s a real eye opener for me.=A0 I have now completed about one year of check=
ing out EVP and I have learned an awful lot about myself and the other side=
.=A0 One year ago when I began my investigation I would not have dared make=
 such a claim to the public nor to myself.=A0 
=A0
I do understand a bit ab=
out the scientific process.=A0 But, I would welcome anyone from the scienti=
fic=A0world to do one simple thing:=A0 join this or another EVP group, buy =
a radio shack hack, modify it for less than $50, and go talk to yourself so=
mewhere with the hack turned on.=A0 Now, that does not sound like a scienti=
fic approach, but what I am finding in my research is that supposedly serio=
us scientific researchers will not do this simple test.=A0 When I ask them =
to come check out=A0our group and participate with their own=A0box=A0they i=
nstead choose to sit on the sidelines and wait for others to offer proof to=
 them.=A0=A0=A0Maybe there is no research money in it for them...who would =
give big bucks for EVP research?=A0 However, it seems to me that any seriou=
s investigator in this arena would jump at a chance test it out for $50 and=
 two months of their time...part time.
=A0
My challenge would be for any "s=
cientific researcher", therefore, is to come join a group, buy a box, try t=
o communicate,=A0share results with the group,=A0share what others are expe=
riencing,=A0and truly participate with the group.=A0 In a month or two, the=
 researcher can then quit the=A0group, if he or she wishes, and begin "real=

=A0know that he/she can join a group without anyone knowing who they really=
 are.=A0 Get a new email address and go for it.=A0

If someone goes thr=

Having said all that, I rem=

Yes I have experience with Dr. Rorke. He is com=

inary claims without scientific evidence to back it up makes every EVP rese=
archer look like a cool aid drinker. Mr. Moon originally indicated that onl=
y a magic thirty people could make the device work, which would suggest sel=

t have scientific principles backing it up.
