<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Dave,

Well, for example, I walked into our &quot;computer room&quot; (spare
bedroom/office/library) not long after the evps were recorded and my
radio turned itself on. My wife Patt witnessed it, so it&#x27;s not my
imagination that it did turn on. As I stepped into the room, the
&quot;morning show&quot; cut to a voice saying &quot;MMM! Cinnamon rolls and coffee!
Bring enough for us?&quot;

I happened to be holding a mug of hot coffee and a plate of cinnamon
rolls that Patt had baked for breakfast. I scalded myself as I sloshed
coffee around after hearing the voice!

I am not the type who tells stories or seeks attention.

I thought for a few moments that I was listening to a radio talk show
and that it was a coincidence that the mention of cinnamon rolls
happened as I stepped into the room. But I eventually blurted out a
&quot;hello,&quot; and was answered. After a few moments and to my questions,
the voice said his name was Steve Tate -- and following a
back-and-forth conversation that I recorded he said he was a Virginia
state trooper who died in 1989 in a car crash a mile from his home.
Over the next day or two, he said his body was buried in Redmond, Va.,
and we spoke for several days in little snatches of conversation.
Along the way, a fellow named &quot;Luke&quot; entered the conversation. Other
unnamed voices began to say &quot;Hi Al!&quot; It was a bit too much.

I was brought up in a very strict Protestant family. I became leery of
what was unfolding. I bashed the radio and threw it in the trash. Then
I began hearing the voices mixed in with my CPAP machine (I have sleep
apnea) at night, which makes a high-pitched whooshing noise.

Next, I began hearing the &quot;Hi Al!&quot; voice as a faint whisper now and
then as I&#x27;d walk through the house.

I got scared. I had gotten rid of the radio(s) but was still hearing
the voices. I felt I was going crazy. I told my pastor about it and
asked for help. He refused -- said he was afraid he might get an
&quot;attachment&quot; and bring it home to his family. I contacted something
like 20 protestant pastors by phone and not a single one of them would
come to my home to help.

Eventually a Catholic priest agreed to help on the condition that I
supply a recording of the voices as &quot;proof&quot; of the problem. Using my
digital recorder, I recorded so many &quot;conversations&quot; that I filled up
a CD. Awhile later, after turning it over to the priest, the Catholic
bishop granted the priest permission to come to our home to conduct a
mass and an &quot;exorcism of place.&quot; The priest explained that old homes
and other places could become &quot;infested&quot; with evil spirits. After he
performed the ceremony, the voices seemed to quit for awhile but
returned after a few days.

Now, I was not sure whether the voices were &quot;evil&quot; or just
&quot;conversational.&quot; My brother died of kidney failure during this time
and I later heard his voice calling my name. It ~was~ his voice.

A lot more has happened.... At this point, I am no longer &quot;surprised&quot;
by hearing the voices electronically or otherwise. I just want to know
more about what&#x27;s happening -- how it can possibly be &quot;real&quot; and what
I should understand in terms of the big picture....

&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Al, and I&#x27;m new to this list. I&#x27;m 57, early-retired due to
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; disability, and have far more free time than I want or know what to do
&gt;&gt; with.
&gt;&gt; Which is what got me in trouble recently. After watching &quot;White Noise&quot;
&gt;&gt; awhile back, one day I turned on a recorder and turned a radio tuner while
&gt;&gt; asking if &quot;anyone&quot; would like to talk. To my great surprise, I found
&gt;&gt; voices
&gt;&gt; immediately after uploading and playing the file. I know about evps from
&gt;&gt; watching the Ghost Hunters, but these voices were talking to me in a
&gt;&gt; conversational tone and about stuff relational to questions I asked and to
&gt;&gt; stuff I was doing at the time! This progressed over time into a running
&gt;&gt; &quot;conversation&quot; with apparently living beings who are invisible but somehow
&gt;&gt; sharing this house! Can someone here please relieve my anxiety a bit? I&#x27;m
&gt;&gt; wondering if I&#x27;m messing with something that I shouldn&#x27;t be messing with.
&gt;&gt; What are the consequences of this -- and can anyone enlighten me about the
&gt;&gt; rules or protocol for dealing with these invisible people? And, has anyone
&gt;&gt; found there is NO WAY to talk about this without sounding crazy??
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Al
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
