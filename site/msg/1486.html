<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>If you need help making printed circuit boards, I can help. I have been 
making them for years using the Datak chemicals and get pretty good 
looking boards. All I need are the patterns.  I cannot make 
plated-through holes on double-sided boards, however, and have to use &quot;C&quot; 
wires when I need through-board connections.

&gt; Thanks. It&#x27;s not so much evolution, it&#x27;s using what I have, like the scrap
&gt; piece of aluminum for the panel. The next &quot;evolution&quot; will be the printed
&gt; circuit board. Of course I keep adding functions, which means more board
&gt; real estate, which raises costs. I really want the linear sweep, and tone
&gt; injection to be standard functions. It would be interesting to use all
&gt; stereo speakers, and mics in the echo boxes, but that almost doubles the
&gt; components again. I&#x27;ve thought about a stripped down version, like just the
&gt; tuner and sweep generator, then use something like a boom box for the all
&gt; the audio and recording functions. If it was only linear sweep, the system
&gt; could be made on a small board===cheap.
