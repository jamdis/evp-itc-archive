Ok, if i am hearing David correctly, he said "it is a paper clip or paper  =

tie" and he told me to let you know that He will not play this game with y=
ou 
 anymore.  I had another spirit lady say, "paper tie," or it sounded li=
ke  
something to hold paper's together, like staples, and one said "Bible"=
 at 
the  end, but I didn't get him on record because, I ran out just when =
he 
spoke.   One spirit even said, a tiny something or other.   So, you tak=
e your  
pick, Robert is it?   sf

Please do not try to open the file before  noon Wed=

Answers anyone=
