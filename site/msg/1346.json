I was interviewed by\n&gt;Scott and Doug for about an hour yesterday on Ghostly Talk (\n&gt;http://www.ghostlytalk.com ). The topic? New research I&#39;ve done on\n&gt;the infamous &quot;Spiricom Mark IV&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;If you&#39;re familiar with the story - basically I believe I&#39;ve helped\n&gt;dispel the goofy thought that Dr. George JEFFRIES Mueller did NOT\n&gt;work for NASA (people have confused him with Dr. George EDWIN\n&gt;Mueller who DID work for NASA and is considered the &quot;father of\n&gt;Skylab&quot;, etc.). Plus I was able to disseminate 2 previously unknown\n&gt;audio recordings (by Dr. David Rivers and the late author Harold\n&gt;Sherman) which showed inconsistencies in the Spiricom recordings and\n&gt;how O&#39;Neil &quot;could&quot; have used an artificial larynx to fake the\n&gt;conversations. On the other hand - I tracked down a lot of\n&gt;documentation which definitely shows that Dr. George J. Mueller was\n&gt;a real person and nearly everything written about him (in the\n&gt;Spiricom manual, &quot;The Ghost of 29 Megacycles&quot;) is verifiable so...\n&gt;\n&gt;The big questions are:\n&gt;\n&gt;1. If this was a hoax - how DID Bill O&#39;Neil get so much detailed\n&gt;information on Mueller (he actually claimed that Mueller told him\n&gt;all this via clairaudience)? Was he really an extremely good psychic?\n&gt;\n&gt;2. If the Spiricom Mark IV really DID work, why were other users\n&gt;(such as Sarah Estep from the AAEVP) unable to get it operate?\n&gt;\n&gt;I still have more things to look into so maybe some more answers\n&gt;will be forthcoming (or muddy the waters even more). And I want to\n&gt;thank member Jaime (i.e. xtal32768@...) for finding the\n&gt;Cornell Alumni News with photo of Mueller at Picatinny Arsenal.\n&gt;\n&gt;Guy\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet a preview of Live Earth, the hottest event this summer - only on MSN \nhttp://liveearth.msn.com?source=msntaglineliveearthhm"}
