&gt; I have replied to a few posts here in the past and I intend to do so with
&gt; much more regularity now. I have come to the realization that skeptics
&gt; cannot be avoided and my audio needs to get out there for feedback.
&gt;
&gt; For those who don&#x27;t know me, my name is Tim Woolworth. I have been (sigh) a
&gt; ghost hunter for years. I discovered ITC a couple of years ago and I was
&gt; relegated to using a Shack Hack until 6 or 7 months ago. At that time, a
&gt; Minibox Plus found its way to me and my view of ITC and the afterlife has
&gt; changed entirely. Since I have been practicing ITC, ghost hunting just isn&#x27;t
&gt; that much fun anymore.
&gt;
&gt; I now do sessions about three times a week. I have been keeping my audio
&gt; clips to myself until now. I have posted clips on other boards and I almost
&gt; never get replies. One thing I have noticed about this group is that
&gt; everyone is good at listening to clips and responding so I decided to start
&gt; posting only at this forum instead of the others.
&gt;
&gt; I have started a folder today. The clips put in there are from last night.
&gt; I recorded a ten minute session after writing the reply to the skeptic last
&gt; night. These are five short clips, and a transcript, from that session which
&gt; had activity the entire time. The clips include konstantin Raudive, the
&gt; Others talking about using the Ghost Boxes, a warning for me, and my new
&gt; favorite clip: a rapper comes through at the end to say good-bye.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for listening.
