Yeah. But it is also possible that I just didn't hear it because I was dist=
racted. Unfortunately it doesn't happen that often, so I can't say for sure=
.

  Fascinating! I've had this idea that the EVP are often no=
t recorded by the microphone but somehow make their way in at the actual po=
int where the storage is made, whether it be analog (tape) or digital.

So much we don't know ...

  I am curious if anyone with a microphone wired to a remote site has ever =
gotten any EVP in real time.

      I took part in an investigation of Ashm=
ore Estates, near Ashmore IL, on Saturday night. We had six video cameras s=
et up in the three halls of the building. The video for all was being monit=
ored and recorded at a central location. Alas, we did not have microphones =
at the camera sites conected to the central location. I wonder what we migh=
t have heard if we did?
