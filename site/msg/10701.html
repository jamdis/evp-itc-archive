<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I guess there is form of mechanical filtering going on. I think the 
term echo box is probably incorrect to discribe it&#x27;s function. These 
system do not need the sound chamber to work, like the Mini box, or 
hack radios, it seems the entites work mostly inside the 
electronics. I even added direct mode to my boxes, an output that 
comes out of the tuner, and just through a pre-amp to bring it up to 
about one volt level for recording. You can record directly from the 
headphone jack of any of these systems, where there is no air 
vibration, and you still get voices. The &quot;echo box&quot; seems to enhance 
the voices, but I have no idea how. Size does not seem to be a major 
factor. I have used boxes from almost as small as a pack of 
cigarettes, up to four feet long. The material seesms to matter, 
with galvanized sheet metal scrap, I get mostly spirit voices, with 
aluminum foil I get my ET guys, and with copper, it seems to be 
higher spirits, but I&#x27;ve only used it once so far. I have made boxes 
in the form of an orgone accumulator, that is layered cotten, and 
steel screen. it seems like everything works, and there is one level 
or another that will use wiaht you&#x27;re using at any particular 
moment. That&#x27;s why I say there are no absolutes, no rules. They use 
what we use. It&#x27;ll make ya nutz if you try to nail it down. I don&#x27;t 
have the intellect, nor the education to figure this stuff out, so I 
run entirely on intuition.  Cut and try is my favoite method.

 Peraonlly I prefer an echo box with 1 inch sqaure channels, two or 
three channels running lengtwise in 4 X 6 (very approximate) inch 
box. 

 All the current boxes run in both modes, direct or with the echo 
box/sound chamber.

&gt; Ok, another question if anyone will be so kind to answer.  This is 
for resonance inside the box(hence the name echo chamber) correct?  
&gt; 
&gt; So things I possibly need to take into consideration when building 
mine are:
&gt; a.  Types of material provide better results, copper and aluminum 
versus materials that absorb/dampen such as egg crate foam or cloth 
lining.
&gt; b.  Size of box (length, width, height) to produce the suspected 
resonance frequency.
&gt; c.  Amount of chambers (I noticed 3 is the magical number )  
Having chambers increases the resonance effect more than just having 
an empty box without chambers.  
&gt; d.  Outside influence such as air which is why Frank mentioned it 
needing to be air-tight
&gt; e.  The types of outside influence is from the spirits getting to 
the inside.  So is it or is it not a good idea to wrap the box in 
absorbing/dampening materials since they are manipulating the sound 
inside a box?  I wouldn&#x27;t think that it would matter what&#x27;s on the 
outside as long as noise from the outside isn&#x27;t bombarding the 
outsides of the box causing internal problems and distorting 
anything.
&gt; 
&gt; Pardon my thought process, but I&#x27;m just trying to learn the 
concepts here.  So if I am way of base, will someone please let me 
know.  :)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; 
&gt; This is for the echo chambers right?  Can someone give me a link 
to more details about how it works?
&gt; 
&gt; Is it that you put the mic on one end, the speaker on the other, 
and the sounds mix throughout the chamber to form words from the 
speaker to the mic?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any and all help

&gt;  I didn&#x27;t have enough copper clad board, so used some copper 
sheet, and you can see where I spliced one of the channel dividers. 
Just have to be air tight.
