I don&#39;t \nsweep in the car, but I do have a CD that I burned with Portuguese crowd babble on it, \nwhich I have played in the car and gotten interesting results.  Though there is something \nabout that recorder and my car (a Prius) which is odd, all on it&#39;s own... even without \nbackground.  ;-)\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; I like to use a portable recorder so don&#39;t have to be chained to the \n&gt; computer to record a session also I live in an area where I don&#39;t \n&gt; always get good reception so I like to try different areas of my house \n&gt; and its easier to move a recorder around then my computer!! \n&gt; \n&gt; Kay\n&gt;"}
