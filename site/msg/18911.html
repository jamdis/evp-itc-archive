&gt; Was that the same person who stole box #63 after i tested it and sent it
&gt; back to you. I hate to see these things go to waste. It really gets to me
&gt; when you send these boxes to people after spending several hours making
&gt; them, only to sit on someones shelf getting dusty.
&gt;
&gt; There are a lot of people who want these, so how can you tell who is a good
&gt; candidate to get one?

&gt; &gt; One of the skepdorks wanted to put one of my boxes ina faraday cage for
&gt; &gt; testing. My response was Well Dah, of course it won&#x27;t work if you block
&gt; out
&gt; &gt; the radio signals. I told him to bite me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As far as EVP, I thought someone tried that and you can get &quot;normal&quot; EVP.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I just had a thought go thru my head ( Oh shit ).What would happen if
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; put a voice recorder in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; Faraday Cage, and have a session with a ghost box.... The Faraday Cage
&gt; &gt; &gt; isn&#x27;t supposed to pick up radio
&gt; &gt; &gt; interference right ? Would it pick up the other voices or not ? I know
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; entities are talking thru the radio
&gt; &gt; &gt; but has anyone ever tried it ? Stupid question huh ?????
