For the past couple years I&#39;ve been using\n&gt; mostly what I call direct mode, or no echo chamber. When I use an aluminum\n&gt; foil chamber I seem to get more ET types, and that&#39;s what I used to get &quot;we\n&gt; come from the 6th planet&quot; years ago.\n&gt; \n&gt;  A very large echo chamber can have a dramatic effect, like 12 inches\n&gt; square, and 4 feet long. I made one that size out of MDF board and lined it\n&gt; wiht aluminum foil, the voices were so demonic sounding that I took it\n&gt; apart. Later I found that if something works, you tend to get the negative\n&gt; guys to try to scare you away from it.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, May 15, 2010 at 8:33 PM, &lt;dc3644@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So in building a Frank&#39;s Box is it essential to use an echo chamber?
