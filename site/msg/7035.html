<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ron,

Hopefully your sister has received the radio already.  It got shipped 
priority mail.  Have fun with it.  I really like the way the FM scan 
rate is....

&gt; I will be traveling to San Diego from Mexico to visit my sister and 
pick up the RS 125 Mike is sending me.  I will be in the San Diego 
and El Centro area from Feb 15 to 19 and I would love to be able to 
meet-up with someone from the area who has experience with EVP 
technology.  Mike is sending a box already hacked so we can work with 
the box and hopefully get something recorded.  Since I have little 
experience as a newbie to this, I would love to see how someone puts 
all of it together...recording, analyzing, etc.  
&gt;    
&gt;   If you have the time and are willing to give a little on-the-job 
training, please let me know by email.  By the way, in mid June I 
will be traveling from Penn. to NC for two weeks and would love to 
get together with folks over in that area.  I will probably be 
ordering a mini-box to be sent to my folks house in Allentown, so I 
will have that to play with.  Let me know.  Ron Lederer
