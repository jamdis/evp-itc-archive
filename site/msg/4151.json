I would like imput if you would please.  I figure there is \ntrial and error in this research so all comments are welcome.  I did \nnot alter these files, so they are raw audio.\n\n               In addition, the one audio file that say my name along \nwith conference call looks like they knew I was receiving a conference \ncall from Mike and Bruce, which I missed, who would have knew!  LOL!\n\n               There is also a message regarding Roberson Place.  I do \nnot know what this means, but say &quot;Get A Box&quot;."}
