<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, dearest (I typed &quot;deadrest&quot; first), I was about to ask you  
what you are up to with the TV sweep because I was away for a month  
and have obviously got a lot to catch up on.  So, please tell me what  
you&#x27;re doing with this. Please show me the pictures you mention, too,  
because otherwise I can&#x27;t tell you if they&#x27;re a sitcom, not the Other  
Side.

;)

&gt; I am to watch her on Montel&#x27;s show.
&gt;
&gt;  I did a second test with the larger TV, and got images that were  
&gt; like full size, some larger than the screen, they look like  
&gt; portraits, but now I think the group in not the place present them.  
&gt; Most would prefer to discuss some trivial POS, or some whispery  
&gt; noise that just has to be a voice if it can just be filtered  
&gt; enough! Y&#x27;all wonder why I get fed up and quit the damn group! God  
&gt; Almighty!!
