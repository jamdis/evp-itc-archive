<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Titanium is one of the worst metal conductors, around 1.8 E06 S/m. Stainless
steel is in that same range.

I wouldn&#x27;t bother using anything but copper for most electronics
applications. I will silver plate RF circuits I build for VHF-microwave uses
but that&#x27;s far beyond what&#x27;s needed for anything like a ghost box. Plain old
solid or stranded copper wire and copper circuit board material would do
fine, I think. Plus it&#x27;s a lot cheaper. No reason to get expensive if you
don&#x27;t need to.

&gt;  Wow!  Silver, too bad it&#x27;s so expensive, how much silver do you need, is
&gt; this for building another Spirit Box?  What about titanium?

&gt;  Looks like platinum is around 9.4 E06 S/m.  Not as good as copper, silver
&gt; or gold but still a decent conductor.
&gt; Iridium is better, at 18.7 E06 S/m. Still not as good as silver, copper or
&gt; gold.
&gt; Platinum-Iridium alloys are worse, at 5.28 E06 S/m.

&gt;&gt;  Silver is the best conductor known, with a conductivity of 63.01 E06
&gt;&gt; Siemens per meter. Copper is next best at 59.6 E06 S/m. Gold is not the
&gt;&gt; best, at 45.2 E06 S/m. Aluminum is much farther down, at 37.8 E06 S/m.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Silver and gold are expensive. They are usually used to plate RF
&gt;&gt; assemblies where the skin effect takes place (current doesn&#x27;t flow uniformly
&gt;&gt; through a conductor at RF frequencies but mainly travels at the surface of
&gt;&gt; the conductor). Gold has the advantage that it never tarnishes or corrodes
&gt;&gt; with most things it is exposed to. It&#x27;s used a lot in contacts for rotary
&gt;&gt; switches and relays.

&gt;&gt;&gt;    Firrst Electrical job I was on as a helper in 1976 was to pick up a
&gt;&gt;&gt; pole that was to feeding a house someone had wired in aluminum that had
&gt;&gt;&gt; burned to the ground due to a bad connection it had just been built. I had
&gt;&gt;&gt; been with my old man on a many job sinhce I was 8 and never had seen
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything like that. Copper is the only way to gold only better conductor is
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gold. but who can handle that in a house. worste case of emf I have ever
&gt;&gt;&gt; seen was a fancy chandaler that someone had over sized bulbs in and that
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing flared up the whole house to very dangerous levels. when they say 60
&gt;&gt;&gt; watt max they mean it for your own safety. this thing had around 10 100 watt
&gt;&gt;&gt; bulbs in it and the emfs were causing all kinds of nice images after 30
&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes in the house we were having them too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  Aluminum wire is a nightmare! The stuff tends to overheat, oxidizes
&gt;&gt;&gt; where interconnections are made and will spark, etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I bought a transformer at Gateway Electronics in St. Louis some years ago
&gt;&gt;&gt; that looked like a great transformer for a high-current 12 volt supply. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; secondary appeared to be wound with #8 enameled wire. I found out the
&gt;&gt;&gt; secondary was wound with aluminum wire. After I built the power supply and
&gt;&gt;&gt; tried to get 20 amps from it but couldn&#x27;t, I gave up on it and got another
&gt;&gt;&gt; transformer wound with copper wire.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   We have a touch lamp that comes on by itself, and we have electric

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is on. When the furnace comes on, it affects the boxes, and--when I first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; started doign EVP recordings with white noise, if the furnace happened to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come on when I was recording a voice would report &quot;it&#x27;s on fire!&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     Yes.  Also faulty wiring, which is even more dangerous.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also with flakey transformers or other power distribution in the area,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or power lines.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps you can check with some neighbors, and see how their power is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   Hi All,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there someone here that can answer and electrical question for me?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; During the case that I recorded those possible EVP&#x27;s-there was a loud
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tapping noise that seemed to come from the 2nd bedroom. Upon checking my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; logs, every time one of  these clicks were heard, there would be an EMF
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spike in the livingroom. The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the livingroom
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; downstairs. The home owners have also reported that they have a touch lamp
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that comes on all the time by itself and the lights in the Kitchen will dim
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; occasionally.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now these taps are not consistent in timing, loudness or rhythm. Could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this be the work of faulty breakers?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; April
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
