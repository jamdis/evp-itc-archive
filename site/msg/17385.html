<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

Though my own experience with the box (in Canada) included a personal message that defied &quot;normal&quot; explanations, I regard that as anecdotal proof.  I don&#x27;t share the details on this list because they won&#x27;t prove anything to anyone... not that I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d make any difference, one way or the other, to anyone whose mind is made up.

I also believe that my experience was rooted in the balanced levels of expectation on both sides of the box. That intrigues and amuses me. I wasn&#x27;t desperate for a message from &quot;the other side,&quot; though the voice clearly had an urgent question for me, and repeated it twice.  

But, that may be one reason why I had such an impressive experience: I was interested but not desperate.  

That&#x27;s also how I explain the bitterness of some debunkers; they&#x27;ve been badly disappointed and, in their heart of hearts, they&#x27;re actually desperate for comfort or closure from &quot;the other side.&quot; 

That kind of grasping, in energy terms, can exceed anything I&#x27;d describe as reasonable expectations.  As a parent, it reminds me most of a tantrum-y toddler or petulant teen, neither of whom I ever encouraged by giving in to their demands.

The cynical skeptics and debunkers go beyond saying, &quot;Well, I didn&#x27;t want it, anyway.&quot;  They are so distraught, they take it to a much higher level, asserting &quot;...and it isn&#x27;t real, either.&quot;

I feel profoundly sorry for them, but they usually don&#x27;t want sympathy; they want to vent, often in inappropriate manners and/or settings.

That can&#x27;t become my issue.  I&#x27;m here to learn and to share whatever I can.

However, your idea of &quot;plants&quot; eludes me.  I&#x27;m sorry to be so blunt, but that sounds like a short route to paranoia. By not sharing our info and ideas, I think we&#x27;d be short-changing ourselves, each other and -- for the more altruistically-minded -- this field.

(I don&#x27;t pretend to be working in this field for altruistic reasons.  I&#x27;m also not in this to become rich and/or famous.  I&#x27;d be a lot happier as a recluse, working on my paintings, living in the cute beachfront cottage with the white picket fence, and avoiding controversy.  Instead, I&#x27;m fascinated with this kind of research, for better or for worse.)

For me, the simplest way to &quot;stake a claim&quot; with my ideas and info is to be very forthright with them.  I share them broadly and steadily, so there&#x27;s no doubt about my originality or my integrity. (Unfortunately, sharing broadly sort of defeats my aspirations of being a recluse.)

I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;d serve me to conceal what I&#x27;m doing.  Seeing what other people do with my info and ideas... that&#x27;s a reward, not a liability. 

Sure, I&#x27;m irked when others copy my articles, word-for-word, or barely change my research notes and claim them as their own.  At any moment, with a few clicks at Copyscape or even at Google, I can find at least 50 websites that have blatantly plagiarized my writing.

I can either spend my time chasing after the plagiarists, or I can pursue my research and share each new discovery with others.  I choose the latter.  Sooner or later, the people who matter will realize where the plagiarized materials have been coming from: Me.

And, in the immortal words of Tammy Faye Bakker Messner -- whose voice I&#x27;d love to hear from a box -- &quot;you can&#x27;t go forward in life looking in the rear view mirror.&quot;

I&#x27;m looking forward, eager to see what&#x27;s next in this field.  It&#x27;s always an adventure!

Cheerfully,
Fiona

&gt; I guess the format of this site is the best we can have for sharing this stuff. EVP&#x27;s are one thing, but info from the real-time gathering seems more plentiful in intelligence we are receiving. I personally was able to get feedback from a deceased loved one on whether they wre ok on the other side and so on by whomever the messenger was. I do get quite disgusted with the ones scrambling to score a carreer in this stuff and the ones who go as far to infiltrate groups with their own team &#x27;plants&#x27; to steal info and scoop ideas and so on. You&#x27;d be surprised at who they are.
