Yeah I heard quite a few people were there. Maybe you could post some of your results here for people Rosemary. It would be nice if the box owners posted results for those with interest in them as well as for Frank. Ive been waiting on a few of you to post but so far Bruce is the only one.

          I was at The Stanley Hotel in Colorado last weekend, and was excited to
get to work with the new Mini-Box built by Ron Ricketts. I was also
happy to meet Frank for the first time! I had several sessions with
the Mini-Box with April and Allen Slaughter of the Association for the
Study of Unexplained Phenomena, and found it quite impressive. Very
compact, long battery life (and rechargeable) and good clarity. "Seven"
came through for me in every session. We had a session with Mark Macy,
and a short one with Frank -- wish it could have been longer. I'm
getting one of the first of these boxes, and it will be a valuable
addition to the two Frank's Boxes that I'm working with.

I haven't reviewed the recordings yet, as I just got home. But we got
many clear responses to questions.
