<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I got a very good session through the 12-470 radio today on AM.  I had 
asked our technicians Mike and Lisa if they can bring John Lennon 
foward to speak with me and they did.  John Lennon has been my idol 
all my life and today is the 27 year anniversary of his death.  Mike 
and Lisa work very well with me in contacting the ones i try to get 
to.  In the next post you will hear the file i got, which may be the 
best file i ever got with any radio or box.  I asked if John was aware 
of how he died and he responded &quot;Yes, Bullet&quot;.  As everyone probably 
knows that John Lennon was shot outside his home in NYC in 1980.  I 
can&#x27;t believe that our friends on the other side are so comfortable 
with me, that they keep exceeding my expectations of what i will hear 
through any of these devices.  I also have other files from this 
session, but this was the most important one and proves that i am 
speaking with spirits on another plane.
