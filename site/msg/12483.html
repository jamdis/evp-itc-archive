HAHAHAHAHA!! A GUN!!  What does he think, you can kill'em twice :)))

Unless of course it is a water pistol filled with holy water :)

The advantage of once following Wicca is that you learn belief in a thing gives it power.
That is why I don't believe in the evil parts of this.  The more you believe in them, the
more you are going to see them and the more they will mess with you.

In my opinion anyway.  Although in support of that theory, I've yet to be hurt or 
possessed (that I know of)

This week we received an email from a guy in another group and he was telling me that when he goes out on an investigation he takes along a relic or two and holy water! I asked him if he carries all of that...how does he have the hand movement to carry a digital camera, Paranormal Puck, temperature detector, EVP recorder? He has yet to answer...LOL. ..
Another guy who is a local investigator once posted that he carries a GUN with him when he goes out on investigation! ! THIS guy scares me way more than the relic toting, holy water thrower...
