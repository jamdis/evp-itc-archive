What exactly are you doing when you use a ritual \nor prayer for protection? You are placing limitations on the session. \nWhat is the point of doing research in ITC if you are not willing to \ndeal with all aspects of it? The enemy is not some nasty entity out \nthere that wants to cuss and threaten you, it is your fear. All of us \nwho have been doing this for any length of time come across, as \nSumption calls them &quot;paper tigers&quot;. They bark, bark, bark but have no \nreal bite! Unchecked fear causes the most damage both psychologically \nand physically. This fear (the lack of control of it) is also the \nreason why people make up these rituals.Regards,Frank R.\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----From: Robin Searcy Henson \n&lt;MudPuddleFarm@...&gt;To: EVP-ITC@...: Tuesday, January 15, 2008 5:29:04 \nPMSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: PROTECTION RITUAL FILE POSTED\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Oookay, that is scary.

I&#39;m someone who prays and meditates often, but I&gt; \nwonder if bad spirits are capable of disregarding the boundaries we \nset&gt; for them. I do know that when I told my threatening EVPer to go \nback&gt; outside it worked; in fact, I haven&#39;t been able to record ANY \nEVP in my&gt; house since then.

I have evp&#39;s of \nthis entity saying horrible things. I think&gt; I may start using \nprotection now...&gt;&gt; Carol B.&gt;&gt; &gt; As someone who has never used a \nprotection ritual (even though I&gt; consider&gt; &gt; myself a very spiritual \nperson), I&#39;m not sure I understand what the&gt; ritual&gt; &gt; is intended to \nprotect the person invoking it from. I&#39;m not being a&gt; smart&gt; &gt; ass; \nI&#39;m simply trying to learn. Can we be hurt physically or&gt; \npsychically&gt; &gt; by certain spirits, or can our experimentation open a \ndark portal&gt; that&#39;s&gt; &gt; not meant to be opened? My instinct has always \nbeen that if I don&#39;t&gt; &gt; acknowledge evil it can have no power over \nme, but perhaps that&#39;s&gt; &gt; ignorant. I once invited spirits into my \nhouse from outside and&gt; &gt; immediately recorded a negative EVP while \nheating a cup of coffee in&gt; the&gt; &gt; microwave. I was too ecstatic to \nbe frightened by the message, but&gt; since&gt; &gt; then I&#39;ve wondered what \nkind of spirit would want to say such a thing&gt; to&gt; &gt; me and if I \nshould be more cautious in the future. I would love some&gt; &gt; feedback \non this recording.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Robin&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----\n-&gt; &gt; From: Frank&gt; Sumption&lt;mailto:franks-boxes@ \nhotmail.com&lt;mailto:franks- boxes%40hotmail. com&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; To:&gt; EVP-\nITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;mailto:EVP- ITC%40yahoogroup s.com&gt;&lt;mailto:EVP-\nITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;mailto:EVP- ITC%40yahoogroup s.com&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: \nSunday, January 13, 2008 8:09 PM&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: PROTECTION \nRITUAL FILE POSTED&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Bad idea!
