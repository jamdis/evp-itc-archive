Are Mike and Lisa people you knew in life?

&gt; Lisby,

&gt; It&#x27;s funny that you were the only person to reply to the files I  
&gt; posted.
&gt;
&gt; The more research I do the more of a relationship I build with the  
&gt; spirits that speak with me
&gt; on a daily basis. it is always the same two, Mike and Lisa .  
&gt; sometimes there is a third but he never
&gt; gives his name. Frank&#x27;s box #12 is a very good box it has am random  
&gt; and linear also FM linear sweeps
&gt; so you have a variety of options. I don&#x27;t have the best radio  
&gt; signal in my area but I&#x27;m trying
&gt; different things and it seems to be getting better. The box  
&gt; generates a little more noise than usual
&gt; but it is an older box and that is to be expected. I get about a  
&gt; 25% rate of hearing responses and messages in real time
&gt;
&gt; as I receive them I will surely post them as I have been doing all  
&gt; along only no one seems to care unless Frank
&gt; says or posts something. It&#x27;s nice to know someone listened.
&gt;
&gt; thanks

&gt; The extreme wonderfulness of these new EVP clips from the box lies in
&gt; their sheer normalcy. When Mike answered your greeting with
&gt; &quot;Whatzup?&quot; I actually started crying. This is what I have been hoping
&gt; for all my life. Please, please, send more as they come in. I&#x27;m
&gt; living vicariously through you.
