Made in 2006. The FM, and tape deck were\n&gt; not working, but they are now. I added a voltage regulator\n&gt; for a manual tune control that I am using here. I&#39;ll add\n&gt; the sweep board later on. The adavnatoage to these is\n&gt; pre-existing sound amplifiers, that saves $$ and time.  \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; See what people are saying about Windows Live.
