<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce,

I got up this morning with almost 50 emails in my inbox! I did read  
all the emails and listen to the clips. I&#x27;m new at this box stuff (and  
don&#x27;t have one of my own), so what I do is listen to the clips first  
to see if I can pick out any words and then look at the clip name to  
see if I&#x27;m correct. The new files posted by you and Juli were great  
and I think I&#x27;m starting to train my ears, because I was hearing what  
the file names indicated.

I&#x27;ve mentioned a couple of times how excited I am to have joined this  
forum, a lot of really intelligent, interesting and dedicated members!  
I&#x27;ve belonged to other forums relating to different subjects  
(software, african greys, etc.) and this forum is definitely more  
active than most and I&#x27;m starting to get familiar with the regulars.

Yes, you&#x27;ll get a bunch of reactions to your post (below)! The  
Internet is a wonderful thing, to be able to connect people with the  
same interests despite their physical distances. Hmmmm, sounds a bit  
like Frank&#x27;s Boxes to me . . . quantum entanglement anyone???

Now I&#x27;d better get some work done.

&gt; But ,
&gt;
&gt; yesterday I posted like 20 files and did not recieve one reply on any
&gt; of them.
&gt;
&gt; Yet a post about a broken cell phone recieves a hundred replies.
&gt; What is this group about?
&gt;
&gt; Frank is right what the hell is the sense of posting files to an EVP- 
&gt; ITC
&gt; group if no one pays attention to the evp&#x27;s or files that are posted.
&gt;
&gt; I admit I do not reply to every single post myself but I do try and
&gt; reply to most.
&gt;
&gt; If no one is even bothering to listen to the files you are really
&gt; missing what this is all about.
&gt;
&gt; Come o9n guy&#x27;s this is supposed to be about the exchange of ideas and
&gt; constructive suggestions on evp-itc research. It&#x27;s not a chat board or
&gt; a forum for personal vendeta&#x27;s
&gt;
&gt; Let&#x27;s get with the program and do some evp work.
&gt;
&gt; And I&#x27;ll bet I get some replies to this post that&#x27;s for sure !
