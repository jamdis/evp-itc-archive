<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I currently use this unit called the PX.  It was offered by a company called digital dowsing.  It was offered on a limited run by the creator Bill Chappell early 2010.

It is 1/2 ovilus 1/2 puck, which were 2 earlier devices created by Bill Chappell.  I have used this instrument on every investigation that I have been involved with and it has provided some interesting results to say the least.

The website with a full description on this device can be found here
www.digitaldowsing.com/px

Hope that this helps..

&gt; It sounds like what the Ovilus does.... Who has come up with this PX EMF?
&gt; I have an Ovilus, and I am not really sure about it yet.
&gt; Still testing it...... How much are they asking for this PX EMF ?
&gt; Some of this equipment gets really expensive......

&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] PX - Has anyone tried this piece of equipment?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hello Everyone:
&gt; 
&gt; I am wondering if anyone has tried the PX EMF meter for EVP? Below is a description of this meter, in case you haven&#x27;t heard of it. Any thoughts on this meter?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Country
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;The PX EMF meter is a talking ghost box which translate EMF signals into speech. It uses an internal database of 2000+ words or can translate in Phonetic Mode speech which is not in the dictionary. It also has a reverse Phonetic mode. My favorite though is the Touch Mode. In this mode, if the PX is left alone and someone or something touches it, it will start pinging like a deep sea submarine.
&gt; 
&gt; 1: Dictionary Mode the PX has 2048 internal words that are used in this mode
&gt; 2: Phonetic Mode the PX will use phonemes to speak
&gt; 3. Reverse Phonetic Mode The PX will reverse the phonetic output in effect it talks backwards
&gt; 4. Touch Mode this mode is used to detect if the device is being touched
&gt; 5. Voice Change Mode, this mode is the same as #1 dictionary mode except the voice
&gt; can be altered detected inputs
&gt; 6. Repeat Mode say last words said .. in this mode the PX will repeat the last words spoke from last said to first
&gt; up to 400 words.
&gt; 7. Energy Mode : this mode allows the user to set the sensitivity of the device with one of 3
&gt; preset levels. The PX will say LOW then give four beeps pressing mode during this time will set the Energy level low.&quot;&quot;&quot;
