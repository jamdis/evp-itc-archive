&gt; People come and go as they wish. If you are looking for someone in
&gt; particular you can try emailing them. There were a lot of issues and
&gt; inhouse arguments but that seems to be prevalent in this field. Sometimes
&gt; peoples opinions outweigh the need to work with others or even hear what
&gt; someone else believes. This board has and always will be a place to share
&gt; your experiences, and try to meet some likeminded individuals.
