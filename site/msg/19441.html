<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The one you have is the best one made, it is used for skywatching because it
has no need for external light.  It is used by many UFO buffs to comb the
night skies.

&gt; well umm I think Bill over charged you for something that should come with
&gt; it...I got it directly from the guy who make them....Skywatching one????
&gt; there is not one called that??
&gt;  this is the one I have...its $340 its the best one out there but you can
&gt; get by with a cheaper one....By the way this needs no light at all as a
&gt; matter of fact the makers suggest as little light as possible..when using it
&gt; in no light it looks like its day light its amazing!! the stuff we have seen
&gt; on this is WOW
&gt; http://www.spectercam.com/apps/webstore/products/show/1688631
&gt;
&gt; and this is the mount, i got with it....
&gt; http://www.spectercam.com/apps/webstore/products/show/1789548
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; These of course can be used with watching for ufo but its designed for
&gt; paranormal...

&gt; I don&#x27;t know the exact model numbers without looking them up, we got the
&gt; one with 6 IR light and one with IR &amp; UV lights.  We bought them from Bill
&gt; Murphy at Rolling Hills.  He charged extra for the power supply.
&gt;
&gt; I may buy the skywatching one, but $300 + is a lot of cash......

&gt; This is the one we use dfor dvr..I got a amazing deal on mine on ebay it
&gt; came with the docking station,mini dvr and the in and out station for 200..i
&gt; don&#x27;t think they guy knew what he had..because if you buy all the stuff
&gt; alone it can cost..so I was thrilled to get all the docking stations with it
&gt; out the door and it recorder on a memory card..I&#x27;m getting a full dvr system
&gt; in Feb...also I got the battery pack the spectracam that is offer on the
&gt; site..and the tripod device that is simply the coolest thing you can hang it
&gt; on anything trees curtains you name it is soooo much better then a regular
&gt; tripod.
&gt;
&gt;  Tim I don&#x27;t think I got a extra power supply...everything came with
&gt; mine..but like I said i have the spectrumCam 3..dont no if that makes a
&gt; difference..which one do you have??

&gt;
&gt; Agreed, it is the best camera to get.  There are several models available:
&gt; some have built in IR lights, some have IR / UV lights, some are set-up for
&gt; sky watching, and others are just plain ol&#x27; full spectrum.
&gt;
&gt; With this camera (depending on the model, a regular one with the different
&gt; options run around $120-150), you will also need the power supply ($12-$20),
&gt; a tripod, and a portable recorder.  My group uses 2 of them and each one is
&gt; attached to a portable DVD recorder that has a small LCD screen, you can
&gt; find these refurbished for under $100.

&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I want to get a full spectrum camera. My hubby is going to get me one for
&gt; my Yule gift. I want a good one that captures apparitions. Does anyone here
&gt; use one with success? Or know which one is a good one?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
