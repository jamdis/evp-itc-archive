&gt; Hi Debbie,
&gt;  
&gt; My experience is that it may or may not be the same entities.
&gt;  
&gt; I know that does not answer your question, let me explain.
&gt; If you are an established researcher with an assigned technician
&gt; most likely it will predominantly be the same spirit that is 
communicating.
&gt;  
&gt; There will also be other spirits that will come through with their 
individual messages of course
&gt; but your tech/guide will dominate the communication.
&gt;  
&gt; There are a couple of reasons you would get different sounding 
spirit communication
&gt; the first being that at all different times of the day different 
radio stations are broadcasting
&gt; a myriad of different sounds. The entities trying to communicate 
will use whatever fragments 
&gt; of sound they need to form the message and the sound signal changes 
from second to second.
&gt;  
&gt; Thus the different sounding voices. The second reason is each 
different box will produce it&#x27;s own unique
&gt; sound such as the minibox as apposed to the super radio each 
produce a distinctive sound.
&gt;  
&gt; Lastly, if you are new to box research you may not have a permanent 
tech/guide assigned yet and who ever is available
&gt; at the time of your session will take control of that session. I 
find that your tech does not bother to seek out recognisable 
&gt; noise fragments to form his or her message until you have developed 
a working relationship as well as a personal one with them.
&gt;  
&gt; There is no exact explanation for any of this, it is all conjecture 
by the individual researcher but I try to answer any questions based 
on my experience.
&gt;  
&gt; I hope this answer helps. Please feel free to ask any thing at any 
time and I&#x27;ll do my best to help.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone find that each &quot;Box&quot; has a different group of people 
speaking and helping?I&#x27;ve swept &quot;Manually&quot;, used the &quot;MiniBox&quot; and 
the &quot;SuperBox&quot; and there seems to be a different set of people on 
each device. Thanks,Debbie
