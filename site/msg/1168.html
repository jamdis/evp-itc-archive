&gt; Ken, the mantis head beings also appear purple. The color image 
halfway 
&gt; down the page is similar to what I witnessed along with several 
other 
&gt; people during a meditation excercise that was the lead in to a 
&gt; dimensional portal building workshop.
&gt; 
&gt;  Frank, when you mentioned the &quot;purples&quot; to me while I was in CO, I 
&gt; immediately thought of my experience but your description was 
&gt; different. My encounter was with a mantis head being.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards, Bill Murphy
&gt; 
&gt; p.s. we&#x27;ve been operating and recording some box sessions. During 
our 
&gt; first sessions, the box seemed to be calling your name like it did 
when 
&gt; we visited you. Through verbally stated intention, I communicated 
that 
&gt; you have provided me with the box for continued research. Our last 
two 
&gt; sessions began by my name being announced by the box. It&#x27;s almost 
as if 
&gt; the spirit technicians (or etheral beings) now recognize my energy 
&gt; signature being imprinted in this particular box.
