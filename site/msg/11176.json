There are many methods, many tools, and I would say the ghost box devices are a great tool to use.\n\nHeres one I recorded recently doing sweep tuning on my fm card. Kind of pertains to this conversation and I was just sharing it with a friend. Attaching it to this post its too long of a filename wise to post here in file section. I might upload it to my esnips for those who dont get individual emails.\n\nMisty\n\n\n--- On Tue, 6/3/08, threadsintyme@... &lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: threadsintyme@... &lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Misty, water sounds\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, June 3, 2008, 12:48 PM\n&gt; Hi Misty,\n&gt; Thank you for your suggestions...I would never have thought\n&gt; of that on my own! That would reduce all of the &quot;ghost\n&gt; phones&quot; to simply being tools rather than devices to\n&gt; communicate with a spirit.\n&gt; There is a small group of us (paranormal investigators) in\n&gt; Muskegon, MI. We have had some interesting success with\n&gt; photographs. In a month I am taking them in an entirely new\n&gt; direction: using your body as a tool for ghost hunting. And\n&gt; not for protection, either! LOL. \n&gt; This would fit right in with this idea of using some sort\n&gt; of white noise...even in the field.Or at least, it will\n&gt; give them something to really chew on! \n&gt; (The Other) Al\n&gt; \n&gt; -- &lt;alofbama@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re the only person I&#39;ve heard mention this, and\n&gt; it makes me feel better knowing I&#39;m not crazy (at keast\n&gt; totally). lol Long ago I noticed that running tap water\n&gt; sometimes seems to sound like garbled speech. I never\n&gt; tested this with a recorder, but I&#39;ve caught some evps\n&gt; with refrigerator motors and other devices. Audacity has\n&gt; the &quot;add white noise&quot; option, which allows you to\n&gt; record directly to your computer and allow the entities to\n&gt; organize the generic white noise. I&#39;m eager to try\n&gt; that. An excellent observation you had, Misty. I think they\n&gt; must grab hold of any babbling or whirring noise available\n&gt; to communicate, whether we&#39;re able to pick it up or\n&gt; not. That&#39;s why I carry around one of the lightweight\n&gt; Olympus recorders -- no telling where you&#39;re going to\n&gt; find a babbling-brook or steady motor sound.

Best advice one cold give is try\n&gt; it \n&gt; yourself for a while and see what you come up with =)\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com,\n&gt; &quot;threadsintyme@...&quot; \n&gt; &lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why do you need to &quot;sweep&quot; the AM spectrum? \n&gt; &gt; Has anyone tried this but without sweeps on the\n&gt; shortwave band? Has \n&gt; any research been done? Could it be that the AM band has\n&gt; some sort \n&gt; of &quot;special properties&quot; that would allow such\n&gt; communication? \n&gt; &gt; Why is it that the AM band has to be used with a radio\n&gt; station \n&gt; playing? There are parts of the spectrum that is just\n&gt; outside of that \n&gt; spectrum that might provide a better form of communication.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Al\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Click here for great computer networking solutions!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; http://thirdpartyoffers.juno.com/TGL2131/fc/Ioyw6iighEHwMAbLKMUuYo359E\n&gt; 28alDzNnXaMa5yrqURXjmUoY4EK4/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Netscape.
