Whether it is the beliefs they had which were their trade=\r\nmark, the tone of voice, their image, or use of some nickname even I dont k=\r\nnow about I look at it all as just a pixel in a larger portrait that some p=\r\nart survives once the body has ceased to function.

So=\r\n yes quite possibly evp work can \n            be used the same as mediumshi=\r\np in missing persons cases.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n            &lt;BR&gt;&gt; For me tone of vo=\r\nice has grown to mean nothing. It is a \n            treat when they manage =\r\nto come across sounding as they did when in \n            physical form here=\r\n but I look beyond the tone of voice. Often people \n            get a child=\r\ns voice and they become saddened by the thought that a \n            child i=\r\ns earthbound. But I see it just as a representation of voice \n            a=\r\nnd whether it comes across as male female child or robot matters \n         =\r\n   little to me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I do find they often resume the \n        =\r\n    &quot;character&quot; they played because after all that is sort of what we \n    =\r\n        are, characters in some giant play. Whether it is the beliefs they =\r\n\n            had which were their trademark, the tone of voice, their image=\r\n, or \n            use of some nickname even I dont know about I look at it =\r\nall as just \n            a pixel in a larger portrait that some part surviv=\r\nes once the body \n            has ceased to function. And the message is si=\r\nmply, our energy \n            continues on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Quote by Einst=\r\nein: &#39;Energy cannot be \n            created or destroyed, it can only be ch=\r\nanged from one form to \n            another.&#39;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Misty (the i=\r\nnsomniac is up way tooooo \n            late and rambling on LOL)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; --- On Tue, 9/15/09, \n            mrscaptainjack2 &lt;jjkamp@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n            From: mrscaptainjack2 &lt;jj=\r\nkamp@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] \n            Voice inflections?&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; To: &lt;A \n            href=3D&quot;http://us.mc329.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?=\r\nto=3DEVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; \n            rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank=\r\n \n            ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogro=\r\nups \n            .com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Tuesday, September 15, 2009, 9:56 P=\r\nM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n            &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I was googling about AM r=\r\nadio reception, \n            and I came across the below exchange on a foru=\r\nm. It talks about \n            using the box to find missing persons (which=\r\n I didn&#39;t know was \n            possible), and the conversation mentions he=\r\naring specific voice \n            inflections and recognizing a dead person=\r\n&#39;s specific voice on the \n            box. My question is, do any of you ge=\r\nt a recognizable voice? The \n            voices I get always sound robotic,=\r\n although I do get clearly male or \n            female voices. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.itcbridg/&quot; \n            rel=3Dnofollow target=\r\n=3D_blank&gt;http://www.itcbridg&lt;/A&gt; e.com/forum/ \n            view_topic. php=\r\n?id=3D515&amp; forum_id=3D \n          31&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCK=\r\nQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;!--End group email --&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0234_01CA36E5.EB240EE0--"}
