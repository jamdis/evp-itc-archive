&gt; Here&#x27;s a recording I made with EVP Maker using a sound file that was
&gt; originally created for learning a foreign language. I don&#x27;t know what
&gt; language it is. You can hear my dog in the background panting and shaking.
&gt; He has tags on his collar that rattle when he shakes. You can also hear
&gt; birds outside where I had my window open, but that&#x27;s not until near the end.
&gt; 
&gt; Here&#x27;s what I think I can hear so far. Comments are welcome!
&gt; 
&gt; :02 Yeah, Bob&#x27;s in here (my father-in-law and brother-in-law, both deceased,
&gt; are named Bob)
&gt; :11 It&#x27;s on the topic
&gt; :25 Ghost box (this is a spoken EVP, not in the original recording)
&gt; :42 It&#x27;s a secret from ... (i don&#x27;t understand the rest)
&gt; 1:07 It predicted in...(don&#x27;t understand)
&gt; 1:25 Throw out this box! (this is a spoken EVP, not in the original
&gt; recording.)
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ll be doing more of these to see what I can get. I have another one I
&gt; haven&#x27;t analyzed yet, but I&#x27;ll post it soon.
