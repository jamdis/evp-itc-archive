I got some pretty convincing images. I posted a few of them in my folder so check them out if you want and let me know what you think. I will send better resolution images. If you want them, send me an email. I will also make the movie file available on request. It is up at YouTube, but its boring and the quality lacks on there. Hope you enjoy and comment on the pictures. Here&#39;s the link to my folder:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Chad%27s%20EVPs%20and%20Files/%20WATER%20METHOD/\n\nThanks,\n\nChad"}
