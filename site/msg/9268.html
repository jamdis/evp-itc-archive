<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I completely agree with this, Bruce. I&#x27;ve already stated why, but  
I&#x27;ll say again: it&#x27;s not your Karma; it may be the only way some  
people can get a box; it creates hatred and negativity; your energy  
is better spent elsewhere.

Ask the people and entities talking to you from your own hacks what  
they want you to do. I&#x27;ll bet you&#x27;ll hear something along the lines  
of be still and know that all is very well.

&gt; Rhonda,

&gt; Everyone is misunderstanding my point.
&gt; my whole post was about stopping any furtherance of the negative
&gt; vibrations this issue was already causing and that would have been  
&gt; empowered by
&gt; an attempt to sabotage this idiot on ebay.
&gt;
&gt; I am the first to advocate putting out information on hacking your  
&gt; own box and educating people about our research
&gt; and to be aware of the snake oil salesman that are lurking in the  
&gt; shadows.
&gt;
&gt; Most of the uneducated people that are seeing a box or information  
&gt; about one, right now are doing so mainly because
&gt; of the publicity the box received on the tv show paranormal state.  
&gt; So I believe that when a new individual is begging a
&gt; search for knowledge about what is being done with this method,  
&gt; they are not going to go to ebay first for their initial source
&gt; of information they may visit ebay after they derive their initial  
&gt; information and decide to get involved with our work.
&gt; But I think their first venue for knowledge would be a google  
&gt; search, I know that&#x27;s what mine was.
&gt;
&gt; All I was trying to say was that there are much more suitable  
&gt; places for these individuals to have access to the information
&gt; you want to put on ebay, and lets face it, the initial reaction to  
&gt; this whole thing was not the concern of the people getting the boxes,
&gt; it was to stop the asshole that was selling the boxes. Which  
&gt; actually &quot;If you cut off the head of the snake&quot; still in all the  
&gt; immediate
&gt; emotion was one of anger and subversion of this individual. That in  
&gt; itself brings negative vibration to the field, it&#x27;s the ripple in  
&gt; the pond affect.
&gt;
&gt; Also I believe that people that have decide to start their hunt for  
&gt; a box and wind up at ebay, already have the mindset to buy the box  
&gt; if they see it.
&gt; And if they see the actual box for sale and then see an  
&gt; advertisement that is just that and not the actual box, chances are  
&gt; they will concentrate on the actual box
&gt; and ignore the advert.
&gt;
&gt; If we feel as a group that something needs to be done, we should  
&gt; try and reach these people before they get to ebay at all! If we  
&gt; can come up with an education campaign that
&gt; utilizes all obvious venues of paranormal information which is the  
&gt; first spot anyone will look, then count me in 100%
&gt;
&gt; But as far as launching a campaign against this one sad individual  
&gt; under the guise of helping people not get swindled, I know for  
&gt; myself and I am being completely truthful with you and myself
&gt; my first motivation would be to stick it to this guy and if I  
&gt; helped some people avoid a bad deal in doing that all the better.  
&gt; So that&#x27;s what I meant by negativity attached to the box.
&gt;
&gt; Lets get the word out to the paranormal community and they will  
&gt; steer the inquiries our way. That&#x27;s when we really can help.

&gt;
&gt; Bruce,
&gt;
&gt; But didnt you say that those boxes that ebay guy was over charging  
&gt; for would come with negative energy attached to them?  If that was  
&gt; the case, wouldnt we want to prevent them from being spread  
&gt; around?  How can we do that if we &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;?  Not  
&gt; tryin to stir the pot, Im just curious...I think the post giving  
&gt; free info on hacking your own RS boxes would be better than an  
&gt; attack of emails and comments on the guys page and would also be  
&gt; better than doing nothing....
&gt;
&gt; BUT on the otherhand...wouldnt this give those money hungry people  
&gt; out there a way to overcharge and take from innocent people...those  
&gt; kind of people would then turn around and post their hacked boxes  
&gt; on ebay and then we would see an outbreak of over charging and  
&gt; innocent people being taken advantage of...hmmm its kinda a catch  
&gt; 22......damned if ya do and damned if ya dont!

&gt; Margaret,
&gt;
&gt; In my initial reply I voiced my disdain for low lives that take  
&gt; advantage of unwary people
&gt; but did not advocate any action by any researchers on this board.
&gt;
&gt; My goal is not just pacifism for it&#x27;s own sake, believe me any of  
&gt; the old timers here can attest to my temper.
&gt; My concern is for the negative disruption in the energy flow of the  
&gt; communication.
&gt; I think that following the example of &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; will  
&gt; be very well received on the other side and therefore
&gt; contribute to strengthening the bridge.
&gt;
&gt; In the past couple of days I know Kristin has received messages  
&gt; about the seven and the circle,
&gt; these are metaphors for peace, harmony and cooperation of energies  
&gt; within the communication.
&gt;
&gt; It is not the first time we have received messages with these  
&gt; examples, I personally have received numerous
&gt; messages pertaining to circle, circles and the power of seven. It  
&gt; has been contemplated in length here more than once.
&gt;
&gt; I have, through interpretation of communication over a long period  
&gt; of time, come to PERSONALLY believe that the urgence of
&gt; harmony and positive energy is the fertilizer of the growth of our  
&gt; communication with the spirit world.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m sorry, I drifted off the subject at hand, but my reason is  
&gt; relevant to this commentary.
&gt; Taking any action against this ebay fool will first and foremost  
&gt; serve our ego&#x27;s and secondly
&gt; may help to provide information to unwary buyers that is contrary  
&gt; to what this thief is putting out.
&gt;
&gt; But could that not be accomplished through other venues that would  
&gt; help to educate many more people that
&gt; are would be box researchers and do not look to ebay as a source  
&gt; for an RS hack. But are seeking general knowledge.
&gt;
&gt; And Margaret to thine own self be true, when this was brought up my  
&gt; first reaction was to figure out a way to sabotage
&gt; this guy&#x27;s business venture. After thinking it over and asking  
&gt; myself what the first reason for doing that would be. My answer
&gt; Was, to get this asshole that is exploiting something that I hold  
&gt; very dear, and in turn help to steer unaware buyers away from  
&gt; getting screwed.
&gt;
&gt; But still my initial and primal reason was to inflict some sort of  
&gt; punishment on a person that I felt was unscrupulous. And I decided  
&gt; that this was
&gt; a negative emotion and would generate negative energy, no matter  
&gt; how I tried to convince myself it was in the name of justice.
&gt;
&gt; That goes without even mentioning the fact that we are not the say  
&gt; all and do all of this research. There are other entities involved  
&gt; that I would think
&gt; have better influential power than we do. If they want it stopped  
&gt; they will find a way to stop it. I know what your going to say,  
&gt; maybe we are the
&gt; tools they are using to stop this injustice. That may very well be,  
&gt; and if so then that is the way it will play out.
&gt;
&gt; I think you mistake what I am implying. I am not saying do nothing,  
&gt; quite the opposite. It is actually our duty to do something. All  
&gt; I&#x27;m saying is there
&gt; are alternative ways to educate unwary possible researchers that  
&gt; would be 100% positive and not entail any type of stone throwing  
&gt; tactics.
&gt;
&gt; I have said my piece now at the expense of boring everyone to  
&gt; death. So I will see how this unfolds, and during my daily session  
&gt; will inquire about how our friends feel about it.

&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: My opinion on what should be done about  
&gt; ebay_I know it&#x27;s long but please rea
&gt;
&gt; Hi Bruce. I don&#x27;t see this so much as an assault on anyone, as it  
&gt; is simply bringing
&gt; awareness into a forum (ebay) where it is desperately needed.
&gt;
&gt; Was it not you who recently stated sellers who take advantage of  
&gt; others in this way are &quot;no
&gt; more than thieves without guns&quot; and &quot;should not be patronized no  
&gt; matter the
&gt; circumstances.&quot; You have characterized them as &quot;wolves&quot; and  
&gt; &quot;demons&quot; but now are
&gt; saying &quot;do nothing.&quot; Which, honestly, I could understand if my  
&gt; suggestion was coming
&gt; from a place of vengeance. It is not.
&gt;
&gt; THIS IS ABOUT EDUCATION FIRST AND FOREMOST, and standing up for  
&gt; those who are,
&gt; unknowingly, being taken advantage of. The byproduct of providing  
&gt; this education will be
&gt; allowing consumers to make an informed decision and if that hurts  
&gt; the sales of
&gt; unscrupulous sellers, then so be it.
&gt;
&gt; Ann has just echoed some of my remarks in earlier posts in support  
&gt; of sellers rights to
&gt; take advantage of the market ... that some people may find it&#x27;s  
&gt; worth it to pay more to
&gt; someone to receive a previously hacked unit.
&gt;
&gt; I would venture to guess, this educational information will A) help  
&gt; prevent those who are
&gt; capable of doing the hack themselves from being duped, and B) force  
&gt; sellers who do offer
&gt; pre-hacked units to do so for a more &#x27;reasonable&#x27; fee.
&gt;
&gt; This is neither spiteful nor aggressive, and it&#x27;s certainly not any  
&gt; kind of vengeance driven
&gt; on my part. It&#x27;s standing up for the uninformed, leveling the  
&gt; playing field for sellers, and
&gt; it&#x27;s bringing more people the knowledge that doing &#x27;box&#x27; research  
&gt; is not an exclusive club
&gt; that only the rich can take part in (and given the pricing on the  
&gt; bids for these units,
&gt; people are under the false assumption that you have a pay a high  
&gt; price to get your hands
&gt; on a limited resource, when that simply is not the case.)
&gt;
&gt; I can see nothing but positive benefits coming from educating  
&gt; people about their options.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have been reading the back and forth posts about ideas on how to
&gt; &gt; deal with the individual selling the hacks on ebay for inflated
&gt; &gt; prices.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I posted my thoughts on that individual yesterday. I would now like
&gt; &gt; to render my opinion as to the subject of what we or anyone can do
&gt; &gt; about it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My suggestion is DO NOTHING! Now before everybody&#x27;s jaw hits the
&gt; &gt; floor, hear me out.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A couple of months ago I would have been the one to lead the charge
&gt; &gt; in the assault on this guy in the name of box justice.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I can now say with confidence, That is not the way to handle it.
&gt; &gt; Let me explain why I believe this way. Without going into a lot of
&gt; &gt; detail, I was a tough street kid that grew up on the streets of
&gt; &gt; Brooklyn, I also served my country proudly for six years as a us  
&gt; army
&gt; &gt; green beret, then to a career as a FDNY Fireman whose heart and
&gt; &gt; health where both broken at 911.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My point is, I have always lived my life believing that anything I
&gt; &gt; did not agree with or that did not fit my sense of right and wrong
&gt; &gt; whether it be right or wrong, could be easily solved with aggression
&gt; &gt; of some kind.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It took a long while and much sole searching and a lot of
&gt; &gt; communication interpretation from our friends on the other side.
&gt; &gt; But I have come to learn that aggressive action in any form is
&gt; &gt; detrimental to the harmony and peace of the whole involved.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Guy&#x27;s like this guy on ebay do not and can not last in the face of
&gt; &gt; good and well intentioned people that are here and willing and  
&gt; trying
&gt; &gt; to get the word of this miraculous research and spirit communication
&gt; &gt; out to as many people as are in need or want of it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That is how we can stop people like this bottom feeder. By spreading
&gt; &gt; the knowledge of this research from one person to the next. Our
&gt; &gt; friends have stated time and time again that any negative energy  
&gt; will
&gt; &gt; be detrimental to the communication and the research, and positive
&gt; &gt; harmony and vibration will serve to strengthen the bridge between  
&gt; our
&gt; &gt; worlds.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So even if you are not religious and do not believe in Jesus Christ
&gt; &gt; as I do, these words ring true no matter what context they come from
&gt; &gt; this wisdom was spoken by my lord two thousand years ago.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &quot;do not check the splinter in your brothers eye, until you have
&gt; &gt; checked the plank in your own&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Truthfully, anything we could do to sway this individuals sale of
&gt; &gt; these boxes would be minimal. Negativity and greed always find a
&gt; &gt; crack to seep through.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My suggestion is lets try a little harder to spread the word of the
&gt; &gt; research and educate individuals that are or may become interested,
&gt; &gt; through all the various outlets available to us on the web  
&gt; concerning
&gt; &gt; the paranormal research community. There are endless chat boards,
&gt; &gt; groups and forums plus websites and word of mouth.
&gt; &gt; Instead of trying to stop this idiot from defrauding innocent
&gt; &gt; unknowledgable people. Lets make sure the knowledge is out there for
&gt; &gt; them and we are here to help them and guy&#x27;s like Mr. ebay will
&gt; &gt; disappear on their own.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And we will not have expended an ounce of negative energy in the
&gt; &gt; process.
&gt; &gt; That&#x27;s how I feel, but that&#x27;s just me.
