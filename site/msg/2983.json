I have strong convictions regarding the boxes, having been up close and personal (shall we say) on several different occasions.  I have analyzed EVP from many locations and still strongly believe that the box does not work for everyone.  I believe that your intentions are good giving our conversations in the past and wish you the very best with assembly.\n   \n  See, I believe that the guilds know what your intentions are, and the sincerity behind your work and come through to those who have their best interest at heart.  I know that you probably think I am crazy, but in viewing some who currently posses the devices and having changed their path for their own agenda, its not going to be what they in vision it to be.  I think they could open Pandora Box and the world in which they know it will come crashing down upon their own accord.\n   \n  I know the other side knows, and will help those in furthering their studies as they see fit.  I can only say, that the respect I have for the boxes and Frank will always remain, and I can lay my head upon my pillow at night with my integrity in take.  When I should have a box, I will know, and until then, I have the pleasure to listen and read everyones data and studies!\n   \n  Juli\n   \n  \n\nZack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt; wrote:\n          \nHi Juli,\n\nGood to see you here!\n\nFrank has graciously provided the schematics and other data for building \none.
