I will ask my guide, D=

      Considering the attacks people continue t=

        me on here just for having a different opinion of p=
eople's results, I 
        think you will understand why I will not post m=

        here.

Try anyway though.=C2=A0 I don't know ho=
w your personal 
        beliefs here work, but others seem to get messages=
 about people they've 
        never heard of, or places they've never seen=
.

I would also 
        suggest anyone who tries this experiment, to post =
your results on the 
        list here rather than sending them personally =
to me - so I won't be 
        accused of losing any.

            7/14/2010.

All you have to do i=

            aliens/etc, what it is.

I have take=
n a picture of it, and 
            posted it to the files section here, so=
 there is no way I can squirm 
            out of the results:

Please do not try to 
            open the file before noon Wednesday. B=
ut feel free to download it to 
            your computer beforehand, so yo=
u can be sure I won't change it 
            during, or after, the test.

A=
