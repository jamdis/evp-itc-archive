&gt; Good point LC.   You did get responses that the whole group could 
witness and participate in.  I would guess the outcome would be quite 
different for participants if the message could only be heard by the 
conductor or the messages were not readily discernible.  I am not 
doing group presentations...yet...and I would hesitate at this point 
to share a session with other than my wife, who already knows I&#x27;m out 
there.  Cheers   Ron L

&gt; 
&gt; When I ran a group (5 of us) session two weeks ago, I had members 
of 
&gt; the group formulate questions and I did the asking for about an 8 
&gt; minute session or so. They could not hear the responses aloud, as I 
&gt; had the audio piped directly into a mixer, then outputted to the 
&gt; recorder (but I could hear &amp; had on headphones to listen in).
&gt; 
&gt; I immediately then uploaded the audio to my laptop, and began 
playing 
&gt; the audio aloud, allowing the group to help me analyze what we had 
&gt; captured. We received great messages that were not lower level, but 
&gt; sentences of information (not just &quot;hi,&quot; &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; etc). 
&gt; 
&gt; So, I would like to add to this discussion that group sessions can 
&gt; work well, but it may depend on how you do it and what the 
intentions 
&gt; are.

&gt; &gt; Hi Steve Just to jump in with a friendly point of view. I was 
&gt; really appreciative of you providing the videos on the boxes. One 
&gt; reason for my excitement is because I wanted to see the new RS 125 
&gt; that I have ordered. The other reason was because I want to 
&gt; introduce a techie type friend to this whole phenomena and I 
thought 
&gt; your presentation would be a good starting point. After watching 
&gt; your video you satisfied my first interest, but I chose not to 
refer 
&gt; my friend to the video. I found the video to be very interesting 
&gt; and I was only a little disappointed that responses to your 
questions 
&gt; did not come across to my ear. But I could only imagine how a 
newbie 
&gt; like my friend would react. Even though he is a techie, I think he 
&gt; would have wanted to HEAR something from the other side. I felt 
that 
&gt; someone who did not previously know about the successful sessions 
&gt; that so many researchers have had here, would have experienced a 
guy 
&gt; talking to himself or, worse yet, asking
&gt; &gt; questions to a radio and then answering himself. Again, I think 
&gt; someone who takes the time to see such a presentation also wants to 
&gt; see the results. After all, getting a message from the other end is 
&gt; the purpose of what&#x27;s being done. Audience expectations should not 
&gt; be underestimated. Hope this helps. Thanks again for the 
&gt; videos. Ron L

&gt; &gt; I appreciate the concern, however i have learned from the past 
&gt; &gt; experience. I was going to go and do a brief background on my 
&gt; &gt; limited time so far in ITC and box research and maybe turn the 
&gt; &gt; different devices on for those to hear how each one sounds. I 
&gt; &gt; probably wasn&#x27;t going to ask questions due to the halloween event 
&gt; &gt; when i received no spiritual contacts, but that wasn&#x27;t a meeting 
&gt; &gt; either where i could explain what i was doing. I also am going to 
&gt; &gt; bring the 4 spare hacked 470 radios i have to offer to potential 
&gt; &gt; future researchers. Nothing is etched in stone yet with me going, 
i 
&gt; &gt; have to contact them first and see if that&#x27;s what they want. I 
was 
&gt; &gt; supposed to go in November, but declined because i wasn&#x27;t ready 
to 
&gt; &gt; display yet. Now, there is so many different radios out there 
that 
&gt; i 
&gt; &gt; can offer the idea for those who wish to approach this research 
&gt; with 
&gt; &gt; an open mind.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Steve,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I listened to the file, It could have said what is labeled.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It was kinda rough and I don&#x27;t think anyone but an experienced
&gt; &gt; &gt; researcher used to listening to Frank&#x27;s box would hear anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; from the random mode especially.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think you may have gotten caught up in the moment, I know 
those 
&gt; &gt; group sessions can get exciting.
&gt; &gt; &gt; My advice would be to hold off on any public display sessions 
&gt; until 
&gt; &gt; we refine the communivation to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; where the average listener is capable of hearing a response. 
&gt; Don&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt; forget what happened on halloween in staten Island.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Or what happened to those knuckle heads at pulse radio.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it would be detrimental to the research not to go 
&gt; somewhere 
&gt; &gt; and have a group of people hear nothing but what 
&gt; &gt; &gt; they discern as noise. for the simple reason that they are not 
&gt; &gt; equiped to hear the actual responses.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just my opinion as afriend and fellow researcher. also I 
believe 
&gt; &gt; our friend Frank believes that the box was not meant 
&gt; &gt; &gt; for field work and does not perform to the best of it&#x27;s ability 
&gt; in 
&gt; &gt; a public situation.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been having weird sessions with Frank&#x27;s Box #27, but in 
a 
&gt; &gt; good way. They told me to change the antenna, which it did and 
the 
&gt; &gt; random started working and never has on this box. They told me 
&gt; &gt; tonight to put the old antenna back on and the sessions keep 
&gt; getting 
&gt; &gt; better and better. I dragged Juli and Joel in on what i believed 
&gt; and 
&gt; &gt; felt was going to be a great box session and here is a file only 
a 
&gt; &gt; couple minutes in to our hour long session. This is a bit rough 
&gt; &gt; sounding, but hearing it live is pretty clear and you can hear me 
&gt; &gt; respond and than Joel agrees that he heard it too. My sessions 
are 
&gt; &gt; pretty incredible since the random mode started working on the 
&gt; FB#27 
&gt; &gt; and i feel the random is the best thing out there...hands down. I 
&gt; &gt; have done Sessions on the internet through Skype all week and i 
&gt; feel 
&gt; &gt; the energy between Juli and I are really bringing them through 
&gt; &gt; clearly. I only use FB#27 now in random mode and it is the best 
&gt; &gt; feature on any box, between the white noise, echo and random 
there 
&gt; is 
&gt; &gt; no competetion up to this point. The hacks are good, but nothing 
is 
&gt; &gt; better than an original frank&#x27;s box. Our friends on the other 
side 
&gt; &gt; told me that they fixed the random mode to go and teach others 
and 
&gt; i 
&gt; &gt; am going to a meeting on wednesday to demonstrate the different 
&gt; boxes 
&gt; &gt; and our friend made a promise to come though if i go....so we 
will 
&gt; &gt; see.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Here is one of the files i got so far.
