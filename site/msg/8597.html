<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Stefan.  Thank you for sharing your observations.  This would be in line with the 
experimental indications of traditional EVP being formed inside the unit, as evidenced by 
digital recorders which have had their internal mic removed, yet can still record voice.  

I started thinking about acoustics when I jumped into the world of radio sweep.  I noted a 
big difference between sweep and traditional EVP, in that with traditional EVP methods, it 
is quite rare for the same EVP to be heard at the same time when multiple recorders are 
running simultaneously.  However, with sweep, I have noticed that multiple units will 
indeed pick up the same messages, and in fact, when I have blended the tracks from the 
two separate units, the message at times was even clearer.  

Perhaps in the case of sweep and the like, the manipulation is actually taking place inside 
the radio, just as appears to be the case with various recorders in traditional EVP?  Since 
the same thing is heard on multiple units with sweep/EVPM, this leads me to believe that 
the change is taking place somewhere along the line prior to hitting the airwaves.  

This can all be so mind boggling!  ;0)

&gt; Hi Margret,
&gt; 
&gt; yes, acoustical soundwaves - this could of course be a possible focus
&gt; point for manipulation by &#x27;them&#x27;. However, I&#x27;m not sure if this really
&gt; takes place. Some time ago I had made some experiments to find out if
&gt; the sound is changed for EVPs. I compared the original signal to the
&gt; signal which had been transferred acoustically, and except for the
&gt; reverberations from the room etc. I could never hear any significant
&gt; differences; thus a manipulation of soundwaves did not take place and
&gt; seemed to be unnecessary for the production of EVP. This led me to the
&gt; conclusion that &#x27;they&#x27; usually don&#x27;t manipulate our physical
&gt; surrounding.

&gt; &gt; Hi Stefan and Steve. The closest thing I&#x27;ve gotten to an answer from
&gt; &gt; &quot;Arthur&quot; about how this is working is the words &#x27;air&#x27; or &#x27;air-to-air.&#x27;
&gt; &gt; This makes little sense to me, unless there is some type of additional
&gt; &gt; manipulation taking place acoustically, because I am not recording in
&gt; &gt; a closed environment. I am playing the file from EVP Maker using an
&gt; &gt; external speaker and recording using the built-in mic of my MAC.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have no idea, what, if any difference this might make in terms of
&gt; &gt; opportunity for &#x27;them&#x27; to speak intelligent phrases. Just thought I&#x27;d
&gt; &gt; share what I&#x27;m hearing. I&#x27;ll keep asking, and trying to get a clearer
&gt; &gt; explanation of the process (though I&#x27;ve never had much luck with that
&gt; &gt; in the past, in regard to getting explanations for the mechanics of
&gt; &gt; any other technique!)
