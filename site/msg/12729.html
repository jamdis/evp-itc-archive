Well replying to digest certainly makes sense.  I had to drop digest years ago because of that.

I was just having a hard time figuring out which responses were for which posts.
No biggie but I figured if I was having the problem, other would as well.  Plus 
a reply without the context is usually nonsensical so it does not help the understanding.

Again, just my perspective but I've found as I've gotten older that if I don't understand something there
is usually a dozen or more others that don't either that just did not ask.

Don

First of all Don, most of my replies are from my e-mail as I am 
either working in the lab at night, or in the field in the day time. 
It is rare that I actually have time to enter and hang out in any 
group to post messages. I respond to the daily digests. Sorry if 
there is trouble following my posts. I don't intend to cause 
confusion, just learn and share what I know. I was under the 
impression it was an EVP/ITC discussion group, and am merely trying 
to participate as I can. My appologies if it gets confusing.
