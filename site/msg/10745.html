&gt; I am not sure how it sounded live to you Frank but from the mp3 in 
&gt; your file the copper box is much cleaner and clearer sounding than 
&gt; the steel box. 
&gt; 
&gt; As soon as you get to the steel box on the file it sounds like it 
was 
&gt; covered with something which made it sound more muffled. I could 
also 
&gt; hear some sort of wind sound from the steel box.

&gt; &gt;  I wanted to compare the two boxes, I just finished a galvanized 
&gt; steel box, that scrap metal I get from work. I did the same as the 
&gt; copper box, try to select the best sounding speaker for it. The 
use 
&gt; it with #33. I like the steel box better, I think last night, the 
&gt; clearer voices had more to do with conditions thant he equipment. 
Or--
&gt; could it be the other way around, tonights conditions are poor for 
&gt; either box? It gets frustrating cuz ya can&#x27;t nail the damn stuff 
&gt; down, it seems to defy any attempts at definition. 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  I know, there was at least one person scrambling to make a 
copper 
&gt; box, that&#x27;s why I wanted more testing. I wish I could give some 
&gt; difinitive answers, but there just doens&#x27;t seem to be any.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  Then, get a voice that seems to be Raudive, I would expect some 
&gt; signifgiant difference with the copper box, I&#x27;m not hearing any 
thing 
&gt; any better. 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  BTW, the mp3s are in my folder.
