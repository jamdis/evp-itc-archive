Yeah I thought 12 meant  \n&gt; number and 5 meant 5th one. LOL just when ya think ya get it all  \n&gt; figured out.\n&gt;\n&gt; Heres a couple I got in my tests yesterday using the sweep tuning  \n&gt; method.\n&gt;\n&gt; Misty\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@ hotmail.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I think that voice was from a later box. I made two of these boxes  \n&gt; in a\n&gt; ttempt to make them smaller, and portable. The number a the begiing is\n&gt; usually the order received or heard. The other one is AM/FM, but  \n&gt; the AM\n&gt; tuner takes a screwy tuning voltage, so it doens&#39;t work right. I  \n&gt; want to\n&gt; just add a different AM tuner, and keep the FM tuner. That one has  \n&gt; the steel\n&gt; box too, but I don&#39;t remember if it&#39;s the wave guide box.\n&gt;\n&gt; All of the later Boxes are made so the Echo box can be easily  \n&gt; replaced, and\n&gt; some have front panel jacks to allow the use of other echo boxes. I  \n&gt; quite\n&gt; putting in those jacks, as most had no understanding of their use,  \n&gt; even if I\n&gt; explained it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;From: Misty Dawn\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; &gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Box 12\n&gt; &gt;Date: Wed, 11 Jul 2007 22:06:58 -0700 (PDT)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;#13 Doesnt look so ugly to me Frank. I think it would be cool if  \n&gt; it had the\n&gt; &gt;option for both but not a necessity. Is #12 the one you got my  \n&gt; name/voice\n&gt; &gt;on? &quot;this is Misty Dawn&quot; I still have that sound clip saved hehehe  \n&gt; I cant\n&gt; &gt;remember but the sound files had 12 at the start of it and i think  \n&gt; thats\n&gt; &gt;how you were numbering them at one point. I kinda remember 13&#39;s  \n&gt; tests but\n&gt; &gt;it wasnt around long enough to gather much info. Was around the  \n&gt; time when\n&gt; &gt;we tested video itc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyway heres the that file from that box 12 if it was indeed as  \n&gt; labled.\n&gt; &gt;Oh and if it is 12 then when u fix that one let&#39;s play with it a  \n&gt; bit before\n&gt; &gt;it goes anywhere LOL.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Misty\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Frank Sumption wrote:\n&gt; &gt; This is a box returned. I replaced the capacitors in the whithe\n&gt; &gt;noise amp\n&gt; &gt;that control the gain, and voila--kick butt box. This is one of  \n&gt; two that I\n&gt; &gt;tried &quot;ugly construction&quot; , where the components are mounted on an  \n&gt; unetched\n&gt; &gt;piece of copper clad board in an effort to reduce size. One  \n&gt; drawback with\n&gt; &gt;this box is it&#39;s AC powered, so not portable to places wihtout  \n&gt; power--like\n&gt; &gt;grave yards, so I might convert it. I have one more of these, #12,  \n&gt; but the\n&gt; &gt;tuner needs to be replaced.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Frank\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _\n&gt; &gt;Don&#39;t get caught with egg on your face.
