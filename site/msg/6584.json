The sweep was at about 1:30 and  \nthe signal strength at 12. If I turn the sweep up to 3, it sounds  \nlike gunfire from all the stations around here. Literally. Why do you  \nthink the sweep effected this? I confess that I have no clue what the  \nsweep rate does. I just know that I play with it until I start  \nhearing voices that seem to shout words like &quot;Purple,&quot; &quot;Seven&quot; and  \n&quot;Lisa&quot; and then we&#39;re golden.\n\nYou really don&#39;t hear that? I thought the majority of it was pretty  \nclear. The first couple words were shaky, maybe, the &quot;We&#39;re good!&quot;  \nand &quot;Okay&quot; were loud enough that I hear it in real time and answered.  \nDid you hear it differently?\n\nHmmmmmm.
