[1 Attachment]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; [Attachment(s) from Frank Sumption included below] \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  Picked up another RCA alarm clock radio yesterday for $3. It&#39;s\n&gt; hackable, although I&#39;ll convert it to a box tuner by removing the\n&gt; processor board. Cost is the motivator, this tuner is $3, ---for the TRF\n&gt; box, just the tuning diodes are $6, the TRF chip $1.50( i think), the\n&gt; pcb board $20, plus maybe $20 for the rest of the parts, and that&#39;s not\n&gt; including assembly. Trouble is, I can&#39;t find a ready supply of re-usable\n&gt; tuners. This sounds alot better after it&#39;s converted. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  frank-S\n&gt;"}
