Hey Mike,

I find Ghost Adventures on Friday night entertaining. They have =
a little fun with it and don't take themselves so seriously. LOL

think?


Greetings fellow researchers,

(Remember, what follows is opinion.=
.. so please be gentle)

Well, the new TruTV series, Door to the Dead aired=
 last night. I 
recorded it with my DVR so I could watch and review the pro=
gram video 
a bit better than just watching it live.
So... what did I think=
 of Door to the Dead?
Let me say this... the first episode was more enterta=
ining than Ghost 
Hunters, G.H.I., Paranormal State, and even that other on=
e where the 
guy and his team get locked over night in places (I can't thin=
k of 
the name right now). Note: I don't watch any of them anymore, even 
t=
hough I did give them all a try at least once or twice.

Anyway, although I=
 had some problem with the entity 'orbs' portion of 
the Door to the Dead i=
nvestigation, since I may have seen an 'orb 
source' when I put the DVR in =
super slow motion, the rest of the 
series was put together nicely, with a =
good story line, good 
interaction of characters, and some very entertainin=
g and interesting 
methods used for the variety of investigative tactics.

=
Unlike G.H., G.H.I., Paranormal State, and that other one, I'll 
probably w=
atch 'Door to the Dead' again to see how it pans out. The 
new TruTV series=
 caught my attention.
