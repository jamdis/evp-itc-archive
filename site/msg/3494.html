 Thanks! Now I think we should let the results, and contacts talk for them=

ct: RE: [EVP-ITC] Just the fact!


 I did, from the begining open this to a=
nyone, and I am not amused that one person would take the technogoly, claim=
 it as his own, and attempt to make it exclusive to himself. For one person=
 to say he is the "primary tester" is inaccurate, he was the first that kin=
da understood how it was supposed to be used, or so I thought. I think we l=
eft the "treting phase" some time ago, perhaps it's time to return barrowed=
 equipment?  I wasn't quite finished with that e-mail-- I hit the send butt=
on in my rush to get off to work.     I put out a box use guideline thing a=
 year or two ago stating that no one has the right to take my equipment and=
 and claim their use supercedes anyones else's use, or results. So, to cont=
iue...  As a far as "technicians" I don't get any of that stuff, but---they=
 do talk about a network, and connection to our equipment. When I first mad=
e my "Ghostman" box, last week, it wasn't working well, but a day or so lat=
er, it came to life, and one of the voices said it had been connected to "t=
he network". Supposedly there is a similar connection made to computers run=
ning EVPmaker. I'm not sure if these "network" connections are maintained i=
f equipment is taken out for investigations, or demostrations. Of cousre, I=
 can't say if these networks are a fact. I would think as maker of the box,=
 these etheric techs might want to give me, or others some hints.  As far a=
s the ghost box, or Frank's box, being a "telephone to the dead", I think i=
s very poor analogy, the old style phone system of Edison's day had operato=
rs, plural, not one person that recieved all calls, then interpreted what w=
as being said to other parties. That's more of a master control schema.The =
old phone system didn't charge you an arm and a leg to talk to someone in t=
he same room either! Some might say these "Technicains" are the operators, =
but even if anyone esle could hear these voices, why do you need someone to=
 interpret what's being said. I say if not many can hear it, or something s=
imilar, it ain't real! There is a certain kind of conatct, ion that that yo=
ur own mind uses the noise as a sort of psychic prop, you hear the stuff in=
 your head, it may be accurate and real inforamntiion, but no one else is g=
oing to hear it. i think that what all this supposed converstions wiht Edis=
on maybe.  I have in fact heard a voice that said "Edison here" but there w=
as no other real information conveyed that I could understand.  As for port=
als, demons and evil spirits entering the world through these "unauthorized=
" boxes, I an only say, as the original mker of the box, I have gotten voic=
es cuzzing, swearing, name calling, and even threatening, but nothing that =
has seemingly "entered" our world. Even those "threatening entities", when =
pressed to bring it, fold up like paper tigers. These beings and spirits al=
ready exist all around us, and at a higher level, so they have full access =
to this, a lower lever. Besides. There is that "network" that seem to allow=
 for better contacts, and kinda helps highter being to come through.   I ma=
de these "boxes"! The idea was not "Edisons Telephone..." What I got was an=
 assemblage of my own expereince and knowlegde, put together by my own mind=
 as answer to my question of what else could I use for spirit comuncation. =
All technology involved was based on what I had worked on in the past for r=
adio experimentation. I had in fact, a couple years before my interest in E=
VP, been experimenting with voltage tunable radio modules removed from car =
stereos for AM DX, that's listening to distant AM radio stations. I was hop=
ing to find other talk shows similar to Art Bell, and there used to be one =
out of Cincinati(?). The idea of using a random voltage to tune the radio w=
as after using EVPmaker, which uses a method of generating random speech bi=
ts for the entities to use. It was a small leap to apply the random techniq=
ue to an anolog system. I am not the first to be focusing on a problem, and=
 have the mind provide an solution in complete form. Nothing mystical about=
 it. The fact is, after much work, and experimenting, the tuning doesn't ha=
ve to be random, a linear tuning works much better. Yet another fact of  th=
e box, covienently ignored.  What really chaps my hide, as maker of the box=
, is to have someone, who knows nothing of electronics, and technology comp=
letely ignore everything I say about the box, and presume to tell me how it=
 really works, how it should be used, and what is acceptable from it. This =
guy is so honest, he won't even use his real name, but huff and puff at at =
anyone that contradicts his use of my equipment. I say, as "a Tester" if yo=
u can't use it in an honest manor, bring the stuff back--testing over! Like=
 it or not, the public has this technology, you can keep pissing and moanin=
g, trying to spread fear, or you could choose the way of Light.   Frank-S
