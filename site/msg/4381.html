<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi

Before I listened to your files, I went back and read the description 
of your configuration so I would understand a bit more. 
I then listened to some of your files and they are interesting.  A 
very different sound--aren&#x27;t they?
The voices are very fast and soft even for EVP samples.  I&#x27;m laughing 
from empathy picturing you straining to hear them!  God bless you!  
I&#x27;d like to hear more of your samples as you get them.  Very 
intriguing answers and quite abundant, from what it looks like.

Keep up the great work,
Ursula

&gt;        OK, so maybe I went over the top yesterday describing my 
laptop 
&gt; setup and how I use it  sorry.  I did post a bunch of EVPs 
&gt; under &quot;Laptop EVPs&quot; in the files.  What I didn&#x27;t make clear is that 
I&#x27;d 
&gt; really appreciate some comments/critiques/suggestions on what I&#x27;ve 
&gt; done.  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of stuff and would really like to run it 
by 
&gt; someone else.  I asked my wife, and she got a blank look, blinked 
&gt; twice, turned and walked away.  My teenage son listened to one clip 
&gt; twice, heard what I did, then had more important stuff to do.  So, 
it 
&gt; would be nice to get some feedback on what I&#x27;ve done so far.
&gt;    I&#x27;ve read that &quot;lower entities&quot; come across more on EVPmaker, 
but so 
&gt; far I haven&#x27;t had any rude experiences  yet.  Two days ago I 
forgot to 
&gt; start the sessions with protection prayer/rules of engagement, and 
&gt; right away a Scottish voice said, &quot;Aye, it smells in here.&quot;  I&#x27;ve 
got 
&gt; another folder worth of stuff to upload, but want to get some 
comments 
&gt; about my previous files first..
&gt;  I&#x27;ve noticed two Bills here already, so to avoid confusion, I&#x27;ll 
go by 
&gt; Willy.
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Willy
