Hey Ron L.,
 
In my experience it does not matter what language you reciev=
e the signal in.
The entities are using only fragments, small bits and piec=
es of the radio signal
to form the words. Therefore it does not matter if t=
he radio signal is in spanish 
or english or any other language for that ma=
tter.
 
Our friends on the other side will manipulate the fragments they ne=
ed to communicate 
with you in the language you will understand.
 
Ron you =
mention that you are using an rs 690 that is not one of the hack model numb=
ers 
maybe you have gotten the wrong radio model. Check the part number it =
must be a 12-469
or a 12-470 and if it is the 470 it would have to be the o=
lder model or it could not be modified.
 
Can you verify that you have modi=
fied the rs radio and that it is continually scanning without
stopping on a=
ny one particular station?
 
Also there would be no need for EVP maker or a=
 microphone to be used during a session with the RS box
all you would need =
is the RS box and a digital recorder, if you have the 469 you would need sp=
eakers to 
record the session or plug the digital recorder directly into th=
e radio.
 
Please check your equipment and how it is operating and let me k=
now so I can help you further.
Don't worry they are just waiting for you to=
 set up the correct equipment and they will communicate.

Bruce, I now have done a few days testing with my rs 690, evp make=

.  Maybe because I only get to scan past 5 to 8 channels on Am or FM so I d=

 help from someone on the other-side.  Maybe they can't find me in Mexico? =
