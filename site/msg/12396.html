&gt; Last night on Haunted Times Magazine radio , guest Brian Harnois (Ghost
&gt; Hunters International) told the radio listening audience that he didn&#x27;t
&gt; think anyone should use a Franks&#x27; Box, (or a ghost box is what he was
&gt; insinuating) unless they had training from Christopher Moon.


*LOL*.  Frank - you&#x27;re not qualified to use your box, better go get
training from Chris.  Better yet, we should change the name of this
group to Haunted Times EVP-ITC (tm).

My question is, who certified the certifier?  Maybe we should start
our own certification club and state anyone who&#x27;s not training from us
is not certified.  I&#x27;m sure some of you could use the money a lot
more?  That way we can all be certified.  Or would that makes us
certifiable? ;)
