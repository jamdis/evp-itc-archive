<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just another editing program i never used.  The uploads stay on that site for 6 months for free, but are taken off if nobody downloads it.  I&#x27;ll see if i can upload it again, so you can check it out.

&gt; What was the Wavosaur Audio editing program you had on your web site as a download but has been taken off? I have never seen that program before.
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve always used Cool Edit Pro, i never had a problem with it.  It accepts all file types and is easy to use.  I have a bunch of these programs that i have uploaded on my site, you should find everything you need there.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry thought of another ?..
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; What free programs do you all use to clean up your Evp&#x27;s etc? It was suggested we do that but I have no clue where to look or what to look for!
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you!
