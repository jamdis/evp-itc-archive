<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Strangely enough I have, but it was many years ago. I was a teenager
when it happened. I was at my grandmothers house when I saw a soft
green like glow illuminating one of the rooms in the hall in the
middle of the night. It was a very soft glow but enough to catch my
attention. I thought someone had left on a TV or that something was
flashing in the room like a clock radio but as I went to investigate
the room the light stopped glowing and I never saw it again.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I am Andrea Carr who is a 41 year old wife and mom of 1 daughter. I
am sorry I have not written before but I have a terrible year and
haven&#x27;t had the time to concentrate on EVP like I had prior. I won&#x27;t
get into the details but it has left me in the midst of OK just trying
to pull through all of this BS &amp; I will get back to it when I can.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunatley I am leaving for the weekend tomorrow morning and
won&#x27;t see my e-mails until Monday morning. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have a question for any one here. I believe in aliens, spirit and
ghost communications via evp but tonight I had an experience I never
had before.
&gt; 
&gt; I woke up at exactly 2:22 by my stove&#x27;s clock and went and cleaned
my sink of dishes while I heated up some cream chipped beef (albiet
not too exciting) but while I sat there after in the dark with my
family sleeping my hallway ilummating a light clored blue several
times. Anyone else ever seen this?
&gt; 
&gt; I look forward to any responses.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Andrea
