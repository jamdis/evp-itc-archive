I&#39;ll try hooking my speakers up instead of using my\nheadset and see if I can hear it louder.\n&gt; keep posting them!

Frank is there anyway you can\nturn up the volume of the box?  Maybe it&#39;s my headphones but it\ndoesn&#39;t seem very loud on the videos?  I love it, thanks so much for\nsharing :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Hi all;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Okay, finally got a video converter to work, so up loaded longer\nvideos to you tube. There should be three from today. I&#39;m not usre if\nthe largest one went through, it&#39;s only 6 minutes though. then another\nis aobut a minute, and the next about 20 seconds. I had to do\nmultiples cuz the random mode wouldn&#39;t work for the first run. the\npurpose of the videos are to show the world waht the box is supposed\nto soudn like. I ask them to say my name, and they may have said\nFrank, but I could hear them say Princess a couple times. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Boo!
