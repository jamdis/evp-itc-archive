<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>if you really want a Degree there are a few Universities that will accommodate you.

here&#x27;s a short list.


Universities with courses in paranormal studies and parapsychology degrees

      UK

    * Edinburgh - The University of Edinburgh is among the most highly respected in the field of parapsychology, and has awarded parapsychology degrees. Their Koestler Parapsychology Unit hosts considerable psi-related research.


    * Hertfordshire - Professor Richard Weisman researches luck and paranormal-related phenomena at the University of Hertfordshire.


      USA

    * Arizona - The Center for Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona offers many courses that focus on issues related to alternative and paranormal studies. These include web-based courses as well as on-campus resources.


    * New Jersey - Princeton University takes a slightly different approach with Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR), with a focus on the &quot;Scientific Study of Consciousness-Related Physical Phenomena&quot; including paranormal studies and remote perception.


    * North Carolina - Duke University&#x27;s Rhine Research Center is &quot;an Institute for the Study of Consciousness,&quot; and offers many psi-related courses, workshops, and seminars.


      JAPAN

    * The International Society of Life Information Science (ISLIS) offers academic symposia and parapsychology research opportunities.


      NETHERLANDS

    * Amsterdam - The Psychology department at the University of Amsterdam has offered courses in paranormal studies. In July 2006, parapsychology courses were not featured at their website, which is in Dutch. With further research, you may find their courses, or they may feature them later. (Also see the nearby University of Utrecht courses, below.)


    * Utrecht - Professor Dick J. Bierman at the University of Utrecht (UU) offers an Internet-based introduction to parapsychology. The University (on-campus) also offers courses in related fields.
