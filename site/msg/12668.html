<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello Kurt,

The diode method is used to eliminate any voice in the area where you 
are recording your session while having the ability to receive EVP.
The germ. diode is connected to the microphone input of a recorder 
instead of the mic.
Some say it acts as a wideband radio frequency detector, but others 
swear by this method.
Konstantin Raudive used this diode method in combination with the 
microphone method so he could mix the two (voice audio with whatever 
the diode picked up).

He even used the diode method in a completely shielded room under 
controlled conditions, and still have voices imprinted on his tapes.

The book I am now reading, &quot;Voices From The Tapes&quot; is about his work 
and the book he wrote which was translated to English in the 1970&#x27;s.

I too will be experimenting more with the diode method in the near 
future as well as building some additional combination devices such as 
are similar to the Psychofon.

I hope you will share your findings with us...
Thanks!
