As an author, I am attacked all the time for &quot;exploiting&quot; \nChicago&#39;s haunted history and those who have had personal experiences \nwith the paranormal phenomena at the sites about which I write.  But I \nhave found that it is only one&#39;s jealous colleagues (or wanna-bes) who \ncomplain. Those who are honestly interested in the phenomena and in \nlearning about its meaning in their lives are grateful for what you do.\nI am such a shy person, and I loathe the natural attention that comes \nfrom what I do.  But you have a duty as a researcher to bring your \nfindings to those who are interested in them.  When you do, the jealous \nand the skeptical will attack you, make no bones about it, and \n(ironically) they will say first off that you are arrogant and self-\nserving, and that you love the limelight.  Some people who love \nattention thrive on that negative attention; for me it&#39;s torture.  But \nI have to deal with it, and so do you!\n\nI would like very much to have you publicly talk about your research.  \nWhat good is it if it doesn&#39;t help idiots like us figure out how to do \nour own?:)"}
