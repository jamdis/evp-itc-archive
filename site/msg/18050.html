I think it does matter though. 

One of the things we're trying to do is se=
t up an objective framework for experimenting with some of these aspects.=
=C2=A0 I think we have all experienced the difficulty in hearing what is on=
 some of these recordings: sometimes we're not sure at first what it says. =
Sometimes we ask others for their input.=C2=A0 Sometimes we only hear it on=
ce someone else tells us it first.=C2=A0 Sometimes we hear it wrong.=C2=A0 =
Sometimes we hear it right. And so on.

It would be useful to know, as an i=
ndividual, how good we are at hearing it right, so we have some idea how tr=
ustworthy our skill, or methods, or technology, is.=C2=A0 If we can measure=
 that, or even get a feel for it, we can look for ways to improve it.=C2=A0=
 If we can't measure it, then we could be stuck.=C2=A0 

So, by restricting=
 the answers only to the timeframe of the experiment, we can help filter ou=
t some of the problems of subjectivity: for example, one theory is that peo=
ple can hear what they want to hear, or can these sounds in a certain way, =
once you already know the answer.=C2=A0 Or, given 2 ways to hear a sound, b=
eing influenced, even subconsciously, to hear it one way over the other.=C2=
=A0 We want to rule that out.

This is one reason we can only count on answ=
ers given during the timeframe.=C2=A0 That is when the answer is most objec=
tive.=C2=A0 Once the object has been announced, we move into a=C2=A0 period=
 where we can't discount possible influence from already knowing the answer=
.

But, I am confident that if a person's method or technology really can r=
eveal the correct answer outside the timeframe, then doing it within the ti=
meframe should be just as easy, and would then be a valid objective result =
for all to see.

Thanks again for everyone who participated! I

     understanding of EVP-ITC.

If you recall, on 
                      7/=
10/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer 
                      mon=
itor, right in front of me, and left it there until 
                      =
today, 7/14/2010, noon Denver time. The experiment was for 
               =
       participants to determine what it was. Vague or partial 
           =
           answers wouldn't be counted (for example, just colors, 
        =
              shapes, sizes, what it's made of, etc): we're looking for 
  =
                    what it is. Participants could use their ghost boxes, E=
VP 
                      recorders, or I suppose any other means they 
   =
                   chose.

In order to keep me honest, I took a picture 
  =
                    of the object at the start of the experiment and loaded=
 it 
                      to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group. =
If you can 
                      follow the link, it is here:

http://tech=
. groups.yahoo. 
                      com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.2010=
0710. 
                      1.zip

The idea was that you could download th=
e 
                      file at the beginning of the test, and 'keep it sa=
fe' on 
                      your computer. Then at the end of the test, I=
 would 
                      release the password so you could reveal the =
contents of 
                      the file. That way, you were in control =
of the original 
                      image during the entire test, not me=
. 

The password 
                      for that file is: 123BlastOff
Instr=
uctions, if you need 
                      them, are also in that RJ folde=
r.

And if you did 
                      not care to download the zip file=
 before the test, I will 
                      post the final image there =
too.

So to the 
                      results:

Number of participants: 5
=
Total tries: 
                      8
Ambiguous answers: 0
Correct answers:=
 
                      0

Object: A radio
Uzipped picture:
http://tech. gr=
oups.yahoo. 
                      com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710=
. 
                      1.JPG

So what do the results mean? All that we 
 =
                     can really agree on from this experiment is that no 
 =
                     participant, with whatever theories or methods or 
   =
                   technology they used, was able to correctly determine th=
e 
                      object. We can't say those theories or methods or =

                      technologies never work. Just as we can't say they d=
o. 
                      Just that, for whatever reason, they did not work=
 this 
                      time. Readers can take the results, use them t=
o improve or 
                      change their methods, or keep doing wha=
t they're 
                      doing.

If anyone has any observations, co=
mments, or 
                      ideas for improvement, let me know. I hop=
e to get a new 
                      experiment up and running soon. Since=
 there wasn't much 
                      participation Mon-Wed, I think th=
e next experiment will be 
                      arranged to mostly span th=
e weekends.

Again, thanks 
                      to everyone who participa=

                      experiment.
