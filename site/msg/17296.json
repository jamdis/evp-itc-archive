Hope we get some good communication during this time.  Interesting about how all this affects our moods and bodies.  \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mllejade&quot; &lt;leongbabe@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On May 27th or May 28th, the CME, Solar Flare is expected to hit Earth in a glancing blow. It could spark geomagnetic storms and will most likely affect cell phones, radios, and the bioelectric fields around the human body creating an energetic shift which will be felt differently depending on ones energetic signature. Some will be agitated some will feel very lethargic and many go up and down between the two.\n&gt; \n&gt; Additionally, the moon is waxing, at its fullest at 4:07 pm PDT today, May 27, but expect its effects to last for at least 24 hours after its peak.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://spaceweather.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; Sharon from SF\n&gt;"}
