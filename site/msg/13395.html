<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree, Kay.  My DVR is set.  There have the snake oil types, or
rotten apples in the barrel, in most every field of work/research for
eons.  All we can hope for is minimal damage and maximum benefit.

For example, I didn&#x27;t care, at all, for the negative slant the movie
White Noise put on ITC.  But it did raise awareness of the subject and
the DVD had great bonus features on it showing people how to record
for EVP.  Overall, I&#x27;d like to think it was a plus for the field.

&gt; Regardless of the negative reactions that have been posted about
Moon I am going to watch the show. If anything comes out ofChris
Moonbeing on the show and using the franks box I hope it will draw
people who are interested in this kind of research to the right people
just as it has for me.

&gt; &gt; Has anyone heard about this new show? Looks like Chris Moon will be 
&gt; &gt; starring in the up coming show that airs Feb 13. Might be worth 
&gt; &gt; watching.
