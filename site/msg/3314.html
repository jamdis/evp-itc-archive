<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m not making this out to be anything more than it is. I would like to get
the information out, just as Frank would, but some people, myself included,
are not comfortable with public exposure, and particularly a &#x27;live
interview&#x27; environment. For that reason I have others who are willing to
speak about my version of the Box. They were there during the development,
they are seasoned researchers, and they are objective. There are no better
people than those to &#x27;get the word out&#x27;.

Also, I worked in the print media for ten years so thoroughly understand all
aspects of publication, promotion and interviewing. For that reason I have
chosen to have my associates take care of the public aspects of the
information distribution. Moreover, I am much more comfortable expressing
myself in print, and will be writing some articles in the near future. In
the meantime, I am still developing and testing the MiniBox, as well as some
other devices, and will make information available to all when they are
completed and working properly.

The media is a vital factor of any new scientific development. It is
important to distribute and share the knowledge that has been gained, and to
keep everyone informed about all the events surrounding these developments.
Without the mainstream media, this information would be closeted and
unavailable to others. I want to insure that all relevant developments in my
work are fully and accurately described, and that the information comes from
those with firsthand knowledge of the events. My colleagues are fully
qualified to discuss this publicly and have my full confidence. They were
there.

I believe this should settle this before it gets blown out of proportion.

Just because a researcher talks about the box research on a radio show 
doesnt make them any less a researcher, the Box is already out there 
in the paranormal world, dont you think it best that the information 
given to the media should come from professional researchers, getting 
the facts out there is surely more important.  Dont forget most of 
theses paranormal radio shows are there because of their love of 
paranormal research and investigating, you really come across as a kid 
with a new toy that dont want anyone else to play with, this research 
is no longer part of a secret club the water is already over the rim 
of the glass, let people know the facts before some fly by night gets 
taken for his word... Rant over!!
