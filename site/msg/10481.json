I haven&#39;t yet had time to try using the hack setup, my life has been,\nshall we say, very intensive and busy of late.\n\nI have been involved with psychic work for most of my life, and have\nchanneled one specific guide since 1971, so contact with &quot;the other side&quot; is\na part of my normal, everyday life. I don&#39;t do this professionally, I am a\ncorporate/business consultant, and do some TV stuff in that domain, but\nhaven&#39;t been in the public eye for psychic-related things since the mid-1970&#39;s.\n\nTo me, there has never been any doubt in my mind whatsoever that we live on\nbeyond our physical bodies, it&#39;s been proven to me countless times in my own\nexperience. The value of the boxes and hacks are to capture the actual\nvoices as a record, which I think is VERY cool... but to me, it&#39;s not about\nproving the existence of the non-visible world; to me that&#39;s a given. \n\nMy Mom passed away after a long illness this past January, and though I miss\nher terribly (I was her main caregiver for years) and am sorry she is not\nhere, incarnate any longer, I know she was joyful to leave her badly ailing\nbody, and to move on to a happier new life. I happened to be at a meeting\nwith a really good medium a couple of weeks later, and my Mom came through\nright away, insistently (just like her in mortal life! &lt;g&gt;), and was just\nhilarious. She mentioned a couple of very specific details that only I would\nknow, and I got great comfort that she came through someone else so I knew\nit wasn&#39;t my own wishful thinking that she&#39;d stay in a little contact.\n\nShe has since moved on for now, I know she needs that and she is joyful to\nbe in her new experience, so I am content not to bother her for now... but\nit would have been way cool to have had those messages, so clearly from her,\nin her own voice and not the voice of the medium. That&#39;s why I think all the\nresearch here is so important and vital, so please keep it up! &lt;g&gt;\n\nHere&#39;s my take on the issue of protection when contacting discarnate beings:\n\nBeings on the other side aren&#39;t much different from we folks who currently\nreside in physical bodies. We all, carnate and discarnate, have our\npersonalities and quirks, some of us are more evolved, kinder beings, and\nsome of us just aren&#39;t so nice, or are caught in our narrowly focused\nmaterial-world oriented egos. Simply put: there are as many good and mean\nentities on the other side as there are people in our five-senses world, not\nmuch difference.\n\nWe all need to use our simple common sense in this world and the other; if\nsomeone is treating you with respect, kindly, or at least dispassionately,\nwhy not keep the contact going? If they are trashing you, trying to scare\nyou, manipulate you, etc... why bother continuing with them? If you got a\ncrank call on your telephone, I&#39;d hope you&#39;d just hang up! \n\nSame with entities... I expect them to treat me well, and I will treat them\nwell. If they get out of line, I&#39;m outta there, I&#39;m not going to put up with\nany nonsense just because they happen not to be in a physical body at the time.\n\nI don&#39;t believe any entity can harm me in any way; it is only my own fear or\nthrill of being in contact with the dark forces that can harm me, if I go\nthere. Just as with other people, any harm done depends very much on how I\nreact to them in addition to how they are treating me.\n\nSo: I recommend having very good boundaries and not letting the fact that\nyou are in contact with discarnate beings sway you into thinking you need to\nbe any more deferential or afraid than you would be with a person standing\nright in front of you. Remember the golden rule, do unto others as you would\nhave others do unto you, and don&#39;t go there with the crank calls... just\ntell them you&#39;re not interested, and not to contact you again because you\nwill break the contact if they keep misbehaving. If they keep it up, you\nknow where the &quot;off&quot; button is... use it!\n\nAs an aside, I also don&#39;t think we&#39;re here to provide interdimensional\npsychotherapy to troubled spirits; of course offer help and comfort if you\ncan if they ask for it or need it, but don&#39;t get hooked. &lt;ggg&gt;\n\nOk, I&#39;ll get off my soapbox now, sorry if I was long-winded, but I wanted to\ncontribute some support and comfort to those here who are so busily doing\nsuch great research.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nLeslie\n\n&quot;A friend hears the song in my heart and sings it to me when my memory fails.&quot;\n\n\t-- Unknown\n\n&quot;Remember always that you have not only the right to be an individual; you\nhave an obligation to be one.
