I think I been on there before but i don&#39;t remember the step-by step for the 587.\n\nI had the 470 model ordered from my local radioshack.  They said it was their last one in inventory in the entire district.  That was on June10th.  I called today (july 10th) and the salesman said it was the black one with the green circle like the 469.  I have seen it as low as $9.99 marked as clearance/discontinued.  Have you tried hacking that one yet?\n\nI like the idea of the built in speaker like the older 470 (white and grey one) and the most recent one you hacked has a built in speaker too!\n\nThanks again."}
