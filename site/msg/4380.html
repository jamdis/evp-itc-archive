<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>OK, so maybe I went over the top yesterday describing my laptop 
setup and how I use it  sorry.  I did post a bunch of EVPs 
under &quot;Laptop EVPs&quot; in the files.  What I didn&#x27;t make clear is that I&#x27;d 
really appreciate some comments/critiques/suggestions on what I&#x27;ve 
done.  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of stuff and would really like to run it by 
someone else.  I asked my wife, and she got a blank look, blinked 
twice, turned and walked away.  My teenage son listened to one clip 
twice, heard what I did, then had more important stuff to do.  So, it 
would be nice to get some feedback on what I&#x27;ve done so far.
   I&#x27;ve read that &quot;lower entities&quot; come across more on EVPmaker, but so 
far I haven&#x27;t had any rude experiences  yet.  Two days ago I forgot to 
start the sessions with protection prayer/rules of engagement, and 
right away a Scottish voice said, &quot;Aye, it smells in here.&quot;  I&#x27;ve got 
another folder worth of stuff to upload, but want to get some comments 
about my previous files first..
 I&#x27;ve noticed two Bills here already, so to avoid confusion, I&#x27;ll go by 
Willy.
Thanks
Willy</pre>
