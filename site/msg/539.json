Its a method that only recently started working even tho they had me trying it for months with no results... so I dont use it often. \n   \n  They were bugging me to contact Sonia Rinaldi again, but I still have no clue how to do that. At least this time I know shes a real person LOL. They want us to share methods/contacts. I been gettin those messages for like almost a year now and I havent bumped into her yet so I can only assume maybe the opportunity will present itself in the future. Until then I just post the info how I do stuff for anyone.\n   \n  I am not even sure she speaks english and they were speaking another language after they say her name and I cant understand it at all.
