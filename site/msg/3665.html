<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s sure nice to be recognized for a job well done!

LMAO!

Actually, I&#x27;m motivated to assist all of us by being a voice of calm, 
reason, and compassion among a stormy sea.

Granted, there are some serious issues that are going on, sides being 
drawn, ect... Yet, does anyone really think this effort at 
communication is best served by allowing it to become just another 
battle ground?  

Peace,
Lance

energy to the group, especially &gt; when I have been preaching harmony
