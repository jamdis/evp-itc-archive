I don&#39;t know what\nlanguage it is. You can hear my dog in the background panting and shaking.\nHe has tags on his collar that rattle when he shakes. You can also hear\nbirds outside where I had my window open, but that&#39;s not until near the end.\n\nHere&#39;s what I think I can hear so far. Comments are welcome!\n\n:02 Yeah, Bob&#39;s in here (my father-in-law and brother-in-law, both deceased,\nare named Bob)\n:11 It&#39;s on the topic\n:25 Ghost box (this is a spoken EVP, not in the original recording)\n:42 It&#39;s a secret from ...
