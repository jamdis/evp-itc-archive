<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Here is my writing on &quot;Random Fields&quot; that can enhance paranormal events&gt;


What is a &quot;Random Field&quot;

A &quot;Random Field&quot; is what I call any sort of &quot;sensory background&quot;, be it a viewing screen or sound environment, etc. that contains random data (visual or auditory) that can be used to aid the brain to perceive corresponding sensory data from the subconscious mind.

Examples of Random Fields The &quot;Random Field&quot; in paranormal research

One example of a random field may be a  simple viewing screen made up of paper or cloth that contains a random scatter of  small &quot;dots&quot; on it.  Such a screen can be made by simply shining a low wattage light bulb or candle BEHIND the paper which is mounted in a vertical frame or folded to stand upright.  The texture of the paper fibers, seen through the side opposite  the light,  tend to make one of the most effective random patterns.

Another random field is an &quot;auditory&quot; one, which is simply a place where  one can hear &quot;white noise&quot;.  Historically, ancient  &quot;Oracles&quot; were known to use the wind blowing through trees and waterfalls, for a &quot;white noise&quot; source.

How do random fields work ?

Using the visual random field as an example, it has its origins in the &quot;Crystal Balls&quot;, &quot;Mystical ink bowls&quot; and blank, white walls often used by mystics and &quot;fortune tellers&quot; to see imagery from the subconscious mind.  The modern version of these devices is called the &quot;GANZFELD&quot; a German word for &quot;blank field&quot; used in psychic research.  Ganzfelds often consist of blank white surfaces or walls, ping pong ball halves placed over the eyes or goggles with frosted white lenses.
      A person using such a device, in a quiet environment will often see images, from his subconscious mind apparently &quot;projected&quot; on the white surface.  It is said to be due to what is called the &quot;retinal feedback&quot; theory.  The subconscious mind is always active, and sends imagery, albeit very faint, back DOWN the optic nerves to the eyes.  Normal vision tends to overwhelm these feedback images, so we usually do not see them.  But if a sufficiently blank viewing surface, of the correct brightness is presented before our eyes, these images, often quite detailed, can become directly visible.

This is said to be the same principle that makes the Crystal Ball and other such devices provide the users with images that has often been historically associated with &quot;visions of the future&quot;, clairvoyance, etc.   Ganzfelds and Crystal Balls are limited, however in that only about 10% of the users can see images with them.  With the Random Field, on the other hand, experience has shown that about 90% of people can get imagery.

In a visual random field one first sees a random scatter of light and dark spots on a screen (stage one).  After a while, the brain starts to subconsciously, and precociously play &quot;connect the dots&quot; (stage two) and make &quot;pictures&quot; and &quot;faces&quot;, etc.  this making pictures out of random forms is called  &quot;pareidolia&quot; a natural tendency of the brain to create a kind or order out of &quot;chaos&quot;(the random dots). The next thing that happens is that a white &quot;mist&quot; tends to form in the visual field,  suddenly very clear, almost photographic images begin to form,(stage three) some obscuring the entire screen area. The &quot;slide show&quot; has begun.  One after the other, every few seconds or so, one image will fade out and another will fade in.  These images are highly detailed and have no relation to the patterns on the viewing surface.  First time experiencers are quite astounded at the effect .  No wonder the ancients read so much into their significance.  After a minute or two, the slide show slows down and stops, and the user reverts to the pareidolia stage once again.  At which time it is time to end the session.
Pareidolia is often used most, by the uninformed, to describe the mechanics of the entire experience , but it  breaks down as an explanation for stage 3. 

What appears to be happening is that the subconscious image , like the viewing screen, has light and dark areas that make it up.  To see the images the, visual system suppresses or enhances light and dark spots on the screen that do not correspond to those of the image.  Areas of the viewing screen that DO correspond to the light dark areas of the image are not affected.  The result is that less &quot;effort&quot; is needed to see a subconscious image than would be needed to generate an entire image, as in the Gansfeld or Crystal Ball.  This &quot;effort&quot;, or lack of it can make all the difference , in most people, as to whether they see any imagery at allor not.   This appears to explain why so few people can see imagery on gansfeld devices while so many can use the random field successfully.

What do the images mean?

SO what are these images?  Are they visions of the future?  Are they spirits or some other kind of psychic event?  Most scientists can agree that these images are from the &quot;subconscious mind&quot;----Just as dreams and other &quot;visions&quot; are.   But many researchers conclude also that the latent &quot;psychic&quot; ability that everyone has ALSO resides in the subconscious mind, where we &quot;non-Psychics&quot; cannot get at it.   The fact that both systems are in the same place in the mind makes it perfectly reasonable that many of these images CAN be of a psychic nature and have real significance.  This writer has seen images LATER on TV and elsewhere that he first had seen on the viewer.

Building and using a random field viewer

A simple way to build a random field viewer is to take a piece of white typing paper and fold it like an &quot;L&quot; so it will stand up.  Place a smooth cylindrical glass or jar of water on the lap of the L to hold it in place and to lean the top of the paper against.  We will look at the paper THROUGH the water container (this gives the field a bit of &quot;dynamics&quot; and enhances the effect)  Place a small wattage light BEHIND the paper/water glass set up so that light shines through the paper and you see the dot pattern through the glass.  The room should be dark or dimly lit and the screen should be viewed from about 6 to 8 feet away. 
Look through the water and onto the paper. (no need to stare) The first time might take 10 to 20 minutes.  It&#x27;s all in the way you use your eyes.  Holding one&#x27;s head down and rolling one&#x27;s eyes upwards to see the glass also seems to help.  You will have to figure out how to use your eyes on your own---You will progress to stage two, making images by connect the dots, and start to see &quot;mists&quot; once you discover the &quot;eye trick&quot; the slide show will begin---The images will look like photographs, usually, black and white with sorta low contrast, but you will see details like signs, and lines on the road, etc.---Some people see COLOR images.  When the slide show is over, its time to stop.

The next session you will be able to se images MUCH sooner.  Practice makes perfect.  Stop after 20 minutes if nothing happens.

Connections with EVP

There are some definite connections with EVP.  But there one is using an AUDITORY field.  I would think that the same 3 stages would apply.  Also there will be a pareidolia stage, but what happens beyond that might have some mediumistic implications.

OBJECTIVE Random fields.

Of course the information gathered above is subjective---made in one&#x27;s mind system and cannot be recorded or photographed to be seen by others.  Objective use of the random field can be used in GHOST photosand perhaps even ghost video.  Just like the  random viewing field  helping the subconscious mind image to be made visible with less effort, the ghost seems to be able to take advantage of the same effect to make itself visible against a random background.---Look at the best ghost images.  Often a brick wall or a line of shrubs is in the background---even part of the background is incorporated into the ghost image.  The ghost has only to cover parts of the background that do NOT correspond to his image to be seen---reducing the energy needed for an apparition.  I have done experiments with random backgrounds and have got some good ghost images.

For EVP  the same principle may apply.  The ghost need only suppress those frequencies of background noise that do not correspond to what he wants to say. Here the sound will be REAL and recordable---for others to hear.</pre>
