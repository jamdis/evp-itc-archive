Hi!

I'm new to the group. I was doing ITC looped through the TV until my c=
amcorder broke. Now I am saving for a new one. Digital this time! Anyway, I=
 thought the pictures were just wonderful and I would be excited about them=
 too!! I am also curious what you are doing to get such clear photos. I hav=
e gotten "scenes", faces, silhouettes, etc. Nothing that clear.

I have als=
o used running water too for ITC with good results. 

I am very curious abo=
ut how you are set up!

Heather





  I have to agree with you on this one=
.  That is pretty impressive.  What configuration are you using.  I have do=
ne some video work using the continuous loop idea of recording the televisi=
on screen showing the same television screen that I was recording, if that =
makes any sense.

     It's a bit frustrating to be excited all to hell about somet=
hing and nobody cares!
