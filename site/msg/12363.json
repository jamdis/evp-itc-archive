Its a really simple mod for anyone that has basic\nsoldering experience.\n\nPics of the finished mod are in my folder &quot;Marty&#39;s goldBox&quot; - \n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Marty%27s%20goldBox/\n\nBrief directions on how to attach the switch -\n\n1) Cut the protective tape off around the up scan contact (or down\nscan if you want to use that) using an x-acto knife.\n\n2) Remove the contact bubble switch.\n\n3) Prime the middle contact circle and a spot on the outer contact\ncircle with a small blob of solder, and of course prime your wires.\n\n4) Gently heat the wire as you place it to the solder point on the\ninner or outer circle (whichever one you want to start with) - i.e.\nthe wire should gently sink in to the now heating solder blob.  Let\ncool, and add more solder to it if the connection feels too flimsy,\nbeing very careful not to let any solder accidentally connect the two\nsolder points.  Another words, care must be taken not to accidentally\nsolder the outer and inner circles together.\n\n\nThis mod cuts out the problem of random stalls in the auto-scanning of\nthe tuner I was talking about.  Just flip the switch, and it scans\ncontinuously. \n\nI&#39;ll be doing the same switch mod with the power on button as well, as\nI want to mount this all in a case that I&#39;ll be adding to a special\nbox I&#39;m putting together as well (the entire thing being called a\ngoldBox when it&#39;s finished).  I&#39;ll be documenting all of that here,\nand continuing to put pics up of the entire design and creation\nprocess in my folder then.\n\n\nMarty"}
