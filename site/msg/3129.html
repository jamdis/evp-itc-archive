Yeah that 1mb is a load of crap LOL
   
  It is: file attachments must be under 500kb and when uploaded it increases the size for some reason yet allows it to go thru as long as originally on your drive they are under 500kb
   
  Not the greatest system, theres tons of stuff I would like to share sometimes but just doesnt allow it. Thats why I started an esnips account so I can share the bigger things.
