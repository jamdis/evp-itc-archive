I was\n&gt; basically called a liar and this clears up that misconception. If I am\n&gt; banned from this group for telling the truth, than so be it.\n\nNo one called you a liar, I don&#39;t think. I believe we said we didn&#39;t\nagree with your verdict that spirit communication harms children, that\nthere are portals from hell, or that negative entities are a real threat.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;...it was not the question of whether the phenomenon existed to begin\n&gt; with, but rather what is the phenomenon.  That will require a good\n&gt; deal more effort to explore and beginning in January we will be\n&gt; undertaking test sessions all over north and east Texas as well as\n&gt; other national locations with a wide variety of folks to see what\n&gt; happens within the group dynamic.  The testing will include folks who\n&gt; are both believers and non-believers, skeptics, critics, other\n&gt; researchers, children, high school students, college and grad\n&gt; students, and senior citizens to name a few categories.&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t mean to parse--well, okay, yes, I do, but if you actually look\nat what is written here, it does not say anywhere that these devices\nwere going to be taken into schools. I believe &quot;high-school students&quot;\nshould be read as an age group--like teens. So, this hysteria about\nevil, untrue miniboxes being foisted on unsuspecting school kids\nintheir classrooms needs to stop. It ain&#39;t happening and never was.\n\n&gt; Are you willing to &quot;see what happens&quot; with our children?\n\nExactly whose children are you so worried about? The ones whose\nparents will almost certainly let them participate? The idea that the\nintent is to do this by stealth is completely unfounded.\n\nI know that I plan to let my kids in on the experiments, if they want\n(they might not give a flip) just as my grandmother (a Spiritualist\nmedium) did for me. I was raised, from birth in an Spiritualist\nenvironment where afterdeath communication was normal. Am I scarred\nfor life? Nope. More like fascinated for life.\n\nThere are lots of kids in the world who are in danger that is a hell\nof a lot more real and pressing than the possibility that someone may\nshow up at their school with a minibox and force them to listen to\ndead people. If you want to be fearful, be fearful, but at least do it\nabout the children who really help.\n\nCan we now close this topic by agreeing to disagree?\n\nAnn"}
