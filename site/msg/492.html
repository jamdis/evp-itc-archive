You Know You're A Ghost Hunter IF... 


Your car has a bumper sticker that reads: I'd Rather Be Ghost hunting! 

You refuse to stay at a hotel that's not haunted. 

You hear someone say "You look like you saw a ghost!"...and you start interviewing them. 

You hang out on a ghost message board more then any other place on the net. 

You talk to a brown out. 

Your coolest ghost photo is framed and hanging in the hallway with your family photos. 

You are more afraid of the living than you are of the dead. 

You're the only one in the photo shop who gets excited over "bad" pictures. 

You sit at your computer and look at the reflections in the screen to see if there is anyone behind you. 

You have more photos of ghosts than you do of family photos. 

99% of your bookmarks on the internet are ghost related. 

You invite friends over to watch home movies and they see your last three investigations. (Film of an empty room for 3 hours.) 

Your kid says they have an imaginary friend... and out come the cameras, tape recorders, camcorders 

You apologize to the ghost for getting scared because you thought it was a human. 

Your friends stop and stare at the Sony Night cam aimed at the bed in the spare bedroom and you have to tell them it isn't what they think it is. 

You sleep with a camera next to your bed,...ya know, just in case 

You find an EMF detector next to the remote for the TV. 

Your newest electronic toy is an motion sensor! 

At an event you film the ceiling and places where there are no people. 

You spend as much time looking at the negatives, as you do the prints. 

You're the only one at Aunt Bessie's funeral with an EMF meter and a tape recorder. 

You're watching scary movies with your family and someone asks "Can ghosts really do that?" and you actually have an answer and the explanation. 

Attending a family reunion is a trip to the family plot 

Your friends tell you not to get involved in this stuff, because you may end up having a ghost possess you! 

You spend more time with dead people than the living...but hey, aren't they more fun? 

You sit at the office all day staring at a mini web cam of some deserted boat's engine room waiting for that "ONE PICTURE" instead of getting any of your work done. 

You have more recordings of EVP?s than you do of your favorite music 

You spend all your free time in haunted buildings and cemeteries, talking to the darkness. 

You've been chased away from the Amityville house after disturbing a family barbeque in the backyard 

UPS now delivers your new equipment to the office rather than your home so you don't have to explain to your wife why you need another ghost detector. 

You have more photography equipment than a Japanese tourist 

You keep rewinding that part on "3 men and a baby" to try to prove that it is a cardboard cut-out of Ted Danson. 

You are waiting for Reggis to ask, "What is the most Haunted Place on Earth?" 

You take a picture of your entire family and ask any deceased relatives to join in the picture 

You get a new camera and the first thing you do is get rid of the strap. 

You refuse to make friends with people who are skeptics
