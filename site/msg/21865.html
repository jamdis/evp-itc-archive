<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Somebody was asking about sweeping a higher frequecny range, seems kinda
pointless, but I was at
Goodwill and found a wireless mic receiver for $2. I think these things
operate in the UHF range, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s sweepable, but I&#x27;ll check it.
Yeah, how do ya know it won&#x27;t work if ya don&#x27;t try it!? (reminding myself).

Sometimes I see scanners at eh GW, and that would work too.

F-S
