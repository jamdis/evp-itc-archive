Wow very cool, I can hear them but a bit different then you. Would you mind=
 elaborating into what your method is?  Your recording directly into the co=
mputer using a stereo?

  Frank This came after I emailed you so perhaps its a notation to add =
to what I said about thier words sometimes get edited or have more meaning =
later on. The message is improved in time. I am still not sure who used to =
be proud of me because I forgot to ask for names and later sessions were no=
t as clear.

  The signals were very strong today here. I did a session usi=
ng the pc fm radio set to the station "they" requested using no antenna hoo=
kup and then ran it thru the filter "they" made me stumble upon...the conve=
rsation was so loud in some parts it kinda freaked me out a little bit at f=
irst LOL 

  I dont usually use that method alot because it never has good =
results unless I mute it while recording even then it only increases thier =
signal a bit louder which I can do using amplify or turn the volume up.

  =
It's stormy here the past few days so perhaps that is a f actor.
