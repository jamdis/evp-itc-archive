<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The one I heard very clearly was &quot;looking back on our plan to establish&quot;   wow.... it&#x27;s definitely an illusion, like something that can be heard both ways perhaps... I keep saying that the audio files are often like that illusion with the dancer that can be seen spinning both ways depending on how you concentrate.... now listening to this it just further confirms it... that would be the reason why native speakers only hear the native tongue... extremely fascinating these files....

&gt; 
&gt;  Tune in a foreign language you don&#x27;t understand, sit the recorder near the
&gt; pseaker, announce you&#x27;re doing an EVP recording, and rtecord a while. the
&gt; messages are mixed in with the broadcast. Curiously, people that speak that
&gt; language won&#x27;t hear anything but the original broadcast. I know--nobody hear
&gt; it.
