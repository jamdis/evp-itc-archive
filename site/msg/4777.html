<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s been my experience that the darkside will harrass when there&#x27;s 
something they don&#x27;t want you to use.

&gt; Yeah, everytime i ask which box i should be using they always say 
&gt; Joe&#x27;s Box.  I believe that box become the portal to hell for me so 
i 
&gt; stay away or at least for now anyway.  Reception is never a problem 
&gt; for me, but not all devices work well everyday.  Frank&#x27;s box #27 is 
&gt; very noisy but always gives me very direct answers to my questions 
&gt; everytime.  All of them have given me great results at some point 
and 
&gt; when newer stuff comes out i will try them too.  Never get stuck on 
&gt; one particular method or box, you have to mix it up all the time to 
&gt; get different responses.  Some days i just feel like doing a manual 
&gt; sweep, it&#x27;s always different.  If i can get the Minibox to give me 
&gt; real time answers than that would be the best because of the 
clarity 
&gt; of the radio.  The minibox is so clear to listen to, but you have 
to 
&gt; go over it with headphones and patience to find out the answers.  
The 
&gt; answers are there though, so maybe i just have to get used to the 
way 
&gt; it works a little better.

&gt; &gt; It funny just how they know what box&#x27;s your using.  I started 
with 
&gt; the 469 first, they told me to switch to the 470 and the reception 
&gt; stunk, so we switch back.  I alway ask them, which reception is 
&gt; better on the otherside.

&gt; &gt; Had a pretty good session today, i&#x27;ve been pretty blocked with 
&gt; other 
&gt; &gt; boxes yet i seem to always get great results with the RS 12-470. 
&gt; Some 
&gt; &gt; really good responses to my questions. Hey babs, i think you 
should 
&gt; &gt; give the RS box a little time and maybe you will start to get 
&gt; stuff. 
&gt; &gt; Although i have a 12-469 also and it really sux compared to the 
12-
&gt; &gt; 470. The constant pulsing noise in the 469 model just drives me 
&gt; crazy 
&gt; &gt; enough to not concentrate. Try looking for an older style model 
of 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; 12-470, that&#x27;s probably the best radio i own hands down. Instant 
&gt; &gt; results always and consistently. All my boxes work, but they are 
&gt; &gt; finicky sometimes. No need to comment to my posted files guys, 
just 
&gt; &gt; listen and see if i&#x27;m on some sort of a right track with the 
&gt; &gt; communication.
