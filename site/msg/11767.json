Check the newspaper\narchives.\n\nCarol B.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; I am going to Gatlinburg, TN. While there I will be doing an\n&gt; investigation at a hotel. I was wondering where would be the best\n&gt; place to research two murders that occurred at the hotle. Should I\n&gt; start at the police department? I have searched the internet, but\n&gt; found no details.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
