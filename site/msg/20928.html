This type of person is called a troll. Joins a group to post silly little o=
ne liners to bother others. Since we all have a life, let it do whatever it=
 does. It needs something to do to entertain itself. It has no intelluctual=
 arguement and doesn't really care about the subject matter of this group! =
It just reposts others words!
