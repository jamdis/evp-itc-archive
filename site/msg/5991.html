They were very clear.
I am envious of your editing skills :).

&gt; Guys, 
&gt;        I just posted several files from a joint session this 
weekend in 
&gt; Kentucky.  I would appreciate the imput from those who are serious 
&gt; about the research here.  Many of the serious researchers have 
spent 
&gt; years, and countless hours a day testing these lines of 
communication.  
&gt; I for one refuse to allow the negitive get to me and will continue 
to 
&gt; work either independently or with my fellow colleages who truly 
respect 
&gt; each other and their contributions in this area.
&gt; 
&gt;         So with that being said, I hope you enjoy the audio clips.  
&gt; They are from a Joe&#x27;s Box session.
&gt; 
&gt;         In addition, I have introduced several new researchers to 
the 
&gt; RS hacked in hopes that their their future studies will add in our 
up 
&gt; hill climb in pursuing what we started.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Juli
