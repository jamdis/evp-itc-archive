I'd also recommend people carefully read the terms of service of these plac=
es before uploading anything.=A0 Some have snuck into those terms language =
which gives them the ownership rights to anything you post: rights which ca=

LOL Snowfire! Nope it was not you this time. Others should read b=
efore they post because we just addressed this subject. Esnips is very easy=
 to use it has two uploading options in case you cant use the java applicat=
ion use the single file uploader. Works alot like email upload attachments.=



If you need more help just holler and I am sure one of us will be more t=
han willing to help you figure it out. Posting from email as an attachment =
also works just not so well for the very large file sizes. There are many o=
ther file sharing storage places besides esnips. We just like the layout th=
ere and the ability to share with friends including sharing storage space.
