Or otherwise leave you alone?  I&#39;m wondering if he/she/it is hogging the spotlight and not letting anyone else through.  That time I was getting bullshit answers from &quot;Steve,&quot; and my Uncle Red came through, I swear I heard someone say, &quot;Get away from me&quot; -- as if Red was trying to talk, and Steve was getting in the way somehow.  Just a thought:  maybe your guys are keeping more desirable contact with benevolent entities at bay.  (Like I know anything, I&#39;m a newbie! Feel free to ignore my posts!  But I just feel so bad for you, that you keep getting all this doomsday stuff.)\n\nJill\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Went on one of the ghost hunts on the Queen may, but I don&#39;t get anything\n&gt; related to tat stuff, I get this stuff--everywhere.
