Mike,
 
In all my sessions I try to ask at least two or three tech questions about the advancement of the equipment or any instructions or advice they have
on furthering the research. I have even dedicated whole sessions to only technical and research questions, and have done whole sessions
for scientist's that where trying to develop new technology. And those consisted of detailed tech questions concerning frequencies and tone and wave settings
and or levels.
 
In all those sessions and 100's more regular sessions that contained various research advancement questions. I have only received mostly vague answers
and a couple of full precise answers of a purely technical nature, but no follow up answers or communication to build on those answers.
 
You have to remember that the equipment we have been using is not really capable of spirits being able to send detailed lengthy communication
that would be necessary to explain any technical advancement instructions or research answers. Our boxes up to this point have allowed mostly 
two to three word communication at a time and on rare occasions a sentence or phase consisting of more than 5 words.
 
I have not yet ventured these tech or research questions with EVP maker or sound soap.
But I am starting to be convinced that this is our first and best hope for solid length full communication capable of
answering detailed questions or giving detailed instruction.
 
Also I believe that our friends are holding back information, like a parent using flash cards with a child. If the child hits a snag the parent will assist with small hints until
the child reaches the correct answer, but never answers for the child. This in turn assures complete understanding by the child of the problem and solution and
also serves to teach reasoning and problem solving skills.
 
I think they will help, but would like us to use their "Hints" to help ourselves.
 
I will try to get answers to some of these questions using the "Allophone method" during my upcoming sessions.
 
Bruce

One last comment on this topic.
 
I without a doubt do not believe any one of us on this member site would resort to adding messages between the question and answer recording to make it legible. That is not what we do, nor how we think.
 
But it is the debunkers out there, and the media, and the skeptics that would jump on any evidence of that nature, and further stain our research as some debunkers already have.
 
Some day we are all gonna discover a tool that will not require any edits, and that is what we all seek. I look forward to that day when we can all toast to that success!
 
In your research, let's start to ask the spirit friends what tool on earth would work better, a tool we have yet to test. Let's ask them how they get their voice to attach to the audio. Is it telepathy, and if any of you know a telepathic person, ask them to see if they can create a message on the audio of our boxes using telepathy. These are good and valid questions especially for those of you that have made friends with the spirits on a first name basis, with regular visits from same spirit. i am not there yet, but many of you are, and have that close relationship.
 
We have to find a better tool that requires no edits.

I dont see how cutting out dead air or static or clicking can make someone less of a serious researcher.

Joel, I don't think anyone would wait 30 seconds after a question and associate a word or phrase to be the answer to that question. Also in a thirty second period if the researcher has not asked another question and moved onsomeone should try and help them with how they are doing a session. You Know I clip all the useless fragment crap out of my files, are you trying to say you hold your research to a higherdegree than I do? And because the crap sounds are cut from a file does not make it pieced together.If a researcher is taking words from different parts of a recording and putting them together to make a sentencethat would be piecing them together, that would be an out and out fake. As long as the researcher has the original clip to present upon request by a reputable source, that should preventquestions of the files validity. Bruce

if you clip them  and put together  the answer  how will you know that it was a excepted amount of time?if you ask a question  and receive  a answerafter 30seconds  to me and what i post is unacceptable. but then i hold my reasearch to a high degree than most .30 seconds might not sound like a lot  but  your phone rings  7 times  in 30 seconds. any clip i hear that arre pieced together also  i ignore. sorry that just me  .

Hi All,
Here’s my take…or 2 cents worth..:-)
 
Share your files all clipped without the garbage for others to listen to. Save your original files for further development and records, in the case a scientific organization wants to “hear” the original along with the clipped, walahh you have both. And everyone is Happy!

Bruce    To add to what you said, the capacity of the yahoo forum we are with does not permit long recordings and the messages we have been receiving seem to be getting longer and longer each passing month.  Not much room for the "gargage."  I for one prefer to hear the important message words, knowing full well the author edited the file.  If someone wants to present false stuff so that he or she gets false praise from us,  god bless them if they need the praise.  For scientific research with original files...that' s another story.

Stefan, I do remove the "garbage" from my files. At this point in my research, the message is more important to me than the proof of it.I think most of us here will agree that we are receiving some sort of paranormal communication.but it definitely exists. now we need to concentrate on the messages they need us to hear and the answers to the questionswe ask and in turn our answers to their questions. Anyone that cleans a file in this way should not be touching any bit of the filethat has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously garbage like the "EH O EH AH O EH UR" in between words. For example "Is there anyone here that wishes to communicate_ YES_AH ER EEH AR OOO AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE"It is much easier for me as a researcher to be able to return to a file that I recieved two weeks ago and that I believe may hold somerelivence to a message I just received and be able to cleanly listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage sounds. At this stage in real time communication the messages are the top priority.I do however agree that the untouched version should be retained and made available to individuals that make a request for any intelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that may be made, and god knows there are always fanatical sceptics lurking in the shadows awaiting an opportunity to attack an unwary or injured researcher. I do not think that our research files should be made available on request by every tom dick and harry that is unknown to us and may potentiallydoctor the file to suit their own point and post it as such. I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the researcher that receives the request for raw research data should scrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment before handing out any research data. These are my thoughts on the subject of cleaning a file. Bruce

Hi all,just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I wouldsuggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, inorder to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can forinstance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (includingthe experimenter' s voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, butnot cut out individual pieces (supposed "garbage") to make an EVP matchwith what it "should be". At least, the unedited version should alwaysbe provided along with the edited version.But that's only my personal opinion which I thought I had to express, aswe should always be able to present our results to a critical public.Stefan-- > Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these files.> After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that > section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the message > a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise that > don't belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can't piece these > files together to make something it's not, so i keep them in true > form pretty much to the original.> -Steve> --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Ron Lederer <ronriko@...> wrote:>>>> Hey Steve Forgot to ask...how much editing was needed to get this > file?

You can for<BR>instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (including<BR>the experimenter' s voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, but<BR>not cut out individual pieces (supposed "garbage") to make an EVP match<BR>with what it "should be". At least, the unedited version should always<BR>be provided along with the edited version.<BR><BR>But that's only my personal opinion which I thought I had to express, as<BR>we should always be able to present our results to a critical public.<BR><BR>Stefan<BR><BR>-- <BR><BR>&gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these files.<BR>&gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that <BR>&gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the message <BR>&gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise that <BR>&gt; don't belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can't piece these <BR>&gt; files together to make something it's not, so i keep them in true <BR>&gt; form pretty much to the original.<BR><BR>&gt; -Steve<BR><BR>&gt; --- In <A href="mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com" rel=nofollow>EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com</A>, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; Hey Steve Forgot to ask...how much editing was needed to get this <BR>&gt; file? Did you need to take out a lot of garbage between words <BR>&gt; withing the message? Ron L<BR><BR></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
