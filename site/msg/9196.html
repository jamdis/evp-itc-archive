          Hi Elizabeth,
 
  I'm sorry to have to tell you this , but getting a Frank's box or building one is just about impossible.
  Frank builds these boxes by hand and it is a very time consuming and tedious job, but for him a 
  labor of love. So he periodically gives a box to someone of his choosing without giving reason.
   
  No one has ever bought a Frank's box for the simple reason that mr. Sumption refuses to accept any money for his boxes.
  There are only about ten people in the world, beside mr. sumption that own a Frank's box.
  How ever there are alternative boxes that work on the same premise and produce the same type of real time live communication
  that Frank's box does.
    
If you decide to try this method, please let me know I will be glad to help.  
  Bruce

        Mis.Lyn told me about his group. Thanks Lyn! I want to build my own Franks Box but I think it is going to be more difficult than I thought.
   Leslie took my digital recorder to the basment to leave it there while she was at work. I am listening to it while I type. We have had a problem with her little boy ghost Robert only whispering when he answers questions. At the begining of the recording I heard her ask Robert to speak up and talk louder LOL!!! I have heard what sounds like a box being shoved across the floor. I will have to show her this.Nobody is at home while this recording is going on.
  Hugs,Elizabeth

Hi Elizabeth,

AHA! You appear here, too!
:-)

No, I haven't done that yet. I dug thru my junquebox of electronic parts 
to gather together what I needed to make one, but didn't have a few parts 
and never got around to ordering them. Maybe one of these days, I hope ...
