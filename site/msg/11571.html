The unit itself could have just gone bad.  I'd take it back and get another one if you can.

interesting. ....
when i tried to talk 'potty-mouth Dave' over to the other side....for some reason my very expensive brand new ( 2 week old) smoke alarm that had never had any issues to that point- suddenly started goin off like crazy ( there was neither smoke, steam, nor fire by the way)
and i ended up having to remove the (brand new) battery to stop it...... every time after that that i tried the bateries again, it did same. manufactures instructions said a low batt. will cause an 'intermitten beep'  but this was full scale alarm, not beep. far as i see it- the unit is fried.
anyone had sometihg like this happen?

Carol, if you don't mind my asking, how did the sage and salt "feed" the energy?

Well, first, we saged and salted. That really fed the energy to the point
we had to leave the house for a few hours. We did the same thing again
and again. Then, a friend in CA called and together, on the phone, we got
rid of it. You should have heard my emf meter beeping it's freaking head
off while my friend sent his energy to get it to go. I had it on the end
of my daughters bed...where usually there is nothing to set it off. Boy,
did it ever react to the "banishing" for lack of a better word. My friend
in CA is a sensitive, and helped me a great deal..I am forever thankful
for him.
