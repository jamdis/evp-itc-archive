<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yesterday I decided to post some files so I posted to a sub folder of 
my main folder in the files section.
I noticed that some people voiced their dislike of sending post notices 
for every file , so I sent none. Just a single post stating that I had 
posted the files and where they could be found.

Now this is the dilemma, If you do not post an announcement for each 
file and you trust that the single post announcing all the files that 
have been posted will suffice, well I don&#x27;t think so!

I know that most individuals here do not listen to or reply to every 
single file posted but I will usually get some comments on the better 
or more interesting ones. So far from the posting yesterday &quot;NADA&quot;

If anyone saw the post I wrote announcing the files I posted to the 
files section, please for my own satisfaction let me know.

Otherwise I don&#x27;t think the one post notice thing is gonna cut it!
