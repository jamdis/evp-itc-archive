I got &quot;orbs&quot; in over half of the still photos I =\r\ntook in random places. Most of them were places like farmer&#39;s fields, shopp=\r\ning malls, country roads, etc. Some were in places that are supposedly haun=\r\nted. These places were not free of dust, insects, etc. Some were in dry wea=\r\nther and some were taken when it was drizzling or raining. I had to conclud=\r\ne that I could not verify that any of them were paranormal in nature. Some =\r\nof them may have been, but based on what I found out, I could not say for s=\r\nure. I did not see any percentage change in the number or type of &quot;orbs&quot; th=\r\nat showed up in random places and those that showed up in haunted places. M=\r\nost of the &quot;orbs&quot; showed up in flash photos. I also got lens flare in a lot=\r\n of daytime photos.\n\nI think the best way to capture &quot;orbs&quot; is with video. =\r\nI have also spent some time looking for things that may have been orbs on v=\r\nideo. Usually I have to say they were also dust blowing around, bits of lea=\r\nves, insects, etc. Rain or drizzle is pretty obvious. A single bright spot =\r\nmoving across the screen at night could be dust or an insect. Large amounts=\r\n of spots moving in unison in a certain direction are for sure dust particl=\r\nes. I&#39;ve seen these move so fast that they were there in one fraction of a =\r\nsecond and gone the next.\n\nI have seen a few things on video that I couldn&#39;=\r\nt be certain of as regular explainable phenomena, though. In one case I saw=\r\n a spot moving along, then suddenly split into two spots which went off in =\r\ntwo different directions. That was definitely not dust or moisture. It coul=\r\nd have been two insects flying together which then separated. That&#39;s the on=\r\nly possibility I could think of other than something paranormal. That one w=\r\nas videotaped in a basement that has a reputation of being haunted. I didn&#39;=\r\nt see any insects at all in the basement while I was there.\n\nThere is one p=\r\nhenomenon I have not been able to explain. I have seen it twice, both in pl=\r\naces that were supposedly haunted (they were not in the same place, though)=\r\n, both taken in total pitch black darkness at night. They were both taken w=\r\nith digital cameras. And in both cases I was standing right next to the per=\r\nson who took the photo and saw it on his camera&#39;s screen right after. They =\r\nwere both orange squiggly lines that zigzagged all over the photo frame. I =\r\nhave never been able to reproduce this phenomenon with my camera.\n\nZack\n\n\n\n=\r\nOn Mon, Sep 24, 2012 at 1:12 PM, &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n\n \n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\nI saw a very good test done once on tv and it was shocking to me. =C2=A0The=\r\n person had 2 cameras at a location, a 35mm and a digital.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;They took s=\r\neveral pictures at the same time side by side, the digital had several &quot;Orb=\r\ns&quot; and the 35mm caught no anomaly&#39;s at all in any of the pictures.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I b=\r\nelieve what could be called an &quot;Orb&quot; for the most part can be debunked quic=\r\nkly as dust, rain, bugs....etc\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;At least 99 percent anyway. =C2=A0I thi=\r\nnk we have more luck in the field using different types of audio for eviden=\r\nce.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Just my thoughts\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;-Steve\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Sent from my iPhone\n&gt;\n&gt;On Se=\r\np 24, 2012, at 10:55 AM, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0 \n&gt;&gt;One photo has multiple &quot;orbs&quot; - this indicates it is most likely dus=\r\nt particle reflections.
