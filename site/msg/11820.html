<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks.
I have emailed Rob recently (and some time back I recall), but 
received no reply to date. He may not be giving out plans anymore, or 
is not monitoring his emails - dont know. 

Only other chance is getting plans from someone who has received them 
already.

&gt; Go to DeadScience.com and write to Rob he has plans for a working 
speakjet box, he has made several of them. and has given out the 
plans to peaple befor.

&gt; Hi, (Im new to the group)
&gt; No actual plans as yet, but have the concept in mind that Im going 
to 
&gt; work into a device. Maybe this will help somewhat...
&gt; 1. Speakjet chip and suitable audio amp.
&gt; 2. PIC microcontroller, configured to talk to Speakjet serial port 
at 
&gt; 9600 baud, including baud sync and flow control feedback from SJ.
&gt; 3. An array of &quot;speak&quot; (ascii)commands programmed into PIC to 
initiate 
&gt; outputting of all specific allophones, as per the Speakjet 
datasheet.
&gt; 4. External sensor of some form (perhaps EMF) that is able to act 
as 
&gt; environmental trigger for allophone speaking.
&gt; 5.PIC sub-routine to allow PIC to read and digitize the sensor 
analog 
&gt; output via the PIC&#x27;s A/D input(s).
&gt; 6 PIC sub-routine to link incoming sensor data to the selection of 
&gt; allophone output, depending on sensor level thresholds, etc and 
perhaps 
&gt; a random selection process.
&gt; 
&gt; There is a Yahoo group dedicated to the Speakjet chip, but it wont 
be 
&gt; of much help in this case. The core work is in the PIC programming.
&gt; 
&gt; Think thats about it for now. Hope this helps.
&gt; regards from &quot;down under&quot;,
&gt; JEFF
