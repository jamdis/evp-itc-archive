This email was about me not being able to open your MP3 files.  You later sent me several files you said were &quot;random&quot; and I could open and listen to all of them...no problem.  I never did find out how you did that and if you will keep doing it on the forum so I can open them.  I still cannot open Steve&#39;s files. None. The suggestion that was made by someone about the problem at your end when using audacity or other editing program that affect the signal and file is probably valid.  I will go to your other email and answer it directly.  Ron\n\nLisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:           Ron--isn&#39;t this the file I worked on before?

I suppose your apple is more sophisticated.  If others are opening your file I would think I should be able to also. \n   \n  I just checked another member&#39;s file and I was able to open and listen to her MP3 file.  So something else is up with you and me.  Also, you had sent me a file via personal email and I am able to open and listen to it.  Will keep trying.
