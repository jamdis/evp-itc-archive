<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Jeremy ~ Yes, I just hacked a 20-125 last night and will be trying it 
out tomorrow when I have the time to actually sit down and do it and 
am not too tired. I agree...frame of mind is definitely important.

I have only done the regular evp with a digital voice rec.
I would LOVE to own an actual box someday, but am happy to have this 
for now.
What&#x27;s a speakjet?

&gt; I&#x27;ve got the 20-125 and an older 12-469 sans speaker and clicking.  
The 20-125 works wonderfully and has produced great results.  The 12-
469 has produced great results also.  Bruce can testify to the 
communication he gets with the 20-125.  
&gt; 
&gt; In the end, it all depends on signal strength and our spirit 
friends capability to communicate, not to mention our state of mind 
when we conduct a session.  There are a lot of variables involved, so 
there really is no one box better than the others in my opinion.  
Although, Frank seems to get some tremendous results with his 
creations.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m actually going to attempt a Speakjet box.  I hope I can get 
past my semi-electronic retardedness and make it work.
