<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks again for everyone who participated!  I admire your courage and motivation to try different methods, see what works, and try to improve everyone&#x27;s understanding of EVP-ITC.

If you recall, on 7/10/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer monitor, right in front of me, and left it there until today, 7/14/2010, noon Denver time.  The experiment was for participants to determine what it was.  Vague or partial answers wouldn&#x27;t be counted (for example, just  colors, shapes, sizes, what it&#x27;s made of, etc): we&#x27;re looking for what it is.  Participants could use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or I suppose any other means they chose.

In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the object at the start of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group.  If you can follow the link, it is here:

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip

The idea was that you could download the file at the beginning of the test, and &#x27;keep it safe&#x27; on your computer.  Then at the end of the test, I would release the password so you could reveal the contents of the file.  That way, you were in control of the original image during the entire test, not me.  

The password for that file is: 123BlastOff
Instructions, if you need them, are also in that RJ folder.

And if you did not care to download the zip file before the test, I will post the final image there too.

So to the results:

Number of participants: 5
Total tries: 8
Ambiguous answers: 0
Correct answers: 0

Object: A radio
Uzipped picture:
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG


So what do the results mean?  All that we can really agree on from this experiment is that no participant, with whatever theories or methods or technology they used, was able to correctly determine the object.  We can&#x27;t say those theories or methods or technologies never work.  Just as we can&#x27;t say they do.  Just that, for whatever reason, they did not work this time.  Readers can take the results, use them to improve or change their methods, or keep doing what they&#x27;re doing.

If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let me know.  I hope to get a new experiment up and running soon.  Since there wasn&#x27;t much participation Mon-Wed, I think the next experiment will be arranged to mostly span the weekends.

Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this first experiment.</pre>
