(Baseball?) (Football?) etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Did you have any hobbies?\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you miss the most?\n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve gotten some interesting responses.  Last year I asked &quot;Do you \nknow \n&gt; what year it is?&quot; and a woman&#39;s voice plainly said &quot;1996&quot;. On one \n&gt; investigation I asked &quot;Do you want us to leave?&quot; and a male voice \nsaid \n&gt; &quot;You just got here.&quot; At another site someone asked &quot;What was your \ncause \n&gt; of death?&quot; and I heard &quot;poisoning&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s funny when the ghosts join in on your conversations even \nthough \n&gt; you&#39;re not asking questions.  Some of them are very playful.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was on one investigation a couple years ago when someone \nasked &quot;Do you \n&gt; know the Cubs are in the World Series this year?&quot;  :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are at the location of a tombstone you can ask if the \nperson is \n&gt; (name on tombstone) or knows (name on tombstone).\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope those help a little bit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, 28 Jun 2007, Steve Hultay wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I want to do another EVP session with the box, but am tired of \nasking\n&gt; &gt; the same questions.
