<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>We&#x27;ve been using the K II for about a year and a half and they&#x27;re ok as a low cost emf 
detector. Moving any emf meter too fast will likely result in false positives but a slow pan 
across a wall to look for electrical ground leaks will increase reliabilty. We look for emf 
fields in excess of 7 milligause, the K II can detect of to 20 milligause. Studies suggest and 
controlled experiments verify that consistant exposure in excess of 7 milligause can result 
in the precieved feeling of being watched or a presense by an unseen force. People 
sometimes feel it&#x27;s an invisible intelligence but really it&#x27;s the brains response to the 
synapse activity.  People sometimes interpret stimuli in a way that is familiar, in the case 
of high emf exposure we think it may be a spirit in the room. 

But that&#x27;s not to say the location can&#x27;t be haunted as well. It&#x27;s just that if a particular room 
has a lot of reported paranormal activity and there is a high emf field then you may want 
to consider that fact in your evaluation of the location. Interesting, there is alternate 
research that suggest that exposure to substantial emf fields and the resulting increase in 
nerve ends firing in the brain that genuine psychic abilities are possible. This was referred 
to in the book Spook by Mary Roach.

Any device can be repurposed as a communication tool including the K II. While some 
users believe that the involutary muscle twitches that occur while holding down the switch 
is sort of like what happens when holding a pendulum, others prefer to have a selectable 
on / off switch on their K II. The manufacturer has started offering that option according 
to some of the local groups that have been selling the modified versions on eBay.

&gt; Good morning all,
&gt;    
&gt;       I have used this meter with great success as well as with great dismay.  I have had 
the meter &quot;pennied down&quot; sitting on a table top, and have a toy in another room respond 
to me without any activity on the meter.  I feel it is the spirit&#x27;s choice and in which manner 
it feels more comfortable in communicating with you.  I have had lights turn off and back 
on again in succession in response to questions and no activity on the meter, and then I 
have had no other responses except the meter, so once again it is entirely up to the entity 
and how it wishes to respond.  In regards to the new apartment building, check the history 
of the land that it sits on.  In a few of my occasions it has been the energy tied to the land 
or former land owners that has caused the activity.  I have done an investigation in a &quot;new 
construction&quot; home site that the family had not moved into yet and the activity was on the 
increase, the new owners bought this piece of property as a wooded lot with
&gt;  no prior establishment being on site, to anyones knowledge that is.  To all of our 
surprise, land records had nothing available for that property other than the location and 
the pertinent info, however further research and many phone calls later it was discovered 
that the property sat on the edge of a local Indian tribal settlement from the 1700&#x27;s 
(thanks to the Dept. of the Interior and the Bureau of Native American (Indian) Affairs.  It 
just goes to show you that persistence and continued research pays off in the long run 
( this one took about 4 months to research).  So Travis just keep checking and get all you 
can on the property from as far back as you can, you never know what you might fond out.
