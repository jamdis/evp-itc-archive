I'm not sure who you're talking to about "holier than thou".=C2=A0 But, you=
 are the one who keeps dismissing any question about results and testing wi=
th phrases like "Bite Me". I don't see anyone else doing that, and I certai=
nly never have.

I agree trying new things is good.=C2=A0 And discussing re=
sults.=C2=A0 And looking for new directions.=C2=A0=C2=A0 So I'm still not s=
ure who you are upset with.=C2=A0 Perhaps you could be more specific: quote=
 what you have found objectionable, and let us know why?
