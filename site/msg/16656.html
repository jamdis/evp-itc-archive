<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>ITC is different from EVP. Many people just let an audio recorder run to
monitor the output of the box to record whatever may show up. And they do
show up.

&gt;  Just adding: thats exactly how it works. When we contact a spirit or see
&gt; one they wont talk &quot;unless&quot; a question is asked. Then they will speak or
&gt; send a picture or noise or whatever.
&gt; Talking to spirits is a series of questions. One you notice that you have
&gt; the ability, then people just look at it awhile, then it hits them to ask
&gt; questions and then they find that the spirits answer things too. :) The box
&gt; is a tool to bring the conversations on the outside of your head. Its a big
&gt; deal. How did this first get thought of, Frank? How did Frank get the idea
&gt; to ask it questions? That is what mediumship is all about.
&gt;
&gt; My son has built one of the boxes. I am trying to get him on here because
&gt; he will do the work for me of building them. I help a little from having 6
&gt; months of electronics too. This is really going to go far. This is a brave
&gt; new adventure and I am happy to be here.
&gt; Thank you

&gt; Well, I consider myself a &quot;Psychic&quot; too I use a &quot;monitor Technique not
&gt; unlike the CIA was said to employ (I discovered it on my own and later read
&gt; that the CIA was using a similar method) I use a &quot;monitor&quot; or person to ask
&gt; questions and I find I can reply psychically It involves not using the
&gt; &quot;questioning/judgemental&quot; part of my brain and staying in the &quot;declaritive
&gt; mode&quot;--somehow THAT holds the psychic &quot;conduit&quot; open and I can function as a
&gt; medium. The monitor person asks the questions and the replies come. Should I
&gt; ask the question myself, however, the conduit shuts. It IS interesting
&gt; though, I can ask questions indirectly, staying in declaritive mode, by
&gt; saying to my monitor something like &quot;ask me to look at the flag or ask me
&gt; what color is his coat---The monitor asks and THEN I get my answer--I stay
&gt; concious, but with a slight &quot;buzz&quot; and often the info does not go to my long
&gt; term mem ory.
&gt;
&gt; My suggestions on how the boxes work are based on my own years of
&gt; experience with random viewing fields. once it became obvious how THEY
&gt; worked, it was a simple thing to see the correspondence with audio factor in
&gt; boxes. One thing the boxes have taught me, however, is that it is NOT &quot;all
&gt; in the head&quot; as these sound files can be shared with others.---This is
&gt; making me rethink that my VIDEO random feild stuff may also not be &quot;in the
&gt; head, and perhaps may be captured on imagery.

&gt; &gt; You&#x27;re making alot of presumptuous statements that have no basis in fact.
&gt; &gt; You&#x27;re just jealous cuz you can&#x27;t hear the boxes. I don&#x27;t need any noise
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; hear spirits, and I do just fine seeing through the third eye. It&#x27;s just
&gt; &gt; that same old skeptic BS that it&#x27;s all in the brain.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The random sounds make it easier to hear spirit voices in your head. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; discovered this effect VISUALLY staining at rsndom dots on a viewing
&gt; screen.
&gt; &gt; &gt; In the visual mode the spirit only has to suppress the light spots and
&gt; &gt; &gt; enhance the dark spots that do not match the image it is
&gt; sending----Light
&gt; &gt; &gt; and dark spots on the screen that correspond to the image dont have to
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; modulated at all---the result is a SAVING of &quot;psychic energy&quot; on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; observers part, perhaps not much, but enough to make the difference
&gt; between
&gt; &gt; &gt; seeing and NOT seeing, however. Random sound would work the same way
&gt; only
&gt; &gt; &gt; the frequencies that did not match the sounds being sent would have to
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; blocked or replaced, the frequencies already present would NOT have to
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; modulated--so SOME energy is saved and not as much effort is needed to
&gt; hear
&gt; &gt; &gt; the entity. Effectively enhancing one&#x27;s innate abilities. It a lot
&gt; easier to
&gt; &gt; &gt; hear a spirit sound if some of the waves are already in place, than it
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; be if you had to build the entire word from scratch.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That doesn&#x27;t surprise me at all. I wish someone could figure out why
&gt; &gt; &gt; using the box enhances one&#x27;s abilities as a medium, but apparently this
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; so -- I know it was true for me. As much experience as you have, Frank,

&gt; &gt; &gt; would seem to follow you&#x27;d have built up some considerable ability.
