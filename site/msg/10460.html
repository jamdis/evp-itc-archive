I think it is all an alter ego problem, certain people think they are blessed to have one of your boxes.  Hell I could only wish to have one myself, but I know that their is not enough to go around, and also know that I probably will never be able to get one.  So I'm content to have my Radio Shack Hack, without the ego problem.  That's fine with me, I feel great about being a member of this group, and making some friends.  Maybe some day I might be able to use what I learn from y'all to build something for myself.  
   
  Later Guys, and have a great day

I don't know if these people were like this to start, or if it's an external influance, but it's discouraging. There seems to be a similar reaction with systems not made by me--so I've been told.
 
 Soooo, maybe burn some white candles, and maybe get a Rosary. My guys talk about the Catholics, and the Purple Princess has a Catholic connection on the etheric levels, although the church imposes too many limits on her. I wouldn't want to go into a state of fear, but a little protection stuff couldn't hurt. 
 
 Not only do I not have the time to mass produce boxes, I'm beginning to think it's not a good idea anyway.
