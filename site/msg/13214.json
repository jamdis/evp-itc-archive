I cannot make out\nwhat the silkscreen labels read, and although there isn&#39;t an interface\nribbon or connector, do you think this would be something that if you\ncould identify the mute circuit solderpad, could the traces on the\nboard be cut with a hobby knife on each side of the pad?\n\nProbably a redundant question that had already occured to you, but I\ncouldnt read those labels so I thought I would ask anyway.\n\nthanks\nAndy"}
