<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have to submit that I have no clue how you guys can tell the  
difference between &quot;Thompson&quot; and &quot;Tom&#x27;s Son.&quot; We tend never to  
pronouce the P in Thompson, anyway. I have to believe it is Thompson,  
or Thomson, as I have gotten the same name twice before and again  
later in this audio section. I suspect Jason is another technician,  
but of course, I&#x27;ll ask.

I&#x27;ve been noticing that this is making me very tired--unnaturally so.  
I think I may need a break.
