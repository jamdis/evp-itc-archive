Some skeptics ignore all positive evidence, just like some believers ignore=
 all negative evidence.

From what y=

Also, from what you posted, it did not say=

"We have conducted a few listening studies of reported radio-=

=C2=A0
We are pretty=

 is amplification of a weak telekinetic signal via stochastic resonance and=
 we have found that the optimum audio-frequency signal for this is a chaoti=

<div>No. It's the dorks that try to claim=
 scientific testing to make something like the boxes go away, despite the f=
act the countless users get verifiable information almost daily through the=
 box, and yet these crackheads deny-deny-deny! ! Need I remind anyone how m=
any times "science" has been wrong--over and over and over--it's a freaking=
 useless discipline, all it does is build egos! </div>

<div> It's probably not kosher to post this, but I find t=
his highly insulting to all of us. As usual, ignore all facts and all other=
 methods, such as EVPmaker, which forms all the voices inside the comp=
uter. Ignore all phone EVP messages, ignore all voices heard with no electr=
onic aids. Ignore messages received via turned off TV and printers--and on =
and on, yet they know all about EVP..Ignore the fact that probably thousand=
s use boxes successfully.</div>

"We have conducted a few listening studies of reported radio-sweep EVP and =
the results have not been good. We have also worked with a variety of such =
devices. Based on what we know about trans-etheric influences, how EVP and =
visual forms of ITC are formed and what we know about mediumship, it is dif=
ficult to fit radio-sweep into any established hypothesis. Without solid re=
search supporting it as producing EVP, it is impossible for us to recommend=
 it or support its use. If there were double-blind studies conducted by exp=
erienced researchers that shows it does produce phenomena, we would gladly =
promote it as an alternative technique.<br>
 <br>We are pretty sure th=
at, in transform EVP (ordinary recorder), the voice is formed in the electr=
onics by transforming available audio-frequency noise in an active part of =
the electronics such as a transistor junction. We think the process is ampl=
ification of a weak telekinetic signal via stochastic resonance and we have=
 found that the optimum audio-frequency signal for this is a chaotic one ri=
ch in voice-frequencies with many transient perturbation. That is our worki=
ng hypothesis. "</div>
