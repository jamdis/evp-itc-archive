Anyhow i recently bought a \ngermanium diode and also a tape recorder.  Is anyone familiar with how \nto setup the diode with my tape recorder to help &quot;enhance&quot; my chances \nof recieving a EVP recording?  I was hard to get these dang diodes, but \nnow i dont know what to do with them.  I have a sodder gun and some \nwire, but no clue what to do with any of these parts yet.  Also I had \nsome questions about the SpirtComm device and if anyone here is \nfamiliar with how to construct one (i would like to and already have \nthe rough diagram available online).\n\nThanks\nRyan"}
