Even what I do with the boxes is\n&gt; &gt; surppassed by the new comers, and they get more better results, so why hang\n&gt; &gt; on to the old stuff?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Wed, Jan 20, 2010 at 5:37 PM, judy_in_hollywood &lt;\n&gt; &gt; Ticket_to_Heaven@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  . . . . . . . . &gt;&gt;  Hi Frank, and All,  NO, No No!  I did not mean my posting to be negative, what I meant was to let people who would like to know more about what has been done & is being done + history of getting EVPs (& ITC&#39;s)is all about (which DOES include your Boxes, to ya know, as there are many people who are interested IN EVPs/ITCs, but don&#39;t know certain things about it!  I have a friend in Illinois who would like to try getting EVPs, but really has little knowledge of it&#39;s history or various ways to do this kind of experimental work/research!  Hope I&#39;ve cleared this up, so it&#39;s better understood!  I hope THIS site is NOT only for &quot;Frank&#39;s Boxes&quot; but others as well.  Thanks.  =Judy=\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just thought I&#39;d drop in to let you know Tom emailed me regarding Sarah\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Estep&#39;s TEAC A 6300 reel to reel tape recorder, she used with a standard\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dynamic mic, plus told me www.AAEVP.com &lt;http://www.aaevp.com/&gt; is now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; www.ATransC.org &lt;http://www.atransc.org/&gt;, so thought you all should know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - for more researching info.! PEACE! =Judy=\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\nWell, Here was my reply, but I doubt anyone came to check it out, nor went to the site I posted - for referance/history - info.!  Oh, well.  =Judy="}
