I own Frank&#39;d box and really am impressed with it.  I also enjoy listening to what others on here are experiencing. I have better results tuned to the FM station. The one thing that baffles me is I keep getting a child&#39;s voice which has nothing to do with radio programming at 5 AM, or at least I don&#39;t think so.\nDiane"}
