I suppose if it&#39;s the old 12-469 (the one that doesn&#39;t click-click-click) that&#39;s a \nreasonable price, considering the units are no longer available commercially, and the old 12-\n470&#39;s are very scarce.  I haven&#39;t tried the 20-125 or the 12-820.  I guess for $50, actually \nLESS than, one of these would be the way to go, since both are readily available.  Perhaps the \nmajority of people aren&#39;t yet aware that these other units are also hackable?\n\nMargaret \n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On ebay I just saw a RS12-469 in a auction and the bid was $49.95.  I can&#39;t believe this \nshit that people try to pull off."}
