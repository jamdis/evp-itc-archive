"What We Have Found
We have found moderately strong correlations between t=
he amount of daily global geomagnetic activity and the occurrence of epilep=
tic seizures, aggression, immunological responses, and ambulatory behaviour=
. Even the propensity to report experiences about death and crisis of other=
s is associated with quiet periods of geomagnetic activity. Certain increme=
nts of activity, which are likely to reflect different "complex patterns", =
have been implicated in the occurrence of Sudden Infant Death and electrica=
l cardiac anomalies resulting in death in subpopulations of adults. A corre=
lation between two variables does not necessarily mean causation. Consequen=
tly we have imitated specific geomagnetic patterns by the special applicati=
on of a computer technology. When we simulated these natural conditions in =
the laboratory by applying experimentally generated magnetic fields within =
the 50 nT range seizures in epileptic rats were elicited with the same inci=
dence and latency as those associated with increases in natural geomagnetic=
 activity.
 
                                                   AND
 
 
Wha=
t we have learned
We have found consciousness can be described as an emerge=
nt property of the complex electromagnetic process generated from predictab=
le biochemical and biological processes. Although the terms soul and mind m=
ay have been useful at one time to describe this process, they are no longe=
r required. They are more like the term "phlogiston" that was employed to d=
escribe why things burned before modern chemistry emerged. When there is no=
 electrical current moving through the parts of a television, there is no p=
icture. When the specific electromagnetic patterns are not generated within=
 the brain structures there is no consciousness or awareness. 
Some individ=
uals with very different brain structures show different electromagnetic co=
rrelates that are associated with their ability to discern stimuli others c=
annot detect. Counter clockwise rotation of weak magnetic fields around the=
 skull at specific rates of change (derivatives) can affect subjective time=
 and allow the average person to experience many of the altered states repo=
rted by practitioners of mystical traditions as well as "paranormal" phenom=
ena. The critical variables, like any chemical reaction, are the complexity=
 and specificity of the temporal parameters. One component of consciousness=
 may be "sequestered" within second or third derivatives of very narrow ban=
ds of changes in frequency within the theta range. Our calculations of reso=
nance, based upon the power changes within quantitative electroencephalogra=
phic measures, suggest that one electromagnetic source of consciousness may=
 actually exist within the 10 cm region outside of and surrounding the cran=
ium."
 
 
 It seems to me this guy attemptes to explain everything in terms=
 of brain alone, interesting, but to easy for the skeptic to grab this as a=
n explanation for everything.  So where are these magnetic fields when one =
meditates unassisted, or has an out of body expereience-unassisteted.  I me=
an without using meditation gogles, or sounds. What about when you see obje=
cts behind you, out of your field of vision, what about seeing through soli=
d objects in a normal waking state conciosuness? Persinger's articles seem =
interesting, but I think it's just another attempt to fit every expereience=
 into a neat little box.  I just wanted say I don't think the magnietic inf=
luance explains everything, but it's still interesting in that the part abo=
ut global geomagnetic influance caught my attention. Like what if that affe=
cts the boxes as well? There seems to be areas in my basement where the box=
 doesn't work. I'll have to make sure I have all the bugs, and malfunctions=
 fixed, then do some more testing. Wonder how it works in fault(quake) zone=
s?
 
I guess the magnetic fields could be weak, and in continuous flux all =
over the planet. Mostly this is thinking with my fingers (thinking out load=
).
