Uh oh.. Could that be the whole problem?  I think I did bend a couple of th=
e pins when I clipped the mute one, and maybe I didn't get them straightene=
d out perfectly.  I would be so proud if I could actually get this working =
again by myself!

  For me the tricky part w=
as getting the pins lined up to go back into
  the edge connector after the=
 mute pin has been cut /removed. It's easy
  to misalign them and bend one =
by accident. -Bill
