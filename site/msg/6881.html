Robin:
             I don't think you motives are selfish at all.  I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason and that people are brought into your life for a purpose as well.  You are lead down certain paths, some which you have not clue as how they came about, but nevertheless your on that road. 
   
              I truly feel that the otherside knows of the sincere dedication of many in this group (for the files prove this) and hope the best is yet to come. There are a lot of new comers to box research and hope that with everyones contributions we will all be able to get some of the answers we seek as well as reconnected with our loved ones who have gone before us.

    Robin,
 
I very much appreciate your comments and confidence in me, but at the end of the day I'm no different than anyone else.
The only thing that may set me apart from some of the other researchers here is that I have a bit more experience and 
being disabled allows me a lot more time for research. I am always willing and hopefully able to help new researchers with 
my advice and knowledge I have gained through experience. But my ideology is not the end all explanation or truth of box research
all opinions here are valuable and deserving of consideration and attention.
 
As for your question, the fact that I am blessed enough to receive a fairly good level of communication I believe is based once 
again on the relationship I have built with my tech/guides and the synchronization of energy we have developed.
The level of communication we are at I believe is only the very tip of the iceberg. My goal in "MY" research is to reach a level of communication that 
allows us to speak easily and freely with our spirit friends in a fluid and continual fashion as if having a pleasant telephone conversation.
 
The gist of the messages I am receiving now are directed toward our spirit counterparts achieving the same goal. It is already a comfort to me to know they are there and I have had the opportunity to speak with close family members and friends that have crossed over. And also recently Ms. Sarah Estep who has made the transition and is beginning to work now on the
spirit side to further the communication. Any information I receive from the spirits I recognise to be friends is invaluable. Something as simple as a yes or no answer to a direct question that has just been asked is a small miracle in and of itself. considering how it was attained and where it is from. Most researchers I think after a certain amount of time succumb to the human flaw of complacency and take for granted that when they turn a box on they will receive communication. They loose site of the fact that this communication is a precious gift to mankind and eventually will change the way we perceive life and death.
 
I don't know if my thinking or opinions are lucid or the rantings of a mad man, I'm sure a lot of people would say both. For what it is worth this is how I believe on the questions you asked.
for better or worse.

          It's always refreshing to read your input Bruce.  Funny thing is, I recognize Mike and Lisa on your recordings too.  I'm aware that they are acting as facilitators and guardians, that they are consistent in their ability to use varied modes of communication, and that their contact appears to be purposeful, as compared to so much that seems to have no rhyme or reason.  
   
  As a newbie I'm admittedly intimidated by and in awe of the results you more experienced researchers are accomplishing.  What I find most awesome is that everyone can have different methods, belief systems and opinions and come together in one forum to share and learn from one another.  I feel so lucky to have found you!  Bruce, your ability to hear and accurately repeat my one posted EVP is the only validation I've personally ever received that makes me know I'm involved in something real and life altering.  I'm supposed to be here!  I think a big part of my education will continue to come from the knowledge and experience you all are willing to keep sharing.  It's also a fact that each of us needs to find his/her own individual truth.  
   
  I'm still troubled by the possibility that we could be pawns in Someone Else's science experiment.  I can sense Frank's cynicism related to the messages being meaningless and the messengers being untrustworthy.  In your own case, what is the goal?  Is the fact that you've established communication and continue to communicate enough?  Are we hoping to gain invaluable information from our guides, or just to have the comfort of knowing they are there?  
   
  This is the week I've promised myself to start doing sessions with the Radio Shack hacks!

    Robin,
 
I agree with Steve on a couple of points. First let me say that I
do believe that we all have a "technician/guide/guardian" call them what you
may. but I usually call them by the names they introduced themselves by.
 
I know for a fact through many, many, many box sessions that when I turn
a box on, could be Frank's box or the minibox or the RS 470 does not matter which.
 
The same two entities will come through immediately, So much so now, that I do not even ask for conformation that
it is in fact them. I recognise their individual voice patterns. I have built a solid relationship with these two spirits
I know as mike and Lisa so much so that I have even gotten to know their individual personalities.
 
There are other newer researchers here that will attest to the fact that when they where doing their first sessions
I had asked my two "Friends" Mike and Lisa to assist in getting them started and invariably the spirits that came 
through to these new researchers during their first sessions identified themselves as Mike and Lisa.
 
Steve says he does not turn on his box and use them as a crutch, that is not entirely true. I had done research 
very closely with Steve until recently and I would venture to say that 99% if not every session he starts with "Mike & Lisa
are you available to talk with me" 
 
Also I don't consider working with my technicians as using them as a crutch, They would not allow that.
They are not there like butlers at our beckoned call when we feel they may be of some use.
Quite the opposite, without them we would get no communication at all, they are allowing us the honor of receiving this 
celestial communication. They are the moderators, facilitators and generators of all we hear and send to and from the spirit realm.
And they also stand as guards and protectors to do the best they can to keep us from being deceived or taken down a dark path.
 
Some here wait for others to state an opinion and then tend to agree with that opinion no matter what they have experienced to be true.
 
Robin, my advice to you as a new researcher in this field. Form your own beliefs through your experience and research.
Listen and learn from others but do not let what you believe to be true or not, be swayed by popular opinion.
 
Bruce

          Steve,
   
  I certainly appreciate your thoughts.  In the back of my mind is always the question of whether we are being Deceived.  Just for the sake of argument, is it POSSIBLE we're being manipulated by something evil?  I'm not frightened, and I won't stop my own research (the negative stuff just makes me more determined), but my mind does go there sometimes.  I hope that along with developing my "ear" I can acquire the gift of discernment.

  Robin,

If i may add my thoughts on this: There is no concrete evidence of 
who or what comes through is what they say they are. Technicians i 
have found were used to get you up and running and i only now call on 
them if i need assistance. I don't turn the boxes on and ask for 
them like a crutch, i conduct my session and if i need help they will 
supply it to me if needed. I think the whole idea is to find out who 
we are communicating with, maybe we will never really know for sure 
but i still try and find out as best as i can.
