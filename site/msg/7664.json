You have a couple options.  You can use this free converter program (I&#39;ve not \ntried it but have read from others that it&#39;s good):\n\nhttp://www.softwarepile.com/audio_converter.html\n\nOr you can play the file into Audacity via a patch cord from the ear jack of your recorder to \nyour sound-in jack on your computer (rather than transferring the file using the USB).  If \nyou want to export a file from Audacity as an MP3, you will also need to download and \ninstall the LAME add-on.  \n\nhttp://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/\n\nHope this helps some.  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Michael Edwards &lt;f1cracker75@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I used my 12-469 for the first time this morning, and ran a 4 minute tape session. One \nof the questions I asked was, &quot;When a person dies, do they see a white light?&quot;  After I \nasked this question the second time, I got a very distinct and crisp YES.  How can I save \njust that section of the file? Do I need to do that in the recorder, or can I do it in the .wave \nfile I now have saved on my computer of the whole recording.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Mike Edwards Cary, NC\n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Looking for last minute shopping deals?
