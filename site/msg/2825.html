Hi All;
 
 I tried to post a couple box video's on you tube last night, th=
ey should come up if you do a search on Ghost Box, Frank's box, ITC, EVP, o=
r paranormal, or maybe "PurpleAlienGirl" (user name). It's my first attempt=
, so I'm not sure if it worked, and it's blocked here at work.
 
 BTW, I'm =
not sure if the Purple Princess stuff puts people off, that's who my guys s=
ay I am, and I accept that as an axiom. As if it matters, but that's an "ot=
her level" identity, and has little to do with physical conditions. Purple =
is a treacher, that's all, I just happen to be a very poor teacher.
