<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Laura, your comment was offensive. It did not come off as  
lighthearted. I&#x27;m not saying Bruce was right to respond in kind. I&#x27;m  
saying there is clear conflict of interest here.

I asked Misty to respond. I did ask you to lecture me on my attitude.  
I have neither been insulting to you personally not flamed anyone. I  
have asked for the list owner to make her opinion known and her  
reasons to support her decision. I have that right. If you don&#x27;t  
agree, I&#x27;m very sorry. I suppose you can use your ban button again,  
if you want.

&gt; I brought up a point in a lighthearted way, and it was NOT ABUSIVE,  
&gt; but being abusive and attacking and degrading ones character is a  
&gt; totally different scenario. There are 3 Mod’s on the board, and we  
&gt; discuss, before choices are made. I am sorry if you are feeling  
&gt; conflict with is forum, if your unhappy and want to un-join the  
&gt; choice is yours, we would certainly hope you will re consider and  
&gt; have a better attitude with more harmony and respect to all that  
&gt; post without defamation of character and abusive language.

&gt; The person who began the issue with an offensive comment of her own  
&gt; comment ought not to be the one suspending Bruce for responding to  
&gt; it. My opinion. Your milage may vary.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Misty, this is a decision for a list owner. I think that is you and  
&gt; no longer Frank.

&gt; Jeff,
&gt;
&gt; Mind your buisness and go back to the kiddie table.
&gt; your not supposed to get involved in real peoples conversations.
&gt;
&gt; before you open your mouth read the post that this post was in  
&gt; reply too.
&gt; who are you to suggest anything, when was the last time anybody
&gt; saw any research or files from you? OOPS I forget nobody EVER did.
&gt;
&gt; Stop sticking your mouth where it does not belong.

&gt; That lost comment was uncalled for and extremely rude.  If you want  
&gt; to make comments like that then I suggest you make it offline in  
&gt; private email.

&gt;
&gt; First off the reason I got a new box From Frank is because he  
&gt; recognises that
&gt; I am a serious researcher, It does not have anything to do with  
&gt; being a man
&gt; or woman. It has to do with being deserving of a Frank&#x27;s box and  
&gt; evidently!
&gt;
&gt; Well do I have to spell it out? Start putting some time into your  
&gt; research instead of
&gt; taking tantrums and maybe someday you&#x27;ll have a Frank&#x27;s box, But I  
&gt; doubt it!

&gt; hey guy&#x27;s
&gt;
&gt; I have been lucky enough to not only have Frank&#x27;s box #12 but now  
&gt; Frank
&gt; has gifted me with a brand new box #29.
&gt;
&gt; Here are the first files to come out of it. And it has not even been
&gt; imprinted by mike and lisa yet. These files are from the first 30
&gt; seconds of the first session.
&gt;
&gt; let me know what you think.
