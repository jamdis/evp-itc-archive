<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s the same old trap, over think the be geesies out this stuff and wonder why it don&#x27;t work. Spirit exists in a higher demension, as such they have full access to everything we have here--on our lower demension/level. They will use what we use, why over complicate the stuff? To make it more difficult for them, or us?

 Supply raw audio-bits of speech, music, and nosie, and they talk. Simple is better, you can sweep the radio by hand, it works, and doesn&#x27;t take a degree in thinkology to figure it out! 

 
 Yeah, I get irritated cuz I have to restate this over and over and over and over. Everyone wants it super high tech, and super complicated, or it just can&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s a freakin&#x27; radio! Use radio cuz the possibilities of bits of human speech, music and noise are infinite. It&#x27;s convinient, you turn a dial on a $2 radio and they talk, no it is not the stupid brain matrixing BS the debunkers would have us believe. 
 
 If ya still think spirit is somehow deminished humans, try EVPmaker &quot;they&quot; manipulate the sound INSIDE the computer, as data bits! But wait, there&#x27;s more! We can create our own &quot;voices&quot; just by thinking about it, if we are not carefull, we creat the evidence we want! It seems to work subconciously, but I bet with practice anyone--living- could learn how to communicate via EVP. hmmm, faster than light communication?  Who needs that concept?

 I know, different ideas, ultra sound, light, RF. The common idea, convert it to human hearing, so why not start with sound in the frist place?

&gt; 
&gt; First off, there are some diagrams, I believe, in the Files or Photos
&gt; sections of some of Frank&#x27;s boxes. There&#x27;s really not a lot to it. Get
&gt; a radio with electronic tuning capability and build a sweep circuit.
&gt; Frank just posted a circuit for a sweep the other day. You could even
&gt; do manual tuning with an analog radio by tuning the knob up and down.
&gt; 
&gt; Why do you need to record above 20 kHz? You can&#x27;t hear it. No one that
&gt; I know of has captured any EVP or ITC even close to that range. Most
&gt; of my EVP have been in the lower normal human voice range.

&gt; &gt; Hi!
&gt; &gt; Can anyone help me out in making a Frank&#x27;s Ghost Box...with easy steps of
&gt; &gt; assembling the components...i would really appreciate ur efforts..
&gt; &gt; Secondly i have a question for u guys....i am using sony IC recorder model
&gt; &gt; ICDPX820 533 hours recording for EVP but the limitation of this IC recorder
&gt; &gt; is that it records in MP3 format which is not required as wav format is more
&gt; &gt; reliable and is closest to what u actually hear. and the next is its
&gt; &gt; frequency range is 75 hz to 20 k and above 20 k it does not record any
&gt; &gt; thing...
&gt; &gt; so what is the best model available for EVP recording and is there anything
&gt; &gt; which can be modified in the sony IC recorder so that it can record freq of
&gt; &gt; more than 20 k...
&gt; &gt; Hey i know it is time taking to answer these questions..but i ill be obliged
&gt; &gt; if somebody out of u help me out....
&gt; &gt; Thanks
&gt; &gt; Regards
