Lately I&#39;ve been going &quot;noiseless&quot; and just letting the audio \nsnippets come through... but when I do use it, I like the white.\n\nI guess because there is such a history with EVP and white noise.  \nThey are like a team from way back.  So many EVP pioneers used it.\n\nGood idea you have with the DVD and looping track.  Any way you can \ninsert the noise is helpful.\nI haven&#39;t used any brown or red... how is that working for you?\n\nAnd thanks for the kind words...\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ourobouros2k2&quot; &lt;ourobouros2k2@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike, quick question...I have been experimenting with a multichannel\n&gt; system inspired by your spiricomp system. Rather than adding the \nwhite\n&gt; noise at the computer recording stage, I have a standalone dvd \nplayer\n&gt; with a looping track. I have experimented with white and pink noise\n&gt; tracks, but was just curious which you have had the most success \nwith.\n&gt; I also made a brown/red noise track, and wondered if you had\n&gt; experimented with that at all. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance, you work has been very helpful in getting me\n&gt; started down this road.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Andy\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot;\n&gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For those who care to see...
