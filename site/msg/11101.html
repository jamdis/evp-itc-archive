<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi everyone New and Old ( meaning been here awhile LOL not age ),

 It&#x27;s me Ralph the Ghost Hunter again. I see things have changed since 
I been away. Seems more civilized and that&#x27;s a good thing. Well juat 
wanted to tell you all about some EVP&#x27;s I got at my place of work. It 
seems we have a portal to Hell or something in our men&#x27;s room LOL. I 
have gotten quite a few EVP&#x27;s(Tradional) in the men&#x27;s room. This past 
few days I got a couple of interesting ones. I was on break from work 
so I took my DR60 digital recorder and decided to check the room for 
any spirits. I was in the stall(lol) asking if there were any spirits 
there with me, when I looked at my recorder and didn&#x27;t see it pick up 
anything(have it on VOR activation)so I decided to go to the sink area.
I start asking if there are any spirits here with me and I said Is 
anyone here? I saw that the recorder was picking up sound. So I played 
it back and I heard someone say ( mind you I was all alone )&quot; Here 
comes Lucifer&quot; then after I asked &quot; Is anyone here ? &quot; A weird voice 
says &quot; There are all kinds of Spirits ... here (here is kind of hard 
to hear).&quot; So I&#x27;m thinking if the first voice said &quot; Here comes 
Lucifer &quot; the second voice might have been &quot;Lucifer&quot; himself saying of 
all the Spirits there. It&#x27;s a creepy EVP to say the least. So what do 
you think could it have been Lucifer and could I be picking up a 
straight line to Hell or what ? Just something to think about. I got 
goose Bumps just thinking about it. Well anyways that&#x27;s what went on. 
I hope you people are all doing okay. I also think I have taken a 
picture of a shadow person down in Gettysburg in the Triangular Field 
this past Nov. I&#x27;m still studying it. Hey it&#x27;s nice to see everyone 
getting along that&#x27;s great. You all take care and I will let you know 
of what other things I get in my search for the Paranormal. Have a 
great day all.
