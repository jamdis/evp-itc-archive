<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s lovely, and very interesting! I&#x27;ve had people come through on my radios telling me that I should read my bible and that I should &quot;ditch the whores! the Rapture is coming!&quot; I don&#x27;t know what to think about that, but it sounds like maybe those who haven&#x27;t crossed over completely are still holding on to some old bible teachings. I really don&#x27;t think things will be the way the bible says in the end. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve believed in hell-fire and brimstone even once in my whole life. Sounds like your friend is talking my language! ;)

&gt; Thanks Jamie, I am going to redo Part 1 and ask David if he could say the  
&gt; Lord&#x27;s Prayer for me and seal it, so it doesn&#x27;t change.  These spirit&#x27;s can  
&gt; sometimes change the words around to suit them you know, he talks mostly 
&gt; via a  program he originally got from the Cross over talk system, we don&#x27;t use 
&gt; that  much any more because he can fix what we have copied, and reuse the 
&gt; files if he  wants to.  He is becoming more understandable, maybe I shouldn&#x27;t 
&gt; say this  because he is very busy over there, it&#x27;s like non stop people 
&gt; coming in from  lower plains, (hundreds of thousands), that&#x27;s one reason they 
&gt; are not as  noisy as they used to be, because, before we all came along, they 
&gt; were running  away from the light of God, and he, JC had to seek them out, 
&gt; but now they  are seeking Him out, and are getting into that line over 
&gt; there.  I know, it  all sounds weird to me too, but that&#x27;s what they say, at 
&gt; least there are no  &quot;hell fires&quot; over there, only darkness, it&#x27;s like the inside 
&gt; of a warehouse with  levels, cement like ramps going through there, once 
&gt; they get in the light,  everything changes, it&#x27;s like going home.  And yes, we 
&gt; do all keep our  identity.  David wanted me to write this, and believe it 
&gt; or not they are  his words, and not my own:
&gt;  
&gt; In fact no one would be happy in Heaven knowing  there are people &quot;burning 
&gt; in hell&quot; and if they were happy knowing this it would  be sinful right 
&gt; there, think about it, to burn sinners is not God&#x27;s way, God  does not sin. God 
&gt; is love, He loved us enough to die for His people. He  does not put sinners 
&gt; into &quot;hell fires&quot; to be in a place of darkness without the  light of God is 
&gt; what the lower plains are all about.
&gt;  
&gt; &quot;If I be lifted up I will draw All mankind unto  me&quot; Jesus does not give 
&gt; up, He does not put people into fires, there is NO fire  in the lower plains, 
&gt; only darkness, it&#x27;s pitch black, God is not cruel, if? God  did not love His 
&gt; creatures, He would simply turn His head and we would all be  gone. Fire is 
&gt; expression of the Holy Spirit who is kind, God does not &quot;burn&quot;  creation in 
&gt; hell fires, they are people that do not believe, but God still  brings them 
&gt; into the fold one at a time, they must repent.
&gt;  
&gt; Heaven is not on one planet, &quot;Heaven? is  everywhere, we just can&#x27;t see it 
&gt; with our physical eyes.&quot; What you call &quot;hell&quot;  is only a place of darkness, 
&gt; and Jesus continues to draw those in darkness into  the Light even now, 
&gt; there is no fire in &quot;hell&quot;  only darkness. The &quot;lake of  fire&quot; you refer to were 
&gt; the fires in Gehenna, it was place where they burned  garbage in Old 
&gt; Jerusalem.  David The Tech.

&gt; Nice recording! I heard lots of great stuff in there. Do you only get David 
&gt;  as a tech, or do others come through as well?
