The 12-470 black has a two row IDC header, no markings. on the 12-469 you c=
an pull the mute high
to function or low to un-mute "hence we removed the p=
in"  The 12-470 Black case I have tried every pin on the header
to both hig=
h or low state. Currently I'm building a header breakout so I can try to ef=
fect a change while the radio is running. Just slow going. However  if some=
body finds a simple snip let me know. 

I have turned my attentions to a in=
terface with the 12-469 to change the scan rate and add a random tuning mod=
e.
That's almost done! and I hope to post today or tomorrow.

    Okay... I have been having the oppisite probl=
em with finding a 12-470. The RS stores here have all older models, the one=
 I already hacked. I finally found a store that had one newer model (0607) =
date code and black case. Lets see what I can do with this model.
    Stay =
