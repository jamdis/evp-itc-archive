I don't think "Objective" means what you think it means.

But the point of =
the test it to find a method that will allow the evidence to speak for itse=
lf, and that is not subject to, well, subjective interpretation.=C2=A0 I'm =
sure if you were involved in the testing design, that could be achieved, to=
 keep the results from being biased, and to keep everyone 'honest, as you p=
ut it.

You also said below " If a person doesn't want to hear it, they won=
't".=C2=A0 Yes, this could be a problem with the test, unless a good test i=
s developed, to remove that subjectivity.=C2=A0 It also works the other way=
 of course:=C2=A0=C2=A0 If a person wants to hear it, they will, which is j=
ust as subjectively bad, and can confound the researcher with all kinds of =
nonsensical results, strange messages, failed predictions, and so on.=C2=A0=
 Testing can be a way to better determine how to tell which methods and mes=
sages are the most valid and promising.

I certainly understand that some b=
eliefs are essentially religious faith: people state it is true, and don't =
want anyone to question it.=C2=A0 And I don't want to question anyone's rel=
igion (they get really mad and insulting when you do).

Maybe some people f=
eel that way about EVPs.=C2=A0 I feel that this technology is instead perfe=
ctly applicable to good testing.=C2=A0 There are many theories and approach=
es to EVP and ITC, and I think testing is the best way to determine which w=
orks the best, which equipment people should spend their money on, which th=
eories they should spend most time with.=C2=A0 I'm not sure why anyone woul=
d not want to determine these kinds of things.

But I am now in contact wit=
h the testers and with Karen, and will be happy to keep everyone informed o=
f how this all goes.=C2=A0
