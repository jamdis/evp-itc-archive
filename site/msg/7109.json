I did it for  \n&gt; everyone especially asking that he take it private and not post it  \n&gt; in this public forum.  And for that I deserve to be bashed and  \n&gt; receive a threatening letter.  Would you like to see a copy of this  \n&gt; letter as to how he threatened me and calling me names?\n&gt; And you yourself never mention that he should apologize to me  \n&gt; either.  Have I ever done anything to offend you?  Unfortunately  \n&gt; these are the type of people we are dealing with and again I will  \n&gt; say IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN A PRIVET EMAIL.  Is that so much to  \n&gt; ask?\n&gt;\n&gt; Now after that has been said I would like to wish you luck with  \n&gt; your research on your new box.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff\n&gt; In a message dated 2/11/2008 9:57:46 A.M. Central Standard Time,  \n&gt; lisby@... writes:\n&gt; Respectfully, it was still not the correct one. Bruce should have  \n&gt; been asked to apologize and Laura should have taken ownership of  \n&gt; her comment and apologized, too. (She later chose to apologize for  \n&gt; using the word &quot;balls,&quot; which was so very clearly not at all the  \n&gt; issue.) Instead, Bruce was cut off so that he couldn&#39;t apologize.  \n&gt; You can argue semantics with me all day, but suspension of posting  \n&gt; rights and banning are *effectively* the same thing. No incoming  \n&gt; communication. And I know that I can leave if I don&#39;t like it, but  \n&gt; I can continue to post if I am a good girl.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; And there it remains, and shall, I think.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann\n&gt;\n&gt; On Feb 11, 2008, at 10:28 AM, Frank Ratka wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Just and FYI on the conflict of interest idea.
