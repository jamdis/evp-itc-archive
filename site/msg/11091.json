I keep a notepad handy to take notes. \nAfter all audio has been reviewed, I go back and cut out the bits I\nwant to keep.  If I have 8 hours of audio on an investigation, it\ntakes me at least 2 to 3 times that to accurately process that audio.\n There is no other good way that I know of.  \n\nAllen\nwww.paranormalsource.com"}
