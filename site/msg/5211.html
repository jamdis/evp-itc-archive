<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I must have missed the announced beginning of the experiment. Between
travel and getting over 100 new emails per day it must have slipped
by. I often don&#x27;t get to hear the posted recordings until several days
after they are posted and that&#x27;s assuming they are still on the mail
server.

If there is a set date when new unlabeled files will be posted I&#x27;ll
set my calender and specifically download and listen in a timely
matter then post what I hear. Hopefully this would be after the 20th
of this month.  -Bill

&gt; Hi Bruce   Glad I got 3 out of 4 words in the first test.  Maybe a
contest is needed with prize money...just kidding.  
&gt;    
&gt;   I want to ask you about voice recognition systems that you and
others are doing but I will put that into a separate email.   Thanks
for the opportunity to guess.  I hope to get better at it.   Ron L

&gt;           Hey guy&#x27;s 
&gt; 
&gt; The unlabeled files experiment was a resounding flop!
&gt; 
&gt; Only a hand full of members responded with what they did or did not 
&gt; hear.
&gt; 
&gt; This is how I heard them
&gt; #4_There are three circles
&gt; 
&gt; #8_David&#x27;s just their guard
&gt; 
&gt; The percentage of people that responded that they heard what I had heard
&gt; was about 40% the individuals that heard some of what I heard but not 
&gt; all was about 30% with the remaining 30% hearing something completely 
&gt; different.
&gt; 
&gt; This type of experiment needs to be done on a regular basis with a 
&gt; substantial ammount of participents, otherwise the averages can not be 
&gt; calculated and a general theory formed that is acceptable to most 
&gt; researchers in this field.
&gt; 
&gt; If there is anyone else that would like to have a go at it I will be 
&gt; glad to participate.
&gt;
