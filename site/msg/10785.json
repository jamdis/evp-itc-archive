Since according to Theosophy the next Astrological \nAge, the Age of Aquarius, will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) \nRay (the Ray of Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes \ncalled &#39;The Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius&#39;. According to the \nAscended Master Teachings, Saint Germain is &#39;The God of Freedom for \nthe Earth&#39;.&#39;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Much to do with the Purple Princess, and the seven. I don&#39;t mean \nto sell others short, I just get a different level, and find \nregular &quot;this your auntie&quot; type EVPs kinda useless. Mostly I don&#39;t \npost every voice I get, just the ones that I thought was \noutstanding, but no one else hears.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;   Make i&#39;m yours.
