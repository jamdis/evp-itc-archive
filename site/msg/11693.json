Actually, getting the flash as far away from the lens as possible\nplus either bouncing it off the ceiling or using a diffuser will\nalmost eliminate dust orbs. A speedlite flash is well worth the $$. \n\nTo make this a little more on topic, I have a 469 radio shack hack\nunit. I&#39;ve tried it a few times and haven&#39;t received any messages at\nall yet.
