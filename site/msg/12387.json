As always, I&#39;m trying to use\nslightly modded off the shelf parts for ease of duplication.\n\nParts needed: \n\n- Radio Shack 6&quot; x 3&quot; x 2&quot; project box\nhttp://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062282\n\n- Radio Shack Deluxe Pillow Speaker (these are no longer sold on the\nsite, and on clearance at local Radio Shack Locations.  Of note is\nthis will accept a stereo signal and combine them to mono, instead of\njust ignoring one of the channels as some mono speakers do.\nhttp://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2103574\n\n- Radio Shack Stereo Amplified Listener (33-1096).  This is a small\namplifier with built in sensitive directional mics that are normally\nused for helping hard of hearing people hear better.  You may have\nseen cheaper versions on late night infomercials with spouses using\nthese to listen to the tv at lower levels while not waking their\nhusband/wife.\nhttp://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2104056\n\n- 3 Quartz Plates 2&quot; x 2&quot; 1/8&quot;, from Prism Research Glass, Inc.\nhttp://www.prismresearchglassglass.com\n\n- Hot glue gun.\n\n\nTo mod the pillow speaker, pry open the case with a screw driver. \nYou&#39;ll notice that the wires connecting the speaker to the volume dial\npcb are very short.  You&#39;ll simply need to desolder the wires and\nreplace them with longer length wires.\n\nTo mod the amplified listener, you&#39;ll remove the single screw holding\nthe case together and pry open the case.  You&#39;ll see a piece of\ncardboard with shiny &quot;silver&quot; coating over half the pcb.  Carefully\npull this off (I say carefully because its attached by a single\nsoldered staple and industrial hot glue, with wires hidden underneath\nthe cardboard.  The glue can pull the wires with it as you lift up). \nYou&#39;ll see it comes with dual mics inside, you&#39;ll want to be careful\nto keep the mic heads clean from any particles or accidental contact\nfrom your fingers (always handle them by the attached rubber guards).\n The mics suffer from the same problem as the pillow speaker, short\nwires.  You&#39;ll simply want to desolder them and reattach them with\nlonger length wires.  I then reattach the protective cardboard piece\nwith electrical tape, which I also use to mount it to the echo box. \nLeave the back side off, as it won&#39;t fit anymore with the new wiring. \n\nUse a hot glue gun to mount the pillow speaker and quartz plates\ninside the project case.  Make sure the speaker is &quot;floating&quot; (by\ngluing the foam backing of the speaker) and that the cone is not\ntouching any of the box edges.  Also with the quartz plates, be sure\nto make sure and seal off the two edges of each plate that come in\ncontact with the box walls.  I put a coat of glue directly on the\nplate edges, and then once seated in the box I run along the edges (as\nyou see in the pics) to improve stability.\n\nUse electrical tape (or whatever else you like) to mount the amplifier\nto the echo box on the side.   Make sure and mount it with the battery\ncompartment extended well enough above the echo box so the batteries\ncan be easily replaced when needed.  Bend the mic wires down so the\nmics are inside the echo box.  The wires are sturdy enough so that\nthey&#39;ll &quot;float&quot;.  If you want more support, take the foam discs off\nthe amplifier pcb (the mics were set in to these, and they are glued\non and should simply peel off) and stick them on to the walls of the\necho box.  Then glue the wires to them.\n\nThe quartz plates and the speaker extend about an 1/8 of an inch above\nthe project box edge, so the lid will no longer fit.  You&#39;ll want to\nget some sound proof foam, mount it to the lid, and then fasten it to\nthe box.  Besides sound proofing and protecting the wires from the\nspeaker and mics, it&#39;ll add a little more shock protection to the\nplates if traveling.  You can mount a Velcro faster or any other\nmethod you want so that its sealed tight yet still removable.\n\n\nMarty"}
