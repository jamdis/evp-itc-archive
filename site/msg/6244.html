I think the reply was &quot;ghosts&quot;...though I wouldn&#x27;t allow that to 
imply that spirits do not appear as orbs, too.  

I think of spirits as light bearing, and ghosts to be covered over 
with darkness (their light being hidden).  I have orb photos from a 
lady right after her teenage son passed.  They were gray-ish and 
swirly, the gray color indicating (IMHO) that the light was only 
somewhat covered over by some darkness.  You can see the light and 
the dark in them.  That to me is a ghost orb of a person who had not 
yet moved unto the light, but was held earthbound due to his funeral 
and grieving family.

Darkness to me means &quot;lack of understanding - lost.&quot;  The condition 
of darkness could best be described as &quot;mis-thinking,&quot; thinking 
contrary to truth.  I think the more a person &quot;mis-thinks,&quot; the more 
the light is covered over.  The light is still there, but hidden, so 
to speak.  So, in that sense, it is possible for some orbs to be 
ghosts and not just spirits, as I believe the boy&#x27;s orb indicated.

Just my opinion, after looking at these for years. ;)
