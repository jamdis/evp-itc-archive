I will \nsay it is wrong around 96%...but I have had times when it nearly syncs \nup with an EVP, and one situation where it was saying a bunch of things \nrelated to what I was wearing. Like I said, a hell of a lot of wrong; \nbut I feel that since I use it quite frequently, it almost &quot;reads&quot; me, \nif this makes sense. It&#39;s just like any other piece of technology; they \nare fallible."}
