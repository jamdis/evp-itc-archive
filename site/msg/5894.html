<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, as I think we can learn to shut off the left brain and allow the 
right brain, the creative - emotional side of us to open up and 
connect.  Example: Meditation

&gt;   Mike,
&gt;    
&gt;   Our friends on the other side relay constant subliminal messages, 
ideas and instructions
&gt;   through our dreams.
&gt;    
&gt;   If I had to rely solely on the messages I receive through box 
sessions my knowledge would not be half
&gt;   of what it is.
&gt;   Sometimes I am explaining something to someone and for the life 
of me can not figure out how I know
&gt;   what I know but I know it, ya know!
&gt;    
&gt;   I have gotten answers to specific questions about dream messages 
and visits, and have received a few unsolicited 
&gt;   answers pertaining to dreams when I have asked about something I 
did not understand and was told you will receive it in your dreams.
&gt;    
&gt;   I believe it is their contingency plan, when they can&#x27;t get the 
message across during a box session, they will make sure we get it 
some how.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     You know me and my weird devices... yes I&#x27;ve built another.
&gt;     This one came to me in a dream last night. I think it was 
because some 
&gt;     of you guys were talking about echo chambers.
&gt;     Anyway... when I woke up I went looking around the house for 
stuff to 
&gt;     make this thing before I forgot what it looked like in my dream.
&gt;     I completed it but now I guess I must test it to see if it is 
what I 
&gt;     think it is... an EVP Box, maybe???
