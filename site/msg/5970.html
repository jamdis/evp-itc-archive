"Are you starting the scan on your 3 469's at different frequencies? What is the ratio being mixed? Is it equal between the three? "

Yes, all three are equally spaced on the FM band. The mix ratio is 1:1 or equal.

            Time is absolutely being removed from the audio files. There is so

much more than just listening to the files, you have too look. You

have to train your eyes as well as your ears to make any sort of

judgment. The second I load some of these files, before I listen, I

see problems. I know the site isn't set up to really leave comments on

files with the file but something should be included in the name or

something. Without it, it is not true representation of what the file

is or what has happened between the capture and the post. We listen

and think "Wow! Great catch" but we really do not know. 



Are you starting the scan on your 3 469's at different frequencies?

What is the ratio being mixed? Is it equal between the three? 



I believe that Mark and Debbie Constantino (sp)of Nevada use water

almost exclusively for their recordings. I have found that method to

be difficult in hearing the results. Are you feeling that those

communications are from spirits or earthbounds and what makes you feel

that way?



I've recently started analyzing a 40 min 469 session. The results are

scary. I'd say at this point, and I'm only 1/2 way through, 90% of the

communication is negative in nature and mentions many supposed Demonic

names. The layers of voices are, in many cases, multiple. Often, the

listener hears very little of what is actually said. The voices can be

mocking or downright crude. I have not yet formed an opinion fully but

it would seem to me that these models are easy devices for lower level

entities to figure out how to use. I can not speak of the attitudes or

fears of those investigators present although at times, their voices

are a bit shaky.

You make a lot of good points in your post and I would like to know

who removes time from their recordings. I have never removed time from

my recordings and see no reason why anyone else would without saying

so in an accompanied post.

I have had pretty good results until recently.

When I would ask about my friends on the other side they would tell me

they will look for them. Well about 2 weeks ago the 12-469 arrangement

started generating a lot of interference and feedback. I started

hearing radio static voices as I use to get with shortwave. Not voice

fragments but voices made of static (metallic and robotic). They were

breaking through the sweeping. I had a feeling someone else was trying

to force their way through. Finally the interference got so bad I was

forced to revert back to a simpler method I used before, which is

using fan noise. One of the first messages to come across was from a

familiar voice telling me and I quote, "your method sucks". I have not

used the 12-469's since because of the clear messages I have been

getting using water and fan noise. That does not mean I have given up

>  on the 12-469's but I won't use them again until I am persuaded to

by my friends on the otherside that they are willing to use and adapt

to it. To my knowledge only Misty, Laura and myself use water for

recording.
