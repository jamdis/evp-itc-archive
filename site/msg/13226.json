Thank you to those of you who submitted \nfiles, and to those who explained why it wasn&#39;t possible.\nI now have enough data to produce Part 3 of &quot;Voices From The Scorched \nEarth&quot; video. Part 3 will be a compilation of the other researchers \nITC session files while using the crash debris. Watch for that on \nMyspace and Youtube next week sometime.  I&#39;ll post a link when it&#39;s \nuploaded.\n\nAlso... I&#39;ve decided to attempt another contact using items/objects \nassociated with someone who has passed on.  This person was a very \nunique individual in our community. A person who enjoyed life, and \nwas also a magician by hobby. \nAfter he passed on his family had an estate sale.  I was lucky enough \nto acquire a number of his very personal items including a few \nmagician related items.\nI obtained his magic rings, a magic rope, and a magic magazine in \nwhich I found a huge bonus.  Inside there was a number of old typed \npages of his outlining a magic trick he was working on.  Different \nversions of the trick were detailed.  I was a great find!\nSo... I&#39;ll be using these items/objects to attempt contact or at \nleast see if there is any energy still present within the objects \nrelated to this man or what he was doing with the items.\nAnd I will be doing a video about this ITC session \nresearch/experiment.  Stay tuned...\n\n- Mike C. (UFO Geek)\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com"}
