<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am the founder of Eastern Paranormal (www.easternparanormal.com) . 
We have an award winning site, we actually one for &quot;Best Research 
Site,&quot; with some stiff competition. You can see it here: 

http://www.ghostworldconference.com/paranormalawards.shtml

We actually won against some teams that have the slogan &quot;We 
investigate by purely scientific means.&quot;

I have came across many groups who say, &quot;We investigate by purely 
scientific means.&quot; In English to me that says, &quot;I watched Ghost 
Hunters and wanted to start my own ghost hunting team.&quot; Many have no 
evidence simply because sometimes you have to use the paranormal to 
prove the paranormal.We don&#x27;t know for sure how electricity works, 
but it does. We don&#x27;t know how bumble bees fly, but they do. There is 
a lot we don&#x27;t know. Science is often wrong as well about the 
simplest things. I remember in science being taught that dogs see in 
black and white. No color at all. It was actually a test question I 
got wrong. Now they say dogs do see in color, different than us, but 
no less color (http://www.petplace.com/dogs/can-dogs-see-in-
color/page1.aspx). Pet psychics have said forever dogs see in color. 
How scientific is that? But they were right........Edgar Cayce was a 
very simple man, not very educated. Yet he healed thousands of people 
and was used by many doctors where all hope had been lost. Did they 
ever prove scientifically how Cayce did what he did? Nope. Yet every 
year the A.R.E. foundation is bombarded by letters from people who 
still are being cured using his uneducated, not so scientific 
methods.....

I have several family members in the medical field. One of my closest 
friends is a pharmacist and the other a doctor. We get along great 
because I respect their views and they do not try to impose their 
views on mine.
I am known for my soft spoken ways and a live and let live 
person.....I believe in going to the beat of my own drum, not someone 
else&#x27;s. Being true to yourself is the hardest thing you will ever do, 
but it&#x27;s the best thing you can possibly do for yourself and everyone 
around you. That is my thoughts on &quot;Serious Research.&quot;
