<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree please dont give up Frank. You are the reason I come to this 
site I wanted to learn more about the Franks box and how it works. I 
still find it so mind boggling that you were about to come up with a 
box to communicate with the dead. I have only recorded a few session 
and have already got the message I_see_princess at least the spirits 
all now who started the box research!

&gt; Please don&#x27;t give up.  I am still learning, and I need a teacher.  
Even though we don&#x27;t know each other.  I try to learn something 
everday from you, so I will be able to make my own box one day.   
Even if is a frankinized 12-469, or made from a car stereo.  I with 
ya all the way, even though some stuff I know nothing about, and 
thats why I learn, to get educated on the subject.  I have already 
studying basic electronics.

stuff longer than anyone. Just get all your information from TAPS, 
and Paranormal State, ---- Hollywood! All friggin&#x27; glamor and greed 
and attention seekers, nothing else! And that seems to be all that 
is sought after on these groups. I don&#x27;t have time for this, and 
this not what I made the boxes for!

&gt;  Whatever you do don&#x27;t let spirit speak, try to second guess 
everything, always assume y&#x27;all are so much more advanced.
