<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello All, 
Long time lurker here, got a question.
I got the radio shack rs 469, did the hack and was having a tough time
finding a speaker like the UFO geek uses for his box. I found a
battery powered unit and now am experiencing the clicking sounds. Can
anyone tell me where to find the small single speaker that was shown
in the UFO Geeks hack? I think the batteries are causing the clicking.
Oh also. I attempted to use the radio in a very active cemetary and
the radio immediately locked on the am station 66. There was no sounds
coming from it and each time I set it to search it would go back and
lock. Did I have a hit from the other side and was too green to see that?
Thanks for any and all input, would love to get this equipment going
in the right direction as I keep getting signs of visitations and I
feel as if I is my grandma trying to communicate with me.
thanks,
Michelle</pre>
