{"id": "8364", "subject": "Re: [EVP-ITC] Stefan you have hit on something (EVPmaker experiment)", "author": "Stefan Bion", "timestamp": "2008-03-27T01:52:02Z", "full_text": "Hi Bruce,\n\n&gt; I never had much use for EVP maker but that I guess is because no one\n&gt; has found the right combination of file and program until now.\n\nWell, I wouldn&#39;t say that. There are people out there which did have\nsuccess with this method (including me). I got one of my favorite EVPs\nwith EVPmaker. (It was in German, so I can&#39;t present it here.) But\nyou&#39;re right, the source file is very essential.\n\n&gt; I raised the volume on the responses because My questions Tend to be a\n&gt; bit loud and I do not like for the listener to go from one level to\n&gt; another so abruptly, I also tend to do this with my box files.\n\nBTW, there&#39;s a cool function in Audition / Cool Edit, called &quot;Dynamic\nRange Processing&quot;. A quote from the Help file: &quot;The dynamics processor\nvaries the output level of a waveform, based on its input level. This\nlets you limit or compress the dynamic range of a sample so that the\nperceived loudness is kept below a defined limit, or so that the\nwaveformï¿œs overall dynamic range is kept at roughly the same level.&quot;\n\nThere are some useful presets, e.g. &quot;limit soft -18 dB w/boost&quot; which\nlimits the level to -18 dB and then amplifies the signal, resulting in a\nwaveform with an overall equal volume.\n\nStefan"}
