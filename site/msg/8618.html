 Well, I had a good time, did several talks, and--get this! An investigati=
on. Or rather I kinda tagged along on a group's investigation and used one =
of the boxes. There was entities answering questions, and responding tot he=
 group members. I gave the group the tape, so I won't be able able to play =
those. On my own recordings, the spirits were pretty the same as  get at ho=
me, and even my son come through wiht "My father did this", which I played =
for a larger group. I loaned a box to another group, and they also got enti=
ties to answer questions, and interact. 
 
 RoboBox did perform for a group=
, with at least one meaningful comment. A woman came to the table afte the =
talk, and asked " Do they onokly talk for you"", and immediately RoboBox pu=
t out "for you", followed after a few seconds "Loves to cook", the woman wa=
s a cook!
 
 The whole thing is very energy intense.
