 At least, science has terms for what they cannot see as, "dark matter" "da=
rk energy" "atoms" "various particles" "'quarks" "electrons," "neutrons: "n=
eutrinos" "protons," "Quantum" and many other's which they claim this unive=
rse is made up of, and is held together by a force they have no name for, i=
t is not just gravity.=C2=A0 Science also acknowledges a beginning to the u=
niverse, and the fact that, energy is neither created nor destroyed, yet wi=
th a beginning, this energy had to come from some where else, from some Pri=
me Source, and perhaps outside of the universe or inside, and since there s=
eems to be a plan, it was not a random act by some mindless source, but a p=
owerful always existing energy source, with an intelligent mind, because of=
 the complexity in the universe, it is not some random act..=C2=A0 They, sc=
ience do attest to that which cannot be seen with the eye, yet is still the=

"Science" is the ca=
tegorization of laws,=C2=A0theories and hypotheses that can explain current=
ly observed phenomena and predict future phenomena. If a phenomenon is obse=
rved that doesn't fit the law or theory, then one of a couple things is hap=

There are codified ways to=C2=A0determine which of those it was and to eith=
er re-do the experiment with better observation=C2=A0or to revise the law o=
r theory.=C2=A0Same if a prediction doesn't happen as expected. Science has=
 no emotions or opinions=C2=A0to it.
  =C2=A0
 "Scientists" are human and c=
an=C2=A0have opinions and emotions and=C2=A0faults and get into being autho=
rity figures, etc. Frank, I think you have "science" and "scientists" confu=
sed. It looks to me like your complaints are with "scientists," who are not=
 in fact scientists at all if they are interjecting opinions and authoritar=
ianism. A real scientist will do what I outlined in the first paragraph. No=
 opinions. No name-calling. No skepticism.
 
 Technology is the APPLICATION=
 of a science. James Clerk Maxwell's A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetis=
m was science. Antenna engineering is one of the=C2=A0applications, the tec=
hnology.
 =C2=A0
 But we are dealing with something here that is outside th=
e realm of science. Call it what you will - religion, metaphysics, etc. but=
 we're looking at SPIRITS - something science=C2=A0wishes to=C2=A0ignore as=
 it's not physical. We really don't know much if anything at all about this=
