It&#39;s funny--I heard parts of the \nfirst few messages, but just syllabic cadences in other parts right up until the Lisa messages-\n-I heard everything from then on.  \n\nIt did confirm to me that I may need headphones to listen to many evps though.  I get better \nresults with my ear nearly glued to my computer speaker!  It must look very funny to my kids \nas I listen.... I have some eardrum damage from childhood infections and I&#39;m not sure how \nmuch that affects what I hear.  I wonder how much of what I don&#39;t hear is inexperience and \nan untrained ear and how much can be attributed to the physical damage to my eardrums.\n\nJulie (around but mostly lurking as I&#39;ve little actual experience with evp and am kinda shy \nabout posting)"}
