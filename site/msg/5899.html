Good deal... I knew you would have no trouble with it.  And now...

&gt; I get lots of answers and ideas through dreams--My biggest problem 
is that I don&#x27;t REMEMBER my dreams very well.  This is cute, like a 
boxful of confetti or gummi worms.  Good luck with it Mike!  BTW, I 
got the radio from you hacked last night and it actually WORKS!!  I&#x27;m 
on the road and will try it out in the motel tonight.  THANKS!!!

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   You know me and my weird devices... yes I&#x27;ve built another.
&gt;   This one came to me in a dream last night. I think it was because 
some 
&gt;   of you guys were talking about echo chambers.
&gt;   Anyway... when I woke up I went looking around the house for 
stuff to 
&gt;   make this thing before I forgot what it looked like in my dream.
&gt;   I completed it but now I guess I must test it to see if it is 
what I 
&gt;   think it is... an EVP Box, maybe???
