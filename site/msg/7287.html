I think all spirits use energy to speak, including us. I sometimes get that as well using other methods. Sometimes its a pop sometimes its a few quick tones. As for the realistic voices, I can only say that if I knew them in life to have something to compare it to. 
   
  As for the clips I hear them say 'hungry? mashed potatoes" for the dinner one tho last word is unclear and "good" for the mood one.

Is this fairly common? And what's causing that? Does he need to draw 
energy from the RS469 before he can respond?

Speaking of which, are there technical terms for recordings in the 
spirit's own voice and for ones formed from bits of voices on the airwaves?

I warned you that I had a lot of questions. =)

Thanks!
