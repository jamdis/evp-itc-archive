I think you guys may be in the wrong place. Though we are aware of paranorm=
al investigations and such this forum is not meant for such discussion and =
research. This place is for the many facets of ITC research, which happens =
to include EVP. If you would like to share some of your files or EVP captur=
es that would be great but please keep the PI talk amongst yourselves.

Reg=
ards,

Frank R.

I agree, especially if you don'=
t take proper measures to seclude the
spirit / demon to a specific location=
, whether it be by a pentagram or
blessed water. I know a guy who left a po=
rtal open for over a month -
no preparations taken or anything - and his ho=
use is one of the most
clearly haunted that I've ever been to. I must say, =
I think it's a
poor decision even if the proper measurements are taken.
