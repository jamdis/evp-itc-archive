The problem i&#39;ve been \nfighting with is at what speed to set it at when it&#39;s automatic to \nhave people not say it&#39;s just a radio DJ or part of a song.  I know \nthe files are fast and are very fragmented, but there is no way to \nsay it is the radio because of the speed.  You are correct in saying \nthat it could be mistaken for words that our minds make up \nthemselves.  I just post what i think i hear.  If i send it to 10 \npeople they probably would hear 10 different things or nothing at \nall.  That&#39;s the problem with any EVP, if you listen to the files \nenough no matter how you record them, you may think you hear one \nthing and convince yourself of it.  While doubters will always say \nyou are nuts for hearing that.  There are no EVP experts \nunfortunately to sift through all our files and decipher them for \nus, so we just have to post what we have and let the general public \ncome up with there own answers.  I will try and slow it down a bit \nand see if that does make a difference.  I never really thought to \ndo that, but now that you suggested it, it seems like a good idea to \ngo that direction next.  I think your manual sweep files are great \ncaptures, but there is really no right and wrong way to do EVP&#39;s in \nthis experimental work.  It&#39;s whatever you have the best outcome \ndoing i guess and stick with that.\n\n-Steve\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; hi everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been experimenting with the manual FM sweep method for a \ngood \n&gt; two weeks and have gotten some amazing results, but I can&#39;t help \nbut \n&gt; wonder if the manual movement of the dial no matter how consistent \nyou \n&gt; try to make it results in some lagging and getting caught on a \nfull \n&gt; word or phrase that is coming from an actual broadcast. The \nmajority of \n&gt; messages I have been getting are direct answers to questions or a \n&gt; phrase or sentence that is obviously put together by different \nbits and \n&gt; pieces of the FM signals. I would like to know what you think of \nthe \n&gt; manual sweep versus the automatic, I know Steve does his research \nusing \n&gt; the automatic FM sweep box and I have been working with the manual \n&gt; method. When I listen to Steve&#39;s captures they seem to be very \nfast and \n&gt; that to me makes it harder to understand and gives the opportunity \nfor \n&gt; mistaking the sound of a word. the manual method on the other hand \nis \n&gt; slower and may give the opportunity to catch a broadcast word or \ntwo \n&gt; like I said so the question is which one do you think is more \nreliable ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;"}
