Your response below surprised me.  I&#x27;ve only been a member of this group for a short time, thus may have missed your theory of origin relative to EVPs and ghost box verbalizations.  So, with respect, and only if you don&#x27;t mind taking the time to reply, I ask... what do you think they are, or represent.  If this info is located elsewhere, a mere link to that spot would suffice, too. 

Thanks so much in advance.

&gt;  It&#x27;s stuff like this that makes me want to completely withdraw. I don&#x27;t
&gt; follow the friggin&#x27; Hollywood pack and accept all the Hollywood BS about
&gt; ghosts and haunings, so everyone gets all condescending. Bite me!

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi all. I am wondering, has anyone here ever gotten an entity through the
&gt; &gt;&gt; box who mentions &quot;rules&quot; for speaking to the living, and if so, what were
&gt; &gt;&gt; those rules? I seem to vaguely recall mention of this somewhere, but can&#x27;t
&gt; &gt;&gt; recall where. Wondering if the rules are laws of physics, or laws
&gt; &gt;&gt; enforceable by (insert deity name here).
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Frank, stop reading, because the next part assumes a belief in ghosts.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Well that&#x27;s rude!
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Reason I ask is, I was watching one of the better ghost shows on TV, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; it got me to thinking about how paranormal activity often happens in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; next room, almost never directly (unless it&#x27;s a deceased loved one, or a
&gt; &gt;&gt; residual haunting). Could this be because of those &quot;rules&quot;? Could the reason
&gt; &gt;&gt; entities lie so much have to do with the &quot;rules&quot;?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Thinking out loud here, so just ignore if I&#x27;m not making any sense.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
