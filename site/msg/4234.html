<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, if you&#x27;re still reading, I consider this to be YOUR group.  It&#x27;s 
about YOUR research.

We all know the long hours you have put in unselfishly experimenting with 
the box.  If you leave, I will unsubscribe. There would be no reason for 
me to be here.  I could care less what Chris Moon has to say.  He hasn&#x27;t 
even approached what you&#x27;ve done. Nor do I think he ever will.

So please take a couple days off, go for some long walks, and reconsider. 
You have friends here.

Zack

&gt; After a long discussion, and at times a yelling match with Chris Moon on the phone...I have like zero memory for verbal stuff, basically I think it came down to he said-she said type deal. I could agree with some of what Mr Moon said, but the bottom line is--I don&#x27;t care! I have had enough of these endless pissing contests, one person telling me one thing, someone else telling me something else. I&#x27;m not wise enough to tell who is telling the truth. I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;m not discussing this stuff anymore, I&#x27;m not making boxes anymore. I have absolutely no interest in the so called paranormal. I don&#x27;t sell this shit, I don&#x27;t make any money, all it does eat all my time and piss me off. I&#x27;ll finish this last box I&#x27;m working on, and that&#x27;s it. No more e-mails, no more discussion--I have had it!
&gt;
&gt; Mr Moon said he would be glad to come on the group and answer question--so there ya go, now is your chance. I&#x27;m not going to be the go between, nor will I participate.
