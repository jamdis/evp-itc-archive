Now none of them will get to jealous over another.\nActually the one I have spent the most time with is the Micro Box, \nsince I keep adding more things to it.\nI do fancy the RSH 12-470 though... it&#39;s my favorite... but please \ndon&#39;t tell the others.\nIt&#39;s easy to carry around, has a built in speaker, and does not have \nthat clicking when sweeping.\nAlthough I have not had the opportunity to use any of them as much as \nI&#39;d like, but maybe in the coming year I will have more chances to \ndabble.\nPlus.. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be adding more things to the Micro Box, as long \nas there is still room to stuff components and wires.\n\nHappy Holidays!\n- Mike\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; What a nice assortment of gear.
