Hi Aaron,

That's was a really good test set apart some very realistic views and
potentials.

I noticed the longer it went the clearer the words started typing out. How
long was this session?

 

What if there was a possibility of recording longer and seeing what they or
the allophones may produce?

I know Dr Annabelle Cordoba had to let her radios run for several day and
they started communicating with her.

 

Good test, ty for sharing that.

LK

Alright, I went ahead and practiced some with the Naturally Speaking
Software. You have to go through training before anything is
recognized and you have to read passages on screen. So I went ahead
and started reading everything in a monotone type voice. I tried to
imitate the allophone file from EVPMaker as close as possible. "Or"
showed up many times, and at one point it made me laugh because it
showed up as "or you are a boy toy." Much of this was when I left the
room and let EVPMaker play into the mic. What was interesting was that
I left the room because I was on the phone with my friend that is a
girl. But I don't think the boy toy remark really applied to me. lol.
Here are the results (Sorry it is so much and not formatted very well,
it's just a quick copy and paste job):

there were born or or or or or or or the other or or or or or or or or
or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or that it would or he or
