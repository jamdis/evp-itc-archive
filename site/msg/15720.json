Where I fell down was trying to ask questions and\n&gt; getting BS doomsville junk. I knew it&#39;s a mistake to ask questions, that\n&gt; like opens the door for the dark dorks. I&#39;m going back to just announcing\n&gt; I&#39;m doing an EVP recording, and just record. They know what I&#39;m thinking and\n&gt; what I need to know and who I would like to hear from. Asking questions, at\n&gt; least for me, has always lead to problems. I&#39;m not like others, presumming\n&gt; I&#39;m so smart and know what is talking, and if it&#39;s honest, like most of the\n&gt; box experts out there on the web. You know, the ones doing pod casts, radio\n&gt; shows and proclaiming this that and the other thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
