Been following this unprofessional idiot's items for awhile now. I love how he says that Frank charges thousands of dollars for an original Frank's box. 

This dude is the worst type of con, preying on people who know only enough to be familiar with the term Frank's box. Then again, it always has bothered me when people take shack hacks and charge stupid prices for them on ebay under the Frank's box moniker.

This guy is based out of Nevada I believe, and his group's ethics leave little to be desired. Takes all kinds, I reckon...
