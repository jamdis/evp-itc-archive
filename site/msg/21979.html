Heard your files Mary, Diane, Steve, I am working on a few more,  here are 
a few of the goodies, as it turns out Troy Davis was not guilty,  and he 
says, "God set me free."  He wants me or someone to "call his bar" I  guess 
that's the lawyer.  A few on here are reverse type files, and I  didn't have 
time to pull the flip, but take my word for it, it's all  there.  Like the one 
here says,  "No good those courts"  one side  here showing is "no good" and 
the other side says, "those courts" wish i had  time to place them here in 
full for you guys, but I got lots to do.  Just  enjoy, and know they did 
kill the wrong fells.  btw, one file i didn't get  up yet, says, "my daddy,"  
and I have "a black angel"  sf
