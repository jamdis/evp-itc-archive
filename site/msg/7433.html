<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Victoria,

Frank has no more idea how to &quot;save&quot; the legions of restless dead  
than the rest of us. We&#x27;re trying to establish a clear two-way  
communication with those entities in other realms of life than our  
own. What you use the radio-sweep technology for is your choice, but  
because of the infancy of this research, it is best, in my opinion,  
to approach it without an agenda or preconceived notions.

I&#x27;ve also got to say that this may not be the area of research you  
want to commit to. You say you haven&#x27;t slept well since the 1970s and  
that the Dead bother you. You don&#x27;t sound like you have managed to  
develop a way of dealing with them that leads to less stress on you.  
This is very likely going to add to the stress, not relieve it.

There is inherent beauty in this research, but never come to it  
thinking that it is a panacea for either you or the &quot;dead screaming  
for help.&quot; The reality is is that it&#x27;s a hard, long slog for a few  
short messages. It&#x27;s hours of sessions and reviews--a lot of which is  
very tiring, for reasons that may be natural and &quot;supernatural.&quot;

Frank can&#x27;t &quot;do the world a favor.&quot; He&#x27;s not hiding any big secret to  
life, the universe, and everything. No one here is. And anyone who  
claims otherwise is fooling both you and themselves.

Hard truths, but they need to be said.

Ann

&gt; Well,
&gt; If you actually have something...it is wrong for you to hide it...

&gt; There are crimes to be solved...the dead are screaming for help...
&gt; Sometimes, all forensics needs is a direction...
&gt; Frank...if this is actually your name...jeese...do the world a  
&gt; favor...do the right thing and show us how to help them...if we  
&gt; help the dead...we help thousands of the living.
&gt; But understand what you do...the religious right will hate you.
&gt; It goes against everything &quot;they&quot; say about the human soul.

&gt; &gt; Frank:
&gt; &gt; I think your input is very important, hell you are
&gt; the inventor! As far a people taking what you say to be negative,
&gt; well if they do oh well they will get over it. I personally don&#x27;t
&gt; think there are any experts, which is my opinion for what it is worth
&gt; and I am sure I will catch hell over my statement. I for one can not
&gt; say or confirm who I am talking to, nor will I ever be able to (well
&gt; maybe when I&#x27;m dead) if they are in fact spirits from the other side
&gt; or other life forms from different planets. I do however know that I
&gt; love the communication who ever they are and pretty much have to
&gt; leave it at that. I think this is what makes it so fascinating to
&gt; me, that so much of the communication we receive is unknown in
&gt; origin. You have taught us that we should take this as it comes, and
&gt; not hold too much truth to some of the messages.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You for one designed each an every box
&gt; differently, having its own unique features about them. From white
&gt; noise generators, to random, to lunar, etc.. You adapted them as you
&gt; went, so if anyone has experimented the most in this field, I would
&gt; say it certainly would be you. The never ending days and hours you
&gt; have spent creating these devices truly surpass all of us combined
&gt; time in the research end, so I don&#x27;t think I have to say anymore
&gt; there.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I can only speak for myself, but I feel that your contributions
&gt; are extremely important and are needed. You have helped and touched
&gt; peoples lives many you will probably never know of or meet. It is
&gt; because of your desire and constant dedication with your building of
&gt; perfection that you have allowed us an opportunity to experience what
&gt; you do knowing that there is more out there than just us, in our
&gt; selfish world of our.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hell I&#x27;m calling it a good day when I can turn my TV remote on,
&gt; so I know I certainly count on you for your experiences in obtaining
&gt; the best communication!

&gt; &gt; I was going to make comments about box use, but so far
&gt; it always falls on deaf ears, and gets taken as being negative, so
&gt; screw it, the &quot;experts&quot; can hash it out. What would I know, I just
&gt; make the damn things?! BTW, for the above reasons, not making boxes
&gt; fror anyone. I don&#x27;t care what you want to use it for, or how
&gt; quailified anyone thinks they are.
