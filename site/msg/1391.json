Read past posts to get an idea of \nwhat the group is about, i did and learned a lot of information about \nthis whole topic.\n\nListen to the Uploaded Mp3 files in the FILES section and let us know \nwhat you think of them.  I&#39;m in there under Simple FM Sweep radio \ndesign and would like to get some feedback.  I got some, but would \nlike more.  My radio is a slightly different design than frank&#39;s and \nwant to know what people think.\n\nThanx,\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Laura Kimberley&quot; &lt;gjk1rrfan@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Welcome Zack,\n&gt; Glad your here and look forward to your thoughts, ideas, opinions \n&gt; and experiments!!!\n&gt; Laura\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I just joined and I thought I&#39;d introduce myself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am an electrical engineer, radio amateur and a ghost hunter \n&gt; living in \n&gt; &gt; Urbana, IL. (Well, I like the term &quot;paranormal investigator&quot; \n&gt; better!)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve gotten a lot of EVP&#39;s on a pocket DVR but I found and \n&gt; downloaded the \n&gt; &gt; schematics for Frank&#39;s ghost box some months ago.  I&#39;m fascinated \n&gt; by this \n&gt; &gt; idea and I hope I can find the time to build the equipmeont some \n&gt; time \n&gt; &gt; soon. Hopefully I will get beyond the 70-80 hour work weeks I&#39;ve \n&gt; been \n&gt; &gt; putting in for the last couple months ...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Looking forward to seeing what&#39;s happening on this group!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Zack\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
