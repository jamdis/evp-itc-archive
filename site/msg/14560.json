Sorry but it happens to all of us. I think sometimes when we reply to a message they have a long &quot;history&quot; of other posts and it blocks them. Sort of like a chain letter. Good rule of thumb is remove everything in the section below except the part you are replying to. That usually solves the problem.\n\nMisty\n--- On Thu, 5/21/09, Kristin &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; wrote:\n\nThis is the third time I have tried to send this message... errr ..
