No, I don't think I am being =
too critical, but I may have expectations that are a little too high. =C2=
=A0I want to take my time with this. =C2=A0For my own understanding, I need=
 to have a large sample size so I know not only what to expect to see, but =
what to look for. =C2=A0I have seen ITC snapshots from programs like this t=
hat offer full faces. =C2=A0I would be more inclined to believe in such an =
image as opposed to, lets say. two dark lines that may or may not be eyebro=
ws. 


Even in your example of the towel, you get half a face. =C2=A0If you=
 have half a face (on the vertical plane, not the horizontal) you can extra=
polate out what the entire face would look like. =C2=A0This is something I =
would like to get myself and I would consider that evidence if it showed up=
 in one of these programs. =C2=A0But, if you have something that looks like=
 a forehead and that is all there is, then it could also look like a rock o=
r some other such object.


I am certainly hoping for results worked into b=
ox sessions. =C2=A0Directing a session with intent, like saying "I am going=
 to examine the sound waves of this communication in hopes of seeing your f=
ace. =C2=A0Is it possible you can show your face to me now through sound? "=
 is what I am after. =C2=A0If a positive hit like this happens, then I will=
 be jumping for joy. =C2=A0Another good example would be a name, lets say T=
om, that occurs. =C2=A0If you get a positive affirmation that the name you =
heard is present, then you try the same technique only you address Tom by n=
ame and get a face, that would be even better.


But, as it stands now, the=
 faces as they appear are random at best. =C2=A0I would be more inclined to=
 believe that when these faces do occur , they are going to occur with a le=
sser frequency than multiple images in a few seconds of audio like Ursula's=
 example. =C2=A0If this where the case, there would be dozens, and possibly=
 hundreds, of faces during a ten minute session and I just don't think that=
 is possible. =C2=A0This is why I need to look at several samples to find o=
ut if this is the case or not. =C2=A0If these partialized faces occur in mu=
ltiples all the time, I would be more apt to discount it. =C2=A0But, if the=
y are a rarity affixed to only a few clips out of dozens, I would be more i=
nclined to believe in them. =C2=A0Sample size is everything. =C2=A0It is li=
ke listening to GBC. =C2=A0If you have never done a session before, you wou=
ld be inclined to believe every stray radio signal is a communication. =C2=
=A0Only by continued practice (expanding your sample size) can you start to=

 rule out stray radio with any degree of accuracy. =C2=A0


On the other h=
and, I am very new to this and I could certainly be wrong. =C2=A0I will con=
tinue to plug sound into the programs and hope for the best. =C2=A0


I rea=
lly want this to work. =C2=A0As you have probably experienced, when they wa=
nt you to hear something or know something, they make it very obvious while=
 communicating. =C2=A0I am hoping they apply this same rigor to this new fo=
rmat to show us that they are there. =C2=A0If they can, then the world of v=
ideo and audio ITC will merge in one source and then the skeptics be damned=
!

<DIV>I too have been aware of t=
his at Keith's site for long, long time, but like I said in the last post, =
I am very new to this as in doing it on my own computer.  Just like yo=
u.  So don't act like you know what I do and do not know, thank you ve=
ry much.  </DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>I am not attacking you so back t=
he hell off.  I made it clear that this was for my own own edification=
, for me to accept my own images.  </DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Th=
e image I ever so briefly mentioned the one posted that had several "Faces"=
 or pieces thereof that were circled.  As for your image of the man pe=
eking out, I saw nothing there.  Period.   Did I say previou=
sly what I thought about the quality of the images in that photo?  No.=
  I politely kept it to myself because I do not like to differ with pe=
ople or to deflate hot air balloons.  But there you have it, that is w=
hat I saw.  And to my knowledge, that is the only time I have describe=
d what I have seen thus far in your images other than mentioning the word "=
eyebrows."  In the one that had many circles, I saw one that looked li=
ke a set of lips and a chin and the rest I personally thought was matrixing=
.  Once again, did I saw this?  No.  But you asked for it so=
 there it is.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>The whole point of my post, had yo=
u read it with a clear head.  It was all about my own edification, tha=
t I, and I alone, need to keep plugging in files before I, and I alone, mak=
e a judgement about MY images and whether they are real or not based upon t=
he images they provide in contrast to the bulk of other files.  If you=
 simply compare your one image with the many circles to the youtube file, I=
 suspect I am correct in saying that faces occur with much more rarity than=
 your circle file and that they can appear fully formed.  Once again, =
I suspect, only, and I will only be able to tell after time.  Sample s=
ize is everything, and I thought I made that abundantly clear.  The po=
st was simply about my process of learning rather than running out and sayi=
ng look what I found when I simply don't know what has been found yet becau=
se it is the first time I have played with the controls rather than seeing =
the end snapshots on another
 persons website.  </DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>=

<DIV>Why do you always jump on the defensive and attack every one who does=
 not fall in line with you?  Not everything has to be fight or flight,=
 Ursula, and not every bridge has to be burned so thoroughly to the ground.=
  This is not an attack on you or results, reread the post, and this t=
ime thinking a little more clearly about what is written on the page and no=
t your own emotional backlash construing things in the posted text that are=
 simply not there.  Had you done this, you would have seen the point o=
f my post was not an attack on you, in ANY way.    </DIV>

<DIV>No,=
 I don't think I am being too critical, but I may have expectations that ar=
e a little too high.  I want to take my time with this.  For my o=
wn understanding, I need to have a large sample size so I know not only wha=
t to expect to see, but what to look for.  I have seen ITC snapshots f=
rom programs like this that offer full faces.  I would be more incline=
d to believe in such an image as opposed to, lets say. two dark lines that =
may or may not be eyebrows. 
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Even in your example of t=
he towel, you get half a face.  If you have half a face (on the vertic=
al plane, not the horizontal) you can extrapolate out what the entire face =
would look like.  This is something I would like to get myself and I w=
ould consider that evidence if it showed up in one of these programs.  =
;But, if you have something that looks like a forehead and that is all ther=
e is, then it could also look like a rock or some other such object.</DIV>
=
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>I am certainly hoping for results worked into box sess=
ions.  Directing a session with intent, like saying "I am going to exa=
mine the sound waves of this communication in hopes of seeing your face. &n=
bsp;Is it possible you can show your face to me now through sound? " is wha=
t I am after.  If a positive hit like this happens, then I will be jum=
ping for joy.  Another good example would be a name, lets say Tom, tha=
t occurs.  If you get a positive affirmation that the name you heard i=
s present, then you try the same technique only you address Tom by name and=
 get a face, that would be even better.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>But, as =
it stands now, the faces as they appear are random at best.  I would b=
e more inclined to believe that when these faces do occur , they are going =
to occur with a lesser frequency than multiple images in a few seconds of a=
udio like Ursula's example.  If this where the case, there would be do=
zens, and possibly hundreds, of faces during a ten minute session and I jus=
t don't think that is possible.  This is why I need to look at several=
 samples to find out if this is the case or not.  If these partialized=
 faces occur in multiples all the time, I would be more apt to discount it.=
  But, if they are a rarity affixed to only a few clips out of dozens,=
 I would be more inclined to believe in them.  Sample size is everythi=
ng.  It is like listening to GBC.  If you have never done a sessi=
on before, you would be inclined to believe every stray radio signal is a c=
ommunication.  Only by continued practice
 (expanding your sample size=
) can you start to rule out stray radio with any degree of accuracy.  =
</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>On the other hand, I am very new to this and I =
could certainly be wrong.  I will continue to plug sound into the prog=
rams and hope for the best.  </DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>I really want=
 this to work.  As you have probably experienced, when they want you t=
o hear something or know something, they make it very obvious while communi=
cating.  I am hoping they apply this same rigor to this new format to =
show us that they are there.  If they can, then the world of video and=
 audio ITC will merge in one source and then the skeptics be damned!</DIV>

<DIV>I saw a couple which could be construed as images in the one series y=
