<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello Tammi,

I am very sorry this has happened to you and your family.  I pray for 
the safe return of her, but if that is not possible I hope for a 
recovery so there is closure.
I also hope someone in our group is able to help locate an area to 
search.  I&#x27;m sure there are some in the group who are already working 
on your request.
We have many here who have been very successful at contacting those 
who may be able to help, using the numerous devices available.

I&#x27;m sure those involved will contact you if an answer is found.
Again, I pray for things to work out, you are in all our prayers.

- Mike Coletta
