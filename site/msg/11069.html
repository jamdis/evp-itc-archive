I use clear voice denoiser and the p1 filter works well for fan as well as water. I never did really care for the denoiser parts of other software it gave me headaches LOL

that he have everything turned off and he said he did. However, he

of a fan running. I just started using Gold Wave. Does anyone - without 
getting to technical - know how to remove the fan?

Any help would be appreciated.
