<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m still wondering how this list went from a group of highly  
researchers all using Frank&#x27;s boxes, mini&#x27;s etc., and getting amazing  
results, so people who don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s real and have never used  
one.

And it&#x27;s Frank&#x27;s original group on top of it all.

Sigh.

&gt; I believe I have recorded spirits, however I have never used

&gt; so I cannot comment on it.
&gt; I will record anywhere, anytime and I have recorded some excellent  
&gt; results.

&gt; &gt; But, are there any files on this group where any of you believe you
&gt; &gt; are communicating with a spirit? Frank&#x27;s box seems to really force
&gt; &gt; all kinds of &quot;voices&quot; out of the airwaves and I am not yet buying  
&gt; it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does any one have anything constructive to say to us in regard to
&gt; &gt; actual paranormal investigation via Frank&#x27;s box, rather than mildly
&gt; &gt; entertaining techno-tweaking?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was on a multi-group investigation at an old historical mission in
&gt; &gt; Santa Barbara a week ago, for instance and watched the frank&#x27;s  
&gt; box at
&gt; &gt; work for the first time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sure, I heard a few things that sounded obviously like radio, but we
&gt; &gt; did hear a very eerie woman&#x27;s voice screaming when we were in the  
&gt; main
&gt; &gt; chapel room, and THAT got my attention.. But everything else I have
&gt; &gt; heard so far in the files here is not striking me as the voice of  
&gt; any
&gt; &gt; apparition, due to the weakness of quality.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you&#x27;re still reading this, I have to tell you I have had striking
&gt; &gt; results in my own home, simply letting a recording device roll,  
&gt; and if
&gt; &gt; you&#x27;re not yet interested in hearing these samples, I guess you&#x27;re
&gt; &gt; more into the box than the afterlife and that&#x27;s YOU, not me! :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; LOVE,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Katherine.
