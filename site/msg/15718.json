I have been a Self proclaimed expert in the field of EVP for well over 20 years with 1000&#39;s of class &quot;A&quot; EVP&#39;s. I am fairly new to ITC only been researching the idea and have done a few experiments.\n\nI would like your opinions on the following picture I took recently when I started using webcams to obtain photographic images of spirit. This is my first pic and I am seeing (circled in yellow) on the left, a lady&#39;s face from just above the nose to the top of her head. I see, nose, eyes, eye-brows, forehead, and hair that is parted in the middle. On the right I see someone else only I see eyes, bridge of nose, and forehead. I was hoping to catch a picture of my mother in spirit as she just past June 12 and a friend of mine who just past 2 weeks ago. The lady on the left doesn&#39;t look like my mom but the pic on the right does have a slight resemblance to my friend.\n\nI have uploaded a pic of my friend for comparison. What do all of you see? I have uploaded these into my folder in the file section &quot;AFF1NY&#39;s FOLDER&quot;\n\nI have gotten a few EVP&#39;s from Mom and My friend using the ghost box and the EVPmaker with Speakjet Allophones, but these are not quite class &quot;A&quot; EVP&#39;s. I only keep the Class &quot;A&quot;s because to me, they are PROOF of life on the otherside.\n\nThanks for taking the time to look and I am looking forward to your opinions."}
