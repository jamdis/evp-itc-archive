Two examples, a house in another part of town was burning, she dreamt it, woke up and sent the farmhands to it to help put it out... another instance, the oxen were stuck in the mud in a field so she sent more people to help extricate them.  Again, if all I was told was true, then again it would definitely show how mind has power over matter.  I&#39;m not afraid to recount things like this that I&#39;ve heard, though I know it does open me up to ridicule.  I try to remind myself that, like you said, many were ridiculed in their time, and turned out to be, not crazy, but rather ahead of their time.\n\nAnd Like Frank said in another post, powers that be have reasons to keep knowledge like this hidden.  Who would listen to earthly authority anymore if people knew for sure there was a higher authority, and knew just how much power we each individually wield? :)\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jennifer&quot; &lt;3eyesofwisdom@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been silent out of fear. Sometimes the ridicule gets hard to take. I know that sometimes mind does influence perception of reality. The other day I was brought back to quantum physics. They talk of an observer and how just the observer being there can change things. I was thinking it is like when I sing. I sing much better when I am alone than when I think someone can hear me. \n&gt;      This goes into old teachings. the &quot;As above , so below.&quot; A lot of people seem to believe humans are the only thing that feel and think. I do not believe this, as I have witnessed strange occurrences.\n&gt; We should be having someone over to bless our house soon. The energy needs cleansed and I feel too drained to attempt it.\n&gt;      I am very interested in one of the things posted. It was about Global consciousness project. Someone had posted about an experience where they were told by device about a wreck around the corner, or something like that. I wonder if their subconscious picked up on it and it manifested on their device. I know it could be other things as well. As humans it is often us putting limits on what is possible that keeps us from our full potential. At least thats my thoughts at this time.\n&gt;    And don&#39;t give up just because others may not believe. In my invention books I have found  a lot of times it is those who are called crazy and mocked that actually progress things. Recently I read that Marconi was put in an asylum for telling them about the technology we use today. \n&gt;      I have many thoughts. If I am to make a ghost box with the radio I have I am probably going to need help. I didn&#39;t make it far in my electronics course before getting ill. I want to read more throughout the site and others to see if I can do it without bothering anyone.\n&gt;     I know I kind of come and go. I hope you don&#39;t mind. Everyone has always called me a free spirit. I tend to just go wherever my heart takes me.\n&gt;"}
