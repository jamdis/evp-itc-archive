I would like to be friends. I have made a hack a couple years ago and really enjoy using it. I have eventually picked up a &#39;guide&#39; with the box. I have had the opportunity to work with Rosemary Guiley and use the box that Frank had made for her. I can&#39;t say enough good things about the box. I have noticed also that while using the box, I pick up many evp over top of the frequencies. Has anyone else noticed this phenomena? Thanks for your time. If you would like to friend request or know Frank&#39;s page should he have one, leave a note with your request. Thank you everybody.\n\nMick\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/micksghosts"}
