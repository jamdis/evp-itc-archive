I would love to see your results.  I&#39;m just \nweighing the idea of getting one.  My concern is that there is only an antenna.  There is no \nemf sensor or thermometer set up with it (like the ovilus) so my guess is it&#39;s just turning \nstray signals (whatever that might be) into words.  Not sure that&#39;s the greatest method of \ncommunication.  Just my random thoughts.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;eastern_paranormal&quot; &lt;eparanormal@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have both. I am still out on them both.
