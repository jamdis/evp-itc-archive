I just finished Part 1 of 3. Last night I \nstarted on Part 2, and wanted to share a couple photos of how I&#39;m \nattempting to measure the imprinted energy in the plane crash debris.\nI&#39;ve placed a coule of pics of the device with the debris on the \nfollowing link:\n\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com/prototypes/prototypespage19.htm\n\nThe picture on top, with the four pieces of debris on the small card is \nan example of what I sent out to 8 other ITC researchers so they could \ndo their research on the debris.\nThe picture on the bottom is of much more of the debris in a glass \ncontainer.\n\nJust thought I&#39;d share a bit, so you can see what&#39;s happening before I \nrelease my final findings.\n\nHave a wonderful Holiday, all...\n- Mike C.
