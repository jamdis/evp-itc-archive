<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank,

was your comment related to my thoughts on a formant synthesis device for spirit communication?

Of course it will be an electronic device; I had mentioned the mechanical machines only for illustration purposes. :)

&gt;  There is a way to add in the foundation sound in the electronics. In 
&gt; #4 I had a square wave generator with variable frequency, that sound 
&gt; was mixed in with the radio audio and seemed to produce 
&gt; louder/longer/clearer voices. I put this function in #24, and 24 
&gt; works the best out of the systems that used the LA1816 chip for a 
&gt; radio. I don&#x27;t get that much time to play actually use this stuff.
&gt;  
&gt;  A square wave is preferred because the output contains all 
&gt; harmonics. The circuits are simple, and can easily be made on 
&gt; breadboard, or perf board from Radio shack. The mixer is a very 
&gt; simple circuit as well, or sound mixers can be purchased. 
&gt; 
&gt;  It was with these boxes, and one that I had tried to use a shield on 
&gt; thre tuner module, creating RF interference, that produced the 
&gt; clearest, and longest messages. 
&gt; 
&gt;  I suggest people really interested in advancing the research go get 
&gt; a book on basic electronics instead of constantly trying to re-invent 
&gt; the wheel. I&#x27;m not saying mechanical methods are a &quot;re-invention&quot;, 
&gt; you just have to have a way to interface it to spirit, and I think 
&gt; that takes electricity/electronics.
