 Well that was a bust, sending a voice to a site in the UK that claims t=
o be scientific, and been investigating since the 80s. I sent the "What She=
 Said" voice, and they can't hear it, so it's not valid. We all know how su=
bjective these voices are, not everyone can hear them, and most don't hear =
the same thing. I think this is just another way of debunking, claiming to =
be scientific, but not being open enough to allow one the hear anything. I =
did tell them about rooms of people hearing the voices, but that seems to h=
ave been ignored, as well as the TAPS article. It was interesting that they=
 are in Europe (UK) and heard the voice as German sounding, but I guess tha=
t doesn't count for anything either.
