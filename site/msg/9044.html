  You have some great files. And I totally agree about learning to hear the responses. I haven't had to many changes to use my radio yet (at least without interruption) I think when I start recording my session and play them back, I will be surprised at what I missed in live time.

  Hi Kay. How wonderful you have decided to explore this path. It's an adventure, for sure! 
Half the battle (at least) with sweep is learning to hear the responses. That takes practice, 
so whenever you feel ready, jump right in. Each and every person doing this type of 
research started from the beginning, knowing nothing. 

I started with traditional EVP, recording in silence. Then I began to explore various 
backgrounds and different types of hardware/software combinations. From there, I got 
into manual radio sweep and worked with that for quite some time before trying any of 
the shack hacks. Eventually, I got a MiniBox. Most recently, I began experimenting with 
Stefan Bion's EVP Maker and the SpeakJet Allophones file he created. 

I like variety! I recommend people to try it all. ;-)
