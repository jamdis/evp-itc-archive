<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Steve, I&#x27;ve known Frank for about 4 years and I consider him a  
friend. He knows I stand behind him. I did before there were boxes  
and I will after there are boxes. I did EVP research for years--I got  
my first reel-to-reel from Sarah Estep&#x27;s late husband if that dates  
me at all. So please don&#x27;t mistake my good natured teasing of Frank  
for making demands on him. I know perfectly well that whatever  
happens will happen--or not--and I am perfectly at peace with that.

&gt; I personally think begging for a box from Frank is probably just
&gt; pissing him off. He will give a box to whom he feels is doing
&gt; research on their own and deserves one being they already have a
&gt; clientel on the other side without his help. This is just my
&gt; opinion and i really don&#x27;t mean to offend people, but everybody can
&gt; try to say the right thing to persuade Frank, but he is looking for
&gt; true researchers in ITC and not someone who just wants to have what
&gt; nobody can make themself. It&#x27;s just annoying seeing people everyday
&gt; saying where&#x27;s my box? There is plenty of research to do without it
&gt; and capable people to build them too. Find them and stop begging on
&gt; this board, this is not what it is for and i&#x27;m not speaking for
&gt; Frank in any way. But i&#x27;d rather hear someone&#x27;s Manual sweeps or
&gt; something through EVP maker rather than groveling with no attempt to
&gt; do anything for themselves. Just my take on it and i&#x27;m sorry if i
&gt; pissed anybody off.

&gt; &gt; Give one to Bruce before me, Frank. He&#x27;s a great guy and he
&gt; deserves
&gt; &gt; it a lot more; he&#x27;s got more time for research and a lot of
&gt; friends
&gt; &gt; on the others side he wants and needs to talk to.

&gt; &gt; &gt; hey Frank,
&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks for the reply to my post. I am disabled from toxins I
&gt; breathed
&gt; &gt; &gt; at ground zero during rescue and recovery efforts, I was a first
&gt; &gt; &gt; responder so we got the worst of it and it has left me with a
&gt; lung
&gt; &gt; &gt; disease and two heart attacks but I&#x27;m not handicaped I have total
&gt; &gt; &gt; mobility I just have to take it easy. So as you may see I have
&gt; alot of
&gt; &gt; &gt; time for experimenting and have been doing evp research as well
&gt; as itc
&gt; &gt; &gt; for some time now and your box has touched a special cord with
&gt; me it
&gt; &gt; &gt; just feels like I should have and be using one. Don&#x27;t ask me to
&gt; &gt; &gt; explain
&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#x27;s just this wierd feeling like something is telling me you
&gt; are
&gt; &gt; &gt; meant
&gt; &gt; &gt; to use this tool. If you can ever see your way clear as to
&gt; building
&gt; &gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; for me I would be more than glad to pay for your time labor and
&gt; &gt; &gt; materials and would be forever appreciative.
