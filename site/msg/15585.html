As Debbie said, " You either believe it or you don't....... .."

These peop=

addressing those who have either decided that this is all impossible, or th=
at this is all beyond question.=A0 I am only speaking to those with open mi=
nds as regarding what is proven and what is not, who can move around in the=
ir stance, who can question their beliefs, and who are willing to listen to=
 theories from all over the spectrum of evidence, science, theory, practice=
, and even belief.=A0 I am not really hopeful that those who either "believ=
e or don't" will find my points useful.

If I can't hear the voices Frank (=
or if I hear them different), that does not mean it is not real.=A0 If no o=
ne else, in an objective testing situation, can hear what you hear without =
being told what it is first, that may not make it real or fake, but it does=
 suggest some interesting further testing is justified.=A0 

But again, not=

The fact is, the boxes and related devices work, and=
