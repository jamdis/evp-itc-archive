<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Received and held my first session with Joe&#x27;s Box yesterday, and 
thought it might be good to see what you guys think of what I got. I 
will upload them in a minute under Ursula- Joe&#x27;s Box. 

The two clips are actually from the second session, which I did about 
five minutes after the first, uneventful one.

Both clips are from the same session.

The first clip is from the beginnng of the four-minute session.  I 
have just asked, &quot;Is there something you want to say?&quot; and then 
before and while I repeat the question, a voice says, &quot;-the fuck up.  
Shut the--&quot;

The second clip happens later.  I had asked &quot;What is my name?&quot; and 
the earlier (&quot;shutthefuckup&quot;) smart-alecky voice had answered &quot;Ursula 
Anne&quot; in a singsong way (This is a little weird because my real name 
is Anne Ursula, so kids used to tease me by calling me Ursula Anne at 
school after I started going by my middle name at age 11.) 

The second clip starts immediately after, when the same voice 
says, &quot;Zip It!&quot;
Then, a second voice says, &quot;Shhh. Listen, you&#x27;ll scare her.&quot; 
Then the first voice says, &quot;Aww!&quot;  Then something I can&#x27;t make out in 
short bursts.
Then, I say &quot;I&#x27;m listening&quot; because I heard &quot;Listen&quot; from the second 
voice.
After my voice you hear &quot;Here you go!&quot; and then &quot;What&#x27;s Up?!&quot; from 
that second voice again.

I&#x27;m full of wonder about this box.  It was odd. People say the boxes 
FEEL different from anything else, and I really did.  I KNEW somehow 
when I started that second session that there would be something, and 
it was like the language opened itself up to me.  It&#x27;s a very 
different sounding sort of thing from anything else.  I can&#x27;t really 
describe it.  It&#x27;s much, much different from anything I&#x27;ve done 
before and quite Awe-some in a literal sense.

I was also very surprised that I wasn&#x27;t at all afraid of whatever 
idiot was swearing and saying stupid things.  Like a bully on a 
playground, really.  Nothing scarier than that.  

Thanks, Steve, for giving me the chance to experience this tool.  And 
thanks, Frank, dear Frank who I&#x27;ve never met, for having the box idea 
in the first place.
