I&#39;m at http://www.ITCdeadpeople.com\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a super simple site. Just five pages. But page one has a link to some\n&gt; of my EVP which I \n&gt; posted on putfile. And page two has several links: one for instructions on\n&gt; the water video \n&gt; ITC technique, one to a Maury segment on youtube where some of my material\n&gt; was used \n&gt; (thanks for posting that, Debbie!), and a couple collages of the crystal\n&gt; images.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope you like it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt; , Wiliam\n&gt; Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Margaret, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What is you sites address? Just wanting to check it out\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rees\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Misty. I was surprised at how much smaller my files became when I\n&gt; changed \n&gt; my \n&gt; &gt; settings in Audacity to 16-bit MONO with an 11025Hz sample rate. I figure\n&gt; this is voice \n&gt; &gt; we are recording, not the symphony. And in my case, I&#39;m not doing any kind\n&gt; of \n&gt; frequency \n&gt; &gt; analysis, or anything else that requires super high quality files. Files,\n&gt; in almost all cases, \n&gt; &gt; really do not need to be 32-bit stereo with a 44100Hz sample rate. But I\n&gt; know how \n&gt; hard \n&gt; &gt; it can be to convince some people of this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I do save my individual raw files on my drive in WAV format. But if I&#39;m\n&gt; going to post, I \n&gt; &gt; create an MP3. Even my WAV files are small though. Just took a look, and\n&gt; with my \n&gt; &gt; settings, a short WAV file runs about 88kb. Converted to MP3 it becomes\n&gt; just 16kb. I \n&gt; &gt; have one that is 248kb in the raw, but after editing out unrelated content\n&gt; and exporting \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; MP3, it was just 24kb. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If people would just record with the lower settings to begin with, I think\n&gt; they would be \n&gt; &gt; surprised at the amount of quality which remains... not to discount how\n&gt; much of their \n&gt; own \n&gt; &gt; hard drive space will be saved. I know a 1MB WAV file with the high\n&gt; settings becomes \n&gt; just \n&gt; &gt; 20kb in MP3 format with the lower settings. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I visit another forum where the max file size for a single submission is\n&gt; 150kb. A person \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; physically unable to upload any file larger than that. People have changed\n&gt; to the lower \n&gt; &gt; settings in order to meet the file size restriction, and I can tell you\n&gt; that plenty of \n&gt; members \n&gt; &gt; post, and plenty of others hear and understand their examples just fine.\n&gt; Hopefully some \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; the members here will give the lower settings a try. :0)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Margaret\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt; , Misty\n&gt; Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You guys really do have to start using mp3 versions tho we are at 90%\n&gt; full again so its \n&gt; &gt; going to come down to either some people wont be allowed to post files if\n&gt; they cant \n&gt; make \n&gt; &gt; the transition, or all files will have to be deleted, or nobody will be\n&gt; able to post at all \n&gt; &gt; because there will be no space left. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Looking for last minute shopping deals?
