<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Everyone,

I&#x27;m new to &quot;EVP-ITC&quot; but I hope to learn a lot from you active folks.
I have been reading forums from several paranormal websites and
comparing experiences and theories from their more observant members.
I hope to apply my background in electronics to improving spirit
communications.

I was making a very slow start with a magnetic field generator to use
the field to pickup cross modulation from spirits and monitor that
with a magnetic loop receiver. I am slow at acomplishing my goals and
got distracted by reports of Frank Sumption&#x27;s radio scanning
breakthroughs. They have come about by his energetic development
efforts and hours at the workbench.

Well, I&#x27;ve settled on a construction project of a simple VHF receiver
that can be adjusted to tune the FM broadcast band or the AM aircraft
band that has airport pilot chatter. I plan to include a voltage
tuning diode that can be scanned with the ramp voltage from an free
running LTC555 timer IC. The whole thing should be inexpensive to
duplicate and hopefully allow spirit message retrival from these
bands. I will certainly post the results here as they come in.

I&#x27;ve assembled two Olympus c-2040 zoom cameras to take stereoscopic
photos with infrared filters. 

I&#x27;ve designed an infrared sensitive thermistor circuit with a visible
LED indicator that will light if incident heat is blocked by a heat
absorbing mass. The sensors are to be arranged in a styrofoam panel to
outline shadow shapes cast on its surface. I have an infrared shop
heater to radiate toward the sensor matrix panel.

I&#x27;ll try to concentrate on the radio project and get it working!

More later,

Joe</pre>
