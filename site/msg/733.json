So....... I left a \nnote on the &quot;opinion&quot; page, where veiwers can leave feedback about shows. I \ncouldn&#39;t find a regular e-mail contact on the show site, I used the opinion \npage to tell about my boxes. So far, very few have taken my work seriously, \nif at all, as if they &quot;know better&quot;, so I&#39;m not expecting any follow up, but \nya never know.\n\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFREE online classifieds from Windows Live Expo ��� buy and sell with people \nyou know \nhttp://clk.atdmt.com/MSN/go/msnnkwex0010000001msn/direct/01/?href=http://expo.live.com?s_cid=Hotmail_tagline_12/06"}
