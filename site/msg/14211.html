Yep thats what=A0I saw too thats why I said I'd have to question more becau=
se what the trooper told me doesnt quite make sense to me compared to what =
I found online. Maybe Aprils right I dont know until I ask. Maybe just a ni=
ce way of asking over the airwaves.
=A0
Out of service =3D dead perhaps wit=
hout spreading false alarm to anyone whos listening. I have no clue. Will l=
et ya know later why he said that.

True - except there are other c=
odes for fatalities, accidents, and trauma.
Code 7 means things like home, =
on personal time, in court, etc.

Code 7 is either code for being out of service (short for =
10-7), or a meal break:

Tonight at work=
 I was talking to a state trooper, there had been an accident. I asked him =
if there were any deaths (it was very very bad) and he said he didnt know s=
o he got on his radio and called in and asked them if it was a 7 at the sit=
e. They told him negative, and he told me the little boy who was the worst =
off was still alive. I asked him why did you ask them if it was a 7. He sai=
d code 7, I was asking them if they were dead. So if you ever hear anyone c=
all 7 over the radio that means someones dead.
=A0
Just thought I would pas=

fore when used to describe who is speaking rather than a name they say seve=
n.
