<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Nathan.  I always look to relevance as a key in determining whether or not something is 
appropriate to the session.  If this were a hoax, I would then have to seek an explanation 
for how private information is known by the &#x27;hoax perp&#x27;, particularly information that 
would require visual awareness.  

Some of us have examples of appropriate responses being given when asking things like, 
&quot;Can you name something nearby me?&quot; or &quot;Please tell me what I&#x27;m holding in my left 
hand.&quot;  A sophisticated multi-transmission two way radio would not explain answers 
which require &#x27;visual&#x27; information of some kind (though I&#x27;ll be the first to admit my 
understanding of electronics is limited but I&#x27;m fairly confident on this aspect.) 

Of course, there is always the chance that the person running the hoax is also, or in 
partnership with, an extremely talented remote viewer or psychic who is able to glean that 
visual information from the ether or the mind of the experimenter.  

And what of those examples where people have confirmed the sound of the voice being 
&quot;just like&quot; that of their loved one in spirit?  Surely the hoaxer isn&#x27;t also able to mimic 
people&#x27;s loved ones.

If you are using EVP Maker with anything other than the allophones file, which contains no 
words to begin with, you are also running the possibility of &#x27;false positives&#x27; albeit they 
wouldn&#x27;t be from a hoax.  Again, I look to relevance to be key, and relevant info that 
would not come easily to a stranger is even better.  

For example, I turned on my MiniBox for the very first time and said, &quot;Hello?&quot; and 
immediately received the response, &quot;Hello Margaret.&quot;  If this were a hoax, how could that 
person know in less than 10 seconds, who I was by name.  I had not given this information 
out.  Not to mention that you have people experimenting 24/7 and receiving similar 
responses.  How in the world could an organization have the manpower, technology, or 
even the desire, to attempt such a hoax?  I mean that as a genuine inquiry, because there 
might be an explanation I have not thought of.  

I have one example where, via radio sweep, my communicator was able to correctly 
identify the status and location of a missing person (who it turns out was alive and well, so 
we ended up with confirmation that the info given had indeed been correct - which is 
much less complicated that trying to track and understand the clues when associated with 
the dead, or missing but not found.)  Again, if a hoax, would that have simply been a 
lucky guess on the part of the hoaxer?

Bottom line for me is ... have I wondered if it could be a hoax?  Or simply a fortuitous 
tuning of the dial?  Yes, on both accounts.  But there is enough compelling evidence to rule 
out both of them as an explanation for the far too many relevant examples received by so 
many of us.

Good food for thought, but after digesting it, I&#x27;d have to say, &quot;No, a sophisticated hoax 
does not sufficiently explain the phenomena on a large scale.&quot;

&gt; you heard?
&gt; 
&gt; This whole radio and spirit voices, could be a MASSIVE
&gt; HOAX, perpetuated by some one with a sophisticated
&gt; multi-transmission two way radio.
&gt; 
&gt; Think about it.
&gt; 
&gt; THAT IS WHY I USE EVPmaker only to commuincate with
&gt; the other dimension.
