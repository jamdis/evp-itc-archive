Another nice feature is that you can use either a highpass or  \nlowpass filter (sometimes that is all that is needed) and changing the PITCH  is \na very handy tool. Always KEEP an original copy of your recordings. I just  \nsave a copy from inside audacity (to desktop or somewhere) then I will star\nt  my work on trying to clear it up. Save the original (and proceeding \nenhanced  version(s) by using the &quot;file&quot; button at to left corner oif program. \nThere you  would SAVE &quot;selection&quot; as MP3.(To upload to here) or save to WAV \n(is bigger)  but higher qulity. Can always convert the wav to mp3 from withing \naudacity  also. *you will need to get the mps &quot;pluging&quot; from the website, \nand follow the  information to install it &quot;manually&quot; (once is only needed) \nthat way you get  the mp3 converter program free. But really...Audacity is a \npretty good program  to have round. Has a nice &quot;undo&quot; fesature too, if you \nmake a mistake.

In the \n&gt; &quot;tomorr\n&gt; &gt; sure that it is a  voice.

I can&#39;t make out any clear words. Sure-I could \nprobably \n&gt; &gt; matrix  some in, but that is all it would be.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For an EVP to  be considered proof positive of spirit communication by \n&gt; the \n&gt;  &gt; community at large, it has to be clear enough that many people hear \nthe  \n&gt; &gt; same thing, without hints or coaxing. If you have to have high  quality \n&gt; devices \n&gt; &gt; to make it out, it just isn&#39;t good  enough.

Even so,  if I am trying to \n&gt; &gt; remain unbiased and objective, there is no way  for me to say this is a \n&gt; spirit, \n&gt; &gt; without personally  being with you when you caught it.

You have to understand that \nwith \n&gt; &gt; just these recordings alone,  there is no way to scientifically prove \n&gt; what \n&gt; &gt; you have  recorded is spirit communication. If you could get \nconsistent, \n&gt; &gt;  intelligent question and answer recordings, then you would be alot \n&gt;  closer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here again, we are back to the &quot;So what?&quot;  thing. You don&#39;t HAVE to \nprove \n&gt; &gt; anything scientifically, unless  you want others to completely believe \nin \n&gt; &gt; your evidence.\n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The theory that is being kicked around is that some EVP&#39;s  are \npersonal, \n&gt; &gt; and only meant for the person recording them to  hear.

Has option to slow the \n  recording down.=\r\n Another nice feature is that you can use either a highpass or \n  lowpass f=\r\nilter (sometimes that is all that is needed) and changing the PITCH \n  is a=\r\n very handy tool. Always KEEP an original copy of your recordings. I just \n=\r\n  save a copy from inside audacity (to desktop or somewhere) then I will st=\r\nart \n  my work on trying to clear it up. Save the original (and proceeding =\r\nenhanced \n  version(s) by using the &quot;file&quot; button at to left corner oif pro=\r\ngram. There you \n  would SAVE &quot;selection&quot; as MP3.(To upload to here) or sav=\r\ne to WAV (is bigger) \n  but higher qulity. Can always convert the wav to mp=\r\n3 from withing audacity \n  also. *you will need to get the mps &quot;pluging&quot; fr=\r\nom the website, and follow the \n  information to install it &quot;manually&quot; (onc=\r\ne is only needed) that way you get \n  the mp3 converter program free. But r=\r\neally...Audacity is a pretty good program \n  to have round. Has a nice &quot;und=\r\no&quot; fesature too, if you make a mistake.

If you have to have high \n  quality &lt;BR&gt;&gt; devices &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to=\r\n make it out, it just isn&#39;t good \n  enough.

Even so, \n  if I am trying to=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; remain unbiased and objective, there is no way \n  for me to =\r\nsay this is a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; spirit, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; without personally \n  being wi=\r\nth you when you caught it. The only thing I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  s=\r\ntill say about it is could be, but for me it is non conclusive.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If someone does not hear what you are hearing, try to re=\r\nmain \n  objective &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; just understand that it isn&#39;t =\r\npersonal. \n  You have to understand that with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; just these reco=\r\nrdings alone, \n  there is no way to scientifically prove &lt;BR&gt;&gt; what &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; you have \n  recorded is spirit communication. If you could get co=\r\nnsistent, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  intelligent question and answer recordings, then=\r\n you would be alot &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  closer.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Here agai=\r\nn, we are back to the &quot;So what?&quot; \n  thing.
