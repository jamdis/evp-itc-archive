Hiya Bruce
   
  I can hear most of those as you did, some I hear more words like "Bruce did you have fun 'today" 
   
  Also in the additional feedback one I can hear it as a longer sentence they speak behind your voice saying "he wants us to give' additional feedback" starting at about 2 seconds if I remember correctly
   
  Good work, keep it up and keep learning. No method is perfect but we can all still learn and make use of the imperfections. Most mediums with more of a direct contact will tell you thiers is not a perfect method all the time either. I dont think we are meant to cross the boundaries completely until it is our time to do so. But we are explorers and more people become aware each day, and open thier minds to the idea that something else exists around them which they were previously unaware of.
   
  Good stuff!
  Misty
