I&#39;m still having a hard time convincing myself that I&#39;m not  \nmatrixing this whole thing, but the box has been repeating the number  \nseven, the name Frank, the name Eva, had a bout of swearing, and then  \ncompletely stunning me by seemingly saying that Tom was here, &quot;Your  \nTom.&quot; Which blew me away because I have a great uncle named Tom whose  \nburial records I was looking for just last night. Finally a female  \nvoice told me, &quot;Ann stop.&quot; I said okay and she returned, &quot;Thank you.&quot;\n\nI hope no one minds my sharing. This is a big moment for me.\n\nAnn"}
