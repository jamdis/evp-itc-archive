Yes, the old "demon chasing" crap, once again. 

I brought the  following thought up elsewhere and will bring it up 
here for  consideration, too. If ghosts are coming through the box 
and thus are  not in a good state of mind, how come on Paranormal 
State CM was willing  to believe the message given by the ghost via 
the box as being truth  (The ghost via the box said a "demon" was 
holding the ghosts captive  there)? 

I would suggest that perhaps a ghost (assuming we are  talking about a 
disembodied person who remains earthbound) is not in a  healthy state 
of mind one would consider "stable," but trapped in  emotional trauma 
of some sort. Thus, how reliable could the message of a  ghost then 
be? ;)
