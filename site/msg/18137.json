This experiment asks for participants to determine what\n&gt; that object is. Vague or partial answers won&#39;t be counted (for example, just\n&gt; giving a color, shape, size, what it&#39;s made of, etc): we&#39;re looking for what\n&gt; it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Monday won&#39;t count. Participants\n&gt; can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means they chose. At\n&gt; the end of the experiment, I will reveal the object, and a tally of the\n&gt; number of correct and/or incorrect answers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In order to keep me honest, I have taken a picture of the object at the\n&gt; start of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of\n&gt; this group. The idea with this file is that you can download it now and\n&gt; &#39;keep it safe&#39; on your computer. Then at the end of the experiment, I will\n&gt; post the password so you can reveal the contents of the file. That way, you\n&gt; were in control of the original image during the entire test, not me.

I have a couple monitors stacked\n&gt; in my closet too: they are not the monitors used in this experiment (and\n&gt; have nothing else on them anyway), and I have several laptops around: they\n&gt; are also not the monitors in this experiment.
