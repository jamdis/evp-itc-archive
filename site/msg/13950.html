<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi frank, I am new to your ground and I was curious where if you have a site where you sell the boxes that you make personally.. I know that I can I buy one of the standard boxes in various places or I could make one my self... if only I was suave enough to be able to fallow the directions.. unfortunately I have never really been a direction type of person.
I have always been extra sensitive and very interested in EVP and the paranormal every since I was very little and when I heard of your boxes recently I became very excited and would love to buy one, can you point me in the right direction..
Thank you, Susan</pre>
