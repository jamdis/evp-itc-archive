<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>FINALLY! I got audacity working and processed my 1/19/10 session with my &quot;Tom&#x27;s
Tube&quot; ghostbox

I was quite impressed, if I say so myself. Cant vouch for their authenticity
though, as I could not hear the questions and the requests I asked. The voices
sound quite plain and do not seem to be a snatch of radio sound--as I can hear
the scans in the background.

One seems to say &quot;Its Oh for naught&quot; and someething else at the end of it. The
other file seems to say &quot;get down&quot; in a fast faint voice near the beginning,
followed by a louder &quot;he was like 40&quot;

Im gonna have to put an external mike on the other recorder channel so I can
hear what I am saying and get some context to better interpret the validity of
the message (radio or paranormal)

That 25 inch long , 2 inch pipe that I use for a resonator seems to be very
effective.</pre>
