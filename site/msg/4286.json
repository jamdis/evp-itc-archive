Joe&#39;s box is \ndefinetely different than other boxes out there, i know i&#39;ve used \nthem all.

I \n&gt; have just asked, &quot;Is there something you want to say?&quot; and then \n&gt; before and while I repeat the question, a voice says, &quot;-the fuck \nup. \n&gt; Shut the--&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The second clip happens later. I had asked &quot;What is my name?&quot; and \n&gt; the earlier (&quot;shutthefuckup&quot;) smart-alecky voice had \nanswered &quot;Ursula \n&gt; Anne&quot; in a singsong way (This is a little weird because my real \nname \n&gt; is Anne Ursula, so kids used to tease me by calling me Ursula Anne \nat \n&gt; school after I started going by my middle name at age 11.) \n&gt; \n&gt; The second clip starts immediately after, when the same voice \n&gt; says, &quot;Zip It!&quot;\n&gt; Then, a second voice says, &quot;Shhh. Listen, you&#39;ll scare her.&quot; \n&gt; Then the first voice says, &quot;Aww!&quot; Then something I can&#39;t make out \nin \n&gt; short bursts.\n&gt; Then, I say &quot;I&#39;m listening&quot; because I heard &quot;Listen&quot; from the \nsecond \n&gt; voice.\n&gt; After my voice you hear &quot;Here you go!&quot; and then &quot;What&#39;s Up?!&quot; from \n&gt; that second voice again.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m full of wonder about this box. It was odd. People say the \nboxes \n&gt; FEEL different from anything else, and I really did. I KNEW \nsomehow \n&gt; when I started that second session that there would be something, \nand \n&gt; it was like the language opened itself up to me. It&#39;s a very \n&gt; different sounding sort of thing from anything else. I can&#39;t \nreally \n&gt; describe it. It&#39;s much, much different from anything I&#39;ve done \n&gt; before and quite Awe-some in a literal sense.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was also very surprised that I wasn&#39;t at all afraid of whatever \n&gt; idiot was swearing and saying stupid things. Like a bully on a \n&gt; playground, really. Nothing scarier than that. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks, Steve, for giving me the chance to experience this tool. \nAnd \n&gt; thanks, Frank, dear Frank who I&#39;ve never met, for having the box \nidea \n&gt; in the first place.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ursula\n&gt;\n\n\n\n                         \n\r\n--0-1495507523-1197647942=:21543\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Thanks, Steve--&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;I hope to have some more files soon.
