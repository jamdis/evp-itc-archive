There were no thorns in my words. A lot of expression is lost or misunderstood in email, if you took offense to anything I wrote, it was not meant that way. I agree most people in the paranormal community (The Ghost Hunter generation) do not have the understanding to grasp what we as a group are saying. I have had endless arguments with paranormal investigators over this very subject. Is it real or is it delusional rhetoric? To my knowledge no one has ever won that argument on either side of the coin. They say prove it, we say disprove it! With that being said, I am not a box researcher, I am an ITC researcher. I use many methods to obtain the messages I get because the message, not the equipment is what&#39;s important.\n\nPotential researchers will make their way to us at their own pace because we cannot force people to &#39;get it&#39;. The connection we share with our spirit friends is through our hearts and spirits. Its a positive attitude, pure intent, desire and the will to communicate that allows those switches to be flipped in our minds.\n\nI agree with you totally Bruce. We need more and more people with the above mentioned attributes in this world let alone this field of research. Can we ever prove to anyone that this is real? No! Can we show them it is real? We can try! People may call me a defeatist for not promoting or defending ITC, but I don&#39;t think so. My original goal is not to convince the world that this is real. If they are supposed to &quot;get it&quot;, they will.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nFrank R.\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: bruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt;\nTo: evp-itc@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Monday, December 31, 2007 7:55:17 AM\nSubject: RE: [EVP-ITC] we have a hard row to hoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n            \n\n\nFrank,\n\n \n\nThis only becomes an issue when new people get interested in our research and seek information from the usual paranormal community and are met with these type of answers and explanations.
