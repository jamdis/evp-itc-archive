Too bad.
   
  So when we play the radio, as I think Frank may have said, the spirits use the electronic signal to form a voice.
   
  I have the 12-469 that has the clicking noise on AM.
   
  Had a thought, not sure what age you are, but I remember my dad used aluminum foil to enhance electronics, ie the rabbit ears on the tv.
   
  I tried something today with hopes to get rid of the clicking.
   
  I wrapped the radio in foil, but the ticking noise stayed the same, and I lost all radio gibberish. As soon as I took off the foil, the spirits started speaking and radio gibberish was back.
   
  What actually is it in ratio signal they use? Is it the garbled speech from scanning stations, or something else.
   
  I also tried the television today with snow screen and static, but got no results.
   
  Kills me that they can see and hear everything we do, yet we can not get a complete sentence from them, nor see them as they see us.
   
  Has anyone asked the spirits what other methods there are to get better recordings of them that we have not happened onto yet?  Meaning, a device we have on earth, that we just have not tried yet.

          Hi Michael, et al. I'm thinking it won't work because the allophones voice tone and 
enunciation isn't distinct enough for the program to learn recognition (as Aaron 
mentioned). My father recently tried with a friend to have the program learn his voice, and 
was unable to do so (his voice is deep and can be a little hoarse sounding at times, which 
apparently prevented recognition.) Let us know what you discover if you try this.
