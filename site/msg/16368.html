Hey Al,

When I started experimenting with the different forms of ITC I use=
 to get the Help Me's also. I found that it was not only me but some associ=
ates of mine experienced the same phenomenon. One of my friends got so wrap=
ped up in trying to help them it threatened her health (as in she was extre=
mely fatigued and close to mental collapse). Speaking with others outside m=
y "circle" I found that this was common and was told it will pass. 

I have=
 kind of a hypothesis on this experience I would like to share. Seeing that=
 the layered or "level" model of existence is widely accepted I will refer =
to it. Beyond our physical presence lies many layers of reality with those =
closest our own being the densest and darkest. Some folks or beings (not al=
l have physically lived) get stuck in these layers for various reasons. The=
y are lost if you will!? Being that they are so close to our own "living vi=
bration", they are the easiest for us to tune into and pick up across our c=
hosen medium (radio, recorder, or whatever). In other words we act as the a=
ntenna and the radio is the reciever... Because they are presumably stuck t=
hey constantly reach out for help but the sad part is they are the only one=
s that can help themselves. As you progress in your experiments, you will e=
ventually evolve beyond that level and tune into higher (or lower) vibratio=
ns. Keep in mind some of them will be sweet as candy while
 others can be n=
asty. If you get a nasty one tell the others to keep them quite or you will=
 cease contact. It usually works!

Regards,

Frank R.

=C2=A0 
Hi,

Awhile back I stopped recording evps because I go=
t unnerved when I began hearing the voices without a radio or recorder. Aft=
er learning more, I decided to pursue my interest with the help of EVP Make=
r software rather than a hacked radio. Today I picked up an EVP on my first=
 attempt. I've uploaded it to the new "Al's Files" folder. 

The significan=
ce: My full first name is Alger, but I go by "Al" because most people mispr=
onounce Alger. It appears that the spirit entity knows my full first name. =
Do you guys understand the sentence the way that I am hearing it: "Alger he=
lp me" ? Most people incorrectly pronounce Alger with a "grrr" growling sou=
nd rather than the softer "jer." The evp seems to have gotten the pronuncia=
tion right, though it is difficult to make out distinctly in the robotic vo=
ice.

Another question: I get a lot of "Help me" statements. What is that a=
ll about? Any theories? From what do they need help? Anyone else get a lot =
of calls for "help" ?

Thanks,
Al
