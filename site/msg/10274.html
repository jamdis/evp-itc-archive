Kay,
 
Everything Frank R. just said I have been preaching for a year.
It =
is alway's about the harmony and positive energy.
 
And anyone knows that t=
he technology is just a way of getting the message across.
The whole meanin=
g of my post was misconscrued it was only meant to spark some energy 
to mo=
ve foward with all the research, technical and spiritual.
 
But sadly Kay m=
y posts here are carefully scrutinised by some, and the slightest miswordin=
g
or lack of clarity in a post will present certain people with the opportu=
nity to take a shot.
 
That is the reason I left this group a couple of mon=
ths ago.
I returned hoping to help people, but when I try to pass on any kn=
owledge gained from experience
Some feel threatened and a nedd to countermi=
ne anything I say.
 
When was the last time you read a post From Frank R.
 =

This post and a couple of others will probably not make it to the board.
I=
f not you will all recieve private copies.
