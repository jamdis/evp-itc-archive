But I have a lot of evidence that contradicts that, too.\n\nI like to make recordings in all sorts of places, some supposedly haunted,\nsome not supposedly haunted, some have no reason to be haunted (like a\nbrand-new shopping mall) and the responses or lack of them is totally\nunpredictable.\n\nI&#39;ve been in several of the supposedly most haunted cemeteries in Illinois\nmany times, day and night, and recorded several hours of audio in them,\nasking questions that might get an EVP response. In some I got nothing.\nOther cemeteries that were supposedly haunted got some responses. A lot of\nother places (old and new buildings, etc.) also seemed to get a few EVP\nresponses occasionally and at other times nothing.\n\nSo all I can say is that what happens, happens. I can&#39;t predict it. This\nobserver in particular doesn&#39;t seem to have a lot to do with the presence or\nlack of responses and what those responses will be.\nZack\n\n\nOn Wed, May 26, 2010 at 3:28 PM, Frank Sumption\n&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\nSo why spend time ghost huntig if you think there&#39;s nothign to it?
