I'm sticking with it, it's just too damn intriguing. It's the trying to sh=

RE: [EVP-ITC] The rest of the ding file





This is my first post in this =
group, so hello to everyone here. Frank's post prompted me to reply since I=
 understand the frustration involved in paranormal investigations. It seems=
 that every time we think we have something figured out, the rules change -=
 so back to square one again.
 
I have been involved in paranormal studies =
from childhood, part of which came from living in a house which was a civil=
-war era funeral parlor.Over the years I've studied most aspects of the str=
ange, from ghosts to UFOs to Bigfoot, to... well, you get the idea. The las=
t few years I've been involved particularly with ghosts and have been study=
ing the methods of spirit communications closely. I am semi-retired now and=
 have plenty of time for experimentation. My educational background is in G=
eology, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. I spent many years des=
igning analog sensors and other devices for well logging and oilfield instr=
umentation.
 
Which brings me to what I wanted to say to Frank...
 
Don't g=
ive up. Take a break from it for a while, and be less concerned what others=
 think. If you have high standards, then your work will prove itself. There=
 are always going to be naysayers and backbiters and they will never be sat=
isfied with what you produce, so ignore them, and work with those who have =
open minds and the ability to use critical analysis without being totally n=
egative. I believe your approch has merit, and am working on duplicating on=
e of your devices myself.
 
The last couple of years I have been closely ex=
amining methods of monitoring VLF-ELF frequencies and demodulating audio fr=
om them. This is the world of 'Earth Sounds' and over the years I have had =
some interesting results, particularly of voices singing and shreds of spee=
ch. My NASA Inspire receiver was the starting point, but it was too broad b=
anded and desparately needed 60Hz notch filtering so I have retired it and =
am now starting development from the ground up on a receiver targeted for 2=
0 - 2000 Khz in the EM spectrum. There is more to this than just adapting a=
 high-gain audio amplifier - a lot of filtration needs to be done and I'm e=
liminating the use of any local oscillators or mixers to eliminate possible=
 overload products from the broadcast band.
 
Like you, I have a few detrac=
tors who tell me I'm wasting my time but I also have a good research group =
(A.S.U.P.) who is totally supportive. If you have seen any of the articles =
in Haunted Times or other publications about highly modified K-II EMF detec=
tors being used, I plead guilty. I have built and distributed about ten of =
them to various people and groups, and have had some very encouraging feedb=
ack.
 
So stay with it Frank, don't be discouraged, keep studying, working =
and posting...
 
Thanks for the bandwidth and perhaps we can all exchange s=
ome good ideas here.
 
Ron
