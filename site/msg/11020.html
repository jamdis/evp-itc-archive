Hey Mick
  Well I have been
called worse. You have to remember if they were=
n=A2t nice in life there not  nice  in
death. Personality=A2s  would cross =
over
also. Usually they try and intimidate  you. I use positive  reforcemen=
t. It
usually very rare of it being anything to worry about. You can choose=
 to ignore
it or confront it  telling them that you
would rather not hear t=
hat. And if  they
don=A2t have any thing nice to say then to move on. They =
usually get a bit more
nasty at this point. But if your positive  they will=
 get  the message and leave you alone or move on. This is  just my approach=
. There are many out there
that will have some other  approach. And there
r=
eally no right answer, it is what ever work for you. And what your conferra=
ble
with. And of course your beliefs. I ca only base my opinions on my expe=
riences,
and what work for me . for example I never do a protection prayer =
 before I enter a location, u feel what on the
inside and what you believe =
makes you strong. But again this is what works for
me  personally.shadow   =
