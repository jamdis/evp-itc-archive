I somehow believe we are all connected and that we \nbring these &quot;spirits&quot; with us...we carry them continualy, somehow \nsurrounded by them.  In the physical world, the only way we can try \nto wrap our brain around that idea is to think of them as \nbeing &quot;outside&quot; of us&quot; or &quot;around us&quot; as the box would make us \nbelieve; yet I am wondering if they are really &quot;within&quot; us in some \nway...perhaps that maybe your thoughts are not really all yours, but \nmaybe a mixture of their thoughts and ours - collectively speaking.\n\nIf I freaked anybody, it&#39;s early and I&#39;m not awake this morning...\n\nLC\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jules&quot; &lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I was thinking tonight as Frank S. welcomed some of our new comers \nto \n&gt; the group if in fact anyone during a box session inquired to the \nnames \n&gt; in which the other side call us?\n&gt; \n&gt; For instance Frank has been addressed as princess, and I know I \nhave \n&gt; gotten a spirit stating he was my brother (I am an only child).  I \nam \n&gt; curious as to whether or not this could in fact be affilated with a \n&gt; past or former life.  That at one time Frank S. could have been of \n&gt; royality and I could in fact have had siblings.\n&gt; \n&gt; How far fetched is it that we could be actually talking to spirits \nwe \n&gt; once had a relationship with or if that is even possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would welcome any imput on my wild and crazy thoughts!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Juli\n&gt;"}
