I did the first long bike ride of the season, with a \n&gt; headwind most of the way, only twenty miles, but it was grueling. I \n&gt; was wiped out till about 8pm. \n&gt; \n&gt;  I now have a low voltage warning light for systems with gel cells, \n&gt; or other rechargable batteries. Probably should just incorporate it \n&gt; in the circuits, the sweep will run at low voltages, but you get \nless \n&gt; and less of the top of the bands as the battery voltage drops. \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt;  --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;misujoey&quot; &lt;Debbie@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please join www.livescifi.TV &lt;http://www.livescifi.tv/&gt;  &quot;In \nSearch \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Paranormal&quot;, as they perform a LIVE Interactive ITC Session.
