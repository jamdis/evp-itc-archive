How is the conection ? ... 11 to -12v or 0 . 4 to\n&gt;&gt; +12 ? .... I tried , and conecting 11 to 0 v , i got a triangular wave ,\n&gt;&gt; but , i couldnt get a apropiate dc level , the minimum level i got was\n&gt;&gt; almost 14v , when i tried more low dc level , the wave lose the form , and\n&gt;&gt; the offset pot didnt go ok , it didnt have any effect in triangular wave .\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
