<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think right now the only truly digital radios we are likely to come
across are Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM). But those that I know of are
on shortwave and I don&#x27;t think anyone here is likely to be using one.

&gt;  Many &quot;digital&quot; radios are just analog radios that are tuned with a voltage
&gt; that the processor puts out, the radio itself is analog. I disconnect the
&gt; processor board, after determining the function of the signals going to the
&gt; radio board. You have to be able to turn on the radio itself with no
&gt; processor board, then find the band change connection, the tuning voltage
&gt; connection.
&gt;
&gt;   In the first boxes I used tuner modules removed from car stereos, then
&gt; after the hack was &quot;discovered&quot; I started using other radios, such as the
&gt; Radio Shack models, but I would only use the radio board, and disgard the
&gt; rest. I have used walkman style radios as well, again, disgarding the
&gt; processor board.  Usually there is a ribbon cable to the radio, you just
&gt; have to determine what voltages are needed to operate the radio, and supply
&gt; these from a power supply or voltage regulator.
&gt;
&gt;  I use Arm Band radios, Headphone radios, alarm clock radios that have
&gt; digital tuning. I try to find radios that have a seperate tuner board.
&gt;
&gt;  So far radios that use a square chip seem to be software controled, so I
&gt; avoid those. Not all digital radios are usable. The car tuners tend to be
&gt; noisy.
&gt;
&gt;  Sometimes you can find the tuning voltage in a radio and just cut he
&gt; connection, then insert an external tuning voltage from a sweep circuit. I
&gt; have a Aiwa home stereo system that I made into a box using this method.
&gt; It&#x27;s not portable, but it works well, it has the advantage of a built in
&gt; tape recorder.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; One question Frank , its posible make a frank box whith an analogic radio
&gt;&gt; ?
&gt;&gt; ... its a problem make it here in Peru . The digital radios are all whith
&gt;&gt; the &quot;Mute&quot; , and the &quot;beep&quot; , its a problem , i cant still make , Are
&gt;&gt; there
&gt;&gt; any simple radio can i build ? ... whith a simply chip , in u.s.a are the
&gt;&gt; radio shack´s radios , its are simply to hack , but here in peru , there
&gt;&gt; are
&gt;&gt; only radios like &quot;walkman&quot; style , or discmans ,
