Golden Phoenix,

What kind of equipment did you use for your ITC's?

guess, so I used to have a blast with the itcs but after some of the exeriences I have pretty well avoided doing anymore. we were in a rental house that was not as good place to do ITCs very dark and ominuse activity in that place. many folks know I have been doing this a long long time and not much bothers me anymore. this was 20 years ago and the tapes are still hidden away in a safe place. the house I was born in was the only one more active and freaky, I have ever been in.

GP, I am glad to see you are here, a friendly face from close by. I am
also glad to see that this site is not all negative. I had just
joined last week, and made the post about the Door to the Dead; and
with all the negative post was thinking about leaving this forum. In
fact I had e-mailed Larry privately expressing that thought.

I have seen a rash of e-mails more up beat so I have gone back to
individual e-mails from the digest. I think I will hang around a
little longer.

For other members in Texas, I'm in Houston, just across the channel
from the Golden Phoenix. I see we are well represented as a state. I
am glad to meet all of you.

Regards,
Jon in Texas

Its all the same "dog and pony" act. Since "Ghost Hunters" has become
a hit "everyone" wants their own tv show or radio show. Its all "look
at me".
