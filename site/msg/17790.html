<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>i wonder if there is a way to get a copy of a pre eched board to iron it onto a new pcb.

&gt; 
&gt; Yes, that board should work. If you have a single-sided board pattern, after
&gt; you&#x27;ve developed the photoresist (or ironed on the toner, if you do it that
&gt; way) spray the other side of the board with spray paint and let dry. I like
&gt; to use the clear coat paint but it doesn&#x27;t really matter.
&gt; 
&gt; After you&#x27;ve etched one side, clean the paint and the photoresist off (clean
&gt; both sides) with acetone, MEK, etc. Do this in a well-ventilated area! Then
&gt; drill your holes.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are going to make a double-sided board, drill a few of the holes that
&gt; have common pads on both sides to orient the pattern on the other side and
&gt; repeat whatever method you use to put a resist on that side. After it&#x27;s
&gt; developed/ironed on, spray the already etched side with paint and etch the
&gt; other side. Clean off the board and drill holes.
