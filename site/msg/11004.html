I started doing evp's about a year ago. I use an Olympus digital 
recorder. I have had some luck. I was given a copy of Gold Wave recently 
and don't know the program yet. I saw that someone offered up a link to 
a free tool but I could only find copies that cost.

About three weeks ago I had a friend over. He has a pretty successful 
investigative team in my area. One of his members brought the 'Franks 
box' to show me since he knows of my interest in ITC. We didn't use it 
however. They had among other instruments, a K-II emf meter. Actually 
they had about 3 meters of different types. I asked if he could use the 
box but he said he didn't know it well enough yet to label anything 
paranormal. He did turn it on and there was a lot of noise and chatter.  
They did quit a few videos as well. The results were not that favorable 
with the video but the emf showed allot of activity. We were able to 
'communicate' using the K-II and asking yes - no questions. I don't have 
the evp's yet. I do have my own evp's from my apartment but not from 
that night. I also have some from a couple cemeteries that I did. I like 
going out by myself which I guess is a big no no in the field of 
paranormal investigation but it hasn't bothered me much at all.

I am trying to get his friend to bring the box back over. I became 
interested in ITC about 11 years ago but never really involved myself 
into it. Someone took a picture of me in my kitchen. When the film was 
developed, a face appeared in the window behind me. There was no way a 
person could have been outside my apartment window. I started doing some 
research on line and that was how I found out about ITC and evp. A few 
years later I saw White Noise and my interest was sparked all over 
again. I have read about the 'Brown box' and was really excited when my 
buddies friend brought over 'Franks box'. With the popularity of all the 
paranormal shows and groups I have decided to concentrate on evp. I am 
now considered an 'investigator in training' but my interest are purely 
personal.

I am assuming that you are the 'Frank' of my friends 'Frank's box'. I 
was really surprised at the coincident when I joined this evp group to 
find out that it is your group.

I hope to learn allot from this group and thanks for having me as a member.

Mick

PS - I was considering moving to Florida but after reading all these 
'bog' post, I may move west.
