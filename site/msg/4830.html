What you&#x27;re hearing are artifacts of the sound clean-up program that  
makes the voices more audible.

These are not EVPs, they are realtime communication. They are heard  
out loud as they happen. That&#x27;s what boxes do--they allow two-way  
real-time exchange between us and them.

&gt; Now I am sure you arent aware of who I am being, noone else other
&gt; than misty welcomed me to this group. Being I am not professional at
&gt; e.v.p.s but yet have gone through listening to many of them from
&gt; trustful resources, your e.v.p.s make me a bit leery. NOt trying to
&gt; be rude, so dont go get all upset right off the bat. In your e.v.p.s,
&gt; this one especially, alot of them sound like you, not the part where
&gt; you asking questions, but where your dad is supposively answering
&gt; you. NOw everyone has their own right to opinion so there is now need
&gt; to get defensive, if all is real there would be nothing to get mad
&gt; about. I just cant help but notice how odd it is that your e.v.p.
&gt; questions to your father, seems to answer right away when you ask the
&gt; question. Also, i notice that after you ask the question i hear
&gt; something being turned on that has contains the answer to that
&gt; question. Whether it be your dad or not. I feel its you that is
&gt; answering, but let me tell you why i figure this.. and please you
&gt; would like to defend you side of things that would be great, maybe i
&gt; would be able to change my opinion on the matter. But as of now,
&gt; e.v.p.s are usually done on the same tape that the questions are on,
&gt; then in a rewind you can hear you and the e.v.p. but to me it sound
&gt; like you put the e.v.p. response on another tape. i am not trying to
&gt; start any kind of fight or be cruel, maybe i could learn something on
&gt; behalf of how you do your work... thank you
