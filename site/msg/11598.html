<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I just posted part of a recording from yesterday (still going through
all of them).  This was recorded at the farm I grew up on, where my
brother and his family now live.  My two nieces (age 17 and 21) have
had various occurrences there so we thought we&#x27;d try out some of this
new stuff and see what we&#x27;d get.  We got quite a few interesting
results I think.

This is part of one where we asked if they are there, and then how
many are there. This one was made with EVPMaker (the RS 20-125 didn&#x27;t
work so well out in the country - maybe not enough noise/sounds for
them to use??)  The answer is &quot;We are at eight, Yeah, there are
eight.&quot;  I think it&#x27;s pretty clear.

What do you think?
