&gt;Interesting, someone just lurking on the site, whose only purpose is to 
&gt;sell
&gt;magazines, and contribute nothing to the discussions, perhaps affraid facts
&gt;might interfere with profits? No doubt other lurkers reporting all that&#x27;s
&gt;said back to various magazines, and &quot;researchers&quot;!.
&gt;
&gt;We don&#x27;t do commercail ads, good bye!
