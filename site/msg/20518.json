Yes, it is funny the things we sometimes think we hear (or they say? lol).  I wasn&#39;t 100% sure it was &quot;foot in mouth&quot; - maybe &quot;food/put/ (something???) in mouth&quot;.  That&#39;s all.  It&#39;s tough to call something like that but there was clearly (to me) something being said that sounded that way between &quot;UFO&quot; and the laugh. Do you hear that?  I mean, do you hear anything in between?  It was in the same voice as I heard it....  hmm....  Maybe they&#39;re messing with me :).\n\nAdrienne\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, jadawanstell@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I did hear the voice laughing but I&#39;ll listen again  for the foot in \n&gt; mouth.. lol funny thing about these evps is sometimes you go  back and hear \n&gt; different things is true..

What could that mean?  Is there  any context \n&gt; involving or surrounding this recording that would account for  that?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I may be wrong.  It&#39;s your recording and it seems like we sometimes  hear \n&gt; different things for whatever reason...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Adrienne\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Jan 29, 2011 at 10:23 AM, &lt;_jadawanstell@..._ \n&gt; (mailto:jadawanstell@...) &gt;  wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; [_Attachment(s)_ (mip://0255f1b8/default.html#12dd25f951174750_TopText)   \n&gt; from _jadawanstell@..._ (mailto:jadawanstell@...)  included below]  \n&gt; Here is one I did back in October.
