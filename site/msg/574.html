I've tried evpmaker, mostly for a background sound source while I was recording. It's too chaotic for most of my contacts and only a few of them ventured to try and communicate. I did hear from other entities who are not in my regular group. 
   
  Water gives me the best results so far. And the messages are much easier for me to hear. I enjoy hearing the accents and the clarity (when its there) is amazing. The robotic voices are ok too but my first evp was my mothers voice so really for me there is no comparison. I record the exact same way as I did the first accidental time I recorded her voice. Only I have updated and made improvements along the way. Often they give suggestions for other methods and I sometimes try them out with good success but they are not as productive as using water.
   
  I can record 30 seconds of water noise and get 5-15 full sentences compared to getting one or two words or phrases using some of the other methods I have tried. Many people have alot of fear about over analyzing the sound files but that is the least of my worries. I know the system isnt perfect, the entities know the system is flawed and we make use of the flaws to the best of our abilities.
   
  So just find a method that works for you and with you rather than do what anyone tells you to do. There are no experts in EVP or ITC. We are all students and we are all learning as we go..... and hopefully sharing/teaching what we learned with others. Try several methods and see what works best and go from there. Once you make contact then you can work on improving the contact.

          Hi Misty,

Thank you for the reply and the advices! I'll keep experimenting with 
several setups. I think i'll try to play the white noise through a 
speaker and record via microphone.

What about EVPMaker, do you get good results with it? I haven't 
studied it but i have some doubts regarding how exactly the spirits 
manage to imprint the voices, since it's a digital process?!

Regards,
Jaime.
