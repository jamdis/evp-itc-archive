That&#39;s \nmy old music training coming out of me and used to describe a spacing \nbetween words spelling out a message, such as a word spoken every \nother second, etc - sounds abnormal in regular conversation but with \nsome of these recordings it happens quite frequently.  Maybe this is \ndue to the frequency changes, which also sometimes creates sort of a \nskip:  &quot;They may (may) be able to (to) help me.&quot;\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Misty&quot; &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I tend to be more surprised when they hear it exactly as I do. \nOften \n&gt; its not on the &quot;clearer&quot; ones that I think everyone will hear. \n&gt; Sometimes we upload the clearest files and others dont hear it. \nThat \n&gt; can be for a number of reasons. Perception and equipment being used \n&gt; for playback as well as individual hearing differs, etcetera. I \nknow \n&gt; when I listen to my own files on different speakers or headphones \nthe \n&gt; sound quality differs. It&#39;s just clearer on some than others.\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   No doubt, no one will hear the same thing I did.
