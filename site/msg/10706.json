Forgot that Victor Zammit&#39;s \nbook gives more details. I&#39;ll have to dig out Peter Bander&#39;s book and \ncompare it to the sections of Sheila Ostrander&#39;s and Lynn Schroeder&#39;s \nbook &quot;Handbook of Psi Discoveries&quot; as Ostrander and Schroeder did \noccasionally make mistakes.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Michael Edwards &lt;f1cracker75@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks Frank Ratka!\n&gt;    \n&gt;   FYI to all our members, check this stie out, especially near the \nbottom where the Vatican is discussed.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Also, how about we all form a pact!!\n&gt;    \n&gt;   If any of us dies, we set up a group on the other side like ours \nto work with us earth bounders. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Any takers!!!!\n&gt;    \n&gt;   http://www.victorzammit.com/book/chapter04.html\n&gt;    \n&gt;    \n&gt;    \n&gt;    \n&gt;   \n&gt;"}
