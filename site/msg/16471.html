Thanks David but I really dont like the spotlight speaker stuff. There are =
several in this group who shine and are better suited for public speaking t=
han I am. Jeff Rezman (Wednesdays nights) and Steve Hultay (Sunday nights) =
have talk shows and Stephen Hill will soon have a new show on Friday nights=
 at paranormaltvnetwork.com so plenty of others to speak to on this topic w=
ho get some great communication.

Just realized that I=
