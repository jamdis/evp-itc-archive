I have hacked \nanother AM/FM to do the ole&#39; raw audio band sweep routine.  This was \none of those &quot;Made in China&quot; AM/FM/Cassette combos.\nNothing like the clarity and smooth sweep operation of the Radio Shack \nHack models 12-470 (older version) & 12-469 (clicking model)... but it \nprovides those snippets and fragments some enjoy so much.\n\n- Mike"}
