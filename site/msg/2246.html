lol Frank.. @ people getting possessed by the box.   You're right, that could be a nightmare.  I agree some of those images are definitely interesting, I showed my son the 'weird cat' and asked him what he thought it was and he said "well mom, that is a robot cat!"  lol, that lady that looks like she is taking a portrait- that was definitely weird- mostly because it looks like she doesn't have eyes?  She has spots for eyes but if you blow it up a little it looks like no eyeball- something definitely very strange about that one!

 I still don't know if all of the images are paranormal, but there's some that are probable. Those two women in front of TV are pretty interesting to me. 
 
 I'm almost afraid of producing the boxes, I wouldn't have a moment's peace, or rest. I can just imagine the support issues, especially from those that the box just won't work for. What about people that think they get possessed with it--it could be a nightmare.
