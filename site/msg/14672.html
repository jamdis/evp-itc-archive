<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Not likely a faulty breaker but it could be. In the winter electrical
devices that heat, such as heat tape and heaters, can do that. It could
also be some other faulty electrical device. It could be a bad wiring
connection or even a bad power meter (I had that happen last winter).

Those touch lamps usually use some sort of CMOS IC or MOSFET device that is
sensitive to capacitance. Touching the base adds capacitance that they sense
and switch as a result. Those devices have a lifetime of maybe 5 to 10 years
from my experience and start switching on their own at random.

&gt;  Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; Is there someone here that can answer and electrical question for me?
&gt;
&gt; During the case that I recorded those possible EVP&#x27;s-there was a loud
&gt; tapping noise that seemed to come from the 2nd bedroom. Upon checking my
&gt; logs, every time one of  these clicks were heard, there would be an EMF
&gt; spike in the livingroom. The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the livingroom
&gt; downstairs. The home owners have also reported that they have a touch lamp
&gt; that comes on all the time by itself and the lights in the Kitchen will dim
&gt; occasionally.
&gt;
&gt; Now these taps are not consistent in timing, loudness or rhythm. Could this
&gt; be the work of faulty breakers?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; April

No likely a aul y b eake bu i could be. In he win e elec ical de ices ha hea , such as hea ape and hea e s, can do ha . I could also be some o he aul y elec ical de ice. I could be a bad wi ing connec ion o e en a bad powe me e (I had ha happen las win e ).

 
Those ouch lamps usually use some so o CMOS IC o MOSFET de ice ha is sensi i e o capaci ance. Touching he base adds capaci ance ha hey sense and swi ch as a esul . Those de ices ha e a li e ime o maybe 5 o 10 yea s om my expe ience and s a swi ching on hei own a andom.
