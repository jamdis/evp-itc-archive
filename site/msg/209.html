Hi Misty,
Your I miss you file sounds like "If I was new, you could not use=
 this"  So maybe it means your contacts must have experience to use this me=
thod??

The other one sounds like "see I'm the divinest (sp?) of one"

Very=
 cool.  I'll have to check that method out. I've done something similar wit=
h AM in between channels, that seemed to work well, but they warned me that=
 it may not be accepted by the others.  I'm guessing they meant the skeptic=
s or other evp researchers.

Jody

  Sort of Jody. I am using a pc tv/fm card without the fm antenna=
 hooked up. I watch tv on my pc sometimes and it has radio. There are frien=
ds there who loved using the computer so they are always talking about it a=
nd what I need to do with it. Some of the things I have tried and it worked=
, some I havent gotten around to yet. This was one they mentioned and I tri=
ed but the results werent astounding me until recently.

  I still bounce b=
ack to the old "water" method and use it along with the radio. I asked them=
 if anyone could use this method and the results were varied. I guess it de=
pends on who the person is. For instance I had one voice say clearly "it re=
ally works", then once I saved it and played it back it had changed to "it =
didnt work". But heres one answer that didnt change so perhaps you can hear=
 this one. I'll also add the it really works one for you to see what you he=
ar on your end. If you hear it really works maybe you can use this method e=
asily.

      Frank This came after I emailed you so perhaps its a nota=
tion to add to what I said about thier words sometimes get edited or have m=
ore meaning later on. The message is improved in time. I am still not sure =
who used to be proud of me because I forgot to ask for names and later sess=
ions were not as clear.

      The signals were very strong today here. I d=
id a session us ing the pc fm radio set to the station "they" requested usi=
ng no antenna hookup and then ran it thru the filter "they" made me stumble=
 upon...the conversation was so loud in some parts it kinda freaked me out =
a little bit at first LOL 

      I dont usually use that method alot becau=
se it never has good results unless I mute it while recording even then it =
only increases thier signal a bit louder which I can do using amplify or tu=
rn the volume up.

      It's stormy here the past few days so perhaps that=
 is a f actor.
