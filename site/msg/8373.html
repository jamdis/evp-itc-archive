<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Stefan, et al.  I just ran a test session by dropping the Speak Jet Allophones WAV into 
SoundSoap2.  I pressed play, then used my cursor to sweep back and forth through the 
file.  I was essentially trying to replicate something similar to a manual radio sweep using 
the tones.  I immediately received two direct, relevant responses to my questions, which 
really surprised me!

In the first, I asked, &quot;How does this work?&quot; The reply is, &quot;I have to say the people are 
talking, but I don&#x27;t really care.&quot;  LOL - guess I&#x27;ve been told.  ;0)

In the second, I asked for a name and was told, &quot;It&#x27;s Patrick.&quot;  This really surprised me as 
Patrick (along with David and a female I have never been able to identify) is the name of 
one of my tech helpers who speaks to me mostly through the MiniBox, but also has come 
through during radio sweeps. 

The last message was a comment I don&#x27;t quite understand, &quot;I&#x27;m in contact with 
[counterfeits or counterbase.]&quot;  Whatever that means.

Anyway, I thought I share this discovery about the SoundSoap2/allophones combo with 
the group because it appears to also have potential for receiving communication, and I 
figured some of you might want to try it as well.
