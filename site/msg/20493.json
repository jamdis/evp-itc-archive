Voice sounds like: I&#39;ll bet.   Then at second 5 you can hear some say &quot;pizza&quot; in a lower voice.  Then immediately after I ask, &quot;You guys like pizza?&quot; And I immediately hear a distorted, harmonic &quot;everybody&quot; (assuming they mean &quot;everybody likes pizza&quot;) then at second 8 I hear a harmonic &quot;I&#39;ll bet you did&quot;  The only very clear part is the first &quot;I&#39;ll bet&quot; but if you listen a bit more closer the other things can be heard too. \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Adriana%27s%20Files/0404illbet.mp3 \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.html\nRegards,\n\nadrianamjones &lt;adrianamjones@...&gt;"}
