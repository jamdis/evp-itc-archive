RJ that is a great idea, just please do this for the right reason.
If you a=
re enthusiastic about this, we need other ideas........
Just remember to be=
 respectful of other researchers . Everyone is just
trying to 
come up with=
 ideas . Understanding is what we all want.
Positivity is a good thing. Don=
't make it personal.... : )
Thanks for helping.

I am going to conduct a little experiment, if you all don't mind.
I wil=
l give these instructions to several people.  I encourage those
here to try=
 it too.

Listen to the 3rd video on that page. 
http://www.youtube.com/wat=
ch?v=3D8nm3EhR9PTc&eurl=3Dhttp://www.ufogeek.com/v
ftse.htm

Listen especia=
lly from 4:00 to 4:10
But do not go past 4:10, because then he says what he=
 thinks it is
saying.

Tell me what you think, if anything, the words in 4:=
00-4:10 are saying,
before you have gone past 4:10 and heard what the perso=
n on the audio
then says he thinks he hears.

Thanks for posting.   =
 I am going through them now.

Could you explain more what you meant when y=
ou said you ran the audio
file through an algorithm that adds vocal-chord- =
like sounds?  To what
software/function do you refer that adds those?
