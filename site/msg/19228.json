Here are a few I recorded\nwith him during a different session.  In one of the clips you will hear\nsomeone from the other side call me a freak.  I picked this guy up over a\nmonth ago and he likes to hang around and call me freak whenever I do a\nsession.  I find it pretty funny because he is so consistent; during this\nsession he called me freak multiple times.\n\nTim\n\nOn Fri, Nov 19, 2010 at 12:20 PM, Frank Sumption\n&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  [Attachment(s) &lt;#12c652777c0732c2_TopText&gt; from Frank Sumption included\n&gt; below]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI was a Rolling Hills wi h F ank ha nigh .  He e a e a ew I eco ded wi h him du ing a di e en session.  In one o he clips you will hea someone om he o he side call me a eak.  I picked his guy up o e a mon h ago and he likes o hang a ound and call me eak whene e I do a session.  I ind i p e y unny because he is so consis en ; du ing his session he called me eak mul iple imes.\nTimOn F i, No 19, 2010 a 12:20 PM, F ank Sump ion pu plealiengi l@...> w o e:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n [A achmen (s) om F ank Sump ion included below]"}
