<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I understand where Rick is coming from, BUT his suggestion is a good 
example of how to conduct the test IF I were testing those I asked to 
help, which I&#x27;m not.  This is not a test, just a means of gathering 
audio with the use of material associated with a plane crash, at a 
location other than where the crash happened.

All I asked them to do is provide five, 30 second audio files which 
they record while using the pieces of debris I will be sending them.
I have faith in the researchers on this forum who have volunteered 
(six people so far have been selected).  

Whatever is found on the audio files will be studied, and since I 
will be the one listening to the recordings, and since I already know 
all the details of the incident, I have not set my mind to 
predetermine anything.

Yes, a different type of test could have been done, and I could have 
hidden all information, but that would not have mattered for this 
effort, since the outcome is to only get the audio files, what ever 
may be found on them.

Thanks to those who have volunteered, I cound still use four more 
people too.

&gt; I have to agree with Rick, the less information in a situation like 
&gt; this- the better.  When we do investigations, I supply very little 
&gt; information to my team, as a matter of fact, I prefer to be kept in 
the 
&gt; dark (no pun intended) as much as possible myself.    This type of 
&gt; phenomenon is common in many fields, it is simply the power of 
&gt; suggestion, there are hundreds of document cases where a well 
meaning 
&gt; witness who truly wants to provide accurate &amp; honest information, 
can be 
&gt; led by innocent suggestions.
&gt; 
&gt; A really really good example of this is Derren Brown.   Watch this 
&gt; video...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQjr1YL0zg     Of 
course, I 
&gt; don&#x27;t think Rick nor anyone was suggesting you would intentionally 
lead 
&gt; anyone, but it is sooo easy to do so.

&gt; &gt;     Prejudice refers to prejudgment. So, in this case, prejudice 
meant to
&gt; &gt;     already be ready to hear what someone already described, 
rather than
&gt; &gt;     listening before you have that information, and so can 
maximize your
&gt; &gt;     objectivity.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     Maybe you could clarify what you meant by my viewpoint? I 
didn&#x27;t
&gt; &gt;     understand the comment.

&gt; &gt;     &gt; Funny you use the word prejudice. Says a bit about your 
viewpoint.

&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; To insure this testing is objective, wouldn&#x27;t it have been
&gt; &gt;     best not
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; to inform everyone what kind of disaster these items were
&gt; &gt;     from? Now
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; that everyone knows they are from a plane crash, that 
will set
&gt; &gt;     up the
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; prejudice of hearing plane/travel related words in the 
evp noises.
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; And as you probably know, once that prejudice is active, 
once
&gt; &gt;     I say
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; &quot;Doesn&#x27;t that sound like someone saying
&gt; &gt;     &quot;Sssssstewardesssss...&quot;, then
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; everyone hears THAT word, rather than just noise, or, for 
example
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; &quot;Stewed ass&quot;.
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; And, if something does sound like a plane/travel related 
word, it
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; will now be highlighted as an example of why this was a 
successful
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; test, and the other less-relevant words ignored. This is 
a form of
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; confirmation bias, which again, hurts the value of the 
test.
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; A more objective way would have been to send out both 
crash
&gt; &gt;     related
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; items, and completely innocuous items, with no 
explanation of
&gt; &gt;     where
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; each was from, and see what kind of EVPs were returned on 
each.
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; Further, the returned EVPs should then be returned to 
someone to
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; evaluate who ALSO doesn&#x27;t know the origin of the objects, 
so that
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; they do not torture the interpretations into the forms you
&gt; &gt;     hope and
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; expect them to be (again, plane/travel related). While 
this
&gt; &gt;     test of
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; course lacks all kinds of controls, this would at least 
be a
&gt; &gt;     start to
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; defining a double-blind test, which is the gold standard 
for good
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; research in this kind of research.
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; Even though you have tried to keep some of the 
information quiet,
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; there is still quite a large opportunity for guessing and
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; coincidence. For example, one person might assume this 
was from an
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; airshow (since, as you said, the event was very fast, and 
many
&gt; &gt;     people
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; saw it), and so only send in EVPs that would be relevant 
to that
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; situation (I.e. Not sending in child-like sounds, or 
sending in
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; sounds that sound like scratchy tower or inter-plane
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; communication). If the crash was a commercial airline, 
then dozens
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; of different people could have been killed, which means 
you could
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; find SOME relevancy no matter what noises are returned to 
you:
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; practical any word, name, or sound will support some
&gt; &gt;     speculation that
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; it could have been relevant to one of those people.
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; I do think it is a good idea to test your theories. But 
my purpose
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; here is to suggest ways to help these tests be as 
objective as
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; possible, and for your efforts and testing to be as worth 
while as
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; possible, and for the youtube video results you make to 
be as
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; valuable and bulletproof as possible. But I am concerned 
that the
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; above scenario is full of opportunity for subjectivity and
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt; misinterpretation.
&gt; &gt;     &gt; &gt;
