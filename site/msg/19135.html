<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well I, for one, am glad that you do not drip under pressure Frank (although
I think they have a pill for that)!

You have some interesting stuff posted here and I think that it needs to be
taken into consideration.  There are too many people who are convinced that
everything is a paranormal event.

Like you intimated, most of what we experience is some form of stored
electromagnetic energy.  It builds up and releases in devices like
televisions, refrigerators, light and microwaves.  How often have you heard
your TV make a popping sound when it is off?  We must consider that these
releases of electromagnetic energy travel via waves that can not only
interact  with, but also resonate in wood.  Is it possible that this
frequency resonation can cause a tapping sound once in a while?

I agree fully with the concept of static electricity being responsible for
the willies we get on investigations once in a while.  I am certain that
this is NOT the only cause, but it may play an important role some of the
time.

Show me a picture of an orb and I will show you a picture of a piece of
dust.

But, i am far from a debunking skeptic.  I like to be somewhat rational
before proclaiming that it is a spirit scurrying across the floor in my
attic!  This is why I find GBC so fascinating.  To be able to record the
same voices at different times in different parts of the country is proof
enough for me that there is something fantastic going on with these boxes.
 Whatever is communicating with us is intelligent and responsive, and that
alone should merit further GB research by &quot;science.&quot;

This will not happen though.  The implications of discovering life beyond
our own limited 5 senses are too incomprehensible for the ordered world
science has constructed for us.

There are no experts, only experiences.

&gt;
&gt;   Such as those that think real EVP can only be received using white noise
&gt; might want to do some real research starting with natural radio and what are
&gt; call spherics and whistlers, or pulses generated by lightening and other
&gt; &quot;natural&quot; EMF sources. Some,  will no doubt claim their system operates at
&gt; such a high frequency that it can not get the low frequency EMFs of natural
&gt; radio--wrong again. This stuff covers the whole the spectrum from DC to
&gt; light, and those little whispers are mostly just RF noise from natural and
&gt; man made sources, you can even get the noise from big planets, here on
&gt; Earth, from Jupiter and Saturn.  Get a sound  that might seem like singing
&gt; and I am pretty sure it&#x27;s just what is called a &quot;whistler&quot;, probably from
&gt; terrestrial lightening. The thunderstorm can be anywhere, this stuff
&gt; propagates just like radio, and there are hundreds of thunderstorms all over
&gt; the planet at any given moment.  Everytime an electric motor starts, or a
&gt; florescent light, or a car starts, anything that uses electricity, there is
&gt; going to be a magnetic field radiated.  How many electric lights are in the
&gt; world going on and off!?  How about in a factory, large shop, lab, or
&gt; manufacturing/research facility?Lots and lots of magnetic/electric pulses.
&gt;
&gt;  Then, to make it worse, people claim be touched during investigations
&gt; might want to investigate static electricity!  Clothes generate electric
&gt; fields as we move around, normally it goes unnoticed, but moving around in
&gt; the dark listening and feeling for anything, you might think you&#x27;re being
&gt; touched, or your clothes moved. Could it be just the static electricity
&gt; causing attraction and/or repulsion of areas of clothing?  I&#x27;m not saying
&gt; that&#x27;s what *it is*. Just be sure, and to get the pure experience, I think
&gt; all ghost investigations should be done naked to eliminate all static
&gt; electricity from clothing. :-O
&gt;
&gt;  I know, sounds like debunking, but ya have to stop and think sometimes.
&gt; Some of these effects we feel and hear can be caused by natural magnetic and
&gt; electric sources. Then, make it worse cuz we can create, via thought forms,
&gt; just what we want to experience. One must control one&#x27;s emotions!
&gt;
&gt;  There are some that have established themselves as experts based on white
&gt; noise EVP. To maintain position they may claim only white noise EVP is
&gt; acceptable and pure.  What is white noise? A frikkin&#x27; raw audio in it&#x27;s
&gt; simplest form, so why not use higher level sounds and get higher level
&gt; voices? When you get voices giving names, answering questions, and even
&gt; cussing and swearing, I am pretty sure &quot;the box&quot; as it&#x27;s come to be known
&gt; beats the be-geeesies out of white noise BS. Yes, you can get broadcast
&gt; fragments, and bits that can be mistaken, but with white noise, you can get
&gt; all kinds of weak noise pulses that probably say nothing, but you are
&gt; desperately trying to interpret. It&#x27;s been my experience that the more one
&gt; filters and cleans a recording, the more these noises sound intelligible. If
&gt; you have to filter it just to hear if it is saying anything--forget about
&gt; it!  I think our own minds and psi ability--can--- influence the sounds and
&gt; create a meaning where there was none.
&gt;
&gt;  Spirit exists in a higher dimension, as such they have full access to our
&gt; level and can easily manipulate sound and everything else. We are limited,
&gt; they are not. That&#x27;s why I focus on higher level, more energetic phenomenon
&gt; and ignore stuff like white noise EVP or orbs. Paranormal experience is more
&gt; dictated by what one can accept than anything else,  by what one fears as
&gt; well.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Wait for it! Wait for it! Here it comes-- the threats of law suits and how
&gt; dare you question......
&gt;
&gt;  Am I an expert--hell no, ex===has been, &#x27;spert==drip under pressure. I
