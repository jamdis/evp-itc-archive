Ken Webster�s 1990 book, The Vertical Plane, details some of the hundreds of messages he received on his computer between 1984 and 1985 from Thomas Harden � a sixteenth-century Englishman who once owned Webster�s house in Dodleston, England. The computer was an old word processor with 32 kilobytes of memory and no hard drive, meaning files had to be saved on 5.25-inch floppy disks. What was first dismissed as a prank evolved into Webster�s belief that there was truly something supernatural going on. Webster would come home to find messages on the monitor � or �light box,� as the spirit of Harden referred to the machine. In these communications, Harden wrote in an old English dialect and stated that Webster was living in his house. \n\nAround this time, other ITC explorers were experimenting with ideas such as filming feedback loops on televisions. This is done by taking a video camera, plugging it into a television so the television is showing what the camera sees, and then pointing the camera at the television, which causes video feedback � a series of jumping frames, static that fades in and out, and seemingly random patterns that form the visual �noise.� This feedback is then recorded. During playback, especially at slow speeds or when viewing the images frame-by-frame, some researchers have found that the patterns become recognizable � sometimes human shapes form, and in the most profound cases, the human is instantly recognizable as someone the researcher knew in life.\n\n....&quot;\n\r\n--0-1567766543-1177110848=:22284\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;in the feedback video mentioned below, sometimes the ghost pic will be on ONE FRAME ONLY and will be missing on preceding, succeeding frame&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.ghostvillage.com/legends/2006/legends46_11162006.shtml&quot;&gt;http://www.ghostvillage.com/legends/2006/legends46_11162006.shtml&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&quot;...In 1984, spirit messages apparently began appearing on computer screens.
