There is a word between &quot;Listen&quot; and &quot;It&quot;, the word is unclear but it is two syllables and has a &quot;K&quot; sound in the middle of it.\n\nYour second clip, I hear what you hear.  After the &quot;hi Steve&quot;, there is a woman singing.  It sounds like she is saying &quot;Don&#39;t fear.&quot;\n\nAnd I don&#39;t think there is any question about the content of your third clip.\n\nTim\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, urkel23@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; These are from an 8 minute session i did this morning.  Let me know if  you \n&gt; guys hear them.  I&#39;m running on not much sleep the past couple  days.
