Carradine's body was discovered in a ho=
tel suite and local  reports 
suggested he committed suicide. 

He was disc=
overed by a maid,  naked and hanged, but the suggestions his 
death had a s=
exual twist were  strongly disputed by the star's close friend, 
attorney V=
icki Roberts, and his  manager Chuck Binder, who insisted he died of 
natur=
al causes. 

But a  statement from Carradine's representative now indicates=
 the actor 
died during  a sex act.

The spokesperson tells TMZ.com, "We ca=
n confirm 100 percent  that he never 
would have committed suicide. It was =
an accidental death.  Everybody is in 
shock."

Carradine was in Thailand to shoot the movi=
