<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rees.  I&#x27;m at http://www.ITCdeadpeople.com

It&#x27;s a super simple site.  Just five pages.  But page one has a link to some of my EVP which I 
posted on putfile.  And page two has several links:  one for instructions on the water video 
ITC technique, one to a Maury segment on youtube where some of my material was used 
(thanks for posting that, Debbie!), and a couple collages of the crystal images.

I hope you like it.  

Margaret

&gt;           Hi Misty. I was surprised at how much smaller my files became when I changed 
my 
&gt; settings in Audacity to 16-bit MONO with an 11025Hz sample rate. I figure this is voice 
&gt; we are recording, not the symphony. And in my case, I&#x27;m not doing any kind of 
frequency 
&gt; analysis, or anything else that requires super high quality files. Files, in almost all cases, 
&gt; really do not need to be 32-bit stereo with a 44100Hz sample rate. But I know how 
hard 
&gt; it can be to convince some people of this.
&gt; 
&gt; I do save my individual raw files on my drive in WAV format. But if I&#x27;m going to post, I 
&gt; create an MP3. Even my WAV files are small though. Just took a look, and with my 
&gt; settings, a short WAV file runs about 88kb. Converted to MP3 it becomes just 16kb. I 
&gt; have one that is 248kb in the raw, but after editing out unrelated content and exporting 
to 
&gt; MP3, it was just 24kb. 
&gt; 
&gt; If people would just record with the lower settings to begin with, I think they would be 
&gt; surprised at the amount of quality which remains... not to discount how much of their 
own 
&gt; hard drive space will be saved. I know a 1MB WAV file with the high settings becomes 
just 
&gt; 20kb in MP3 format with the lower settings. 
&gt; 
&gt; I visit another forum where the max file size for a single submission is 150kb. A person 
is 
&gt; physically unable to upload any file larger than that. People have changed to the lower 
&gt; settings in order to meet the file size restriction, and I can tell you that plenty of 
members 
&gt; post, and plenty of others hear and understand their examples just fine. Hopefully some 
of 
&gt; the members here will give the lower settings a try. :0)

&gt; &gt; You guys really do have to start using mp3 versions tho we are at 90% full again so its 
&gt; going to come down to either some people wont be allowed to post files if they cant 
make 
&gt; the transition, or all files will have to be deleted, or nobody will be able to post at all 
&gt; because there will be no space left.
