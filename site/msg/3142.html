<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was at The Stanley Hotel in Colorado last weekend, and was excited to
get to work with the new Mini-Box built by Ron Ricketts.   I was also
happy to meet Frank for the first time!   I had several sessions with
the Mini-Box with April and Allen Slaughter of the Association for the
Study of Unexplained Phenomena, and found it quite impressive.  Very
compact, long battery life (and rechargeable) and good clarity.  &quot;Seven&quot;
came through for me in every session.  We had a session with Mark Macy,
and a short one with Frank -- wish it could have been longer.  I&#x27;m
getting one of the first of these boxes, and it will be a valuable
addition to the two Frank&#x27;s Boxes that I&#x27;m working with.

I haven&#x27;t reviewed the recordings yet, as I just got home.  But we got
many clear responses to questions.
