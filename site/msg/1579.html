<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Frank and everyone--if you can both place things in folders and e- 
mail them that would be best for me, at least. It&#x27;s far easier for me  
to get to them if they come attached. Is anyone else unable to get  
the attachments if their group setting is on individual e-mails? I  
know it could be a pain in the --- to do both, and if a lot of people  
are having problems then I shouldn&#x27;t ask, but.... well, I&#x27;ll quite  
babbling now. ;)
