<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Build a box, do some experimenting and find out for yourself. It what we
have been discussing here works for you, great. If it doesn&#x27;t, great. That;s
the only way you&#x27;ll find out.

Heck, get yourself a pocket digital voice recorder and go to some place near
you that&#x27;s supposed to be haunted. Try to get some EVP. You might get
nothing and you might get surprised.
A friend recently sent me some audio recordings to listen to. They were made
on a pocket DVR. Both were made in places where she was the only person for
miles (except one where her husband was about 1000 feet away in a car) and
the places were quiet. There was no power in these places, no nearby radio
stations. Both recordings contained quite a number of EVP voices that I
could hear.

&gt; I am not in denial of anything, and if it is real I very much want to learn
