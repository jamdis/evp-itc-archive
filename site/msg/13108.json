Transistor junctions \nand diodes do this well.  Fortunately (for us), the devices used at audio \nfrequencies have a limited frequency range where they would do anything. A \nsignal at an AM frequency is most likely to interact and possibly an FM \nfrequency signal will interact. UHF and microwave signals are probably out \nof the range where these devices will do anything.\n\nTry to get diodes that work at millimeter-wave frequencies!  They are \ndifficult to find and rather expensive. $50 - $100 for one diode is not \nuncommon.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Mon, 15 Dec 2008, don powell wrote:\n\n&gt; AM is the kicker.� With amplitude modulation, and high power (being close to the tower) any device will pick up those voices.\n&gt;\n&gt; AM basically is the same as real speech except that the carrier is not air but a relatively high frequency EMF.� FM does not have this problem because the words and music are created by varying the frequency and not the amplitude.� (a primer for those not into the geeky side of radio)\n&gt;\n&gt; Don\n&gt;\r\n--297796611-1349204664-1229354332=:16055--"}
