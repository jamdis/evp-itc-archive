<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s probably not kosher to post this, but I find this highly insulting to
all of us. As usual, igonore all facts and all other methods, such as
EVPmaker, which forms all the voices inside the computer. Ignore all phone
EVP messages, ignore all voices heard with no electronic aids. Ignore
messages received via turned off TV and printers--and on and on, yet they
know all about EVP..Ignore the fact that probably thousands use boxes
successfully.

&quot;We have conducted a few listening studies of reported radio-sweep EVP and
the results have not been good. We have also worked with a variety of such
devices. Based on what we know about trans-etheric influences, how EVP and
visual forms of ITC are formed and what we know about mediumship, it is
difficult to fit radio-sweep into any established hypothesis. Without solid
research supporting it as producing EVP, it is impossible for us to
recommend it or support its use. If there were double-blind studies
conducted by experienced researchers that shows it does produce phenomena,
we would gladly promote it as an alternative technique.

We are pretty sure that, in transform EVP (ordinary recorder), the voice is
formed in the electronics by transforming available audio-frequency noise in
an active part of the electronics such as a transistor junction. We think
the process is amplification of a weak telekinetic signal via stochastic
resonance and we have found that the optimum audio-frequency signal for this
is a chaotic one rich in voice-frequencies with many transient perturbation.
That is our working hypothesis. &quot;

 I can&#x27;t say who this is from, cuz almost certain I&#x27;d get sued. There&#x27;s no
double blind testing their BS either. Clueless!!

&gt; When people start calling themselves experts at something that is not or
&gt; may never be fully understood the crap gets deep. I love these so called
&gt; experts that tell us that we can only make contact using their exact methods
&gt; and we need to refrain from any other way of doing research because in their
&gt; eyes were just spinning our wheels. So we can&#x27;t get communication from
&gt; modified radios and were all just hearing what we want I guess. I have heard
&gt; it all,,&quot;I wrote a book and im an expert&quot; or &quot;believe me that wont work, I
&gt; know cause im physic&quot;….in one ear and out the other. Everyone is an expert
&gt; these days and most of what they say is BS. If I start hearing someone or
&gt; something talking through my dogs butt guess what im recording it.
&gt;
&gt; Sounds like these so called experts are just trying to deter and silence
&gt; anything they dont agree with by doing there Scientific tests. If it works
&gt; it works and if it didnt work what the hell are we all still doing here.

&gt; Thousands
&gt; &gt; of box users and experiencers are either lying or insane!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Pseudo scientific BS! Their testing reveals exactly what they expectt,
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; is the nature of the paranormal. Getting the results they wanted, they
&gt; puff
&gt; &gt; out their chests and proclaim yet another victory for science! Science
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; a habit of supplying exactly the results wanted by whoever is paying for
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; tests..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; First, where do they find people that are somehow qualified listeners!?
&gt; WTF
&gt; &gt; is that S---!? It&#x27;s BS, and they know it. Same old skeptic/science crap,
&gt; &gt; except from a group that wants to be the worlds onlyest EVP authority.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m sure there will be articles in major paranormal mags proclaiming how
&gt; &gt; the experts thoroughly debunked the boxes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; They keep testing and getting nothing, and the rest of us keep recording
&gt; &gt; and have no shortage of voices that others can hear, can be validated,
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; gives infromation that&#x27;s unknow to the listener. I just posted a video
&gt; where
&gt; &gt; a voice says &quot;I said fuck&quot; just to show it&#x27;s not broadcast frags. This
&gt; stuff
&gt; &gt; conveniently ignored. I&#x27;ve been kicked off groups for getting voices
&gt; thast
&gt; &gt; somehow were judged not ghostly enough, cuz all the experts know ghosts
&gt; &gt; can&#x27;t cuss, they can barely even talk and communcate!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; They send me their stupid results thinking I&#x27;m the one out there pushing
&gt; &gt; boxes. Ignorant dorks, it&#x27;s the results pushing boxes!
