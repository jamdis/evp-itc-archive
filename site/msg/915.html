<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>thats always a factor.  among other things its related to jupiter 
changing direction as seen from earth.

this applies only to north america and to a lesser degree 
siberia,tibet,nepal- ie,centered on 90 w longitude, 90 e longitude.

some ghost voices are definitely living people who are not completely 
aware that they are projecting &quot;something&quot; into the ethers.

using diode method, voices can be heard actually assembling themselves 
from static caused by lightning discharges

the rotation of jupiters 4 largest moons and the position of jupiter 
relative to the galactic center and anticenter (the milky way is 
actually the plane of our galaxy seen edge on) also have an effect.

in 1966 i was operating a small am station in kirkland ,illinois and was 
striving for static free bcb/am radio transmission and reception.  i got 
more than i bargained for.  strange-but generally harmless- entities 
started being reported in local papers.  glowing meadows, panicked 
livestock, migrating snakes coming together in huge confabs, ruined 
photo-film, changed behavior of microorganisms for instance those that 
cause mildew., unusual meteors.

all the UFO associated stuff.

most of the phenomena seem to be inherently destructive-at best , 
neutral- but there is a resplendent residue of something way way beyond 
our present capacity to imagine which is also positive.</pre>
