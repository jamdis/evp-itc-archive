interesting.....
when i tried to talk 'potty-mouth Dave' over to the other =
side....for some reason my very expensive brand new ( 2 week old) smoke ala=
rm that had never had any issues to that point- suddenly started goin off l=
ike crazy ( there was neither smoke, steam,=A0nor fire by the way)
and i en=
ded up having to remove the (brand new) battery to stop it...... every time=
 after that that i tried the bateries again, it did same. manufactures inst=
ructions said a low batt. will cause an 'intermitten beep'=A0 but this was =
full scale alarm, not beep. far as i see it- the unit is fried.
anyone had =
sometihg like this happen?

Well, first=
