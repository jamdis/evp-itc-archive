I wouldn&#x27;t argue with you in the slightest for filing a lawsuit, when 
and if you have grounds for it. 

Yet, does the field really need that sort of press?

&gt;  Interesting. This is the &quot;eveidence&quot; I usaully don&#x27;t get to see 
and hear. All I usually hear is someone saying how every other 
researcher in the world gets nothing, he is the only one that gets 
the valid communucation, which personally I find highly insulting. 
&gt;  
&gt;  One fact is, I did not make a &quot;telephone to dead&quot;, I don&#x27;t know 
what the f--- that is, and I don&#x27;t endorse it! Nor do I appreciate my 
name being connected to the so called &quot;Telephone to dead&quot; on every 
friggin&#x27; ad for Moon&#x27;s public appearances. I just make the boxes, I&#x27;m 
not someone&#x27;s lacky.

&gt; Thank you for this post. it was an amazing life altering 
experiencefor all. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, lisby@ wrote:&gt;&gt; 
Frank--I have listened to this APSR broadcast and was 
incrediblyimpressed with what occurred at this event. Chris&#x27;s box is 
quitecapable of behaving like John Edward--directly bringing 
relationsthrough to talk to those who need to hear them. Some of the 
responseswere astoundingly clear and loud. It certainly sounded 
similar to whatI have heard of what Bruce is getting, and honestly, 
it is exactlywhat I hope to get with my box when I receive it.&gt; &gt; If 
you haven&#x27;t listened to this, you really should. I think Chrismade 
his usual statements about Edison and the 30, but aside fromthat, 
this was a wonderful session and people were extremely moved.&gt; &gt; If 
you want, I&#x27;ll find the URL.&gt; &gt; Ann&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----

is only one box user allowed!?&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Christopher was immediately 
taken by what he had seen and heard.He was able to &gt; make a direct 
connection with spirits. inhabitants,victims, participants, and &gt; 
witnesses...describing amazing events andeven some unspeakable acts 
that had &gt; happened within the walls ofthese notoriously haunted 
places. The details &gt; afforded by thesespirits gave answers to 
lingering questions that could not &gt; have comefrom anyone but the 
parties involved. Already amazed by the &gt;instrument&#x27;s ability to 
connect with these historical figures,Christopher soon &gt; realized 
that other entities were trying to reachout as well. Deceased 
fathers, &gt; sons, mothers, daughters, and friendsof session 
participants were sending &gt; messages through the device.Talk of this 
spread, and last year, at the Ghost &gt; Chaser&#x27;s WeekendConference in 
Savannah, Georgia, Christopher was asked to do a &gt;presentation about 
his research with the Telephone to the Dead. Thisquickly &gt; turned 
into an impromtu public demonstration, withparticipants, one by one, 
&gt; coming forward requesting to speak withloved ones who had died. 
Surprisingly, &gt; even to Christopher, theserequests were met with 
comforting and sometimes vital &gt; messages. Thepresentation was 
recorded and broadcasted by A.P.S.R. Radio.&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From a recent add 
for another presentation, but apparently therest of us get nothing 
like this, so it doesn&#x27;t even work for us.Guess I&#x27;ll just go back to 
killing time wth Ham radio, and quitwasting all my time and money on 
useless boxes. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Curious that no one else gets any &quot;real&quot; 
contacts--event the socalled box inventor gets nothing.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
