Carradine Death Was  Accidental

IMDb, J=
une 4,  2009

David Carradine died during a sex game that went  wrong, acco=
rding to 
sources in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was found  dead on Thursda=
y.

Carradine's body was discovered in a hotel  suite and local reports 
su=
ggested he committed suicide. 

He  was discovered by a maid, naked and han=
ged, but the suggestions his  
death had a sexual twist were strongly dispu=
ted by the star's close  friend, 
attorney Vicki Roberts, and his manager C=
huck Binder, who  insisted he died 
of natural causes. 

But a statement fr=
om  Carradine's representative now indicates the actor 
died during a sex  =
act.

The spokesperson tells TMZ.com, "We can confirm 100  percent that he =
never 
would have committed suicide. It was an  accidental death. Everybody=
 is in 
shock." 

Rumours Carradine  died attempting auto-erotic asphyxiati=
on- -where victims 
achieve  heightened sexual pleasure by restricting thei=
r air supply are  
backed up by a quote a Bangkok police officer gave to Br=
itish  newspaper The 
Sun. 

The cop tells reporters, "A rope was  attached=
 to his neck and also to his 
penis". 

Rocker Michael  Hutchence was rumou=
red to have died attempting the same sex 
act in a  Sydney, Australia, hote=
l room back in 1997--although his death 
was  officially declared a suicide=
.

Carradine was in Thailand to  shoot the movie "Stretch." He was 72.
