We were at a fairly famous\ninvestigation spot.  The group before us were &quot;releasing&quot; the spirits. \nFunny how we got soooo many evp&#39;s just a few minutes after the spirits\nwere &quot;helped&quot; by this group.  Leads me to feel that we are just making\nourselves feel good about ourselves for &quot;helping&quot; them over.  I don&#39;t\nthink we can help a lot of those spirits.  They are there for a\nreason...they need to work out some sort of karma...and when that\nhappens...they can continue.\n\nI&#39;m just saying,\nCarol B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Well, everything is done for a reason, I believe this gift of\n&gt; communication\n&gt;  has been given to us for a reason, not just to sell tickets, but to help\n&gt; ourselves still in the world, by moving those other&#39;s on, we in a sense\n&gt; move ourselves on to better and higher vibration.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; In a message dated 5/27/2009 6:18:50 P.M.

The\n&gt; trouble with doing investigations, I think, is you get  the evidence you\n&gt; expect\n&gt; to get, so it will tend to support the concept of  stuck souls. When I\n&gt; record\n&gt; it supports my concept of sprits travel, and  hauntings are for show.\n&gt; Which\n&gt; is correct?--both at one time or another.\n&gt;\n&gt; I did a recording at lunch time, at home, and in it a voice says\n&gt; &quot;ghost--right behind you&quot;.

After my\n&gt; demonstration, another group that was also there started complaining  that\n&gt; the box made\n&gt; too much noise and was hendering their investigation  so I turned it off.\n&gt; I\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t want my direct communication with  the deceased inmates to mess\n&gt; up\n&gt; their EVP work, now would I? I  apoligized and put it away for the rest of\n&gt; the night.\n&gt;  According to the prison staff, the inmates firmly believed  that if they\n&gt; died in prison their souls would be forever trapped  there. This belief\n&gt; was\n&gt; so strong that the prison officials would take  the elderly inmates who\n&gt; were\n&gt; dying of natural causes  to a local hospital so they would&#39;nt have to die\n&gt; in\n&gt; the  prison. Maybe their beliefs were well founded.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________\n&gt;  From: &quot;SnowfireL@aol.  com&quot; &lt;SnowfireL@aol. com&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To:  EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 27, 2009  12:36:12 PM\n&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Ghost Box  Demo at Moundsville WV\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a wonderful recording, were  you able to free any of them?  So sad\n&gt; to see them still there  behind bars, must be very lonely for them, they\n&gt; should be moving on  so, they can start to work on making up for things on\n&gt; the\n&gt; other  side.  You folks should go up there again, and hold a small  prayer\n&gt; vigil for them, of course they would no longer be ghosts  trapped there,\n&gt; but\n&gt; there are plenty more around.  sf\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; In a message dated 5/27/2009 12:10:56 P.M.

Deep inside the  prison surrounded by concrete and\n&gt; steel,\n&gt; the radio could not pick up  any radio stations in manual mode. I wasn&#39;t\n&gt; sure how this might  effect the demonstration.
