The one on EVPS: (\n&gt; http://www.hauntedamericatours.com/EVP/EVP/) does show her presumptions,\n&gt; and she  presents many of the issues and potentials for &quot;false positives&quot;\n&gt; that I assume all experienced EVP researchers already know of.   But she\n&gt; also comments to the claims: &quot;My response to this is…provide the evidence! &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; So that would seem to me she would be open to a well-designed test to &quot;show\n&gt; her the evidence&quot;.  So I will contact her, suggest this sort of test, and\n&gt; even suggest that experts from this group would help to design and conduct\n&gt; the test - maybe even Frank - and let you know what she says.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Thu, 12/31/09, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Zack Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@gmail.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Big Mistake!\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, December 31, 2009, 11:43 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nothing.

I thought she was\n&gt;&gt; someone off the group and has an interest in EVP and the boxes. She did\n&gt;&gt; mention she was a skeptic, but I didn&#39;t think debunker, or a professional\n&gt;&gt; skeptic--wonder who pays these twits?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  These skeptics don&#39;t allow themselves to hear anything, yet will proclaim\n&gt;&gt; that as proof the boxes and EVP don&#39;t work, as if their hearing is somehow\n&gt;&gt; better than the average persons ear. If a person doesn&#39;t want to hear it,\n&gt;&gt; they won&#39;t, and because they can&#39;&#39;t hear EVP that means no one else an\n&gt;&gt; either.
