Perhaps thats a good thing, as the tuning likely becomes under the control of the person&#39;s subconscious much like a Ouija board and possibly allows entities to better manipulate the tuning of required fragments? \nLinear or random electronic tuning doesnt have that direct human interaction .... but can it be tied in somehow? \nJEFF\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  See, not a box, or even a hack radio, just a cheap little FM radio. No magic, no mystery, but mucho fun! You can ask questions, and get all the box function--no box! I just can&#39;t in all honesty sell something that&#39;s just a damn radio with automated sweep. I mean i could probably sell it for what it is, but not for mega bucks, or try to over glorify it like all the wanna be box experts out there. It&#39;s just one method of many of supplying raw audio. \n&gt; \n&gt;  BTW, Misty pretty much discovered manual sweep here, on this group! \n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
