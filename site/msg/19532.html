<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I know what you mean. I just had to return a pedometer for lack of doing research first. The stupid thing kept resetting itself throughout the day. I looked up reveiews because it was doing that to me, and it turns out that was a common problem with that brand.

With bigger purchases I do research first, not after like the pedometer. Lol!
