There are many programs to compare files, but you have to be =\r\ncareful not to use one that does a line-by-line compare (or a comparison me=\r\nant for text files), since text files can be different at a low level, but =\r\nlook essential the same in an editor (because of the way spaces and tabs an=\r\nd new lines work between editors and platforms).\n\n                  But any=\r\nway, the way to compare is with a program that can compare binary files, no=\r\nt text files.\n\n\n                  --- On Sun, 5/10/09, April Abercrombie &lt;a=\r\npril@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n                    From: Apr=\r\nil Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt;\n                    S=\r\nubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules-ATTENTION JON\n                  =\r\n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n                    Date: Sunday, May 10, 20=\r\n09, 2:42 PM\n\n\n\n                    So if the number of bytes match then the=\r\ny are the same bytes?

In video processing, this would result in a field of mult=\r\ni-colored flowers being replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish blo=\r\nck, with no resemblance to flowers.

Taking something as complex as speech, =\r\nand replacing frequencies with their averages, loses the speech the farther=\r\n you go, until you head strange fluctuating square waves.  Doing the same t=\r\no random static will eventually produce the same thing.  And random fluctua=\r\nting square waves can sound a bit like speech - or at least, you could have=\r\n fun sharing with each other what you thing they &#39;sound like&#39;.\n\n\n\n\n\n       =\r\n                         --- On Sun, 5/10/09, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yaho=\r\no.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n                                From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbab=\r\nea@ yahoo.com&gt;\n                                Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File =\r\nuploading rules\n                                To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .co=\r\nm\n                                Date: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 9:29 AM\n\n\n   =\r\n                             I always save the whole file in wav format the=\r\nn do my clips as mp3.

This may not be a big deal in music, where the a=\r\nudio is fairly clear to begin with.  But with sound sources with a lot of n=\r\noise (like evps), this can not only obscure any real sounds, but pixelize n=\r\non-sounds (like white noise) and make them start to sound like speech.\n\n   =\r\n                             So mp3 might be good for sharing the data, onc=\r\ne you&#39;ve already formed an opinion based on an analysis of the wav file.  B=\r\nut mp3 is not good as a medium for analysis.
