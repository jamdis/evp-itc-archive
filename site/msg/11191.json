A few prefer one over another and have no problem telling you this is great or this sucks. For instance some feel musical notes are too loud for them to be heard over the noise, while others have no problems being louder and think its working great. I never get any complaints using water I dont know why. \n\nOverall I mostly get the same base group no matter what method I am trying as well as many strangers who drop in to comment or say hello. \n\nMisty\n\n--- On Tue, 6/3/08, alofbama@... &lt;alofbama@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: alofbama@... &lt;alofbama@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Misty, water sounds\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, June 3, 2008, 2:20 PM\n&gt; I think you&#39;re onto something exciting and that needs to\n&gt; be researched by many others.
