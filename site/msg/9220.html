I don't have the previous messages about esnips but I now have a membership and file there.  My question to anyone here is "how do I use esnips with this group."  What I wanted to do is save a two minute evp session on esnips and then make it available to others.  Anyone know how to best do this, let me know.  I guess the way this would be used is to post the esnips dot com web site in my email message and the reader would need to click on esnips and then go to my site to look up the file...something like we do with our files here.  If you know another application please let me know.  Anyway, if you want you can check it out here by clicking here and see how it works.  www.esnips.com
