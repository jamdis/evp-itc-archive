Well, the point of it really is that manual sweep does work, even with
this=
 old radio. My hubby was a little reluctant to let me use it, but
I'm cute,=
 what can I say? As far as the speed goes, I was turning it as
fast as I co=
uld, but it was a little tight. I guess it needs some WD40. 
[:D]

At :45 I=
 hear "Do you compute, McPhereson." and then a man answers "Yes"
pretty cle=
arly. I had told "them" that I was testing out this radio and
that they sho=
uld talk, so maybe they were testing it, too.  [;)]
