  April,

  What y=
our saying is that the entity should be questioned and then the veracity of=
 their statements need to be proven before one believes that the communicat=
ion that is being passed to you is accurate. This means that their statemen=
ts must be veridical. This is the same path that I chose when I was develop=
ing as a medium. It works...but it takes a lot of time and effort on everyo=
ne's part. 

  Great ideas, April!!

 it hasn't, then the experiment stops there, at least with that entity.

      Well, if my husband would let me actually experiment wi=
th one, that would be the first step LOL!

      But what I would try and d=
o is get some kind of verifiable information from the "entity" that I conta=
ct with the board to prove that it is communication from an actual, intelli=
gent being and not just my own motor responses making he planchette move. I=
t would have to be information that I have no knowledge of.

      If I cou=
ld do that, and consistently, then I would be comfortable saying that I am =
actually talking to a spirit.

      The reason I have my doubts is that yo=
u have to be touching the planchette to get it to move. If it were an actua=
l spirit, I would think that shouldn't be necessary. We all know ghosts can=
 a do move objects.

      But this brings up another mystery - if the Ouij=
a board is actual spirit communication, maybe there is a difference between=
 the entities you can contact with it and your common ghost.

        .


   =
     When it comes to the Ouija, I just want to study it to find out if it =
is really spirit communication, or just kinetic energy or your subconscious=
 mind moving the planchette.

        I agree that we all have the ability =
for extra sensory perception, just some are better at it than others. Like =
running, for instance. We all can run, but some are naturally better at it.=
 Still, with practice we can get better.

        But that is not my aim wi=
th the Ouija.
