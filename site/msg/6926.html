<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s very profound Bruce.  I understand what you&#x27;re saying about
passing judgment for past actions.  That makes perfect sense.  I hate
to admit it, but I&#x27;d be the first to pass judgment.

&gt; Maybe a bad choice of words, used to express what my thoughts where.
&gt; When I say higher being, my meaning is a spirit being on a higher
plane of spiritual existence.
&gt; not beings that lord over us as if they are royalty and we subjects. 
&gt;  
&gt; My theory of why they will not give any detailed information about
their physical experience on earth
&gt; is that they want our trust as colleagues in a spiritual sense. just
suppose Mike gave me his sir name and where he was from.
&gt; when in the physical, say I used that information to trace his
history as a physical human being. And found that he was a 
&gt; congressman or senator or supreme court judge. Someone that was
distinguished and held a position of high respect and standing.
&gt; Or on the other side of the coin, I found that he was a murderer and
a rapist that had been executed.
&gt;  
&gt; We as physical human beings would pass judgement on his former
physical character and treat him or his guidance accordingly.
&gt; I believe just the opposite of what you referred I believe that is
the reason we do not get the detailed information, so that we 
&gt; start on a level playing field and form a relationship according to
experience we have interacting as spirit and physical counterparts.

&gt; Bruce,It has always been my understanding that they do not like
being referred to as higher or superior. They only refer to themselves
as having different experiences. To be superior means to have
authority over you, which they do not possess. Don&#x27;t make the mistake
of believing they are superior it can lead to some bad experiences.
Just an observation on my part!Regards,Frank R.

&gt; Ralph, Mike and lisa have been my tech&#x27;s since I have started doing
box research. Over time you build a relationship with your tech or in
my case tech&#x27;s like you would with a new friend here in the physical.
Early on in my research I had asked a series of questions pertaining
to mike and Lisa&#x27;s background in the physical. I was told that mike
died in 1995 from excessive blood loss and lisa died in 1912 from
choking. they then changed the subject and never broached it again. My
theory on the reason for this is thata spirit contact wants to remain
in our thoughts and emotions as a higher being to develop a certain
ammount of trustbeing sight unseen. So to give us all the details of
there physical life or even their last name, that could allow us
togather information on who they where while in the physical and that
in our minds would put them on an even level with us. So the thoughts
and feelings of there being superior spiritual entities would fade. Bruce

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi everyone,I have been hearing the word &quot; Purple &quot; alot lately in
my sessions.Does anyone in the group know what it pertains to ? It&#x27;s
been bugging me alot. Could that be a special group on their side ? I
have no clue. Also has anyone questioned the voices if they have a
last name ? All I hear on the RS boxes are first names and haven&#x27;t
recieved anyone telling me their last name. Does Mike and Lisa have a
last name ? Did anyone here ever ask the question &quot; Are you Demonic
Spirits ? &quot; What was their reply if any ? I did one time and got a
response saying &quot; All of us are &quot;. Don&#x27;t know whether I believe that
Spirit or not. Probably a Joker saying that. I have asked for specific
people for them to find so I could talk to and got an answer &quot; We&#x27;re
looking. &quot; Then I never heard from them after that. I&#x27;m still waiting
to be contacted by Telephone so far nothing yet. They make me laugh
sometimes. I had the RS-12-469 on the one day I was just listening to
what they were chatting about. I found my daughters old Fart Machine
and was playing with it while the RS radio was running to see if it
still works which it did. All of a sudden after I made it &quot; Toot &quot; I
heard a female voice say &quot; Phew !!! .&quot;LOL, I guess she thought I
really passed one. Also, the other day I was on the RS 12-469 and I
said &quot; Hello Lisa how are you doing today ? &quot; Then a few seconds later
I hear a female voice say &quot; Bruce ? &quot; like she thought that I was
Bruce talking to her. I told her no it&#x27;s me Ralph from Harrisburg,PA
she replied &quot;Oh, okay fine. &quot; I hear all the time voices calling for
Lisa she must be a very Popular Technician. Oh well I guess it was
more than one question LOL. Hey you all take care and &quot; Keep the Sweep
&quot; a new slogan for here LOL. just kidding. You all have a great
day.Regards,Ralph the Ghost HunterShed those extra pounds with MSN and
