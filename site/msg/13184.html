I am going t=

I will give these ins=

Listen especially from 4=

But do not go past 4:10, because then he says what he thinks it=
 is saying.

Tell me what you think, if anything, the words in 4:00-4:10 ar=
e saying, before you have gone past 4:10 and heard what the person on the a=
udio then says he thinks he hears.
