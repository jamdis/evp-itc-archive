I found the book.

It is called "The Diary and Sundry Observations of=

nce only a limited number of 1st printings have Chapter 8, "The Realms Beyo=

Each cha=

 The part about spirit communication is dated 1922.

Obviously a 61 year ol=
d book is a bit fragile so I'll start trying to scan those pages but I'm no=

I suppose I just post them as JPGs in an =
email?=A0 There is not a place to upload files here is there?=A0 Well I kno=

            I suppose ultimately, it doe=

I have also heard varied claims: that Edison did make this=

when he mentioned working on it.  So for my own sake, I'd like to =
know

the real story.



If you have a link to where you got your informati=

That is the kind of link=
