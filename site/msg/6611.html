<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The first repetition of the clip *is* the raw audio. Not speeded up  
or slowed. As it was recorded. No amplifying, no noise reduction.  
That is exactly how it came across. The second rep is 25 percent  
slowed and the 3rd is 50 percent slowed.

What you&#x27;re hearing is exactly what happened.

&gt; Ann,
&gt;                 I heard box in there somewhere.  What do the files  
&gt; sound like raw?  I think by slowing them down your losing the clear  
&gt; responses.  Can you post one of the raw clips?  Don&#x27;t worry about  
&gt; slowing it down or editing it.  I think your getting some great  
&gt; stuff, but its distored by the editing software.
