{"id": "19133", "subject": "For the &quot;pure EVP&quot; enthusiast", "author": "Frank Sumption", "timestamp": "2010-11-02T15:30:36Z", "full_text": "Such as those that think real EVP can only be received using white noise\nmight want to do some real research starting with natural radio and what are\ncall spherics and whistlers, or pulses generated by lightening and other\n&quot;natural&quot; EMF sources. Some,  will no doubt claim their system operates at\nsuch a high frequency that it can not get the low frequency EMFs of natural\nradio--wrong again. This stuff covers the whole the spectrum from DC to\nlight, and those little whispers are mostly just RF noise from natural and\nman made sources, you can even get the noise from big planets, here on\nEarth, from Jupiter and Saturn.  Get a sound  that might seem like singing\nand I am pretty sure it&#39;s just what is called a &quot;whistler&quot;, probably from\nterrestrial lightening. The thunderstorm can be anywhere, this stuff\npropagates just like radio, and there are hundreds of thunderstorms all over\nthe planet at any given moment.  Everytime an electric motor starts, or a\nflorescent light, or a car starts, anything that uses electricity, there is\ngoing to be a magnetic field radiated.  How many electric lights are in the\nworld going on and off!?  How about in a factory, large shop, lab, or\nmanufacturing/research facility?Lots and lots of magnetic/electric pulses.\n\n Then, to make it worse, people claim be touched during investigations might\nwant to investigate static electricity!  Clothes generate electric fields as\nwe move around, normally it goes unnoticed, but moving around in the dark\nlistening and feeling for anything, you might think you&#39;re being touched, or\nyour clothes moved. Could it be just the static electricity causing\nattraction and/or repulsion of areas of clothing?  I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s\nwhat *it is*. Just be sure, and to get the pure experience, I think all\nghost investigations should be done naked to eliminate all static\nelectricity from clothing. :-O\n\n I know, sounds like debunking, but ya have to stop and think sometimes.\nSome of these effects we feel and hear can be caused by natural magnetic and\nelectric sources. Then, make it worse cuz we can create, via thought forms,\njust what we want to experience. One must control one&#39;s emotions!\n\n There are some that have established themselves as experts based on white\nnoise EVP. To maintain position they may claim only white noise EVP is\nacceptable and pure.  What is white noise? A frikkin&#39; raw audio in it&#39;s\nsimplest form, so why not use higher level sounds and get higher level\nvoices? When you get voices giving names, answering questions, and even\ncussing and swearing, I am pretty sure &quot;the box&quot; as it&#39;s come to be known\nbeats the be-geeesies out of white noise BS. Yes, you can get broadcast\nfragments, and bits that can be mistaken, but with white noise, you can get\nall kinds of weak noise pulses that probably say nothing, but you are\ndesperately trying to interpret. It&#39;s been my experience that the more one\nfilters and cleans a recording, the more these noises sound intelligible. If\nyou have to filter it just to hear if it is saying anything--forget about\nit!  I think our own minds and psi ability--can--- influence the sounds and\ncreate a meaning where there was none.\n\n Spirit exists in a higher dimension, as such they have full access to our\nlevel and can easily manipulate sound and everything else. We are limited,\nthey are not. That&#39;s why I focus on higher level, more energetic phenomenon\nand ignore stuff like white noise EVP or orbs. Paranormal experience is more\ndictated by what one can accept than anything else,  by what one fears as\nwell.\n\n\n Wait for it! Wait for it! Here it comes-- the threats of law suits and how\ndare you question......\n\n Am I an expert--hell no, ex===has been, &#39;spert==drip under pressure. I\ndon&#39;t want to be a &quot;paranormal expert&quot;\n\n\n F-S\n\nSuch as hose ha hink eal EVP can only be ecei ed using whi e noise migh wan o do some eal esea ch s a ing wi h na u al adio and wha a e call sphe ics and whis le s, o pulses gene a ed by ligh ening and o he \"na u al\" EMF sou ces.
