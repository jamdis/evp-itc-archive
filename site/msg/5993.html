<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Juli--I think these are fabulous. It is amazing how &quot;creative&quot; they  
get with the radio fragments--almost mischievous. ;) I hear each  
clearly and as you do.

&gt; Guys,
&gt; I just posted several files from a joint session this weekend in
&gt; Kentucky. I would appreciate the imput from those who are serious
&gt; about the research here. Many of the serious researchers have spent
&gt; years, and countless hours a day testing these lines of communication.
&gt; I for one refuse to allow the negitive get to me and will continue to
&gt; work either independently or with my fellow colleages who truly  
&gt; respect
&gt; each other and their contributions in this area.
&gt;
&gt; So with that being said, I hope you enjoy the audio clips.
&gt; They are from a Joe&#x27;s Box session.
&gt;
&gt; In addition, I have introduced several new researchers to the
&gt; RS hacked in hopes that their their future studies will add in our up
&gt; hill climb in pursuing what we started.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Juli
