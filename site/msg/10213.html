What I am asking is if the files that I am putting up are the spirits talking and not just the radio scanning stations catching words here and there.
   
  I know Bruce once told someone that one of their files was just the radio and not spririts and that you have to delevop an ear for hearing them when they talk.

I can't explain it really, i just can tell the difference for the 
most part. You just have to go with the voice that sounds out of 
place most of the time. But than again, they can probably use radio 
words too. The jury is still out for me on this subject, i don't 
know how they do it i just know they do. Maybe Frank knows the 
answer, he built these things. I'm certainly no expert on this 
subject, i'm just a dopey box researcher.
