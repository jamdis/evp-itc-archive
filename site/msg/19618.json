That does help explain the differences between the various models. After the holidays, I&#39;ll have to start saving up. I am very technically challenged, so would look to buy the SpecterCam #2 with all the extras that are needed. If I had to buy all that stuff on my own, I&#39;d be buying the wrong cords or whatever. I seem to have a knack for that.\n\nThank you for the offer to sell at the Rolling Hills price!\n\n~Draiga\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I also use SpecterCam (SC)on Fact or Faked and off the show. The SC3 is certainly the most advanced model and I use that one on the series since at 600 lines, it&#39;s the highest resolution and we shoot in hi-def. It&#39;s priced at $340 but you have the added benefit of an adjustable image intensifier (think military night vision goggles) plus autoswitching power supply between 24VAC or 12VDC for long distance cord runs or battery power. It has many other features.\n&gt; \n&gt; The SC2 is a good compromise between price/performance with 500 lines at $230 plus it has unique features like motion detection and with 12VDC it can have resonable length power cords or battery power. It is slightly more compact than the SC1 or SC3.\n&gt; \n&gt; The SC1 is the way for people who want to experiement with full spec cams to get into this research and with 380 lines at $130 its very affordable. It runs on 24VAC so the cord runs can be long enough to go room to room if power isn&#39;t available where you want the camera set up.\n&gt; \n&gt; All have good sized and sensitive CCD&#39;s coupled with a good lens and have 75ohm video out BNC that you plug into a recorder or DVR. In darkened locations they are fine right out of the box but if the location is brightly lit, like it was in the Rolling Hills conference room, I attached a douple pass filter that allows UV and IR to pass but inhibits much of the visible spectrum. I did this to avoid overexposing the image. I offered the SC1 at $120 at the conference and am glad to extend that deal to anyone here in the group.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been offering the SC cams at all conferences I attend after purchasing them for use on the series. I really like them and compared them to other full spectrum solutions first. BTW, a more accurate term for virtually all cams that see into invisible spectrums is wide spectrum since the lens absorb some of the wavelength but the term full spectrum is what people have come to know. All of the SC models are capable of capturing very good video and light anomalies are showing up in the invisible spectrums which is encouraging this research.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are more features of each camera than what I listed here but wanted to list some of the highlights of each to help clarify the differences between models. \n&gt; \n&gt; A new one I now have is the SpecterCamCorder and as the name implies, it has on board media storage via SD cards (not included) plus an LCD touchscreen viewfinder. As is the case with all smaller cameras, there are limits and advantages to downsizing but the compromise is in the ability to gather light onto the imager. It goes for $284 and is a well done mobile camera that is the best of it&#39;s type in my opinion. \n&gt; \n&gt; -Bill \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;draiga1&quot; &lt;mail@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Sharon,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks so much for the info and pics from your experiments! It seems I had read somewhere that when a camera is a true full spectrum that the visible light may wash out anything seemn in the UV or IR range. Since most of my ghost hunts tend to be restricted to daytime, the Moditronics full (duo) spectrum seems like the better camera for me right now.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I do want a Spectercam 3 as well. I guess I&#39;ll have to start saving up for one. They each seem to be great cameras in their own respect.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ~Draiga\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, leongbabe@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Draiga, Ursula, CB, and Rick, and all others interested in this topic:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As promised, I&#39;ve attached a jpeg with the results of my camera experiment using 1) digital point n&#39; shoot camera, 2) Moditronics Deep IR camera, 3) Moditronics Full ( &quot;Duo&quot;) Spectrum camera, and 4) a Nikon camera converted into a Full Spectrum camera.  I took these shots, one after the other, and from the same angle, in a purportedly haunted alley in San Francisco&#39;s Chinatown.  Please note that I took these photos during the day, which was one of the reasons I purchased the two Moditronics cameras - their cameras don&#39;t see into the visible spectrum and thus prevent against visible light washing out any possible images that may be lurking in the IR and UV spectrums.  And, as you can see from the attached jpeg, in the fire escape one can see what looks like a head floating in the two photos I took with Moditronics Duo Spectrum and Deep IR cameras.  In the two photos taken with the regular point n&#39; shoot camera and the full spectrum camera, you can&#39;t see the floating head at all because the visible light washed it out.  Again, for night time investigations, the drawback with the Moditronics cameras is that you will need some kind of external light source in order to see anything (or, you can always turn on some lights - if lights are available, why sit in the dark?)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ursula, don&#39;t get me wrong, I think the SpecterCam 3 is a wonderful full spectrum camera (as a matter of fact, I&#39;ve just purchased one as a present to myself!).  I&#39;m going to experiment with it and will probably buy a filter for it that will block some of the visible light because, again, I don&#39;t want visible light possibly washing out the IR and UV spectrums, especially if I investigate during the day (I also investigate a lot of battlefields and many battlefields close early).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Apologies to the rest of you who may be asking, what does this have to do with EVPs?  Well, photos of true anomalies can help substantiate any EVPs captured and, I might add here, the Moditronics camcorders also record sound (unlike DVR cameras, such as Spectercams, where you would need to have a separate audio recorder if you want sound to go with the images).  And yes, I have also picked up EVPs on my camcorders. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, CB, I agree with you, the SVP cameras that Moditronics use for their conversions are pretty flimsy in construction (plastic casing).  I&#39;ve accidentally banged my Deep IR camera against the gear shift in the car and (Sob!) the bottom of the camera broke off from the tripod.  I duck-taped it back together and it still works, though (whew!).  (And yes, I, too, have noticed that the Ghost Hunters used the Moditronics full spectrum camera on one of their shows this year.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, Rick, don&#39;t sweat it.  For what you get for the price, I think you did fine.  But like CB said, don&#39;t drop these cameras or bang them around too much.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lastly, I think all kinds and grades of cameras are worth experimenting with.  I&#39;ve even captured a very interesting light anomaly with a cheap throwaway camera and have seen what appeared to be an apparition taken with a point n&#39; shoot.  So, whatever one can afford, go with it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Happy Holidays Everyone!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sharon from SF\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
