I&#39;ve spent a lot of long nights \nworking on something and not even realizing what time it was!\n\nThe good thing about my pcb making is that I can make as many or as few \nas I want. I&#39;ve tried making them in batches, where I make maybe 4 at a \ntime, and depending on the size of the board it can take the same amount \nof time as to make one.\n\nA friend of mine got his hands on some &quot;experimental&quot; NiMH AA-size \nbatteries that were supposed to be good for 3500 or 4000 mAh.  He said \nhe was told they were a bit unstable and could possibly explode when \nbeing used. I guess that&#39;s why they were experimental.  But once they get \nthe bugs worked out, these might be a good source of power.\n\nZack\n\nOn Wed, 9 Apr 2008, Frank Sumption wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.freepcb.com/\n&gt;\n&gt; This might work and the price is right. I actaully have two boards I want to make, the sweep board, and the AM tuner board. Then I might want to make a complete board, tuner and all. I was working on a board made to fit a RS project box, so the sides taper slightly. I had to make two seprate boards, the sweep is on a smaller daughter board-both using perf board.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hate it when that excitement starts setting in! It usually means days without sleep.\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW, I don&#39;t think I would want 30 of any given board, all at once anyway, but would want them available to others--they can order their own(?)\n&gt;\n&gt;  The next problem is power, using the AA-8 packs is kind of poor, sometimes they melt down, and the life isn&#39;t long enough. 1.2ah gel cells are good, but pricy. $50 just for batteries. The boxes require a + and - supply, or two 12 volt batteries.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S"}
