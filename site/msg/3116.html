 Oh I see! With the LM555 timer, you can a add transistor to make a consta=
nt current source on the threshold pin, and it puts out a linear ramp, but =
that only gives one way tuning on a radio, it'll sweep up the band, then re=
set to the beginning of the band, instead of going back down the band. I do=
n't think that's usable for my purposes. I use a square wave that goes thro=
ugh an integrator to convert it a triangle, so the voltage sweeps up smooth=
ly, then back down smoothly. It's possible to run op amps on a single suppl=
y with some biasing tricks. I might try that combined with the square wave =
output of a 555. The goal being to get rid of one of the battery packs. I u=
se gel cells, which have significant weight, and cost.
 
 Random mode is pr=
oblematic, unstable, and doesn't seem to work compared to the linear mode. =
Curious that it worked ok when that's all I had, now I can't get that mode =
to work with any of my new boxes. Random in the new box would not work at t=
he Stanely. Some have requested I leave it in, but it's just not worth the =
headache. 
 
 The system can be simplified, like leave out the mic amps, an=
d sound chamber, providing only a line output to go to a recorder, and spea=
ker driver. It's been my experience recently that spirits do not need the s=
ound chamber(aka echo box), and recording directly from a swept tuner works=
 just fine, and results in possibly clearer communications. There's less pl=
aces to introduce distortion and noise. Random results in broken up voices =
and phrases, and longer broadcast fragments. With good conditions, linear p=
rovides longer phrases, and more coherent messages. The "good conditions" b=
eing similar to radio propogation", in that sonmetimes it's good, and clear=

opogation effects, but I have nothing documented. 
 
 There is yet another =
method of raw audio, use a foreign language shortwave broadcast that you do=

the  broadcast.  On playback there should be coherent, and meaningful messa=
ges in your language.  Curiously, people that speak whatever language you u=
se don't hear the messages. You could even use stuff off the web, like Chin=

up hunting last year, and the other guys could hear the messages I was gett=
