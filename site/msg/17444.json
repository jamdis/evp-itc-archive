Those stopping this conversation are the ones\n&gt; who will not listen to another viewpoint.

It&#39;s not a discussion of whether or not\n&gt; science can tackle the afterlife, it&#39;s an arguement about what is acceptable\n&gt; to think about.\n&gt;\n&gt;  There is more than enough &quot;evidence&quot; to show this stuff is not\n&gt; imagination.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I get voices via &quot;the broken radio&quot; that use words not allowed on\n&gt; broadcast radio to show it is not radio broadcast fragments, or imagination.\n&gt; Yet, not enough for these so called skeptics, or the issue is sidestepped/\n&gt; ignored. I submit there is proof, proof that something talks that is not\n&gt; supposed to be there.\n&gt;\n&gt;  If a stranger tells you his name, do you automatically assume he must be\n&gt; lying? If a spirit tells you who he is, must you assume it&#39;s a lie, or\n&gt; worse? Why, because, somehow we know better? If a voice claims to be an ET,\n&gt; it has to be lying. Why? Because we all that is not possible.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, Jun 2, 2010 at 10:33 AM, John S &lt;phenom_investigator @yahoo.com&lt;http://mc/compose?to=phenom_investigator@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  I would like to try to address some of the themes that have been going\n&gt;&gt; back and\n&gt;&gt; forth in this forum of late; specifically, the state of science and the\n&gt;&gt; real explanatory\n&gt;&gt; power,  or lack thereof, it truly has.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Two highly respected parapsychologists recently published an interesting\n&gt;&gt; book\n&gt;&gt; called &quot;Handbook to the Afterlife&quot;. They are Dr. Pamela Rae Heath and Dr.\n&gt;&gt; Jon\n&gt;&gt; Klimo. (Frank don&#39;t even THINK of hitting the Reply button quite yet.) In\n&gt;&gt; this book,\n&gt;&gt; they have distilled hundreds of channeled messages from many centuries in\n&gt;&gt; an\n&gt;&gt; attempt to present a comprehensive mixture of what these message might\n&gt;&gt; tell\n&gt;&gt; us about the nature of death and the afterlife. Heath and Klimo clearly\n&gt;&gt; state that\n&gt;&gt; this book is not for everyone. It is for those who find the topic\n&gt;&gt; interesting and\n&gt;&gt; wonder what has been learned from such  communications. Clearly those who\n&gt;&gt; doubt such communications are possible or who disbelieve in the concept of\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; afterlife probably will have no use for this book.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Here are two well-known scientists (in the Parapsychology community) who\n&gt;&gt; acknoweldge that sometimes it is more important to suggest what might be\n&gt;&gt; possible than to stand only on that which is empirically proveable. The\n&gt;&gt; very\n&gt;&gt; nature of science is to explain where possible and to recognize that quite\n&gt;&gt; often the right answer to many questions is &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dr. Julie Beischel and Dr. Gary Schwartz have conducted extensive research\n&gt;&gt; into mediumship. What that research has demonstrated is that there are\n&gt;&gt; people who can know things they should not with no known ways of this\n&gt;&gt; happening. This is called &#39;anomalous information reception&#39; in\n&gt;&gt; Parapsychology.\n&gt;&gt; The point is that we know this anomalous ability exists. What we do not\n&gt;&gt; know, from the Science, is whether discarnate entities are communicating.\n&gt;&gt; Certainly the research mediums involved believe so, such is the nature of\n&gt;&gt; their compelling experiences. But the Science cannot, to date, support\n&gt;&gt; the claim. And that is what is critical to understand here.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At the same time, it is important to recognize that using technology does\n&gt;&gt; not necessarily imply the Scientific Method nor does is mean one is doing\n&gt;&gt; Science. What it does mean is that a part of the experience is documented\n&gt;&gt; and that might be useful at some future time when Science does have the\n&gt;&gt; tools and understanding to further evaluate the documents. Today this is,\n&gt;&gt; unfortunately, simply not true.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What is known is that people are recording audio and video and believe\n&gt;&gt; they have captured anomalies. Many people think these represent voices\n&gt;&gt; of spirits and loved ones. Unfortuantely the pure truth is that Science is\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; simply not in a position to validate this at this time. But that does not\n&gt;&gt; mean anyone should stop, nor that anyone should feel they have no reason\n&gt;&gt; to guess what might be going on, or to speculate about the phenomena.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It also means that cynics and skeptics who demand proof are going to\n&gt;&gt; have a hard time finding it. If Science is not yet able to describe what\n&gt;&gt; it\n&gt;&gt; is that is going on, skeptics and cynics have no way to determine what\n&gt;&gt; is absolute proof. They can however choose to accept some personal\n&gt;&gt; variant of their own truth as acceptable proof should they so desire.\n&gt;&gt; But this is not empirical proof as required by Science.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dr. Donald Hoffman is an expert on visual perception and is one of\n&gt;&gt; the authors of &quot;Conscious Realism&quot; - a scientific theory of reality\n&gt;&gt; which is the first to solve the mind/body problem. Dr. Hoffman is one\n&gt;&gt; scientist who completely understands how people misperceive things,\n&gt;&gt; and yet his controversial theories challenge even some of the world&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; leading theoretical physicists when it comes to understanding. Clearly\n&gt;&gt; there are scientists who appreciate this phenomena may well be real.\n&gt;&gt; I have personal dialogs with them frequently. You would simply not\n&gt;&gt; believe how frustrating it is for someone whose job it is to explain\n&gt;&gt; the world to others to have no idea whatsoever what might be going\n&gt;&gt; on here.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I hope this helps put a face on Science, and that I have succintly\n&gt;&gt; but  clearly explained why Science offers no magic explanations\n&gt;&gt; at this time. And at the same time, perhaps this will better set\n&gt;&gt; expectations for everyone while recognizing that the work being\n&gt;&gt; done here may well have potential merit in the due course of time.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\nI'm only s oppping con e sa ion  when i 's no hing bu name calling and pe sonal a acks. \n \n F-S\nOn Wed, Jun 2, 2010 a 11:45 AM, Rj as e e @...> w o e:\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI ag ee ha science is capable o designing con olled es s o EVP/ITC claims.
