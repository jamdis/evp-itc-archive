done Sunday.

&gt;Hi Frank,
&gt;
&gt;   The interview did go well. Sorry for any anxiety it may have caused but 
&gt;hopefully you are now comfortable with me. I am committed to honoring your 
&gt;intended purpose and today shared time with Mark Macy using your box and he 
&gt;is equally impressed. Mark only adheres to the research of contact with 
&gt;postive ethereal beings. You are considered by many to be an important 
&gt;pioneer in the field of ITC research.
&gt;
&gt;   Thank you for your time and trust. You have managed to break new ground 
&gt;and have joined the ranks of those that have made a real impact in 
&gt;facilitating communication with non physical intelligence.
&gt;
&gt;   Sincerely, Bill -----
