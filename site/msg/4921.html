Ann,
 
Thanks for listening that batch of files came from a recent session =
when the signal was not at it's optimum.
Some times you will receive a less=
 than adequate session due to the conditions at the time the session is in =
progress
I and a couple of other researchers  are now in the process of doc=
umenting the exact conditions present during
a box session and the differen=
t affects some conditions have on the clarity and strength of the communica=
tion.
 
As far as the Elvis message goes, we have to remember that spirits =
where also people at one time and that when 
we go to the first spiritual l=
evel after we leave the physical we carry with us many of the characteristi=
cs we had in our earthly personality.
some spirits are shy some out going s=
ome serious some are comedians.
 
I believe the Elvis impersonation was not=
 meant maliciously but as a joke. Also the way I determine the validity of =
the communications I receive is
I have gotten to know my techs and have bui=
lt a relationship with them, I recognise the way they speak and they will e=
ven go out of their way
to manipulate certain sound fragments so that the v=
oice they create is familiar and recognisable to me. I can pretty much rely=
 on what I get from them.
But you can never be 100% sure, you can only use =
your best judgement and gut instinct and fly a little on faith.

Bruce--I listened to them all, every single one that got posted yesterd=
ay.

I didn't comment because I didn't find this batch to be as strong as y=
ours usually are. Although I meant to post and say that I was quite sad tha=
t the Elvis we heard might be an impersonator. Would you ask them why they =
allow a fake to come through--since that EVP was quite long and elaborately=
 "staged," for lack of a better term. Surely Mike could stop a fake? I'm ve=
ry curious about what's happening over there as we are operating the box, a=
nd it is very important to me to feel a good amount of certainty that the p=
eople coming through are who they claim to be. If you can ask, I'd be grate=
ful. I don't seem to be able to get those kind of responses yet on my own.
