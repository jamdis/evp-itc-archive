Oh, you went beyond that =
assumption.

You said I thought there had to be foul play involved.=C2=A0 Y=
ou said I assumed right

But what I said was: 

"As =

paranormal yet.=C2=A0 However, people continue to say there is more to i=
t than my

You misquoted me to all the people r=
eading this list. Why did you do that?
