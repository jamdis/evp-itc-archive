It would depend on which link/file you referenced.=C2=A0 I really posted to=

But, in the results email, the first link was the one that required a pass=

The=C2=A0 first link allowed you to download a secure pdf with the picture =
before the test.

It was secure on your computer, if you read the instructi=

After the test, I sim=

That is not mentalism: its encryption.=C2=A0 And pretty secure at that.

Did you read the email where I said: 



"So what =

  experimen=

 do. Just that, for whatever reason, they did not work this time. Reade=

So you see I have not, as you noted,=
 said anything like "I told you so".

Why do you continue to quote things I=
 did not say?=C2=A0 Is Frank coaching you via email? ;-)

and trying things themselves, they feel they are superior to the researcher=

t want to treat them like some retarded idiots over there, i wish to give t=

t because they didn't get your test right doesn't mean that it's any less f=
