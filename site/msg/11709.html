Thanks Bryan for replying
I was absolutely amazed when I saw that. 
Does th=
e puck and the ovilus work together? 
This is very interesting. How do you =
think it works as far as
assigning a word according to the results from the=
 sensors?
Could it leave words out? Example: What if something said
Demon (=
 that was in Paranormal State) and it was trying to
say Not Demon?

Hi=
 Debbie,
   I think the Ovilus is similar to the Paranormal Puck.  What it =
does
is take constant evironmental readings off the sensors inside it, does=

some math on them, then based off the result, assigns it to a word from
a =
list of words it knows.  That word is then output through a speakjet
microc=
hip that you hear.
   I could be wrong though, but from my techie point of =
view...it's
pretty darn cool. :)
All the best,
Bryan

I don't know how many of the members watch Paranormal State, =
but they
used
a new piece of equipment called The Ovilus. You guys have got=
 to check
this
out. Go to www.digitaldowsing. com <http://www.digitaldowsin=

am not really sure who these guys are, and
where they came up wi=
th this. To me, it sounds kind of like Frank's Box,
but
not the same.
Frank=
, please take a look at this, and tell us what  you think.
I don't understa=
