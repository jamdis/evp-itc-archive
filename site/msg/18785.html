<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Many &quot;digital&quot; radios are just analog radios that are tuned with a voltage
that the processor puts out, the radio itself is analog. I disconnect the
processor board, after determining the function of the signals going to the
radio board. You have to be able to turn on the radio itself with no
processor board, then find the band change connection, the tuning voltage
connection.

  In the first boxes I used tuner modules removed from car stereos, then
after the hack was &quot;discovered&quot; I started using other radios, such as the
Radio Shack models, but I would only use the radio board, and disgard the
rest. I have used walkman style radios as well, again, disgarding the
processor board.  Usually there is a ribbon cable to the radio, you just
have to determine what voltages are needed to operate the radio, and supply
these from a power supply or voltage regulator.

 I use Arm Band radios, Headphone radios, alarm clock radios that have
digital tuning. I try to find radios that have a seperate tuner board.

 So far radios that use a square chip seem to be software controled, so I
avoid those. Not all digital radios are usable. The car tuners tend to be
noisy.

 Sometimes you can find the tuning voltage in a radio and just cut he
connection, then insert an external tuning voltage from a sweep circuit. I
have a Aiwa home stereo system that I made into a box using this method.
It&#x27;s not portable, but it works well, it has the advantage of a built in
tape recorder.

&gt; One question Frank , its posible make a frank box whith an analogic radio ?
&gt; ... its a problem make it here in Peru . The digital radios are all whith
&gt; the &quot;Mute&quot; , and the &quot;beep&quot; , its a problem , i cant still make , Are there
&gt; any simple radio can i build ? ... whith a simply chip , in u.s.a are the
&gt; radio shack´s radios , its are simply to hack , but here in peru , there are
&gt; only radios like &quot;walkman&quot; style , or discmans ,
&gt;
