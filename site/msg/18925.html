<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks. I don&#x27;t do investigations, and usually asking questions does not
work for me, so I am not 100% on how much the entities rely on broadcast
stations, or if it&#x27;s possible to still get voices with no radio stations.
Lots of questions that need answers.

&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt;
&gt; I haven&#x27;t been on the lists much lately due to a heavy Fall workload, but I
&gt; wanted to let you know that I have been using your box, and getting great
&gt; results. I did a session with a girl who had a loved one commit suicide, and
&gt; he came through.
&gt;
&gt; I have some investigations coming up where I will be bringing my Steve&#x27;s
&gt; box too!
&gt;
&gt; I also asked the box about a sensitive situation with a ghost and a family,
&gt; and got answers to my questions on that as well.
&gt;
&gt; I know you work very hard on your boxes and they rock! The day before
&gt; yesterday I was more signally challenged than usual and had the sweep set
&gt; quite fast, yet clear as can be a woman&#x27;s voice came through a couple of
&gt; times. It could not have been stray radio signal.
&gt;
&gt; So just wanted to let you know, that I may fall way behind on the lists at
&gt; the moment till I get this updating done, I am still using your box, though.
&gt; Your hard work is appreciated here!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Draiga

&gt; &gt; Was that the same person who stole box #63 after i tested it and sent it
&gt; back to you. I hate to see these things go to waste. It really gets to me
&gt; when you send these boxes to people after spending several hours making
&gt; them, only to sit on someones shelf getting dusty.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There are a lot of people who want these, so how can you tell who is a
&gt; good candidate to get one?

&gt; &gt; &gt; One of the skepdorks wanted to put one of my boxes ina faraday cage for
&gt; &gt; &gt; testing. My response was Well Dah, of course it won&#x27;t work if you block
&gt; out
&gt; &gt; &gt; the radio signals. I told him to bite me.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as EVP, I thought someone tried that and you can get &quot;normal&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just had a thought go thru my head ( Oh shit ).What would happen if
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; put a voice recorder in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Faraday Cage, and have a session with a ghost box.... The Faraday
&gt; Cage
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isn&#x27;t supposed to pick up radio
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interference right ? Would it pick up the other voices or not ? I
&gt; know the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; entities are talking thru the radio
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but has anyone ever tried it ? Stupid question huh ?????
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
