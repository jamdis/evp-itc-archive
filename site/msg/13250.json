No matter which method is used. Everyone hears differently, different speaker setups, different software. I just post a variety of whats clear to me using different methods. Sometimes the one thats not one I think of as clear is the one everyone agrees on as being clear. Go figure.\n\nMisty\n\n\n--- On Tue, 1/13/09, Rj &lt;rasterer@yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: Rj &lt;rasterer@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] New Water EVP\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, January 13, 2009, 3:56 PM\n&gt; If you&#39;d like some feedback, I could definitely make out\n&gt; what sounded like water, and perhaps slowed down water.Â \n&gt; But other than that, it seemed a strain to me to attribute\n&gt; any of those noises to anything vocal or intelligent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just my opinion,\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 1/13/09, Misty Dawn\n&gt; &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@yahoo.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] New Water EVP\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, January 13, 2009, 10:31 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;             Heres a few voices from my latest session\n&gt; recording water then slowing down -74% in audacity. For me\n&gt; they are quite loud and the clarity was great. I recorded\n&gt; these on a night of the full moon (which does seem to help).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Attaching a few of the clearer ones to this post and for\n&gt; those who dont get the dailies you can listen on my esnips\n&gt; site.
