Many of the\n&gt; modern digital radios have a function that mutes, or quiets the radio while\n&gt; tuning between stations. I&#39;m not sure why, but unmutting the radio allows\n&gt; the audio to be heard while the radio searches for the next\n&gt; station--and--the radio is disallowed form locking onto a station, so it\n&gt; keeps sweeping all the way to the end of the band--AM or FM, then starts\n&gt; over. This creates the raw audio and &quot;they&quot; speak. The sweep can even be\n&gt; done by hand, tuning a radio slowing by hand. I sue cheap radios I get at\n&gt; thrift stores for this, gluing a dowel to the tuning knob to make it easier.\n&gt; Then record form the speaker--open air.\n&gt;\n&gt;  So as long as the radio sweeps at not to fast and not too slow, it&#39;ll\n&gt; works. Some are better than others.\n&gt;\n&gt;  It takes some practice, and maybe even a certain allowing to hear the\n&gt; ghost voices.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I prefer to take a tuner out of a radio, such as a clock radio and supply\n&gt; an external sweep voltage. The sweep circuits are just basic op amps, and\n&gt; you can buy a function generator kit to supply a triangle wave for linear\n&gt; sweep. See keyportparanormal.com for more info on using this kit, and\n&gt; building boxes.\n&gt;\n&gt;  One problem with this stuff is that it can be extremely subjective, others\n&gt; may not hear what you hear, or hear it the same. I think mostly the messages\n&gt; are meant for the one that receives it. We go round and round with the\n&gt; skeptics and debunkers.\n&gt;\n&gt;  F-S\n&gt; On Sun, Aug 29, 2010 at 11:08 PM, usmcmacswife &lt;usmcmacswife@...&lt;http://mc/compose?to=usmcmacswife@yahoo.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok, we&#39;re new here hello!\n&gt;\n&gt; We just had a couple questions.
