Turns out most of the &quot;voices&quot; are noise/gibberish. Besides, even prefectly audible EVP--who cares! Everyone wants their own &quot;evidence&quot; and their egos pumped up. Now, I don&#39;t catalog anything, barely record the dates, don&#39;t label the tapes. I try to be repectfull since &quot;they&quot; went to the trouble of giving messages, but I&#39;m not gonna save ten thousand tapes that will just turn to dust, or end up in the dump. \n\n EVP is like someone else&#39;s psychic reading, who cares except the one person it was meant for? \n No one is going to go back and listen to endless hours of static and noise for messages that have no personal meaning. All you have to demonstrate is there is something to this, and how to do it. I didn&#39;t waste any time listening to Raudive&#39;s or Jurgensens recordings. \n\nF-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Everyone please be careful with file storage, I had lost most all of mine  \n&gt; because my back up drive failed, I can&#39;t get them back, i lost the MFR, and \n&gt; I  don&#39;t know what to do now, lost all, my family and horse pictures, music  \n&gt; collection, all the spirit files, all my saved Theme collection, a program \n&gt; I can  never get back, so, please everyone, make at least two different back \n&gt; up  drives. sf\n&gt;"}
