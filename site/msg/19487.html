<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Our group bought 2 of the model 1&#x27;s.  These were the only model that were
available when we bought them from Bill Murphy on Halloween weekend of this
year.

As of yet, we have caught nothing, but have only used them on 3
investigations so far. But as you know, video is the hardest evidence to
capture!

&gt; &gt; My group uses 2 of them and each one is
&gt; &gt; attached to a portable DVD recorder that has a small LCD screen, you can
&gt; &gt; find these refurbished for under $100.
