Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: An incident that may be a concern

                Hey, I'd look at this (if true) as something positive and not 
something to fear.  A white cloud to me sounds like "light" and just 
may be a good spirit/entity or whoever, in the home. How do we know 
that this was a negative spirit/ghost trying to bring others through 
an electronic device and into a home for mischief???  ;)

I personally do not subscribe to the whole portal thing.  If so, then 
my house would be filled with ghosts after all my watching of 
innumerable paranormal TV shows!  I think my TV would make a much 
better portal than my radios...  :)
