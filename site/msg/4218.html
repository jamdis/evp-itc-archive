<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rita

I only choose the clear plastic so I could see the three component 
devices inside. (The pretty blue tint of the radio LCD while 
sweeping, the flashing red light as the noise generator is playing, 
and the blue hue of the amp microphone while it is on).  The chamber 
is closed enough to allow the sound waves to bounce around and mix.  
Any of the materials you mentioned would work, with some very very 
slight differences in sound, I&#x27;m sure, based on the properties of 
absortion, reflection, refraction, etc.  And I think the chamber is 
small enough, with the devices close in proximity enough not impact 
the sound regardless of which material is used.

As for controlling from outside, only with my prototype is there a 
need to open the box/chamber after each session. I redesigned after 
that. The three production units (Prod 1, Prod 2, Prod 3)I built each 
have three access holes, which are rubber grommeted. These allow you 
to leave the chamber closed, and still allow you to start and stop 
the noise generator, up or down sweep the radio, and turn the radio 
on or off. You only open the chamber once, to remove the cable and 
turn on the microphone, then you can keep it closed and control the 
other devices with a small push pole the remainder of the time.  You 
only need to open the chamber again when you are done with all your 
sessions.

&gt; Thank you for all of the responses.
&gt; 
&gt; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m curious as to why the plastic enclosure.  I know on your video 
&gt; you mentioned both a shoebox or cigar box could be used as well.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m going to try this chamber experiment, but my question is what 
&gt; enclosure would be best so as not to inhibit the sounds, by the 
&gt; material of the enclosure actually absorbing any of the sound.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m no scientist by any means, so maybe my concern is mute, but it 
&gt; would seem to me that perhaps a glass (or lead crystal) or metal 
(tin 
&gt; box) enclosure would be an interesting experiment as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, have you given any thought to a single toggle/power up switch 
&gt; that would power all devices on at once, perhaps from outside of 
the 
&gt; box, thereby eliminating the need to open and close the box with 
each 
&gt; session.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you think?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks!

&gt; &gt; Hi Rita,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Welcome to the group.  Yes, Bruce is correct... my sound chamber 
&gt; design is an experiment to see how well that design works.  I took 
&gt; the basic components of a typical ghost box system and placed them 
&gt; into the plastic enclosure. But to hear what is desired does not 
&gt; always require a chamber. The chamber is just a place where the 
three 
&gt; sound components can mix and be captured by the microphone.
&gt; &gt; Just one of many different methods that can be used.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have even got good results by just using a 12-470 and a 
recorder 
&gt; in the open air.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I did build a couple of new chamber systems and will probably 
build 
&gt; one more for a total of 4.  And I&#x27;ll probably provide some of those 
&gt; to some locals here to test. I&#x27;d like to get others input on this 
&gt; experimental design. LC is also putting one together using the 12-
&gt; 469. So we will have data from that area too.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Again... welcome to the group.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Rita,
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; And welcome to the group I am always pleased to see new members 
&gt; and new interest in our research.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; You do not need anything extra to use the 12-469 you can use it 
&gt; with just the ear buds that are supplied with the radio.
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you like you can purchase an inexspensive fold up speaker 
from 
&gt; radio shack. It is 19.99 and works quite well.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; go to this page for a pic and description of the speaker

&gt; &gt; &gt; The sound chamber that mike colleta has been developing is an 
&gt; experiment he is doing and is in no way necessary to
&gt; &gt; &gt; obtain good spirit communication with the RS box.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Rita, I think you will have to get a pair of amplified speakers 
&gt; on that 469, and put them in a sound chamber of some sort. In that 
&gt; chamber, you will want probably an amplified microphone running 
into 
&gt; your voice recorder, to pick up the sounds bouncing around in 
there. 
&gt; You can also add some white noise into the box, but I think people 
&gt; are getting results without adding the additional noise. The 
chamber 
&gt; seems to really bounce the sound around and give you a good mix to 
&gt; record.LC--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rita&quot; &lt;nvrenuf1031@&gt;

voices 
&gt; from the radio stations or &gt; just white noise?&gt; &gt; Also, is it best 
to 
&gt; hook up an external speaker, one or two, in order &gt; to record to a 
&gt; digital recorder? What is the best way to record, using &gt; digital 
&gt; recorder, or direct into PC using Sound recorder, and using a &gt; 
line 
&gt; in/line out connection?&gt; &gt; What is the recommended length of 
&gt; sessions. Should I try just a minute &gt; or two, or longer at one 
&gt; sitting?&gt; &gt; Thanks to all!&gt; Rita&gt;
