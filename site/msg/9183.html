<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Elizabeth,

AHA!  You appear here, too!
:-)

No, I haven&#x27;t done that yet.  I dug thru my junquebox of electronic parts 
to gather together what I needed to make one, but didn&#x27;t have a few parts 
and never got around to ordering them. Maybe one of these days, I hope ...

&gt; I&#x27;m sure there are lots of Radio Shacks out in the boonies that have a few
&gt; in stock that aren&#x27;t going to get people coming in to buy them to hack. I
&gt; can think of a dozen fairly small towns around here that have Radio Shacks
&gt; and probably no people around with paranormal interests.
