They have a design for a type of lazer listening device that sounds a lot l=
ike your record player. You can bounce the lazer off a window of a house an=
d hear whatever conversation or noise that causes the window to vibrate. Th=
e electric eye you speak of is probably a phototransistor that converts lig=
ht into an electric signal, which can be converted to sound with an 8 ohm s=
peaker.

One of the techniques I play=

dulated lazer transmitter and photoelectric receiver. I could either transm=
it ambient room noise (hoping for evp), or any signal I can run through=A0a=
 9mm connection. The clarity was phenomenal but the timing was out of step.=
 I would get loooonnnnggg speech with long tones. I think the frequency of =
the lazer light was too high, which kept it out of sync with whatever level=
 I was talking to at the time. I vowed to use a green or blue lazer (shorte=
