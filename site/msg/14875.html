I'd agree to that. He shares his research, never charges for a=

I grow more and more concerned about t=

Hi All

I h=
ave to admit that I share the same opinion as Bruce. I dont what everyones =
take is on this but I felt that some of moon and even Franks attitude was s=
lightly arrogant. I am a researcher in the UK using old reel to reel method=
s and obtaining excellent results. I lost some family and some close friend=
s=A05 yeara ago=A0and suddenly it dawned on me...what is life all about. I =
went on to research every evp pioneer i could, listen to hours/days of reco=
rdings and it changed my outlook on life. tears were turned to smiles and t=
hen I realised what all this research is for. it was a big step for me spir=
itually. 

I dont know if there is anyone else on here using old fashioned =
methods but if anybody would like to hear recordings please ask. I am using=
 a reel to reel sony "Hi frequency" recorder and trying various types of to=
nes, backgrounds e.t.c.

Good luck to everyone with their research, you are=
 right we are changing history we are discovering new things. if it wasnt f=
or individuals such as raudive, jurghenson to name a few, maybe we wouldnt =
have discovered this. it takes a brave individual to tackle an arrogant hum=
an race blunted with science.

Kind Regards

The quiet one :-)

guys,

Sorry to burden you with this nonsense but this group and the RTSC =
group are my only venues to respond to posts on other groups and have my ac=
count heard, I hope you do not mind to much.

Here is a copy of my final pe=
rsonal e-mail to Frank Sumption which by the way is meant for him but he se=
e's fit to post them publicly in an attempt to discredit me.

I want you to=
 read it first hand so there are no chance of it being altered before it is=
 posted else where.

I will not address Frank again
------------ --------- =
--------- --------- --------- --------- -

Frank,

This is getting ridiculo=
us now, you should stop writing these posts, all you are doing is making yo=
urself look ridiculous.

I have offered many times to make my raw recording=
s available for review by anyone who wants them. I have made the same chall=
enge to your friend moon who we all know is behind this tirade he has time =
and again refused or ignored the request for any type of audio file
to be p=
ublicly posted for revue and continues to take advantage of innocent unsusp=
ecting people with his con game and charging large amounts of money for ses=
sions where he fabricates and makes up content as he goes along.

I was the=
 only one to confront him in public and expose him for the fake he is and t=
his is his feeble attempt at retaliation. I and other researchers like me h=
ave brought this research light years from where it was when you and I firs=
t met, moon just continues to use it to rip people off and has not contribu=
ted a thing to the research of ghost box communication beside lining his ow=
n pockets. 

Just the fact that he has you doing his dirty work shows the t=
ype of guy he is. I can remember a time when you publicly came out against =
any type of money making using your boxes and even refused moon when he wan=
ted to manufacture and sell them for large profits yet now you condone his =
robbery of innocent unaware people and actually act foolish on his behest.
=

Frank you are better than this, just concentrate on developing a better bo=
x and forget about moon and his tricks and lies, he is finished in the para=
normal and he knows it, everyone is wise to his game and he is practically =
an outcast.

Frank you are hitching you wagon to a dead horse. Get away fro=
m these bad influences before they ruin your reputation as well.

We have h=
ad this moon discussion in the past and once he has exhausted his need for =
you he will screw you again like he has done so many times before.

Frank, =
I like and respect you and I hope you will consider what I have said in thi=
s e-mail and I sincerely hope you post this one on the evp-itc group. I wil=
l be posting it on my group and others I belong to.

Your former friend
