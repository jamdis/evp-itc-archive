Any thoughts on th=\r\nis meter?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Country\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;The PX EMF meter is a talking ghost =\r\nbox which translate EMF signals into speech. It uses an internal database o=\r\nf 2000+ words or can translate in Phonetic Mode speech which is not in the =\r\ndictionary. It also has a reverse Phonetic mode. My favorite though is the =\r\nTouch Mode. In this mode, if the PX is left alone and someone or something =\r\ntouches it, it will start pinging like a deep sea submarine.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1: Diction=\r\nary Mode the PX has 2048 internal words that are used in this mode\n&gt; 2: Pho=\r\nnetic Mode the PX will use phonemes to speak\n&gt; 3. Reverse Phonetic Mode The=\r\n PX will reverse the phonetic output in effect it talks backwards\n&gt; 4. Touc=\r\nh Mode this mode is used to detect if the device is being touched\n&gt; 5. Voic=\r\ne Change Mode, this mode is the same as #1 dictionary mode except the voice=\r\n\n&gt; can be altered detected inputs\n&gt; 6. Repeat Mode say last words said .. i=\r\nn this mode the PX will repeat the last words spoke from last said to first=\r\n\n&gt; up to 400 words.\n&gt; 7. Energy Mode : this mode allows the user to set the=\r\n sensitivity of the device with one of 3\n&gt; preset levels. The PX will say L=\r\nOW then give four beeps pressing mode during this time will set the Energy =\r\nlevel low.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\r\n--_000_AB3E6B5188566C488E011B9C54CF2A18060575F358satlrccdlmb60_\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.=\r\nw3c.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-eq=\r\nuiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Dus-ascii&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=\r\n=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.5969&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY style=3D&quot;BACKGROU=\r\nND-COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D096224917-180820=\r\n10&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;Thx&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D096224917-18082010&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAria=\r\nl \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;I was wondering if Bill Chappell made \nthat....=\r\n..&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D096224917-=\r\n18082010&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;I can&#39;t say for certa=\r\nin that I trust that the Ovilus really \nworks.......&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D096224917-18082010&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAri=\r\nal \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;Most of the time it just keeps saying the same=\r\n thing over \nand over again.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dlef=\r\nt&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D096224917-18082010&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=\r\n=3D2&gt;I will have to go check that PX EVP out on his \nwebsite.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D096224917-18082010&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DArial \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;All of these devices are really inter=\r\nesting though, aren&#39;t \nthey???&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dl=\r\neft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D096224917-18082010&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \ncolor=3D#0000ff si=\r\nze=3D2&gt;My favorite so far is MY Steve&#39;s \nBox........&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D096224917-18082010&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAri=\r\nal \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;That thing is amazing.....
