There is much debate and discussion as to whether or not the information 
a=
pparently received in EVP sessions comes from within or from external
sourc=
es. The 2012 issue offers a unique opportunity to resolve this question.

S=
ome Mayan experts say that the notion that they Mayan calendar ends
in 2012=
 is in fact a misinterpretation of the facts; that the current Mayan
calend=
ar indeed ends in that year, but Mayan calendars continue on well
into the =
next millenium at least. If this is true the Mayans may have never
believed=
 everything would come to an end in the year we know as 2012.

The only rea=
l test is to wait until the end of 2012 and see what happens.
Let&#x27;s be opti=
mistic and presume that nothing or little untoward indeed
occurs. What=C2=
=A0would this say about these, and similar communications?

One reasonable =
suggestion is that this would support the idea that the 
communications are=
 not from an external source, but are instead coming
from ourselves or at l=
east from other living beings. If the predictions turn 
out to be wrong, th=
is seems like convincing evidence that the source was
in fact misinformed. =
And while it is possible that discarnate entities are
playing tricks on us,=
 an equally reasonable interpretation is that we are
in fact the source at =
least of these communications, perhaps through 
some form of PK. 

As I hav=
e reported here before, there is good test data that suggests 
this is quit=
e possible in living persons. So this would be one more data 
point support=
ing the thesis that EVPs may in fact be the product of the 
living and not =
the dead.

It will be an interesting couple of years, no matter what - that=
 is certain.

Yes. As a matter of fact, paredolia is=

phenomena. Pareidolia is a function of t=

I think part of the animosity between the scientis=
t/skeptic and the paranormalist/believer, is that they are speaking a diffe=
rent language, and often don=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t know it.



Both come=
 up with theories. =C3=82=C2=A0And these may lead to conclusions. =C3=82=C2=
=A0A scientist frames this as part of the scientific method, and expects a =
lot of work to be done between the theory and the conclusions. =C3=82=C2=A0=
A believer often starts with a theory, =C3=82=C2=A0and then states new thin=
gs based on that. =C3=82=C2=A0The scientist interprets the believer=C3=A2=
=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s statements as the believers =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=9Cconclu=
sions=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2, and is appalled at the lack of process that =
got the believer from theory to conclusion. =C3=82=C2=A0



The believer is=
 appalled at the scientist&#x27;s closed mind. =C3=82=C2=A0But in fact, the beli=
ever did not mean their statements to actually be conclusions, in the scien=
tific sense. =C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0The believer thinks about their theori=
es, maybe tests them, and more often than not, comes up with new THEORIES. =
=C3=82=C2=A0But by not stating that these are theories, the scientist sees =
them as conclusions (since they seemed to flow from theory and testing). =
=C3=82=C2=A0And hence, the friction between these camps.



So I think both=
 parties share some of the blame. =C3=82=C2=A0The scientist assumes the bel=
iever understands the scientific method, and is making conclusions from the=
 scientific method, when the believer may really just be detailing more the=
ories. =C3=82=C2=A0The believer watches scientific-looking tv shows, uses s=
cientific-looking equipment, and uses scientific-sounding words like =C3=A2=
=E2=82=AC=CB=9Ctheory=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2 and =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=9Cevid=
ence=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2, without realizing this casts them into the sc=
ientific method in the ears of the scientific community.



What to do? =C3=
=82=C2=A0I think if the scientist/skeptic more often asked things like =C3=
=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93Are you sure of that, or is that a theory?=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=
=EF=BF=BD, and the paranormalist/believer used the word =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=
=9Ctheory=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2 a lot more in their proclamations, it wou=
ld go a long way toward less hostilities.

I think I can help on the Queen Mary stuff. The late Peter James actually=

became well-known because he facilitated the production of the audible
voi=
ce of the little girl known to him (and the rest of the world) as &quot;Jackie.&quot;=

This recording, not an EVP, became for many clear evidence that the 
littl=
e girl was quite real. Many people, including some known personally
to me, =
claim to have seen this little girl and others in the First Class Pool
area=
. This story goes back many years before Disney had anything to do
with the=
 Queen Mary, so I think it is correct to say that myth is wrong.

=C3=82=C2=A0 Yeah, that was fr=
om me(Frank). Yeah that helps, at least you&#x27;re not just
some brainiac debun=
ker that knows it all cuz he says so.

Anyway, I find it very difficult to =
get absolutes with this work, as the
mind has a hell of lot to do with it. =
An example, I started out using a
randiom voltage to sweep the radios becua=
se I was using EVPmaker previous to
making boxes, and EVPmaker uses a metho=
d of chopping up the raw audio, and
playing it back for use by the enities.=
 When I first swtiched to a linear
sweep all I couyld hear was gibberish, t=
hen very suddenly I hear hear &quot;them&quot;
talking on my fisrt linear sweep box. =
So did it take &quot;them&quot; time to adapt,
or did it take my brain to make sense =
out of the gibberish.

For me, I don&#x27;t care which it is, I think it&#x27;s valid=
 either way. If it is
only the mind creating the messages you hear, which I=
 doubt because others
can hear alot of this stuff, then I think it&#x27;s still =
being used as a psychic
prop and the information is valid.

Then there&#x27;s th=
e probelm of expectations, if you test this stuff in a lab,
I think you&#x27;ll =
limit your results, and get whatever is expected. If you&#x27;r
expecting eviden=
ce of a haunting, that&#x27;s what you get. I was on the Queen
mary last fall, i=
n the pool area there is supposedly a littlegirl stuck
there and you can ge=
t all the EVPs, and=C3=82=C2=A0 EMF readings and interactions to
verify it,=
 but that story (I heard) was started by Disney to bring in
tourists. There=
 were some that claimed to &quot;corss over&quot; hundreds of souls on
the QM, so why=
 is the QM still haunted?=C3=82=C2=A0 I don&#x27;t go the &quot;haunted areas&quot; to
rec=
ord.

I get voices like this, which seem to be pretty much ignored if it do=
esn&#x27;t
fit the ghost hunter expectation, but it shows how broadcast fragment=
 are
manipulated.

It&#x27;s not all cut and dried, and can be vary complicated.=
