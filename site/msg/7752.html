Thanks Frank.....I didnt even think about it that way, they have some new things to learn before they can do that...kinda a duh moment for me there.  I guess I just miss her so much and have so much that went unsaid and unanswered on her part that I didnt even think about that. but I know ur right...learning new things takes time.

My sympathies! That story seems all too common in this society. It 
may take some time, first the spirit has to realize where they are, 
and then learn how to communicate. They seem to hear our thoughts, so 
I'm sure your mother knows what was going on and how you feel.

just to be able to listen to a session would be awesome)
