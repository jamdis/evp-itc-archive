My techs Mike & Lisa are aware that they \nwill be using boxes in the UK and have assured me that they will help \nin any way they can.\n\nOn Saturday night I did a RS box session over skype with lee and \nDarren and introduced them to Mike and Lisa and they where shocked \nwhen Mike said hello Lee and Lisa said hi. They answered a few simple \nquestions and also acknowledged pulse radio and then very clearly and \nloudly after me saying goodbye they responded&quot;GOODNIGHT&quot; with the \nspread now of box research to Europe we are well on our way to \ndeveloping a worldwide research and communication network. I have \nbeen told that is exactly the goal and our friends on the other side \nare well pleased.\n\nso lets keep up the good work and take this research to the next \nlevel.\n\nBruce"}
