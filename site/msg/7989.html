Hi Bruce,
  I dont have a RS Hack yet...am trying to find one on ebay or somewhere cheaper cuz Im a broke girlie right now...but with the 125...is the hack the same as the 469 and 470, where ya cute a mute pin or wire?  Which box do you think works best for you?  Which box would be best for a newbie?  Ive done conventional EVPs with a digi recorder...ask a question and give about 20 seconds for a response...Ive gotten some good EVPs that way...but now I have to get a new digi recorder cuz mine took a dump on me lol.  But Id like to get into the real time communication, which I feel is the next step up from the conventional EVPs.  I found this group because I was looking up Franks Box on Yahoo search(after seeing it used on TV) and another group and Ive enjoyed everything Ive been learning and hearing...its so amazing to me that real time comms are possible...never would have known that if I hadnt had the Sci-Fi channel on that nite.

Hey guy's,

Here are a few from a session with the 125 a couple of day's ago.

For the new people that may be working with the RS 12-469 and would 
like to have a box without the clicking on AM and also an internal 
speaker and telescope antenna.

You should give this 20-125 a shot! I have gotten some of my best 
communication using this little dynamo. and it's very affordable and 
simple to hack.

If anyone has any questions please feel free.

Bruce
