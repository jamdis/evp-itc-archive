I appreciate you taking the time to listen.  I rarely do regular recordings anymore, usually just test sessions after i get something working.\n\nThing is, i don&#39;t ask questions in my test sessions and they seem to talk more and tell me what i need to know.  I should have shut up a long time ago and listen to Frank....LOL\n\n-Steve\n\n\n\n-Steve\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;tim_woolworth&quot; &lt;tim@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Very impressive.  It sounds like the scan is flying through the channels. \n&gt; \n&gt; Even though it was a test session, it was very active. There is a lot of communication in there that I don&#39;t have time to analyze right now but a few things really came across after listening to it only a couple times:  \n&gt; \n&gt; I heard the name Jacob several times.  \n&gt; \n&gt; You were also called out @.36 secs &quot;Hey Steven.&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Near the end, @.57, I hear the word &quot;listen&quot; said three times in a row with the last one being &quot;Listen To.&quot; followed by a &quot;It was Frank&quot; @1.00 then a &quot;thank you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a woman who is very prevalent in this test and she seems to be the clearest voice of them all.  She comes across with individual words, not statements.  Starting with &quot;Jacob&quot; at .01, she can also be heard saying:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;He&quot; .32\n&gt; &quot;Didn&#39;t&quot; .33 \n&gt; &quot;Open&quot; .40\n&gt; &quot;Let&quot; .50\n&gt; &quot;Us&quot; .51\n&gt; \n&gt; I find this clip very interesting and I love the way it sounds; I&#39;m very impressed with this modification.  Even the cycle over of the band provides very minimal dead scan time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tim\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  That sounds about a hundred times better than my junk, I think it&#39;s time to\n&gt; &gt; abandon what I&#39;ve been doing for years with great dissatifaction, and copy\n&gt; &gt; Hultay!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  F-S\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Jun 4, 2010 at 7:21 PM, &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  [Attachment(s)&lt;https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&view=js&name=js&ver=FTZabJ_H178.en.&am=!W6Hss3DXXsGRZb6MUfUyehccON9VaYSKSJB-BU4_O1DIOauX&fri#12905b3651cfb9c1_TopText&gt;from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; urkel23@ included below]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Trying for weeks on and off to get the FM working on these 150 radios.
