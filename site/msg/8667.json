I have the sweep working so far, hopefully tomorrow I can test the radio with\n&gt; external sweep to see if it actually works. The frequency display is now useless, so it&#39;s face down, and the power and band buttons will be added to a new front panel. I&#39;m not sure if I want to\n&gt; make this direct out, or make it just like any other box. The audio should be more better than anything I&#39;ve done so for, at least it sounded real good when I was using a manual control, but only\n&gt; could tune half the AM or FM bands wihtout the negative tuning voltage component. \n \n&gt;  The radio playing in the background is just C2C on a regular radio. \n \n&gt;  Frank-S\n\n  \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;   Windows Live Hotmail is giving away Zunes.
