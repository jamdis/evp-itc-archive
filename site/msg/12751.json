I think the draw to the box for ghost hunters is that it=\r\n &quot;appears&quot; to be a communication device with the dead. I&#39;ve been experiment=\r\ning a lot with the radio shack hack box and I have been getting a lot. For =\r\nthe most part I am using it to get answers to questions I or others have in=\r\n areas that have had strange events or just a paranormal nature to them. Th=\r\nere is definitely communication at a rudimentary level although I doubt tha=\r\nt all of it is=A0honest communication. I definitely see a lot of the tricks=\r\nter influence with these boxes. It can and does tell people what they want =\r\nto hear, and it seems to be reading the minds of the participants. Like som=\r\neone will crack a joke and the box will respond 2 seconds later saying simp=\r\nly &quot;joke&quot;. I was using the box in one area with a recently married woman an=\r\nd the word pregnant came=A0out of the box=A03 times during the 2 sessions. =\r\nI think the box was picking up on\n her conscious or subconscious thoughts. =\r\nI have not gotten the word pregnant since then. \n=A0\nSo far both radio shac=\r\nk types I have are working spectacularly for me. One of the more interestin=\r\ng responses I&#39;ve gotten out of the box is that it has said &quot;ovulous&quot; backwa=\r\nrds (it said &quot;75&quot; forwards), and that was just 10 minutes or so after I was=\r\n playing around with the Ovilus. I don&#39;t know exactly how The Ovilus is sup=\r\nposed to be pronounced but the box pronounced it like I spelled it above.\n=\r\n=A0\nSo what is going on with these boxes is extremely interesting and not r=\r\neadily explainable by science, but I lean away from thinking the communicat=\r\nions are coming from ghosts or demons, I am thinking it is just transferrin=\r\ng thought into messages or it is higher beings answering our questions (alt=\r\nhough not always truthfully). I have to say I was highly skeptical that I w=\r\nould get anything with these type of boxes but I have been fascinated by th=\r\ne results. I&#39;ve played what I am hearing for others and have done sessions =\r\nwith others, and these people have all been impressed too.
