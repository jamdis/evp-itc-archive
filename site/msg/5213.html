Bill,

I don't remember seeing much about it myself besides being mentioned in passing a couple times. If someone wants to get something like this started then we need to get a head count of participants. We need to get a commitment from each and announce the plan in advance to all those who want to participate. I'm all for these validation exercises.

Regards,

Frank R.

            I must have missed the announced beginning of the experiment. Between

travel and getting over 100 new emails per day it must have slipped

by. I often don't get to hear the posted recordings until several days

after they are posted and that's assuming they are still on the mail

server.



If there is a set date when new unlabeled files will be posted I'll

set my calender and specifically download and listen in a timely

matter then post what I hear. Hopefully this would be after the 20th

of this month.  -Bill
