Holy Cow, I leave for my daughters school event at 3:30 and I have too much email on this subject!
   
  First and foremost I was directing those who are in fact are paranormal investigators, in field research.  Many here are not!  I was in no way implying that Bruce, Steve, etc. were fabricating their audio clips in any way!!!!  I HIGH RESPECT BRUCE, STEVE AND THE the other on this board!  I am speaking from my experiences, and being in the line of fire throughout the years regarding cutting and pasting clips together.
   
  I don't care what you do to be completely honest, I just know that given the drama and know how nasty people can be, I will not cut and paste which is my preference.  Just because someone who does, given their reputation (such as Bruce's) I certainly would have no reason to question the authenticity of his work.  However, there are those who I do question, such as the post of Mr.Roundtrees photo's (posted the previous day) and given the manufacturing of those so called ghost photo's I would serious NEVER take any audio he produced as creditable. This is the point I was trying to make.  
   
  I will also tell you that a year ago upon listening to some of the files here, the first thing I noticed was that when I played certain files I could clearly see with the editing software that they were not raw audio.  I immediately formed an opinion that they in fact could be bogus!  That was my initial impression.  It wasn't until I formed a personal friendship with some of them that I know THEY WOULD NEVER comprise their integrity and that this specific research was extremely important to them.  I will be the first to admit that I was very wrong, but I did base my judgment given what I saw.  Other may just do the same.
   
  The average person who happens upon this search who in fact has been subject to those who do not stand behind their research will not know better.  They too may just form the same opinion based on what they have come across in this industry. 
   
  Many I have had the pleasure of talking to outside this board, and I will tell you that it is an honor to be among good honest creditable people, who truly do care!  I know NONE OF YOU whom I have spoken with would EVER do this, but unfortunately there are those who will.
   
  I hope this clears things up, and people are not going to make a mountain out of a mole hill.

          Ron,
 
And anyone that does not have experience on this subject.
EDITING DOES NOT MEAN SPLICE!
 
If you splice something you are either adding or cutting out relevant sections to make the file say what you want it to say.
I don't think that is what Juli meant to convey in this post.
 
If every researcher that has or does use an editing program to clean up their recordings and files was to stop doing research right now
this group and all like it would be a GHOST TOWN ! 
 
Lets not let this thread get out of control.

Subject: For Juli Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Editing EVP- Are you Crazy?

        Hi Juli   Questions regarding you comments:  does the term EDIT=SPLICE?  Amplification and de-hissing is o.k. and not considered EDITING?  
   
  Also, it seems to me that something like EVPmaker and Speakjet sessions are in a different classification than say a live, remote assignment where classic EVP's are sought or where you are sharing sessions with the public or with clients?  It also seems that sharing sessions here is quite different than making your professional services available to the public.  Rules can be set for this forum.  Rules cannot be set for the public.  Have rules or guidelines been set here?  More thoughts.  Ron L

juli velazquez <ghostchasingfool@...> wrote: 
        For those of you who are paranormal investigators alike, you know the first rule of thumb is NEVER edit your clips!  If you want to be taken serious in this field and not under a microscope with the question of whether or not you in fact did actually get a voice and/or response and that clip is edited, don't bother putting it up for public display.  You can amplify it, take out the hiss, but you better not splice it in any way, cause your just asking for trouble.  
   
  I had this very debate with Bruce long ago.  I know first hand that if in fact its edited many question your motives behind why you in fact would bother removing the dead airtime between.  The very first thing that came into question when editing EVP from Frank's Box many moons ago (pun intended) that a certain person was in fact splicing his audio by putting the questions and response right after.  Many now consider him to be a fraud and this was just one of the reason built upon others as a direct result.  You are altering the clip, no ifs and or butts about.  It can therefore hurt your creditability as a researcher in the paranormal field.  Regardless with you save your original clips.  Everything you do comes into question.  You can clearly tell by the skip in rhythm as you play the audio vs the free flowing of the dial when it has been altered.  Real Time is real time people, not 15 seconds after the fact.  If you have to questions what you got...."If in Doubt, throw
 It Out".
   
  People, there is one thing that you have to remember.  The word of box research is spreading, and there are those who are implementing it as an additional tool on investigations.  This is not just some who are going to give up their current status as a ghost hunter to now slowly be a box researcher ( for that was never a thought for me).  I was hoping that through my research I could in fact incorporate it on my investigations.  Because of the radio fragments itself, there are many that do not support this research and believe we are reaching and grasping at nothing, and literally laugh when the subject of box research comes up.  Do you really want to give them an extra ammunition as splicing your clips?  I know myself that there is more that meets the eye in this line for communication, and I do stand proud and true of pursuing real time communication, myself, but cutting out the dead air is not just because you don't want to listen to it, or you can't fit it all is a
 lame excuse.  Use a different program!
   
  I personally have questioned many on their clips and have to tell you that if you truly want to be considered as a professional paranormal investigator/researcher that if you intend to use this protocol for you evp/box research clips, you stand to loose your creditability and the word fraud may just come into question.
   
  However, if you have nothing to loose as far as your reputation and or not in it to prove anything to anyone, be my guest.  There are many here that are not involved in the paranormal field and a prefer evp-itc researcher vs. other areas of the super natural.  If they are not putting themselves out there for God and Country to see, and are only doing it for your personal results and curiosity, and can could careless with others thing, then clip away to your hearts content!  
   
  Just remember, if someone who is currently studying evp and not box research sees and hears your clips, don't be surprised, if they start questioning your motives and box research all together!
   
  Just adding my 2 cents!
  Juli
