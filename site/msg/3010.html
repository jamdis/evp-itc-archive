<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I can tell you some of the real story of these two men (much abbreviated 
version).

Nikola Tesla worked for Edison for a while but they had a falling-out 
because Tesla thought of improvements to Edison&#x27;s inventions that Edison, 
due to ego or whatever, didn&#x27;t think much of.  Tesla also had a habit of 
ordering the most expensive chateaubriand at Edison&#x27;s expense when Edison 
took him out to dinner. They eventually parted ways.

Tesla happened upon George Westinghouse&#x27;s lab when Westinghouse needed 
repairs to a motor.  Tesla went into the shop and machined such a 
high-quality repair that Westinghouse was immediately impressed.  So Tesla 
ended up working for Westinghouse at that point.

Tesla had the idea of developing alternating-current systems for power 
distribution and Westinghouse backed it all the way.  AC was much more 
efficient than Edison&#x27;s DC power distribution systems because it lacked 
the heat losses in the power lines that DC systems suffered from. Edison 
stood to lose much if his DC power systems were discarded in favor of AC 
power.  So he invented the electric chair to demonstrate to the public 
just how dangerous AC was.  The first attempt at using it on a death-row 
inmate failed miserably; it didn&#x27;t kill him but amounted to torture 
instead.

Tesla went on to do his own research; much was funded by J. P. Morgan. 
That&#x27;s a whole &#x27;nother story. But he and Westinghouse remained friends; 
he and Edison remained enemies.

Tesla was a very bad manager of money.  He died in a hotel room in New 
York, with very little money at that time.

Another interesting anecdote - Tesla had taken to letting the pigeons into 
his hotel room, which the hotel owners didn&#x27;t enjoy but tolerated because 
of his notoriety. He had a favorite pigeon which sat on his phone.  He had 
said several times that &quot;The day that my favorite pigeon dies, I will 
die.&quot; And so it happened.

&gt; Okay-- in your opinion--what is all this Tesla/Edison stuff about? It&#x27;s 
&gt; getting as weird as as John Keel book around here.
