I simply hit the delete \nbutton and the post goes unread.\n\nI know we all everyone, put a lot of time and work into our research \nand when it falls through the cracks without even being presented for \ncomment, it gets disheartening.\n\nMaybe we should start a group for social and casual discussion \namongst members and have this one for hard research posts.\nThat way one does not conflict with the other.\n\nI know I sound like sour grapes, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one to \nfeel this way.\n\nAnd I know the comments will come that no one has time to read all \nthe posts or respond to all the files. I know all of this.\n\nThere is more to be said and more idea&#39;s on how to make the whole \nissue more amicable for everyone.\n\nI just want to get initial reaction first.\n\nBruce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n---------------------------------\n  Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
