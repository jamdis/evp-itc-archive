<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You might be amazed at how different opinions there are on how to use, and who can use, these kinds of radios.  Chris Moon, for instance, has declared there are only 30 chosen people who can correctly hear and &quot;translate&quot; the messages received via the Box.

Do you believe Chris Moon?

Frank Sumption has said that if not many can hear it or something similar, it ain&#x27;t real.  Under controlled testing, most messages people declare to hear are not heard by others (unless the person is first &#x27;told&#x27; what they are supposed to hear), and the rest are, like you said, is just plain old radio stations.

Do you believe Frank Sumption?

I have never heard an EVP that convinced me that there was a &#x27;spirit technician&#x27; on the other side.

Do you believe me?

Who do you believe?  If you want my opinion, do careful, controlled testing yourself, read about the scientific method, get some good minds to review your methods, and believe your results.  Beware those who claim that &#x27;testing does not work&#x27;: if it doesn&#x27;t work for them, and yet they still &#x27;believe&#x27;, that says something about their own credibility.

And if amidst a hoard of angry and defensive voices claiming it&#x27;s true, you hear one lone voice questioning its verity, the following story is something that may help you sift through the noise:

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; I did a search online for a Franks Box &amp; was able to purchase something 
&gt; &gt; they said was basically the same. It&#x27;s called a Soul Linx Ghost box (the 
&gt; &gt; back says radio shack).
&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know how to communicate, all I get is plain old radio stations or 
&gt; &gt; static. Nothing else. I feel like I bought a radio &amp; that&#x27;s it. Idea&#x27;s on 
&gt; &gt; what to do, please :(
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Denise
