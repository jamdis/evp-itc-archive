I have received what I felt I needed, and gave what I \nfelt I was to share.\n\nI guess all of us have our own role and path. My intentions are to \ncontinue following my inner leading and experiment/create, \naccordingly. That is my guide, always has been, yet I know it most \nlikely will differ from others - that&#39;s what makes us all different \nand interesting in my opinion.  \n\nI think it will be impossible to find one common idea, protocol, \nformat, etc within this group.  That&#39;s O.K.  If anyone would like to \nestablish a certain group of common protocol, ideals, etc, that is \ncertainly OK, too. I take no issue with personal opinions regarding \nany of this.  \n\nBest wishes to the group and all the experimenters...\n\nLC\nhttp://www.angelsghosts.com \n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank surprised me yesterday, privately telling me he might come \nback  \n&gt; to this list. I was hoping he&#39;d pop up today and there would be a \nlot  \n&gt; of joy. I was very excited this morning, for a few short moments,  \n&gt; until I realized I&#39;d already missed Frank&#39;s return *and* his \ndeparture.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know if he will come back again. And I won&#39;t try to \nconvince  \n&gt; him.\n&gt; \n&gt; But if Frank does come back, I hope you all can understand that \nyou  \n&gt; are all in the same place at this time *because of Frank.*\n&gt; \n&gt; He doesn&#39;t owe anyone an explanation for why he does what he does,  \n&gt; with whom, and for whom. He doesn&#39;t need to believe that anyone is  \n&gt; more special than anyone or more deserving.\n&gt; \n&gt; Things *are* getting a little messianic around here, HMO. And the \none  \n&gt; thing I can say from watching this field for 30 years is that  \n&gt; messiahs come and go and never really are. What is are the little  \n&gt; glimpses of life after death, in other dimensions, and seemingly \nall  \n&gt; around us, invisible. That is the *only* verifiable truth of this,  \n&gt; HMO: *Something* is out there and it will talk to you, if you let \nit.  \n&gt; Beyond that, we are in no way prepared to make definitive \nstatements.\n&gt; \n&gt; No one should be asking Frank for anything at this point. He \nshould  \n&gt; be free to gift his boxes on whomever he feels is the one that \nshould  \n&gt; have it--or not at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before anyone jumps on me, yes, I used to ask for a box from him,  \n&gt; because there were no other alternatives then and because we had  \n&gt; known each other on several other lists for about five years and \nwere  \n&gt; friends.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bu now there are alternatives--lots of them. Buy a minibox, like I  \n&gt; did. If that $400 price tag is too heavy, go to Radio Shack and \nmake  \n&gt; a hack. The radio, rechargeable batteries, and an adaptor cost us \n$70.\n&gt; \n&gt; No one should be asking Frank for anything at this point. He \nshould  \n&gt; be free to gift his boxes on whomever he feels is the one that \nshould  \n&gt; have it--or on no one at all. He doesn&#39;t owe anyone anything. He  \n&gt; already founded this feast.\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, enough out of me. I&#39;m going to go weep in my tea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt;"}
