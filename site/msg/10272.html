Frank,
 
If you didn't know..............  Steve does not want to and has  not been a 
colleague of Bruce's in quite a while.  Steve does not  appreciate being named 
in any of Bruce's emails regardless of what the subject  matter is.  It 
honestly pisses him off but he has been quiet about it until  now.    Steve finds 
it personally offensive to even to be names  in the same letter as Bruce.
 
I just thought you should know how he really feels.
 
Jeff
