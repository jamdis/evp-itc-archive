<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Welcome, Rob!

Very cool ideas (and programs).  Regan knocked it out of the park 
with her ability, huh?  Cool... ;)

&gt; Hello All:
&gt; 
&gt; I am Rob Fitzgerald and I host the Dead Science Show at
&gt; www.deadscience.com.  I  I should be receiving my mini box in about
&gt; two weeks.  I would like to list my proposed method of 
documentation I
&gt; will be using for my sessions and get your feedback if you will.
&gt; First the mini box will be fed to a Zoom H4 so both the box and my
&gt; audio can be recorded in very high bit rate on two separate 
channels.
&gt;  The entire session will be recorded on a Sony DSR-200a dvcam 
recorder
&gt; with an audio feed from the H4.  I will also have my data logger
&gt; running and that captures my tri-field meter data and the magnetic
&gt; field surrounding the area, the air temperature and the gamma
&gt; radiation level present.  This is all saved and displayed on a 
monitor
&gt; and will also be fed to digital video recorder. Furthermore I will
&gt; have my thermal imager watching the session and also record that 
video
&gt; feed.  All feeds will be time code synchronized and captured. In the
&gt; end the entire session will be saved to a DVD for study and 
archiving.
&gt;  I will also of course keep copious notes on the session in a log 
book
&gt; and include my personal feelings and emotions from the session.
&gt; 
&gt; I know this may seem over the top  and not at all necessary for a
&gt; session to be successful, but I like to have as much data at hand to
&gt; both rule in and out all possibilities.  The sessions should also 
make
&gt; for some interesting shows.
&gt; Thanks for your time and for letting me in the group.
