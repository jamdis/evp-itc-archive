I have been a PI and researcher for many years and am very\n&gt; interested in this technology. I have heard a demonstration of the box\n&gt; by chris moon and he has stated that a message recieved by him from\n&gt; thomas edison has informed him that only 30 people on earth will be\n&gt; able to operate this box succesfully. Can anyone tell me if this is\n&gt; true or can anyone attempt research with franks box and be sucessfull?\n&gt; And if so how can I go about obtaining one?\n&gt; any help is appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt; bruce halliday P.I.T. paranormal investigating team of south new  \n&gt; jersey.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
