{"id": "778", "subject": "&quot;leave the box open!&quot;", "author": "Frank Sumption", "timestamp": "2007-02-28T16:39:26Z", "full_text": "I kept getting this nmessage for years, thinking it was the echo box they \nwanted open. I tried that a few times, and it made no difference. It turns \nout that if I leave the front panel of the receiver open, the feedback \nbetween the echo box mic, and the monitor speaker is almost eliminated. On \none of the mini boxes I drilled 3/8 holes in the cover to cut out feedback, \nin a recent system I raised the front panel on 1/2&quot; stand offs and that \nworks. So I do get some guidence from the &quot;guys&quot;, I just don&#39;t understand \nit.......most of the time!! Curiously, when I first got that message I heard \n&quot;Frank has a girl friend&quot;, which was false, then it seemingly changed to \n&quot;leave the box open&quot; both having the same amount of syllables. That was back \nin 2003. It really makes one question one&#39;s hearing!\n\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMortgage rates as low as 4.625% - Refinance $150,000 loan for $579 a month. \nIntro*Terms  \nhttps://www2.nextag.com/goto.jsp?product=100000035&url=%2fst.jsp&tm=y&search=mortgage_text_links_88_h27f6&disc=y&vers=743&s=4056&p=5117"}
