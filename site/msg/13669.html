inent, as well as the doomed part.

   There is a program out thereto seperate the a=

        You know the date 2012 comes from t=

        That's my hunch anyway and that what I am going with it LOL!

          The reverse is often more distorted, I think I'm just u=

           This is the stuff I've been getting =

st night. I included the forward, and reverse components. 

               =
    These are from the test I did to see if I could use a pre-recorded RAW =
audio tape in areas wherer there's no radio stations, sincve many insist on=
 going to "haunted locations" that have few, if any radio stations to use f=
or the raw audio. #48 has an aux input so other raw audio can be used.
