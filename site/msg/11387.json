I have a digital camera that can \nrecord footage. \n\nI have heard about water methods, crystal methods, using the TV \nscreen...\n\nI have tried to research how-to methods and really can&#39;t find step by \nstep instructions. While there is info in the Butlers&#39; book it seems \ncomplicated.\n\nI want a very simple, low tech method for capturing these images if \nanyone can give me a tutorial or some tips or direct me to info that \nwould be much appreciated! \n\nThanks! \nAngela"}
