I have not written much but have visaully followed this group over the past year. I have much experience in the realm of the paranormal. \n\nHere is the issue. Our home has an inhabitant that we cannot seem to remove. It does not speak to us on the frank&#39;s box nor will it communicate through either me or my partner, Jay. We are both mediums. It slams and bangs in the house almost ceaselessly at night. It hits the walls, windows, the tv, the bedside tables and the doors. I am at a loss as to how to otherwise communicate because as I said with the 2 boxes we have, it won&#39;t speak.\n\nI am open to any and all suggestions. We have told it to go, tried many different suggested rituals and to no avail. It will go quiet for a day to three days after ritual work but begins again, only louder.\n \nPlease, if anyone can help or direct us to someone who can I would be most grateful.\n\nSincerely,\nAnnie & Jay C."}
