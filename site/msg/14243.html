&gt;  This type of file sharing is new to me. I have a photo album site for
&gt; sharing and uploading photos, but you can&#x27;t upload files. I didn&#x27;t know
&gt; there were file sharing sites until joined this group, but I had always
&gt; thought there should be.

&gt;  LOL Snowfire! Nope it was not you this time. Others should read before
&gt; they post because we just addressed this subject. Esnips is very easy to use
&gt; it has two uploading options in case you cant use the java application use
&gt; the single file uploader. Works alot like email upload attachments.
&gt;
&gt; If you need more help just holler and I am sure one of us will be more than
&gt; willing to help you figure it out. Posting from email as an attachment also
&gt; works just not so well for the very large file sizes. There are many other
&gt; file sharing storage places besides esnips. We just like the layout there
&gt; and the ability to share with friends including sharing storage space.

&gt; &gt; Well, it is not me, I took out the folder, and I removed the files, I
&gt; can&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; figure out esnips, it says it will take lots of files at once but, it
&gt; &gt; never sends a connection, to upload anything.

&gt; &gt; Ok I am getting tired of having to say this especially twice in a couple
&gt; &gt; days. Do not upload wav format files if you feel you must share it in wav
&gt;
&gt; &gt; format then use esnips or another file sharing source. If newbies cant
&gt; follow
&gt; &gt; the groups rules then you will not be allowed to upload files period.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Everything will be deleted and you may reupload in proper formats and
&gt; &gt; remember to respect the fact that this group of over 500 people has a
&gt; limited
&gt; &gt; amoyunt of file sharing space on yahoo. Only 100 megs split between
&gt; &gt; everyone. that is why we work to get around our limitations by attaching
&gt; files to
&gt; &gt; posts via email attachment or using _http://www.esnips.htt_
&gt; &gt; (http://www.esnips.com/) etcetera.
