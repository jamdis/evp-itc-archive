<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>We have ALL been around forever (or maybe even longer - time didn&#x27;t always 
exist) and we have been many things besides human in that forever and 
longer. And we have at least the other half of forever to look forward to. 
We will be many things besides human along the way.  I want one of those 
metal bodies again! They don&#x27;t die when you put them in sub-zero 
temperatures. You don&#x27;t have to feed them animals and plants every day. 
They last a lot longer time than these pieces of meat. Etc.

Maybe some day someone will develop those metal bodies of sufficient 
ability and agility here on earth so we don&#x27;t keep having to pick up 
another piece of meat once we lose one.

:-)

SO the question would be, has this thing producing the EVP been RECENTLY 
human (i.e. occupied a human form)? Like within the last few lifetimes 
time period? Perhaps it hasn&#x27;t ever occupied a human physical form, but 
here on earth that&#x27;s highly unlikely. (I didn&#x27;t say impossible.) A spirit 
unleashed of physical form is not human. Only a body can be human. But 
there are many other types of physical forms than human meat bodies.

&gt; Free your mind Zack! There are millions upon millions of beings you might be 
&gt; recording. Many of which aren&#x27;t honest, and see nothing wrong with telling 
&gt; you what you want to hear just to get you to talk to them. Many are just 
&gt; amazed as we are that we can hear them. :)

&gt;&gt; This was in the former Manteno State Mental Hospital in Illinois. A few
&gt;&gt; of them gave names. Someone who had access to the records looked up the
&gt;&gt; names later on and they were the names of former patients who died there.
&gt;&gt; The records gave the date and cause of death. They were NOT common names
&gt;&gt; like &quot;John Smith&quot;.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; How would anyone on an EVP know the names of people long forgotten for
&gt;&gt; over 60 years? None of us present did. It is all so fascinating ...
