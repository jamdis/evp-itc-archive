The whole point of my post, had you read it with a clear h=

No, I don't think I am being too=
 critical, but I may have expectations that are a little too high. =C2=A0I =
want to take my time with this. =C2=A0For my own understanding, I need to h=
ave a large sample size so I know not only what to expect to see, but what =
to look for. =C2=A0I have seen ITC snapshots from programs like this that o=
ffer full faces. =C2=A0I would be more inclined to believe in such an image=
 as opposed to, lets say. two dark lines that may or may not be eyebrows. 
=


Even in your example of the towel, you get half a face. =C2=A0If you have=
 half a face (on the vertical plane, not the horizontal) you can extrapolat=
e out what the entire face would look like. =C2=A0This is something I would=
 like to get myself and I would consider that evidence if it showed up in o=
ne of these programs. =C2=A0But, if you have something that looks like a fo=
rehead and that is all there is, then it could also look like a rock or som=
e other such object.


I am certainly hoping for results worked into box se=
ssions. =C2=A0Directing a session with intent, like saying "I am going to e=
xamine the sound waves of this communication in hopes of seeing your face. =
=C2=A0Is it possible you can show your face to me now through sound? " is w=
hat I am after. =C2=A0If a positive hit like this happens, then I will be j=
umping for joy. =C2=A0Another good example would be a name, lets say Tom, t=
hat occurs. =C2=A0If you get a positive affirmation that the name you heard=
 is present, then you try the same technique only you address Tom by name a=
nd get a face, that would be even better.


But, as it stands now, the face=
s as they appear are random at best. =C2=A0I would be more inclined to beli=
eve that when these faces do occur , they are going to occur with a lesser =
frequency than multiple images in a few seconds of audio like Ursula's exam=
ple. =C2=A0If this where the case, there would be dozens, and possibly hund=
reds, of faces during a ten minute session and I just don't think that is p=
ossible. =C2=A0This is why I need to look at several samples to find out if=
 this is the case or not. =C2=A0If these partialized faces occur in multipl=
es all the time, I would be more apt to discount it. =C2=A0But, if they are=
 a rarity affixed to only a few clips out of dozens, I would be more inclin=
ed to believe in them. =C2=A0Sample size is everything. =C2=A0It is like li=
stening to GBC. =C2=A0If you have never done a session before, you would be=
 inclined to believe every stray radio signal is a communication. =C2=A0Onl=
y by continued practice (expanding your sample size) can you start to
 rule=
 out stray radio with any degree of accuracy. =C2=A0


On the other hand, I=
 am very new to this and I could certainly be wrong. =C2=A0I will continue =
to plug sound into the programs and hope for the best. =C2=A0


I really wa=
nt this to work. =C2=A0As you have probably experienced, when they want you=
 to hear something or know something, they make it very obvious while commu=
nicating. =C2=A0I am hoping they apply this same rigor to this new format t=
o show us that they are there. =C2=A0If they can, then the world of video a=
nd audio ITC will merge in one source and then the skeptics be damned!

I've seen live webcast of ITC sessions where GB output is=

It was on LiveSciFi which is run by Tim Wood, he also thought there was som=

So if anyo=

<DIV>I too have been aware of this at Keith's site for long,=

<DIV>The image I ever so briefly men=

circled.  As for your image of the man peeking out, I saw nothing ther=
e.  Period.   Did I say previously what I thought about the =
quality of the images in that photo?  No.  I politely kept it to =
myself because I do not like to differ with people or to deflate hot air ba=
lloons.  But there you have it, that is what I saw.  And to my kn=
owledge, that is the only time I have described what I have seen thus far i=
n your images other than mentioning the word "eyebrows."  In the one t=
hat had many circles, I saw one that looked like a set of lips and a chin a=
nd the rest I personally thought was matrixing.  Once again, did I saw=
 this?  No.  But you asked for it so there it is.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>=
</DIV>
<DIV>The whole point of my post, had you read it with a clear head. =
 It was all about my own edification, that I, and I alone, need to kee=
p plugging in files before I, and I alone, make a judgement about MY images=
 and whether they are real or not based upon the images they provide in con=
trast to the bulk of other files.  If you simply compare your one imag=
e with the many circles to the youtube file, I suspect I am correct in sayi=
ng that faces occur with much more rarity than your circle file and that th=
ey can appear fully formed.  Once again, I suspect, only, and I will o=
nly be able to tell after time.  Sample size is everything, and I thou=
ght I made that abundantly clear.  The post was simply about my proces=
s of learning rather than running out and saying look what I found when I s=
imply don't know what has been found yet because it is the first time I hav=
e played with the controls rather than seeing the end snapshots on another

<DIV>Why do you always jump =

on you or results, reread the post, and this time thinking a little more cl=
early about what is written on the page and not your own emotional backlash=

<DIV>No, I don't think I am being too =
critical, but I may have expectations that are a little too high.  I w=
ant to take my time with this.  For my own understanding, I need to ha=
ve a large sample size so I know not only what to expect to see, but what t=
o look for.  I have seen ITC snapshots from programs like this that of=
fer full faces.  I would be more inclined to believe in such an image =
as opposed to, lets say. two dark lines that may or may not be eyebrows. 
<=
DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Even in your example of the towel, you get half a face.=
  If you have half a face (on the vertical plane, not the horizontal) =
you can extrapolate out what the entire face would look like.  This is=
 something I would like to get myself and I would consider that evidence if=
 it showed up in one of these programs.  But, if you have something th=
at looks like a forehead and that is all there is, then it could also look =
like a rock or some other such object.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>I am cert=
ainly hoping for results worked into box sessions.  Directing a sessio=
n with intent, like saying "I am going to examine the sound waves of this c=
ommunication in hopes of seeing your face.  Is it possible you can sho=
w your face to me now through sound? " is what I am after.  If a posit=
ive hit like this happens, then I will be jumping for joy.  Another go=
od example would be a name, lets say Tom, that occurs.  If you get a p=
ositive affirmation that the name you heard is present, then you try the sa=
me technique only you address Tom by name and get a face, that would be eve=
n better.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>But, as it stands now, the faces as th=
ey appear are random at best.  I would be more inclined to believe tha=
t when these faces do occur , they are going to occur with a lesser frequen=
cy than multiple images in a few seconds of audio like Ursula's example. &n=
bsp;If this where the case, there would be dozens, and possibly hundreds, o=
f faces during a ten minute session and I just don't think that is possible=
.  This is why I need to look at several samples to find out if this i=
s the case or not.  If these partialized faces occur in multiples all =
the time, I would be more apt to discount it.  But, if they are a rari=
ty affixed to only a few clips out of dozens, I would be more inclined to b=
elieve in them.  Sample size is everything.  It is like listening=
 to GBC.  If you have never done a session before, you would be inclin=
ed to believe every stray radio signal is a communication.  Only by co=
ntinued practice
 (expanding your sample size) can you start to rule out st=
ray radio with any degree of accuracy.  </DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>On=
 the other hand, I am very new to this and I could certainly be wrong. &nbs=
p;I will continue to plug sound into the programs and hope for the best. &n=
bsp;</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>I really want this to work.  As you ha=
ve probably experienced, when they want you to hear something or know somet=
hing, they make it very obvious while communicating.  I am hoping they=
 apply this same rigor to this new format to show us that they are there. &=
nbsp;If they can, then the world of video and audio ITC will merge in one s=
ource and then the skeptics be damned!</DIV>

<DIV> I think it's unrealistic to expect every file to have =
faces and images. These faces are often just portions, eyes and lips, some =

<DIV>I saw a couple which cou=
