Do not give in to these demons that are trying to make a buck from t=
he research we love and the equipment we use.
 
I have given away including=
 the shipping 5 RS boxes for free, 4, 470's and 1 469 all hacked by me.
I d=
id not do it to gain popularity or even wanted a thank you. my sole motivat=
ion was to bring new people into the research and 
in turn change someones =
life and perpetuate the idea of strength in numbers, in this case strength =
of communication.
 
To all new people on this board, do not patronise these=
 wolves that prey on the needs and wants of others. 
The RS 20 -125 is ever=
ything the 470 & 469 are and a little more. do not let the size or complica=
ted button arrangement scare you off.
the hack is as simple as the others. =

 
Do not buy any RS hacks from ebay, they are sold with the wrong energy a=
ttached to them, spirit wise.
That is why I and all other researchers shoul=
d follow the example of a great man to whom we owe all of this research.
Mr=
. Frank Sumption, who was in a position at one time to make a substantial a=
mount of money from his boxes and
was offered the opportunity on a silver p=
latter. But chose to follow what had been asked of him by higher entities.
=
And that was to keep the research pure for research sake. And that at no ti=
me was this equipment or knowledge there of
to be for monetary gain.
 
I ad=
here to this promise made by Frank to our friends on the other side and fee=
l that there is no need to give in to these box 
extortionists. If a box is=
 not attainable for a new person yet, the right way. Then it probably is no=
t their time yet.
 
I have coined a phrase and believe in it. "The research=
er does not choose the box, the box chooses the researcher"
Be patient, tho=
se that do not yet have a box. We will do all we can to help you obtain one=
.

Well, all I can say is the market is driven by BUYERS. If people ar=

fault the person selling for taking advantage =
of what the market will bear. Perhaps the 
people who do not have the tools=
