I&#39;ve never seen the whole show online .. We all sat in a \n&gt; circle (Me, Jeffrey Wands, my Team, and the Producers) .. We asked \n&gt; questions and recorded in complete silence and also as Jeffrey was \n&gt; speaking and so much of what Jeffrey said was validated in the Evp \n&gt; recordings. We had over fifty Evp&#39;s. The exciting part is that \nMaury \n&gt; doesn&#39;t sound skeptical anymore .. \n&gt; \n&gt; Just a small part of what went on was featured in the show ... One \nof \n&gt; the other segments had a little boy who sees a girl spirit who \nplays \n&gt; with the toys in his room. I was speaking to him backstage and his \n&gt; stories were amazing! He can&#39;t wait to move. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt; , \nLisby\n&gt; &lt;lisby@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Debbie--will the show be available in its entirety online?
