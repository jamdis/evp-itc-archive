He doesnt have  phD..he did not claim that..your making strawmen to

  In my humble opinion, this isn't a field> that can be targeted for

cientific research.
Thanks for bring honest..and thats my point.!The mere c=

evp..no matter what the quality has managed to move the field

where..??Exactly...nowhere.. Of all the fields associated with
paranormal p=
henomena..it has the greatest chance of moving forward with

Yes..so what..sceptics have to say that..they have o choice..so "we"=

dont do anything scientific..because some naughty sceptics will not

I did not insult an=

to suggest I should be m=

  Please do not assume we are unaware of anything.
I cannot believe an=
yone in any field would make that statement..
:)Amazing.So you knew about e=

experimenters mouth was moving unconconsciou=
sly did you..You knew about
the double blind experiments and faraday work e=
