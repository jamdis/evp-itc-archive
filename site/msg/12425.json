I do believe a fee for direct  \n&gt; &gt; expenses such as meeting room, coffee, equipment rental, gas  \n&gt; &gt; expenses for the coordinator etc. is not only appropirate but  \n&gt; &gt; esential for a group meeting.  I also heartedly believe that a \nsmall  \n&gt; &gt; fee for direct expenses is important for demonstrating \nappreciation  \n&gt; &gt; of value on the part of participants.  If zero is paid, it&#39;s too  \n&gt; &gt; easy to say &quot;yes, I&#39;m in&quot; and then never show.  The money is a  \n&gt; &gt; token.  That&#39;s been my experience.
