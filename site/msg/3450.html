Ok,
It takes more work, you need to add a pic chip ** i'll post details ton=
ight 
But you can now control the scan rate! right from the front control o=
n the radio.

It works this way power on the unit press up to scan up press=
 down to scan down!
after that up  increases the scan delay / Down decrease=
s the scan delay!

Just a bit more function !



I'll have all the details =
tonight on www.ghostboxhacks.com

  Hiya Bruce,
  Yeah all of the water fil=
es are sent thru the p1 process. It's the filter they helped to make for h2=
o. A few others can hear her voice tho I havent shared it with many. As alw=
ays I just post and either ya hear it or ya dont. I think male tones are mo=
re easily heard in general for most people I share with on the h2o sessions=
. As for the other methods, again it depends on what we can hear, what equi=
pment we are using, what speakers are used to play them etcetera. For my ea=
rs?..yes most definitely! Most of them are for our ears in tone and frequen=
cy we can process. 

  Better luck next time! Oh and I liked what ya said i=
n important message... it only echoes what I have been saying about working=
 together is much more productive than working against each other. 

  Harm=
ony is hard to find in this community, everyone has thier own opinions and =
is upset if others dont share it or if they cant hear what they can or if s=
omeone disagrees it often leads to "blows". Theres no need for all that, we=
 can all work together and we can all progress ourselves to higher levels. =
Sometimes it is alot harder to bite the tongue than run the mouth. And ther=
e are no experts in this field, even on the other side they scoff at the te=
rm. They are still in a process of learning, growing, becoming....same as a=
ll of us on this level of existence. Some have more knowledge than others b=
ut that doesnt mean we know it all or can be labled expert. 

  Work togeth=
er, learn from one another. Work against each other, not much learning goin=
g on in that scenario.

  Great advice!

Subject: [EVP-ITC] RACHEL FILES - I posted a bit of the Rachel collection f=
or all.


      As most! of you know by now as a child I grew up hearing co=
nstant chatter nightly from a man and a woman. Thier voices always sounded =
like a tv playing in the other room but there would be no television on and=
 no man and woman visible.

      When I moved some of the strangeness foll=
owed tho I never heard her voice again until I returned to that old house. =
Once I left again I didnt hear it again until I happened to start capturing=
 thier speech in evp research. Once I realized I was able to do this and pu=
mp up the volume, replay etcetera her voice returned. Only this time I ofte=
n hear her clearly thanks to technology being what it is.

      For the lo=
ngest time I had no clue who she was just that now and then I would hear "t=
hat womans" voice pop up in my evp. Also when I started doing this research=
 many spirits spoke of a woman named Rachel. Visiting Rachel's house, talki=
ng about her like she was an angel or a guide or even thier grandmother. On=
e day i decided to ask a simple question. What was the name of the woman wh=
o was speaking, and the reply I got quite stunned me. It was "her" voice sa=
ying the name Rachel. In some weird way it made some sort of crazy sense. A=
ll this time this spirit has been around me and I dont have the foggiest id=
ea who she is just that for some reason she has an interest in hanging arou=
nd me for over 30 years now. I never saw her as a negative just slightly an=
noying and maybe a bit spooky as a kid hehehe

      On one hand it was qui=
te disturbing growing up with that...on the other its quite comforting to m=
e now to have placed some details on that "figment of my imagination" I was=
 forced to live with. Shined a bit of light on the subject for me quite lit=
erally. 

      Anyways a short while back it occurred to me that I should =
start collecting her files together in one collection so I started to do th=
at. When I run across them in my archives I copy them over or when I record=
 a new one I will copy it over. I plan to do the same for Otto...he has qui=
te a number of files tho he rarely speaks the others are always quick to fi=
ll in details of what hes doing. 

      Anyway check it out when you get a=
 chance. I think if you can hear the evp at all that in quite a few you may=
 hear the similarity in her voice, her way of speaking, and her tone. I don=
t expect you to hear all of it but I think most will hear quite a few of th=
em.
