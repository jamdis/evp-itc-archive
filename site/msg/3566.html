Amazing.  I can't wait to find out how all this really works!  From the latest buzz, perhaps it's not too far down the line!
   
  Thanks for the input, Frank.  I realize I have to stop analyzing so much and just focus on being amazed.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Confused

      Hi, guys--

If anyone feels like enlightening a newbie, I need some clarification:

As a 'ghosthunter' I always wore headphones while recording EVP in 
the field so that I could hear the responses in real time. Now, 
while engaged in this structured in-home ITC experimentation, I am 
getting a lot of different results and hearing a lot of conflicting 
information.

My first voice I heard in real time through my headphones, and it 
came as a gravelly whisper in reponse to my question. My second 
voice was loud and clear but I didn't hear it through the headphones 
while recording.

From all of the talk about the various boxes, I am hearing that the 
great thing about them--and the allegedly dangerous thing--is that 
you can have conversations in real time because you can hear the 
responses while recording. But, from what I've read in extensive 
sources, I have garnered that the messages are IMBEDDED into the tape 
during the recording and cannot be heard until playback. 

But I HAVE gotten real time responses, so . . . since I have gotten 
responses in real time without a box, is it that the boxes increase 
the incidence of real time answers? Or am I trying to find solid 
answers to questions that are still not answerable?

Hope this makes sense, and thanks,
Ursula
