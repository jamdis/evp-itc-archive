<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>-I asked about her during my last session, but didn&#x27;t get a clear
answer. Now that we know she&#x27;s ready to help, I expect a lot of us are
going to hear *a lot* from her. She is a powerhouse! :)

&gt; Bill,
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks for the compliment on the files, but the credit goes to Sarah
and my spirit techs.
&gt; I&#x27;m only the listener.
&gt;  
&gt; I have heard a brief recording of Ms. Esteps voice and yes it does
resemble her physical voice.
&gt;  
&gt; I believe I am the first to have communication from her following
her transition into spirit.
&gt; Or I am the first to post files anyway. I hope to have much more
communication from her
&gt; in future sessions, something tells me I will.
&gt;  
&gt; If you or anyone you know is familiar with her family, you may want
to let them know she is ok and in communication
&gt; and where they can hear the files.

&gt; 
&gt; Bruce, these are pretty amazing. I&#x27;m not sure if you have listened
toknown recordings of her voice, but some of the responses even
soundlike her! I listened to her at length in Atlanta, then had a 45
minuteconversation with her afterwards and she had a distinctive voice
Ifeel I&#x27;m recognizing here. -Bill--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com,

really terrific session recently and posted a bunch of files. I &gt; hope
you guy&#x27;s don&#x27;t get bored listening 99% of them are great.&gt; &gt; I
received 5 concerning Sarah Estep and believe a couple where Sarah &gt;
herself.&gt; &gt; Also got one Claiming to be St. Patrick.&gt; &gt; I labeled a
couple with explanations, something new to explain what the &gt; file is
about.&gt; &gt; I hope you guy&#x27;s can give a listen these files are really
good.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt;
