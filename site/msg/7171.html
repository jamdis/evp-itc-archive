<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>---Hi Ann,

 It is on a Friday March 7th. I will ask our group leader if we have 
room for anyone else and let you know. We have like 12 or 13 in our 
investigation right now we want to keep it small but we can make room 
for one more I think, it&#x27;s not up to me though. I would be glad to 
have you come along with us so I&#x27;ll let you know. There is a small 
fee of $10.00  a person that goes for a tip to our guide that will be
watching us for those six hours 6:00pm to 12:00 midnite. Also any 
evidence we get must be turned over to the Manager of the Jenny Wade 
house afterward when we do the reveal. A copy of the evidence that is.
It&#x27;ll be a good one I hope. Take care I&#x27;ll get back to you soon okay.

Regards,

Ralph L. Smith
