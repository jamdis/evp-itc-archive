<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Same here -- when I play it, there&#x27;s no file to listen to but a tiny fraction-of-a-second snippet.  This also happens sometimes when I try to play others&#x27; files, so I always thought it was just me and my silly computer.

&gt; Check this one out, he says, &quot;In God, We Trust&quot; how can anyone doubt 
&gt; that these are spirits? I&#x27;ve heard my own mother speaking, my great Aunt 
&gt; Hazel Lilly with her husband Ralph say their own names, using their own 
&gt; voices. Why don&#x27;t you folks believe them? They are not from outer 
&gt; space, they are not radio fragments, nor are they monsters and demons, these are 
&gt; people like us, thathave left this physical world, to live in the world of 
&gt; spirit. How can any of you doubt when they are all around us?
