<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am loving this design. October hitting me pretty hard but will try
to scare up the jack to implement this design soon. thanks for your
hard work and posting easy-to-follow instructions.

thanks again,
Andy

&gt; Just put in several more pictures of the construction process in my
&gt; goldBox directory:
&gt; 
&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Marty%27s%20goldBox/
&gt; 
&gt; Added a SPST power switch to the 820 pcb just like explained in the
&gt; last method.
&gt; 
&gt; Constructed an echo box with removable input (so other future devices
&gt; can be plugged in and the box reused ), and attached amplifier with. 
&gt; Also used quartz plates for the divider walls in an attempt to
&gt; experiment in aiding in communication.  As always, I&#x27;m trying to use
&gt; slightly modded off the shelf parts for ease of duplication.
&gt; 
&gt; Parts needed: 
&gt; 
&gt; - Radio Shack 6&quot; x 3&quot; x 2&quot; project box
&gt; http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062282
&gt; 
&gt; - Radio Shack Deluxe Pillow Speaker (these are no longer sold on the
&gt; site, and on clearance at local Radio Shack Locations.  Of note is
&gt; this will accept a stereo signal and combine them to mono, instead of
&gt; just ignoring one of the channels as some mono speakers do.
&gt; http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2103574
&gt; 
&gt; - Radio Shack Stereo Amplified Listener (33-1096).  This is a small
&gt; amplifier with built in sensitive directional mics that are normally
&gt; used for helping hard of hearing people hear better.  You may have
&gt; seen cheaper versions on late night infomercials with spouses using
&gt; these to listen to the tv at lower levels while not waking their
&gt; husband/wife.
&gt; http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2104056
&gt; 
&gt; - 3 Quartz Plates 2&quot; x 2&quot; 1/8&quot;, from Prism Research Glass, Inc.
&gt; http://www.prismresearchglassglass.com
&gt; 
&gt; - Hot glue gun.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; To mod the pillow speaker, pry open the case with a screw driver. 
&gt; You&#x27;ll notice that the wires connecting the speaker to the volume dial
&gt; pcb are very short.  You&#x27;ll simply need to desolder the wires and
&gt; replace them with longer length wires.
&gt; 
&gt; To mod the amplified listener, you&#x27;ll remove the single screw holding
&gt; the case together and pry open the case.  You&#x27;ll see a piece of
&gt; cardboard with shiny &quot;silver&quot; coating over half the pcb.  Carefully
&gt; pull this off (I say carefully because its attached by a single
&gt; soldered staple and industrial hot glue, with wires hidden underneath
&gt; the cardboard.  The glue can pull the wires with it as you lift up). 
&gt; You&#x27;ll see it comes with dual mics inside, you&#x27;ll want to be careful
&gt; to keep the mic heads clean from any particles or accidental contact
&gt; from your fingers (always handle them by the attached rubber guards).
&gt;  The mics suffer from the same problem as the pillow speaker, short
&gt; wires.  You&#x27;ll simply want to desolder them and reattach them with
&gt; longer length wires.  I then reattach the protective cardboard piece
&gt; with electrical tape, which I also use to mount it to the echo box. 
&gt; Leave the back side off, as it won&#x27;t fit anymore with the new wiring. 
&gt; 
&gt; Use a hot glue gun to mount the pillow speaker and quartz plates
&gt; inside the project case.  Make sure the speaker is &quot;floating&quot; (by
&gt; gluing the foam backing of the speaker) and that the cone is not
&gt; touching any of the box edges.  Also with the quartz plates, be sure
&gt; to make sure and seal off the two edges of each plate that come in
&gt; contact with the box walls.  I put a coat of glue directly on the
&gt; plate edges, and then once seated in the box I run along the edges (as
&gt; you see in the pics) to improve stability.
&gt; 
&gt; Use electrical tape (or whatever else you like) to mount the amplifier
&gt; to the echo box on the side.   Make sure and mount it with the battery
&gt; compartment extended well enough above the echo box so the batteries
&gt; can be easily replaced when needed.  Bend the mic wires down so the
&gt; mics are inside the echo box.  The wires are sturdy enough so that
&gt; they&#x27;ll &quot;float&quot;.  If you want more support, take the foam discs off
&gt; the amplifier pcb (the mics were set in to these, and they are glued
&gt; on and should simply peel off) and stick them on to the walls of the
&gt; echo box.  Then glue the wires to them.
&gt; 
&gt; The quartz plates and the speaker extend about an 1/8 of an inch above
&gt; the project box edge, so the lid will no longer fit.  You&#x27;ll want to
&gt; get some sound proof foam, mount it to the lid, and then fasten it to
&gt; the box.  Besides sound proofing and protecting the wires from the
&gt; speaker and mics, it&#x27;ll add a little more shock protection to the
&gt; plates if traveling.  You can mount a Velcro faster or any other
&gt; method you want so that its sealed tight yet still removable.
