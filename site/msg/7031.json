It has to do with being deserving of a Frank&#39;s box and \nevidently!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Well do I have to spell it out? Start putting some time into your \nresearch\n&gt; instead of\n&gt; taking tantrums and maybe someday you&#39;ll have a Frank&#39;s box, But I \ndoubt it!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; &lt;http://free-paranormalinvestigating.com/%3C/div%3E%3C/div%3E%3Cp%\n20/%3E%3Cd\n&gt; iv%20class=&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; From: gjk1rrfan@...\n&gt; Date: Thu, 7 Feb 2008 19:21:50 -0600\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] First Files from my new Frank&#39;s box #29\n&gt; \n&gt; See what I mean.another (MAN) gets the box, lol...geez.\n&gt; \n&gt; Keep that to yourself please lol your good at what you do.
