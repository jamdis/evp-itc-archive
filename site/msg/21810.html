Now they are saying that Comet Elenin is not just a comet but a star  
cluster, here are new photos, if you all can get past the preacher man, and  
check out the photo he has now.  He says he got it right from NASA, why are  
they keeping this so quiet?  I wonder?   When Hail Bob or  Hailey's  went by us 
everyone was told, but they sure are not telling us  much now.  sf
