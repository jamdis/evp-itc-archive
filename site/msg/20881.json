How is the conection ? ... 11 to -12v or 0 . 4 to +12 ? .... I tried , and conecting 11 to 0 v , i got a triangular wave , but , i couldnt get a apropiate dc level , the minimum level i got was almost 14v , when i tried more low dc level , the wave lose the form , and the offset pot didnt go ok , it didnt have any effect in triangular wave ."}
