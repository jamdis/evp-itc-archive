I do clean up evps if I hear something and=\r\n can&#39;t make it out do to ambient noise.  So hear is my question.  When do y=\r\nou stop cleaning up?  Wouldn&#39;t to much enhancing &quot;taint&quot; the results?  To m=\r\ne the more enhancing you do the less convincing it becomes.  I hope noone f=\r\ninds this offensive, it is not meant to be I am just really curious.  The w=\r\nay I look at it is that if you have to do so much enhancing to find anythin=\r\ng, was there really something there to begin with.
