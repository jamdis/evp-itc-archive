listened and heard them clear, Tim.

&gt;
&gt; I get my full name called out, and Woolworth&#x27;s has&#x27;t had a store in the USA
&gt; for over a decade so I know that it isn&#x27;t radio interference when it
&gt; happens.
&gt;
&gt; Interestingly enough, during my sessions on Saturday, they were mentioning
&gt; you Frank.  I heard you name spoken many times and I know of no other Frank.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The following clip cracked me up.  The clip after that used your nickname.
&gt;  These were received on Saturday, I was participating in a fund raiser for
&gt; the local historical society that involved the public going on a ghost hunt
&gt; in two different locations across the street from one another.
&gt;
&gt; These clips came through during that hunt, two different locations
&gt; (&quot;Purple&quot; was in a house, and the &quot;call Frank&quot; was in a public library).
&gt;
&gt; The other clips are just some of the standard clips I get that mention my
&gt; name, same hunt on Saturday.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In your &quot;Echo chamber or not&quot; clip there is a male voice clearly saying
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Frank&quot; at nine seconds.
