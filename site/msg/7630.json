They sell em at big truck stops and even on ebay...they arent &quot;legal&quot; cuz it also boosts ur outgoing CB signal and the powers that be dont like ya transmitting over like 4 watts I think it is.  Anyways just thought Id toss that thought out there for ya.  I know when I use it with my 102 inch steel whip I get some great skip from all over the country....hmmm wonder if its possible to do a continuous scan thru the CB channels including sideband during peak skip time and use that in a box \n  hmmm...sorry rambling now. =)\n\nRon Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n          Yes LC, I bought a select a tenna but it must be set for one channel and I think it is only for a.m.  I have tested it but don&#39;t notice a difference.  I have seen some of the homemade coil deals on the web...can&#39;t do that.  Any ideas, let me know.
