<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m convinced all the responses we got on EVP were by patients who died at
the hospital. And some of the rsponses led me to believe they are as crazy
now as they were back then. So much for brain theories! They don&#x27;t have
brains now.

&gt; Now, see, this is what I wonder: if that&#x27;s not a dead person, what would do
&gt; that and why? An entity (who had never been alive) would have to pull that
&gt; bit of information about the former patient out of history somehow (or the
&gt; Akashic records or whatever) and then hope you followed up on it. Seems like
&gt; a lot of trouble to go through.

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know how you would &quot;test&quot; the entities. One of the best I&#x27;ve ever
&gt; &gt; goten though was at the former Manteno State Mental Hospital in Illinois.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was there with a group of about 8 people and the place was very active
&gt; &gt; that night. The building we were in is shaped like an &quot;H&quot;. We were in one
&gt; &gt; arm of the H looking across at the other and saw a shadow figure moving
&gt; &gt; around. We were just commenting on the figure when a voice came up in my
&gt; &gt; recording saying &quot;It&#x27;s Harold Wing.&quot; It repeated this once and then said
&gt; &gt; &quot;It&#x27;s Harold.&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now, none of us heard any of this while we were standing there and none
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; us knew or ever heard of Harold Wing. One of the people there later
&gt; managed
&gt; &gt; to get into the old records for the hospital and found Harold Wing was a
&gt; &gt; patient there who died of typhoid fever there in 1938.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am new to the group, I am a practicing Spiritualist but have never
&gt; done
&gt; &gt; &gt; any EVP work. How reliable is the info you are getting, have any of you
&gt; &gt; &gt; tested the entities/voices? What are some of the best messages
&gt; received?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
