&gt; Ok, thanks Frank, where does one get the solder?  Can I get it off an old
&gt; ring maybe?  Can I use this type of solder for fixing an old platinum ring
&gt; band, ?  Would it melt some platinum?

&gt;   Tin means just melt some solder on the wire, then you melt the solder
&gt; onthe connectin and stick them together.

&gt;&gt;   Well, i wasn&#x27;t able to get things back together, i know nothing about
&gt;&gt; taking radios a part, and i couldn&#x27;t get those little gray buttions back
&gt;&gt; into place, too afraid i&#x27;ll make things worse. I taped the wire but, it
&gt;&gt; doesn&#x27;t stay, i couldn&#x27;t get the little strap back on it, i have them
&gt;&gt; hollering at me, at how to fix it, lol,  &quot;tin&quot;  what do you mean by &quot;tin the
&gt;&gt; wire.&quot;  Sorry for my stupidity, but i shouldn&#x27;t have done this to begin
&gt;&gt; with, i some how did cut the mute wire though, but i have no idea how i did
&gt;&gt; that, probably just broke it, tomorrow i go to RS and see if i can get
&gt;&gt; something. Tks. sf

&gt;&gt;  They&#x27;re cheap, just run to Radio Shack. It wouldn&#x27;t be worth the postage
&gt;&gt; to mail one.  You&#x27;ll need a bit flux core solder to tin the wire with!
