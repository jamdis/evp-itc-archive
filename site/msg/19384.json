Doubting\nit&#39;ll work since the TV signals are supposed to be all digital, and the\ntuner is from the 80&#39;s. But what about the rest of the cable channels, and\nUHF. There is a delay with the newer TVs, it takes a few seconds to find and\nlock onto the station, so sweeping the tuning in the video box just gives a\nblack screeen. I dug up an RF modulator, and I&#39;ll try the old analog TV,\nhopefully tomorrow, if I remember.\n\n Video box is just a VCR tuner swept with the random voltage generator I\nused in earlier boxes, it was made in 2005, I just never did much with it. I\nwas in NY over Halloween and noitced they have &quot;analog Channel&quot; displayed on\nthe TV for some of the channels(while doing the channel flipping thing), so\nwas wondering what if.....Maybe I should send the thing to New York City!\n\n F-S\n\nI' e been wan ing o y he ideo box again, jus o make su e.
