Your wi=\r\nfe can&#39;t complain if people donate to your research could she? You have don=\r\ne so much for this field that some people should be allowed to donate to yo=\r\nu without expecting anything in return. What do you think? Jeff&quot;\n \n I hate =\r\nto ask for anything. I can afford what I need for myself. What I want to do=\r\n is make some printed circuit boards that have the sweep, and amplifiers, t=\r\nhen I would only have to add whatever tuner I want to use to form a system,=\r\n and I could make the boards available. I wouldn&#39;t mind putting this stuff =\r\ntogether for others, but the requests/demands are so overwhelming, there ju=\r\nst isn&#39;t enough time. \n \n Frank-S  \n_______________________________________=\r\n__________________________\nMore immediate than e-mail?
