<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I just started experimenting with Spiricom tones and a transmitter .. 
Honestly .. I have no clue what I&#x27;m doing yet .. I will post 
instructions as soon as I do .. I uploaded the first recording I did 
in Debbie&#x27;s Recordings/ Spiricom Tones ..

&gt; I formally thought &quot;hoax,&quot; too, until I found how easy it is for 
&gt; ghosts/spirits, etc to use these different devices we have today to 
&gt; communicate through.  
&gt; 
&gt; It&#x27;s almost as if the ability to talk to the other side has been 
&gt; there the whole time, or better yet, that the other side has been 
&gt; communicating with us the whole time, but we simply needed to 
&gt; become &quot;awakened&quot; to it...

&gt; &gt; When I first listened to the Spiricom samples several years ago, 
my 
&gt; immediate impression was: Hmm, it sounds like someone using 
&gt; an &quot;electronic larynx&quot; (speech aid device). This impression was 
&gt; strengthened by the observation that the buzzing sound often was 
even 
&gt; modulated by O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s own voice during the dialoges between him 
&gt; and &quot;Dr. Mueller&quot;! (Did O&#x27;Neill forget to remove the device from 
his 
&gt; throat while talking to his counterpart?)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And what about the &quot;13 frequencies&quot; that are supposed to be used 
as 
&gt; the &quot;carrier&quot; for the spirit voices? Why aren&#x27;t they audible in the 
&gt; recordings? And why does a mixture of the 13 tones created with 
&gt; Audition sound so different from the typical &quot;Spiricom buzz&quot;? - 
Well, 
&gt; if you analyze the frequency spectrum of the buzzing sound (this 
can 
&gt; be done with Audition etc.), you will find a lot of harmonics 
(peaks 
&gt; in the spectrum), and some of these harmonics more or less match 
the 
&gt; 13 Spiricom frequencies...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; To me, the entire Spiricom saga produces more questions than 
&gt; answers...

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks Guy, I have heard a few people mention that O&#x27;Neil 
hoaxed 
&gt; it 
&gt; &gt; &gt; but I don&#x27;t know enough about this to really pass any sort of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; judgement.  Looking forward to seeing your website.
&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In regards to the Spiricom story - I have to assume you&#x27;re 
&gt; referring to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Mark IV model as diagrammed/written up in the Spiricom 
&gt; manual (as 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opposed to the INCORRECT diagram made by Polish researcher 
&gt; Wojciech 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Drewniak...http://www.worlditc.org/k_06_spiricom.htm ).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While my research is still not finished (and I&#x27;ve been 
working 
&gt; on this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a little over 2 years), I&#x27;m leaning toward the Mark IV 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conversations as having been hoaxed by Bill O&#x27;Neil. HOWEVER - 
I 
&gt; believe 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he acted alone and that none of the other members of the 
&gt; Metascience 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Foundation were involved with this hoax. As to O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s 
&gt; motivation for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the hoax - I still don&#x27;t know. But I will also say that the 
&gt; veridical 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evidence that O&#x27;Neil claims to have received about Dr. George 
&gt; J. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mueller through clairaudience is amazing and it is tough to 
see 
&gt; how 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; O&#x27;Neil would have gotten this information given his finances, 
&gt; location, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the timeframe, etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve been promising to get my personal website up and 
operating 
&gt; for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some time now but have been busy. Hopefully soon. Then I&#x27;ll 
&gt; start 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; posting what I have found out so far.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; P.S. The recordings of the Spiricom cassette that can be 
found 
&gt; at the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GOS website ( 
http://www.ghostpix.com/spiricom/spiricom.html ) 
&gt; are very 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; poor. Scott L over at Ghostly Talk pulled much a much cleaner 
&gt; version 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; directly from a source cassette provided to him by Mark Macy 
( 
&gt; see 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ghostly Talk show archive noted as a &quot;Bonus&quot; and &quot;Repost&quot; for 
&gt; August 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 22, 2006: http://www.ghostlytalk.com/node/616 ).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     I&#x27;m new on this group. Not too sure whether this topic 
&gt; was 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussed already or not but I wanted to get your oppinion 
on 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiricon device.  Does anyone know more about it?
