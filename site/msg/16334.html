<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The unit now called Hertz was formerly called cycles per second, and is the
frequency of an electromagnetic signal. For instance, WLS radio in Chicago
operates on a frequency of 890 kilohertz.

A Gauss is a unit of magnetic field strength. It is not a measure of
electric or electromagnetic field strength, only the magnetic component.

&gt; Recently someone asked me the following question:
&gt;
&gt; *[I am brand new to the world of paranormal investigation. I believe I
&gt; have a good grasp on what hertz and gauss measurments are, however am
&gt; confused as to all of the differences between them. Hertz has more to do
&gt; with the complete cycles per second and gauss is the strength of an EMF. I
&gt; guess where I am fuzzy is in my lack of physics. I thought frequency is also
&gt; a measurment of strength. I may not be making much sense here, but can you
&gt; tell me where I am missing somthing?]*
&gt;
&gt; My answer was that I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure myself but I think that Hertz
&gt; measures the wave frequencies of the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Gauss
&gt; only measures the intensity or strength of EMF generated around these wave
&gt; frequencies. Depending on the range of hertz, an EMF is generated.
&gt;
&gt; I told him that I would check around with other people in the field to make
&gt; sure.
&gt;
&gt; Was I correct?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!

The uni now called He z was o me ly called cycles pe second, and is he equency o an elec omagne ic signal. Fo ins ance, WLS adio in Chicago ope a es on a equency o 890 kilohe z.
 
A Gauss is a uni o magne ic ield s eng h. I is no a measu e o elec ic o elec omagne ic ield s eng h, only he magne ic componen .

Recen ly someone asked me he ollowing ques ion:
 
[I am b and new o he wo ld o pa ano mal in es iga ion. I belie e I ha e a good g asp on wha he z and gauss measu men s a e, howe e am con used as o all o he di e ences be ween hem. He z has mo e o do wi h he comple e cycles pe second and gauss is he s eng h o an EMF. I guess whe e I am uzzy is in my lack o physics. I hough equency is also a measu men o s eng h. I may no be making much sense he e, bu can you ell me whe e I am missing som hing?]

 
My answe was ha I wasn&#x27; en i ely su e mysel bu I hink  ha  He z measu es he wa e equencies o he en i e elec omagne ic spec um. Gauss only measu es he in ensi y o s eng h o  EMF gene a ed a ound hese wa e equencies. Depending on  he ange o he z, an EMF is gene a ed.

 
I old him ha I would check a ound wi h o he people in he ield o make su e.
 
Was I co ec ?
 
Thanks!
