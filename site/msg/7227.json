There&#39;s a\npsychic connection going on and that supersedes the actual audio\nfragments in many cases. It&#39;s almost like electronic scrying.  -Bill\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;misujoey&quot; &lt;Debbie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Steve,  I was finally able to play your recordings!

If everybody \n&gt; &gt; hears something different, than who&#39;s right?  I post what i think i \n&gt; &gt; hear and than when others hear something else, i can hear that too.  \n&gt; &gt; Why didn&#39;t i hear it the first time?  Also, until a clearer format \n&gt; &gt; becomes available to our spirit friends we will forge ahead with what \n&gt; &gt; we have.  It&#39;s very frustrating to say the least, i don&#39;t hear what \n&gt; &gt; others hear and they don&#39;t hear what i do.  It&#39;s a giant circle of \n&gt; &gt; confusion and mis-understanding.  Maybe it&#39;s just radio gibberish, \n&gt; when \n&gt; &gt; set at a certain speed makes our mind wander...who know&#39;s...right??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
