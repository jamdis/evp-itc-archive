I tried to tell you all before, I have an old  spirit trumpet, it's kind of=
 
beat up, but years ago, when I went to a  Christian/Spiritualist Church t=
he 
Rev. she was about 86 year's old then, she  used to have one of those 
=
things fly all over the place, and spirit could create  these ectoplasm  vo=
cal 
cords in it, and talk independently, I know seems  unreal, and grant, =
there 
are fakers out there, but Rev. Lee was real.  As  far as how they di=
d this, 
spirit this is, I have no clue, I only know they  could, it's made=
 out of 
light weight metal probably not even an ounce, mine is  pretty ban=
ged up.  I can 
take a picture of it if you like and post  it,  last night =
I did a silly 
thing, and put my little RS 125 inside it  while it's standi=
ng up, and stuck 
the mic inside it, and just talked, I got some  loud and =
clear voices on the 
PC, I don't have a recorder, I just use the PC here  i=
n the room, I'm going 
to try this again tonight, hopefully I can get them =
to  talk more, it's hard 
though because I'm going to need to use the mic t=
oo when I  ask them 
something, then carefully slip it back inside, if you =
ever get a  trumpet, never 
allow anyone to put their mouth on it's end, I =
don't know why  that is, it's 
just what I was told, I guess that is a big =
spiritual No,  No.
Ok, I got  a picture of it here, as you  can see it's pr=
etty banged up they 
are easy to make, but there is no guarantee  it will f=
ly for everyone 
hehe.sf
