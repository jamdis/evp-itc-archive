I have actually composed a log sheet for each testing session.  I believe Bruce is reviewing it to make sure I didn't leave out any important information that we should also be logging.  Once I get the final ok, I will up load it and you can use it to recorded your data.
   
  Thanks!

          Frank,

Since we're communicating with another dimension(s), then we should 
also note the time, weather, phases of the moon, any geomagnetic 
activity, solar flares, seismic activity, etc. in our area when 
conducting EVP sessions to see if we can determine when conditions 
are best for communicating.

BTW, that's quite a colorful set-up you have! It kinda looks like 
modern art. :)
