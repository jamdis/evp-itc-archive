I've listed several results that if we got them would be paranormal.=C2=A0 =

=A0 Just stories and a lot of "can you hear word X in this recording?"=C2=
=A0 As people have pointed out:

1) People are pretty good at hearing anyth=
ing in noise (like they are good at seeing shapes in clouds), especially if=
 you point it out first.=C2=A0 That's why, for better results, its best not=
 to label your files, or tell people what you expect them to hear.

2) And,=
 of course, you would expect to hear words when scanning the radio dial.

T=
hose don't really test anything paranormal, since they allow a very large s=
ubjective influence.=C2=A0 That's why I try to do experiments to remove tha=
t subjectivity: then we would have results that would make people who quest=
ion the origin of the voices - like me - look stupid.=C2=A0 So I don't know=
 why anyone attack me and my tests, since if they show something paranormal=
, they'd make me look stupid!

Maybe that's the difference between me and t=

not.=C2=A0 Those attaching me because I don't believe like they do will no =
long consider any evidence that does not match their beliefs, and will atta=

<div>Here is a short file, wher=
e someone says, "Scamp, Scamp," then Scamp barks. "yap."  This little =
dog belonged to my grandma, when I was about 9 or 10 years old, he was a Ma=
nchester Terrier, and lived with us for many years, and this is his bark fo=
r sure.  I'd know that bark anywhere.  Sorry, that I can't make i=
t any clearer, I need to get one of those better ghost boxes I guess. =
 RJ, spirits are just like us, they are not omnipresent like God, =
; probably why David doesn't want to play the guessing game, he has be=
tter things to do over there, and has said, they have thousands of people s=
tanding in this long line waiting to get into the Heavens, and He can't jus=
t drop His job and go to your house to see what you have over there, He did=
 tell me that first time what it was, and i sent it to you, but it was too =
late.  It's hard for me to understand them sometimes, He was also righ=
t about that little boy, Syler being
 killed, and where his body would be f=
ound, I don't know what they did about it though. sf</div>
