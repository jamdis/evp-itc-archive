I timed out a couple times watching so havent made it to the end yet but will try again later. Not sure why. So far the results are interesting. Great job everyone who participated. Each has thier own methods and approach and its nice to see people working together. Perhaps it will inspire others to do their own experiments.\n\nMisty\n--- On Mon, 1/19/09, M.A. Coletta (Mike) &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: M.A. Coletta (Mike) &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Video Part 3 uploaded (5 researchers ITC audio files)\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Monday, January 19, 2009, 8:54 PM\n&gt; Greetings fellow researchers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Part 3 of &quot;Voices From The Scorched Earth&quot; has\n&gt; been uploaded.
