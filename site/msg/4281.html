Michelle,

I don't think the local schools would allow a device that lets us "speak to the dead" on school grounds. Hell, most schools won't allow prayer. The Queen Mary is a large, steel faraday cage (no signals to very poor reception inside). The fluorescent lighting thing I don't understand because I record everyday under two of them. As I said before and it looks like I will have to keep saying it. It is the person not the device that will determine whether you are successful in this research. Any and all boxes are just a way of bringing the speech into audible reality, we are the medium. To argue over equipment or method is ridiculous.

Now if you are here to submit your research, learn from others research or are just interested in what is going on in research then by all means stay. If you are here as a promoter for anyone or anything please leave, we don't want the distraction. If you have a problem with an individual on this forum then keep it private in your email. If you feel threatened, intimidated or frightened by anyone here, email one of us moderators or Misty the owner and we will do what we can within the group (warning, expelling or banning).

Best Regards,

Frank R.

            Mike,

I don't know if he tried to hide the article or not. It may have been

a coincidence that it disappeared within hours of me posting what had

been said. It took me awhile but, I re-found it. I'm going to assume

that if he really wanted it to completely disappear it would have.

Although, writers are funny about their works. 

His stating openly that he'd like to bring it into schools... that's

plain crazy. All my thoughts on negativity aside, do you really think

schools and parents will allow someone to bring a spirit communication

device into the class? "Alright kiddos, this morning I'm going to let

you listen to the voice of your dead relatives and who ever else might

decide to speak. Oh, and by the way, sometimes they use profanity. But

don't be scared."

However, my point of contention remains the same. Children and high

school students should not be used as testing subjects. The attitude

of we'll "see what happens" is irresponsible at best.  

I do not know if Chris has tried the radio shack hack or not. I do

know that messages and emails are coming in stating no success. I do

not know the reasons for the lack of success. It could be as simple as

not hacking it correctly, lack of ability to hear the voices... It

could also just not work for everyone. I know that even REG has stated

here that she couldn't get reception on the Queen Mary in Long Beach

California nor in a radio station for C2C, for the mini-box and other

devices she has. That confuses me some but... Also, another researcher

claimed to be unable to use his device due to fluorescent lighting. 

It seems that the jury is still out. I'm watching closely. I just hope

that the whole children and high school student thing is reconsidered.

They need to be old enough to make an informed educated decision on

whether or not they wish to be part of the testing group.
