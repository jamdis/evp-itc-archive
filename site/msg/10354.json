What I&#39;ve noticed in some of my recordings is that sometimes mundane things, \nsuch as recorder movement, or brushing against a jacket, can sound like EVP.  Sometimes \nit is, and sometimes it isn&#39;t.  I do hear what sounds like the words &quot;help me&quot; in your clip, \nbut given the circumstances, it&#39;s really hard to say for sure.  It sounds very similar to \nbrushing against the fabric windbreakers are made from.\n\nOrdinarily I would say try to recreate it but that&#39;s pretty hard given you were on a plane.  \nFor example, one time I got what I thought was an EVP while opening my mailbox.  But \nthen I thought, nope, it&#39;s just the mailbox sound.  In that case, I was able to go back out, \nopen/close the door repeatedly in order to compare, and as it turned out, I think I really \ndid have an EVP because all the tests sounded only like a mailbox, if that makes sense.\n\nAs for someone in spirit being on a plane ... well ... my thought is this:  They go where we \ngo.  If you are on a plane, and someone connected with you for whatever reason saw an \nopportunity to make contact, then they might take advantage of that opportunity, just \nbecause they could.  \n\nI&#39;m not sure what could have been meant by the words &quot;help me&quot; because there is nothing \nto put them into context.  It seems like sometimes those in spirit we hear via EVP are \ntalking directly to us, and sometimes they are talking to each other and we are in essence \neavesdropping on them.\n\nIn a airport, I imagine it would also be more possible than normal to pick up on RF.  \nThough I admit, that doesn&#39;t have the sound of stray signal to me, but it&#39;s important to \nkeep in mind that our recorders can and do pickup misc signals from the air.  This is one \nreason why I personally think that context, and apparent meaningful responses are \nimportant in ruling out what is referred to as &#39;false positives&#39; (mistaking something \nmundane for something paranormal).\n\nSo, I guess given all my above ramblings, you might put this in the &quot;maybe&quot; file.  And \nmove on to doing other sessions where you can determine, more definitively, if the results \nbased on circumstances are strongly suggestive of the content being &#39;real&#39; EVP.\n\nJust my fifty cents on the subject.  ;-)\n\nWelcome to the wonderfully mysterious, sometimes whacky, but never boring world of \nEVP.  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rob E&quot; &lt;sunnswirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all, new to the group...I recorded this by accident on plane last \n&gt; year while waiting to take off, and trying to figure out an mp3 player \n&gt; my son just bought me.  I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s real or not...I remember \n&gt; no one was talking around me at the time...could it have been some \n&gt; random fabric sound?\n&gt; \n&gt; If it is real, how likely for someone on the other side to be on an \n&gt; air plane, and what kind of help would they need?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Rob\n&gt;"}
