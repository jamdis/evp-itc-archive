I would like it to work \nfor anyone. If anyone building this stuff needs any help, just ask. It does \ntake a scope so you can see what the signal levels are doing, and how much \nDC offset there is. The DC offset problem tends to swamp out the white noise \nso no random voltage is produced. I tried to compenate wth off set \nadjustment pots, but that doesn&#39;t solve the problem, but it works most of \nthe time. The off set starts at the output of the white noise transistor, \nand kinda propogates through the system, the coupling caps acutally making \nthe problem worse.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFixing up the home?
