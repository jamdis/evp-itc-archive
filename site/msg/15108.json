I say &quot;where&#39;d she go&quot; I was talking about a female Cardinal Bird that flew off a telephone pole. Is very low audio-should hear Big Girl though. Play 3 or 4 times with headphones will help. \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Jim%27s%20RR-DR60%20EVP%27s/I%20want%20my%20paaaw_big_girl.mp3 \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles\n\nRegards,\n\nclockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt;"}
