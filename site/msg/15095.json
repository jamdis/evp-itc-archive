Ive been researching this a lot and was overly excited to find a group that actually has frank posting in it.\n\nI&#39;m about to attempt to make my first box ( well i have made the ufogeek radio shack hack, but that was too easy).  I plan to try and make the one with a random voltage generator that&#39;s plugged into the Radio Shack 499, and if I can do that successfully, out to an echo-box before heading out.\n\nMy question to you all is if you could point me in the right direction to get up to speed enough on circuits and electronics via a website or book.  I have no experience doing this kind of stuff.  But im a quick learner and really want to make this happen.\n\nThanks for the help everyone,\n\nGod Bless and Good Results to you all.\n\nDavid"}
