I&#39;d heard about your work over the years and seen a pitcure of your box.\n\nI thought that you sounded grounded and you seemed to portray an air of, &quot;this is what was heard, make up your own minds&quot; .\nWhat impressed me enough to share with my husband, was that the &#39;messages&#39; were clear and concise, not in the least open to copious amounts of interpretation.\n\nI heard you reiterate that fact that you had the files for th public to listen to. But I think I fell asleep before they were played, or did they even get aired? \n\nThe interview intrigued me enough to seek out this list and learn more. \n\nDid I sense a &quot;Doomsday&quot; feel to your end of things, not at all, but unfortunately I was a little disappointing by George Noory&#39;s attitude which I sense to be a bit  &#39;patronizing&#39;. Something that I was quite surprised to  note. \n\nI was really looking forwards to hearing more supporting data.\nSo that is what an &quot;outsider&quot; perceived from your interview one I had been waiting to hear for some time.\n\nCan anyone tell me how long was Helen Gurley Brown&#39;s interview?  I know she is quite favoured guest on C2C.\n\nAnyways, I am here to learn what I can...\nDeb\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Well, our show time seems to have been cut short by what I think was\n&gt; favoritism by Noory- Murphy and I were not allowed to present anything to\n&gt; support what we were saying, and made to look like were doomsday crazy or\n&gt; something. No more firggin&#39; radio shows!\n&gt; \n&gt;  Remember what I&#39;ve said about self proclaimed experts in this field!\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
