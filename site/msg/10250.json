Bigger files can be linked to if uploaded to \nesnips.  Allow both .wav and .mp3 files that meet the requirement.  \nMaking them all mp3 will not solve the issue.\n\nThis way we do not have to convert everything to mp3 format when mp3s \nare not always opening up for everyone easily, either.  I have to do \na &quot;save target as&quot; to download and save it to my desktop first; wav \nfiles play automatically.\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank&quot; &lt;warrior18eii@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; A thirty second .wav file costs about 5mb to 6mb, in .mp3 format it \nis\n&gt; @ 540kb. Most of my message files, which are about 3 to 5 seconds\n&gt; (contain 10 to 20 words) are 27kb to 40kb. A huge difference!\n&gt; \n&gt; I think thats a pretty good measure to go by. If you are posting a\n&gt; single message file and it is close to 1mb, then its probably too \nbig. \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards, \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank R.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi, Misty.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am deleting some of my files, but is there a file size that is \n&gt; &gt; appropriate?  Though I posted audio in .wav files, they actually \nseem \n&gt; &gt; pretty small in file size.  I do not have time to convert these \nand \n&gt; &gt; wonder if they are OK the way they are?  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please advise...  :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LC\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Misty&quot; &lt;bulletbabea@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello all. It&#39;s that time again for me to remind you that the \ngroup \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is low on space (96% used) and actions will be taken. For now \n&gt; &gt; rather \n&gt; &gt; &gt; than delete everyones files I am asking that you convert your \nwav \n&gt; &gt; &gt; format into mp3 or smaller format before you post them to the \nfiles \n&gt; &gt; &gt; area.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One member using 10+ megs out of our groups 100 total megs just \n&gt; &gt; isnt \n&gt; &gt; &gt; going to fly anymore. So starting in May all files that are not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; within size limits and arent in smallest formats will have to \nstart \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to get deleted.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For those who cant convert your files I have programs that are \nfree \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to help you do that. For those that dont want to convert your \n&gt; &gt; files, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you can use esnips to post your larger files and share them \nwith \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; group as links in posts. For those that ignore my posts and do \nwhat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you want to anyway, your stuff will be deleted and your option \nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; upload and share here in group will be disabled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As I said we have 100 (one hundred) megs total in file section \nfor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sharing, please do not abuse your share of that space. As you \ncan \n&gt; &gt; see \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there are others who like to share too. Eventually we may just \n&gt; &gt; clean \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it out of everyones files but for now lets try and stick to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; compacting the things we upload and make use of places like \nesnips \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for sharing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Misty\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
