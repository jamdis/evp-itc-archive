I think most of us go thru periods of adjustment or different 
perception. Perhaps over time we get better, they get clearer, and 
equipment changes to suit our needs.

You are off to a good start, you can hear them, and you record with 
the right intent. That in iteself should attract a few more to speak 
with you.

Are these standard EVPs from an intelligent haunt of your own house? 
Are you utilizing a hack or any other type of box to capture these?
