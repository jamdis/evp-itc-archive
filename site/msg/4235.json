The fact is all these methods wo=\r\nrk, and they have in fact been used long before the box. \n \n This &quot;Research=\r\ner&quot; I was arguing with yesterday no doubt thought he had me convinced, and =\r\non his side. I can&#39;t go there after I get clear, coherent, meaningful messa=\r\nges with these other methods. I would like to keep the disaggreements frien=\r\ndly, and the discussions friendly, and I do consider the opposing viewpoint=\r\n, but it just doesn&#39;t hold water in the case of these alternate radio metho=\r\nds. That&#39;s why no interviews, and no in person meetings--as such, I can be =\r\nput into a postion of sympathy with a person when I don&#39;t actually agree. I=\r\nt&#39;s called lack of assertiveness, and I did in fact fail assertiveness trai=\r\nning in the community college! As soon as the meeting is over though, I&#39;m g=\r\noing to tell ya to bite me, and do my own thing anyway. \n \n I think we all =\r\nhave to be very careful when critisizing someone&#39;s work here, research, or =\r\ncomments--in public. So far very little of the EVP stuff can be considered =\r\nhard evidence, it&#39;s all what they call anecdotal, or it&#39;s what one or more =\r\nwitnesses experienced, but it&#39;s not repeatable--pretty much. Or you can&#39;t g=\r\nrab someone off the street, have them listen to voices and expect they&#39;ll h=\r\near it. \n \n I can&#39;t say my results are anymore valid than anyone else&#39;s&#39; bu=\r\nt I also can&#39;t accpet that anyone else&#39;s results are more valid than my own=\r\n. I am an independent researcher, I do this work on my own, it&#39;s more like =\r\njust a hobby. I don&#39;t sell anything, and I make nothing by endorsing other =\r\nproducts. When I say the Mini Box works, and the Radio Shack hack works, th=\r\nat is the honest thing to do, it&#39;s not cuz I get a kick back, as I get noth=\r\ning in return, except to know I did the right thing. \n \n As for this other =\r\n&quot;Researcher&quot;, I don&#39;t know what to tell ya. I can only ask, give us some fr=\r\niggin&#39; credit! There&#39;s some good peole here, and to dismiss us, and all or =\r\nour results is extremely insulting.\n \n As for the possiblities of danger wi=\r\nth this research, I&#39;ve been thinking about that. First I don&#39;t know of anyo=\r\nne else that has had any problems directly related to box use, and or paran=\r\normal work fro that matter.  It&#39;s like listening to some bible thumper swea=\r\nring the devil is really right there, just waiting to jump down your throat=\r\n, and yet, there&#39;s..... nothing. So far it&#39;s more threatening to cross the =\r\nstreet every morning (I usually walk to work). \n \n I pretty much work by my=\r\nself, I like it that way, and sharing what I get here. I don&#39;t wanna be TAP=\r\nS, or any other thing. I don&#39;t care who accepts my results, I do this for m=\r\nyself, for my own curiosity. I&#39;m not going to accept someone else&#39;s version=\r\n of reality, and I trust my own intuition.\n \n I&#39;m sorry if someone thought =\r\nI implied this shit came from  Edison, or anyone else. I don&#39;t recall that.=\r\n It&#39;s more likely that someone suggested it was Edison&#39;s concept, or whatev=\r\ner, and I kinda agreed it was like that for discussion--I don&#39;t know.  I kn=\r\now how it came about in my own mind, as problems are often solved, your own=\r\n subconcius mind will assemble an answer based on previous experience, and =\r\nI had worked with voltage tunable radios in the mid 90&#39;s, then I got intere=\r\nsted in EVP, then I used EVPmaker, then my own mind connected all the dots,=\r\n nothing mysterious, or other worldly about it. It&#39;s that same process that=\r\n takes place when you sleep on a problem, and wake up with a solution. I di=\r\nd not understand the process at first, but it&#39;s very common. \n \n \n \n \n \n Fr=\r\nank-S\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet=\r\n the power of Windows + Web with the new Windows Live.\nhttp://www.windowsli=\r\nve.com?ocid=3DTXT_TAGHM_Wave2_powerofwindows_122007\r\n--_130b5bf6-ab30-48e4-9e27-4f4fef35fa42_\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;\n.hmmessage P\n{\nmargin:0px;\npadding:0px\n}\nbody.hmmessa=\r\nge\n{\nFONT-SIZE: 10pt;\nFONT-FAMILY:Tahoma\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body class=3D&#39;=\r\nhmmessage&#39;&gt;\n&nbsp;Well, when ya get someone giving seemingly valid reasons =\r\nwhy these new methods are invalid, or questionable, then I turn on the RS h=\r\nack rig, and &quot;they&quot; are singing &quot;Purple&quot; across the band, and then the scan=\r\n starts again at the bottom of AM with &quot;DO NOT---QUIT----GROUP&quot; (the --- in=\r\ndicate gaps with no broadcasts or voice fragments), I&#39;m supposed to believe=\r\n that&#39;s just my imagination, that these things don&#39;t work.
