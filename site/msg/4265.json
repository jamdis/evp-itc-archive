I got mine yesterday and didn&#39;t seem to thrilled about \nthe results and gave another try tonight.  Tonight, i spoke to several \ndifferent people in their own voices and really have to give credit to \nMike and Lisa for making this communication keep getting better.  This \nreally is another valuable box in my research, as long as different \ndesigns become available i will test them all.  Every box is unique \nand offers different results, but they all work off the same premise \nof raw audio bits.  Real time communication is finally here and gets \nbetter every day, some day&#39;s frank&#39;s box is better and than some day&#39;s \nRS box...etc.  Depends on your surroundings, your mood, the weather \nbut all these devices have worked for me up to this point and i&#39;m \ngrateful.\n\np.s.--here is the link to the speaker so you can get a visual.  \n\nhttp://www.radioshack.com/search/index.jsp?kwCatId=&kw=21-\n549&origkw=21-549&sr=1\n\nYour going to love this wild ride and watching new people get involved \nand posted results makes it all worth it for me.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I just got my notice.

Anything else I can go out an get now? I am truly, truly  \n&gt; technology challenged, so guidance addressed to one like a toddler \nis  \n&gt; what I need.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt;"}
