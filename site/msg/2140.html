Hi James,

You don't have to be a full blown "psychic" to receive messages,=
 sense presences or any of that other associated garbage. Everyone to a cer=
tain extend is "sensitive" at varying degrees. "No one is born spiritually =
equal!" All you have to do to record EVP's is to accept the possibility tha=
t EVP is possible. That alone puts you in the mindset to receive.

As for t=
he technical aspects concerning EM and other measured anomalies, I have ext=
ensive experience in this field. Before I became a "true believer", I was v=
ery much a tech head. Nothing was possible without a scientific theory or l=
aw backing it up. A very narrow way of thinking, let me tell you. It took a=
 couple of physicists (Dr. H. E. Puthoff and Dr. Michael Ibison) to teach m=
e that science knows nothing beyond the ground is hard and water is wet. Ev=
erything in science is a "best guess" or assumption based on a few well doc=
umented tests. 

If you wanna know more about how EVP and audible speech is=
 formed in the physical atmosphere, look into the work of Dr. Orhan Berktay=
 and more recently Dr. Joseph Pompeii. Both are highly respected in both so=
nar acoustics, heterodyning and ultrasonics. Dr. Pompeii (formerly of Bose,=
 graduate of MIT) describes and demonstrates the production of a highly dir=
ectional, audible sound in three dimensional space. He can make musicor voi=
ces play in a two foot bubble, five feet off the ground where only you can =
hear it and a person three feet away will not. He does this by embedding an=
 audible signal within an ultrasonic carrier wave. Instead of allowing the =
air (actually water vapor) to demodulate the carrier wave naturally, he dem=
odulates it himself through technology at set distances determined by his p=
rogrammed settings. His invention is called the "audio spotlight"and is bas=
ed on the work of Dr. Orhan Berktay's equation for underwater sonar in reve=
rse.

While reading his research you will notice several uncanny similariti=
es between the anomalies produced by the "audio spotlight" and EVP.

Regard=
s,

Frank R.

That could be a possibility for some, but not for m=
e. I am about as 

psychic as an old tree trunk. For over a year and a half=
 I stumbled 

around various locations with my trusted crummy microcassette=
 

recorder trying to record an EVP. Then, on my last certification 

train=
ing investigation something dropped in front of me and rolled 

across the =
floor in total darkness in a very old building,---  It 

nearly soiled my s=
horts!



I recorded my first EVP at that location that night. But it was a=
 

grade C crummy one.



It was not until I began to use a multi-digital r=
ecorder system that 

I began to get a great deal of EVP's. I utilze 11 of =
them now on a 

typical home investigation. I have noticed a link between E=
MF fields 

and EVP gathering in the cases I have been involved in as well.=




I speak very loudly when performing an intereactive EVP session. 

This=
 might be a factor since I have recorded most of our EVP's in 

our investi=
gative group. But who knows? I am not developed 

psychically though. I did=
 have an experience at Waverly Hills in 

Kentucky three weeks ago on an in=
vestigation. Our team had recorded 

numerous EVP's by the infamous Room 50=
2. We are still analyzing 

them. I walked into this very dark room at abou=
t 04:00 hours on the 

3rd floor. Two team members were about 10 feet behin=
d me talking. 

The hair on the back of my neck stood up. I took out my dig=
ital 

recorder and got a moaning evp from it after I asked it's name.



P=
sychic? Or just plain luck?
