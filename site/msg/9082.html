Hey Mike,
 
I am the only one that I know of that has contacted the family=

member of someone in spirit that I recieved communication from.
 
The spir=
it person was the renowned EVP pioneer Sarah Estep
I recieved contact from =
her within days of her transition.
 
At the time there was a board member h=
ere who was aquainted with
Ms. Estep in life and verified the recognition o=
f her voice. They also 
informed me of her daughter and I was able to get i=
n touch with her.
 
I sent her a CD of all the messages I recieved from her=
 mother and
recieved a letter of thanks and her recognition of some of the =
phrases 
her mother had used in the messages. We still correspond from time=
 to time
But I'm sorry to say I have not recieved any further communication=
 from
Ms. Estep.

Amazing=
 I take a weeks vacation and come back to 350 notes, and see this one.
 
Bo=
th of your arguments are indeed accurate. 
 
But it is an added bonus to th=
e recipient or customer to hear their loved one's voice on tape rather that=
 by word of mouth from a gifted clairaudient, clairvoyant, psychic person. =
That is the icing on the cake.
 
What would bother me terribly is if any of=
 us researchers received a message from a spirit in which we could actually=
 make contact with their loved one to send the tape, and then to try and ch=
arge the contactee for the recording.  
 
In my opinion if any of us receiv=
e such a message with that clarity, we should send/give it to the contactee=
 free of charge as doing so is in a sense a spiritual gift from the spirit =
to the contactee, and we are just the messenger.  I have been researching t=
his concept, and I myself hope to one day be able to receive clear and conc=
ise messages which would enable me to contact the spirit's loved one to giv=
e them that message should they wish to receive it. And I gurantee you it w=
ill be free of charge. 
 
Have any of you received on any occasion enough i=
nfo from the spirits to be able to contact the loved one and give them the =
recording?

Hey Mike,<BR>
 <BR>
I am the only one that I know of that =
has contacted the family<BR>
member of someone in spirit that I recieved co=
mmunication from.<BR>
 <BR>
The spirit person was the renowned EVP pio=
neer Sarah Estep<BR>
I recieved contact from her within days of her transit=
ion.<BR>
 <BR>
At the time there was a board member here who was aquai=
nted with<BR>
Ms. Estep in life and verified the recognition of her voice. =
They also <BR>
informed me of her daughter and I was able to get in touch w=
ith her.<BR>
 <BR>
I sent her a CD of all the messages I recieved from=
 her mother and<BR>
recieved a letter of thanks and her recognition of some=
 of the phrases <BR>
her mother had used in the messages. We still correspo=
nd from time to time<BR>
But I'm sorry to say I have not recieved any furth=
er communication from<BR>
Ms. Estep.<BR>

<DIV>Both of your ar=

<DIV>But it is an add=

cording.  </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>In my opinion if any of us rec=
eive such a message with that clarity, we should send/give it to the contac=
tee free of charge as doing so is in a sense a spiritual gift from the spir=
it to the contactee, and we are just the messenger.  I have been resea=
rching this concept, and I myself hope to one day be able to receive clear =
and concise messages which would enable me to contact the spirit's loved on=
e to give them that message should they wish to receive it. And I gurantee =
you it will be free of charge. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Have any of yo=

 become "sickening?" I have a friend who is a <BR>medium. I mean THE <BR>&g=
