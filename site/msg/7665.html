<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Mike Edwards,

I&#x27;m definitely not extremely experienced with evp work, but have been  
able to muddle my way through problems similar to yours. I&#x27;m on a Mac,  
and my audio recorder saves .wma files which like all things Windows  
is a proprietary format.  I could not load my recordings into my evp  
analysis software, Audacity (free software). I was able to find  
another free program called Switch, which will read .wma files and  
save them into pretty much whatever format you need. If these programs  
are available for Mac, they must be also available for DOS computers.  
If you want more info on how to make clips beyond that, just email me  
directly and I&#x27;ll help you as much as I can.

I&#x27;m pretty happy with Audacity, especially considering its a free  
program. I also bought Audition for my Windows computer, but my Mac is  
more convenient for me (and more reliable, ha ha, a little dig there).

&gt; Here is my problem. I have a digital recorder and it saves the files  
&gt; in WMA format. I tried saving the file in .wav, but it wont let me.   
&gt; I have a 4 minute tape, but only need about 30 seconds of the tape  
&gt; as that is where I got my response. I am not very technical... This  
&gt; is frustrating as the EVP I got is really clear. i assume I can play  
&gt; the recorder and tape it again with sound recorder but then I lose  
&gt; clarity, I would imagine....  Does media player allow an edit of a  
&gt; file to take out x number of seconds and save to a .wav? have any  
&gt; ideas

&gt; Hey Mike,
&gt; If you want to do a quick edit...you can do it using the sound  
&gt; recorder that comes with Windows. Just go to the start menu, all  
&gt; programs, accessories, entertainment, sound recorder....you can set  
&gt; the position of the marker to before the question and answer and  
&gt; delete the first part and then put the marker so its after and  
&gt; delete the rest...just make sure to save the new one u make  
&gt; separately from the .wav file otherwise you&#x27;ll lose the whole  
&gt; thing.  I would make a copy of the .wav and save it else where just  
&gt; to be safe.  That&#x27;s an option if ya don&#x27;t know which program you  
&gt; want to D/L yet.  You can do some pretty cool stuff using that  
&gt; recorder too, speed things up, slow em down, play em backwards, add  
&gt; echo, etc.  Pretty nifty for just a basic lil thing.

&gt; I used my 12-469 for the first time this morning, and ran a 4 minute

&gt; do they see a white light?&quot;  After I asked this question the second  
&gt; time, I got a very distinct and crisp YES.  How can I save just that  
&gt; section of the file? Do I need to do that in the recorder, or can I  
&gt; do it in the .wave file I now have saved on my computer of the whole  
&gt; recording.
