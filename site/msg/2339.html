Hi Bill,=


Can you give me a reference to these studies I would be very interested i=
n reading them? I have always heard and read articles suggesting that low c=
ompression (ELF/VLF) waves in the 5Hz to 40Hz range caused physiological re=
sponses and not the magnetic fields. These frequencies resonate and produce=
 secondary harmonics that can cause changes in behavior as well. Such as ag=
gression, euphoria, jumpiness, depression and so on. 

There is an altered =
state of consciousness that will give a person the feeling of invisible pre=
sences and a heightened sense of paranoia, its called the Hypnogogic state =
and it is usually associated with sleep paralysis or the "old hag syndrome"=
. It can be reached from a point of total relaxation or a type of trance st=
ate.

Please let me know if you can find those articles, I really am intere=
sted in reading them.

Regards,

Frank R.

            We've been using the K II for about a year a=
nd a half and they're ok as a low cost emf 

detector. Moving any emf meter=
 too fast will likely result in false positives but a slow pan 

across a w=
all to look for electrical ground leaks will increase reliabilty. We look f=
or emf 

fields in excess of 7 milligause, the K II can detect of to 20 mil=
ligause. Studies suggest and 

controlled experiments verify that consistan=
t exposure in excess of 7 milligause can result 

in the precieved feeling =
of being watched or a presense by an unseen force. People 

sometimes feel =
it's an invisible intelligence but really it's the brains response to the 
=

synapse activity.  People sometimes interpret stimuli in a way that is fam=
iliar, in the case 

of high emf exposure we think it may be a spirit in th=
e room. 



But that's not to say the location can't be haunted as well. It=
's just that if a particular room 

has a lot of reported paranormal activi=
ty and there is a high emf field then you may want 

to consider that fact =
in your evaluation of the location. Interesting, there is alternate 

resea=
rch that suggest that exposure to substantial emf fields and the resulting =
increase in 

nerve ends firing in the brain that genuine psychic abilities=
 are possible. This was referred 

to in the book Spook by Mary Roach.



A=
ny device can be repurposed as a communication tool including the K II. Whi=
le some 

users believe that the involutary muscle twitches that occur whil=
e holding down the switch 

is sort of like what happens when holding a pen=
dulum, others prefer to have a selectable 

on / off switch on their K II. =
The manufacturer has started offering that option according 

to some of th=
