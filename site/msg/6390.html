<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Interesting, Ann. Not sure what to think about that one.  It seems 
like you may be dealing with ghosts more than spirits, as they do not 
sound enlightened, but frightened...jumping in and trying to convey a 
message to this side of the grave.

If the message is interpreted correctly, it would sound like a male 
voice repeated the word &quot;Estep&quot; (not knowing who she is), was 
frustrated to be asked about this person, and then proceeded in name 
calling and describing their own emotional trauma as the reason for 
his communication.  ;)
