&gt; Frank surprised me yesterday, privately telling me he might come back
&gt; to this list. I was hoping he&#x27;d pop up today and there would be a lot
&gt; of joy. I was very excited this morning, for a few short moments,
&gt; until I realized I&#x27;d already missed Frank&#x27;s return *and* his  
&gt; departure.
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t know if he will come back again. And I won&#x27;t try to convince
&gt; him.
&gt;
&gt; But if Frank does come back, I hope you all can understand that you
&gt; are all in the same place at this time *because of Frank.*
&gt;
&gt; He doesn&#x27;t owe anyone an explanation for why he does what he does,
&gt; with whom, and for whom. He doesn&#x27;t need to believe that anyone is
&gt; more special than anyone or more deserving.
&gt;
&gt; Things *are* getting a little messianic around here, HMO. And the one
&gt; thing I can say from watching this field for 30 years is that
&gt; messiahs come and go and never really are. What is are the little
&gt; glimpses of life after death, in other dimensions, and seemingly all
&gt; around us, invisible. That is the *only* verifiable truth of this,
&gt; HMO: *Something* is out there and it will talk to you, if you let it.
&gt; Beyond that, we are in no way prepared to make definitive statements.
&gt;
&gt; No one should be asking Frank for anything at this point. He should
&gt; be free to gift his boxes on whomever he feels is the one that should
&gt; have it--or not at all.
&gt;
&gt; Before anyone jumps on me, yes, I used to ask for a box from him,
&gt; because there were no other alternatives then and because we had
&gt; known each other on several other lists for about five years and were
&gt; friends.
&gt;
&gt; Bu now there are alternatives--lots of them. Buy a minibox, like I
&gt; did. If that $400 price tag is too heavy, go to Radio Shack and make
&gt; a hack. The radio, rechargeable batteries, and an adaptor cost us $70.
&gt;
&gt; No one should be asking Frank for anything at this point. He should
&gt; be free to gift his boxes on whomever he feels is the one that should
&gt; have it--or on no one at all. He doesn&#x27;t owe anyone anything. He
&gt; already founded this feast.
&gt;
&gt; Okay, enough out of me. I&#x27;m going to go weep in my tea.
