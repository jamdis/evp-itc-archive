Make a room into a Faraday cage!  One that I worked with in grad school in 
college was room-sized.

&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, Zack...the Farraday Cage might just what is needed for further research. The elimination of intrusive carrier waves signals would remove any doubt that the message received should�be authentic and not doctored or misinterpreted through our ears and brains. But this calls for�the highest ethical stance by the researcher with video being shot, etc.
&gt; IE, if you are not receiving standard AM or FM signals...then how are the voices being created? Seems like would be something worth pursuing over time.
&gt; Has anyone tried this method?

&gt; A Faraday cage is supposed to stop all electromagnetic fields from
&gt; entering it. They are useful in aligning equipment when you don&#x27;t want
&gt; any external RF present.
&gt;
&gt; You&#x27;re right; in a Faraday cage you would not be able to hear any radio
&gt; stations. Frank&#x27;s box probably wouldn&#x27;t work as expected in a Faraday
&gt; cage.

&gt;&gt; Mike didn&#x27;t cover the reasoning behind the Faraday Box in his YOUTUBE
&gt;&gt; video...is it to prevent unwanted signals to come through? Seems like
&gt;&gt; the Faraday Box could be self defeating... IE, if you are expecting
&gt;&gt; radios signals to &quot;come through&quot;, how can they?
&gt;&gt; Again, this leads back to the questioning whether it is the signals or
&gt;&gt; the noise and the effects that spirits use to communicate with? IF
&gt;&gt; spirits are using EVP&#x27;s to communicate! I am still open to the
&gt;&gt; possibility that spirits are. Doesn&#x27;t mean the spirits ARE...LOL.

&gt;&gt; This would seem to illustrate the divergence between schools of
&gt;&gt; thought with traditional evp and itc/rtsc. While using a faraday cage
&gt;&gt; to to prevent spurious and unwanted RF signals from contaminating a
&gt;&gt; microphone would be helpful for traditional evp, would it not be
&gt;&gt; counterproductive for box type ITC/RTSC? I am not trying to be
&gt;&gt; sarcastic or anything, I am just wondering if the idea here is to
&gt;&gt; ensure that if anything did make it through that it would most likely
&gt;&gt; be genuine? I would be afraid that the RF shielding would be too
&gt;&gt; effective thus blocking communication with a linear sweep box. If you
&gt;&gt; did get communication from a box in a faraday cage, it would certainly
&gt;&gt; make the skeptics and cynics be forced to present new arguments.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; While reading a book about spirit communication, there was a chapter
&gt;&gt;&gt; which referenced the Faraday Cage. So... after reading it I decided to
&gt;&gt;&gt; try out what the book suggested and placed my Radio Shack Hack 12-470
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ghost Box into my microwave oven (in the OFF position) and ran a sweep
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the AM and FM mode.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The AM mode did receive much less but a few audio snippets did make
&gt;&gt;&gt; their way through. The FM mode was a different story. No frequencies
&gt;&gt;&gt; at all made it through... just white noise as each FM frequency was
&gt;&gt;&gt; reached during the sweep.
&gt;&gt;&gt; As I always do... I made a short video of both modes being sweeped.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You can see it, here:
