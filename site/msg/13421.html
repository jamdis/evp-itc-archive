I didn&#x27;t know you were so close, keep me in mind for your next 
investigation.  I&#x27;m only in NJ.

&gt; We are in  southeastern PA, right outside Philadelphia.
&gt; 
&gt; I have sensed - seen and heard things all my life. My first clear 
memory of seeing a spirit was when I was four years old.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; I use various combinations of hacked radios to enhance our spirit 
communication sessions. When we get all three psychics together we 
really get some activity. 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; We will be at Fort Mifflin tomorrow night - there is a live 
broadcast from 6-7 on para-x..you should check it out, Mark (the 
host) from CCPRS uses itc and the puck.

&gt; LOL  Laurie  :)
&gt; 
&gt;    Our group (6th Sense Paranormal) had a meeting last night and 2 
investigations also. Nice to meet ya. From where do you hail? When 
did you first learn you could sense things others could not? BTW I&#x27;m 
not anti mediums...just those on TV. We have been using a Ovilus in a 
few of our cases....mixed results.

&gt; I agree, Larry! (and I am a psychic, lol)
&gt; 
&gt; I did not watch the show because my group and I were actually out 
investigating  something last night. As it is we are very busy with 
cases, box research and other research and projects. We do not, 
therefore, have time to watch other people,often pathetic wanna-be 
famous para-celebs, pretend to be what we really are.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; I wrote a blog about this whole thing - in this field, thos that 
can do..those that can&#x27;t sit and watch others pretend to do ti on TV.

&gt; I find most paranormal shows have become BS and I don&#x27;t watch any. 
Its all the same &quot;dog and pony&quot; act. Since &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; has become 
a hit &quot;everyone&quot; wants their own tv show or radio show. Its all &quot;look 
at me&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt;                  Sorry I&#x27;m very jaded on tv paranormal 
investigators,mediums and evangelists on Sunday mornings. In my book 
they all rank just a bit above lawyers but still below pro wrestling.
&gt; 
&gt;   (Hows that for an introduction?  :)  )

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have to admit that I thought I had seen the worst &#x27;paranormal&#x27; 
show on television already. I was wrong. Door to the Dead has 
exceeded my worst expectations.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Generally, I respect John Oliver&#x27;s work as a medium. While I have 
no personal experience with him, in the past he has looked and acted 
more genuine than not, the rolling of the eyes put aside for the 
moment.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; I do take exception to the characterization of the talking box as 
an Edison device. I have documented the history of Edison, ITC and 
EVP  [http://www.sdparanormal.com/EdisonWhitePaper.html] elsewhere. 
This is however the smallest concern I have with this show.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Prior to wathcing I had just had a conversation with a respected 
colleague on the West coast regarding interesting phenomena he and 
others are constantly observing in sites with phenomena similar to 
that on Door to the Dead. None of those measurements were made by 
this team. The use of thermal in this situation is not indicated as 
well.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; The real concern is that no attempt was made to help this family in 
a broader context. The skeptic did and said nothing skeptical as far 
as I could tell. Key questions were not asked (at least on-camera) 
that would reveal the psycho-dynamics of this family. We know fairly 
well at this time that PK phenomena is often centered on a focal 
person who can exhibit specific characteristics. That the team seems 
unaware of this is quite disturbing to a person like myself.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; A real research opportunity was lost in this case, as was an 
opportunity to educate the public on the right way to approach such 
situations. Continually sending the messages that phenomena is based 
on &#x27;demons&#x27; and &#x27;spirits&#x27; exclusively does nothing to further the 
position of serious investigators, which is perhaps most troubling of 
all.
