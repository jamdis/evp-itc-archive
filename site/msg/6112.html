<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ann,

 I sent you an email I don&#x27;t know if recieved it yet or not about the 
Chadds Ford case. Our group would be interested in seeing if we can 
help them. Also with any help from people in this group. Just wanted 
to see what you think about it. Our group pays strict attention to all
privacy. I have learned alot from a Podcast on Ghost to Ghost PM with 
Mike Coletta and his guest Bruce Halliday about the Ghost Box and 
opening a portal with the thing that I emailed about. The shadowy 
figure that followed me home that I think came through the Box. Oh 
well Ann have a great day and everyone on here too.

Regards,

Ralph Smith
