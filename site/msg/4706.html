<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks, Frank R.  ;)

I personally felt that message was what I have heard within me from 
those in spirit who speak to me, going back to the late &#x27;90&#x27;s...long 
before I personally became aware of any form of ITC.

&gt;   
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     
&gt;             This is my two cents regarding the box and the &quot;spread&quot; 
of it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I would think the goal would be to get people experimenting with it 
&gt; 
&gt; as much as possible.  There are always going to be people who shoot 
&gt; 
&gt; it down, attack, etc., but you will find others who experiment with 
&gt; 
&gt; it, or embrace it, as well.  Nothing that is new (or old) will ever 
&gt; 
&gt; be exempt from the attack of others, unless of course one keeps it 
&gt; 
&gt; hidden in a closet.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; With this type of ITC, it is ground-breaking IMHO, as the box is 
&gt; 
&gt; providing an avenue to &quot;open up the minds&quot; of those whose time has 
&gt; 
&gt; come to &quot;hear.&quot;  In other words, I suspect that only a given amount 
&gt; 
&gt; of people will be open to it; and that will be their time to 
explore 
&gt; 
&gt; the boxes and make contact with spirit.  That is the goal I would 
&gt; 
&gt; think: more belief by the populus and especially connection to the 
&gt; 
&gt; unseen, whatever that may be.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I just received a nasty e-mail from a TAPS lover attacking Angels &amp; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ghosts because I have written some articles with respect to their 
&gt; 
&gt; shoddy review of the Shadow Man pic at Moundsville (I am not 
dogging 
&gt; 
&gt; TAPS here).  I simply felt what was done by the TV show to the lady 
&gt; 
&gt; who took the image was wrong.  I also was attacked as to some of 
the 
&gt; 
&gt; EVPs on Angels &amp; Ghosts as being &quot;faked.&quot;  We receive submissions 
&gt; 
&gt; from all over the world and post those that are of interest 
(photos, 
&gt; 
&gt; videos, evp, stories, etc).  The only goal of the site is to post 
&gt; 
&gt; that which might cause others to consider the existence of spirit - 
&gt; 
&gt; the existence of more beyond the physical realm. Of course, we 
don&#x27;t 
&gt; 
&gt; try to post that which we know was faked.  Again pointing others to 
&gt; 
&gt; connect spiritually is the idea. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Is that not what the boxes will be first used for?  I could see 
many 
&gt; 
&gt; people split on this, but the idea of turning more toward the 
&gt; 
&gt; spiritual (whatever your definition of that is), would be a basic 
&gt; 
&gt; goal.  From there, everyone must have their own personal experience 
&gt; 
&gt; to become a believer, no matter how good the evidence posted from 
&gt; 
&gt; anyone experimenting with ITC.

&gt; &gt;  well ihave to agree here with Bruce that blog was written from 
&gt; 
&gt; someone tthan&#x27;s never seen the box or any box in action first 
hand . 
&gt; 
&gt; This is someone who has no experience what so ever in any 
&gt; 
&gt; researches  . Has not spent the time nor the effort 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; to ask the questions that need to be ask nor look for the 
&gt; 
&gt; answers .he a closed minded individual. who reached his conclusions 
a
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  based on wha he see from the window  of is apt. never venturing 
&gt; 
&gt; out to explore  the possibility that the world has to offer. 
Anyone  
&gt; 
&gt; that has veneered in to a realm
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; of the questionable  has experienced things that defy   logic.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;     If 10 yeas ago you said that the day was coming that i could 
&gt; 
&gt; take a pic with my phone and send that pic to someone halfway 
around 
&gt; 
&gt; the world in 10 sec  they would told me to have scotty to beam me 
up. 
&gt; 
&gt; but yet here we are.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   basically there our two type of people  based on that e out 
there 
&gt; 
&gt; dose that read and forum a opin. and those that step out there door 
&gt; 
&gt; and explore all possibility.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; And many  great  explorers were  outcast in there lifetime only 
to 
&gt; 
&gt; be  reg ionized 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; and ahead of there time later. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   we need to go along and present what we find and let it stand 
on 
&gt; 
&gt; it&#x27;d own  .and ignore these small minded  arm chair  criteces  .
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  just my thought on the subject

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  This only becomes an issue when new people get interested in our 
&gt; 
&gt; research and seek information from the usual paranormal community 
and 
&gt; 
&gt; are met with these type of answers and explanations. They quickly 
&gt; 
&gt; become disinterested and whenever anyone may mention box research 
in 
&gt; 
&gt; the future they convey the same closed minded ignorance that was 
&gt; 
&gt; spewed to them on their initial quest for answers.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Not to mention that anyone that does any serious research in 
this 
&gt; 
&gt; medium would I&#x27;m sure like to have their efforts recognised as 
being 
&gt; 
&gt; legitimate in their source and taken seriously with respect. not  
&gt; 
&gt; dismissed as nonsense or something that is written off as fake or 
&gt; 
&gt; delusional. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Frank I don&#x27;t want to start a long thread with all different 
&gt; 
&gt; people sniping back and forth I posted that snip it of a blog to 
let 
&gt; 
&gt; everyone know what the general consensus of our research is. And I 
&gt; 
&gt; did not even mention who the blog was actually about but I&#x27;m sure 
we 
&gt; 
&gt; all can guess. It&#x27;s that kind of stupidity that stops us from 
getting 
&gt; 
&gt; new potential researchers involved and adding their positive energy 
&gt; 
&gt; to our own, I have received messages from our friends on the other 
&gt; 
&gt; side that instruct that the more individuals that are involved and 
&gt; 
&gt; think positively about the communication we are striving to 
achieve, 
&gt; 
&gt; the stronger the communication will get. I view this blog attitude 
as 
&gt; 
&gt; not a personal attack on what I am particularly doing but just 
&gt; 
&gt; another extremely large hurtle to get over in bringing this amazing 
&gt; 
&gt; form of spirit communication to the forefront of paranormal 
research.

&gt; &gt;   This statement was taken from a blog that was sent to me by 
&gt; 
&gt; steve. He 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; came across it while web surfing.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is indicitive of the attitude 90% of the paranormal community 
&gt; 
&gt; has 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; toward box evp research.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I suggest we all memorise it because as box researchers this will 
&gt; 
&gt; be 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; our most formitable object.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The first thought that comes to mind about this whole &#x27;box&#x27; thing 
&gt; 
&gt; is 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; what are the chances that spirits would comunicate through such a 
&gt; 
&gt; box. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I mean there are so many different radio frequencies the chances 
&gt; 
&gt; that 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; anything would or would want to use the am or fm bands seems very 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; unlikely.
