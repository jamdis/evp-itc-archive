<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Been hearing something about April, but don&#x27;t remember a date. Did get &quot;jesus plans to out Mabus&quot; the other day. Stil alittel cautious since the March predictions, we got something, but tsunami was never mentioned, or nuke melt down. 

 Yet another self proclaimed--highpriced psychic saying everythg is just fine, nothing to worry about in 2012, ignore all the ancient prophecies, plus the modern ones....Not only that, I&#x27;m not to believe tne voices I&#x27;ve gotten for the last ten years. Stupid channeled horse crap. I hate it when people try to blow smoke up my ass. Can&#x27;t name names in this field.
