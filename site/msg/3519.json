The dictionary defines the word\n&quot;primary&quot; as being or standing first in a list. You offer that he was\nalso the first to understand how it was supposed to be used. Yet, now\nas more and more people weigh in with their own opinions you question\nyour initial judgment. The fact is that Chris&#39; opinion of how the box\nshould be used has never changed. He has held steadfast to his\nbeliefs. That, my friend, is an honorable trait in this field and a\nfact that should be considered. \nChris has also never claimed this technology to be his own. He has\nalways and will always give credit where credit is due. He does this\nboth publicly and privately. \nThe use of syntax here on whether we call it Frank&#39;s Box, The\nTelephone to the Dead, Maxi/Mini Box, or Granola in a can is of no\nimportance. Truly, because Edison&#39;s plans were never discovered there\nis no way to know for sure whether or not your plans are exactly what\nEdison was working on. \nThere also seems to be a bit of confusion on the role the\n&quot;technicians&quot; play in this along with another syntax issue ( could the\nwords network and technician be used interchangeably?). The\ntechnicians are not interpreters. They can provide assistance to those\nspirits too excited or otherwise unable to communicate effectively.\nAnd they, the technicians, also serve to assist higher vibrations come\nthrough (just as your &quot;network&quot;). They can also be of benefit when\nlower vibrations try to get through. \nYou state you heard a voice say &quot;Edison here&quot; and awhile back you had\nposted that you did believe it to in fact be Edison himself. Yet now\nyou say the &quot;supposed&quot; Edison conversation. \nAs for portals... I&#39;ve made my concerns clear previously known.\nHowever, I have witnessed the box being used in one location only to\nhave activity spike in another. I&#39;ve also heard many other stories\nrelated to dark or lower entities. So, perhaps you have had no\nexperiences yet but, others have and they are speaking up. \nYou repeatedly state that Chris is a good guy but then you say &quot;if he\ncan&#39;t use it in an honest manner...&quot; What could be more honest than\nsomeone sticking to the same beliefs he&#39;s held since day one? What\ncould be more honorable than stating his fears and providing what he\nfeels is a needed warning? \nFrank, isn&#39;t it possible that you two both bring something separate to\nthis device? You, the technology and science said. Chris, the medium\nand spiritual side. \nSomeone posted separately here about Chris&#39; ego. I can say this...\nhaving concern for the possible negative fall out to unsuspecting\npeople is in no way ego ridden. To assume that you know Chris&#39;\nintentions is full of ego. To claim that he only wants to prevent\nothers from having a device for selfish reasons, is ego&#39;s way of\ntelling you that you and everyone else &quot;deserves&quot;  to have what we do\nnot fully understand. Ego won&#39;t let you consider that because &quot;you\nwant what you want when you want it&quot;.\nBTW- when the word &quot;harmony&quot; is referred to here it is not a &quot;feeling\ninside&quot; like self esteem or some other warm fuzzy. It is about\nresonance, vibrations, that which will be matched by like resonance\nand vibrations. Harmony. \n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  I did, from the begining open this to anyone, and I am not amused\nthat one person would take the technogoly, claim it as his own, and\nattempt to make it exclusive to himself. For one person to say he is\nthe &quot;primary tester&quot; is inaccurate, he was the first that kinda\nunderstood how it was supposed to be used, or so I thought. I think we\nleft the &quot;treting phase&quot; some time ago, perhaps it&#39;s time to return\nbarrowed equipment?\n&gt;  \n&gt;  I wasn&#39;t quite finished with that e-mail-- I hit the send button in\nmy rush to get off to work. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  I put out a box use guideline thing a year or two ago stating that\nno one has the right to take my equipment and and claim their use\nsupercedes anyones else&#39;s use, or results.\n&gt;  \n&gt; So, to contiue...\n&gt;  \n&gt;  As a far as &quot;technicians&quot; I don&#39;t get any of that stuff, but---they\ndo talk about a network, and connection to our equipment. When I first\nmade my &quot;Ghostman&quot; box, last week, it wasn&#39;t working well, but a day\nor so later, it came to life, and one of the voices said it had been\nconnected to &quot;the network&quot;. Supposedly there is a similar connection\nmade to computers running EVPmaker. I&#39;m not sure if these &quot;network&quot;\nconnections are maintained if equipment is taken out for\ninvestigations, or demostrations. Of cousre, I can&#39;t say if these\nnetworks are a fact. I would think as maker of the box, these etheric\ntechs might want to give me, or others some hints.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  As far as the ghost box, or Frank&#39;s box, being a &quot;telephone to the\ndead&quot;, I think is very poor analogy, the old style phone system of\nEdison&#39;s day had operators, plural, not one person that recieved all\ncalls, then interpreted what was being said to other parties. That&#39;s\nmore of a master control schema.The old phone system didn&#39;t charge you\nan arm and a leg to talk to someone in the same room either! Some\nmight say these &quot;Technicains&quot; are the operators, but even if anyone\nesle could hear these voices, why do you need someone to interpret\nwhat&#39;s being said. I say if not many can hear it, or something\nsimilar, it ain&#39;t real! There is a certain kind of conatct, ion that\nthat your own mind uses the noise as a sort of psychic prop, you hear\nthe stuff in your head, it may be accurate and real inforamntiion, but\nno one else is going to hear it. i think that what all this supposed\nconverstions wiht Edison maybe.  I have in fact heard a voice that\nsaid &quot;Edison here&quot; but there was no other real information conveyed\nthat I could understand. \n&gt;  As for portals, demons and evil spirits entering the world through\nthese &quot;unauthorized&quot; boxes, I an only say, as the original mker of the\nbox, I have gotten voices cuzzing, swearing, name calling, and even\nthreatening, but nothing that has seemingly &quot;entered&quot; our world. Even\nthose &quot;threatening entities&quot;, when pressed to bring it, fold up like\npaper tigers. These beings and spirits already exist all around us,\nand at a higher level, so they have full access to this, a lower\nlever. Besides. There is that &quot;network&quot; that seem to allow for better\ncontacts, and kinda helps highter being to come through. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  I made these &quot;boxes&quot;! The idea was not &quot;Edisons Telephone...&quot; What\nI got was an assemblage of my own expereince and knowlegde, put\ntogether by my own mind as answer to my question of what else could I\nuse for spirit comuncation. All technology involved was based on what\nI had worked on in the past for radio experimentation. I had in fact,\na couple years before my interest in EVP, been experimenting with\nvoltage tunable radio modules removed from car stereos for AM DX,\nthat&#39;s listening to distant AM radio stations. I was hoping to find\nother talk shows similar to Art Bell, and there used to be one out of\nCincinati(?). The idea of using a random voltage to tune the radio was\nafter using EVPmaker, which uses a method of generating random speech\nbits for the entities to use. It was a small leap to apply the random\ntechnique to an anolog system. I am not the first to be focusing on a\nproblem, and have the mind provide an solution in complete form.\nNothing mystical about it. The fact is, after much work, and\nexperimenting, the tuning doesn&#39;t have to be random, a linear tuning\nworks much better. Yet another fact of  the box, covienently ignored.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  What really chaps my hide, as maker of the box, is to have someone,\nwho knows nothing of electronics, and technology completely ignore\neverything I say about the box, and presume to tell me how it really\nworks, how it should be used, and what is acceptable from it. This guy\nis so honest, he won&#39;t even use his real name, but huff and puff at at\nanyone that contradicts his use of my equipment. I say, as &quot;a Tester&quot;\nif you can&#39;t use it in an honest manor, bring the stuff back--testing\nover! Like it or not, the public has this technology, you can keep\npissing and moaning, trying to spread fear, or you could choose the\nway of Light. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Share life as it happens with the new Windows Live.Download today\nit&#39;s FREE!\n&gt;\nhttp://www.windowslive.com/share.html?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_Wave2_sharelife_112007\n&gt;"}
