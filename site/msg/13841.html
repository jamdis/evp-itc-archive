That's ok April - But I'm still happy to contribute to this test anyway I c=
an.
So if anyone would like to test their board, let's give it a try.

Just testing with me (my =
one lonely data point) is 
        not as subjective as one person asking t=
heir board open-ended questions, 
        but I agree it is also not as obj=
ective as it could be with more people, 
        or perhaps more randomized=
 data sources.

So while I still have my 
        one data point test open =
to anyone who would like to test their board, 
        we can also add futu=
re tests, with other people, or other "answer" 
        sources.=C2=A0 That=
 would add to the reliability of the performance 
        statistics, while=
 collecting more data.

But I think it's best to 
        do one test at a =
time, yes?=C2=A0 So, might as well begin with mine, for 
        those who =
are so inclined to begin testing, and then see where we go 
        from th=
ere.

                <td valign=3D"top">Asking the board open-=
ended questions, and 
                  interpreting the results, is subjec=
tive. Asking for a 
                  specific, predetermined number is not=
 subjective.  It is 
                  about as objective as you can g=
et. <br><br>I am not trying to 
                  prove anything, or rule o=
ut any possibilities.  I am 
                  suggesting a method to =
determine, statistically, how accurate 
                  someone=E2=80=99s=
 board, or methodology, might be.  Lets say I 
                  selec=
t two people, and in separate rooms, I give each a 
                  spell=
ing test.  Person 1 gets 100% right.  Person 2 
                 =
 gets 50% right.  Now, if I later give them a second 
                =
  spelling test, I can start with the theory that Person 1 will 
          =
        get near 100% correct, and Person 2 will get near 50% 
            =
      correct.  This doesn=E2=80=99t mean they will, or that they have=
 
                  gotten these scores in the past.  But statisticall=
y, it 
                  is a reasonable assumption at this point.  Af=
ter the 
                  second test, I can examine the deviation of the =
results from 
                  the first test, and update the statistics.&=
nbsp;  If the 
                  deviation remains small (if the resul=
ts remain similar), then 
                  I can more and more safely assu=
me that person 1 will have a 
                  very high chance of getting=
 a word right, and person 2 will 
                  have half that.  I=
f the deviation swings wildly, than my 
                  statistics may no=
t be very predictive after all.<br><br>The 
                  same is true =
with the board.  As you said, getting this 
                  number w=
rong doesn=E2=80=99t say past answers were wrong, or that 
                =
  future answers will be wrong.  And it is possible it 
              =
    could have been right by mere chance (though very unlikely: 
          =
        winning the lottery is more likely than guessing one number 
      =
            out of a billion).  What we=E2=80=99d have is one single 
=
                  objective data point.  It gives a starting point for=
 
                  reasonable assumptions.  As you noted, after more =
such 
                  tests, those assumptions may start changing.  =
It would be 
                  interesting to see how they change, if they =

                  do.<br><br>Different people seem to have different feeli=
ngs 
                  about the board.  Some believe it gives great 
=
                  results.  Some are suspicious, even dubious.  A=
nd 
                  there are plenty of opinions in between.  My tes=
t is not 
                  for those who believe it is statistically likel=
y that psychic 
                  tampering would occur, or that the board=
=E2=80=99s performance is just 
                  not testable, which is th=
e camp I gather you are in.  My 
                  test is only good f=
or that segment of this population who 
                  believes or wonde=
rs if the board is capable of giving a 
                  straight objectiv=
e answer to a straight objective questions, 
                  and that suc=
h performance is testable.  To address one of 
                  your =
examples, while it cannot show that an entity is reading 
                 =
 my mind if it gets the numbers right, it can conversely show 
            =
      that an actual entity is not reading my mind (or that it is 
        =
          not performing remote viewing, or that it is not predicting 
    =
              the future of what the right answer is when it is revealed, o=

o are not ruling out that 
                  testing is possible, and even =
desirable, when believing, or
