<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This is a fascinating capture. I hear it calling &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; as 
well as &quot;new box&quot;. There is something with the Box that links the 
operator to the hardware. Before I imprinted Box #21 it would call 
Frank&#x27;s name repeatedly. Like EVP&#x27;s, I usually get 4 or so syllables 
at a time so ecking out a message can take patience.
