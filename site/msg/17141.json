Details can be accessed from the front page of http://atransc.org or go to http://atransc.org/research/evpmaker_study.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; The study concerns information gathering using EVPmaker with allophones as the input file. Stefan Bion, of the VTF, has developed EVPmaker as a free program and has also set up the allophone file using SpeakJet voice synthesizer chip set. The first of the month for the next twelve months, a new target object will be set-up and participants are asked to discover what that object is using only EVPmaker. This is an important study, because properly used, the only way we know of that the answer can be found in \n&gt; \n&gt; the output of EVPmaker is if your etheric communicators manipulate the program to produce the required words. There are a few good examples of EVP collected using this technique in the Techniques section of atransc.org.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The results of this study will help us establish a dialogue with mainstream science. It will also help with &quot;proof of concept&quot; for the Digital EVP Platform Requirements and Digital Consciousness Array design requirements.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; You can contact us via atranscomresearch@... if you have questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your attention.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tom and Lisa Butler\n&gt; \n&gt; Association TransCommunication Directors\n&gt; \n&gt; (Formally the AA-EVP)\n&gt; \n&gt; ATransCResearch@...\n&gt; \n&gt; atransc.org\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; PS: Margaret Downey just told us: &quot;Posted on Facebook this morning by Jeffrey Wands:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I would like all of Debbie&#39;s friends to pass along this must see tv info - MAURY will air a special memorial show, a compilation of Debbie&#39;s appearances over the past few years, this Thursday, May 13.
