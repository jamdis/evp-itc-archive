<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>How would the wi-fi antennae work as compared to the current antennae?
Better or worse do you think? I guess I was thinking more along the
lines of recording directly into Adobe rather than broadcasting on the
web.

&gt;  Yeah, there was some discussion and work toward boradcasting live
streaming audio from the box onto the web, but all involved got kinda
sidetracked with other projects, but it hasn&#x27;t been forgotten. 
&gt;  
&gt;  The box is basically a swept radio tuner. Someone good at
programming could create a program to tune a radio on a plug in card,
making it sweep the tuning. You could do the same thing with a TV
tuenr on a computer card and get video images, as I&#x27;ve done with my
analog system.
&gt;  
&gt;  BTW, there is already a program which was the inspiration of the
boxes, it&#x27;s called EVPmaker, and it&#x27;s freeware.

&gt; 
&gt; Hey folks, been reading for a long time and am finally posting. I
havea question in regards to a dream a friend had...The dream was
vague but in it a woman in her low to mid 30&#x27;s istalking about her
father who has figured out a way to run Frank&#x27;s Boxthrough a laptop.
End of dream. When the dream was relayed to me, mygut response was
&quot;Oh! They are using the wi-fi antennae&quot;. Now, don&#x27;tget me wrong. I&#x27;m
about as technical as a shoe string but the dreamcame across as a
strong message. Is this even possible? The only real &quot;visual&quot; of the
dream was as the voices are comingthrough, they are showing up on the
laptop as well... as if AdobeAudition or some other sound editing
program is being used inconjunction.  
&gt;
