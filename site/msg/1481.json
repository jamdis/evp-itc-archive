It should be much more than simple one worders, and if \nthe box is functioning/used correctly, the mesaages should be whole \nsentences. Granted that there is a learning period of how to listen/hear.\n\nI&#39;m gettign stuff about the world wide meditation on the 17th of this month, \nthey are saying that it &quot;heals it&quot;, and that it &quot;stops the mountain&quot;, the \nmountain being the humungus asteroid that hits the planet in 2012. These \nstatements are very mixed in with the box audio, and if no one hears the \nstuff that&#39;s pretty much in the clear, the chance of anyone hearing this \nstuff is zero.\n\n\nFrank-S\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nhttp://newlivehotmail.com"}
