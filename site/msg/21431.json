There&#39;s mold, dust, dirt, insects, rat and\nmouse droppings that contain viruses and bacteria, lead based paint,\nasbestos, radon, and who knows what other toxins. No one takes any\nprecautions, they get this stuff in their hair, clothes, and cars, then\nbring it home to their children, freinds and families, then wonder why the\nkids are getting wierd deseases. Who is going to pay your health bills, the\nproperty owners, the event promoters? I don&#39;t think so! Still think it&#39;s all\nfun and games, a quest for fame and fortune?\n\n I wouldn&#39;t go ghost hunting without a full hasmat suit, including a\nrespirator!\n\n Just tell yourselves I don&#39;t know anything, bring your pregnant wife on\nyour hunts, or your newborns--couldn&#39;t hurt--right?\n\nFrank-S\n\nDoing ghos hun s mos a e going in o old, usually abandoned, no main ained--o cleaned buildings.
