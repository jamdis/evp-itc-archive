&gt; Yes--Sarah used reel-to-reel and occasionally cassette. I bought 
my  
&gt; first reel-to-reel from her husband, back in the day. Sarah had a  
&gt; bunch of them and her husband was always looking for them at yards  
&gt; sales to pass onto AAEVP members. He&#x27;d get them and fix them up. I  
&gt; still have the one he got for me. I used several back them myself 
and  
&gt; had three or four when I had to pause in taping for the birth of 
my  
&gt; son. It took me many years to get back to it...

&gt; &gt; Hi All, Been awhile since I&#x27;ve posted here, but was wondering 
about  
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; methods Sarah used with her reel to reel tape recorder (Technics 
or
&gt; &gt; Teac model - anyone know which???) as it seems she got MANY Spirit
&gt; &gt; voices or EVP&#x27;s this way. Not to knock, Frank&#x27;s Boxes or other 
Ghost
&gt; &gt; Boxes! Just a though! I may have an opportunity to get a $160.
&gt; &gt; refurbised Teac or Technics reel to reel tape recorder, but am
&gt; &gt; wondering IF I should get it or not (it&#x27;s a 1970&#x27;s model 
appearently)!
&gt; &gt; Comments/ideas? Thanks! =Judy= 8-D

&gt; &gt; Hi, Lisby!  Were you able to get some EVP&#x27;s on any of those 
recorders? Was it too time consuming to even get one or two? Just 
wondering IF I should just stick to cassettes &amp; Sony, and my digital 
recorder?   =Judy=
