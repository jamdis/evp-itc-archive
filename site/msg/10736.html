<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am not sure how it sounded live to you Frank but from the mp3 in 
your file the copper box is much cleaner and clearer sounding than 
the steel box. 

As soon as you get to the steel box on the file it sounds like it was 
covered with something which made it sound more muffled. I could also 
hear some sort of wind sound from the steel box.

&gt;  I wanted to compare the two boxes, I just finished a galvanized 
steel box, that scrap metal I get from work. I did the same as the 
copper box, try to select the best sounding speaker for it. The use 
it with #33. I like the steel box better, I think last night, the 
clearer voices had more to do with conditions thant he equipment. Or--
could it be the other way around, tonights conditions are poor for 
either box? It gets frustrating cuz ya can&#x27;t nail the damn stuff 
down, it seems to defy any attempts at definition. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I know, there was at least one person scrambling to make a copper 
box, that&#x27;s why I wanted more testing. I wish I could give some 
difinitive answers, but there just doens&#x27;t seem to be any.
&gt;  
&gt;  Then, get a voice that seems to be Raudive, I would expect some 
signifgiant difference with the copper box, I&#x27;m not hearing any thing 
any better. 
&gt;  
&gt;  BTW, the mp3s are in my folder.
