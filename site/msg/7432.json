I&#39;ve been apprehensive\nabout blogging here because if you don&#39;t regularly upload your audio\nfiles it results in being ostracized by a lot of participants here.\nAnd the fighting amongst some people is discouraging also. But I\nprefer video as you and some others know. So I quietly videotape\nsessions and share them with other researchers who aren&#39;t anxious to\npounce on anyone based on opinion or frequency of posting here.\n\n Suffice to say virtually every method of ITC is employed by me, and\ncall me obsolete if you want to but I still mainly use RVG maybe\nbecause it&#39;s what I have to work with even though most others embrace\nsweep. I&#39;ve got Hacked Shack and other commercial Boxes, but always\nend up going to an early style Box with RVG only. It&#39;s noisy, and\nsingle mode, but it&#39;s what I use most often anyway because of the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi all; There are alternatives;  1-EVPmaker, a free program that\nruns on a PC and performs the same function as the box, that is it\nprovides the raw audio spirits/entities use to form voices. It is in\nfact the inspiration for my boxes.  2-The Mini box by\nparanormalsystems.com. It&#39;s a direct output, linear sweep system based\non my boxes, and it does work.  3-Use the manual sweep mathod, take a\nradio that can be tuned easily by hand, tune the dial up and down\nslowly while recording directly from the speaker. Always announce you\nare doing an EVP session before you start recording. Manual sweep was\nthe basis for linear sweep that the Mini box uses, and that I have\nadopted for my boxes, and was first developed here on this group.  3-\nForeign language-Tune in a short wave broadcast in a language you\ndon&#39;t understand, and record directly from the speaker of the radio.\nYou can also use an internet foreign language boroadcast for the same\npurpose. See coffeepotghost.com for more information.  4-Radio between\nstations as a source of white noise. I like to pick a night when there\nlots of skip, stations fadding in and oput randomly, this is a great\nsource of raw audio. You&#39;ll have ignore the critics that cliam you&#39;re\nonly hearing broadcast fragments, you hav eto judge the result by\nmeaning, that is, does the message mean anything personally?   I&#39;m\nsure there&#39;s other methods out on the web. I suggest peole start wiht\nwhite noise, and work your way up. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  There is nothing magical about the boxes, it&#39;s a swept radio,\nnothing more. It provides a higher level--louder--audio that spirits\nuse to make voices, that is all it does!   I usually do not ask\nquestions when I do sessions, I think that biases the mind into\nexpecting, and maybe even creating the answers one wants the hear. I\nrely on the guides to give me what I need. I also don&#39;t do\n&quot;investigations&quot;, again I think it biases your mind into creating what\nyou want. I really doubt there is any haunting if no one is there to\nexperience it.   I know---what I say is to be dismissed as it doesn&#39;t\njive with the Hollywood version of the paranormal.
