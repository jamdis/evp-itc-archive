<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Our files area is getting a bit messy. Please help keep it more 
organized so that people have an easier time locating your files. 

*When uploading use one folder with your name on it to upload to. You 
can make as many subfolders in it as you wish.

*For sound files please use etiquette and convert your files to mp3 or 
something that is a smaller file size so that others in the future will 
have some room to share thier files too. Some of us also use Esnips.com 
to upload files to share with everyone. They give you 50 gigs and you 
can upload any file types you wish and size limitations are no longer 
such a problem.You can easily make your link available to everyone in 
the group by adding one link to your esnips account in the &quot;Links&quot; 
section of our group forum and adding it to your posts.

If you can correct some of this yourself please do. It will look better 
than me having to do it down the road when the files section gets full.

Thanks everyone!
