Thank you for that by-the-way!!!\n\nSo... yesterday I put the 12-470 video on there.  I&#39;ll put the 12-469 \nvideo on YouTube today.\n\nHave a great rest of the weekend!\n- Mike\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Funny!  You keep improving your system everyday!  LOL\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike, I saw you posted the 12-470 pin clipping videos on YouTube.  \nDo \n&gt; you have the 12-469 vids on YouTube, yet?\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason I ask is I am sharing your videos on AngelsGhosts.com \nthis \n&gt; month.\n&gt; \n&gt; LC\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve just posted a couple of pictures in my album of the new \nlabels \n&gt; &gt; attached to my hacked Radio Shack 12-469&#39;s and 12-470.  I think \n&gt; that is \n&gt; &gt; very appropriate... dont&#39;t you?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
