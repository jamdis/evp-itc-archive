I had been =\r\nthinking about \n  spiritual and harmonic energy connection between the spir=\r\nit world and \n  our physical world and contemplating how Mike & Lisa stress=\r\n the \n  importance of this state in the success of better stronger \n  commu=\r\nnication.\n\n  Then the idea of identical twins came to mind and the spiritua=\r\nl and \n  sometimes telekinetic bonds that they have been known to share. Th=\r\nis \n  idea raised two questions in my mind. \n\n  1. is this spiritual and me=\r\nntal energy bond between twins similar to \n  the bond we must develop with =\r\nour spirit counter parts to facilitate \n  better, stronger and longer susta=\r\nined communication. \n\n  2. twins in the womb are conceived when for whateve=\r\nr reason one \n  single egg splits into two separate eggs and those two fetu=\r\nses \n  develop independently of each other, but with identical DNA blue \n  =\r\nprints and identical physical characteristics. The question is.\n\n  Is their=\r\n spirit or spiritual energy also divided equally between the \n  two individ=\r\nuals that is existent as one spirit divided into two that \n  serves as thei=\r\nr individual spiritual energy while in the physical and \n  then after death=\r\n is recombined into a single spirit?\n\n  Or does the spirit at the time of f=\r\netal division become two separate \n  and distinct spirits that remain as tw=\r\no individual spirits after \n  crossing to the spirit world?\n\n  I propose a =\r\nresearch experiment involving certain questions to our \n  technicians invol=\r\nving this subject matter over say the course of \n  three 10 minute sessions=\r\n. At the end all participants will submit \n  their individual responses if =\r\nany and they can be compared for \n  similarity or dissimilarity.\n\n  Any res=\r\nearchers interested in this project please let me know, I \n  would like to =\r\nget started within the week.\n\n  Bruce\n\n\n\n\n   \r\n------=_NextPart_000_0099_01C85A96.FDEF93F0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3Dtext/html;charset=3Diso-8859-1&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16587&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY id=\r\n=3DMailContainerBody \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 10px; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FON=\r\nT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #000000; BORDER-TOP-STYLE: none; PADDING-TOP: 15px; FO=\r\nNT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; BORDER-RIGHT-STYLE: none; BORDER-LE=\r\nFT-STYLE: none; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; TEXT-DECORATION: none; BORDER-BO=\r\nTTOM-STYLE: none&quot; \nleftMargin=3D0 topMargin=3D0 acc_role=3D&quot;text&quot; CanvasTab=\r\nStop=3D&quot;true&quot; \nname=3D&quot;Compose message area&quot;&gt;&lt;!--[gte IE 5]&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace=\r\n prefix=3D&quot;v&quot; /&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix=3D&quot;o&quot; /&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;How =\r\nfascinating.&nbsp; I&#39;d like to be involved with this project.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Robin&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE=\r\n \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-=\r\nLEFT: #000000 2px solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt ari=\r\nal&quot;&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nB&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A \n  title=3Dmailto:paranormalinvestigating@... \n  hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;mailto:paranormalinvestigating@...&quot;&gt;bhali333&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV=\r\n style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A \n  title=3Dmailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogr=\r\noups.com \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com=\r\n&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Saturday, Januar=\r\ny 19, 2008 7:43 \n  AM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/=\r\nB&gt; [EVP-ITC] New Subject For \n  Research Sessions&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n =\r\n &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n  &lt;P&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have been thinking about w=\r\nhat our friends on the \n  other side have &lt;BR&gt;been saying concerning harmon=\r\ny, resonance and positive \n  vibration.&lt;BR&gt;While thinking on this and how t=\r\no achieve amongst us all, I had \n  an &lt;BR&gt;idea for a new subject of researc=\r\nh.
