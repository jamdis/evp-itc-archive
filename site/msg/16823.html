<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yep.  And I agree sometimes it&#x27;s obvious, and sometimes it isn&#x27;t, who is a cynic and who is a flake.  One sympptom of both seems to be they focus on emotional outbursts and name calling.  Like children, I suppose.

&gt; Indeed!  A Pseudo EVP Researcher might also be considered &quot;A Flake&quot; right 
&gt; in there with the tin foil hat crowd.
&gt; Pseudo Skeptics and flakes are opposite sides of the same coin.  One uses 
&gt; denial  of things that make him uncomfortable to ease his fears, the other 
&gt; embraces the &quot;unknown&quot; also for personal emotional comfort.  With both of 
&gt; these types you have a lack of information and data.  The Pseudo skeptic 
&gt; does not have enough information about what paranormal studies is about, 
&gt; and the Flake will often be unaware of or refuse to consider perfectly 
&gt; reasonable alternative explanations for what he finds.
&gt; 
&gt; Neither of these types are &quot;real scientists&quot;.   I tend to rag on the 
&gt; Pseudo skeptics though more than the &quot;Flakes&quot; and the &quot;Quacks&quot; (a quack is 
&gt; a purposely dishonest fraud) as the pseudo skeptics seem to be more 
&gt; prevalent and less obviously the fools they are---having undue influence 
&gt; over the general public.

&gt; That&#x27;s true, though the word for Pseudo-skeptic in your context is also 
&gt; &quot;Cynic&quot;.  Which also brings to light the &#x27;Pseudo-EVP-researcher&#x27;.  To 
&gt; re-quote your article switching the terms, it comes out just as true:
&gt; 
&gt; ... Indeed Skepticism is a vital part of scientific investigations, but 
&gt; it&#x27;s Skepticism based on consideration of the facts and  expressing a 
&gt; caution or difference of opinion is what is useful in the Scientific 
&gt; community.  A Pseudo-EVP-researcher is characterized by a person who 
&gt; clearly does not know the subject area other than through what may be 
&gt; termed &quot;common knowledge&quot; or, at best, a brief overview of the  tv.  A  
&gt; Pseudo-EVP-researcher&#x27;s &quot;opinions&quot; are based primarily on an emotional 
&gt; attitude towards the subject matter rather than what few &quot;facts&quot; he knows. 
&gt;  Its a psychological defense he uses to shore up his status, the validity 
&gt; of his work, and to cope with things that frighten him. 
&gt; 
&gt; A real EVP-researcher is a friend with a difference of opinion based on a 
&gt; genuine desire to help and sufficient data on the subject at hand to know 
&gt; what he/she is talking about.  We, as Scientists must always have a health 
&gt; dose of real Skepticism.  Otherwise we risk being the exact inverse of the 
&gt; cynic ---the &quot;FLAKE&quot;.  The Flake is the type who will believe anything. 
&gt; Just as the cynic has a need to reject things on emotional grounds, the 
&gt; Flake has a need to accept EVERYTHING on emotional grounds.  Any shadow, 
&gt; sound, or corner of the eye flash just HAS to be a ghost or spirit. ----or 
&gt; whatever.  I think you know the type, and   these &quot;flakes&quot; are what cynics 
&gt; accuse us who are serious about paranormal studies  of being.  Perhaps its 
&gt; one of the reasons they get us so angry.

&gt; I&#x27;ve heard the same said for the evp researchers!  But it&#x27;s not that 
&gt; simple in either case:
&gt; the last block that you reference has small print that says &quot;Compare the 
&gt; hypothesis to the experiment&#x27;s conclusion&quot;.  Which of course you can&#x27;t do 
&gt; unless you already visited the hypothesis block and have a hypothesis to 
&gt; which to compare.  That in turn has small print which says &quot;predict the 
&gt; outcome of the problem&quot;, which of course you can&#x27;t do either unless you&#x27;ve 
&gt; already visited the earlier block of Purpose (&quot;state the problem&quot;).
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s helpful to deny good evidence, whether it is good 
&gt; evidence from someone claiming to have detected spirits, or whether it is 
&gt; good evidence from someone claiming that people can mistake noise for 
&gt; speech or random radio tunings for spirit control.  That&#x27;s why the 
&gt; scientific method is valuable: it keeps both the skeptic and the believer 
&gt; real.
