Question:

I don't hear most of the files you post, but you hear them so=
 clearly. The only way to validate what you hear is true, would be to follo=
w up with something that you got that actually happened.

Have you ever hea=
rd a message that came true that nobody else heard, basically validating yo=
ur experience?
