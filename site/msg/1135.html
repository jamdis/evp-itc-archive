i think "necroradio" might put people off. i like the other one tho-poryphoradio
   
  i notice that the chance emanations from this thing make my fluoresvcent markers glo like an em panel.
   
  what is so useful is that , in my absence from spook-o-vision,  ordinary tech has advanced to where i can listen in real time--not near well enough to understand what their saying though.  nevertheless , you can tell a lot by the shape of the transmissions-mostly buoyant young adult types.  theres often chanting like monks and to-and-fro like cheerleaders at football game, peculiar group, "sing-talking".    lone mature male voices are usually in foreign accent . theres a lot of clues just in the envelope. im making tapes for evidence but they are pretty crappy so far.
   
  not the faintest trace of perfidy
