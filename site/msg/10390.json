I did it with my  brother&#39;s \nfatherinlaw 2 days after he died.  My technician helped me out  and went and \ngot this guy for me and I just about flipped when his voice  actually came over \nthe radio.  Unfortunately it did not record.  It  was only meant for my ears.\n \nJeff\n \n \nIn a message dated 4/23/2008 11:58:46 A.M.

I just had a death in my Family, and I \n&gt; was wandering if anybody  does a session today/or tonight if you could \n&gt; try to get in contact  with a Mr. Charlie Clarke,(my Great Uncle) or \n&gt; Mrs. Joann Clarke(his  wife has past a couple of months ago)to see if \n&gt; you can contact  them. If you do contact him can you tell him that \n&gt; Rees will be  asking to speak with them tonight around 7-8pm eastern \n&gt; time. To see  if they can contact me. They lived a long and \n&gt; wonderful life  together. So all my family is sad to see him go, but \n&gt; we know it was  his time to leave, and life goes on. He should be \n&gt; happy to be back  with his wife. (He was 83 years old) I know \n&gt; probaly somebody here  might think this is crazy, dumb or \n&gt; disrespectful, but that is my  business. I think it should be easy to \n&gt; get in contact with him  since he just crossed over. Please let me \n&gt; know if you tried and any  evidence you might get from him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt;  William  Rees\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n \n____________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
