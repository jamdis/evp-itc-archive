I fully agree with Bruce's comment about not l=
eaving a Box running without supplying input or asking questions. After I b=
uild each MiniBox, my original practice was to leave it running overnight a=
s a burn-in to insure that if there was an early failure, it would happen b=
efore the device was shipped. After a while I noticed the Boxes would begin=
 cursing or calling me by name repeatedly. By then I realized that anytime =
the Box is activated, entities will attempt to communicate within a minute =
or so. They seem to sense that a 'portal' is open so crowd around and try t=
o get the operators attention.I have since changed my procedures and have l=
imited my tests to power-up and then alignment, and indicate verbally to wh=
oever/whatever is present that this is a test and I am not trying to commun=
icate, but to just insure that the device is working properly before sendin=
g it to its new owner. The incidence of bad language has totally disappeare=
d and the Box is actually remarkably quiet during this process. As I final =
test I do a very short test so confirm that communications are being made, =
then thank the entity and sign off.As I have stressed repeatedly, this devi=
ce, whether a MiniBox, Frank's Box, RS Hack, Joe's Box, or whatever, it NOT=
 a toy and should be treated with respect. Until more is known, sessions sh=
ould be handled with care and documented properly. I am attempting to gathe=
r and rewrite my operations guidelines and welcome input from everyone. The=
se guidelines are device-independent. I want to insure that all persons who=
 read them are using the device properly and with the correct attitude.Ron =
