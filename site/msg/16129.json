But this little guy had lots of heart :) I could pick him up in the air with the little cat bottle I had. He was so determined to get his fill :) \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kristin&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; HI Jim.  I am sorry for your loss.  Our pets are the only family that really\n&gt; does give unconditional love.  But I wanted to drop a note to tell you I\n&gt; heard the &#39;roar/meow&#39; around the 8 sec mark and I heard it!  It very well\n&gt; could be a cat&#39;s meow.  Keep trying!\n&gt; \n&gt; k\n&gt;"}
