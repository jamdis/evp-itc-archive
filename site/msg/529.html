LOL well you thought it sounded too good that it was so cheap. 
   
  I wonder if perhaps you have some auto junk yards, wrecker towing salvage yards or something like that close by, they usually have a range of parts and pieces, so do car radio installation shops. They trash old radios all the time.

  It's worth lookin into.

I ordered the latest chips from Audio Labs of Georgia. http://www.audiolabga.com/  they were half the price of Mouser. The IF cans, and oscillator coils I order from Mouser. Guess there was a reason why the LM3820 was 12 cents each!? The new chips are $2.04 each. 
  
   For new comers, I use a system that generates a random varying DC voltage of 8 volts max. I use this voltage to randomly tune an AM radio. The random audio from the radio goes to an echo chamber, usually a small aluminum box via a speaker. A mic mounted in the box picks up the ghost voices, which are formed by the spirits using the bits of speech and music in the box. Of course there are always some broadcast fragments that get through, but these are fairly easy to spot, and rarely address me by name.  I have been using tuner modules removed form older digital car stereos, but these are getting harder to find. 
  
   I provide all information, and schematics for my system on my site, and curiously, I have not had a single person say the followed the instruction, and made the system, and yet I have many that will tell me how the system really works, or more often, how it does not work. http://franksumption.tripod.com/ 
  
   The schematics are vague when it comes the tuner, that�s because so far, every one has been different, so there�s no standard interface to the tuner.
