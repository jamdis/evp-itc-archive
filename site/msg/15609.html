<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>CORRECT...!!! Facto-Mundo... I have always had my opinion that &quot;no matter&quot; what anyone else states that they &quot;hear&quot; in there EVP&#x27;s....this will NOT influence me as to what I hear. It is either there or it is not.To &quot;matric&quot; is not an option :)  --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Fransen, Debbie&quot; &lt;debbie.fransen@...&gt; wrote:

&gt; I am sorry but I have to put my two cents in here.
&gt; The more you listen to EVP&#x27;s the more sensitive you become to what
&gt; spirit is saying, so it 
&gt; doesn&#x27;t matter if someone tells you or not, you know what you heard
&gt; whether it&#x27;s the same or not.
&gt; And the people who listen to Darkness radio surely know what EVP is, and
&gt; about the paranormal.
&gt; Most are not first time listeners, so how about we not make a big issue
&gt; this time about how
&gt; the audience could be manipulated because they said what the EVP&#x27;s were
&gt; supposed to be saying.
&gt; I don&#x27;t know why somebody always has to be critic. It is what it
&gt; is........
&gt; You either believe it or you don&#x27;t.........
&gt;  
&gt; Great interview Frank,,, It&#x27;s about time you came out of the
&gt; basement.... LOL

&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, the examples used were problematic.
&gt; 
&gt; You might notice they either played the EVP, then told the audience what
&gt; the they were supposed to hear, and then played it again. Or told the
&gt; audience what they were supposed to hear first. They never just played
&gt; the sound (without the leading questions), and gave the audience some
&gt; time to decide what it was saying on their own.
&gt; 
&gt; So while the history at the start was interesting, all the examples
&gt; were, sadly, more examples of how people can fool themselves with
&gt; pareidolia, than examples of spirit communications.
&gt; 
&gt; Note also, this also explains why prerecording noises, and using them
&gt; later for the source of a Q/A session, still works. It&#x27;s a tricky
&gt; explanation when trying to explain how spirits are &#x27;changing&#x27; the sounds
&gt; at session time. But it is an easy explanation that it wouldn&#x27;t matter
&gt; whether the sounds were live or recorded, if it was just people hearing
&gt; what they wanted to hear.
&gt; 
&gt; I realize that many people aren&#x27;t out to prove anything, and that&#x27;s
&gt; fine: but in this case, it seemed a point of the interview was to
&gt; demonstrate the efficacy of the box. In this case it would be better to
&gt; either state they do not expect their examples to be prove anything, or
&gt; if they expect to convince an audience, to use better testing of their
&gt; results, and less leading of the audience.
&gt; 
&gt; imho

&gt; &gt; I agree with Shane. That was a great talk Frank S and Bill M.! Ib&#x27;d
&gt; also like to thank Steve and Kristin for sharing some of your EVP
&gt; results with them to use on the show. Those were some good examples of
&gt; Frank&#x27;s box and the sweep tuning method. 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; I love it when people in this group work together towards our common
&gt; goal. It&#x27;s a wonderful example of teamwork and treating this research
&gt; (and each other) with honesty and dignity, instead of some of the
&gt; egotistical lies and deciet thats being spread around out there. It
&gt; helps maintain focus and a better perspective on this subject. Great job
&gt; everyone!
