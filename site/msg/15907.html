Those guys just like to prey on livestream chatters. Once they were taken o=
ut of that venue they lost their footing. People who have big egos usually =
are just hiding something about themselves. Rather than look in the mirror =
they prefer to distract your attention from the truth. Dig a bit deeper and=
 you may be surprised what lies beneath the facade.
=A0
The investigation w=
ent great and the clips from it have been posted. Jeff got a really good au=
dible evp response to one of his questions while he and Pam were down in th=
e basement that we all heard live. That was captured on the recording as wa=
s some of the light show they witnessed. There were also interesting respon=
ses on the=A0box and the puck. They also had quite a few personal encounter=
s we didnt get to see before the show began.
=A0
Another interesting thing =
I saw was Chris Flemings drawing of a dark man in a hat was=A0very much lik=
e Sumptions itc image on the homepage of this group. People in the chat wer=
e invited to participate and tell what they saw, heard or felt and aside fr=
om the foul mouth hackers, there were some very interesting correlations to=
 what some people who joined in late were seeing that related to things oth=
ers have witnessed there in the house or information being recieved thru th=
e devices being used. 
=A0
As for the negs I for one believe in karma and e=
ventually they will get back that which they dished out. They may not like =
the way it returns to them. Lies may come in the form of a wicked tongue bu=
t truth tends to be a double edge sword which can remove the head its attac=
hed to.
=A0
Theres supposed to be another live investigation soon I will le=
t you guys know when I have more details.
