I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s country wide, or if they&#39;ll ve replaced with something else. These two radios are the best I&#39;ve found for ghost boxes. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  So I&#39;m giving as many as I can the heads up so those interested can check on this disturbing development. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Windows Live: Life without walls.\n&gt; http://windowslive.com/explore?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_WL_allup_1a_explore_032009\n&gt;"}
