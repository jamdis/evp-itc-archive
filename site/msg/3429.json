IT INVOLVED SUCH RESEARCHERS AS MAGGY \nHERSHBACH AND HER HUSBAND THAT WHERE THE RECIPIENTS OF LONG LENGTHY \nMESSAGES IN ALL DIFFERENT FORMATS FROM THE SPIRIT WORLD THEY IN TURN \nWORKED WITH SUCH EVP PIONEERS AS HANS MUELLER, KONSTANTINE \nRAUDIVA,GEORGE MEEK AND MARK MACY TO NAME A FEW. THESE EARLY PIONEERS \nTHROUGH THE HERSHBACHS IN LUXEMBORG RECIEVED DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS ON \nHOW TO FURTHER COMMUNICATION THAT NOT ONLY LED TO OUR CURRENT EVP \nGATHERING TECHNIQUES BUT ALSO THE MOTHER OF ALL BOXES THE SPIRICOM.\nTHESE RESEARCHERS WERE TOLD THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIANT IN THE \nSTRENGTH AND FURTHERENCE OF SPIRIT COMMUNICATION WAS HARMONY AND PEACE \nAND GOOD INTENTIONS WITHIN THIS CIRCLE THEY HAD BEEN LED TO FORM.\n\nBUT SADLY AS HUMAN BEINGS USUALLY DO JELOUSY AND EGO BECAME A POISON TO \nTHE CIRCLE AND SOME INDIVIDUALS THAT WHERE ENVIOUS OF OTHERS SUPERIOR \nSUCESSES BROUGHT BAD VIBRATIONSS TO THE GROUP AND THE CIRCLE WAS BROKEN.\n\nIMMEDIATLY FOLLOWING THE ADVANCED COMMUNICATION THAT HAD BEEN ENJOYED \nFOR A NUMBER OF YEARS SLOWLY DWINDLED AWAY.\n\nNOW I BELIEVE WE ARE BEING GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS \nUNPRESIDENTED TASK AND BRIDGE THE GAP OF COMMUNICATION FULLY.\nAS OF LATE THERE HAS BEEN A FLOOD OF NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT SEEMS TO BE \nWORKING AS HOPED WE ARE IN OUR FETAL STAGES BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD WE \nWILL BE BROUGHT ALONG SLOWELY AND CAREFULLY.\n\nSO MY THOUGHTS ARE LETS KEEP THE GOOD VIBES AND HARMONY GOING AND BLOCK \nAS MUCH OF THE NEGATIVITY AS WE CAN AND ALL WORK TOGETHER TWORD THIS \nCOMMON GOAL. LETS NOT LET THE SINS OF OUR FATHER SO TO SPEAK AFFECT \nWHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH.\n\nBRUCE HALLIDAY"}
