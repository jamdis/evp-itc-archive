<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I know some of you are aware of the &quot;Seven&quot; who contacted the earlier 
ITC researchers, but for those who have not read this, here is an 
excerpt about it and the link to the complete article:

&quot;An early pioneer of ITC was George Meek, an American engineer who in 
the 1970s teamed with a medium, William O &#x27; Neill, to create a device 
called Spiricom, which enabled two-way conversations between the 
living and the dead.  In the 1980s, a Luxembourg couple, Maggy Harsch-
Fischbach and Jules Fischbach, began experimenting with 
electromagnetic tape.  They were contacted by ethereal beings who 
called themselves The Seven, part of a fraternity called the Rainbow 
People, who were interested in facilitating interdimensional 
communication.  The Seven work in Time Stream, a collaboration of 
nonhuman beings and the human dead willing to work with the human 
living to form a bridge across realities.  Key to the success of this 
communication, they said, is the consciousness and purity of motives 
of the living researchers. &quot;
