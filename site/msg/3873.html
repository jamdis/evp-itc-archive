&gt; Hi All;
&gt;  
&gt;  I feel like I&#x27;m getting pulled inmultiple directions, each wanting 
to validate, and endorse their version of the box, and/or the 
results. It&#x27;s nerve wracking, and making me nuts. I don&#x27;t know what 
is the correct use, function, or output of the box, I know only how I 
use it. I get what most others get, and more. What everyoe else does 
wiht it is up to them. The box is an ITC devcie, my orignal use was 
to use for my own communications. It seemed rel;ated to EVP, so i 
shared my results on various EVP web sites, and groups. I regret 
that, I  wish I would have kept it to myself. Humanity doesn&#x27;t even 
understand their own minds, and yet they want to comunicate with the 
higher realms. The other uses, such as spirit communcation, I tend to 
stay away from, it&#x27;s too unpredeictable, and you can&#x27;t tell who/what 
is talking. Personally I think 90% is your own minds talking back to 
you, and giving what is expected.  
&gt;  
&gt;  I&#x27;ve reached a point where I&#x27;ve had enough public interaction. 
Everyone wnat to beat up Moon, yet everyone wants to do the same 
friggin&#x27; things, and I&#x27;m stuck in the middle.  I don&#x27;t vcare about 
demons, bad guys, or saints coming through, I have my own group that 
comes through, and that&#x27;s what the box was made for.
