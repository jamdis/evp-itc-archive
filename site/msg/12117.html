<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>But, are there any files on this group where any of you believe you
are communicating with a spirit?  Frank&#x27;s box seems to really force
all kinds of &quot;voices&quot; out of the airwaves and I am not yet buying it.

Does any one have anything constructive to say to us in regard to
actual paranormal investigation via Frank&#x27;s box, rather than mildly
entertaining techno-tweaking? 

I was on a multi-group investigation at an old historical mission in
Santa Barbara a week ago, for instance and watched the frank&#x27;s box at
work for the first time.

Sure, I heard a few things that sounded obviously like radio, but we
did hear a very eerie woman&#x27;s voice screaming when we were in the main
chapel room, and THAT got my attention..  But everything else I have
heard so far in the files here is not striking me as the voice of any
apparition, due to the weakness of quality. 

If you&#x27;re still reading this, I have to tell you I have had striking
results in my own home, simply letting a recording device roll, and if
you&#x27;re not yet interested in hearing these samples, I guess you&#x27;re
more into the box than the afterlife and that&#x27;s YOU, not me! :)

LOVE,

Katherine.</pre>
