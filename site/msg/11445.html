<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Zack,

I was at the Lincoln Theater in October, and one of the Chicago
researchers got an amazing photograph of a Shadow Person in the main
seating area.  I took the Mini to the Mezzanine because I had seen an
apparition of a man in a dark suit there -- he kept walking up to me
and standing next to me, then vanishing.  But I did not hear anything
obvious via the box there.  The basement was the best.  There is a lot
going on in that theater.

&gt; I know some people who got a VIDEO of One-Armed Red a few years ago
in the 
&gt; basement. He walked across the room, plainly in view (well, you
could see 
&gt; the shape but no features).

&gt; &gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Recently I did an investigation at the Lincoln Theater in Decatur, IL
&gt; &gt; with my Mini-Box, and got some interesting clips from the basement
&gt; &gt; area.  The files are too large to be uploaded to the forum here, but a
&gt; &gt; short video with the audio clips has been posted on You Tube by Joey
&gt; &gt; Tito, a Chicago researcher who filmed the investigation.  The audio
&gt; &gt; clips are at the end, and Joey matched them to a transcript of what I
&gt; &gt; picked up.  I sent the clips to Frank, and he picked up even more.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The You Tube link is www.youtube.com/xflexx1  Joey has a short version
&gt; &gt; and a long version; pick the short one.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a report on the investigation posted on my blog on MySpace at
&gt; &gt; www.myspace.com/rosemaryellenguiley  and Joey&#x27;s video is on my home
&gt; &gt; page there as well.  The blog also has my report on a similar
&gt; &gt; investigation at Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield; the clips from
&gt; &gt; that are posted on this forum in my folder.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt; Rosemary
