&gt; Now that WAS amazing.  Clearly a pointed reply to your specific question.  Blew my socks off.

&gt; &gt; I asked a specific question about the latest box i&#x27;m building.  My  
&gt; &gt; question was simple and to the point &quot;Is it the board or the radio that&#x27;s  causing 
&gt; &gt; the problem?&quot;
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; The answer came seconds after asking it.  It was an intelligent  response 
&gt; &gt; to my question.  I would like for someone to comment of this with  the 
&gt; &gt; explanation of how they did that.  I just know they speak to me and i  don&#x27;t know 
&gt; &gt; how they do it.  There is still so much to learn about this  field.
