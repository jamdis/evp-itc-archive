<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just posted a new file on Esnips.  It&#x27;s fairly big in size so I went
ahead and put it on there to help save space on here.  This is the link:
http://www.esnips.com/doc/99a4a4b1-de10-40d8-943e-85b809a2332a/Session-4-01_30_08-20-125-govt

I did as Bruce had asked and just used the RS 20-125 with a digital
recorder and this is what I came up with.  It&#x27;s a little over 30
seconds long.  

Bruce, if you still want to hear all of this session, I will put it
all on Esnips.  Just let me know.  There is quite a bit more to it
than just this one clip.  It&#x27;s amazing all the things that came through.

Here&#x27;s a little background on the file.  I asked two questions.  The
first was, &quot;Is the US governemnt using ITC research?&quot;  The second,
&quot;How is the US goverment using ITC research?&quot;  I hear these things in
this order: &quot;Yeah it is, just stop it, just stop, you need help,&quot; and
something toward the end that I can&#x27;t quite make out.  Sounds like a
couple of words and then &quot;tells me to.&quot; Let me know what you think.
