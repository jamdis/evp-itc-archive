There is no doubt in my mind that it works, but it\nuses a very different technology. After questioning what it used, I\nfound that there it is meant to take the frequency of an organ,\nconsider it on an axis and flip it, play that frequency and much like\ndestructive waves, it cancels out bacterias and the such. Even the\nversion I was reading was a significantly simplified version, this is\neven moreso, but I found it quite interesting.\nYou can find most of the demos at: \nhttp://69.89.31.222/~thesoun6/soundimages/\n\nGood luck, I hope we can all improve our minds and bodies with the new\ntechnologies available\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been looking around the website:  \n&gt; http://69.89.31.222/~thesoun6/?page_id=26\n&gt; \n&gt; And I&#39;ve joined the group.  The sounds are really different from what\n&gt; I&#39;m used to.  I *really* like Monroe&#39;s Gateway hemisync CD&#39;s.  It\n&gt; seems the main difference is most of the sounds Donald Adams developed\n&gt; are more for the body, rather than the brain.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are some samples for download.  I haven&#39;t had a chance to work\n&gt; with them yet, but I&#39;m really fascinated by the concept.  It makes\n&gt; perfect sense to me.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a little familiar with Reiki.  My main training is in a form of\n&gt; energy work called Quantum Touch. And I took a weekend Pranic Healing\n&gt; workshop which I enjoyed.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Recently there was a study done to see if one of Monroe&#39;s cd&#39;s\n&gt; (created only for the study, not for market) would improve the\n&gt; reception of EVP.  To clarify, the sounds where played through\n&gt; headphones into the receiver&#39;s ear while conducting an EVP session. \n&gt; They were not used as background ... though come to think of it, that\n&gt; might be an interest experiment in itself.  As I recall, there was not\n&gt; a significant change, one way or the other, when the sounds where\n&gt; listened to during recording.  But I was glad to see such research\n&gt; taking place.  All data is helpful, in my opinion.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;gamedazed&quot; &lt;gamedazed@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d be more than willing to participate. i&#39;ve been using binaurals for\n&gt; &gt; years (sounds similar if not the same technology). Ironically enough I\n&gt; &gt; also dabbled in Reiki :p I&#39;d still be considered lvl1 though. I have\n&gt; &gt; seen the images which are supposed to enhance abilities and while I\n&gt; &gt; notice power, I can&#39;t utilize it. Anyways, I&#39;d be very happy to join\n&gt; &gt; you in this, especially if its frequency is this beneficial.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Very cool YouTube video. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sonpvUxGL8 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The patterns reminded me of Emoto&#39;s work with water, but this is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sound.  Really interesting.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My hearing is very sensitive, so I don&#39;t know how much of, or\nfor how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; long, the sounds I heard that I would be able to tolerate.  But I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; going to go browse a little more or your web site.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Margaret  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Doc Stars &lt;docstarsrx008@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to introduce myself.. and share this information with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; group here in the hopes that some members may have an interest in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; participating in an experimental research project.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Im looking for people who are willing to participate in our online\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiment and can provide input, feedback and comparison on some of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the various digital frequency files we are using.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After many years of researching, on going development and testing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our current experimental group of approximately 2000 volunteers have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been witness to some really unusual and intense phenomena playing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out... bordering on the supra-normal. We&#39;re seeing rapid, profound\n&gt; &gt; &gt; effects on the body and mind occuring via this new acoustic\nfrequency\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tool.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Specifically, one of the areas we are focusing on now and are\nhoping\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to collect more data on are the effects on the mind and body\nfrom the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; use of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; frequencies designed to entrain the body and mind towards those\n&gt; &gt; &gt; states conducive to the experience of ascension and the\nmanifestation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of desired positive change.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I recently released new &#39;frequency&#39; protoypes that our group has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been testing and their reports of the results they have been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiencing have been staggering.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Implications currently, are for enormous  potential\nimprovements for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; health and wellness as well as rapid change from challenging\nmind and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; emotional states to ones of increased vitality, increased\nperformance\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and increased well being and balance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One possible and very real application of this may be to address\n&gt; &gt; &gt; both general and specific aspects of health issues.  For example one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of our members experimented with effects on the blood , had an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; independent lab analyze his blood sample and it seems like there\nwas a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dramatic change in the bloods terrain!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Data collected to date on reaction responses have been over\nthe top\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; favourable.....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are finding that actual &#39;things&#39; are happening, when these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; frequencies are simply played. Very noticeable and dramatic effects\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and changes in the body, mind and environment - unlike anything\n&gt; &gt; &gt; induced by any other sound (that we know of).  many people who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experimented on these frequencies report that they are unlike other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; existing technologies such as binaural beats.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What we need right now however, are more volunteers who are\nwilling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to test out our other frequencies and keep a log of their\nfindings and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; report their observations to our group. There is no cost\nrequired for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; testing frequencies, the primary benefit to my group and I is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; collection of data.... the benefit to you, well... once you see what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we are engaged in, I think you will be more than satisfied with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experience.....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Two things important here, one is to share with you the\nobservations\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; group in their process of discovery in relation to the health\n&gt; &gt; &gt; related frequency track - the thought being, that you are likely to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not only find this intrinsically interesting and newsworthy but also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inspiring. The second is to provide you with a means of facilitating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your own journey through this phenomena in the hopes you can share\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your own unique findings with us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Feel free to view a recent post on our research forum that details\n&gt; &gt; &gt; how to access this information and also various frequency tracks you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can download.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\nhttp://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/the_sound_of_stars/message/8216\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Examples of recent reports by users ;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; “I am struck with the effects that sound has on the physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; structure. That is, especially in the subtle tissues like\nneurons and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; synapses. Case in point, I don&#39;t hesitate in expressing myself just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the way it comes out. No coloring, no bravado, no bullshit....the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; endorphine level in the body went way up. I have noted from my\ninitial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; listening of this freq. is that it appears to synchronize the 2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hemispheres of the brain and thought became markedly coherent. ..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps the feeling of increased endorphine flow could be an actual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; increase in neuro- transmitter presence, particularly\nseratonin.... As\n&gt; &gt; &gt; things ended I was left with this feeling of balance and well\nbeing. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; definitely want to work with this sequence more. It seems to be the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; right one for me currently. I probably want to post this explanation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the Yahoo site. I&#39;ll be sending my initial impressions in another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; email to you shortly. Thanks again for this amazing opportunity.”\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; “This morning I listened to kindle mind set, I have had\nfamily in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and had not used the fequencies for a week. The first sensations\nwere\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an extreme energy from my hands I am a Reiki Master but the\nenergy and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; heat I felt was more than I had experienced before.There was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bubbling feeling inside my chest their was intense tingling of my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chest and torso, a sensual, sexual feel.My arms legs and feet were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extremely warm, I am usually cold. It felt like my blood was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bubbling.I had an effervesce feeling in my mouth. My feet\ntingled and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as I nwas laying on the chaise listening, I closed my eyes and was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enjoying a full color animated video like p roduction without sound.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is first time I have seen anything other than a magenta colored\n&gt; &gt; &gt; flower.I listened to kindle set for about 3 hours. I have Bose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speakers on the computer I used this morning.”\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
