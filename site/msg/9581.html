<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>So here&#x27;s my run-down of responses for the past week ;-):

Frank S: Congrats on franken out the 469 to your liking!

I did hear most of everyone&#x27;s files posted:  Urkle and Bruce&#x27;s wer
most clear.

KATHYWEIR:  Audacity is free - google it.

NATHAN:  Whatever you believe is okay.  Opinions make the world go
round.  If you are open and want to learn more than welcome.

JULI - WHATS UP GIRL!!!  I have been hanging upside down - out my
window and about to throw up a ladder and sit on my roof to get better
reception!!!  I have run out of tinfoil... can you spare some?

AL from o&#x27;BAMA:  I too always get contradicting answers.  Just
yesterday I was cleaning my pool and listening to my 470 and I heard
them say &quot;SHE&#x27;S USING US FOR ENTERTAINMENT&quot;  I replied that I was
trying to get experience &#x27;hearing&#x27;.  I heard THAT&#x27;S GOOD&quot; and I also
heard &quot;BITCH LEAVE&quot;.  I apologized if they felt I was intruding and
asked if they wanted me to shut down or just the DH&#x27;s wanted me too. 
I heard &quot;BOTH&quot; and I heard &quot;NO DON&#x27;T&quot;.  Who do I choose to listen to?
 I stayed on for a bit longer - I always err on the side of positive.
 If I&#x27;m looking for answers to important personal stuff.. I wouldn&#x27;t
ask the box for answers.  PS:  I once asked if they could read my mind
and they responded with &quot;OF COURSE NOT&quot; and then proceeded to answer
my next question before I asked!  Go figure :-)

RHONDA - Are you hearing voice girl???  I knew it!  You&#x27;re as crazy as
me!!!  LOL...  I think that&#x27;s cool.

REES:  I really do believe your lost session was very cool.  I don&#x27;t
believe it&#x27;s loss was a coincidence.  

BRUCE:  Cool pictures in the Photos Section.  Have you ever thought
about doing a BOX session and a Photo session at the same time and see
if you could get a photograph of the person talking??  That would be
an interesting experiement.

MARGARET:  Your knowledge is so emense!  I am grateful you are here
with us to share.  

ANNETTE:  Congrats on your son&#x27;s wedding!

JOEL:  The news item you posted is disturbing on so many levels.  I
just pray that the universe works it out so that karma is indeed
something that these people will have to deal with.  Nothing is sacred
anymore it seems...

AARON:  C O N G R A T U L A T I O N S !!  On your first successful
session.  You&#x27;re hooked and welcome aboard the crazy train ;-)

VINNIE:  CONGRATS TO YOU TOO!  Do you want us to call your Dave or
Vinnie?  

RON L:  I asked about Austism for you and I heard :&quot;MAN MADE&quot; and when
I asked about vaacines I heard &quot;YES..&quot;  I will work on trying to get
these files online.  But I have so much to go through...  I think I
will be listening for about a week...  

whew... i missed you all..
