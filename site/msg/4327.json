I can&#39;t get the AM oscillator to run very well \nabove 4 MHZ, I&#39;ve had that problem on all the Japanese chips. \nSo...today I started yet another proto type board using the old \nLM3820 AM only chip. I&#39;ve had those up to 20mhz easy, I didn&#39;t use \nthem in any boxes though because they don&#39;t have a built in detector, \nand they were AM only. I have over 70 of the LM3820&#39;s that I paid 12 \ncents each for. \n\n Frank-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Frank,\n&gt; \n&gt; What chip are you using?\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun, 16 Dec 2007, Frank Sumption wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t get this chip to run above about 4MHZ, higher than that \nand\n&gt; &gt; the oscillator signal drops rapidly to unusable levels, so I gave \nup on\n&gt; &gt; the idea--for now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
