(This error bar is rather large because the energy is measured as the difference of two, much larger, numbers.) Indeed, this excitation energy is so low that it is less than the ionization energy of thorium. Moreover, the 3.5 eV isomer of thorium-229 has a half-life of 45 hours and is conveniently produced in the alpha decay of uranium-233.   During the last couple of years, the race has been on to detect the ultraviolet photons, termed &quot;gamma-rays&quot; on account of their nuclear origin, that would signal the de-excitation of the 3.5 eV isomer. Indeed, two groups reported recently that they had observed this process. However, the latest results suggest that the signal was actually due to\n alpha-particle-induced fluorescence of nitrogen in the air surrounding the samples (S B Utter et al . 1999 Phys. Rev. Lett . 82 505; R W Shaw et al. 1999 Phys. Rev. Lett . 82 1109). It is not possible to dispense with the alpha particles, unfortunately, because they come from the uranium-233 decays that are used to produce the thorium-229 isomer in the first place.\n  \n        \n    However, all is not yet lost. Robert Shaw and co-workers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee have made a detailed comparison of the ultraviolet spectrum from uranium-233 in air with the corresponding emissions from a nitrogen discharge (see right). The strongest transitions in both samples are very similar, but there is an additional transition from uranium-233 in air, at 391 nm (3.2 eV), that remains unexplained. Shaw and colleagues are cautious, saying that &quot;it could be the thorium-229 ultraviolet gamma-ray&quot;, but adding that there are &quot;other candidates for its identity&quot;.\n  Although not discussed by the Oak Ridge group, it is evident that if the 391 nm transition can be identified with the spontaneous decay of the 45-hour thorium-229 isomer, then the reverse process could be attempted: that is it should be possible to excite the nucleus from its ground state into the isomer with a 391 nm laser beam. And if nuclei can be &quot;tickled&quot; with a laser beam, then it might be possible to harness the huge energy density of highly excited isomers.   So, who will have the last laugh? The thorium-229 story is far from over, and the hafnium-178 story has only just begun. In both cases the isomers serve as &quot;laboratories&quot; for exploring the interactions of low-energy photons with atomic nuclei. Taken in combination with the new laser-fusion results it is apparent that the impact of light on nuclei has a bright future.    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1575743981-1175965942=:40077\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;my reason for putting this on evp-itc is to remind that your&nbsp;endeavors can have a practical side, too.&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;in the last 2 days of recent, big opening i just tuned randomly till &quot;they&quot; called out my name--usually loud enough for my wife/witness to hear it accross the room and jump out of her skin.&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;they only SAY they are in the future; almost always, its a trick.&nbsp; so far, it checks out this time.&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV class=clearfix id=message style=&quot;VISIBILITY: visible; OVERFLOW: hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- type = text --&gt;  &lt;SCRIPT defer type=text/javascript&gt; YAHOO.Shortcuts.hasSensitiveText = true; YAHOO.Shortcuts.doUlt = false; YAHOO.Shortcuts.location = &quot;us&quot;; YAHOO.Shortcuts.lang = &quot;us&quot;; YAHOO.Shortcuts.document_id = 32; YAHOO.Shortcuts.document_type = &quot;&quot;; YAHOO.Shortcuts.document_title = &quot;&quot;; YAHOO.Shortcuts.document_publish_date = &quot;&quot;;\n YAHOO.Shortcuts.document_author = &quot;&quot;; YAHOO.Shortcuts.annotationSet = { lw_1175965013_0: { text: &#39;http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/12/5/3&#39;, startchar: 111, endchar: 153, start: 111, end: 153, weight: 1, type: [&#39;shortcuts:/us/instance/identifier/hyperlink/http&#39;] , metaData: { linkHref: &quot;http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/12/5/3&quot;, linkProtocol: &quot;http&quot;, linkRel: &quot;nofollow&quot;, linkTarget: &quot;_blank&quot; } } };  YAHOO.Shortcuts.overlaySpaceId = &quot;97546169&quot;;  YAHOO.Shortcuts.hostSpaceId = &quot;97546168&quot;; &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;    &lt;DIV id=yiv229579440&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/12/5/3&quot; target=_blank rel=nofollow&gt;&lt;SPAN id=lw_1175965013_0 style=&quot;BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT color=#003399&gt;http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/12/5/3&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#003399&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;much mining and earth moving, drilling has gone on in the US from 2050 to 2100.&nbsp; i didnt find out why. except its related to&nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt; \n &lt;DIV&gt;a-&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;telluric currents/ferroglutinous transformations&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; &lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;b-&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;a layer of the mantle 40 miles deep is 1000 degrees C hotter than previously thought.&nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;the nerds engage in a sport.&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;they pile into a cylindrical vehicle that makes little noise and can drive trhough the ground or on it,.&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;it is powered by a&quot; thorium brick&quot; that rests in a side compartment.&nbsp; when in use, the side compartment emits intense ultraviolet light&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- toctype = X-unknown --&gt;&lt;!-- toctype = text --&gt;&lt;!-- text --&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;SCRIPT&gt; var callCount = ((oBw.agt.match( /gecko/ ) == &quot;gecko&quot;))?
