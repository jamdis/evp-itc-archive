<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It does look to me like others are misunderstanding what Rasterer is saying.
This is a big problem with e-mail. I&#x27;ve never seen him state that the boxes
don&#x27;t work.

I think it&#x27;s rather admirable if someone has seen no evidence of themselves
over a considerable amount of time, yet keeps looking. Is that the case
here?

After a while, most people start to get discouraged. I have been in places
where others recorded EVP sessions and got some EVP, and my recorder a mere
inches away didn&#x27;t get anything. Then there are times when I get dozens of
them and others get nothing. As I just noted in a previous post, there&#x27;s an
awful lot we don&#x27;t know here. My suspicion based on the above is that
whatever is producing the EVP can be highly selective. But I don&#x27;t know that
for sure.

&gt;
&gt; Well well...there it is! you have not had any luck on the box so right away
&gt; it doesn&#x27;t work. Or there has to be a some foul play involved. If I could
&gt; suggest you find someone who does has had many session with the box and sit
&gt; in. But I&#x27;m sure you would find some excuse why it saying whats its
&gt; saying...what&#x27; s your take on it wait don&#x27;t tell me...cb radio lol

&gt;   You asked several questions, so I&#x27;ll take them one at a time:
&gt;
&gt; 1) you hope what? that i made a fool out of myself or that i called it in
&gt; or perhaps both?
&gt;
&gt; I hope you called it in. Your resistance to giving the police information
&gt; you said you thought you had on a child abductor, even after several
&gt; prompts, makes me hope you did call it in, and didn&#x27;t just say that to stop
&gt; me from prompting you. I don&#x27;t know of course, I am not there. I have no
&gt; desire that you make a fool of yourself, but if it helps save a child from
&gt; am abductor, I think it would be worth it.
&gt;
&gt; 2) Why don&#x27;t you get on the box, and do some asking?
&gt;
&gt; As I have said in the past, my experience with those boxes has shown me
&gt; nothing paranormal yet.  However, people continue to say there is more to it
&gt; than my experience.  And so, I am keeping an open mind and trying to examine
&gt; the evidence you provide.
&gt;
&gt; 3) Why are negative people on these lists anyway. if you guys don&#x27;t believe
&gt; in this type of technology, why the heck are you all here?
&gt;
&gt; If I had absolulely no belief that there might be something interesting
&gt; going on with the technology, I would not have been so insistent that you
&gt; give your information to the police.  How could a person, of good
&gt; conscience, not prompt you to give that information to the police?  Again
&gt; how is that a negative thing to do?
&gt;
&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t the really negative thing be to ignore it?

&gt; i could just call them, and say i heard it from a psychic or something, at
&gt; least it would give them a hint, spirit said that the guy was hanging around
&gt; the camp grounds during the day, and left, then came back, i have no idea
&gt; how he would get that little boy out of a tent, with the whole sleeping
&gt; family in it with him, i think spirit said, he got him out, then took him
&gt; away, but from what i am hearing, and i could be wrong, very wrong, i really
&gt; hope i am wrong.  The man is a pedophile is what they said, from what the
&gt; tech said, they will catch him soon.  &quot;They will pick him up.&quot;
&gt; One group of spirit said, they know who he is, well, what should i do? sf

&gt;    When you label the files with what you heard, you influence the
&gt; listener to try to hear what you heard, rather than what they hear with no
&gt; hints.  So if you want to know what people really hear without your hints,
&gt; you need to send them out unlabeled.

&gt; If there is a chance you might be able to stop this Morgan person from
&gt; hurting another child, you must call now.   Waiting so that you don&#x27;t look
&gt; wrong or silly is not the priority here: there are more important things on
&gt; the line than personal ego (I hope).

&gt;  No, and no, this is a younger child, recently missing, I have not called
