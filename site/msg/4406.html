<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Perhaps those on the other side are more urgent, anxious and excited 
about the box breakthroughs than even we are.  Could it be because 
they see a bigger picture coming to pass?

&gt; Hi Ursula,
&gt; 
&gt; There is a certain urgency to Box messages - sort of like they need 
&gt; to convey quickly. The same thing happens in video ITC, it&#x27;s like 
&gt; there is but a moment and we all better pay attention. -Bill

&gt; &gt; Willy, Really interested in listening to the new files.  I&#x27;ll let 
&gt; you know after.
&gt; &gt;   Just to throw in regarding EVP maker and everything else but 
the 
&gt; boxes.  I used EVP maker and the water method AND foreign language 
&gt; broadcast method and radio static and box fan, etc etc etc before I 
&gt; got my shack hack and my Joe&#x27;s box, and I must admit that I have 
put 
&gt; everything else aside even though I got good results with ALL of 
&gt; those other methods.  There&#x27;s just something very exciting about 
the 
&gt; boxes, I think, that makes us forsake all others.  When I started 
&gt; using a hack, which Jeff Rezman made for me before I got the Joe&#x27;s 
&gt; Box, I felt it was a nervous sort of experimentation--that is to 
say, 
&gt; the loud, short, fast sound clips had me on edge, as I was used to 
&gt; quiet static and water, but I think now I&#x27;m addicted to the sound 
and 
&gt; the frenzy of it!  Does anyone else feel this way?

&gt; &gt;           Ursula and Misty  thank you very much for your 
feedback. 
&gt; I 
&gt; &gt; really appreciate you taking the time to listen, and for the 
&gt; &gt; comments, especially noting the dual layers of speech. 
Interesting. 
&gt; &gt; Frank S. - Thanks for the recent files from EVPmaker - nice! 
&gt; &gt; There hasn&#x27;t been much discussion regarding EVPmaker lately, so I 
&gt; &gt; wasn&#x27;t&#x27; sure if it was a viable tool to use. I haven&#x27;t read many 
&gt; &gt; older posts, but hope to get caught up during the holidays. Have 
&gt; you 
&gt; &gt; or others considered modifying speech synthesis software to 
&gt; generate 
&gt; &gt; random sounds? I wonder how something like that would work
&gt; &gt; On the 16th I did three 3minute recordings and got 9 clips from 
&gt; &gt; them. In this session, I was asking questions regarding a 
knocking 
&gt; &gt; sound I heard while going to sleep or waking up about 12 years 
ago. 
&gt; &gt; My life situation wasn&#x27;t the best at that time. It was always 
three 
&gt; &gt; knocks, and once a doorbell, but not the doorbell for where I was 
&gt; &gt; then living. Started the Knocking session by telling &quot;Rick&quot; that 
I 
&gt; &gt; got messages from previous session, got &quot;Well, he&#x27;s got 
patience!&quot; 
&gt; &gt; for response. Then was told, &quot;Aye, it smells in here.&quot; Next asked 
&gt; &gt; them what sound did I hear back then, and got &quot;it was knocking 
&gt; (maybe 
&gt; &gt; nothing?)&quot; The best one so far is; &quot;Our earthbound forefathers 
are 
&gt; &gt; video programs.&quot; A second voice keeps repeating &quot;Ent&quot; syllable 
&gt; &gt; during this one. I have put these files in a new folder called 
&gt; &gt; Knocking, which is under Laptop MP3s. More comments there. 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m making progress on getting the software needed to do 
&gt; &gt; linear scanning with the Radio Shark 2 USB am/fm radio and hope 
to 
&gt; &gt; have it up and running within the next week or two. 
&gt; &gt; Thanks again to all
&gt; &gt; Willy
