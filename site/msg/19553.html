=C2=A0The application for EVP staggers the ima=
gination. I was just reading on Above Top Secret where they think aliens ar=
e embedding images in sound, more likely it's spirits/etherics as well as E=
T. Now this is brings ITC into the 21st century!

=C2=A0A guy did a p=
ost on my FB page about this, he records using the RT-EVP and converts it t=
