Evidence that his EVP was a True EVP. Evidence that he indeed captured some=

    Interesting topic=
!

    BTW that investigation was at the former Manteno State Mental Hospit=
al. It included the amazing "It's Harold Wing" EVP I got. None of the peopl=
e doing the investigation there had ever heard of Harold Wing. Upon later e=
xamination of old records, it was found that Harold Wing was actually a pat=
ient who died there of typhoid fever in 1938. But we didn't find that out u=
ntil weeks later.

    How do you explain that conventionally?

        There's another possi=

 to get mostly all the same EVP on my DVR, which was hanging from my belt, =
and my camcorder, which was in front of my face. Other people on the invest=

 Hi, 
                  I believe I saw an explaination on this list about =
why if you have 2 recorders sitting side by side, why may one capture an EV=
P on one and not the other? Someone was explaining about an energy field li=

                  I'm trying to explain this theory to a frie=

                  Thanks Laura
