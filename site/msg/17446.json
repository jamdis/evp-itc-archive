Curiously, to make\nthem stop harrassing me, I just erase them from the tape and they seem to\nnot bother me in future recordings. Part of it was that if I had something\nthat seem to really help the communication I would get these darkheads.\n\n I don&#39;t get the hevan stuff, or rarely get any of that. I get suggestive\ncommunications, like I used to get my mother in-law until on time the said\n&quot;Joanne got a new body and moved up two steps&quot;.\n\n F-S\n\nOn Wed, Jun 2, 2010 at 11:11 AM, &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Some groups of spirit and demon groups, in the lower realms were getting a\n&gt; bit out of hand, those that won&#39;t get in line or are pushing and shoving\n&gt; other&#39;s, or trying to get them to back out I guess, &quot;dark heads&quot; are not\n&gt; happy about all those people leaving the darkness going into the light,\n&gt; because if they don&#39;t &quot;repent&quot; they will be left in total darkness for a\n&gt; thousand earth years, and &quot;the door is going to be shut tight.&quot; and they\n&gt; will only have the company of each other in total blackness, void of light,\n&gt; like an outer darkness, so, they are trying to slow things down.   I guess,\n&gt; so want us to play music to calm things down, and probably didn&#39;t want the\n&gt; negative energy heard, they were cussing, hissing and stuff like that, I do\n&gt; have it recorded to for those who doubt.  So, whomever it was asked me to\n&gt; play some music.  I don&#39;t think it is good to pass that negative stuff\n&gt; around, there is enough of that on these lists already.  But, it was good to\n&gt; prove a point about the FCC rules for Code of Conduct for radio stations,\n&gt; that both Bruce, Steve, and other&#39;s have already mentioned. sf\n&gt;\n&gt;  In a message dated 6/2/2010 12:42:44 P.M.
