I think Frank just realized he needed to take a step back from the fighting. They ALLLLL know it went to far and that by sending replys to bad emails it didnt accomplish anything but make each side angrier. \n   \n  Delete button my friends...its an awesome thing I tell ya!!! It takes two people for an email fight so just dont be one of the two.\n   \n  We have a better purpose than this drama. Better things to do with our time. For those who have nothing better to do with your time, I can email you a list of ideas, some even have to do with doing EVP or video ITC.\n   \n  As for evp, any member can post them but with all the crap flying who wanted to get involved??? They dont want to choose a side in a fight that had nothing to do with them. Frank may have felt the need to unjoin from this group but he is ALWAYS welcome to rejoin in the future. Everyone is. \n   \n  Maybe he felt if he unjoined it would take the pressure off other members here and make them more comfortable to post about ITC without having to get blasted for being a part of &quot;his&quot; group. He never wanted it to be &quot;his&quot; thats why he immediately made other owners.  It&#39;s not my group or your group it is &quot;everyones&quot; group. \n   \n  Every member here is equal. I may not agree with you all off the time but I am not here to agree or disagree with you. I am here to share ideas in a free forum alongside other researchers or people generally interested in educating themselves.\n   \n   I&#39;m telling you all, stop the BS, end the drama, find something better to do than talk behind each others backs or spar in nasty emails.
