At that point i will cut out \nthe 14 seconds of nothing and just leave the answer to my question.  \nSometimes i have to make the file a bit louder, but no mods to the \nactual file.  It is what it is and i leave it in raw format for all to \nhear, the less you mess with the files is better to bring people onto \nthis side of the fence.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rebecca&quot; &lt;rak4dds@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello All -\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been studying this format of communication for better part of \na \n&gt; year now.  I have been listening to clips and reading posts here for \n&gt; sometime and am impressed with direction of your work.  The majority \nof \n&gt; clips I&#39;ve listened to, regardless of the type of box used, are quite \n&gt; clear.  My question to you is as follows:  are the files edited or \n&gt; changed at all or is this the quality they are coming through at?  \n&gt; \n&gt; - Rak\n&gt;"}
