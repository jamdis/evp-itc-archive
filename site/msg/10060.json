You are the reason I come to this \nsite I wanted to learn more about the Franks box and how it works. I \nstill find it so mind boggling that you were about to come up with a \nbox to communicate with the dead. I have only recorded a few session \nand have already got the message I_see_princess at least the spirits \nall now who started the box research!\n\nNewbie Kay\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Please don&#39;t give up.  I am still learning, and I need a teacher.  \nEven though we don&#39;t know each other.  I try to learn something \neverday from you, so I will be able to make my own box one day.   \nEven if is a frankinized 12-469, or made from a car stereo.
