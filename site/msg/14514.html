What really sucks is he drags Frank's reputation into his scheme. If you ca=
n, I would contact any bidders he has and let them know.

r sorta Frank's Box?





  Been following this unprofessional idiot's item=
s for awhile now. I love how he says that Frank charges thousands of dollar=
s for an original Frank's box. 

  This dude is the worst type of con, prey=
ing on people who know only enough to be familiar with the term Frank's box=
. Then again, it always has bothered me when people take shack hacks and ch=
arge stupid prices for them on ebay under the Frank's box moniker.

  This =
guy is based out of Nevada I believe, and his group's ethics leave little t=
o be desired. Takes all kinds, I reckon...
