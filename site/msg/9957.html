For those of you who are paranormal investigators alike, you know the first rule of thumb is NEVER edit your clips!  If you want to be taken serious in this field and not under a microscope with the question of whether or not you in fact did actually get a voice and/or response and that clip is edited, don't bother putting it up for public display.  You can amplify it, take out the hiss, but you better not splice it in any way, cause your just asking for trouble.  
   
  I had this very debate with Bruce long ago.  I know first hand that if in fact its edited many question your motives behind why you in fact would bother removing the dead airtime between.  The very first thing that came into question when editing EVP from Frank's Box many moons ago (pun intended) that a certain person was in fact splicing his audio by putting the questions and response right after.  Many now consider him to be a fraud and this was just one of the reason built upon others as a direct result.  You are altering the clip, no ifs and or butts about.  It can therefore hurt your creditability as a researcher in the paranormal field.  Regardless with you save your original clips.  Everything you do comes into question.  You can clearly tell by the skip in rhythm as you play the audio vs the free flowing of the dial when it has been altered.  Real Time is real time people, not 15 seconds after the fact.  If you have to questions what you got...."If in Doubt, throw
 It Out".
   
  People, there is one thing that you have to remember.  The word of box research is spreading, and there are those who are implementing it as an additional tool on investigations.  This is not just some who are going to give up their current status as a ghost hunter to now slowly be a box researcher ( for that was never a thought for me).  I was hoping that through my research I could in fact incorporate it on my investigations.  Because of the radio fragments itself, there are many that do not support this research and believe we are reaching and grasping at nothing, and literally laugh when the subject of box research comes up.  Do you really want to give them an extra ammunition as splicing your clips?  I know myself that there is more that meets the eye in this line for communication, and I do stand proud and true of pursuing real time communication, myself, but cutting out the dead air is not just because you don't want to listen to it, or you can't fit it all is a
 lame excuse.  Use a different program!
   
  I personally have questioned many on their clips and have to tell you that if you truly want to be considered as a professional paranormal investigator/researcher that if you intend to use this protocol for you evp/box research clips, you stand to loose your creditability and the word fraud may just come into question.
   
  However, if you have nothing to loose as far as your reputation and or not in it to prove anything to anyone, be my guest.  There are many here that are not involved in the paranormal field and a prefer evp-itc researcher vs. other areas of the super natural.  If they are not putting themselves out there for God and Country to see, and are only doing it for your personal results and curiosity, and can could careless with others thing, then clip away to your hearts content!  
   
  Just remember, if someone who is currently studying evp and not box research sees and hears your clips, don't be surprised, if they start questioning your motives and box research all together!
   
  Just adding my 2 cents!
  Juli

        Hi Ron. There's plenty of room for long clips if people would change their software 
settings, as well as post in MP3 format rather than WAV. 

Hi LK. I would add, 'disclose when you have edited', so others aren't mislead by your 
results.
