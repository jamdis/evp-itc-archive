smiles, Is is just me or do you not feel as though your have a good relationship with them, almost as friends.  I know that when I always start I say good morning or good afternoon.  Always thank them and also compliment them for their assistance.  
   
  I seem to get more pleasure speaking with them then some of my friends that have a pulse, lol!
   
  Thanks for the imput!

          Hi Juli,
It's a funny thing, I received that comment during a session 
the day after my wife and mother in law spent 5 hours cleaning the junk out of my
daughters room and rearranging her furniture.
 
my technicians and I will try to always exchange a few pleasantries before getting down to
business.
