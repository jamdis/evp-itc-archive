Sometimes &quot;they&quot; will use the foreign language as the \nraw audio and make messages mixed in with it. \n\n Frank-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Michael Edwards &lt;f1cracker75@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks.  So it is shortwave am/fm, and you need to be able to sweep. \nI have an old panasonic shortwave am/fm radio that was my dad&#39;s. It \nstill works and it has the manual sweep with the dial. I wonder if that \nwould work.  Have any of you tried one of these.
