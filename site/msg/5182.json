If anyone has any questions for any of us, please \ne-mail us privately and let us know.  If we can try and answer some \nquestions that only you would know the answer to it would add an \nenormous amount of validity to this research.  I do believe that some \nof us have great communication and may be able to get some answers to \nthe questions asked.  If not, it&#39;s still another practice session \nthat can benefit us.  I know Bruce and i both have had questions \nanswered that we did not know the answer to ourselves from other \npeople involved.  This could be a project to consider.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey guy&#39;s \n&gt; \n&gt; The unlabeled files experiment was a resounding flop!\n&gt; \n&gt; Only a hand full of members responded with what they did or did not \n&gt; hear.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is how I heard them\n&gt; #4_There are three circles\n&gt; \n&gt; #8_David&#39;s just their guard\n&gt; \n&gt; The percentage of people that responded that they heard what I had \nheard\n&gt; was about 40% the individuals that heard some of what I heard but \nnot \n&gt; all was about 30% with the remaining 30% hearing something \ncompletely \n&gt; different.\n&gt; \n&gt; This type of experiment needs to be done on a regular basis with a \n&gt; substantial ammount of participents, otherwise the averages can not \nbe \n&gt; calculated and a general theory formed that is acceptable to most \n&gt; researchers in this field.\n&gt; \n&gt; If there is anyone else that would like to have a go at it I will \nbe \n&gt; glad to participate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;"}
