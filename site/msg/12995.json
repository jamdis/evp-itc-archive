Pretty interesting story!  First off, I am happy that you \nfound \n&gt; this forum.  There are a few things you should know right away that \n&gt; might help you.  There are many different views and analogies as to \n&gt; what we hear during EVP sessions.  It can be frightening at first \nto \n&gt; hear the deep groveling voices that come across your recoder or \nvoice \n&gt; mail.  The first thing that you should understand is that just \n&gt; because a voice is frightening it is not neccesarily demonic or \n&gt; negative.  Different realms or &#39;dimensions&#39; operate at varied \n&gt; vibrations.  What the human ear can discern is not neccesarily what \n&gt; is being said.  Next, you will come to understand that there is a \nlot \n&gt; out there we are not able to view with the human eye.  The world of \n&gt; EVP is full of tricksters and pranksters which will eventually lead \n&gt; you to be quite discerning when listening to EVP.\n&gt; \n&gt; My suggestion is that you empower yourself and take a stand the \nnext \n&gt; time you encounter whatever it is that is making contact with you.  \n&gt; Protect yourself with meditation or prayer or with the light of \n&gt; whatever it is you believe in.  Know . . . for certain that the \n&gt; universe will protect you if you believe it will, if you allow it \nto.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bets of luck to you my friend.\n&gt; \n&gt; Remember . . . Many will go back and forth and knowledge will \n&gt; continue . . . The book of Daniel . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;chuck255&quot; &lt;chuck255@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My name is Chuck and I stumbled upon this site and its \ninformation \n&gt; &gt; while trying to figure out what&#39;s going on in my crazy life. \nBefore \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; get into that let me explain a bit about myself. I am a  male in \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; 30&#39;s, who has Bachelors in Regional Development, with a minor in \n&gt; &gt; Computer Science. I work at a respective power plant company \nwithin \n&gt; &gt; Arizona doing GIS Tech Work. I get drug tested at it on random \n&gt; &gt; occasion and I really only drink socially, or on some holiday \n&gt; &gt; occasions. I have always been a logical kind of thinker my whole \n&gt; life \n&gt; &gt; and never really had any &quot;belief&quot; in the paranormal, even though \nmy \n&gt; &gt; mom and brother strongly do. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I feel so weird even trying to explain this story because about a \n&gt; &gt; week ago I would have thought of it as silly. About a year ago I \n&gt; met \n&gt; &gt; someone else, who for now ill call B. I fell madly in love with \nher \n&gt; &gt; and after a short time I was more than happy to have her come and \n&gt; &gt; live with me at my new place. In some strange way I always felt \nas \n&gt; if \n&gt; &gt; there was something about B I could never quite understand. After \n&gt; &gt; about 3-4 months of living with her I started to get the \n&gt; inclination \n&gt; &gt; that B was cheating on me. Her stories never added up, her job \nwas \n&gt; &gt; secretive and she started stumbling on her words a lot. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I then started getting spy gadgets, because she was staying with \nme \n&gt; &gt; and I was concerned about my place along with her activities \nthere. \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; at first just got a digital recorder, but then after time I \nstarted \n&gt; &gt; to get aggravated and felt that the digital recordings were just \n&gt; &gt; being used to play and taunt me. So then I went to the extent of \n&gt; &gt; getting Cameras and even Camcorders. Whenever I would ask about \n&gt; &gt; something peculiar, I got tears and a really heartfelt reaction \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; really made me believe her. I felt like we really loved one \nanother \n&gt; &gt; and I could really see some care in her eyes, so most of the time \nI \n&gt; &gt; just gave in to what she said as true, but didnt have enough to \n&gt; stop \n&gt; &gt; looking. I felt like I had been in enough relationships to know \nthe \n&gt; &gt; difference here. I have seen the act before and it really didn&#39;t \n&gt; look \n&gt; &gt; that way here, unless she was just really that good at fooling \n&gt; &gt; people. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; During the course of our stay there she would pitch a huge fit if \nI \n&gt; &gt; had to leave her at the apartment alone and would stop at nothing \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; try and be in my company instead. But I started to get aggravated \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; time progressed and knew something was up, because of the odd \n&gt; voices \n&gt; &gt; I would hear within the recordings. I made her stay there will \n&gt; trying \n&gt; &gt; to sneak back and see who was messing with her around my place. I \n&gt; &gt; lost it because I couldn&#39;t pinpoint it at all and last July and \ngot \n&gt; &gt; into a fight right outside of my place with three other people. \nShe \n&gt; &gt; always told me she talked to her self when I qestioned other \nvoices \n&gt; &gt; and I never could see anyone else there when she did, even with \nthe \n&gt; &gt; cameras, so I had no choice but to continue on believeing her \n&gt; still\n&gt; &gt; even though my feelings wouldn&#39;t agree to her words. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For some odd reason it just seemed as if she knew where the \ncameras \n&gt; &gt; and recorders were every time, just by the way she would exit and \n&gt; &gt; enter the apartment. So then I started putting them outside and \n&gt; about \n&gt; &gt; a month ago something crazy happened. I started listening to a \n&gt; &gt; digital recording and at the beginning of it I flat out heard B \n&gt; &gt; cheating on me with someone. I was upset and happy at the same \ntime \n&gt; &gt; that I finally had caught it and as a result I sent her away. She \n&gt; &gt; left town because all her family was in another city. She \ncouldn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; stop crying and was hysterical, especially when she saw I was \n&gt; &gt; devastated too. I thought that I had finally gotten my answers \nand \n&gt; &gt; she was just the best actress I had ever known, end of story. She \n&gt; &gt; tried to kill herself a couple of times while this was going on a \n&gt; &gt; couple months back. If it was as an act or not, I really just \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; know. But when she left last she left a note telling me not to \nlet \n&gt; &gt; her die and she hopes that I find her soon before her heart \n&gt; stopped. \n&gt; &gt; Me..I said more BS and threw the note in the garbage. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A couple of day&#39;s later curiosity got the best of me and I \nstarted \n&gt; &gt; listening to the rest of the recording. I then started to hear \nwhat \n&gt; &gt; sounded like people monitoring ME and calling me a &quot;Threat&quot;. I \n&gt; &gt; immediately start acting alarmed. Then in the recording I hear B \n&gt; exit \n&gt; &gt; the apartment in disgust after I stormed off that night, as we \nwere \n&gt; &gt; fighting about something weird yet again.  After I had left she \n&gt; &gt; started talking about setting up a &quot;Private Meeting&quot; with some \n&gt; other \n&gt; &gt; people and something about boating. Well during the beginning of \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; meeting I heard a reference to a crazy accusation that I had made \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; B awhile ago, which to me at the time confirmed she was in the \n&gt; Mafia. \n&gt; &gt; That explained all the weirdness to me and during this meeting \nthe \n&gt; &gt; voices changed a bunch as if they sounded &quot;Masked&quot; \nor &quot;Disguised&quot;, \n&gt; so \n&gt; &gt; I really had to amp up the volume. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The next day and every day after from this point on I amped up \nthe \n&gt; &gt; volume in the recording. I also had to distinguish the masked \nvoice \n&gt; &gt; by breaking the large file into smaller segments of two to four \n&gt; &gt; second intervals, in order to piece the entire recordings meaning \n&gt; &gt; together. Over time I started to interpret the masked voices \nbetter \n&gt; &gt; because I thought I was tuning my ears better to them. The voices \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; these recordings were two different males, B and some other \nfemale. \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; later on saw in the recording that they had actually seen the \n&gt; &gt; recording but weren&#39;t taking it, which was EXTREMELY odd to me \n&gt; &gt; considering they had been caught. Why not destroy the evidence? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then I heard one of the males say that he was the &quot;Boss of the \n&gt; &gt; Southwest Mafia&quot; and that I was going to pay for hurting B like \n&gt; this. \n&gt; &gt; He also said that my being a nuisance in the apartment had messed \n&gt; up \n&gt; &gt; his business within the area and all my spy stuff had really \npissed \n&gt; &gt; him off. He told me I was dead, my daughter along with me and \nmore \n&gt; &gt; than likely my whole family as well. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He knew where my mom and dad lived and some information I didn&#39;t \n&gt; even \n&gt; &gt; tell B. I freak out and figure the damn mob is after me. I keep \n&gt; &gt; listening and he says &quot;If I don&#39;t move away and discontinue my \n&gt; &gt; interactions with my daughter by December 5th, that he would know \n&gt; &gt; that I was just playing with B and then my whole family is dead&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; This was exactly one month from when I had used the recording \n&gt; device \n&gt; &gt; too by the way. I moved out and away from my daughter breaking \nthe \n&gt; &gt; tie and in tears the whole time too because I couldnt explain \nwhy. \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; really did it because I feared for their lives of my family and \n&gt; felt \n&gt; &gt; that we would all die if f I didnt. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Meanwhile B and met someone else that ill name J for now. After \n&gt; &gt; knowing him for two days she decided to bring him back with her \nto \n&gt; &gt; pick up her things out of the apartment. I was kicking her out of \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; by the way. I thought it was just to piss me off and I forgot \nabout \n&gt; &gt; it. Then I heard as I progressed in the recording J&#39;s name \nbrought \n&gt; &gt; up. Supposedly they knew him and he was in their mob and I needed \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; go attack him to prove myself, or else B will never be seen from \nme \n&gt; &gt; again. I also hear that I can&#39;t go to certain places at certain \n&gt; times \n&gt; &gt; where B might be and furthermore think that they didnt take the \n&gt; &gt; recorder because the damn thing has to be planned down to the \ntimes \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; would hear it. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At this time I am in fear for my life and my families, lost my \nlove \n&gt; &gt; and I am not understanding how the recording is so damn well time \n&gt; &gt; planned, figured im going crazy. Then something ill never forget \n&gt; &gt; happens. I am spoken directly too and I figure its me going of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; deep end now. I try and test my sanity and go to different parts \nof \n&gt; &gt; the recording only to get the same thing kind of direct question. \nI \n&gt; &gt; am in disarray at this point! I stand up and walk around, trying \nto \n&gt; &gt; figure out just what the hell is going on with me. I get back on \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; further see that my verbal questions are now being answered \n&gt; instantly \n&gt; &gt; by this recording (Which is merely a sound file on the pc). *I \nwas \n&gt; &gt; using Sound Forge by the way if anyone wanted to know what sound \n&gt; &gt; software I was using was*.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have so little sleep at this point and I am told that I need to \n&gt; do \n&gt; &gt; all this crazy stuff and drive out to the middle of some hotel \n&gt; right \n&gt; &gt; then and there, to further see them, as I have passed all their \n&gt; tests \n&gt; &gt; to get into their mafia now. As a reward B would be there waiting \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; me too. I hurry to do it and rush there but no one is even their \nto \n&gt; &gt; answer the door. I go back and get a yelling voice at me that I \nhad \n&gt; &gt; left to early and immediatly go back. Me not wanting to piss the \n&gt; mob \n&gt; &gt; boss anymore, I take the 45 minute trip again and go back. But \nwhen \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; get there it just didn&#39;t feel right to me and I never exited the \n&gt; car, \n&gt; &gt; especially when I saw the numbers in vehicles hadnt changed in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; parking lot. I had plenty reason to be paranoid at this point and \n&gt; &gt; truly felt in danger.I left and thought I was done for when I got \n&gt; &gt; back. Instead, he tells me that he was impressed by my decision \n&gt; when \n&gt; &gt; and literally puts me in tears when he said that because of my \n&gt; &gt; intelligence,  I had won my families lives back, but not my own \n&gt; yet. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; All this is done by him also telling me that he can physically \nsee \n&gt; me \n&gt; &gt; through his advanced mafia technology on the computer monitor. He \n&gt; &gt; also tells me to to move things around on my compter desk that \nwere \n&gt; &gt; between the sight of me and the computer monitor, while demanding \nI \n&gt; &gt; correct my posture when speaking to him. He also states that he \nis \n&gt; &gt; watching my every move and if I tell anyone anything they die \nalong \n&gt; &gt; with me. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I make no sense of this and I was completely baffled on how I was \n&gt; &gt; being communicated with. I had just moved and there was no \ninternet \n&gt; &gt; connection even. Me just being happy my family is safe, I decide \nto \n&gt; &gt; go to sleep. Feeling as though I am now sleep deprived and going \n&gt; &gt; crazy from the stress, I go to sleep for two days consistently, \nas \n&gt; &gt; this was during the Thanksgiving holiday time. I would purposely \n&gt; make \n&gt; &gt; myself sleep longer when I woke to ensure I didn&#39;t belong in the \n&gt; &gt; loony bin. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I finally woke up I was determined to find an explanation to \n&gt; how \n&gt; &gt; they were talking to me, I go to the library and look into \n&gt; Bluetooth \n&gt; &gt; technology, telephony, and remoting into a computer..anything. \n&gt; Then \n&gt; &gt; I realize..that I can find out just how crazy I really am by \n&gt; moving \n&gt; &gt; the recording and listening to it elsewhere. I then decide to \ntake \n&gt; &gt; the same recording into my work to test my saneness, along with \nthe \n&gt; &gt; file itself. If its was on my home CPU.then it&#39;s going to now be \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; my work one too right? I do and get the same damn thing, not to \n&gt; &gt; mention that the &quot;Mob Boss&quot; now has company two others when I \nspeak \n&gt; &gt; to him. All of them yelling at me for moving their sensive \n&gt; &gt; information. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; During this time I invest in GPS, GSM, 3G and several signal \n&gt; blocking \n&gt; &gt; devices, in order to prohibit myself from being tracked any \n&gt; further. \n&gt; &gt; They never worked or even phased the &quot;Mob Boss&quot;. But I would \nstill \n&gt; &gt; check the recording in the evening just to hear what I needed to \ndo \n&gt; &gt; in order to be making them happy and get the possibility to see B \n&gt; &gt; again. The &quot;Mob Boss&quot; had told me that it was all just a test for \n&gt; me \n&gt; &gt; to see if I loved her and she never really did do anything. They \n&gt; &gt; continue to tell me over and over that I have to beat up J in \norder \n&gt; &gt; to prove myself to B. That this is what everyone is really \nwaiting \n&gt; on \n&gt; &gt; and if I would just go up to the other town and get it over with, \n&gt; &gt; then I can bring her back with me. I won&#39;t do it and say that I \n&gt; won&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; fight for anything that doesn&#39;t want to be fought for. Basically \n&gt; &gt; saying that B can call me about it if she really wants it. Then \nas \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; result they start threatening my family again. At this point, I \n&gt; &gt; really can&#39;t even express to you how much of a wreck I am. But I \n&gt; felt \n&gt; &gt; like I needed to be strong for my family and get on the mob&#39;s \ngood \n&gt; &gt; side so I can fix the mess I created.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well it never really happened and this torment went on for a good \n&gt; &gt; week, while I was moving everything I could as fast as I could in \n&gt; &gt; order to make their deadline and save everyone. Everyday I would \ndo \n&gt; &gt; what I thought was expected of me and hope it wouldnt make them \nmad \n&gt; &gt; in one breath, while in the other breath win back my complete \n&gt; &gt; freedom, away from their bad side. No matter where I was or what \nI \n&gt; &gt; did during the day they usually seemed to know about it when I \n&gt; talked \n&gt; &gt; to them in the evening. It really bothered me that I couldnt find \n&gt; out \n&gt; &gt; where they were putting the &quot;bugs&quot;, or even better how they were \n&gt; &gt; doing all of it. My inability to &quot;believe&quot; in the paranormal \nreally \n&gt; &gt; hurt me here.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since the apartment that B and I had used was empty at this time \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; a friend of mine was down on his luck, I gave him the apartment \nfor \n&gt; &gt; free until the lease was completely up. After about a week of me \n&gt; &gt; doing this, I walked in and found guns and ammo everywhere and \n&gt; &gt; freaked the hell out. That&#39;s the last thing I needed when I \nthought \n&gt; &gt; the mob was just down the street! I made everyone there except my \n&gt; &gt; friend leave, with quite a fuss I might add. Then I headed back \nto \n&gt; my \n&gt; &gt; home to see how the mob felt about what I did, assure they would \nbe \n&gt; &gt; impressed that I had looked out for them. Instead the regular \n&gt; female \n&gt; &gt; that was always with the &quot;Mob Boss&quot; now asked me why I didn&#39;t \n&gt; finish \n&gt; &gt; the job, stating that there was still someone there and it made \n&gt; them \n&gt; &gt; all angry. They demanded that I go back especially to see just \n&gt; how &quot;I \n&gt; &gt; finished it&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So like the puppet I was at that time, I went back. I didn&#39;t have \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; heart to put him on the street, even though he had put me at a \n&gt; major \n&gt; &gt; risk and instead I just found another place for him to stay. On \nthe \n&gt; &gt; way there I bought him some water and some smokes. When we got \n&gt; there \n&gt; &gt; I even helped him move in and explained that it wasn&#39;t me that \ndid \n&gt; &gt; it, but the leasing office had saw all the guns. As a result they \n&gt; had \n&gt; &gt; made me do it. I thought he made a poor decision and I knew he \nsaw \n&gt; &gt; the same, not to mention I kind of felt bad that I had to do all \nof \n&gt; &gt; this to him at 11:30PM. I truly didnt want to make his life a \n&gt; &gt; complete hell any more than it already was and he felt better \nthat \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; had talked to him, so as a result I did as well. I then left and \n&gt; once \n&gt; &gt; again headed back home. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Certain that I was going to get good praises; I sat at the PC \nagain \n&gt; &gt; only to immediately get yelled at. They asked me why I was &quot;so \n&gt; good&quot; \n&gt; &gt; and that they had absolutely no respect for me. I tell them I \njust \n&gt; &gt; did all of that for them and they say that I always do \nthings &quot;the \n&gt; &gt; right way&quot; and they hate me for it. This is where I think I hit \nthe \n&gt; &gt; loony bin and just didnt see how I was going to fix this problem. \n&gt; &gt; Then it got worse and saw that my thoughts were now being \n&gt; &gt; communicated back to me. Then I knew it and was convinced I was \n&gt; going \n&gt; &gt; skitzo and that i was just truly arguing with myself in reality, \n&gt; &gt; especially when I saw I wasn&#39;t even speaking. I used the \nrestroom, \n&gt; &gt; splash water on my face and faintly start to hear the same mob \n&gt; people \n&gt; &gt; in my fan motor in the bathroom.  I haven&#39;t drank, done any drugs \n&gt; &gt; (even prescription) and have a pretty complex job which I can \nstill \n&gt; &gt; handle, but yet I feel like I am going crazy. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t talk to anyone about it so I sit back at the CPU, only to \n&gt; &gt; hear that I need to open up the front door. Screw that!I just \nlook \n&gt; &gt; out the window and see nothing and say no way. They ask why not \nand \n&gt; &gt; that I should trust them and I say hell no and I continue to \n&gt; &gt; hear &quot;God Damnit&quot; from them when they get mad. They continue to \nask \n&gt; &gt; me to open the door and I continue to check the window to see \n&gt; &gt; nothing. I say to knock then and they get mad and say they have \nno \n&gt; &gt; hands. They don&#39;t sound like they are joking and get mad when I \n&gt; laugh \n&gt; &gt; even, so I continue to think I am just crazy at this point. I \nasked \n&gt; &gt; why they wanted to come in and they said they wanted to fix me. I \n&gt; say \n&gt; &gt; there is nothing wrong with me and they say they hate me and want \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; eat me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I start to really think about this and say ill open the door if I \n&gt; get \n&gt; &gt; the answers to all this. They start saying things and its if as \n&gt; &gt; though they see my thought process develop and say things \n&gt; like&quot;watch \n&gt; &gt; him go&quot;. Then I hear out of my computer monitor something I \ncouldnt \n&gt; &gt; even fathom. I hear my ex-wife&#39;s ex-best friends voice. His name \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; Daniel and he had committed suicide over 5 years ago. I did know \n&gt; him, \n&gt; &gt; but not as well as she had. It WAS his voice and he said &quot;Charles \n&gt; its \n&gt; &gt; Daniel&quot; and then I heard their voice again say we are &quot;down here \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; him&quot;. At this point I didnt know really what to think, but this \n&gt; part \n&gt; &gt; in our conversation was the turning point on my beliefs and \n&gt; thoughts \n&gt; &gt; on what was really going on.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I say nothing yet they somehow can seem to hear my thoughts and \n&gt; start \n&gt; &gt; saying little things to make me think even more. It was the most \n&gt; &gt; fluent conversation I had ever had. It was truly telepathic and \nwas \n&gt; &gt; on a level I could never really explain even to myself. Then it \n&gt; &gt; really hit me and I said &quot;Demons&quot;. I tried to play something and \n&gt; got \n&gt; &gt; no response for the first time ever on the sound file. I then \n&gt; started \n&gt; &gt; piecing it all together from there and even though I wasn&#39;t a \n&gt; &gt; believer this makes more sense then I could ever write down here \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; as a result I forever will be one now. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; They ask for me to now open the door and I open the small glass \n&gt; door \n&gt; &gt; on my CPU desk and they get really pissed off, saying I tricked \n&gt; them. \n&gt; &gt; Then their voice changed to the most demonic, vile and disturbing \n&gt; &gt; voice I could ever put into words. I never really thought of \ndoing \n&gt; &gt; that until that moment and I think it was seen from them \nreaction, \n&gt; &gt; but it worked out quite nicely. I start saying the our father \n&gt; prayer \n&gt; &gt; and I can hear the displeasure in them even more and \nheard &quot;that&#39;s \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; we are going in&quot;. I immediately took off my headphones and ran to \n&gt; get \n&gt; &gt; a bible they never did as far as I can tell, but I sat there all \n&gt; &gt; night with the bible in my hand praying. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I started calling people and my phone started cutting out, the \nbulb \n&gt; &gt; on the porch blew and my good friend&#39;s girlfriend called me to \nask \n&gt; me \n&gt; &gt; for help because my friend was drunk and passed out. It sounded \n&gt; like \n&gt; &gt; she was trying to flirt with me and I asked her how &quot;A&quot; nightclub \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; and she said good and then I said didn&#39;t you actually go to &quot;B&quot; \n&gt; &gt; nightclub actually and she switches her story. I hang up and call \n&gt; &gt; back with no answer. The time was only 1:10am and they never \nleave \n&gt; &gt; until the clubs close so this was even odder. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I sat there terrified most of the night praying, until I called \nmy \n&gt; &gt; brother who told me that I have to stand up to them or I am \nfeeding \n&gt; &gt; into their fear. He like my mom has been involved in similar \nthings \n&gt; &gt; like this but after talking to both of them, neither have on this \n&gt; &gt; level. But in a refreshing breath after talking to them about \nthis, \n&gt; &gt; they did seem to believe me. But it wasnt unil I researched this \n&gt; &gt; issue and found out about EVP and how it works, did I truly know \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; I wasnt becoming a lunatic.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That brings me to today and me being at my wits end. I swear on \n&gt; &gt; everything this is all 100% true and I feel like I am crazy even \n&gt; &gt; still. Even though I hear it from no one else and have a pretty \n&gt; good \n&gt; &gt; circle of friends, not to mention that I still seem to do my job \n&gt; just \n&gt; &gt; fine as well. I havent put on my headphones or heard any voices \n&gt; since \n&gt; &gt; I tried to last listen to the recording, which was now 3 days \nago. \n&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any help and guidance here, as this all has \nreally \n&gt; &gt; destroyed my life. I deleted all the copies of the recording, \n&gt; except \n&gt; &gt; for one hardcopy. I still have the original recorder with the \nfile \n&gt; &gt; on, but I haven&#39;t tried to use the recording or recorder any \n&gt; further, \n&gt; &gt; as I refuse to continue it without any guidance. I figure its \nbest \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; avoid them, like my brother said. Maybe someone can help me \n&gt; &gt; understand all of this.  Even if I have gotten rid of these \nthings \n&gt; &gt; what does that say of B? I really spent a bunch of time making \nthis \n&gt; &gt; really need some genuine help from someone in the know. I know it \n&gt; &gt; sounds crazy but please regard this all as true. I am new to this \n&gt; &gt; stuff and will just stay away from it now, but some kind of \ninsight \n&gt; &gt; would be great.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
