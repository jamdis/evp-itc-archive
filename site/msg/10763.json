I love the British sounding accent in \nthe &quot;Are you uptight?&quot; file!! For some reason, this one sounded \nmore &quot;human&quot; to me than other speakjet files I have heard...  :)\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; New Box from Rob showed up today, the Speakjet #4.  I was planning on \n&gt; taking the day off from this, but i got sucked right back in again.  \n&gt; The files are a bit rough sounding, i was moving around a lot but got \n&gt; some good files.  I&#39;m only 2 minutes into a 8 minute session, but i \n&gt; need to eat and sleep.  I posted what i got so far, i didn&#39;t want to \n&gt; let Rob down by getting it and not posting files from it the same \nday.  \n&gt; That&#39;s not my style, i appreciate him doing that for me and hope to \nget \n&gt; much more from it as i experiment.  Remember deadscience.com is where \n&gt; to go for more info on the speakjet boxes.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
