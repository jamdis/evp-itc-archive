Thank you for your concern. 
Events that unfolded early this morning have prompted me to 
effectively close the Ghostboxhacks site for the near term. 
Do to the nature of these events it is inappropriate to discuss the 
matter in a public form such as this. 

Please do not speculate on the nature of this event. I am sorry, 
after talking to council I removed my statement from Ghostboxhacks.
I don't want to fuel wild speculation. 

I wish I could go in to greater detail, at this time I have been 
advised not to.

Thank you, Everyone for your emails and concern.
