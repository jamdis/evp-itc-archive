&gt; I&#x27;m going to have to run this one past my father, being he is a Ham
&gt; Operator (KA2RHU) in NJ for anyone who wants to know.  I took 5 files
&gt; and played them in a sequence and recorded it, it consists of tone
&gt; frequencies ranging from 100hz, 250hz, 440hz, 1khz and 10khz.  They
&gt; were 5 second clips of each and than i ran it through EvpMaker and it
&gt; sounds like morse code, but i have to brush up on it to see if it makes
&gt; any sense.  Is it possible for them to communicate through morse code?
&gt; I&#x27;ve attached a 30 second clip of the example running it through
&gt; EvpMaker.  I&#x27;ll also attach my original tone file i created.
