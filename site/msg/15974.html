<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I remember in that video clip Misty posted a few weeks ago, there was a (German?) ghost box researcher guy who said that he was in contact with his dead wife; she had told him that she didn&#x27;t know exactly how she communicated with him, just that she thought about him and it happened.  So I&#x27;m betting there isn&#x27;t a conscious process to make the box work.

&gt; I was listening to Steve Hultay&#x27;s RTSC radio show on that they did on
&gt; september 6th and they were talking about the mini box. They said that
&gt; for some reason they have to let it run for a while before they get any
&gt; messages. This then brought up a point on whether or not the spirits
&gt; have to get used to the radios before they are able to speak. So it may
&gt; be easier to announce that you are doing a session and which radio you
&gt; are using. I think experimenting is key and you just have to figure out
&gt; what works for you and your box.
&gt; 
&gt; If you&#x27;re interested in Steve&#x27;s show, you can find it here

&gt; &gt; Thanks, Misty!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I had a guy named Steve come through almost every session, so maybe he
&gt; was my &quot;tech.&quot;  The last session I had before the dry spell (when I quit
&gt; for a while due to sickness), Steve was sort of flippant and gave a
&gt; bunch of stupid answers, so now I&#x27;m kind of hoping he&#x27;s gone on
&gt; vacation.  But I did two sessions yesterday, and very little came
&gt; through except for being told that a family friend has died (I&#x27;m waiting
&gt; to see if that bit of prediction has come true).  So maybe, like you
&gt; said, Steve &quot;led&quot; everyone and made things come through clearer.  I
&gt; guess time will tell.  If he&#x27;d behave himself, I&#x27;d welcome him back.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So I&#x27;m wondering, what&#x27;s the rationale behind this comment:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; First, the MiniBox works best with time.  If you do not have two hours
&gt; to devote to a session, you might be disappointed.  You should have the
&gt; device running in the place you will be using it for at least 15
&gt; minutes; during this time you can fine tune settings and volume. Never
&gt; expect the Box to &quot;Hit the ground running,&quot; so to speak; it happens
&gt; occasionally, that an operator can turn on the box and get an immediate
&gt; message, but it hasn&#x27;t happened often in the ASUP&#x27;s tests.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://www.asup-inc.org/interimminiboxreport.htm
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I can&#x27;t imagine the above quote is good advice.  The very first moment
&gt; I turned on my little hacked box, I got a clear, loud message:  I see
&gt; you.  It freaked me out so bad, I turned it off immediately and it took
&gt; three days to work up the nerve to try again!  So I don&#x27;t know what
&gt; these people are talking about, that you can&#x27;t hit the ground running. 
&gt; I&#x27;ve read about lots of folks doing just that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was kind of thinking that shorter was better, too, but I wanted to
&gt; make sure, because if I was wrong, maybe letting it run a long time
&gt; might get even better responses...but yeah, I think they get tired, as
&gt; it probably takes a lot of effort to form those words.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was also thinking all those skeptics who say the boxes don&#x27;t work
&gt; are probably not treating their sessions like EVP -- I can never hear
&gt; much of anything during the session, only afterward when I listen back
&gt; and at very high volume.  At least for me, most of the bulk of the
&gt; communication is very, very quiet and located in between the louder
&gt; snippets of strong-signaled radio announcer voices.  I imagine it might
&gt; be louder and clearer if I took my set-up to a haunted location (or some
&gt; place lots of human emotions were felt), but since my set-up isn&#x27;t
&gt; really geared for that, I haven&#x27;t done it yet.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hiya Jill. yep everyone had a busy weekend. Many out of town at the
&gt; various events or dealing with family and work. Some are recovering from
&gt; having too much fun.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; A tech in reference to evp usually represents what some others call
&gt; a guide. A helper of sorts whether its just to get information or to
&gt; help resolve an issue. They often appear over and over and act as a
&gt; &quot;lead&quot; for the group of speakers.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; As for how long you record personally I have to say short is better.
&gt; I find that spirits speak in bursts of energy and if I record for long
&gt; periods of time I get very little but if I record for a short period of
&gt; time they make much better use of that time. Also it is much easier to
&gt; analyze short recordings in depth.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The only time Ive recorded long sessions is if I am in a group or
&gt; circle and want to record whats being said by us as well as spirit.
&gt; Being out on investigations one might choose to record there longer as
&gt; you document your investigation but for straight evp work i usually do
&gt; between 30 seconds and 3 minutes and no longer. They use the time
&gt; wisely. And the voices are much louder. When doing the group or circle
&gt; such as with a medium they also have been loud as we were but again its
&gt; much more energy in the room when doing those things.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Again its just my viewpoint and others may think differently or have
&gt; different experiences. Hope that helps!
&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi guys!  I didn&#x27;t receive any response to my last question, and
&gt; maybe that&#x27;s because everyone is busy with real life and whatnot.  I
&gt; know some of you were out of town, so I thought I&#x27;d post my question
&gt; again, hoping someone will be kind enough to offer his or her infinite
&gt; wisdom and opinions.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is a &quot;tech,&quot; and is it desirable to have one?  Is this like a
&gt; helper on the other side? I&#x27;ve tried googling this, but haven&#x27;t found
&gt; anything about this anywhere.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you guys find that it&#x27;s better to do short sessions (15
&gt; minutes) or long ones (two hours)?  Do the entities get exhausted
&gt; quickly, or do they have to get going and need time to do it?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks in advance for you answers!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jill
