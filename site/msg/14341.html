There is no one opinion or consensus on how or if to filter or "enhance".=
=A0=A0 The problem is that these programs do not understand what speech is =
either - otherwise you could press a button and have it just pull out the w=
ords and hrow everything else away.=A0=A0=A0 They work only by manipulating=
 frequencies or frequency ranges.=A0 

To some point, they can recognize no=
ise: but not all noise, and will remove some things that are not noise, and=
 leave some things behind that are noise.=A0 Carving out frequencies in thi=
s manner can result in sounds being created which were not on the original =
recording, and sound like words.

The same is true with other kinds of enha=
ncement, which again can quiet some frequencies and emphasize others.=A0 Si=
nce the program again does not know what is really a word and what is noise=
, sounds are again being reshaped, and with enough shaping, they can become=
 like speech.=A0 This is sometimes called pixelization.

Some are of the op=
inion to not filter or enhance at all: it can be hard enough to identity re=
al speech in a blank recording: torturing the frequencies just makes it mor=
e confusing.=A0 Sure, it may result in more things that sound like speech, =
but it really depends what you are after: recording accuracy, or exciting r=
esults.=A0 To get the best of both worlds, it would seem the non-processed =
method would be best.
