  In the scientific w=
orld everything related to evp is considered sketchy compared to other mean=
s of evidence.  The only way to validate that an evp is from a relative or =
loved one is to have them answer a question only known by them.  Demons are=
 known to fake things like this just to get your attention or to cause havo=
c. As far as the evp is concerned in this particular chat it wont be pushed=
 to scientific values rather to an emotional value to the person that reviv=
ed the message.  There is nothing wrong with that but in the same token, it=
 is sciences job to debunk the claim by some sort of scientific measure. NO=
NE OF THIS HAS HAPPENED IN THIS POST.  So before getting on someones case a=

  That's fine, but I think your missing my point. My point is that th=
is is not evidence as far as science is concerned. That doesn't mean that y=
our wrong, it just means that it doesn't constitute any kind of proof in th=

    there Scripture talks abou=
