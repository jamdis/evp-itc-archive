The possibility of the audio being further\ninfluenced is greater Im sure. Reminds me of when a radio show was\nbeing done on evps people recording the show played it back later to\nlisten again and heard messages to them during the play back and this\nwas being reported from tons of people. So its pretty interesting if\nyou can actually have this done, cant wait to see what happens.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s like DAH!!! Why I not think about this!? Setup an internet server \n&gt; (somehow) and connect a box to the internet to run 24/7----LIVE. Or\nmake \n&gt; coordinated short tests so remote reception can be compared to\nlocal. It \n&gt; would be an easy task to make modes and bands switchable remotely as\nwell. \n&gt; What about multiple boxes?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Just imagine, a box accessible to the world 24 hours a day, seven\ndays a \n&gt; week! It staggers the imagination! Given the nature of the voices and \n&gt; contacts, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if several people could access the\nsystem \n&gt; at the exact same time, yet all receive personal communications.\n&gt; \n&gt; Guess that would create wee ripple in the darkside!!\n&gt; \n&gt; I wasn&#39;t sure if the originator of the idea wanted his name out\nthere, I \n&gt; took it off.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Guess they want it shared!\n&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 02 Aug 2007 05:56:16 -0000\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There&#39;s no way I can stop making boxes, I just don&#39;t have the\n&gt; &gt;resuources to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; supply them to everyone that wants at this time, plus trying ot find\n&gt; &gt;waay to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; make the things more better. I am no engineer, and it takes a\nwhile to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; figure things out--as with all aspects of this life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Hey Frank,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Its me again\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I haven&#39;t had much time to work on ITC lately but I&#39;m interested in\n&gt; &gt;taking a slightly different approach using a quantum random number\n&gt; &gt;generator (unless its cost prohibitive) and computer (hoping it\n&gt; &gt;doesn&#39;t get fried).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;But... what are your thoughts on this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;What if we hooked up one of your boxes to the internet for remote\n&gt; &gt;users to attempt interaction with?  Leaning on the non-locality theory.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Couple things I&#39;m wondering about, assuming it works:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;- Would the box work &quot;better&quot; physically present at a &quot;high energy&quot;\n&gt; &gt;location?  I&#39;m refering to locations on Earth that are known to be\n&gt; &gt;high energy from lay lines, etc. &quot;portals&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;- Will the recorded audio from your box be the same recorded or heard\n&gt; &gt;audio at the remote location?  Meaning will the EVP be recordable at\n&gt; &gt;your location or only the remote users location?  Or if both, will\n&gt; &gt;they match?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Just some things I&#39;ve been thinking about lately.  Curious what you\nthink.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Tease your brain--play Clink!
