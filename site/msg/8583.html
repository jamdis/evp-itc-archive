&gt; HI
&gt; I&#x27;m one of the quiet members here.  trying to learn from everyone.
&gt; I have activity in my home. so I purchased an RCA digital recorder
&gt; which is amazing.
&gt; I have captured several EVPs, some quite clear, some a bit too fast
&gt; so I slow it down to hear it. some are voices , some answer questions, some 
&gt; are just noises.
&gt; 
&gt; does anyone have experience with EVPs on digital recorders ?
&gt; I have a ton of questions...  and need advice on some of them.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks
