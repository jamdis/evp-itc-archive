I think most are ghost hunters or &quot;investigators&quot; and waitng for something scary to happen. \n&gt; \n&gt;  If you want to &quot;investigate&quot; EVP, try staying home and recording. All the fears about demons and what not entering your home is pure BS! I&#39;ve been doing ths stuff since 2000, don&#39;t go the bogus haunted hot spot, record at home almost daily as I test my junk, no frikkin&#39; problems! Fro the most part spirits, and the various entities exist in a higher level or demension, they have full access to us anyway, there are no &quot;portals&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Yeah, I know, might as tell it to my dogs! \n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
