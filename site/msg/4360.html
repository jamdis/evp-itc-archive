Bill,   
             I would also like to add that I have heard various colleagues voices through the box while doing a session.  I think the positive energy they also produce as a way of coming through.  I just recently heard Steve's voice and laugh during an afternoon session and when asked if he in fact was also conducting a session at that time stated he was not.  I am wondering if we too leave a voice impression, such as they do with conventional EVP?  An imprint of sort, kinda like a stone recording or residual haunting?
   
  Just something to think about!
  Juli

Listening last night to the tape I did Sunday night, and the Ol' Lady 
yells out that the mattress heater was not working, and the very next 
voice on the tape is about the matress heater not working! I doubt 
very much that anyone else would hear it, but that is the probelm 
with this stuff, few hear what others hear. Was the heater 
voice "real"--I can't tell!! Maybe it's a precongnitive voice--I 
can't tell! I think we create some this stuff on the fly, which is 
very problematic for the research, but it has to be addressed.
