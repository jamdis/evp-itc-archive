<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I ain&#x27;t no expert and I&#x27;m still learning but I&#x27;ve probably gotten half a 
hundred EVP over the last few years. Some are blatantly obvious and some 
might be more questionable.

One thing I have noticed is that it appears when the background is almost 
totally quiet with just the noise generated by the electronic circuits, an 
EVP might show up but it is so weak that most people can&#x27;t hear it. On the 
other hand, it seems that a noise such as a passing car or train can be 
used and modulated by someone to produce a much louder EVP.

I&#x27;ve been a radio amateur for 41 years and have been involved in what we 
call &quot;weak-signal work&quot; for 20 or so. That includes some EME 
(Earth-Moon-Earth, or moonbounce). Many of the signals I try to hear are 
so weak as to be buried in the noise but I&#x27;ve trained my ears to be able 
to pull them out.

So I often hear things in recordings that most people cannot hear. We had 
a contest a few years ago where one radio amateur recorded a reception of 
a weak EME signal and offered a warm pat on the back to anyone who could 
get the callsign of the station in the recording.  I was one of about 5 
who got it while hundreds didn&#x27;t. (Note - he had the advantage of knowing 
ahead of time who was going to be calling him by prearranged schedule. 
None of the &quot;contestants&quot; knew that.)

One that has perplexed me is a recording of an EVP over a phone answering 
machine that I have.  The noise over the top is so horrendous that it&#x27;s 
almost impossible to pick out what the voice in it is saying.  I did 
manage to get several words and phrases. EVPmaker couldn&#x27;t get anything 
out of it at all.

Anyway, I agree with you that these entities can use background noises to 
build voices and sounds on the recordings. That&#x27;s been my experience also.

&gt; For those &quot;experts&quot; out there that would tell the rest of us what EVP is,
&gt; and how to do it, a suggestion. Try getting some education first, start with
&gt; dong some EVP recording open air, then try the various forms of white noise,
&gt; and other background noises that the entities seemingly use to build voices
&gt; out of. Then move to EVPmaker-*following the instructions* by using human
&gt; speech as the &quot;raw&quot; audio. Then proceed to tell what EVP and spirit voices
&gt; are. or are not. It is rare that spirit respects titles and degrees, and
&gt; this usually inhibits serious &quot;scientific&quot; research.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; BTW, EVPmaker is a program that runs on Windows machines. It takes a wave
&gt; (.wav) file of human speech, breaks it up in small chunks, and plays this
&gt; &quot;raw&quot; audio back through the speakers--randomly, while recording the result.
&gt; The entities manipulate the data *inside* the computer. For some &quot;reseacher&quot;
&gt; to claim there is no evidence that the program works only means the
&gt; researhcer has no idea what he&#x27;she is talking about, and comes from a
&gt; position of complete ignorance. I&#x27;m sure that you could place a cpmputer in
&gt; a faraday cage, and EVPmaker would perform it&#x27;s function.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ve heard these &quot;researchers&quot; for years all claiming to be &quot;scientific&quot;
&gt; while in fact they seek only to debunk, accpeting no evidence, as if they
&gt; got their degrees after everything knowable has already been discovered.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Bottom line, get the voices first, then tell all us unwashed masses what it
&gt; really is. In the mean time I&#x27;ll keep working on my do nothing boxes.
