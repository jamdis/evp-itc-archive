An audio file is just a file of bytes, tha=\r\nt is later interpreted by an audio player.  Two files with the exact same c=\r\nontents, whether they are audio or image or a dababase or an exe, are indis=\r\ntinguishable from each other.  That is, if I copied the contents of one to =\r\na new file, and the contents of the other to a new file, and asked you whic=\r\nh file each came from, there would be no way to tell.  Even the audio playe=\r\nr could not tell.

After a lengthy discourse with another member here, I learned that=\r\n I was wrong. The reason why I did not realize it in the first place is tha=\r\nt when I would email a wav file, I would intentionally keep it in very smal=\r\nl segments, to keep file size down. This was just for ease of transfer. But=\r\n because of this, I had not experienced any noticeable loss.\n\n             =\r\n                   Now it may be in some cases, depending on the servers or=\r\n what have you that the file goes through, that the loss may be less or mor=\r\ne.

For example, if I had a program in some .exe files, and I sent it o=\r\nver email, it could compress it.  But if it lost even one bit, the resultin=\r\ng exe file would not execute again after it was uncompressed on the other s=\r\nide.\n\n                                This kind of compression does things =\r\nlike looking for common patterns in the file, and replacing them with a tok=\r\nen.  A rough example would be if it found &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot; in a file 20 tim=\r\nes, it could replace all the occurances with say $HN1.  And also write a li=\r\nttle dictionary in there someplace that says &quot;$HN1=3DHowdy Neighbor&quot;.\n\n    =\r\n                            When the file gets to its destination it can be=\r\n uncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are replaced with &quot;Howdy Neighbor=\r\n&quot;.  So it was compressed (instead of 14 characters each, it only needed 4, =\r\nplus the dictionary), but lost no data.\n\n                                So=\r\nme formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not lossless.  Depending on the level of=\r\n compression, some level of data is lost, and so cannot be recovered or rec=\r\nonstructed later.\n\n                                Rick\n\n\n\n                =\r\n                --- On Sun, 5/10/09, April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh=\r\n ostresearch. com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n                                From: April Abe=\r\nrcrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt;\n                           =\r\n     Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n                          =\r\n      To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n                                Date: Su=\r\nnday, May 10, 2009, 10:26 AM\n\n\n\n                                Another thi=\r\nng:\n\n                                I recently found this out.

Imagine taking a pictu=\r\nre of a field of flowers, and beginning to add levels or pixelization to th=\r\ne picture.  Soon, you would not be able to tell there were flowers there at=\r\n all.  You would see a lot of colored blocks.\n\n                            =\r\n    Or in the other direction, imagine you are looking at a competely rando=\r\nmize bunch of pixes on your screen: a complete screen of truely random stat=\r\nic snow.  Pixelizing this, after a while, you would again start to see colo=\r\nred blocks.\n\n                                What&#39;s happening is that it is=\r\n processing an area of the image, taking (for instance) the average value o=\r\nf that entire area, and replacing all the blocks in that area with the aver=\r\nage.  In video processing, this would result in a field of multi-colored fl=\r\nowers being replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish block, with no =\r\nresemblance to flowers.  In the noise example, it maybe replace all the ran=\r\ndom pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.  If you did not know befo=\r\nrehand what the original picture was, you couldn&#39;t tell whether your pixeli=\r\nzed image was really a field of flowers, a chevy, the sky with clouds, or a=\r\n random bunch of pixels.\n\n                                It works the same=\r\n with the sound files.

\n                                A rough example woul=\r\nd be if it found &quot;Howdy \n                                Neighbor&quot; in a fil=\r\ne 20 times, it could replace \n                                all the occur=\r\nances with say $HN1.&nbsp;
