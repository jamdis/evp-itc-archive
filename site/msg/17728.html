<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

Well, yes, and five years ago, I was getting $3k for being one of the speakers at weekend events.  The economy changes, sometimes dramatically, and our fees change accordingly.

These days, most of what we do includes paying out-of-pocket for gas or airfare, plus motels of dubious distinction, en route.  At about 80% of events, no speaker&#x27;s fee is involved. (In case you&#x27;re wondering, the hotel or other meeting rooms where events are hosted... that&#x27;s where most of the money goes.)

Guest appearances on reality TV shows rarely pay anything at all. (Not such a great &quot;reality&quot;... huh? *chuckle and sigh*)  However, a TV appearance is a credential that can (usually just briefly) allow us to charge more for our services.

In boom or bust, we keep doing what we do. We aspire to earn enough when times are good, to keep the bills paid when they&#x27;re not so great.

I don&#x27;t know anyone in this field who wouldn&#x27;t rather be doing something else, preferably with a steady paycheck.  We do this because we can&#x27;t NOT do it.  If anyone is getting rich in this field, I have yet to meet them.

I don&#x27;t want sympathy, but I also don&#x27;t want someone digging through my 11+ year old website, finding a page with my old fees, and deciding I&#x27;m doing this for the money. 

I&#x27;m on this list to learn about the box, and similar devices.  I want to understand what they do, why we hear impossibly consistent voices on them, how to improve the results, and what the significance of this is.

I can&#x27;t remain silent when someone suggests that a fellow researcher is money motivated.  But really, let&#x27;s get back on-topic.

Sincerely,
Fiona
