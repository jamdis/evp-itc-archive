&gt; Hi Leah.  Some months ago, Stefan created an allophones files (I think it&#x27;s 72 speech 
&gt; fragments based on the Speak Jet chip) to use in conjunction with his EVP Maker 
program.  
&gt; Because the allophones file contains only fragments and not complete words or 
sentences 
&gt; (though to be sure, some fragments can sound like words, ie:  &quot;I&quot; &quot;ear/hear&quot; etc) there 
isn&#x27;t 
&gt; an easy explanation for the responses which are produced by it ... responses that are 
not 
&gt; only complete sentences, but relevant to the topic of the session.
&gt; 
&gt; I think using the allophones file goes a long way in helping to rule out false positives.  I 
&gt; have actually had multiple sessions where real-time communication has taken place 
back 
&gt; and forth between myself and the person in spirit communicating via this set-up.  :-)

&gt; &gt; Are you talking about the computer program EVP Maker from Germany?  All it does is 
&gt; jumble whatever come through the mike, there is no way to be sure you actually get 
&gt; anything.  Unless you know something that I don&#x27;t about it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Take care,
