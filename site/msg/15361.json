It was the latest in a growing heap of information, =\r\ntheories, fears, warnings, enlightenment and anxiety about the year 2012, s=\r\no perhaps it&#39;s time I throw in my two cents. \n\n          I have never put m=\r\nuch stock in the supposed Mayan prophecy that 2012 will mark the end of the=\r\n world, the end of an era or however you want to view it. I mean, haven&#39;t w=\r\ne been through this countless times? Some predicted May 5, 2000, as doomsda=\r\ny because the planets were in rough alignment. Then there was the hysteria =\r\nover the millennium and Y2K. And of course various religious cults have nam=\r\ned date after date when the world would surely end, all of which came and w=\r\nent without so much as a hiccup. \n\n          The year 2012 will be no diffe=\r\nrent. Yes, the subject is selling a lot of books, drawing large audiences f=\r\nor talk radio and counting up lots of hits on websites, but I think that&#39;s =\r\nthe most drama we&#39;ll get out of 2012. It, too, will come and go without a m=\r\najor shift on the planet. Don&#39;t we all really know that? \n\n          Those =\r\npromoting the 2012 changes have thrown out a wide range of possibilities fo=\r\nr what might happen =E2=80=93 everything from a literal end of the world, t=\r\no dramatic social, economic, political and climatic upheaval, to a &quot;spiritu=\r\nal awakening,&quot; which, of course, could mean almost anything.\n\n          Why=\r\n 2012?\n\n          And what is it based on? Primarily, it&#39;s based on an anci=\r\nent Mayan &quot;long count&quot; calendar, carved on stone, which according to calcul=\r\nations ends on December 21, 2012 and marks the end of a 5,126-year era. Wit=\r\nhout a doubt, the ancient Mayans were remarkable mathematicians and astrono=\r\nmers, but can we really take this &quot;prophecy&quot; seriously? First of all, it&#39;s =\r\nnot even a prophecy. It happens to be when their long count calendar ends. =\r\nWhy should that hold any significance for us? \n\n          The second reason=\r\n proponents of this coming apocalypse say it is on its way is that in 2012 =\r\nthere will be an alignment of sorts with the center of our galaxy. Because =\r\nthe Earth wobbles slowly as it rotates (once about every 26,000 years) the =\r\nsun will appear to rise in alignment with the center of the Milky Way. Inte=\r\nresting, yes, but there seems to be no cosmological evidence of any kind th=\r\nat this should have an effect on our planet, physically, socially or even s=\r\npiritually. \n\n          The third reason touted is that the sun is schedule=\r\nd to be at a &quot;solar maximum&quot; in that year, a time when sun spots and solar =\r\nflares are very active. This kind of activity really can cause problems. Su=\r\nch activity can disable and damage satellites and can have a dramatic effec=\r\nt on the Earth&#39;s weather. The schedule is based on past patterns of such ac=\r\ntivity, but we have no way of knowing whether it will happen in 2012, and i=\r\nf it does how severe it might be. \n\n          Strained Interpretations\n\n   =\r\n       Back to the Nostradamus documentary for a moment. As usual, the Nost=\r\nradamus experts quoted a selection of his quatrains =E2=80=93 those that fe=\r\nature famine, pestilence, war, etc. =E2=80=93 and strained to tie them into=\r\n 2012. Not successfully, in my opinion. The world has always been plagued w=\r\nith famine, pestilence, war and the rest of it, and I saw no quatrain that =\r\neven remotely indicated that what Nostradamus was talking about was the yea=\r\nr 2012.\n\n          Aside from the quatrains, the documentary focused mainly=\r\n on the so-called &quot;Lost Book of Nostradamus, &quot; which was discovered in a mo=\r\ndern library in Rome in 1994. Dating to 1629, the manuscript, filled the br=\r\night watercolor drawings, is titled Nostradamus Vatinicia Code and has on t=\r\nhe inside the name Michel de Notredame as the author. First of all, althoug=\r\nh this &quot;lost book&quot; is thought by some to be the work of Nostradamus, there =\r\nis no definitive proof or scholarly consensus that he was actually the auth=\r\nor; some experts have serious doubts. So to make this book the platform for=\r\n this documentary puts it on very shaky ground. \n\n          And then the le=\r\nngths to which the talking heads on the show reached and strained to connec=\r\nt the drawings to 2012 was positively ludicrous. For example, the drawing o=\r\nf a sword, held pointing up and around which is looped a banner or scroll (=\r\nsee illustration above) =E2=80=93 this was interpreted as the sun&#39;s alignme=\r\nnt with the galactic center in 2012. Really? The other drawings were likewi=\r\nse twisted and mangled to fit the interpretations needed for the argument. =\r\nWe all know that we can take such enigmatic drawings =E2=80=93 and quatrain=\r\ns =E2=80=93 and interpret them to fit virtually any scenario that we want. =\r\n\n\n          So What Will Happen?\n\n          Why are some people obsessed wi=\r\nth 2012 (apart from its marketing aspects)? Why are they obsessed with apoc=\r\nalypse and the end of the world? Why is it always seen as right around the =\r\ncorner? \n\n          I think the answer is that we both fear and want great =\r\nchange. As wonderful as the world can be, it is, as noted earlier, continua=\r\nlly plagued by war, economic difficulties, famine and climate shifts. This =\r\nstuff is not new. They are continuing problems that ebb and flow on the pla=\r\nnet. While we fear that it&#39;s going to get worse (and it certainly can get w=\r\norse), at the same time we have the hope that it&#39;s going to get better. We =\r\nfear the catastrophes of an apocalypse, yet we hope for that spiritual awak=\r\nening that will save us from our own human nature. \n\n          I&#39;m no Nostr=\r\nadamus, but here&#39;s my prediction for 2012: the world will continue on prett=\r\ny much as it has in the past. There will be dire problems and there will be=\r\n great joys. Perhaps some problems will get a bit worse than they are right=\r\n now, but there will be no earth-shattering catastrophe. If there is a spir=\r\nitual awakening, it won&#39;t be on a planetary or mass scale through some unsp=\r\necified miracle, as some hope, it will be as individuals. (But that has not=\r\nhing to do with 2012.) The best we can shoot for is that as individuals we =\r\ndo our best to make our own small fragments of the Earth better places. Thi=\r\ns has always been the case and ever shall be.\n       \n\n\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_028B_01CA065A.57FAD4C0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n=EF=BB=BF&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HT=\r\nML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Dutf-8&quot; http-equiv=3DContent=\r\n-Type&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18783&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;B=\r\nODY style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=\r\n=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;I thought it was good as well.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2px solid; PADDING-L=\r\nEFT: 5px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; \ndir=3Dl=\r\ntr&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;/DIV&gt;\n =\r\n &lt;DIV \n  style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial; BACKGROUND: #e4e4e4; font-color: black&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; \n  &lt;A title=3Drasterer@... href=3D&quot;mailto:rasterer@yaho=\r\no.com&quot;&gt;Rj&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A title=\r\n=3DEVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-I=\r\nTC@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B=\r\n&gt; Thursday, July 16, 2009 7:26 \n  PM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; Re: [EVP-ITC] Nostradamus &amp; \n  2012&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n  &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n =\r\n &lt;P&gt;\n  &lt;TABLE border=3D0 cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0&gt;\n    &lt;TBODY&gt;\n    &lt;=\r\nTR&gt;\n      &lt;TD vAlign=3Dtop&gt;I believe the documentary this article reference=\r\ns was \n        actually a repeat, and shown earlier in the year.&nbsp; Stil=\r\nl, it&#39;s a \n        great review and I pretty much agree with everything the=\r\n author had to \n        say.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Thu, 7/16/09, April A=\r\nbercrombie &lt;I&gt;&lt;&lt;A \n        href=3D&quot;mailto:april@abercrombieghostresearch=\r\n.com&quot;&gt;april@abercrombiegh&lt;WBR&gt;ostresearch.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; \n       =\r\n wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n        &lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px so=\r\nlid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: \n          April Abercrombie &lt;&lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:april@...&quot;&gt;april@abercrombiegh&lt;WBR&gt;ostresearch.&lt;=\r\nWBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: \n          [EVP-ITC] Nostradamus &amp; 2012&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nTo: &quot;EVP-ITC Group&quot; \n          &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Date=\r\n: Thursday, July 16, 2009, \n          5:59 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n          &lt;DIV id=3Dy=\r\niv1960883166&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n          &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n          =\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT size=3D4 face=3Dverdana&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#800000&gt;Does Nostradamus \n     =\r\n     agree with the Mayan calendar about a coming \n          change?&lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D1&gt;By Stephen Wagner, July \n          13, 20=\r\n09&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/B&gt;On July 10, 2009, The History Channel \n          ai=\r\nred a two-hour documentary on the prophecies of Nostradamus and how \n      =\r\n    they might relate to 2012.
