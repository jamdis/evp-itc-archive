<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Stefan,

Great advice about this idea, i just did a 2 minute session using 
your settings and i think i got some good stuff.  I will post a file 
i just got next.  I think when you are in tune to get communication 
with the other side, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether it&#x27;s a box or Evp 
Maker.  If they want to talk with you, you will get communication 
with whatever you use.  I&#x27;ve had success with manual sweeps as well, 
boxes are just easier to use for most of us.

&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; the wav file has a cue list embedded into it, consisting of 72 
cues - one for each allophone. If EVPmaker is set up to use the 
embedded cue list, the other settings such as Overlap, Zerocross, 
Crossfade, Segment size etc. don&#x27;t apply, thus they will be greyed 
out. These options, and the &quot;Use Cue List&quot; option, exclude each 
other. If &quot;Use Cue List&quot; should be greyed out, then uncheck the other 
options.

&gt; &gt; Stefan,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That&#x27;s a great file, i&#x27;m going to do a test session with that 
today.  
&gt; &gt; Hopefully i&#x27;ll get some good stuff, how did you have EVPmaker 
set.  
&gt; &gt; Such as (overlap, z-cross,x-fade) and the number settings.  I&#x27;m 
going 
&gt; &gt; to test out different ones, but was curious of how you set it up.
&gt; &gt;
