Frank,
 
I have received real contact.  It was very simple and easy on my part,  all I 
did was ask for help and the help was provided.  I have actually  reached out 
and touched somebody, LOLOL.  Sorry I always loved that phrase  from the 
phone company.  But I have reached out and touched, to my  amazement.  But when I 
have played back he recordings of the sessions a lot  of the audio is not 
there.  There is the truth that some things are only  meant for me to hear and not 
for anyone else.  I wish they could be  recorded so I could substantiate this 
but at this time I cannot.  And as  you already know they do have the ability 
to predict the future.  Some  things about the future we should never know 
but alas it does come thru to  us.  Again it could not be recorded or 
substantiated.    I  am still waiting for a certain date to come to see if the predicted 
future will  actually happen.  I pray that it doe not.  But in the even that 
it  does you will be the first ones to be informed of this.
 
Jeff
