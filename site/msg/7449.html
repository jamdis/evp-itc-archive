<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello all !!
I have been lurking on the board for awhile, feeling not much to 
contribute.
I am interested in this connection and communication (Thanks to 
Debbie !!)
I&#x27;ve observed a few things on the board.  Somehow this word &quot;purple&quot; 
keeps popping up and I can&#x27;t help but to think of the color purple in 
the spectrum.  Does the color relate to some sort of sound wave 
also ? or correlates to something in the electronic field that your 
helpers from the other side are trying to propose ?

Also, I have noticed that the Frank boxes do not seem to be 
distributed to many women (is this because women do not have good 
results with the other side ?)
I know Debbie has done a lot of successful work, but, does this mean 
that women have a more difficult time with communication ?

I don&#x27;t have a box and I don&#x27;t know how to build one !! I went to 
radio shack and whatever was recommended is replaced with the new 470.

I don&#x27;t know where to begin except that Frank recommended starting 
with EVPMAKER.  I&#x27;d like to build something of my own and don&#x27;t know 
where to start with a receiver/scanner of my own.
I&#x27;d be so happy if someone could share some technology with me !!!??
thanks, Holly</pre>
