&gt;  So humbling to try to talk to this group with so many years 
experience, and the intellects! Very humbling! 
&gt;  
&gt;  If I may be so bold as the to suggest this voice is Raudive, as he 
has a very distinctive tonal quality. Secondly, there was concerns 
that little technical advice is received, just my small minded 
opinion, but we have the electronics, and the boxes in various forms 
work. There is little more to this type of device, except as in this 
voice, some minor tweaking of components.
&gt;  
&gt;  &quot;A copper box&quot; go to Radio Shack, buy copper clad circuit board, 
cut to desired size, solder togother with gun type soldering iron (I 
think it&#x27;s 120 and 300 watts). Drill holes for mic and speaker. Of 
course, that&#x27;s just the way I would do it. There has to be a much 
simpler, cheaper, and better way. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Thank your for you time, sorry for the intrusion.
