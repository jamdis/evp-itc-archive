All that review time makes for a\nvery tedious few hours.  By the end of it you&#39;re ready to pull your\nhair out.  I&#39;ve only done two sessions now and have gotten more\npositive results in 20 minutes time as I have in 10 years of EVP research.\n\nJeremy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Very interested. And I agree with you about the overnight change.  \n&gt; Orgs like AA-EVP that aren&#39;t dealing with the boxes are missing the  \n&gt; boat.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; On Jan 28, 2008, at 8:48 PM, Jules wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well guys, I have to tell you that since I started box sessions in\n&gt; &gt; November I have become so spoiled that conventional EVP just don&#39;t do\n&gt; &gt; it for me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My organization was asked to come and do an investigation at a very\n&gt; &gt; historial place (here in Illinois). The owner of this home asked if I\n&gt; &gt; would bring one of the boxes to the home (he is amazed with the\n&gt; &gt; immediately 2 way communication). So upon respectfully asking my tec\n&gt; &gt; if it was alright to do a session outside the my home we did several\n&gt; &gt; box sessions along with conventional EVP. We wanted to see if we could\n&gt; &gt; discover some unanswered history about the residence, and the  \n&gt; &gt; otherside\n&gt; &gt; was more than willing to comply.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have to tell you that the regular EVP recordings were and are the\n&gt; &gt; most boring data to review. Something I use to love so much has\n&gt; &gt; actually turned into a project given I am waiting for a response\n&gt; &gt; immediately! Too funny how things can change overnight!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I will be uploading some files for these sessions if you are  \n&gt; &gt; interested.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Juli\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
