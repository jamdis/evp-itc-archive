<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank,

could it perhaps be that the elcos (electrolytic capacitors) are causing
the problem? Have you ever tried to use ceramic capacitors instead?
Perhaps the elcos have a tiny leakage current which are amplified by the
opamps until the output gets overloaded. - Just a thought...

&gt;  Oh yeah, btw, I did get the sockets in I was waiting for, that&#x27;s why the work on the RNG part of the Speakjet board.   I think I&#x27;ve always had this weird mis-match problem with the white noise
&gt; circuit, but going from op amp stage to op amp stage as in the RVG, it&#x27;s not as apparent. There could be a number of factors, maybe just changing the op amp type would solve the problem(?) I was
&gt; seeking a more universal solution with the addition of the buffer stage, so it won&#x27;t matter so much which op amp is used.
