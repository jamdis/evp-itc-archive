&gt; &gt; Frank--I have listened to this APSR broadcast and was incredibly
&gt; impressed with what occurred at this event. Chris&#x27;s box is quite
&gt; capable of behaving like John Edward--directly bringing relations
&gt; through to talk to those who need to hear them. Some of the 
responses
&gt; were astoundingly clear and loud. It certainly sounded similar to 
what
&gt; I have heard of what Bruce is getting, and honestly, it is exactly
&gt; what I hope to get with my box when I receive it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you haven&#x27;t listened to this, you really should. I think Chris
&gt; made his usual statements about Edison and the 30, but aside from
&gt; that, this was a wonderful session and people were extremely moved.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you want, I&#x27;ll find the URL.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Christopher was immediately taken by what he had seen and heard.
&gt; He was able to &gt; make a direct connection with spirits. inhabitants,
&gt; victims, participants, and &gt; witnesses...describing amazing events 
and
&gt; even some unspeakable acts that had &gt; happened within the walls of
&gt; these notoriously haunted places. The details &gt; afforded by these
&gt; spirits gave answers to lingering questions that could not &gt; have 
come
&gt; from anyone but the parties involved. Already amazed by the &gt;
&gt; instrument&#x27;s ability to connect with these historical figures,
&gt; Christopher soon &gt; realized that other entities were trying to reach
&gt; out as well. Deceased fathers, &gt; sons, mothers, daughters, and 
friends
&gt; of session participants were sending &gt; messages through the device.
&gt; Talk of this spread, and last year, at the Ghost &gt; Chaser&#x27;s Weekend
&gt; Conference in Savannah, Georgia, Christopher was asked to do a &gt;
&gt; presentation about his research with the Telephone to the Dead. This
&gt; quickly &gt; turned into an impromtu public demonstration, with
&gt; participants, one by one, &gt; coming forward requesting to speak with
&gt; loved ones who had died. Surprisingly, &gt; even to Christopher, these
&gt; requests were met with comforting and sometimes vital &gt; messages. 
The
&gt; presentation was recorded and broadcasted by A.P.S.R. Radio.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; From a recent add for another presentation, but apparently the
&gt; rest of us get nothing like this, so it doesn&#x27;t even work for us.
&gt; Guess I&#x27;ll just go back to killing time wth Ham radio, and quit
&gt; wasting all my time and money on useless boxes. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Curious that no one else gets any &quot;real&quot; contacts--event the so
&gt; called box inventor gets nothing.
