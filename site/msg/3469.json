That&#39;s why it&#39;s expensive + they were discontinued - due to the EVP &quot;voices&quot;!!!  =Judy=            . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     \n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Why is this such a prized DVR?  I don&#39;t see that you can even download the \n&gt; audio to your computer.\n&gt; \n&gt; I paid about $60 for a brand-new Olympus VN-960PC.  It records 6 hours in \n&gt; hi-quality mode and comes with USB connector cable and software to copy \n&gt; your files to your computer.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve also used it to record ham radio conversations, Morse code and bird \n&gt; calls and it does an excellent job for all of those. Radio Shack carries \n&gt; similar models made by Olympus now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, 28 Nov 2007, judy_in_hollywood wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi All, For those who have money to get it . . . . this is on Ebay = to \n&gt; &gt; get EVP&#39;s . . . . only bad part is it&#39;s $575. + S/H!  =Judy=\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
