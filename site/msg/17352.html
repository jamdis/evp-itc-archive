<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

When it comes to EVP, I was one of the most cynical/skeptical people ever.  Well, I was until about two weeks ago.

Then, a box cut me off in the middle of a rhetorical question. It was speaking clearly -- and directly to me -- from across the room. That got my attention in a hurry.

Electronics is not my field, so I won&#x27;t pretend to understand how the box works, but I&#x27;m pretty darned sure it&#x27;s not all in my head.

Though I was a very busy speaker that weekend, I kept trying to be around the box during our ghost investigations, etc., just to hear more.  

It would be so much simpler if I could shrug this off and say, &quot;It&#x27;s probably just my imagination.&quot;

Instead, I want to know more about the voices, what they&#x27;re saying, why they&#x27;re saying what they do, and... well, what they are.  

To me, this is fascinating because of the potential variables.

But, this isn&#x27;t convenient and it wasn&#x27;t what I had in mind when I packed my bag to speak in Canada.  Right now, I should be finishing three books I&#x27;m writing, one of which is very overdue.

Instead, I&#x27;m sitting here, wide-eyed, listening to recordings posted to this Yahoo Group, and I&#x27;m trying to put this into a context that I can easily compartmentalize.

So far, that&#x27;s not working.  I&#x27;m finding no easy answers.

Oh, I&#x27;m grateful to each person who&#x27;s posting their recordings. Thank you!  But each recording makes me even more sure that I haven&#x27;t a clue what this is... and that&#x27;s a challenge that&#x27;s singing a siren song. 

Cheerfully,
Fiona

&gt; how the voices are formed--in our heads and imply it&#x27;s all imagination.
