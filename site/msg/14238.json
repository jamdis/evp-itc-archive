The same g=\r\noes for storing it on any other file share site. Just post a link and let u=\r\ns know when you upload new files. \n\n        I don&#39;t mean to seem anal but I=\r\n just went thru and cleaned out all the wav files and that alone took up mo=\r\nre than 40% of our groups total space. For instance one member has posted a=\r\nbout 10 files in mp3 format which didnt even equal 1/4 of the space taken u=\r\np by another members single wav format file. When it comes down to being 98=\r\n% full you realize some changes have to be made and this is just one of the=\r\n many changes this group has had to make to allow more members to join us a=\r\nnd have fair access.\n\n        For those who are posting many files I sugges=\r\nt you do the same because eventually it will come down to one of the mods a=\r\nsking you to do so in order to clear some room. I like the idea of post now=\r\n then remove after a time period but the truth is that some peoples files n=\r\need to remain without restraint such as Stefans who has been more than gene=\r\nrous to post some files which may come in very handy for some of you to exp=\r\neriment with using his EVPmaker software. These files are for the group as =\r\na whole to make use of and they will not be deleted. \n\n        That being s=\r\naid, ask for help when you need it and feel free to share with people using=\r\n the best possible approach for the group as a whole rather than as an indi=\r\nvidual. When there were only 5 of us here it wasnt a big deal, but once you=\r\n get past 500 it starts to take a toll and sacrifices must be made. Ive del=\r\neted alot of things I didnt wish to and had to ask alot of members who have=\r\n been around a very long time to help clear some space and they did so will=\r\ningly for the betterment of the group. They had some really great files too=\r\n. Most now share them other ways including Sumption who started this group =\r\nhimself. \n\n        Misty\n\n\n\n        --- On Wed, 5/13/09, SnowfireL@... =\r\n&lt;SnowfireL@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n          From: SnowfireL@... &lt;SnowfireL@a=\r\nol.com&gt;\n          Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: File uploading rules DO NOT UP=\r\nLOAD WAV FILES\n          To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n          Date: Wednes=\r\nday, May 13, 2009, 3:12 AM\n\n\n          I have a question, how does anyone k=\r\nnow where to fine someone&#39;s files to hear them in esnips?
