<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Interesting. It seems like they try to skip around your questions about life after death. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re supposed to know.

&gt; Out of curiosity did anyone see that video?  I posted where questions  were 
&gt; asked regarding life after death and all the voice responses I got?  I  
&gt; thought it was a good one, because of all the responses I received.

&gt;  
&gt; The question was asked, Is there life after death, and I got all kinds of  
&gt; affirmative answers. At 0.05 sec. &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; 0.15 &quot;There must be&quot; 0.16 
&gt; &quot;faith&quot;  At: 0.27 &quot;mucho&quot; &quot;yes&quot; 0.31 &quot;Yes&quot; 0.34 &quot;Praise Him&quot; 0.35 &quot;Bonnie&quot; 0.53 
&gt; &quot;yes&quot; at  0.53 &quot;you&#x27;ll see&quot;  Then I hear a childs voice at 0.99 say either, 
&gt; &quot;Jacob or  wake up&quot; At 1.03 sec. I hear, &quot;has to be&quot; at 1.09 &quot;they&#x27;ll be&quot; At 
&gt; 1.27 &quot;Mc  Donald&quot;  at 1.44 &quot;hi&quot;  at 1.48 &quot;on the floor&quot; at 2.29 &quot;I was 
&gt; hoping&quot;  &quot;yep&quot; I asked r u on a lower plain, that&#x27;s when I hear &quot;yes.&quot;  At 3.26 
&gt; I  hear name, Howard, powerful then at 3.54 &quot;clear it for Ms Stebbins&quot; at 
&gt; 3.56 I  hear my mother&#x27;s voice call my name&quot;Bonnie&quot; at 4.00 I hear, &quot;they see  
&gt; themselves&quot; I had my cam close to the ghost box, so it made a reflection. 
&gt; At  4.21 &quot;I&quot;ll say&quot; then they answer my other question, when I asked them how 
&gt; long  the line was going from the low plains of darkness toward the light, 
&gt; they say at  4.24 &quot;54 miles,  it is long&quot;   then it&#x27;s long that I get at 
&gt; 4.42  &quot;they will come&quot; at 4.52 :what&#x27;s up?&quot; &quot;Hi&quot; then I got some names, at  
&gt; 5.10  &quot;pushing back here&quot; at 5.23 &quot;Walt, Frank, Herbie&quot;  and when I go to close 
&gt;  down, I got at 5.46 &quot;love you&quot; &quot;love you&quot;  at 5.57 &quot;Rick save me a  place&quot; 
&gt;   They tell me that I just got started with the session at,  6.12 At 6.23 I 
&gt; hear my mother&#x27;s voice again, calling out my name, &quot;  Bonnie&quot;  Upon closing 
&gt; the session, I hear, at 6.46 &quot;we love  ya&quot;
