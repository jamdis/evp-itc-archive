Ann,
 
I hear this file loud and clear without the slow down.
 
I have a q=
uestion, Do you have an RS box or what other
boxes do you have besides a mi=
nibox?
 
The reason I'm asking is if you have other boxes you will want to =
rotate them equally
and do sessions with all. The reason for that is you wi=
ll allow your tech/guide to stay 
familiar and associated with all the boxe=
s you have and you will want your "ear" to be attuned
to the rhythm and sou=
nd of all your boxes so that at any given time you can use anyone for a ses=
sion and 
be successful in understanding the communication. Also you may fi=
nd that at a particular time you may be 
doing a session with the MB and no=
t getting good results, you can switch to the RS 470 and have a better sess=
ion.
 
In any case you will want to have research results from all the vari=
ous boxes available to you.
 
Bruce
