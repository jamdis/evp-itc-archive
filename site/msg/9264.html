<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I can produce very high-quality boards.  I recently made 8 boards for a 
ham radio millimeter-wave project - 47 and 78 GHz mixers. They were etched 
on 5-mil thick Duroid 5870. That stuff is like paper. The tolerances at 
those frequencies is incredibly small. Hopefully they work. They look like 
they should.

But run-of-the-mill boards I have no problem with.  I can make boards on 
1/16 inch thick G-10 fiberglass-epoxy board for a couple dollars each. As 
I mentioned, the only drawback is with double-sided boards. I have to use 
feedthrough wires instead of plated-through holes.

If you (Frank) have a circuit pattern some time that you&#x27;re willing to let 
me try, I can make a few boards and we can see how they work.

&gt; That is some expensive boards, but I&#x27;m not really sure.  Hell it might be a deal.  WHat would I know.  I know how to turn on the box and start receving messages, but I&#x27;m at the learning stage.  I reading a book on basic electronics.

&gt; I&#x27;ve tried to make boards myself, but it&#x27;s just one word c-r-a-p-p-y!

&gt;&gt; Hi Frank,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I think you mentioned once before you were thinking about using
&gt; PCBExpress
&gt;&gt; to make boards. I could probably make them a lot cheaper than they
&gt; do.
&gt;&gt; The only drawback I have is that if they are double-sided boards, I
&gt; can&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; do plated-through holes and have to use &quot;C&quot; wires for thru-board
&gt;&gt; connections.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I hate to ask for anything. I can afford what I need for myself.
&gt; What I want to do is make some printed circuit boards that have the
&gt; sweep, and amplifiers, then I would only have to add whatever tuner I
&gt; want to use to form a system, and I could make the boards available.
&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t mind putting this stuff together for others, but the
&gt; requests/demands are so overwhelming, there just isn&#x27;t enough time.
