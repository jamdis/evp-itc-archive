I&#39;m \n&gt; thinking use the buffer full line to gate random numbers in from a \n&gt; white noise RNG on the serial line(?). I haven&#39;t read enough of the \n&gt; manual yet about the data, if it needs to be in a certain form or \n&gt; what. Is it just bits, or is it bytes? I&#39;m all rusty and coroded \n&gt; when it comes to digital.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Need to know the score, the latest news, or you need your \nHotmail-\n&gt; get your &quot;fix&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; http://www.msnmobilefix.com/Default.aspx\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
