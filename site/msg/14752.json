The=\r\n homeowners were not present during the investigation. These surges can eas=\r\nily be explained as mundane and therefore we must assume it is. If we can&#39;t=\r\n rule out all mundane sources, then we have to assume it is not paranormal.=\r\n\n\n  These were electrical surges. The only time we had EMF spikes was when =\r\nthese taps would be heard. The meter would spike, and then immediately retu=\r\nrn to 0.\n\n  &quot;Do your readings in your notes? Were you reading electrical or=\r\n magnetic\n  fields? What type of EMF meter were you using?&quot;\n\n  Yes we logge=\r\nd all readings. We were reading EMF, so a bit of both. We had several types=\r\n of meters present. At one point, we had 2 KII meters a few feet apart in t=\r\nhe living room. On some taps, one would go off, and others, the other one w=\r\nould go off. Most spikes fell in the 2.5 mg range, but a couple went off th=\r\ne scale.\n\n  It also explains some of the other activity the homeowners comp=\r\nlained about-the touch lamp, kitchen lights dimming, etc.\n\n  Again, these s=\r\nurges were constant, though not uniform.\n\n  April\n\n    ----- Original Messa=\r\nge ----- \n    From: phenom_investigator \n    To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n =\r\n   Sent: Thursday, May 28, 2009 10:04 AM\n    Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Tap sou=\r\nnd\n\n\n    What I have been hearing on this since the first posting is a sing=\r\nle\n    tap that sounds like wood on wood. Since the tapping was continual\n =\r\n   and you noticed an EM spike there is another possibility.\n\n    You could=\r\n have detected a PK event.

One of the environmental characteristics is\n    an elevated mag=\r\nnetic field. Often this is a geomagnetic field as seems\n    to be the case =\r\nin extreme poltergeist cases. Less extremem cases, \n    such as this may be=\r\n, we often see elevated EM field levels. Do your\n    readings in your notes=\r\n? Were you reading electrical or magnetic\n    fields?
