Hi All;
 I'm wondering why some many that do this "reseach" go mash potato=
es in the head, developing what seems to be that messiah complex. Box user =
after box user seems to go down this road. I don't know if it's just human =
ego, or they get possessed, or what. Maybe it's blinded by dollar signs!? M=
aybe it's like the Brookings Report, people just can not handle the truth o=
n a psychological/ego level. I think that report applies to all encounters =
with  the vastness of the universe. 
 
 I can't provide boxes for anyone el=
se until I figure this stuff out. It's not ethical to give people something=
 that has the potential of fucking them up, to be blunt. I wanted to give t=
hese boxes out to see how it worked for others, to see if they got somethin=
g like I did, and so far it's very disappointing. It's almost like an exper=
iment on people, except most were pretty much begging for, and demanding th=
e things. Even if it's not the boxes per se`, that's even more reason to av=
oid the situation.
