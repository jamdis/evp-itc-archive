I will upload some files. There \nhave been interesting sessions with how the Boxes address people by \nname. And now that it&#39;s happening to Steve it seems like this is part \nof the phenomena of the Box that is repeatable and observed by \nothers. -Bill\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Bill said something that had me thinking. He mentioned that when he \nfirst got his box it called Franks name repeatedly. That isnt the \nfirst time I saw someone say that. I know quite a few of you now have \nbeen given a box or even constructed your own versions like Steve \nbased on the work Frank did. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   I have heard a couple of peoples results here but I would like to \nhear more so I am going to ask if you have one you comment on your \nuse of it and how you think the results went as well as maybe post a \nfew sound files that I can hear. I have spent years listening to the \nbox voices but its refreshing to hear others results and see the \nvariations as with any other evp method, it differs by user/location. \nLOL you know who you are and I wont name you all but I do hope you \nwill share with us.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Thanks!\n&gt;   Misty\n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Be a better Heartthrob.
