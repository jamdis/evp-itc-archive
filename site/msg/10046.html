Does the old 12-469 make the clicking noise like the newer ones?

          I found an old 12-469 from RadioShack and compared to the newer one, the reception is real bad. I opened it up and noticed red, white, and black like screws. I decided to play around with them and noticed that it changed reception and how loud the stations come through. Has anyone else played with these? I'm trying to adjust them to get better reception, but can't quite get the reception the way I want it. Is there a way I can add a copper coil or anything to boost the reception? I attached some images for everyone to see. Any suggestions would be great.
