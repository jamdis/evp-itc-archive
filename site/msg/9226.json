I believe someone \n&gt; said the 12-820 arm band radio didnt click. Also I will need the \n&gt; instuctions on how to hack this one if anyone has it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am going to go to a couple of the older Radio shacks in my area and \n&gt; see if they have any of the older 469 and 470&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Kay\n&gt;"}
