Hi Draiga, Ursula, CB, and Rick, and all others interested in this topic:
=

As promised, I've attached a jpeg with the results of my camera experiment=
 using 1) digital point n' shoot camera, 2) Moditronics Deep IR camera, 3) =
Moditronics Full ( "Duo") Spectrum camera, and 4) a Nikon camera converted =
into a Full Spectrum camera.  I took these shots, one after the other, and =
from the same angle, in a purportedly haunted alley in San Francisco's Chin=
atown.  Please note that I took these photos during the day, which was one =
of the reasons I purchased the two Moditronics cameras - their cameras don'=
t see into the visible spectrum and thus prevent against visible light wash=
ing out any possible images that may be lurking in the IR and UV spectrums.=
  And, as you can see from the attached jpeg, in the fire escape one can se=
e what looks like a head floating in the two photos I took with Moditronics=
 Duo Spectrum and Deep IR cameras.  In the two photos taken with the regula=
r point n' shoot camera and the full spectrum camera, you can't see the flo=
ating head at all because the visible light washed it out.  Again, for nigh=
t time investigations, the drawback with the Moditronics cameras is that yo=
u will need some kind of external light source in order to see anything (or=
, you can always turn on some lights - if lights are available, why sit in =
the dark?)

Ursula, don't get me wrong, I think the SpecterCam 3 is a wonde=
rful full spectrum camera (as a matter of fact, I've just purchased one as =
a present to myself!).  I'm going to experiment with it and will probably b=
uy a filter for it that will block some of the visible light because, again=
, I don't want visible light possibly washing out the IR and UV spectrums, =
especially if I investigate during the day (I also investigate a lot of bat=
tlefields and many battlefields close early).

Apologies to the rest of you=
 who may be asking, what does this have to do with EVPs?  Well, photos of t=
rue anomalies can help substantiate any EVPs captured and, I might add here=
, the Moditronics camcorders also record sound (unlike DVR cameras, such as=
 Spectercams, where you would need to have a separate audio recorder if you=
 want sound to go with the images).  And yes, I have also picked up EVPs on=
 my camcorders. 

Finally, CB, I agree with you, the SVP cameras that Modit=
ronics use for their conversions are pretty flimsy in construction (plastic=
 casing).  I've accidentally banged my Deep IR camera against the gear shif=
t in the car and (Sob!) the bottom of the camera broke off from the tripod.=
  I duck-taped it back together and it still works, though (whew!).  (And y=
es, I, too, have noticed that the Ghost Hunters used the Moditronics full s=
pectrum camera on one of their shows this year.)

Therefore, Rick, don't sw=
eat it.  For what you get for the price, I think you did fine.  But like CB=
 said, don't drop these cameras or bang them around too much.

Lastly, I th=
ink all kinds and grades of cameras are worth experimenting with.  I've eve=
n captured a very interesting light anomaly with a cheap throwaway camera a=
nd have seen what appeared to be an apparition taken with a point n' shoot.=
  So, whatever one can afford, go with it!

Happy Holidays Everyone!
