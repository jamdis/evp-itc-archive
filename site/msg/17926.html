 Well, for me, I am satisfied, they do not need to prove anything more to m=
e, I have already received all the convincing I need, I spoke to my mother =
many times in spirit, hearing her voice, not to mention many other people I=
 know personally, I feel bad for folks who are so materialistic that they c=
annot see any further than the old brick wall surrounding them, even if one=
 should knock it down these type of people then question if they ever saw t=
he wall to begin with, their mind's are so closed, the hearts so hardened. =
My motto is something more like this statement, it's only with the heart th=
at one can see clearly, what's essential is invisible to the eye, no matter=
 what a person might demonstrate to such a skeptic would not convince them,=
 so it's best you live in your world, and I will stay in mine.=C2=A0 And to=
 each is own, sf ps. i like to use the colors because that's what they are =
there for. :)
