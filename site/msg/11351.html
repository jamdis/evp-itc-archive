<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have really been enjoying the posts in here. I have been doing 
investigations for over 20 + years, but always had an EVP tech, I am 
now trying it out for extended amount of time. I have not ever heard 
of this chip that I saw in the files, where and How do I build this? 

Frank, I have often read your experimentations with EVP, and I think 
your thoughts and experimentations are exellent. Do you have a parts 
list that would go with your plans so I may try to build one of 
these to experiment at locations?

Would love to interview you on Parahub Radio Frank. Email me@ 
investigations@lonestarspirits.org when you get a chance....
 
Thanks guys for the kick in the ass....

Ghostly Regards,
