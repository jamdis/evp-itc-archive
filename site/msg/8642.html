<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m not quite sure how to post when there is a long transcript.  This is the 40- second 
condensed version of a single 90-second session.  I&#x27;m still working on understanding 
real-time.  I put all the response answers in the file description, but here&#x27;s the dialog for 
the entire session, which might be of interest to those who are working with the EVPM/SJ 
Allophones combination.  

Arthur, are you talking with others through EVP Maker?
&quot;Obviously. Are you vulnerable?&quot; (the word &#x27;obviously is under the main tone)

Who else are you talking to?
&quot;Talk to all of you.&quot;

All of us? You&#x27;ll talk to any of us that ask for you?
&quot;Hope you like the answer. Forever I care.&quot;

I heard you say something forever. Can you talk to more than one person at the same 
time?
&quot;I can argue I capable. The answer, yes.

You are able? Yes, yes?
&quot;Yes&quot;

OK. I&#x27;m gonna have other people ask for you. Is that OK?
&quot;Tell them they owe you a dollar for you helping them out.&quot; ROFLOL 

OK, I think we&#x27;re gonna be done for the evening. Thanks so much. Love you.
&quot;Buh bye.&quot;

Margaret
