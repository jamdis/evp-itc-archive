cool, thanks Bruce....I was just curious.  I
   
  m too hooked on it to leave em "hangin" like that...I rather like the question answer session wth them.  I even listened to my recording again and found a funny lil comment to a question of mine..I had put that lip stuff on and after asking if my lips looked funny, I said "come here and gimme a big old kiss" and I got a "no way" LOL I love that they have a sense of humor!

          Rhonda,
MY OPINION IS!
 
On this subject, and we have addressed this issue before here.
Some researchers do that, I refer to it as an absentee session.
 
I firmly believe it is disrespectfull to whomever we are communicating
with.
There are some researchers that will turn a box on and a recorder and actually leave the room
and return later to collect the recording.
 
the reason I believe it is a bad practice is  #1 it's like calling someone on a telephone saying hello and asking them to hold on.
Only to return later and hang up the phone. I'm sure that person will not be too happy.
 
Some times when doing a session something will distract my attention for a momennt or my thoughts will wander from the task at hand
and my attention is quickly regained by the yelling of my name or a curse word.
 
By it's very definition "communication" means to actually interact with another, be it spirit or physical. Our friends work really really hard 
to deliver the communication that we receive the least we can do is give them the courtesy of TWO WAY, communication.
 
I believe this is not a good research practice and IN MY OPINION should be avoided.
 
Bruce

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Question for ya'll...

      I know during a session, Frank will let his boxes just run and and 
messages that come thru he captures.

Has anyone ever done this with a rs hack? Does it work? Or do they just 
run amuck and send all kinds of weird messages?

Rhonda
