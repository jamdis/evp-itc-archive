Heh yea I=
 remember chris fleming from the show Dead Famous. He also sells the K2 Met=
er on his site. I dont know why some people think its something that can es=
pecially enable one to contact the other side. Its an emf reader, Im not tr=
ying to be negative or anything. Im just pointing out its an EMF reader ins=
tead of having a digital/number indicator it uses lights. You can take a nu=
mbered EMF reader and accomplish communication that way also. All I am sayi=
ng is if you are the type who wants this but has to make a choice of having=
 money to eat for the next week or buy the meter, use what you have availab=
le to you. I have had successful two way communication using toys believe i=
t or not. Where you ask a question set toy off once for no twice for yes, a=
nd its worked. I think if there is someone willing enough on the other side=
 to speak to you, they are going to do it regardless of the device. If they=
 are intelligent enough theyll find a way to establish communication. Of co=
urse sometimes you can pick up stray voices where they may not trying to co=
mmunicate to you, you just capture it. So there are all kinds of communicat=
ion, well all know that. So no Im not saying the k2 is a rip off by no mean=
s, Im sure you can use it to establish communication, I have friends who ha=
ve the meter and swear by it. Im just saying if you have a regular numbered=
 EMF reader you can use that as well if you are needed the cash you have. R=
