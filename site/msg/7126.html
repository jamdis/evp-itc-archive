<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I started in EVP wiht white, then various other noise methods, and 
eventuallly found EVPmaker on the web. Evepmaker worked reallly well 
fro me, but i kept getting messages realyed from spirits that 
couldn&#x27;t use the computer, by the ones that could. I was ewondering 
what else I could use, and after aobut a week, the whole copncept of 
the box kinda popped int my head fully formed. I think it was my own 
subconcious mind that assembeld information from past experience, and 
presented it as a solutuion to the problem. I had worked wijht these 
radio modules from car stereos a few years previous, and knew they 
cold be voltage tuned, so I come up wiht an analog version of 
EVPmaker, pretty much.

&gt; Frank,
&gt; 
&gt; To start off with no I do not want a box. =) 
&gt; 
&gt; However, I do have a question for you when you have time.  I was 
just
&gt; curious as to where you got the inspiration for the box. 
&gt; 
&gt; Was it just an idea that popped into your head or did you have help
&gt; from the other side?  Not to take any credit away from you at all 
with
&gt; your accomplishments with the box. It was just something I was 
curious
&gt; about.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe I am looking for personal answers from the other side but
&gt; also I feel it may help me with some more general directions I may
&gt; want to go in after putting my own personal demons to rest. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your time in advance.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; TT
