&gt;  I&#x27;m only deleting stuff that is old, 2008 and older, and leaving any text files, like someone&#x27;s instructions.

&gt; &gt; I deleted as many files as I could from 2006, 2007, and 2008. Yahoo errored out on me, so I&#x27;ll have to continue later. The files sapce has to be temporary only, you can&#x27;t just dump files and leave them--for years.
