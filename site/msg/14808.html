<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>here was some replys from my team member who considers himself our de-bunker:

The one pertaining to &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t kill&quot; here was his reply:

&quot;doesnt sound like &quot;he wouldn&#x27;t kill&quot; sounds like &quot; he wont show ?(her) it was cut off.
anyway why would we call this an evp?&quot;

This was his response to the one where we asked what happened when they tried to escape and got the response &quot;da pit&quot;

He says:&quot;this one sound like a sports radio frequency &quot;the Pitt&quot; sburgh Penquins. I hear do &quot;back off&quot;.
example of just radio chatter scanning, to me. would you submit as evidence?&quot;

The one where we asked about how to get thru the steel bars and wood and we get the &quot;Take ur file&quot; as a response, my team member who isn&#x27;t buying any of this replys:
&quot;I slowed end down sounds like &quot;take your final&quot; or &quot;findings could be talking college radio, who knows, its radio frequencies&quot;

by the way after i slowed the same file down i noticed it comes thru between 6-8 different clicks on 12-469 radio on the am channel.  AS we all know that would equal about 6-8 different channels.  what is the chances of getting an understandable phrase in the same tone of voice across that many channels... i should pose that response back to him and see what his de-bunking result would be?


I guess he&#x27;s intitled to his own opinion, i am just gonna ignore his responses and keep doing what i am doing.  Thanks for the support and knowledge!
