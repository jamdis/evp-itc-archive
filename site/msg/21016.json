Maybe, it&#39;s only your clips that i can&#39;t hear.  Could be &quot;they&quot; block my hearing when it comes to your files as a etheral joke.\n\n-Steve\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s a few more, on that one part where they talk about Jerusalem, they  \n&gt; are referring to the &quot;coffins being those in hell&quot;  buried in the way of  \n&gt; the doors of the old city where JC is going to open the doors, he would need \n&gt; to  raise the dead there first in order to pass through into Old Jerusalem.   \n&gt; It&#39;s an old saying, the Messiah cannot pass the dead in the valley between \n&gt; MT of  olives and the city wall until the dead are raised.  Most of these \n&gt; are  reverse type files too, I didn&#39;t have time to revere them, they have \n&gt; words in  sentences, on each side.  Most of the spirit&#39;s are talking to each \n&gt; other,  it seems they think you are ignoring them, they are saying that you \n&gt; won&#39;t talk  to them, and some are upset with you.\n&gt;"}
