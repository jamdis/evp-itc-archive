<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Steve,

I certainly respect and support the idea that none of us is a messiah
and none of us has all the answers, but that is not germane to the
issue here. This is about how to correctly and fairly moderate a list.

If this was the wild west, things would have transpired something like
this:

Bruce stood in the public street and offered a completely legitimate
exchange with the townsfolk.

Laura walked out of the saloon and took a shot at Bruce and at the
window of Frank S&#x27;s telegraph office.

Bruce shot back at Laura.

Johnny Marlboro stepped out onto the balcony of the Imperial hotel and
took a shot a Bruce.

Bruce shot back.

Laura pulled out a deputy&#x27;s badge, stuck it to her lapel, and shot
Bruce dead.

Ann ran out into the street and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t you think there&#x27;s a
problem here? Maybe the sheriff needs to step in,&quot; to which Laura,
acting under the color of law, replied that if Ann didn&#x27;t like it she
could leave town and if she stayed she better not question authority
again. 

That&#x27;s what happened here. That&#x27;s the issue.

I&#x27;m still standing here saying something is wrong. Shoot me.

Ann

&gt; I understand where you are coming from in respect in speaking their 
&gt; opinion, however if i had to read yet another post of how great 
&gt; someone is when nobody is great in this i was going to be sick.  
&gt; Arrogance and ego is very bad and that kind of mentality is Cancer to 
&gt; this research, i can share my opinion with the group but never tell 
&gt; anybody what to do.  I sit idly by and watch 200+ people get bad 
&gt; information on a daily basis, which hurts any good research.  The 
&gt; best way to go about what we are doing is to come up with our own 
&gt; theories and post them as examples for others to read.  We shouldn&#x27;t 
&gt; have anybody dictate every aspect of this as fact.  If anybody can 
&gt; give information on box use it would be Frank, who nobody who owns 
&gt; boxes has listened to...myself included.  He knows how they work and 
&gt; offers a great amount of knowledge to this subject or else none of us 
&gt; would even be here.  This board has started to be a dictatorship of 
&gt; one persons opinion and if nobody listened...they were wrong.  And to 
&gt; me, that&#x27;s wrong.  I started out with Joe&#x27;s box and moved forward and 
&gt; nobody helped me in my path.  I since aquired other boxes and taught 
&gt; myself them as well, which means it can be done.  People...do your 
&gt; own thing and get results the best way you can and learn from your 
&gt; mistakes, that&#x27;s what i did.  And getting Bruce his first Joe&#x27;s box 
&gt; and Frank&#x27;s box and getting him started in box research, i somewhat 
&gt; feel responsible for what transpired on this board and i apologize to 
&gt; those involved.  Frank, i&#x27;m sorry that another person has taken your 
&gt; box and claimed to know all and not listening to what you adhere we 
&gt; do.
&gt; 
&gt; Nuff Said,

&gt; &gt; With all due respect, I am going to put my 2 bits in on this.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I love the sharing of info, but have elected to post less and 
&gt; retire 
&gt; &gt; to reading more. :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That said, I must agree with Ann that the initial post, though 
&gt; &gt; perhaps posted to be humorous, came off as disrespectful (in my 
&gt; &gt; opinion as a reader looking in on this forum) not only to BH but to 
&gt; &gt; FS.  BH does get animated at times, but he also brings some good 
&gt; &gt; input in here, too. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We need to learn how to get along and work together.  Look at your 
&gt; &gt; initial post from someone else&#x27;s point of view and unban the poor 
&gt; &gt; fella&#x27;, won&#x27;t ya&#x27;?  ;)

&gt; &gt; &gt; I brought up a point in a lighthearted way, and it was NOT

&gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; being abusive and attacking and degrading ones character is a 
&gt; &gt; totally
&gt; &gt; &gt; different scenario. There are 3 Mod&#x27;s on the board, and we

&gt; &gt; &gt; choices are made. I am sorry if you are feeling conflict with is

&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; before you open your mouth read the post that this post was in 
&gt; &gt; reply too.
&gt; &gt; &gt; who are you to suggest anything, when was the last time anybody
&gt; &gt; &gt; saw any research or files from you? OOPS I forget nobody EVER did.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; Stop sticking your mouth where it does not belong.

&gt; &gt; &gt; DON&quot;T BE HATIN!!
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; First off the reason I got a new box From Frank is because he 
&gt; &gt; recognises
&gt; &gt; &gt; that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am a serious researcher, It does not have anything to do with 
&gt; &gt; being a man 
&gt; &gt; &gt; or woman. It has to do with being deserving of a Frank&#x27;s box and 
&gt; &gt; evidently!
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well do I have to spell it out? Start putting some time into your 
&gt; &gt; research
&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of
&gt; &gt; &gt; taking tantrums and maybe someday you&#x27;ll have a Frank&#x27;s box, But 
&gt; I 
&gt; &gt; doubt it!
