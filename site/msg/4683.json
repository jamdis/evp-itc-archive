I said there are hundreds of examples on line\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; known long exposures. When even a few of these are compared with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Luminator examples, I see a tremendous similarity. Do you?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but there are a couple of dozen in Macy&#39;s book, &quot;Spirit \nFaces,&quot;\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yes, many many of them are open to wide interpretation,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Does that mean that you agree with my point? Because, as I \nreason\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it, they are either spirit extras or they aren&#39;t. They can&#39;t \nsort-\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be spirit extras. I&#39;m not sure what other interpretations there\n&gt; &gt; might\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be in this instance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just as our humble recordings are.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In addition to that majority that make us say, &quot;Come on!{&quot;\n&gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are a handful that make you say &quot;Hmmmmmmm. . . .&quot; Just like we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offer a handful of results from our endless recording efforts \nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try to convince the hard-nosed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;d agree with you wholeheartedly, if I had ever seen one that\n&gt; &gt; did,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in fact, make me go, &quot;Hmmmm.&quot; As I said, I have never seen one\n&gt; &gt; where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the sitter and the extra did not share a consistent set of\n&gt; &gt; features\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and coloring. If you have any examples that do, and you can \nshare\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them, I&#39;d be delighted to see them. I&#39;d like my opinion to be\n&gt; &gt; swayed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Really, I would.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would think that many would see the Luminator efforts as a\n&gt; &gt; modern\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effort at scrying.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you mean scrying as in the psychomanteum method developed by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Raymond Moody? My understanding, from attending a presentation \nby\n&gt; &gt; Dr.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moody, was that the psychomanteum produced full-blown \napparitions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that could converse with the bereaved. Not sure these two types \nof\n&gt; &gt; &gt; events are comparable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Everything we do crosses boundaries, and my point is that it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really hard to walk the line between trying to be scientific \nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to be open. It&#39;s really, really hard! But if we give in\n&gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; area, we have to be willing to give in another.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think that is arguably true, Ursula. If the evidence\n&gt; &gt; appears\n&gt; &gt; &gt; good, I acknowledge it; if the evidence appears weak, I\n&gt; &gt; acknowledge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it. It is simply not true to say that a person cannot be both \nopen-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; minded and scientific. I really do want to believe, but I won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; believe just because I want to. And because you, me, or anyone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;gives&quot; in one area, does not make a phenomenon any more or less\n&gt; &gt; real.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your fellow traveler on this journey,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ursula\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lisby &lt;lisby@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a classic example of the kind of photo that Mark \nthinks\n&gt; &gt; shows\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a spirit extra. To me, clearly, this is the same woman--same \nhair,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same eyes, same mouth, same nose. Again, to me, it looks like \na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; classic long exposure when compared with other known long\n&gt; &gt; exposures--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve included just of hundreds of examples.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
