Thanks all for getting back so quickly.  It probably makes me feel a bit better if nothing is on the recording since I don't seem to pick anything up anyway.  The "Ask Bruce is a bit of surprise only because I already did ask bruce.  He had suggested I try a direct recording.  
   
  This actually brings up a question about what Steve hears.  Is it possible that you are getting a message given to you at the time you are listening to my recording which actually does not have the message?  I must say I am still overwhelmed from getting messages on the other evp maker recording (that others hear).   My pea brain and body are still processing that information.
