Computer speakers work fine.  I use a small speaker\nbuilt for mp3 players that I picked up at Big Lots for $6.\n2.\tYou need something to record the sessions into.  Some people use\ndigital recorders.  I record mine directly into my computer using a\nfreeware program called Audacity.  http://audacity.sourceforge.net/\nvia headphones that have a built in microphone\n3.\tI don&#39;t have access to Audacity at the moment, but I think it&#39;s\npretty self explanatory.  If you need further instructions on this,\nI&#39;ll look at the process when I get home.\n4.\tTo do a session, set the Audacity to record.  Turn on your hack and\npress the top part of the button on the front until it starts flipping\nthrough the stations continuously.  You can let it go after that.\nHold the speaker a few inches from the microphone.  You can either ask\nquestions or allow the box to run on its own.  When you are finished,\nreview the recording to see if you pick up any communications through\nit.\n\n\nI hope that makes sense.\n\n\nNellie"}
