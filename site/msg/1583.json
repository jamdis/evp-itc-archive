Some dont log into the group they just read it by email. For those of you that want ALL the files, you must set your group settings to individual emails.\n   \n  That should send every persons post to you via the email address you used for signup. These emails will have the files attached to them. And yes you will suddenly get alot more email than usual so dont let it shock you. Most email shows whether files have attachments or not as well as subject lines so its very easy to browse and see what you want to review.\n   \n  For those who dont want all of the files or all the individual emails, just pick special notices or no email and you can read or post on the group site. You will not recieve file attachments.\n   \n  I had 49 emails just since I was at work (thanks guys LOL) but I have already sifted thru them in about 15 minutes so its not a big deal for me. \n   \n  This group is about researching and for those who want to be left out of the loop.... or not partake in our discussions I often wonder why they wanted to join in the first place. Anyone can read posts freely without joining...at least for now. We need more communication on this side I think than with &quot;them&quot;. What good is research if nobody knows about it or learns from it....right?\n   \n  So remember to share, listen, speak, ask questions, answer questions, and above all learn. Lessons are all around us. Keep it going you guys are great =) Look around you, lots of great members here. Get to know each other a bit better and feel free to message me on yahoo.
