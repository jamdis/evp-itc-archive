Well I was simplifying but most broadcast antennas are setup for very littl=
e radiation directly below as well as above as it is a waste of power.=A0 A=
M *loves* to shoot straight up because of the bounce (as you HAM guys know)=
 but TV and FM wants as much power as possible to be at the top for the far=
thest line of sight broadcast.

I was amazed to read that you guys got FM c=
hatter on the recorder.=A0 I guess it is possible in theory but I would nev=
er had expected that.=A0 Just goes to show why it is all radio theory and n=
ot radio proof or law :))=A0 Those EM fields are tricky little buggers.

That's only true of a simple di=
pole.  Antennas can be engineered to get 

practically any pattern you want=
. In fact, many FM and TV antennas have a 

pattern which peaks from direct=
ly below the antenna to the horizon and 

sends very little signal straight=
 up.



Also, close-in you might still be in the Fresnel zone of the field.=
