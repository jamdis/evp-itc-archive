We are energy they are energy everything in this world is energy, we just need to learn to harness it and use it to get what we want.  look around your home.  do you see horizontal lights? do you see orbs? if not thats okay, it will happen as you learn to notice things that you&#39;ve been too busy to see.\n   \n    ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Amy Swanson \n  To: evp-itc@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, June 13, 2006 3:35 PM\n  Subject: [EVP-ITC] evp\n  \n\n      well if yall are very expiereinced in this, i just started doing evp&#39;s a few weeks ago!\n  I know that these folks have been around me and some are where i live. the first time i did an evp i got nothing till the 3rd time. Then its seems that it opened a door for them, they are conversing amongst themselves saying hello to each other, that they can see, they can see the computer, one of them said he was beseiged. I didnt record again till yesterday, and i kinda wonder if they are mad? i kept getting vibes to record but have been to tired with moving. Can they get mad with you? i assume they can. When i recorded, i have been using microsoft word and typing my questions, and a little bit of talking too, if they can see the computer &lt;so they said&gt; why not?! I also used this thing from EVP maker that shows pictures and makes clicks and tones. The only thing they had to say was &quot;watch&quot; watch&quot;, wether they ment to not say anything and just watch m e or refering to some of the questions i had, i dont know, cant assume anything lol. What can i do to get them to talk to\n me more? Answer questions? like no one has indentified themselves and i would really like to know who they are. I have a few people i would like to talk to that have passed over. However anyone is nice lol. I just would like to open this door MORE now, that i have closed off. I think that I opened a doorway for them but i want to interact more! People have been refering to me as a &quot;sensitive&quot;? I assume meaning that i am able to tell if they are here etc. Which i usually can. Is it possible that because in the past for the most part i have kept this part of me closed off, except those entities that refuse to be silenced come through, that they are skeptical of talking to me? That i cant handle it?\n   \n  Anyway, justthought id talk with somemore people who have &quot;been there done that&quot;\n  I would like to have someone over who has alot of history and do an evp in my home and talk to them for me. &lt;sigs&gt;\n   \n  Amy\n   \n\n\n  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/\n   \n  LON3_S7AR  YAHOO MESENGER ID\n  __________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
