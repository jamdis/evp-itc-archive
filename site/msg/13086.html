Tom, 
=A0
I own a Motorola Razor. On a recent investigation I had my Razor =
set to vibrate. I recieved a phone call that set off the EMF detector and i=
t subsequently "spiked" from the color green to red and did so for each vib=
ra signal the the phone was receiving... This false positive reading led me=
 to make sure that everyones phone was instead turned off entirely.
=A0
I h=
ave also recieved radio interference or bleed over from other two-way radio=
s in the area that can be confused as EVP if not mentioned when recording a=
udio. Still, I find 2-way radios convenient if not necessary for larger sca=
le field investigations. I'm sure my colleagues in the Gettysburg area woul=
d agree with me ... but I also hear from my friend Bill Murphy that many ha=
ve resorted to hand held GPS systems to mark particular areas of interest w=
hen conducting EVP or ITC sessions in the field...
=A0

That's interesting Laurie. How have you seen radio=
s like that messing
up equipment? What equipment do you think is susceptibl=
e to that kind
of radio interference?
