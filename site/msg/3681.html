 Well, I can tell where that theory came from! It's been my experience, th=
ey use what we use, as long as it's something they can form voices out of. =
It's also been my experience that the combo noise/frag voice is what our ow=
n minds create. I suggest you play with EVPmaker, with clear raw audio, you=
'll find no white noise needed. 
 
 I don't get any mention of technicians,=
 or anykind of helper/operators on the other side. They sometimes talk abou=
t a network, but I couldn't tell you what that is, or if it's real. 
 
 I t=
hink it's 99.99%PK. So not only do spirits, and other entities make voices,=
 we can do it to, mostly unconciuosly. 
 
 Moon is still certain that it ha=
s to be random, despite the last several months of experiments that show th=
e linear mode is far superior. 
 
 If someone could take a digital speech r=
ecordng, stored in memory, and chop it up, and play it back over a speaker,=
 I think it would work just as well as radio. You could get live voices, an=
swers to questions, and never replace the raw audio. This is in fact EVPmak=
er, but it would be nice to have it portable. EVPmaker pretty much took all=
 the mystery out of this, and it's all but igonred. My system, and analog v=
ersion of EVPmaker using technologies I had worked wiht in the past. My min=
d did kind of assemble all the elements, so I got an image of the complete =
system. 
 
 I thought I knew how the voices in my boxes worked at one time.=
.now I have no idea!

Some new additions for the 12-470... I hope




Excuse me if I mispell some=
 things in this post, I'm currently running the production board for a LIVE=
 internet radion program going on right now, and I'm doing 100 things at on=
ce!Okay... According to some, "...the Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides =
on the other side have repeatedly explained that the way that the Telephone=
 to the Dead technology works, is by spirit energy manipulating the random =
voltage generator (RVG) and using white and pink noise, as well as radio fr=
agment, to create real time voice answers to questions posed from our side.=
 The most important aspect to this device is the medium operator who works =
as an antenna or "interpreter" for living individuals asking the questions.=
"So, that said (or copied and pasted) I have decided that my next attempt w=
ith the older version of the 12-470 will be the following:1) Add a method o=
f variable voltage used to adjust the tuning circuit, similar to the RVG me=
ntioned above. I went out and purchased another older 12-470 today, to do j=
ust this.(Frank... I did some measurements of that VT and found a range to =
work with.. I hope!)2) Add that white or pink noise to be mixed with the sw=
eeping raw audio already available from the modified 12-470.3) Add an inter=
nal antenna for the 12-470.4) Add an interface so the user will be a active=
/passive part of the radio. As mentioned above, as the antenna between the =
entities/spirits.So... if I can accomplish all that... maybe the little ole=
