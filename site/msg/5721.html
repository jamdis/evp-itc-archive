<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, that&#x27;s my appraoch, I refuse to be run off by something 
cussing at me. But I have to wonder if there&#x27;s stuff people can&#x27;t 
handle. Personally I never have encountered anything harmful, only 
marginally menacing, but that&#x27;s just me.

&gt; Fantastic comment you made: &quot;It&#x27;s just something that doesn&#x27;t want 
&gt; you to wake up.&quot;  That is right on in my opinion...if they can 
create 
&gt; fear in a person, then they can manipulate that person.  Fear is 
the 
&gt; doorway to losing power and control.  
&gt; 
&gt; Think about the playground bully who takes people&#x27;s lunch money 
until 
&gt; a kid half his size calls his bluff by smacking him in the mouth. ;)

&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Robin,
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; It&#x27;s never a good idea to invite any spirits into your home.
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Some demonic spirits have to be invited in before they can 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; enter, there are instinces where people have heard knocks 
on 
&gt; &gt; thier
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; front door only to answer the door and have no one there.
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; The knocking by an entity and the opening by the physical 
&gt; being 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; symbolises the request to come in and the invitation of the 
&gt; &gt; open 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   door.
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; If you give out a ready made invitation, it could be like 
&gt; that 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   annoying
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; relative that comes to visit and never leaves.
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; So be very careful whenever summoning any unknown entities.
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; If you need help with your box research or have any 
questions
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; don&#x27;t hesitate.

&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Yes Bruce, &quot;We want to kill you&quot; is word for word what I 
&gt; hear. 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Thank you for being the first person ever to validate this 
for 
&gt; &gt; me, 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   because now I know it&#x27;s REAL, I&#x27;m not crazy, and it isn&#x27;t my 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   imagination. This was captured on a digital voice recorder 
&gt; while 
&gt; &gt; I 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   was heating coffee in the microwave oven nearby, and I felt 
&gt; that 
&gt; &gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   microwave must have been a powerful energy source for 
&gt; &gt; the &quot;speaker.&quot; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   It may be important to note that I had just invited spirits 
&gt; &gt; inside 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   the house from outside, and that after I listened to this 
&gt; message 
&gt; &gt; I 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   told them to go back outside because they were too rude to 
&gt; &gt; continue 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   talking to. I&#x27;ve tried to replicate this experiment a number 
of 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   times since then (without the verbal invitation into my home) 
&gt; and 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   have had no luck whatsoever. 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Gleefully moving on to box research!

&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Robin, In the evp file you posted I believe I&#x27;m hearing &quot;we 
&gt; &gt; want to 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   kill you&quot;please let me know if that is what you hear. Robin, 
I 
&gt; am 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   glad to hear that the protection ritual will be utilized by 
you 
&gt; &gt; in 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   the purpose it was intended. To give any individual that 
wants 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   anopportunity to use it. You will find many forms of 
&gt; interaction 
&gt; &gt; on 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   this group, running the gamut from total agreement to calm 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   debate /discussion. To full blown arguments. That is what 
makes 
&gt; a 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   group, If everyone followed one single ideology and the ideas 
&gt; of 
&gt; &gt; any 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   single person without questionit would not be a group it 
would 
&gt; be 
&gt; &gt; a 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   cult. Welcome to the wonderful world of box research robin, 
I&#x27;m 
&gt; &gt; sure 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   you will be a valued member and researcher in this community.

&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; I&#x27;m still giving this topic a lot of thought because I 
&gt; &gt; absolutely 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   believe in the power of prayer, the power of positivity, and 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   power of ritual. When I first started recording EVP a couple 
of 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   years ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when 
it 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   happened to me I felt elated rather than frightened or 
&gt; &gt; distressed. I 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   will ask again: What physical or psychic harm is a 
disembodied 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   entity capable of doing? Please listen to the one EVP I&#x27;ve 
&gt; posted 
&gt; &gt; on 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   this board and tell me what, if anything, you hear. I know 
what 
&gt; I 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   hear, and I consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   response that has created the determination in me to continue 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   researching the unknown. 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings. I only want to learn 
&gt; as 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   much as I can from you and the other dedicated researchers on 
&gt; &gt; this 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   board. It never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   past, and that&#x27;s about all I can say. I will probably use one 
&gt; &gt; from 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   this point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   goodness. 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; So, thank you for this contribution. I think the debate has 
&gt; &gt; been 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   an excellent one, and I&#x27;ve appreciated the opportunity to be 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   enlightened.

&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; I swore I would not get wraped up in this debateBUT!The 
&gt; reason 
&gt; &gt; I 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   came up with this whole protection ritual was that some of 
the 
&gt; &gt; new 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   researchers whereexpressing a rational concern for negative 
&gt; &gt; responces 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   that they were recieving through thier boxes.The short 
&gt; protection 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   ritual that I posted is not meant to quell irrational 
&gt; histerical 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   fear, and I agreewith rosemary that anyone suffering from 
such 
&gt; &gt; fear 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   should rethink thier involment in the paranormal research 
&gt; &gt; field.that 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   being said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal 
comfort 
&gt; &gt; to 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   those new individuals that had never expperienced spiritual 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   negativity. And to help ease them into aproaching a session 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   eventually with confidenceand determination as well as full 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   curiousity for all types of the communication we recieve.My 
&gt; &gt; initial 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   post of the ritual file was done with the best of intentions 
&gt; and 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   meant to be another tool available for those who felt they 
&gt; needed 
&gt; &gt; or 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer ritual, I 
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   think it is really worthy of all this debate.Use it, don&#x27;t 
use 
&gt; &gt; it. 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   It&#x27;s there if you want it. Also I must say there are two 
kinds 
&gt; of 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   fear the kind that is natural and a god given emotion for 
self 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   preservation, ie the fright and flight reflex that is an 
&gt; &gt; instinctive 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   trait in all of us. Then you have the irrational dibilitating 
&gt; &gt; phobic 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   fear that can turn an individual into a frozen statue. That 
&gt; type 
&gt; &gt; of 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   fear I believe is unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt 
&gt; with 
&gt; &gt; and 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   learned how to harness. I also believe that anyone that 
harbors 
&gt; &gt; that 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   type of fear would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and 
in 
&gt; a 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   case of such fear it would already be present and doing a 
small 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   protection ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take 
&gt; it 
&gt; &gt; for 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   what it is, something to utilize in our box of tools like an 
&gt; emf 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   meter.you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the 
bottom 
&gt; of 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   your tool box at home that you inherited from your 
grandfather 
&gt; &gt; and 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   have never usedbut if you come across that odd nut that needs 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   tightening somedsy you will be glad you have it.Bruce
