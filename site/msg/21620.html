<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ok, after backing up, and searching posts from days ago.....I don&#x27;t want to offend anyone with different ideas. 

 Yeah, I try various methods from time to time, I prefer methods that provide a form of raw audio,sound that has elements of human speech. Suych as the Ghost boxes, a radio tuned between stations, crowd noise, and EVPmaker. I know what the critics say--imagination, aka matrixing, and they are pretty much wrong. I&#x27;ve been doing this stuff for more than tens years, and I get enough that others can hear to show there is alot going on. It&#x27;s not just some half alive zombie ghost trying to talk, these entities tend to be more aware and more alive than any of us, and ever present as I&#x27;m testing/recording. 

 Maybe you are asking if anyone uses reel to reel recorders? Probably won&#x27;t find one the works, but I prefer cassette tape, but also use digital recorders and the video function of the cell phone. 

 There seems to be a connection between EVP and solar activity, just as with radio, there seems to be propagation effects with EVP, especially while uisng &quot;raw audio&quot; based methods, and communications are beginning to pick up with increased solar activity. Extra class ham operator BTW.

 There has been advancements, and I think you need to do afew more web searches, and reading before you say no one is doing anything of value.

&gt; Hi
&gt; Great group you have here..so many posts..I have been on the fringe of
&gt; evp off and on for years and decided to get into it again.I purchased
&gt; &quot;voices of eternity &quot; by Sarah Estep.Great book.I really like the
&gt; quality of the evp that Sarah used to get on her reel to reel and was
&gt; wondering if anyone still uses that technology for evp work.
&gt; thanks
