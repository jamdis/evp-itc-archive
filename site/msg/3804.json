How much time \ndid you spend replying to join in the arguments you feel do involve \nYOU?&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The point being, this is a research group for ITC not a \nboxing room and definitely your own personal battlegrounds. Take that \nelsewhere. Healthy discussion is one thing but I have seen very few \npeople offering that. In fact I know a few of you joined here just to \ngo after someone who ticked you off.

I personally know Chris and \nthink he&#39;s a great guy and frank feels the same way most days. This \nhas gotten to the point where i can&#39;t even do a session anymore \nbecause i&#39;m so blocked by negative thoughts from this group it&#39;s \npointless to concentrate on the box and get results. Honestly who \ncares what chris does anyway, does it really affect everyone&#39;s lives \nthat much. I have a job and this is a hobby that i used to really \nlike, but now this board has brought me down. It seems all people \nwant to do is make this like a street fight with challenges and \nnegative views and for what reason? If anyone is concerned about \nhearing Chris&#39;s audio, i have about 2 hours of box sessions from \nEastern State on my web site for all to listen to. It&#39;s \nwww.keyportparanormal.com and go to investigation and click on \neastern state. All the audio is at the bottom of that page and you \nguys can judge for yourself and i heard a lot come out of that box \nthat night personally because i repeated a lot of stuff back to chris \nthat i heard. Enough already, let&#39;s move on to the next great thing. \nThat radio shack hack was a great breakthrough here, let&#39;s just be \nhappy we got that before it was shut down. Now we have another avenue \nto go down, but we can&#39;t do it with all these negatives out there. \nLet&#39;s move on to new topics and anyone out there that bought a Radio \nShack box, start sharing your files with the group so it&#39;s not just \nus same 5 that post all the time.-Steve H.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Be a better sports \nnut!
