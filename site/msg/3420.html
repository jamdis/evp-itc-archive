Misty,
 
I listened to all the rachel clips , sorry I did not hear any of t=
hem.
 
maybe they are meant for your ears only. IMHO the files are way over=
 filtered and alot of the voice sylables
and nuances have been removed. You=
 can tell there is definately someone talking only the files are so over pr=
ocessed
you can not make out the words.

osted a bit of the Rachel collection for all.





As most of you know by n=
ow as a child I grew up hearing constant chatter nightly from a man and a w=
oman. Thier voices always sounded like a tv playing in the other room but t=
here would be no television on and no man and woman visible.
 
When I moved=
 some of the strangeness followed tho I never heard her voice again until I=
 returned to that old house. Once I left again I didnt hear it again until =
I happened to start capturing thier speech in evp research. Once I realized=
 I was able to do this and pump up the volume, replay etcetera her voice re=
turned. Only this time I often hear her clearly thanks to technology being =
what it is.
 
For the longest time I had no clue who she was just that now =
and then I would hear "that womans" voice pop up in my evp. Also when I sta=
rted doing this research many spirits spoke of a woman named Rachel. Visiti=
ng Rachel's house, talking about her like she was an angel or a guide or ev=
en thier grandmother. One day i decided to ask a simple question. What was =
the name of the woman who was speaking, and the reply I got quite stunned m=
e. It was "her" voice saying the name Rachel. In some weird way it made som=
e sort of crazy sense. All this time this spirit has been around me and I d=
ont have the foggiest idea who she is just that for some reason she has an =
interest in hanging around me for over 30 years now. I never saw her as a n=
egative just slightly annoying and maybe a bit spooky as a kid hehehe
 
On =
one hand it was quite disturbing growing up with that...on the other its qu=
ite comforting to me now to have placed some details on that "figment of my=
 imagination" I was forced to live with. Shined a bit of light on the subje=
ct for me quite literally. 
 
Anyways a short while back it occurred to me =
that I should start collecting her files together in one collection so I st=
arted to do that. When I run across them in my archives I copy them over or=
 when I record a new one I will copy it over. I plan to do the same for Ott=
o...he has quite a number of files tho he rarely speaks the others are alwa=
ys quick to fill in details of what hes doing. 
 
Anyway check it out when =
you get a chance. I think if you can hear the evp at all that in quite a fe=
w you may hear the similarity in her voice, her way of speaking, and her to=
ne. I dont expect you to hear all of it but I think most will hear quite a =
few of them.
 
Enjoy
