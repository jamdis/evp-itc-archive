This is cute, like a \nboxful of confetti or gummi worms.  Good luck with it Mike!  BTW, I \ngot the radio from you hacked last night and it actually WORKS!!  I&#39;m \non the road and will try it out in the motel tonight.

I think it was because \nsome \n&gt;   of you guys were talking about echo chambers.\n&gt;   Anyway... when I woke up I went looking around the house for \nstuff to \n&gt;   make this thing before I forgot what it looked like in my dream.\n&gt;   I completed it but now I guess I must test it to see if it is \nwhat I \n&gt;   think it is... an EVP Box, maybe???\n&gt; \n&gt;   Read more and see a few pictures, here: http://www.ufogeek.com/?\np=200&lt;http://www.ufogeek.com/?p=200&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;   - Mike\n&gt;"}
