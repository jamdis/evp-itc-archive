<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Keith at ITC Bridge sent a memo stating Debbie Caruso passed last night. Some of you may know of Debbie&#x27;s work through the AA-EVP or her many tv appearances, or perhaps her website http://www.1800heaven.com/aboutme.htm

I met her at the 2006 AA-EVP Atlanta conference and witnessed how she could easily record and playback evps right on the spot for people that were curious about evps. She was one of the 1st people that I met that seemed to be an evp magnet. She made a real contribution to the field and her work will always be appreciated.
