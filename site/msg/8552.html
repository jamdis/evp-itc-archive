<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Stefan and Steve.  The closest thing I&#x27;ve gotten to an answer from &quot;Arthur&quot; about how 
this is working is the words &#x27;air&#x27; or &#x27;air-to-air.&#x27;  This makes little sense to me, unless there 
is some type of additional manipulation taking place acoustically, because I am not 
recording in a closed environment.  I am playing the file from EVP Maker using an external 
speaker and recording using the built-in mic of my MAC. 

I have no idea, what, if any difference this might make in terms of opportunity for &#x27;them&#x27; to 
speak intelligent phrases.  Just thought I&#x27;d share what I&#x27;m hearing.  I&#x27;ll keep asking, and 
trying to get a clearer explanation of the process (though I&#x27;ve never had much luck with 
that in the past, in regard to getting explanations for the mechanics of any other 
technique!)

&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The inputed file is just tones, how are they creating words and
&gt; &gt; sentences?  Does anybody have a logical explanation yet?  Energy 
&gt; &gt; fields, Conincidence...etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, there are a lot of explanations for this, but none of them has
&gt; been proven yet (afaik). I tend to the &quot;synchronicity&quot; explanation - at
&gt; least when pure logical devices such as computers are used, which I
&gt; believe can&#x27;t be influenced mentally, neither by spirits nor by humans
&gt; (otherwise they would probably crash more often than already without
&gt; such a manipulation). ;)
&gt; 
&gt; I think that causal models aren&#x27;t sufficient to explain EVP. If no
&gt; devices are influenced directly, there must be taking place some other
&gt; form of &quot;manipulation&quot;. Perhaps the &quot;probability field&quot; is manipulated
&gt; somehow in cases where random number generators (RNG) are involved? As
&gt; we know from psychokinesis experiments in parapsychological labs, test
&gt; persons were able to get &quot;hits&quot; even when &quot;prerecorded targets&quot; are used
&gt; instead of a RNG. It seems that time and causality doesn&#x27;t matter in
&gt; respect to paranormal phenomena.
