&gt; Yeah, I think a lot of pretenders do try to find ways to promote themselves
&gt; into more credibility.  In fact, I wonder about that project you are going
&gt; to be doing with Mr Moon.  It&#x27;s my guess he is the one who suggested it
&gt; (maybe even dropped some profitability hints?).  Realize, his method of
&gt; performing medium with the box, and charging the vulnerable large amounts of
&gt; money, is under attack from many quarters, and he has begun to go on the
&gt; defensive.  One thing that is hard for him to defend, is how he can be so
&gt; expert with the box when he had nothing to do with its construction.
&gt;
&gt; Now consider, if he can get the box&#x27;s maker to participate in a project
&gt; together, even just once, he can add to his list of credentials things such
&gt; as &quot;Worked together with the original box&#x27;s designer, Frank Sumption, on new
&gt; designs.&quot; Or even &quot;Co-creater of the new Box&quot;, whatever it is.
&gt;
&gt; You will be giving him that very credibility, that those &quot;do my shows&quot; are
&gt; looking for.  Maybe even getting him new customers.  Just by associating
&gt; with him on one project.
&gt;
&gt; My advice is, be careful that you aren&#x27;t just being used for your
&gt; credentials Frank.

&gt;   Yeah, real interesting, if ya know something about these various
&gt; &quot;players&quot; in the field. Yet they wonder why I don&#x27;t play those &quot;do my show&quot;
&gt; games. A certain amount here left unsaid, so not too many will get it.
