I have a deep interest in EVP&#39;s and communication from our other-side.  Don&#39;t have any prominent abilities - just a strong belief.\n\nThe reason I am posting right now is I was just on a site that was discussing the Ovilus (itcbridge.com)and someone named MICK mentioned this site and another person named REGAN responded.  Felt it was a good time to say hello!"}
