<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for the input on your personal experience Steve.  I&#x27;m still
going to try that and several other methods though.  The iPod method I
was talking about is no different than a standard EVPMaker attempt
(which a lot of people mention great success with).  Just playing the
chopped up file from an iPod instead of on the computer.

&gt; Marty,
&gt; 
&gt; I tried the IPOD thing a year ago and came to the conclusion that 
&gt; they need a live feed for communicating.  Not for messages, but real-
&gt; time back and forth stuff.

&gt; &gt; Andy, thanks for the compliments, much appreciated.  Main credit
&gt; &gt; should of course go to Frank though, he provided the main roadwork 
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; inspiration.  My main concern design wise for this was to have a
&gt; &gt; version that was compartmentalized (&quot;plug and play&quot; if you will) so
&gt; &gt; that components can be easily substituted for experimenting.  Plus
&gt; &gt; something lower powered to make it more portable, hence the idea to
&gt; &gt; use a low power speaker powered by the input device, and a
&gt; &gt; corresponding hearing assistance device as the mic/amp to amp it 
&gt; up. 
&gt; &gt; Once the lid is on, this thing is *loud* but clear.  In fact, I have
&gt; &gt; the amp set to min volume and its still a little to loud to listen 
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; with headphones sometimes unless you play around with equalizing the
&gt; &gt; volume settings on the 820 and the speaker.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m also going to be experimenting swapping out the 820 with an iPod
&gt; &gt; shuffle containing a lengthy pre-recorded sound file of audio.  30
&gt; &gt; second talk (maybe me reading the alphabet or something), chopped up
&gt; &gt; with EVP-Maker, and then spliced out to repeat for 30 minutes or 
&gt; so. 
&gt; &gt; I realize, as Frank stated previously, that they can effect sound
&gt; &gt; anywhere including in a control sound like this as its being 
&gt; recorded
&gt; &gt; or mixed.  But my concern is satisfying the &quot;skeptics&quot; out there 
&gt; who,
&gt; &gt; as you put it when you first joined the group, feel that using the
&gt; &gt; radio input it &quot;would be hard to distinguish from coincidence&quot;.  A
&gt; &gt; controlled input that can be referred back to for comparison would
&gt; &gt; satisfy that qualification that keeps getting thrown up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am loving this design. October hitting me pretty hard but will 
&gt; try
&gt; &gt; &gt; to scare up the jack to implement this design soon. thanks for 
&gt; your
&gt; &gt; &gt; hard work and posting easy-to-follow instructions.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks again,
