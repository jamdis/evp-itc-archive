Telling a child that there is more than what the eye can see, more than what the ears can hear, is giving them the basics for growing up with a mind thats open to possibility. What they do with that is up to them individually.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I worry more about the kids who grow up with parents who are alchoholics, drug addicts, liars, thieves, abusers, etcetera.. than anyone. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As for if the effect is positive or negative, I think that has to do with the intent or the approach taken by each individual whether it be ITC, religion, or life in general.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Misty&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On Thu, 1/22/09, Rick &lt;&lt;A rel=nofollow&gt;rasterer@yahoo. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Rick &lt;&lt;A rel=nofollow&gt;rasterer@yahoo. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Sociological question&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A rel=nofollow&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Thursday, January 22, 2009, 10:57 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I was wondering if anyone had an opinion on the impact\n of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; performing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ITC experiments or sessions, when there are young children&lt;BR&gt;&gt; around. Do&lt;BR&gt;&gt; you think the children seeing their parents or others (in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; person, not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; on TV) engaging in this activity would have an effect on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the children,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and if so, do you think the effect would be positive, or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; negative?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-378794817-1232733554=:78506--"}
