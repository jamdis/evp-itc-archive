<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>According to what C. M. has said, only 30 people in the entire world are able to use this box. He of course is one of those 30 people. I will be interested to know if the buyer is one of those 30 people :) I thought it would have gone for a lot more money than it sold for on Ebay.

Mr. Moon&#x27;s magazine (which I always thought was very well done and much better than the other one that is still out there) apparently has gone under. First it was just wait a little longer, we are going to have a great spring issue. Then it was we are going to have a great summer issue on line. Hold on until the fall issue, your subscription is still good. And then it was silence.

Any contact asking for a refund on your magazine subscription that was never fulfilled ends up with no response. Considering his reputation amongst the paranormal field has, at least in the past, been questionable, I am surprised he didn&#x27;t offer some kind of trade for paying for a magazine that people will never get now...like minutes on his special box, a reading from his mother....if he wasn&#x27;t going to give people their money back.

&gt; Time to share with the groups. Get it while you can. Not sure how many i will list, so this could be an opportunity that comes along only once. This box was the one Chris Moon has been using on his college lectures this fall.
