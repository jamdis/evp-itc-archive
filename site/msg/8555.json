Did you send the recording to him?\n\nHowever, what makes me wonder, and what I didn&#39;t expect is that certain\nspirits do apparently communicate only over certain methods - in your\ncase &#39;Arthur&#39; over EVPmaker, and &#39;David&#39; and your tech team over the\nmanual sweep method. Any possible explanation for this? Perhaps those on\nthe &#39;other side&#39; aren&#39;t &#39;allround techs&#39; but only &#39;specialists&#39; for\ncertain methods?\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\nam 30.03.2008 um 08:14 Uhr schriebst Du (u.a.):\nam 30.03.2008 um 08:14 Uhr schrieben Sie (u.a.):\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how to post this one.  You&#39;ll probably have to follow the text below in order to \n&gt; better understand the content.  This is in the SJ Allophones folder under Margaret Downey, \n&gt; and the clip is titled ConvoWIthArthur.mp3  (link at the end of the post - I think if you cut \n&gt; and paste, to open the file in another window,  you&#39;ll be able to follow the text written \n&gt; here)\n\n&gt; I ran a bunch of short sessions tonight (about 20 seconds each) asking a question, \n&gt; listening for the answer, then going onto the next based on what I heard previously. Most \n&gt; of these answers came very quickly. I have removed all of the non-relevant sound between \n&gt; Q&A, but very little has been modified in the answering phrase itself (just made them so it \n&gt; didn&#39;t sound like a stutter.)  Parts 4, 5, 6, and 7 were from a single session, because I was \n&gt; hearing the answer real-time, but not understanding it.  I thought Arthur was trying to tell \n&gt; me specifically what kid of pet.  Likewise, the last 2 parts were together in one session.\n\n&gt; I have lowered my voice to hopefully make the responses more clear. I&#39;m working to \n&gt; establish whether or not there is any indication of probable intentional communication \n&gt; taking place. So far, I&#39;d say there are very strong indicators.  \n\n&gt; Can you say A.B.C.?\n&gt; &quot;A.B.C.D.E.&quot;  (this answer is sort of buried in the main sound)\n\n&gt; How about Tom Butler?\n&gt; &quot;Tom Butler.&quot;\n\n&gt; Do you know the name of either of Tom Butler&#39;s cats?\n&gt; &quot;(Sh)asta&#39;s their cat.&quot; (the &quot;Sh&quot; sound is weak or missing)\n\n&gt; Do you have any pets?\n&gt; &quot;I have a pet.&quot;\n\n&gt; I heard you say I have a...?\n&gt; &quot;Pet.&quot;\n\n&gt; You have a what?\n&gt; &quot;Pet.&quot;\n\n&gt; What kind of pet do you have?\n&gt; &quot;An animal.&quot; (LOL- ask a silly question, get a silly answer!)\n\n&gt; I understand you have a pet animal, but what is the species?\n&gt; &quot;A purple deer.&quot;\n\n&gt; OK, I could have sworn you said you have a purple deer.\n&gt; &quot;I told you purple deer.&quot; \n\n&gt; OK, I&#39;m gonna close for the evening.  Can you tell me goodbye?\n&gt; &quot;I love you.&quot;\n\n&gt; I heard you say I love you.  Love you too.\n&gt; &quot;Thank you.&quot;\n\n&gt; The speed for this session was set on 106%, which is a little too fast for listening on \n&gt; playback, but I get good responses with the setting.  I have slowed the tempo on the \n&gt; answers by -18 in order to make them just a little clearer.  :-)\n\n&gt; http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/UB7vR4SGM4e8XM8JsTI-zUFjp0ELWi_d0cgCwV-\n&gt; pdi39E_RQq1-\n&gt; 7PSmvtA7pEVOD0V0eJQJOfnFdmcyDVHcnSJBiWzggVviQ7qOcjA/Margaret%20Downey/SJ%2\n&gt; 0Allophones/ConvoWithArthur.mp3\n\n\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n\n&gt; Yahoo!
