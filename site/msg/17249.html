<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi again,

Frank, thanks for the welcome.

I also believe that entities (or spirits, or whatever) exist in a dimension
from which they can access us across time and space... if they want to.
Some seem to choose particular times and/or locations, but that may be
putting the cart before the horse.

I&#x27;m not claiming that portals exist, per se.  Wormholes are a maybe, if
recent reports are accurate, but the technical reason/s why certain times
and locations seem to attract reports of the paranormal are -- in my opinion
-- secondary to what I&#x27;m doing.

(In fact, I&#x27;m not even certain that ghosts exist, per se.  That&#x27;s a
convenient term for a general set of phenomena, and it&#x27;s an explanation that
many people prefer to use for that phenomena.  But, in scientific terms --
something that can be duplicated in a lab -- we&#x27;re not even close to saying,
&quot;Those are ghosts, without a doubt.&quot;  With my readers, I try to separate the
emotion-related issues, from hard-core scientific study.  Both are important
within their respective contexts, but when people try to blur the lines
between them, arguments can ensue.)

I&#x27;m looking for the locations (and times) with the best odds of reported
paranormal activity, period.  Whether those patterns are caused by
expectations and/or preconceptions is a separate issue, and one that I hope
will become clearer when the patterns are.

At its simplest:  In some areas, people expect cemeteries to be haunted.
That&#x27;s a chicken-or-the-egg issue for me: Is the cemetery (and sometimes a
particular grave) &quot;haunted&quot; because of expectations, or for some other
reason?  (In most cases, that&#x27;s a rhetorical question.)

The one that baffles me is that, among &quot;haunted&quot; cemeteries, about 80% of
the reports are about the back left corner of the cemetery, relative to the
original, main gate. That&#x27;s not necessarily the most popular gate or the
current main gate.

Most people making reports don&#x27;t know the historical layout of the
cemeteries. That back left corner is not necessarily the oldest or most
neglected part of the cemetery.  A pattern seems to be there, but I&#x27;m not
sure why... yet.

Though I&#x27;m most associated with ghost research, I don&#x27;t limit the patterns
to ghost reports.  Aliens, crypto, faeries, weird crimes, freakish
weather... I&#x27;m simply looking at anomalous patterns.  So far, when I find
one set of reports -- say, ghosts -- I often discover parallel patterns of
UFO reports.  Since those two communities don&#x27;t often swap notes, the
correlations aren&#x27;t always evident at first glance.

But, whether it&#x27;s cultural conditioning (and expectations/preconceptions) or
something else, if someone wants to test &quot;ghost detecting&quot; equipment,
including EVP-related devices, they seem to get the best results in
locations where they (and others) expect to encounter ghosts.  So, my work
involves finding those places... and sometimes related time patterns.

Sure, it might be nothing more than a 19th century tale that&#x27;s making a
comeback among fifth graders, and now that old location is experiencing
early stages of a surge in ghost reports.  Expectations are high, and so are
the number of reports.

It might also be placebo effect from my own work.  I publicly say a spot is
going to start reporting ghosts, and -- sure enough -- weird phenomena are
reported.  That&#x27;s where measuring devices may weed out some contagion of
suggestion, but even with those devices, there&#x27;s a question of the power of
the observer. (The suggestions in the book &quot;Conjuring Up Philip&quot; are
important, and may relate to quantum-observer studies.  I think we&#x27;re more
at the phase of developing good questions and the tools that may improve
them, than finding certain answers.)

Time factors seem to have more variables than geographical patterns.  (For
that reason, a lot of my current work focuses on geographical links.)  Sure,
on the anniversary of a particular battle, a lot of people report &quot;ghostly&quot;
phenomena at that location. However, in that context, we&#x27;re far from being
able to separate expectations (and sheer numbers of observers) from
potential energy spikes.

I also believe that people who want to communicate with whatever-it-is...
well, that can be accomplished just as well at home.  In the dowsing (for
water, etc.) community, many people can work as well at home with a pendulum
(or rods) and a map, as they do on-site.  That doesn&#x27;t seem at all weird to
me, particularly if time and space are perceptions and merely some harmonic
of filing systems, suited to our particular universe/reality.

It makes equal sense that, at home, you&#x27;d have an abundance of entities
communicating through any device.

What would interest me is if more voices, or more particular kinds of
entities, come through at a particular time or place, if all other variables
are relatively consistent.

Frank, your three-month intervals related to ET contacts... they interest
me.

If I see anything related in my pattern studies, I&#x27;ll let you know.  Of
course, there are the six-month spikes at the end of October and at the and
of April, but those are so deeply, culturally ingrained expectations, I&#x27;m
back at chicken-or-the-egg.

Okay, this turned into a far longer reply than I had in mind. And, it
reveals far more of my geeky nature than I usually display in public.

For me, this is a nagging puzzle... and a fascinating one.

Cheerfully,
Fiona

&gt; Welcome Fiona!
&gt;
&gt;  Personally, I dopn&#x27;t believe in hainted hot spots, or portals. I think the
&gt; spirits and entities exist ina higher demension, and so have full access to
&gt; us and our speace, with virtually no linmitations.
&gt;
&gt;  I don&#x27;t go to hanunted areas to record, or test boxes, I do it from home
&gt; and have no shortage of contacts.
&gt;
&gt;  Paranormal activity is whereever one expects it to be.
&gt;
&gt;  There does seem to be conditions that limit contacts via EVP, similar to
&gt; radio propogation, which might make it seem like activeity is spiking. From
&gt; me, my ET contacts have about three month interval.
