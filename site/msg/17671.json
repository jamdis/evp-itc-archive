But wait, this is AM, where&#39;s the usual\n&gt; interference? At 5 seconds &quot;Wait---Navy&quot;, maybe that has to do with the old\n&gt; disaster.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Oh crap! I forgot to ask for the scientfic aproval before posting.\n&gt; Admittedly, I was being mean spirited on purpose, I&#39;m not going to allow\n&gt; some science dork to brow beat me into submission. I believe the home page\n&gt; of EVP-ITC says something to the effect that we don&#39;t follow science, this\n&gt; is for sharing information, and using the cut and try method, see what\n&gt; works. I know everyone hears different, and that&#39;s ok, that does not\n&gt; invalidate this stuff. My apologies for ruffling feathers.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
