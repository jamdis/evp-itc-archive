I have some \ninfromation at home I can put up. I have an article from a 1995 Popular \nElectronics on EVP that explains the diode method. Welcome to the group BTW.\n\nThe Spiricom is kinda complicated, and I&#39;ve heard that no one has been able \nto get it to work. I do have another method where I randomly tune a radio, \nand use the resulting random audio as a source of raw audio which the \nspirits can use to form their voices. It kinda complicated, but I have \nschematics on line at http://franksumption.tripod.com on the system \ninformation page. You almost have to have a scope to be able to get it to \nwork though, curiously, no one seems to be able to get my circuits to work \neither, altough others can use the &quot;boxes&quot;.\n\nThere are some methods that require very little equipment, one is EVPmaker, \nthat runs on a computer, and is freeware. \nhttp://www.stefanbion.de/evpmaker/index_e.htm\n\nAnother is using a foreign lanuge form shortwave, and just announce you&#39;re \ndoing an EVP recording, and rtecord the shortwave station open air, wiht the \nrecorder set up near the radio. On playback there should be phrases, and \nmessages in English.\n\nFrank\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Ryan&quot; &lt;hiii_98@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Hi guys i&#39;m new here and had a few questions.\n&gt;Date: Fri, 12 Jan 2007 02:34:09 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;Glad i somehow found this forum, was pointed here by some people who i\n&gt;believe know what they are talking about.  Anyhow i recently bought a\n&gt;germanium diode and also a tape recorder.  Is anyone familiar with how\n&gt;to setup the diode with my tape recorder to help &quot;enhance&quot; my chances\n&gt;of recieving a EVP recording?  I was hard to get these dang diodes, but\n&gt;now i dont know what to do with them.  I have a sodder gun and some\n&gt;wire, but no clue what to do with any of these parts yet.  Also I had\n&gt;some questions about the SpirtComm device and if anyone here is\n&gt;familiar with how to construct one (i would like to and already have\n&gt;the rough diagram available online).\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks\n&gt;Ryan\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDave vs. Carl: The Insignificant Championship Series. ���Who will win? \nhttp://clk.atdmt.com/MSN/go/msnnkwsp0070000001msn/direct/01/?href=http://davevscarl.spaces.live.com/?icid=T001MSN38C07001"}
