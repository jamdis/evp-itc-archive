          hey guy's 

I have been lucky enough to not only have Frank's box #12 but now Frank 
has gifted me with a brand new box #29.

Here are the first files to come out of it. And it has not even been 
imprinted by mike and lisa yet. These files are from the first 30 
seconds of the first session.

let me know what you think.
