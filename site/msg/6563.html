Ralph,
 
Hi buddy, I listened to all of your files. the only one I heard c=
omplete and clear
that sounded like a RS box file was the last one about th=
e dead batteries.
 
I listened to the one about the phone call carefully be=
cause I have recently received a couple of messages
from different boxes th=
at tell me to expect a spirit phone call, also another researcher from the =
group received a message 
pertaining to me getting a phone call. So this on=
e caught my particular attention.
 
I'm sorry to say Ralph that the phone c=
all file as well as a few others where way over processed due to editing an=
d sounded nothing like
box files.
Please do not take this as harsh criticis=
m, it is just some constructive advice stemming from my experience with thi=
s particular problem.
 
Ralph, what you want to do is keep your editing of =
the file and recording to a minimum, the less editing the more natural and =
believable 
a file will be for someone that may be skeptical of our researc=
h to begin with. Not just for that reason, over processing a tends to chang=
e
the file by adding and or subtracting certain nuances that would make up =
a certain word in the message. It also gives it that traditional,
robotic s=
ound that the old traditional EVP's would develop when an experimenter woul=
d try to bring out a faint evp from a recording.
 
It is just a bad habit t=
o get into. As for the rest of the files in the 469 folder, I heard a coupl=
e of words as labeled but can't other than the 
battery file say I heard an=
y whole file clearly and in tact.
 
The phone file in particular I heard th=
e first part but not the end part.
Do not be defensive about my advice, I h=
ave been there done that, which is why I feel qualified to give this advice=
.
 
If you would like to e-mail me off board to discuss it please do. paran=

ject: [EVP-ITC] Very interesting New Files and some old uploaded as Mp3's

=



Hi all,Ralph the Ghost Hunter here. Just letting you all know I have pos=
ted some new RS 12-469 files as MP3 files to save space. I hope you all enj=
oy them as some of these are very interesting. I doubt if any radio station=
s said any of what I posted on here from the RS Hack Box. You can tell me w=
hat your thoughts are on them if you like. Maybe some of you may understand=
 what they are trying to say. Oh well you all take care for now and keep up=
 the good work people. I do like the one that called me a " Dumb shit " LOL=
 when I asked " who are the Shadow People ? " They are funny sometimes. You=
 gotta love it. The RS 20-125 model seems to be alittle clearer with less c=
lutter I think. Will post some of those when I get a chance. Happy Sweeping=
 everyone !!!Regards,Ralph the Ghost Hunter
