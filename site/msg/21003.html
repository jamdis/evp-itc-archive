<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi!
Can anyone help me out in making a Frank&#x27;s Ghost Box...with easy steps of assembling the components...i would really appreciate ur efforts..
Secondly i have a question for u guys....i am using sony IC recorder model ICDPX820 533 hours recording for EVP but the limitation of this IC recorder is that it records in MP3 format which is not required as wav format is more reliable and is closest to what u actually hear. and the next is its frequency range is 75 hz to 20 k and above 20 k it does not record any thing...
so what is the best model available for EVP recording and is there anything which can be modified in the sony IC recorder so that it can record freq of more than 20 k...
Hey i know it is time taking to answer these questions..but i ill be obliged if somebody out of u help me out....
Thanks
Regards
Farrukh
