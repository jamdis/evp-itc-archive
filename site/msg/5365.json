She was 81.\n&gt; \n&gt; Everyone who has ever done EVP for investigations, research or\n&gt; personal study owes Sarah a huge debt.  She has left behind a\n&gt; phenomenal legacy: the AA-EVP, an international research \norganization\n&gt; she established in 1982; a classification of voices; a library of\n&gt; thousands of recordings she herself made over the years; and\n&gt; inspiration and passion that have fueled countless researchers.\n&gt; \n&gt; I became friends with Sarah several years ago, when I lived a few\n&gt; miles from her home in Annapolis, Maryland.  She was warm, witty and\n&gt; wonderful company, and she generously let me listen to many of her \nEVP\n&gt; recordings, and even experiment with her original reel-to-reel \nsetup.\n&gt;  She possessed a great store of knowledge, and a zest for\n&gt; investigating the unknown, especially the afterlife and survival.\n&gt; \n&gt; Things come full circle in remarkable ways.  The casket that now\n&gt; serves as the final resting place of Sarah&#39;s physical form was also\n&gt; the beginning of her remarkable study of the afterlife.  As a child,\n&gt; she once sneaked peeks into caskets at the funeral parlor owned by \nher\n&gt; grandparents in Altoona, Pennsylvania.  It seemed obvious to her \nthat\n&gt; death was an end, final.\n&gt; \n&gt; Later in life, she undertook EVP experiments to prove to herself \nthat\n&gt; there is no survival after death.  Night after night she recorded\n&gt; without results.  Just as she was about to give up, she recorded a\n&gt; clear female voice that said, &quot;Our world is one of beauty.&quot;  She \nwas a\n&gt; believer.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of her most remarkable EVPs was, &quot;Death no more a casket.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Sarah is now on the Other Side, discovering wonders that we here on\n&gt; this side only glimpse.  Undoubtedly we will hear much from her \n&gt; she&#39;s quite determined when she sets her mind to a task.\n&gt; \n&gt; The service for Sarah was lovely, and daughter Becky gave a moving\n&gt; eulogy.  Three white doves were released at graveside in Annapolis. \n&gt; Among those attending were Tom and Lisa Butler, who have led the \nAAEVP\n&gt; at its Reno headquarters since 2000, and Richard Shenk, a longtime\n&gt; AA-EVP member and researcher from Delaware.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sarah&#39;s last public appearance was in 2006, at the AA-EVP conference\n&gt; in Atlanta.  She delivered a marvelous speech on her career in EVP,\n&gt; and was recognized with a lifetime achievement award.\n&gt; \n&gt; The AA-EVP is establishing a memorial fund in Sarah&#39;s name to help\n&gt; continue research.  Contributions may be made to the AAEVP, PO Box\n&gt; 1311, Reno, NV 89507.\n&gt; \n&gt; My article on Sarah, her life and research (FATE Magazine, December\n&gt; 2004), is posted on my website at\n&gt; http://www.visionaryliving.com/articles/estep.php.\n&gt; ###\n&gt;"}
