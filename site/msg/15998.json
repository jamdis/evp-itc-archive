I got more parts ordered along with printed circuit boards. Soooo, might be able to produce something a bit more professional looking. I&#39;d like to make two versions, TRF, and hetrodyne, but it&#39;s going to take a while to get it all together. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I tried recording on the boat with a shack hack, the 470, but only got he usual doomsville junk I get everywhere. FM was the only mode cuz the metal ship hull shileds out all AM signals unless you hand the box out a port hole. Even FM was spotty. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Shermer&#39;s talk/presentation was interresting!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; F-S\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  This was coming back to Denver, Security never even looked inside the boxes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the way, even with all the electronics and echo chambers made out of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pipe. &quot;We don&#39;t need to look at these boxes&quot;-- waving the hand using the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; force.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\nSince I am a newby can anyone help me on how to get started and what equipment I would need?  I have talked to a spirit on the other side but it was through someone.  That is why I am interested in how to obtain Frank&#39;s box.  Thanks for your help\n\nAileen"}
