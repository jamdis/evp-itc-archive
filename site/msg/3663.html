<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Exactly right, Frank. But corporate hackles are easily raised and  
company brands are precious to them and very easily tainted. Look at  
the aftermath of the Tylenol poisonings of the late 1970s--people  
associated death with the product, despite the fact that someone  
completely unassociated tampered with the drugs. For years, Johnson  
and Johnson has been fighting against a rumor started by a competitor  
that their CEO was a member of the Church of Satan--they even went so  
far as to drop their 100-year-old company logo because it had a moon  
and stars in it, just to try to stop the Satanism rumor. My concern  
was that someone had written Radio Shack Corp and told them that some  
devil worshipers or some such where using the company&#x27;s products to  
promote witchcraft or anti-Christian sentiment or whatever.

Anyway, if that is not the case, then hooray.

&gt; Judy, and everyone else, too--please don&#x27;t promote or continue this  
&gt; until we hear from Sum. This may not be what everyone is assuming  
&gt; at all. My concern is that he has received a cease-and-desist  
&gt; notice from Radio Shack, which may have been informed that someone  
&gt; was promoting their product in a way not in compliment with their  
&gt; corporate image, and that his counsel is advising he comply with  
&gt; it. What you are telling people to do may be exactly what his own  
&gt; legal counsel is advising against and may put him in a precarious  
&gt; situation.
&gt;
&gt; Please just calm down and don&#x27;t make assumption until he can  
&gt; clarify for us. If it comes down to someone making personal threats  
&gt; against him, that&#x27;s a whole other matter. But he needs to ask for  
&gt; help before everyone goes all posse, OK?
