Wi=\r\nth the LM555 timer, you can a add transistor to make a constant current sou=\r\nrce on the threshold pin, and it puts out a linear ramp, but that only give=\r\ns one way tuning on a radio, it&#39;ll sweep up the band, then reset to the beg=\r\ninning of the band, instead of going back down the band. I don&#39;t think that=\r\n&#39;s usable for my purposes. I use a square wave that goes through an integra=\r\ntor to convert it a triangle, so the voltage sweeps up smoothly, then back =\r\ndown smoothly. It&#39;s possible to run op amps on a single supply with some bi=\r\nasing tricks. I might try that combined with the square wave output of a 55=\r\n5. The goal being to get rid of one of the battery packs. I use gel cells, =\r\nwhich have significant weight, and cost.\n   \n   Random mode is problematic,=\r\n unstable, and doesn&#39;t seem to work compared to the linear mode. Curious th=\r\nat it worked ok when that&#39;s all I had, now I can&#39;t get that mode to work wi=\r\nth any of my new boxes. Random in the new box would not work at the Stanely=\r\n. Some have requested I leave it in, but it&#39;s just not worth the headache. =\r\n\n   \n   The system can be simplified, like leave out the mic amps, and soun=\r\nd chamber, providing only a line output to go to a recorder, and speaker dr=\r\niver. It&#39;s been my experience recently that spirits do not need the sound c=\r\nhamber(aka echo box), and recording directly from a swept tuner works just =\r\nfine, and results in possibly clearer communications. There&#39;s less places t=\r\no introduce distortion and noise. Random results in broken up voices and ph=\r\nrases, and longer broadcast fragments. With good conditions, linear provide=\r\ns longer phrases, and more coherent messages. The &quot;good conditions&quot; being s=\r\nimilar to radio propogation&quot;, in that sonmetimes it&#39;s good, and clear, and =\r\nother times it&#39;s not. There seems to be a three month cycle in the propogat=\r\nion effects, but I have nothing documented. \n   \n   There is yet another me=\r\nthod of raw audio, use a foreign language shortwave broadcast that you don&#39;=\r\nt understand. Announce you&#39;re doing an EVP recording, and record some of th=\r\ne  broadcast.  On playback there should be coherent, and meaningful message=\r\ns in your language.  Curiously, people that speak whatever language you use=\r\n don&#39;t hear the messages. You could even use stuff off the web, like Chines=\r\ne news or whatever. This stuff is trickier, cuz some of what is heard could=\r\n be a trick of the mind, but that&#39;s true with any method. I did use this up=\r\n hunting last year, and the other guys could hear the messages I was gettin=\r\ng using Chinese shortwave--they also heard the english messages mixed in wi=\r\nth Chinese. It&#39;s not just the occasional word that sounds like English, it&#39;=\r\ns coherent phrases with meaning to the person doing the recording.
