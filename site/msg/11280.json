He \ncharges $250 for a half hour session with this box.  I wouldn&#39;t be so irritated had he just \ncalled it something else, but this is Frank&#39;s and it should be up to Frank how this box is used.  \nI think using it to make money is wrong.  I am not saying it would be wrong for Frank to \nmarket it it, at a reasonable price, but to charge $250 for a session that is under the \ninterpretation of Chris Moon is just playing on those who are suffering from a loss and \nlooking for a connection."}
