How can a skeptic type judge others research if\nhe don&#39;t do any research? Like a food critic that only dines at MacDonald&#39;s,\nyet critiques major restaurants.\n\n&quot;I think your instinct to stop posting this stuff might have been a good\none.

Not only do you not control\n&gt; what the &#39;spirits&#39; say, you also don&#39;t control what broadcast radio says,\n&gt; and to a large extent you don&#39;t control what your brain finds and interprets\n&gt; in the noise you are hearing.\n&gt;\n&gt; I listened to these (trying not to look at the labels, since once a person\n&gt; looks at the labels, they prime their brains to interpret the sounds in YOUR\n&gt; way, not their own way).  To me, they were either just a mess of random\n&gt; radio snippets, exactly what you&#39;d expect if a 3 year old were randomly\n&gt; twisting the radio dial, or they were just noise.  Nothing paranormal in the\n&gt; least.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think your instinct to stop posting this stuff might have been a good\n&gt; one. I suspect you are feeling a bit overwhelmed with this field right now,\n&gt; and it may be something is nagging at you inside someplace, saying it is a\n&gt; waste of your time or a burden on your life and health, or that you just\n&gt; need a little more space for a while.\n&gt;\n&gt; In any case, I&#39;d recommend a break: take a nice month off.  See how you\n&gt; feel being away from all this for a while.  Come back fresh if you feel ok\n&gt; after that.  But if you feel obsessed when away, it might be good to ask\n&gt; your friends and loved ones for some opinions on what they see in you.  Your\n&gt; health is more important than anything here anyways, and you can&#39;t really do\n&gt; a job with interpretation of your results, much less your other\n&gt; responsibilities in life, unless you put your health first.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Fri, 7/9/10, SnowfireL@... &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: SnowfireL@... &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Last nights files, [13 Attachments]\n&gt; To: inside_the_box_rtsc_ghost_box_research@yahoogroups.com,\n&gt; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, RTSC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, July 9, 2010, 7:26 AM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Well, got no response out of the other list, let&#39;s see if any of you\n&gt; folks on these lists can hear these at all. They may be too fast, but I did\n&gt; try to slow them a bit,  I know, these are very hard to hear, got them last\n&gt; night in response to Steve&#39;s letter about all the &quot;religious&quot;  crap I&#39;ve\n&gt; been sending,  such weird files I sometimes send in lately.  I do not\n&gt; control what spirits say though, after all they are just people too.  Got\n&gt; one on here that&#39;s really funny, I think it has a little demon on it too, he\n&gt; seems very angry, and wants someone to &quot;Let me out!  Let me out!&quot; is what he\n&gt; is saying, I think he is wanting to come after some folks, because, even\n&gt; demon&#39;s believe in God.  He really sounds mad at some people and wants\n&gt; &quot;.....out,&quot; just going to let you hear it, may need to play it several times\n&gt; to hear, but I think its kinda cute. I told them what some on the lists\n&gt; were saying, and this was the response.  btw  Is someone going to Florida ?\n&gt; The last one says something about FL Hope you all enjoy them. sf*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\nSo RJ--whe e's you EVPs?
