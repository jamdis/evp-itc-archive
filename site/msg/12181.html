<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Very cool, but on this flip side, very frightening. I guess I am a
control freak, but seem scary to be able to be influenced like that.
Guess I will leave my deflector shields on ;)

Btw congrats on the flowers, I tried bonsai once, lol didn&#x27;t fair to
well for myself or the poor tree...

thanks,
Andy

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I was laying in bed the other night thinking,  after having spent the  
&gt; evening reading about fall gardening, how odd it was that mysteriously  
&gt; I had planted every single plant, of the numerous perennials I have  
&gt; been planting, as if I&#x27;d read how to do it from a text book. No prior  
&gt; knowledge of these plants prior to hastily wanting to get them in the  
&gt; ground before the first freeze. And then it dawned on me, since I get  
&gt; many evp&#x27;s from beings who refer to themselves as nature spirits, that  
&gt; perhaps those we record can (and do) influence us in many ways. ???  
&gt; Just a thought.
&gt; 
&gt; I have to wonder if I was being led on a subconscious level to plant  
&gt; each species correctly. This idea also made me wonder how we are  
&gt; influenced by spirit on a daily basis...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyhoo, I&#x27;ve been quiet as I&#x27;m in a flurry to repot orchids and plant  
&gt; perennials before the cold hits next month and with looking up species  
&gt; for shady areas, I was surprised to find it was as if I had been had  
&gt; led in planting each species correctly. Even the watering, etc...! The  
&gt; good people of Findhorn (Scotland) and Perelandra (US) rely on  
&gt; intuition and contact with nature to tend to their gardens. Perhaps  
&gt; those of us that record are guided more than we think! Food for  
&gt; thought. :)
