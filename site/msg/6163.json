Despite the fact\nthat I&#39;m told my technician&#39;s name is David (which is also the name of\nsomeone else&#39;s technician here), it&#39;s Mike and Lisa whose names I hear\nover and over and over. I hear the name or number Seven; I often hear\nthe name Frank. I was speculating that that is Sumption, but it may be\nanother technician.\n\nSo, we&#39;ve got Mike, Lisa, Seven, David, and possibly Frank, who seem\nto be operating for most of us.\n\nAnyone else have a technician that I am missing?\n\nAnn\n\n&gt;  I personally believe I received responses \n&gt; yesterday from &quot;Mike & Lisa.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yet, I still wonder if they are referencing the time being short, \n&gt; with respect to whatever is coming.  Maybe they mean the thinning of \n&gt; the veil between spirit and physical??.\n&gt; \n&gt; How many technicians are out there?  How many have been identified?  \n&gt; I know mine have been male-female sounding...others?\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/ \n&gt; &gt; &gt; index.htmlfiles\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lcdupla &lt;lcdupla@&gt;\n\n\n&gt;"}
