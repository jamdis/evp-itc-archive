the spirit that was communicating actually burps and then says 'pardon
me please' the file is longer
and you can tell that it was not me that burped because it occurs on
top of me saying the word frequency.

I believe the entity had traveled through the box and was in the same
room with me when this occured.
I have a theory that when a box is in use it opens not only a line of
live communication but also a portal that spirits can use to
travel back and forth during a session.

that is the reason at the end of each session I ask that any spirits
that may have come through while the box was on
please go back or you will be stuck here until the next session. I
always get conformation from my techs that any and all are back.

listen to the file and let me know what you think
