<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Misty,

I&#x27;m glad you shared what you heard... I thought I heard something 
like that too. I also thought I heard the word &quot;Peace&quot; a number of 
times.

&gt; Interesting Mike. Frank spoke about making a copper box because 
they mentioned it. I kept saying reminds me of a faraday cage. Also 
interesting when you shut the door and its on AM at 1:54 in the video 
I hear &quot;Your ghostbox box&quot;. I hear a little more after that but thats 
what I hear clearest LOL
&gt; 
&gt; A box for your box. LOL at least you didnt press the on button.

&gt; &gt; While reading a book about spirit communication, there was a
&gt; &gt; chapter 
&gt; &gt; which referenced the Faraday Cage.  So... after reading it
&gt; &gt; I decided to 
&gt; &gt; try out what the book suggested and placed my Radio Shack
&gt; &gt; Hack 12-470 
&gt; &gt; Ghost Box into my microwave oven (in the OFF position) and
&gt; &gt; ran a sweep 
&gt; &gt; in the AM and FM mode.
&gt; &gt; The AM mode did receive much less but a few audio snippets
&gt; &gt; did make 
&gt; &gt; their way through.  The FM mode was a different story. No
&gt; &gt; frequencies 
&gt; &gt; at all made it through... just white noise as each FM
&gt; &gt; frequency was 
&gt; &gt; reached during the sweep.
&gt; &gt; As I always do... I made a short video of both modes being
&gt; &gt; sweeped.
&gt; &gt; You can see it, here:
