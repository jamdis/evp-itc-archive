<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am posting two file that I have not labeled. Per sharons request.
I believe this is a good way to post some files from time to time just 
to see what other researchers hear that you deem clear.

I&#x27;m sure this will be interesting given the fact that some people hear 
the same message differently on purpous if the entity that sent it 
meant it for the researcher alone to hear. This experiment over time 
will tell us if messages recieved by individual researchers fall into 
to types of categories IE general and personal.

I suggest we listen to the unlabeled file give an opinion on what we 
hear and when the opinions are in then the file can be posted with what 
the researcher that recieved it hears and then listened to again  by 
all to see if anyone changes thier mind and how much is the titles 
power of suggestion over the listener.

good luck and lets try to accomplish this experiment.
