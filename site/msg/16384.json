I believe there IS a potential for danger in what we do.  I think a discussion of the risks would be frowned upon here because it would necessarily involve the &quot;religious&quot; aspect.  Therefore, if you want to communicate privately, I am open to that.\nJim C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Al Harris &lt;algerharris@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Jim,\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, I was going to stop but then some experienced members at another\n&gt; group (RTSC) explained how I could protect myself from the negative\n&gt; entities.
