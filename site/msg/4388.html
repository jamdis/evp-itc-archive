Hiya Willy (hehe I like that)
   
  You are right there are alot of Bills around here LOL
   
  I did actually get to listen to some of your desert files when you posted them but I had to leave for work so didnt get a chance to do anything at the time. I will give you a rundown of them all here with any differences or changes I hear in *asterisks*
   
  AndAmazinglyRicksHotIdea*Help* (same but I hear that additional word on end)
ButYouCalledToUs*It's Better* (")
CheckThis*GroupEnergyWhatDoTheyTalkToAtNight* (several differences)
EachDifferentWavelengthMoves*InUsToSync* (same but additional words on end)
*WhatWeSee*ThatWasASpacecraft (I hear that as a multilayer. I hear what you hear with that other voice on top at start)
ThereAreNoEntities*Ivebeensenttoearthtobeginthedeparted* (etcetera)
  
 I will try and get back to you on more and some of the other set. Just tired now, its been a long work day. Great stuff tho keep it up. Glad they answered some of your questions for you. Ive seen quite a bit of strangeness over the years. And I know what its like to have those around you living in thier own bubble worlds...but just remember they think the same about us hehehe. Who's bubble is better? 
   
  Can definitely say its all very interesting! And I enjoy bursting my own bubble now and then but never touch thiers =) We cant change anyone, except ourselves. They have to change themselves on thier own. But we can try to share, for those who seek to learn.

          OK, so maybe I went over the top yesterday describing my laptop 
setup and how I use it � sorry. I did post a bunch of EVPs 
under "Laptop EVPs" in the files. What I didn't make clear is that I'd 
really appreciate some comments/critiques/suggestions on what I've 
done. I've gotten a lot of stuff and would really like to run it by 
someone else. I asked my wife, and she got a blank look, blinked 
twice, turned and walked away. My teenage son listened to one clip 
twice, heard what I did, then had more important stuff to do. So, it 
would be nice to get some feedback on what I've done so far�.
I've read that "lower entities" come across more on EVPmaker, but so 
far I haven't had any rude experiences � yet. Two days ago I forgot to 
start the sessions with protection prayer/rules of engagement, and 
right away a Scottish voice said, "Aye, it smells in here." I've got 
another folder worth of stuff to upload, but want to get some comments 
about my previous files first..
I've noticed two Bills here already, so to avoid confusion, I'll go by 
Willy�.
Thanks
Willy
