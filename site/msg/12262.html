<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Funny you should mention using a medium to communicate with this 
system.  That dediated group in the 1960&#x27;s first used mediums in 
conjunction with their electronic equipment.
The mediums were used to relay the words or feelings they heard or 
felt from the spirits that were attracted to the different modes of 
frequencies that the experimentors.

I&#x27;m in Colorado Springs, Colorado; in the same neighborhood where 
Nikola Tesla did his experiments while in this city for about 6-8 
months. His lab was located about a 3 minute drive from my house.

&gt; Mike,
&gt; I have an idea for you to think about and possibly consider 
trying.  mediums, as you know are about a dime per dozen these days. 
Have you considered video taping a medium before, during and after a 
reading was being done? 
&gt; Once while some of our smaller group in Muskegon, MI were out ghost 
hunting one afternoon, I sensed a spirit nearby and asked some of the 
members to use their EMF equipment to see if they could pickup 
anything. One guy had a positive reaction to a spirit that was 
standing in front of me. His EMF detector showed a few blips and then 
the spirit was gone. I was still communicating with the spirit after 
the blimps stopped. Might be worth trying as an experiment.
&gt; Mike, where are you located?

&gt; Hi Al,
&gt; 
&gt; To answer your first question I provide this link:
&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S-4e-wxd6U
&gt; It&#x27;s a video that better explains how I think it might work. (Just 
a 
&gt; couple of possibilites).
&gt; 
&gt; To answer your second question... I have done three experimentation 
&gt; sessions so far, and the results differ. In one I got no response, 
&gt; and in the other two I did get action but I&#x27;m unsure on what caused 
&gt; it. I&#x27;m reviewing it further.
&gt; 
&gt; My use of the Ion lamp, which is away from the traditional &#x27;video-
&gt; loop&#x27; method is based on things I&#x27;ve read from those who were into 
&gt; this EVP/ITC thing way before us. Back in the 1960&#x27;s there was much 
&gt; experimentation going on that involved a varied range of 
frequencies, 
&gt; including light frequencies. Even house plants were considered into 
&gt; the EVP/ITC equation (Maybe I&#x27;ll try that next).
&gt; 
&gt; My use of the Ion lamp goes along with a continued desire to 
further 
&gt; the work of the dedicated group from the 1960&#x27;s... and continue to 
&gt; see if &#x27;other&#x27; ideas work.
&gt; 
&gt; After all... sweeping radio signals, and snowy video pictures are 
&gt; only a couple of snippets of the frequencies available for 
&gt; experimentation. Even my limited idea of what the Ion lamp might do 
&gt; could be way off... but I have to try it. I might be surprised what 
&gt; it might be capable of. It might not only offer increased intensity 
&gt; and stimulation. Maybe it could even offer more than that.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ll keep trying new things... and I&#x27;ll make sure to share them 
with 
&gt; the group.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for asking...
&gt; 
&gt; - Mike

&gt; &gt; An interesting setup, Mike...
&gt; &gt; I do have a question though.,..what is the ion lamp for? 
&gt; &gt; Have you had any success photographing any spirits?
