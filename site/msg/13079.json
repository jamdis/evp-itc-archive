We always start out by saying we&#39;re \nnot there to hurt or damage anyone and we thank whomever for any responses \nwe get and at the end thank them for letting us be there. Even if we \ndidn&#39;t get any sort of a response.\n\nI don&#39;t know why the dumb comments when they hear a sound or get some sort \nof a response. You&#39;d think that since they are in a supposedly haunted \nplace, they&#39;d expect and be looking for odd noises, etc. But then again \nit&#39;s TV-land.\n\nZack\n\n\n\nOn Sat, 13 Dec 2008, Rhonda W wrote:\n\n&gt; Im sitting here watching Ghost Hunters...and I know alot of it is done for drama purposes...but Im curious...when ya&#39;ll are out on an investigation do you talk as much as they do?� I can hardly hear anything over them chatting.� Also I notice a cpl of their people freak out when they get knocks or other responses...nobody ever says hey thanks for the effort you put into responding or great job or anything like that..its always wtf was that, what the hell is going on in here, etc...do ya&#39;ll say thanks and compliment the efforts of the responding spirits?� Ive never been on an investigation with a team so Im kinda curious how different groups work and run things.(wish I knew people in arizona I could go on an investigation with)� I know when I do my research here with my radio shack hack I always say thanks and am polite and have never freaked out or cussed in response to one of the responses Ive gotten.� Anyways just curious.� Hope everyone has a\n&gt; great weekend!\n&gt; �\n&gt; Rhonda\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\r\n--297796611-1185411321-1229187591=:7508--"}
