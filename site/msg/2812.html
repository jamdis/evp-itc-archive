Hi,

I am a newcomer...but not to the paranormal..I've been hooked as long =
as I can remember, from feelings of dejavu, to insisting to my parents that=
 I "saw" their wedding, I now believe i saw this from spirit realms (my mom=
 was pregnant with me)....it felt as though I was watching thier union from=
 an ex emplorary view point (like on widescrean HD, which did not exist in =
1968), I often asked about their "movie" to answers of : I dreamt it etc...=
.but I still remember being child like and asking parent like beings: is th=
at my parents?? I don't remeber a reply in words just an "undersatnding" ..=
.hence lots more has happened, and to cut a long story short my interest in=
 EVP and proof that we exist before birth and after death......

 Re: [EVP-ITC] Nothin'!



  Your right Frank, it all depends on expectatio=
ns and what degree of proof it will take for someone to accept the existenc=
e of the beyond and the entities who reside there. People all over the worl=
d scream for proof but yet if you ask them they cannot define what criteria=
 they require for proof. Why? Because they are so brainwashed in our societ=
ies materialistic teachings they never expect to receive proof, so they don=
't even bother to define such a criteria.

  Its amazing to me that a prima=
rily spiritual creature such as ourselves can deny our connections with tha=
t world and the source. The connections we experience everyday and at all t=
imes in the form of dreams, random thoughts and inspirations are so easily =
taken for granted and written off as figments of imagination, trivial thoug=
hts and meaningless aspirations. Even as a child I knew I was unique as was=
 every person on the face of the planet. I knew that their were as many per=
spectives of reality as their were people to have them and that each and ev=
ery one of them were just as valid as the other no matter how outlandish it=
 seemed to me.

  Acceptance was taught to me instead of beliefs. Beliefs c=
an enhance the truth but they are not in themselves true.

  More than I ex=
pected to write but I feel it is still valid,

  Best regards,

  Frank R.

    I know how hard it is for you sometimes with what the guy=
