<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Dave,

yes, you could use Audition (or another audio editor that supports cue lists) to delete the entry of individual allophone from the cue list. (Using another editor may result in loss of the cue list.)

&gt; Stefan,
&gt;  Should we try to edit out some of these allophones on the master file as a
&gt; test? Are they in order on the indexed file? 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Dave

&gt; Hi Bruce,
&gt; 
&gt; in fact one has to be cautious as to &quot;false positives&quot; when using this
&gt; method, especially for 1-syllable words like &quot;(h)ear, &quot;air&quot; and &quot;I&quot;. Some of
&gt; the SpeakJet allophones are diphthongs, e.g. #22 (&quot;IYRR&quot; like in &quot;Clear,
&gt; Hear, Year&quot;), #23 (&quot;EYRR&quot; like in &quot;Hair, Stair, Repair&quot;), or #30 (&quot;OHIH&quot;
&gt; like in &quot;Sky, Five, I&quot;). There are only 72 different allophones, so the
&gt; probability that one-syllable words like &quot;(h)ear/here&quot; , &quot;air&quot;, and &quot;I&quot;
&gt; appear, is relatively high.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t assume that everything that is received by this method is true
&gt; communication. As with every method, it depends on various factors like
&gt; meaningfulness, relatedness, length of the message, etc., if a message is
&gt; regarded as a valid EVP.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; To all that are experimenting with the EVPM allaphone file method.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have done a few sessions with this method as I know a  few other 
&gt; &gt; researchers have.
&gt; &gt; There have been a couple of researchers that have done sessions and 
&gt; &gt; gotten very similar responses such as the name &quot;Arthur&quot; and responses 
&gt; &gt; pertaining to &quot;Air&quot; also &quot;I am here&quot; or &quot;here&quot;.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have also gotten direct and intelligible answers to questions 
&gt; &gt; immediately following the question, and messages that could never be 
&gt; &gt; construed as random.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The test that I propose and the answer I seek is, The words that keep 
&gt; &gt; coming up to almost all researchers experimenting with this method IE 
&gt; &gt; the words I mentioned above.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would like to find out whether these certain words are simply by 
&gt; &gt; products of everyone using the same file and come up as a result of 
&gt; &gt; the file playing in evpm, or are they true entity communication.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The only questionable content are these few words not all the methods 
&gt; &gt; communication. In my opinion the majority of the communication from 
&gt; &gt; this method is genuine.
&gt; &gt; The method has produced communication including my name to me as well 
&gt; &gt; as other researchers that have gotten my name, and some of the 
&gt; &gt; statements and responses show signs of a sense of humor that would 
&gt; &gt; surely be absent in random word grouping.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Who ever is involved with experimentation of this method, will you 
&gt; &gt; please on your next session ask that if there is a spirit named 
&gt; &gt; Arthur for him not to mention his name or the list of words that I 
&gt; &gt; have posted. I suggest that this request be made verbally before the 
&gt; &gt; session as well as after.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And in the most polite manner. They seem to respond better to 
&gt; &gt; formality.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; please dedicate one session no shorter than 2 minutes to this 
&gt; &gt; experiment and post your results.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Your cooperation appreciated.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Bruce
