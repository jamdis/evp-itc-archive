 In working with LM3820, that's the Delco radio chips I got form B.G. Micr=
o at 12 cents each, I had the things working a while back on the breadbord,=
 but the chips would not work when wired up on a circuit board. I drew the =
damn schematic wrong!!! I'm wiring a new board, and looking at the orignina=
l schematic I had on -line, and I'm thinking what the f---, this ain't righ=
t. I haven't powered up the board yet, but it should work----this time.

 I keep telling everyone you hear what you want to hear, or what the subco=
ncious mind projects, even onto pre-recorded tapes! Listening last night to=
 the tape I did Sunday night, and the Ol' Lady yells out that the mattress =
heater was not working, and the very next voice on the tape is about the ma=
tress heater not working! I doubt very much that anyone else would hear it,=
 but that is the probelm with this stuff, few hear what others hear. Was th=
e heater voice "real"--I can't tell!! Maybe it's a precongnitive voice--I c=
an't tell! I think we create some this stuff on the fly, which is very prob=
lematic for the research, but it has to be addressed.
