Frank spoke about making a copper box because they mentioned it. I kept saying reminds me of a faraday cage. Also interesting when you shut the door and its on AM at 1:54 in the video I hear &quot;Your ghostbox box&quot;. I hear a little more after that but thats what I hear clearest LOL\n\nA box for your box. LOL at least you didnt press the on button.\n\nMisty\n\n\n--- On Sun, 11/9/08, M.A. Coletta (Mike) &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: M.A. Coletta (Mike) &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Ghost Box in a Faraday Cage type enclosure\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, November 9, 2008, 1:23 PM\n&gt; While reading a book about spirit communication, there was a\n&gt; chapter \n&gt; which referenced the Faraday Cage.  So... after reading it\n&gt; I decided to \n&gt; try out what the book suggested and placed my Radio Shack\n&gt; Hack 12-470 \n&gt; Ghost Box into my microwave oven (in the OFF position) and\n&gt; ran a sweep \n&gt; in the AM and FM mode.\n&gt; The AM mode did receive much less but a few audio snippets\n&gt; did make \n&gt; their way through.  The FM mode was a different story. No\n&gt; frequencies \n&gt; at all made it through... just white noise as each FM\n&gt; frequency was \n&gt; reached during the sweep.\n&gt; As I always do... I made a short video of both modes being\n&gt; sweeped.\n&gt; You can see it, here:\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQwYmi70-qw\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; - Mike (UFO Geek)"}
