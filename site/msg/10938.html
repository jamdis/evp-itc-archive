          Greetings everyone! My name is Tim Wise. I am a lead investigator
for the Bluegrass Ghost Chasers in Frankfort, KY. I recently found
the video instructions by UFO geek on the hack for the RS 12-469 radio
and have built myself a small Ghost box. I've become intrigued with
the prospect of taking this with the group on investigations and
should have a chance to take it with me to Waverly Hills Sanatorium
late next month. I also found this group through Mike's Blog site. 
Any and all tips and opinions will be greatly appreciated and if I
come up with anything I'll make sure and share with this group.
