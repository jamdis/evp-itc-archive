<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello. I&#x27;m sort of new to the group. I&#x27;ve been observing but not posting
much. Most of my experiences have been personal and I have decided to take
it up a notch and join a group. My trouble has been that most groups I have
encountered are simply unorganized or unmotivated (in it for the t-shirts).
I went with a group recently to an old cabin for what turned out to be an
hour and a half investigation. I got around 8 EVPs, some photos, and a
couple of noise responses on my recorder. My first attempt with a flash
light got me a half an hour worth of consistent responses. When I got my
first recorder I got 3 EVPs while reading the instructions. I&#x27;m a magnet and
for the first time in my life it doesn&#x27;t scare me. What does scare me is
that my kids are just as effected. So I want to learn as much as I can on an
interactive level so I can not only educate myself but protect my kids. Is
anyone in the Toledo area interested in doing investigations?

Here is my personal page. It&#x27;s a freebie website that I recently started to
organize some of my evidence. Don&#x27;t mind the construction. But here&#x27;s a link
to my EVPs on my recent investigation I mentioned above. I very much would
appreciate any feedback or comments.

I would like to also know if anyone is familiar with the name &quot;Attoy&quot; (guess
of spelling)

I recently tried communicating on a box I got off of Ebay. I asked for a
name and heard &quot;toy&quot;. I asked again and I again heard &quot;toy&quot;.
I didn&#x27;t think much of it until later that day my 2 year old climbs on my
lap, looks at an empty space, gets very excited, starts waving and says &quot;toy
a toy&quot;
I later asked my 3 year old if she knew anybody named &quot;toy&quot; and she
corrected me by saying &quot;Atoy. He&#x27;s a boy.&quot; I asked her how old he was. She
looked confused for a second and replied &quot;He&#x27;s still 4.&quot; She said he&#x27;s
happy, not sick, little like her, and only says nice words. When I asked her
where she met him she replied &quot;the living room.&quot; When I asked her how long
he&#x27;s been there she unhesitatingly began to reply &quot;5 years&quot; but only said &quot;5
ye&quot; She doesn&#x27;t understand the concept of a year. She did say he&#x27;s been
there as long as she can remember. I can remember my older daughter in a
previous house smiling and saying &quot;hi&quot; to nothing as a baby. I have EVP&#x27;s of
breaths from the house as well. They all sound like children. One I have is
of what I believe to be cheyne stokes. I only recognized this because I&#x27;m a
nurse. It&#x27;s a particular breathing pattern that people sometimes have with
imminent death. I would appreciate any suggestions on how to communicate
more with him.
