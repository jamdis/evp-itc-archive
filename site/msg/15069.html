The name aether is sometimes still used but now it is called cosmic backgro=

 field. The only way it can be proven to exist is in reference to accelerat=
ion. The zero-point field is theories to penetrate all things accept for a =
charged medium, which instead gives you a distortion field in the zero-poin=
t field we call a magnetic field. The zero-point field is the "canvas" that=
 the universe and all matter is painted on. It is the only thing that still=
 oscillates at absolute zero when all other systems cease to move. This osc=

You can create a wave in anything. You can create a wave in a rope by h=
aving a person hold each end and then having one person wiggle the rope. Yo=
u can create a wave in a lake by dropping a rock into it. The thing that ca=
rries the wave is the propagating medium. In these examples it's the rope a=
nd water respectively.
=A0
In the case of sound, the propagating medium is =
the air. It is a longitudinal pressure wave. It cannot be picked up on a re=
ceiver that is capable of receiving the same frequencies as electromagnetic=
 waves.
=A0
There are receivers and antennas that can pick up electromagnet=
ic waves of the same frequencies as sound waves. But in this case, the prop=
agating medium is the aether. They are transverse electromagnetic waves and=
 you can't hear them.

The electromagnetic spectrum extends from sub-audibl=

Different methods exist to detect or receive different parts of this spectr=
um. I'm involved in a ULF group that specializes in receiving electromagnet=

Here is some food for thought=
. I am currently reviewing my audio from our May 30th investigation.
=A0
It=
 was me and another girl teammate=A0present in the room. I picked up a 3rd =
female voice on my digital voice recorder that I carry with me. We were sta=
nding right next to another digital video recorder that I leave beside my n=
ight vision camera. That recorder did not pick up this 3rd voice. I have as=
ked the girl that was with me to check her recording to see if she picked i=
t up.
=A0
I have long felt the true EVP does not come from sound waves in t=
he environment, or then it wouldn't be EVP, but a disembodied voice. Someho=
w EVP's are appearing directly on the recordings.
=A0
This instance with th=
e recorders may back that theory up. That other recorder should have picked=
 that voice up if it were sound waves in the environment.
=A0
I am attachin=
g the clip of this 3rd voice. The=A0file that is named=A0"01-02-17 Clip" is=
 the full clip.=A0You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah", and then another =
comes in right after that. I think I know what it says.
=A0
Again, I was li=

ation.

I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an =

works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that di=

=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This=
 was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic sig=
nals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP were =
generated within a few inches of the recorder.
=A0
We are able to reproduce=
 this affect in not only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with a=
