Frank R.,
 
Once again pal, we are on apposing sides.
As far as Babs havin=
g many friends here
 
Welllll???
 
Anyway I want to address the subject of =
removing time from a file.
The way I am understanding what you mean by remo=
ving time is to
cut segments of the recording out of the file.
 
I myself d=
o cut out simple noise or static fragments that are naturally occurring in =
the sweep of the box
for instance the minibox has an inherent hum or thump =
as it's Creator calls it.
 
When I receive a response through the minibox i=
t will go something like this "yes HUM Bruce HUM we HUM are HUM here HUM"
I=
 will definitely remove every HUM from between the words but that does not =
change the message or affect the words that are spoken.
I'm assuming that i=
s what you are talking about when you and babs mention "removing time" 
 
I=
'm just guessing but maybe babs is trying to insinuate that researchers her=
e are altering their files., 
If so maybe she should be looking for that in=
 her own back yard. There must be someone she knows for a fact that is
alte=
ring communications.
 
And mike please lets not turn this into a whole big =
thing!

Very good observation Babs. Let me say that you have m=
any friends and associates here just for the simple fact that you have an i=
nterest in ITC, are a researcher and a complex thinker. I think we have sho=

u make a lot of good points in your post and I would like to know who remov=
es time from their recordings. I have never removed time from my recordings=
 and see no reason why anyone else would without saying so in an accompanie=
d post.I have limited experience with the 12-469's as a single piece of equ=
ipment. I have arranged mine per Mike's, "Spiricomp" design. I have 3, 12-4=
69's feeding a four channel mixer, which goes into a laptop running DC6 wit=
h Soundsoap 2. Mine scan equally spaced on the FM band. I have had pretty g=
ood results until recently.At first the messages were pretty clear but I ha=
d a feeling I was getting a different group than I normally have for the la=
st few years. When I would ask about my friends on the other side they woul=
d tell me they will look for them. Well about 2 weeks ago the 12-469 arrang=
ement started generating a lot of interference and feedback. I started hear=

 but voices made of static (metallic and robotic). They were breaking throu=

 "your method sucks". I have not used the 12-469's since because of the cle=

an I have given up on the 12-469's but I won't use them again until I am pe=

1 AMSubject: [EVP-ITC] Babs has Issues!

Alright, you all know I'm vocal an=
d I haven't made any "friends" herebut, if we can put that aside for a mome=
nt...Spirit communication has been my passion since day one, a little over6=
 years ago. I am a believer in the afterlife and a believer inspirits attem=
pting to communicate with us for a variety of reasons. Ihave spiritual beli=
efs that I feel strongly about and devote much ofmy waking (and sleeping) m=
oments to thoughts about this field.However, I am also a researcher and a s=
keptic. In order for me toallow ideas to become part of my reality I must e=
xperiment. In orderfor me to believe something is paranormal I HAVE to rule=
 out all otherpossible causes. That being said, I have some questions. My h=
ope isthat there are some here willing to enter into discussion with me.I h=
ave a difficult time with many of the files here. Many times, thereis no qu=
estion included in the file. I can not determine whether ornot the "reply" =
is an intelligent reply. Maybe this has to do withallowable file size.Some =
of the files I have been able to download. (I don't always keepmy email set=
tings on for this group as I get too many - lol) When Ilook at the file I s=
ee problems. There will be complete flat linesilence between the words. Man=
y times the "reply" is also at the samedecibel as the question askers voice=
. Those two things should notoccur naturally considering the devices being =
used. That tells me thatthere is manipulation of the files. Now, what is ma=
nipulation to me,may not be manipulation to others. To me, any altering of =
the recordedfile constitutes manipulation. I do not know if the reply wasin=
telligent or manipulated to be intelligent. Some say that they simply remov=
e the "no response" time. I've beentold it can be as much as 18 seconds rem=
oved from between words. Nowwe run into the problem of us deciding what wor=
d fits in with thequestion. What words are being ignored? Did we take nonse=
nse and makesense? Did we amp every noise/word or only what fit?I think it'=
s great that files are offered for peer review. However, Ithink we have to =
load them untouched or at the very least, offerexactly what was done to the=
 entire file. Time elapsed between words,what was amped, etc. I'd also love=
 to see some of these sessions videotaped with the question asker facing th=
e camera and a second handclock visible. Truly, we aren't researching if we=
 don't have someprotocol in place.Here is an issue I have with the RS Hacks=
. I have the 469. It takesapproximately 18 seconds to scan through the AM f=
requencies. Now, thetypical person would think that we can take that 18 sec=
onds and divideit by the number of AM stations to determine how long we are=
 on eachstation before moving on to the next one. In that way we coulddeter=
mine what is impossible to be said via a radio fragment. However,that's not=
 correct. The scan cycle can vary from one frequency to thenext and of cour=
se the biggest problem is that some stations arepicked up over multiple fre=
quencies; AM 640 can be heard on 630, 640,650, 660 and maybe even 670. That=
 extends the time a great deal. Thisis a difficult problem because it is al=
most impossible for the averageperson to be able to make a determination on=
 time this way. I heard about the following today; An experimenter records =
at the sametime every day Mon-Fri. We hear about the importance of meditati=
ng,automatic writing, etc at the same time every day but what we have torem=
ember with this, is that now we are in essence tuning into the sameradio sh=
ow every day. One of my first experiments with the 469 had mehearing this d=
eep male voice over and over again. What was he tryingto tell me, I wondere=
d. Than I realized that he was speakingapproximately every 18 seconds; ever=
y time the scan hit that station.So, if you are removing up to 18 seconds b=
etween words, then you arereally only recording the words from one station.=
 This post is IN NO WAY trying to start anything besides discussionabout so=
me research problems. I know that there are those who are notconcerned with=
 anything more than the communication itself but I thinkthat it is of the u=
tmost importance to attempt to factor in someprotocol in order for this to =
be considered serious research at all.
