      Yes, the old "demon chasing" crap, once again=
. 

      I brought the following thought up elsewhere and will bring it up=
 
      here for consideration, too. If ghosts are coming through the box 
=
      and thus are not in a good state of mind, how come on Paranormal 
   =
   State CM was willing to believe the message given by the ghost via 
    =
  the box as being truth (The ghost via the box said a "demon" was 
      h=
olding the ghosts captive there)? 

      I would suggest that perhaps a gh=
ost (assuming we are talking about a 
      disembodied person who remains =
earthbound) is not in a healthy state 
      of mind one would consider "st=
able," but trapped in emotional trauma 
      of some sort. Thus, how relia=
ble could the message of a ghost then 
      be? ;)
