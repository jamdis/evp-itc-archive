She\neventually began recording to tape and founded the AA-EVP in &#39;82.\n\nSarah also spoke of using evp methods to contact beings who live on\nother planets as well as in worlds that were invisible to us but just\nas real. \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jules&quot; &lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sorry to say that Sarah Estep&#39;s has passed away.  She will be\n&gt; missed by all and especially by all in the paranormal community.
