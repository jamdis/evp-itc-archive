<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>No, i get too much signal where i&#x27;m at.  I heard everything so clear 
yesterday, but today not so much.  I rush a session during the week, 
but hope to get better stuff tomorrow on my only day off from work.  
I wish i had more time to devote to this.

&gt; Steve,
&gt;  
&gt; Really rough, I can say I only heard one file clearly, the second 
one.
&gt; you must be getting a bad signal.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Seems Yahoo isn&#x27;t letting anyone play the files that we post, so 
i&#x27;ve attached them to this e-mail.
&gt;  
&gt; Files:
&gt;  
&gt; &quot;Bless You&quot;---That&#x27;s what i heard and was pretty funny and polite 
for them to say that.
&gt;  
&gt; &quot;It&#x27;s For Steve&quot;---No question was asked before this message
&gt;  
&gt; &quot;Lisa&quot;---&quot;Yeah&quot;---&quot;Maybe it&#x27;s supposed to be hard&quot;---This ones a 
little rough, but i hear it
&gt;  
&gt; &quot;Punk&quot;---&quot;Blake&quot;-&quot;Blake&quot;---&quot;His Face&quot;------Blake is a guy i work 
with who is helping me develop some new stuff, it&#x27;s funny that they 
mentioned him.  Blake is not a common name to be mentioned on the 
radio either.
&gt;  
&gt; &quot;Purple&quot;---&quot;Marcus&quot;---&quot;Chris&quot;---&quot;Chris&quot;---&quot;Beavis Hicks&quot;----I 
screwed up most of the names in real time, but i&#x27;m only human.  The 
upside is that the files are getting longer, meaning better 
conversations.  Maybe frank knows a beavis hicks.
&gt;  
&gt; &quot;You car&#x27;s still running&quot;---I did this 5 minute session while 
getting ready for work this morning and my car was outside running to 
warm up.  I guess they picked up on that.  This file is a little 
rough as well.
&gt;  
&gt; _____________
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; I also included the two from Frank&#x27;s video that were very clear 
messages.
&gt;  
&gt; &quot;Where&#x27;s Purple&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re friggin&#x27; People&quot;
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Hope you can make out some of these,
&gt;  
&gt; -Steve H.
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; p.s. Hang tight for the second set of files.  I have one nerve left 
and Yahoo is jumping on it like a trampoline.  I can only send a 
couple at a time.
