Recently Ive been trying the ST method first then \ncontinue on into the water method. For some reason the voices are \nvery loud after the ST session ends and the radio is shut down. And \na few say they prefer the water over the radio for speech. Others \nprefer the radio static. Not sure why exactly.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Misty"}
