Over last weekend the owner of a famous Illinois haunted location (the release of the movie is not due out until later this year).  The owner requested that my organization bring the box to the house.  So upon this request, myself, Joel, Jeff and Nancy brought several of the boxes to help assist the owner in some unanswered historical questions.  This session was amazing!  Although I can not disclosure the name of the location our little session may just be the exposure that the other side wants.  We will be turning our findings over to the owner and production company, and who knows, the box just may make its debut on the big screen.
   
  I would love your input on the attached files before I send them on.  I have many and have additional sessions still left to review.  
   
  I thank you all in advance for you help and assistance!
