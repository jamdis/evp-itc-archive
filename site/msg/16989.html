<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have yet to even witness the planchette move on it&#x27;s own accord.

I have conducted experiments using my gadgets - EMF, Temp gauges, Recording
devices...I have yet to get a single hit on any one of those devices during
a Ouija session, even when I have asked the &quot;entity&quot; to do so, to which it
always agrees.

I would agree with John and others. I think it is far more plausible that
the Ouija board is nothing more then us talking to ourselves. But again, I
am always open to the opportunity to be proven wrong.

&gt;&gt;  I have to ask--How much experience do you have using the quija board,
&gt;&gt; and/or other methods?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  There is no shortage of people that give their opinions on how these
&gt;&gt; communications work, there is a shortage of people that honestly understand.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Yes, you can get get operator influence with any of these methods, but it
&gt;&gt; seems too tempting for the skeptic/debunker to throw all out as if it&#x27;s all
&gt;&gt; explained. Could it be that you own mind has access to levels you are not
&gt;&gt; aware of, perhaps spiritual contacts, or higher levels of being?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I think it&#x27;s a bit of everything, there is external contact, and there is
&gt;&gt; some of just the mind talking to itself through these methods. I have always
&gt;&gt; said you have to be careful that you don&#x27;t create the evidence you are
&gt;&gt; looking for, but I am conveniently ignored.

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  As has been said, one of  the most likely explanations for the Ouija is
&gt;&gt;&gt; the working of the mind.
&gt;&gt;&gt; What is somewhat at issue, as is so often the case when discussing
&gt;&gt;&gt; apparent discarnate
&gt;&gt;&gt; communications, is the actual source of the apparent intelligence.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Micromuscular reactions do indeed appear to be one source of the Ouija
&gt;&gt;&gt; when operators are
&gt;&gt;&gt; in contact with the planchette. But this is only one category of Ouija
&gt;&gt;&gt; interactions. There is
&gt;&gt;&gt; another completely different category where no operator is touching the
&gt;&gt;&gt; board or the planchette,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and yet it moves and remains in motion, often changing directions or
&gt;&gt;&gt; flying off the board. This
&gt;&gt;&gt; type of activity is more akin to psychokinesis, the mind affecting the
&gt;&gt;&gt; environment.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Both types of activity could be mediated in the mind of a living
&gt;&gt;&gt; operator, and in fact modern
&gt;&gt;&gt; parapsychology research suggest this is the most reasonable explanation.
&gt;&gt;&gt; But again the
&gt;&gt;&gt; source of the information thus presented is at question and is currently
&gt;&gt;&gt; unknown.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Against this backdrop it would seem that it would be quite difficult to
&gt;&gt;&gt; demonstrate with
&gt;&gt;&gt; any clarity or precision that any specific individual (living or
&gt;&gt;&gt; deceased) was indeed affecting
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Ouija (or any other device for that matter). It would all come down
&gt;&gt;&gt; to beliefs which is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; best we can hope for at this time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; So &#x27;scientific&#x27; proof per se is off the table if you define &#x27;scientific&#x27;
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the classic sense.
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you mean objective proof, in some way documenting activity such as by
&gt;&gt;&gt; video for example,
&gt;&gt;&gt; that is a different matter. But to be very clear, this would not be
&gt;&gt;&gt; considered scientific proof
&gt;&gt;&gt; because you are cannot demonstrate the causation. You can however
&gt;&gt;&gt; document the effect.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Blood Mary (the ritual of Mary Worth) is considered by most to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; folk-legend. So it would
&gt;&gt;&gt; be difficult, would it not, to ascertain who in fact you were
&gt;&gt;&gt; communicating with. And again,
&gt;&gt;&gt; there is a real possiblity, based on existing lab research from the past
&gt;&gt;&gt; many decades that
&gt;&gt;&gt; you just might be communicating with yourself.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Best of luck in your endeavors!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I am doing some research on the Bloody Mary ritual and Ouija Boards. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; am
&gt;&gt;&gt; looking for anyone with stories or experiences from those that would be
&gt;&gt;&gt; willing  to share them - as well as any research and evidence you may
&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; gathered from  them. I am looking to bring the folklore together with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; history, science and  experience.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks.

As has been said, one o    he mos likely explana ions o he Ouija is he wo king o he mind.
Wha is somewha a issue, as is so o en he case when discussing appa en disca na e

Mic omuscula eac ions do indeed appea o be one sou ce o he Ouija when ope a o s a e

ano he comple ely di e en ca ego y whe e no ope a o is ouching he boa d o he planche e,

sou ce o he in o ma ion hus p esen ed is a ques ion and is cu en ly unknown.
 
Agains his backd op i would seem ha i would be qui e di icul o demons a e wi h
any cla i y o p ecision ha any speci ic indi idual (li ing o deceased) was indeed a ec ing

So &#x27;scien i ic&#x27; p oo pe se is o he able i you de ine &#x27;scien i ic&#x27; in he classic sense.
I you mean objec i e p oo , in some way documen ing ac i i y such as by ideo o example,
