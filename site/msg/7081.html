&gt;  A couple voices from just now testign another car tuner. I have 
veryu few
&gt; of these, and out of four I had in the junk box, only two work. 
These are
&gt; weak, almost like regular EVP. Rigel is one that comes through 
every once in
&gt; awhile, not sure if that his name, or home, as sometimes he 
says &quot;this is
&gt; your friend from Rigel&quot;
&gt;  
&gt;  It&#x27;s still looking like the sound chamber is completely un needed, 
and may
&gt; even hamper the voices. What I get form the Ghostman, and even 
directly from
&gt; a tuenr module is easier to understand that the ones through an 
sound
&gt; chamber and mic amplifiers. the Gostman in direct mode yields 
longs, and
&gt; more coherent voices than the original box, at least compared to 
what I was
&gt; getting last night.
&gt; Tonight I&#x27;ll modifiy #32 to get either direct recordings out of the 
tuner,
&gt; or through the sound chamber so I can compare.  I had one from 
2/5/08 from
&gt; the Ghostman that said &quot;that Earthquake will occur-------on the 
island near
&gt; Chile (Falklands?).  There was a EQ today off Brazil, but no island 
there.
&gt;  
&gt;  DRV=direct radio voice
