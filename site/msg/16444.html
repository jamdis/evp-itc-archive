Hi Brian,

I am a paranormal investigator and have been working extensively=
 in the field for 9 years now. My research team has been around for going o=
n 3 years now and have been through some 23 cases. Not one of those cases h=
as reported that activity increased after we were there. In fact, quiet the=
 opposite has occurred. In a few our cases, people have reported that after=
 attempts to communicate with the spirit, activity has decreased.

IMO, whi=
le I can't say it is impossible, I believe it would be very rare for activi=
ty to increase just because you tried to communicate.

As far as friends an=
d family, I learned along time ago not to care about what other people thin=
k. People will believe what they want to believe, and that shouldn't keep y=
ou from pursuing anything you feel important to you.

That being said, when=
 asked, I just quote the facts as I know them - 

1. There is no proof that=
 ghosts are demons.

2. Ghosts do not physically hurt people.

3. They rare=
ly attach themselves to you and even rarer still, follow you home.

4. Ther=
e is way more to fear from living beings than dead ones.

I hope this helps=
 a little.

Take care,
April

  Hello all,

  First p=
ost. I want to get started with this stuff, and figured the best place woul=
d be EVP. I got an IC recorder and am ready to go. I have a few questions t=
hough.

  At my friend's house there is *something* that likes to make nois=
es when it knows you can hear it. It'll make big loud footsteps and general=
ly try to scare the crap out of you. It would seem like a good place to sta=
rt buuuuut I don't know if attempting to communicate with it will make thin=
gs worse. Good idea? Bad idea? Does it matter?

  I really wanted to tryout=
 that allophone + EVPMaker combo that seems to be generating some good resu=
lts. EVP voices are so faint it's incredibly hard for me to make them out a=
t this point.

  Lastly, how do you deal with family and relatives that dis=
approve of this stuff? I live alone (well, with a roommate) and they seem t=
o think I'm getting into some sort of voodoo or sorcery or something. They =
seem to think that the voices are all demons or something. I don't know how=
 to explain it to them, I wish I could get them to understand. I am general=
ly a curious person so it was only a matter of time before I actually start=
ed with this stuff.

  Thanks for reading! :)
