<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi everyone I hadn&#x27;t a chance to introduce myself. My name is Vanesa. I am an avid fan of ghost hunting. I have tried different methods in obtaining EVPs. The one way that has worked for me is through a recorder or the &quot;white noise&quot; method using a radio with an external microphone. But I&#x27;ve always wanted to try using a &quot;box.&quot; The other day I had a paranormal experience happen. My dad is on the other side he occasionally pays me a visit and his face showed on my television whether the lights were turned on or off or all the windows were blocked from the sun. It was interesting. I took a picture of it. But I feel like the picture wasn&#x27;t good enough to record the moment when it happened. It looks a tad bit distorted and you can barely make out the face the way I saw it anyway. Nice to meet everyone though. I do manage to read most of what is posted though interesting topics.</pre>
