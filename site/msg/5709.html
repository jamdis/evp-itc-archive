<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>About a 3rd of the way from the start I can hear a woman says &quot;I 
don&#x27;t see--Frank&quot;, and there&#x27;s some other english words, but can&#x27;t 
quite make them out into a message.

&gt; I just uploaded a 45 sec sample of a session with evp maker.  I 
recorded a spanish language tv program and processed it through 
evpmaker.  I am including 45 seconds of a 2:45 min session so that 
anyone in the group might comment on the quality of the recording.  I 
have been getting zero results...that I can hear...maybe I am doing 
something wrong technically.  Maybe I am not hearing right.  Any 
opinions or comments would be appreciated.  Ron L
