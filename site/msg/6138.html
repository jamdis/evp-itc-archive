<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Those are excellent recordings Bruce.  Most of them are very clear. 
The one about St. Patrick sounds like &quot;That&#x27;s St. Patrick&quot; to my ears.

&gt; That&#x27;s a lot of files.  I&#x27;ll have to listen to them in a little bit. 
&gt; It&#x27;s funny you mention St. Patrick.  I recently found out that one of
&gt; my ancestors was king of Ireland and was killed by St. Patrick because
&gt; he would not convert.  Changed my whole view on St. Patty&#x27;s day.

&gt; &gt; hey everyone,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I had a really terrific session recently and posted a bunch of
files. I 
&gt; &gt; hope you guy&#x27;s don&#x27;t get bored listening 99% of them are great.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I received 5 concerning Sarah  Estep and believe a couple where Sarah 
&gt; &gt; herself.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also got one Claiming to be St. Patrick.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I labeled a couple with explanations, something new to explain
what the 
&gt; &gt; file is about.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I hope you guy&#x27;s can give a listen these files are really good.
