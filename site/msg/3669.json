I personally know Chris and think he&#39;s a \ngreat guy and frank feels the same way most days.  This has gotten \nto the point where i can&#39;t even do a session anymore because i&#39;m so \nblocked by negative thoughts from this group it&#39;s pointless to \nconcentrate on the box and get results.  Honestly who cares what \nchris does anyway, does it really affect everyone&#39;s lives that \nmuch.  I have a job and this is a hobby that i used to really like, \nbut now this board has brought me down.  It seems all people want to \ndo is make this like a street fight with challenges and negative \nviews and for what reason?  If anyone is concerned about hearing \nChris&#39;s audio, i have about 2 hours of box sessions from Eastern \nState on my web site for all to listen to.  It&#39;s \nwww.keyportparanormal.com and go to investigation and click on \neastern state.  All the audio is at the bottom of that page and you \nguys can judge for yourself and i heard a lot come out of that box \nthat night personally because i repeated a lot of stuff back to \nchris that i heard.  Enough already, let&#39;s move on to the next great \nthing.  That radio shack hack was a great breakthrough here, let&#39;s \njust be happy we got that before it was shut down.  Now we have \nanother avenue to go down, but we can&#39;t do it with all these \nnegatives out there.  Let&#39;s move on to new topics and anyone out \nthere that bought a Radio Shack box, start sharing your files with \nthe group so it&#39;s not just us same 5 that post all the time.\n\n-Steve H."}
