Unfortunately Mr Wegrzyn, your threats to me constitute criminal harassment=
.=C2=A0 
Here's what you said:

"Get off Franks back...Or I'll find you and=
 you dont want that...get with
 it or GET LOST...Thats my opion,let me know=
 Frank and I'll take a road 
trip.I got laid off today and I'm in the mood =
to screw something or 
someone up !!!!!"

Mr Wegrzyn. did you mean that thr=
eat? I am considering filing a police report, but I am willing to give you =
a chance to reexplain what you meant, or take it back, since as you said, y=
ou did get laid off and all.
