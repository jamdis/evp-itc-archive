For a $1 listing fee, and no  hassles of buying product in \n&gt; advance then \n&gt; having to ship, that would be  totally worth it. Unlimited downloads (for how \n&gt; long can you \n&gt; list - 9  days?) would reach a heck of a lot more people than selling units \n&gt; at cost.  :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) ,  \n&gt; &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; opps I  mean:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can someone send me the written instructions on how to  hack the 12-\n&gt; &gt; 469!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kay\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---  In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) ,  \n&gt; &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I checked to  see what it would cost to sell one of ebay. To list \n&gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  it is $1.00 for $25.00-449.00 plus 8.75% of the initial $25.00 \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  ($2.19), plus 3.50% of the remaining closing value balance ($25.01 \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; to $1,000.00)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would be willing  to list the one I have plus give the \n&gt; &gt; information \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the  free hacking and that fact that you can get one at Radio \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shack  for $24.99 just to shut this guy down.

You could then list them just like the ones that  are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; selling...so they pull up identical to the listings  that are up \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there. :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  LC\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) ,  \n&gt; &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was thinking if someone would list a  FREE DOWNLOAD of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instructions for the various hacks  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the Radio Shack units, it could put an end to the  business \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sellers that are taking \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; advantage of people who are unaware that they could probably  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hack \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the units for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  themselves. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen  &quot;downloads&quot; of various things listed before.
