I hear different people proposing different mechanisms by which EVP operate=
s.=A0 Some say it uses the words in radio transmissions, and anyone can hea=
r it if they listen.=A0 Some say it uses the disturbance or energy of radio=
 transmissions to form new words, but it is harder to hear (some say you ha=
ve to be "chosen" to hear it).=A0 Some say it can use any transmission,=A0 =
and can even be seen in video.=A0 Some say it doesn't require any transmiss=
ion, and can be extracted from white noise, or no noise.=A0 Some say it can=
 be heard even in things like running water.

So it depends on which theory=
 this person is testing.=A0 If he were testing the claim that the EVPs requ=
ired a radio broadcast, then this test wouldn't be good, since the Faraday =
cage should block the radio needed. If he is testing the one where people c=
laim that words appear on a radio or recording device that have not been tr=
ansmitted, then this sounds like a reaonsable test to me.=A0
