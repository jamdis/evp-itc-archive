<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The tuner is *the most critical component.*  I have not been able to build
usable home made tuners, the problem being they are extrmemly noisy when
swept.  This problem prevents me from any serious production. I do make a
TRF tuner based on the MK484 chip, and that type of reciever eleiminates
almost all the static normally found on the AM band, but it doesn&#x27;t have the
selectivity of super hets, so broadcast fragments tend to be longer,
with the &quot;voices&quot; seemingly in between the fragments. With a fast sweep
though, at times they will use all the audio and modualate a voice into it.

 I use digital radios I pick up at Thrift strores, as well as the tuners
from the Radio Shack radios.

 The sweep is little more than the triangle function from a funtion
generator, I add a DC offset and amp so I can cover the entire AM and FM
bands of a given tuner.  I do use a random sweep, but so far that is a real
pain in the butt to make it run consistently, but I think I have a solution.


 For store bought tuners you have to use a sope or meter and find all the
powere=, band change and tuning voltage inputs before removing it from the
main unit. After removing the tuner test sweep it with a 9 volt battery and
100k pot to see how noisy it is as it&#x27;s swept, and to determine the tuning
voltage range.

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I have watched the forum here and not really participated a whole lot until
&gt; now. The boxes have always been an interest to me, especially after a
&gt; demonstration by Steve Hultay. I have been using a Shack Hack he gave me
&gt; with some good success but I want to go the next level and build a box. I
&gt; have an electrical engineer who is going to work with me and I was wondering
&gt; where the best place to start would be. I have run across the schematics for
&gt; box #1 on-line but know that there have been numerous upgrades and changes
&gt; since then - not certain what number you&#x27;re at now Frank but was wondering
&gt; where the best place to start would be and are there any schematics
&gt; available of the later generations of the box available for us to expand
&gt; upon?

The une is he mos c i ical componen .  I ha e no been able  o build usable home made une s, he p oblem being hey a e ex memly noisy when swep .  This p oblem p e en s me om any se ious p oduc ion.
