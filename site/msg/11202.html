Al,

This is the only recorder i have ever used and the audio is above all 
the rest.  A bit expensive, but worth it.  I originally bought it to 
record my jam sessions with my band and than this research came along 
and i already had it.  So that&#x27;s what i used, i&#x27;ve even caught some 
real evp with it.

&gt; Al,
&gt; 
&gt; I use the Roland Edirol r-09, it has a SD slot and works really 
well 
&gt; for me.

&gt; &gt; Hi Al,
&gt; &gt; Do you know if there is a digital voice recorder that has an SD 
&gt; card slot? That would be nice to switch SD cards from time to time. 
&gt; Especially if one had a great EVP. 
&gt; &gt; How does listening to EVP&#x27;s make you feel about the dead? This is 
&gt; not meant to be a theological argument in any way. Just a 
&gt; question...I am a medium, and I approach the subject as a medium. 
But 
&gt; then I am involved with being a medium daily. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Al, thank YOU for your honest and kind reply. I appreciate your 
&gt; taking the time out of your busy day to reply to me. The time and 
&gt; effort does not make typing easy for you. 
&gt; &gt; Blessings,
&gt; &gt; (The Other...) Al
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Al, this is the other Al, heh. I like the Olympus and have three 
of 
&gt; them and one Sony. IMHO the Olympus beats Sony hands down. Model WS-
&gt; 300M is my favorite. I believe it runs 24-hours -- I use it for 
&gt; overnight evps in houses and have captured very clear sounds. It is 
&gt; stereo and snaps apart to convert into a memory stick complete with 
&gt; usb. You can store data/text files and music, and the tiny speaker 
is 
&gt; excellent. This thing is so light a good Cuban cigar weighs more. I 
&gt; believe these go for $150 or so, but I got this one new on ebay for 
&gt; $65. Another good one I use all the time is Olympus VN-960PC, which 
&gt; may not be in mfg. any more. It records about 16 hours and is 
&gt; slightly larger, but has a darn good mike and I like the clip for 
the 
&gt; shirt pocket. Also it has a lighted display (as does the ws-300m) 
&gt; thhat&#x27;s larger than the other one, consequently with bigger figures 
&gt; for easier reading. You didn&#x27;t ask for this, but the one I&#x27;d avoid 
is 
&gt; the Sony icd-st25. The sound is nowhere near true and though it has 
&gt; most of the features of the Olympus models the sound quality is 
first 
&gt; in my book. I think all of these are available at wally world, 
&gt; costco, and circuit city, though you can usually save a lot at ebay 
&gt; if you&#x27;re patient.
