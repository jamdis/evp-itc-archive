No I said another trooper corrected me saying it was a "Signal" 7 not "Code=
" 10-7 and that not all police departments use the same system here or else=
where.

While some codes are used differently, many are used the same.
All the 10 c=
ode references I've found indicate a 10-7 is an out of service.
Can you poi=
nt to a reference that shows a different meaning?

Tonight at work I was talking to a st=
ate trooper, there had been an accident. I asked him if there were any deat=
hs (it was very very bad) and he said he didnt know so he got on his radio =
and called in and asked them if it was a 7 at the site. They told him negat=
ive, and he told me the little boy who was the worst off was still alive. I=
 asked him why did you ask them if it was a 7. He said code 7, I was asking=
 them if they were dead. So if you ever hear anyone call 7 over the radio t=
hat means someones dead.
=A0
Just thought I would pass that on. I find it i=
nteresting since I know alot of us have heard this before when used to desc=
ribe who is speaking rather than a name they say seven.
