<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank,

I was just giving my opinion on what i heard that&#x27;s all.  I didn&#x27;t 
mean to offend you in any way, you do a great job at developing the 
equipment.  I just thought this yahoo board was about telling each 
other what we hear in the posted files.  Now that i see how sensitive 
you are, i will no longer comment on your files.  

Sorry,
-Steve H.

&gt; &quot;Frank, The files i heard clearly was the &quot;Frank, i&#x27;m 
talking&quot;and &quot;Thank you, princess&quot;. The other i heard &quot;He&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;The 
Voltage&quot;, but didn&#x27;t catch the &quot;Checking&quot; part. All in all, sounds 
like a &quot;Frank&#x27;s Box&quot; to me. Although boxes automate the raw 
material....&quot;
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve said since day one--they use what we use, and the 
box is not the only method, but maybe I can be pardoned, I forgot 
Steve is one of the 30, so in a unique postion to interpret, hear the 
voices, and tell us all what they really say! Interesting that there 
is always someone that has no technical knowledge whatsoever, and 
minimal expereince, but will proceed to tell the world how this stuff 
really works. 
&gt;
