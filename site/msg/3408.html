&gt; I guess that&#x27;s all that matters. Because I&#x27;m sure that groups will not
&gt; pool their 10 bucks a piece together, get a box, head into someones
&gt; home.... and who knows.
&gt;
&gt; Okay, I&#x27;m done. My opinions are clear. But, we all know about  
&gt; opinions...

&gt; &gt; I also meant to add that this mini-box is hardly going into mass
&gt; &gt; production. If you want one, you have to cough up $400-$500, just
&gt; &gt; like I just did. That fee alone is enough to deter casual users. The
&gt; &gt; people who buy these are not going to buy them on a whim.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#x27;s not that concerns are not considered, I think no one knows
&gt; &gt; &gt; what to do with it. There&#x27;s not enough box users, and ITC
&gt; &gt; &gt; researchers out there to really good feel for what the pitfalls
&gt; &gt; &gt; are. So far after seven years of EVP/ITC work I can say onlly that
&gt; &gt; &gt; these dark entities, or wahtever it is talk bad, and threaten, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; that&#x27;s about all they do. They threaten, I tell them to bring it,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and....nothin&#x27;! Paper tigers I say.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as some fears that portals are opened, and all kinds of
&gt; &gt; &gt; evil comes in, I don&#x27;t believe that either. They are already have
&gt; &gt; &gt; full access, they already exist in more demensions, making this
&gt; &gt; &gt; physical level about the lowest level of spiritual existence/
&gt; &gt; &gt; evolution. Just about all these worries are old fear crap to keep
&gt; &gt; &gt; people in church.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to with hold the stuff cuz of a few nut
&gt; &gt; &gt; jobs, you have the same problem with everything from bicycles to
&gt; &gt; &gt; airplanes.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I had that concern about selling my boxes, but how would you
&gt; &gt; &gt; screen users? You can&#x27;t. Not everyone can use a quija board, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; not too many unbalanced ding dongs get in trouble with those  
&gt; anyway.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Family hour around the radio
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am a fairly quiet person, most of the time. I have my  
&gt; thoughts and
&gt; &gt; &gt; opinions on topics but feel strongly about &quot;to each his own&quot;.  
&gt; Unless
&gt; &gt; &gt; something strikes me as completely wrong, I won&#x27;t debate. No  
&gt; one here
&gt; &gt; &gt; has heard from me other than recently with this mini-box yet, I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; here several times weekly reading and offering my energy in  
&gt; support of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the research.
&gt; &gt; &gt; However...something is striking me here and again, I can&#x27;t keep my
&gt; &gt; &gt; mouth shut. The discussion about the family hour with the box  
&gt; has led
&gt; &gt; &gt; the way for people to mention negativity and even &quot;the dark  
&gt; guys&quot; can
&gt; &gt; &gt; be fun if not taken seriously.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I ask you to consider the fact that many who purchase the mini-box
&gt; &gt; &gt; will not be of the right frame of mind. Most will not be in  
&gt; harmony.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Many will take &quot;the dark guys&quot; seriously. Yet, you feel it&#x27;s a  
&gt; good
&gt; &gt; &gt; idea to let anyone who wants a box have one? All in the name of
&gt; &gt; &gt; sharing technology.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I know that my previous posts expressing my concern over the mass
&gt; &gt; &gt; marketing of the box, was barely given consideration. Realize  
&gt; that I
&gt; &gt; &gt; am not being selfish- I do not own a box. EVP is my passion and  
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; &gt; been from day one 6 years ago when I jumped fully into the  
&gt; field. I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; successful in capturing EVP, always have been. I still do it  
&gt; the &quot;old
&gt; &gt; &gt; fashioned way&quot; with open air techniques. Would I love to be  
&gt; able to
&gt; &gt; &gt; hold real time 2 way communications with the other side? Of  
&gt; course.
&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I do not think enough research into the possibilities has
&gt; &gt; &gt; been done to warrant the approval let alone production of these  
&gt; boxes.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Those of us who have been on countless investigations with many  
&gt; people
&gt; &gt; &gt; will quickly admit that there are some people we&#x27;d rather not
&gt; &gt; &gt; investigate with. When they are present, negative things tend to
&gt; &gt; &gt; happen. We all know one or two people who we can say &quot;felt  
&gt; dark&quot; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; the first meeting. We all admit that being mentally sound is an
&gt; &gt; &gt; important quality in this field. If you have mental issues,  
&gt; this may
&gt; &gt; &gt; not be the area of research for you. We don&#x27;t bring children on
&gt; &gt; &gt; investigations for obvious reasons. BUT! If you want a box that  
&gt; could
&gt; &gt; &gt; possibly open up a portal and bridge the gap between here and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; dark, sure! Anyone who wants one should have it!
&gt; &gt; &gt; You might feel that I am over reacting or being overly dramatic.
&gt; &gt; &gt; That&#x27;s fine. My concern is not what you think of me but that you
&gt; &gt; &gt; consider the possibilities here. Many of which we do not know.  
&gt; Can you
&gt; &gt; &gt; be 100% sure that this is a good idea or that it&#x27;s worthy of  
&gt; saying
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;well, we&#x27;ll see what happens&quot;?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of negativity from my Frank&#x27;s box. Harmony is very important
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as is the right frame of mind before turning the box on.
