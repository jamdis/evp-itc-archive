They werent a secret and =\r\n\nshe knew I was using them and chose to stay and live with me anyways. \nI d=\r\nont refuse to accept what you say, so dont refuse to accept what I \nwrite. =\r\nI wont go into this anymore with you.\n\nI never said I was going to continue=\r\n this &quot;research&quot; at all. You \nobviously are just in a tunnel vision right n=\r\now because of one thing \nand I really dont see how your closed mind can eve=\r\nn be in this field. \nSo I guess I would offer the same advice to you becaus=\r\ne of what you \nhave also shared. \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, black b=\r\near hollow \n&lt;blackbearhollow@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone who goes to the insane=\r\n effort to put up spy equipment to \nwatch \n&gt; a girlfriend unbeknownst to he=\r\nr, and makes excuses for it, has \nsome \n&gt; serious issues - that&#39;s a fact ev=\r\nen if you refuse to accept it.\n&gt; \n&gt; But that has no place topic wise here. =\r\nI wasn&#39;t being sarcastic, I \nwas \n&gt; being honest.
