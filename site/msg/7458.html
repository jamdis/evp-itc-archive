 Years ago, with the first boxes, I used to wrap the tuner module with foi=
l, mistakenly thinking it needed a shield since it was in a metal car radio=
 frame-wrong! That caused some undisirable coupling in the radio circuits, =
introducing that buzzing noise. I woke up this morning, knowing what the ma=
lfunction was, and it took seconds to fix it. I think the techno droids tal=
k to me at night. 
 
 The tuner I was using for the most recent testing was=
 from old #3, which was plagued with the noise so bad, I used it parts--DOH=
!
 
 I tell everyone, ain't no genius! There's barely a functional brain in=
 this body!
