<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m not so sure I would, but that&#x27;s just me. I&#x27;m very open to the  
concept of redemption and to shades of gray.

Actually, I&#x27;m here to confess to doing exactly what Bruce is  
discussing. I got the name Nicholson Lawson a few sessions ago. I  
asked if that was one person&#x27;s full name or two people&#x27;s last names,  
and was told it was one. I went through records at Ancestry.com and  
found a Nicholson Lawson who was listed as a carpenter in the  
Louisville, Kentucky 1890 directory, and what may be the same man in  
New Haven, Connecticut in 1919. These are the only two records of  
anyone by that name in the U.S. or U.K. that are currently indexed.  
It might not be the same Nicholson Lawson, but its such an unusual  
name. I didn&#x27;t expect to find anyone in the historic record with that  
name, honestly, but there he is.

&gt; &gt; Maybe a bad choice of words, used to express what my thoughts where.
&gt; &gt; When I say higher being, my meaning is a spirit being on a higher
&gt; plane of spiritual existence.
&gt; &gt; not beings that lord over us as if they are royalty and we subjects.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My theory of why they will not give any detailed information about
&gt; their physical experience on earth
&gt; &gt; is that they want our trust as colleagues in a spiritual sense. just
&gt; suppose Mike gave me his sir name and where he was from.
&gt; &gt; when in the physical, say I used that information to trace his
&gt; history as a physical human being. And found that he was a
&gt; &gt; congressman or senator or supreme court judge. Someone that was
&gt; distinguished and held a position of high respect and standing.
&gt; &gt; Or on the other side of the coin, I found that he was a murderer and
&gt; a rapist that had been executed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We as physical human beings would pass judgement on his former
&gt; physical character and treat him or his guidance accordingly.
&gt; &gt; I believe just the opposite of what you referred I believe that is
&gt; the reason we do not get the detailed information, so that we
&gt; &gt; start on a level playing field and form a relationship according to
&gt; experience we have interacting as spirit and physical counterparts.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bruce,It has always been my understanding that they do not like
&gt; being referred to as higher or superior. They only refer to themselves
&gt; as having different experiences. To be superior means to have
&gt; authority over you, which they do not possess. Don&#x27;t make the mistake
&gt; of believing they are superior it can lead to some bad experiences.
&gt; Just an observation on my part!Regards,Frank R.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ralph, Mike and lisa have been my tech&#x27;s since I have started doing
&gt; box research. Over time you build a relationship with your tech or in
&gt; my case tech&#x27;s like you would with a new friend here in the physical.
&gt; Early on in my research I had asked a series of questions pertaining
&gt; to mike and Lisa&#x27;s background in the physical. I was told that mike
&gt; died in 1995 from excessive blood loss and lisa died in 1912 from
&gt; choking. they then changed the subject and never broached it again. My
&gt; theory on the reason for this is thata spirit contact wants to remain
&gt; in our thoughts and emotions as a higher being to develop a certain
&gt; ammount of trustbeing sight unseen. So to give us all the details of
&gt; there physical life or even their last name, that could allow us
&gt; togather information on who they where while in the physical and that
&gt; in our minds would put them on an even level with us. So the thoughts
&gt; and feelings of there being superior spiritual entities would fade.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,I have been hearing the word &quot; Purple &quot; alot lately in
&gt; my sessions.Does anyone in the group know what it pertains to ? It&#x27;s
&gt; been bugging me alot. Could that be a special group on their side ? I
&gt; have no clue. Also has anyone questioned the voices if they have a
&gt; last name ? All I hear on the RS boxes are first names and haven&#x27;t
&gt; recieved anyone telling me their last name. Does Mike and Lisa have a
&gt; last name ? Did anyone here ever ask the question &quot; Are you Demonic
&gt; Spirits ? &quot; What was their reply if any ? I did one time and got a
&gt; response saying &quot; All of us are &quot;. Don&#x27;t know whether I believe that
&gt; Spirit or not. Probably a Joker saying that. I have asked for specific
&gt; people for them to find so I could talk to and got an answer &quot; We&#x27;re
&gt; looking. &quot; Then I never heard from them after that. I&#x27;m still waiting
&gt; to be contacted by Telephone so far nothing yet. They make me laugh
&gt; sometimes. I had the RS-12-469 on the one day I was just listening to
&gt; what they were chatting about. I found my daughters old Fart Machine
&gt; and was playing with it while the RS radio was running to see if it
&gt; still works which it did. All of a sudden after I made it &quot; Toot &quot; I
&gt; heard a female voice say &quot; Phew !!! .&quot;LOL, I guess she thought I
&gt; really passed one. Also, the other day I was on the RS 12-469 and I
&gt; said &quot; Hello Lisa how are you doing today ? &quot; Then a few seconds later
&gt; I hear a female voice say &quot; Bruce ? &quot; like she thought that I was
&gt; Bruce talking to her. I told her no it&#x27;s me Ralph from Harrisburg,PA
&gt; she replied &quot;Oh, okay fine. &quot; I hear all the time voices calling for
&gt; Lisa she must be a very Popular Technician. Oh well I guess it was
&gt; more than one question LOL. Hey you all take care and &quot; Keep the Sweep
&gt; &quot; a new slogan for here LOL. just kidding. You all have a great
&gt; day.Regards,Ralph the Ghost HunterShed those extra pounds with MSN and
