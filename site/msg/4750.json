We could hear it in  \nperson at the time, and it sounded like &quot;get out.&quot; Once I pulled it  \ninto Audacity, it sounded completely different. Slowing it down 33%  \nmakes it sound even more different. Any guesses? I haven&#39;t done  \nanything to these files other than to slow the second version down a  \nbit.  Deb T"}
