According to Wikipedia, 1485 Khz is in the AM band region.=A0 I had thought=
 so but had to look it up.... really long time since my radio/antenna desig=
n days :)

Hi Mike,
My viewpoint on this is that 1485kHz was a frequency that=
 provided 
Jurgenson with one (of probably many) correct combinations of

at that=
 period in time, and at that location.
In chapter 24 of "Sprechfunk mit Ver=

that "Lena" used a special sound frequency=
 that she fashioned from 
the overlapping of certain sounds and which would=
 have sounded in 
most cases like a toneless, meaningless hissing.
Also he =
mentions that the "friends" were able to shape the sound 
frequencies of th=

sounds.
But most import=

I tend to conclude th=

frequencies he used that time,=
 but probably holds no specific 
relevance today, excepting if it is able t=
