<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey everyone. I went ahead and typed up all the text from the Voice to
Text training session. Unfortunately I could only copy and paste the
first two paragraphs, everything else was done the old fashioned way.
I won&#x27;t be able to do much with this since this is the last two weeks
of the semester and us college students have finals and papers due
(sigh). So I figured if anyone wants to take a whack at this, more
power to you.

In this step the computer listens to the sound of your voice and
adjusts the volume setting of your microphone. When the computer has
finished adjusting the volume, it beeps to signal that the process is
complete. If you reach the end of this text but you have not heard a
beep, start reading the text again from the beginning. You should only
have to read for about ten to fifteen seconds.

In this step the computer checks the audio input from your sound
system. Having high-quality audio input is very important for good
speech recognition. Poor audio input will make it difficult or
impossible for the program to recognize your speech accurately. When
the computer has finished checking the audio quality, it beeps to
signal that the test is complete. If you reach the end of this text
but you have not heard a beep, start reading the text again from the
beginning. You should only have to read for about fifteen seconds.

Welcome to general training

Training is about to begin

We would like you to read aloud for a few minutes while the computer
listens to you and learns how you speak. When you have finished
reading, we&#x27;ll make some adjustments, and then you will be able to
talk to your computer and see the words appear on your screen. In the
meantime, we would like to explain why talking to a computer is not
the same as talking to a person and then give you a few tips about how
to speak when dictating.

Understanding spoken language is something that people often take for
granted. Most of us develop the ability to recognize speech when we&#x27;re
very young. We&#x27;re already experts at speech recognition by the age of
three or so.

When people first start using speech-recognition software, they might
be surprised that the computer makes mistakes. Maybe unconsciously we
compare the computer to another person. But the computer is not like a
person. What the computer does when it listens to speech is different
from what a person does.

The first challenge in speech recognition is to identify what is
speech and what is just noise. People can filter out noise fairly
easily, which lets us talk to each other almost anywhere. We have
conversations in busy train stations, across the dance floor, and in
crowded restaurants. It would be very if we had to sit in a quiet room
every time we wanted to talk to each other!

Unlike people, computers need help separating speech sounds from other
sounds. When you speak to a computer, you should be in a place without
too much noise. Then, you must speak clearly into a microphone that
has been placed in the right position. If you do this, the computer
will hear you just fine, and not get confused by other noises around you.

A second challenge is to recognize speech from more than one speaker.
People do this very naturally. We have no problem chatting one moment
with Aunt Grace, who has a high, thin voice, and the next moment with
Cousin Paul, who has a voice like a foghorn. People easily adjust to
the unique characteristics of every voice.

Speech-recognition software, on the other hand, works best when the
computer has a chance to adjust to each new speaker. The process of
teaching the computer to recognize your voice is called &quot;training,&quot;
and it&#x27;s what you are doing right now.

The training process takes only a few minutes for most people. If,
after you begin using the program, you find that the computer is
making more mistakes that you expect, use the tools provided in the
Accuracy Center to improve the recognition accuracy.

Another challenge is how to distinguish between two or more phrases
that sound alike. People use common sense and context--knowledge of
the topic being talked about--to decide whether a speaker said &quot;ice
cream&quot; or &quot;I scream.&quot;

Speech-recognition programs don&#x27;t understand what words mean, so they
can&#x27;t use common sense the way people do. Instead, they keep track of
how frequently words occur by themselves and in the context of other
words. This information helps the computer choose the most likely
words or phrase from among several possibilities.

Finally, people sometimes mumble, slur their words, or leave words out
altogether. They assume, usually correctly, that their listeners will
be able to fill in the gaps. Unfortunately, computers won&#x27;t understand
mumbled speech or missing words. They only understand what was
actually spoken and don&#x27;t know enough to fill in the gaps by guessing
what was meant.

To understand what it means to speak both clearly and naturally,
listen to the way newscasters read the news. If you copy this style
when you dictate, the program should successfully recognize what you say,

One of the most effective ways to make speech recognition work better
is to practice speaking clearly and evenly when you dictate. Try
thinking about what you want to say before you start to speak. This
will help speak in longer, more natural phrases.

Speak at your normal pace without slowing down. When another person is
having trouble understanding you, speaking more slowly usually helps.
It doesn&#x27;t help, however to speak at an unnatural pace when you are
talking to a computer. This is because when matching sounds to words.
If you speak in syllables, each syllable is likely to be transcribed
as a separate word.

With a little practice, you will develop the habitat of dictating in a
clear, steady voice, and the computer will understand you better.

When you read this training text, the program adapts to the pitch and
volume of your voice. For this reason, when you dictate, you should
continue to speak at the pitch and volume you are speaking with right
now. If you shout or whisper when you dictate, the program won&#x27;t
understand you as well.

And last but not least, avoid saying extra words you really don&#x27;t want
in your document, like &quot;you know.&quot; The computer has no way of knowing
which words you say are important, so it simply transcribes everything
you say.

We hope you have enjoyed reading about the different ways that people
and computers recognize spoken language as well as some tips for
effective dictating.
