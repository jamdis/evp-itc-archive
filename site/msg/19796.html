<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Recorded from the headphone jack to digital recorder via attenuator cable.
&quot;Nice ghost box&quot; in AM Boosted at 9 seconds, and at 30 seconds &quot; How are
ya--good, plenty of oxygen&quot;--weird. I thought it was a frag, except for the
content. The attenuator cable has a 10K resistor in series with each channel
from the head phone jack, the 10ks tie together to add the left and right
channels together, that feeds an attenuator made of a 39K resistor, and a
470 ohm resistor to ground to bring the headphone level down to a mic level
for the recorder. Without the attenuator, you either have to record from the
speaker, or get severe distortion from signal clipping by overloading the
mic input of the recorder. That whooosing sound is this going over the heads
of the average ghost hunter. I think if people want decent EVP recordings,
they should know something about the technical aspects of actually
recording. Learn what a line level is and how to use it, not the kind used
by carpenters!
