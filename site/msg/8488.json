I think our perceptions and expectations really have tremendous influence on \nour experiences.  &quot;The Experimenter Effect&quot; so to speak.  I would venture to guess, that \nprior to taking on any kind of box, someone had already planted the notion in your mind \nthat the box/radio is a portal of sorts and you conducted your session accordingly.  I find \nthat those in spirit are more than willing to go along with whatever frame of reference we \nare using.  I often suspect, that in some ways, we are making up the guidelines for their \ncommunication with us, and they comply.  \n\nIf your belief is that you have opened a portal, then ask questions based on that belief (ie:  \nare you back on your side? or things along that line) then they will answer accordingly.  \nThey typically don&#39;t respond with questions like &quot;what are you talking about?&quot;  ;0)  \n\nI purposefully limited my exposure to the multitudes of opinions floating around \ncyberspace until I had worked for many months with various sweeps, and for the most \npart had formed my own opinions based solely on my personal experiences.  Only then \ndid I venture out to see what others might be saying. \n\nI will say, as common courtesy would have it, I do officially close my sessions by saying \nthings like, &quot;OK, I&#39;m going to listen now.  Thanks for talking.  If you have anything left to \nsay, please do it now, you have XX seconds.&quot;  (10, 20, 30, whatever, timewise)  Then I turn \noff the recorder, the box, the radio, or whatever I&#39;m using.  I have done this since day one \njust because I&#39;ve always thought of EVP communication as being similar to talking with \nsomeone in the room, or on the phone.  As with any conversation, it&#39;s deserving of a \nproper closure of some sort.\n\nOne thing I did find that is absolutely spot on with many other&#39;s experiences is, that there \nappears to be technical people helping us.  But I had long ago come to this conclusion, \nway before any sweep experimentation came into the picture for me,  because in my \ntraditional EVP work I was getting technical messages.  \n\nI didn&#39;t hear the rest of your clip as clearly as the end, but I *totally* know what you mean \nabout how something can be so clear to you but not to others.  I think this is just part of \nthe mystery of EVP, sweep, etc.  Perhaps some of it is a telepathic connection of sort to our \ncommunicators, and also likely to contribute to the differences is that we are all using \ncountless combinations of computer hardware/software, speakers, etc.  \n\nI once conducted an experiment where I burned 10 or so EVP&#39;s to CD.  I then used that \nsame CD in various systems.  I was absolutely stunned at the difference it sometimes \nmade.  Even on the same system, using different software applications can cause \nexamples to be heard slightly differently. But in some cases, the difference was dramatic \nfrom one system combination to the next.  \n\nI suspect one reason for this is, when we are conducting our sessions, the communication \nis being given in a way that it is optimized for that particular hardware/software setup.  Of \ncourse, the higher the clarity of original message content to begin with, the less influence \nsystem variations will have on other&#39;s abilities to hear an example as we are.  Likewise, I \nbelieve it is possible that the communication could even be tailored to our particularly \nhearing.  We all have different ranges of hearing and sounds that are better, or less, suited \nto those ranges.  \n\nOK, I&#39;m way off on a rambling spell here.  It&#39;s like my fingers have a life of their own when \nI&#39;m at the keyboard sometimes!!  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kristin Morris&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Margaret.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your answer resonates with me but I kinda think of the portal as more of a\n&gt; light in the sense that when I begin using the technology they become\n&gt; attracted to me like a moth to a flame.  So I am opening a portal in a sense\n&gt; - not literal but more like a ringing telephone.  Does that make sense?  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; But what leaves me still with questions is the fact that one when I ask them\n&gt; if all have returned &#39;back to their side&quot; as I have done since my first box\n&gt; session, I will get answers that sound urgent that tell me NOT YET and WAIT\n&gt; and I always get positive confirmation that they are CLEAR or DONE or BACK,\n&gt; etc.  \n&gt; \n&gt; So I don&#39;t know.. I&#39;m still on the fence about this.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; K\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; PS:  luv your screen name :-)\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\n&gt; itcdeadpeople\n&gt; Sent: Friday, March 28, 2008 10:46 AM\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Kristin. I can hear the &quot;yes it does&quot; part. I looked up some of the\n&gt; meanings of the word \n&gt; &#39;portal&#39; and found this:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A portal in fiction is a magical or technological doorway that connects two\n&gt; distant \n&gt; locations.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I suppose in this regard the &#39;ghost boxes&#39; or radios used in sweep with the\n&gt; intent of \n&gt; communication could be considered a portal of sorts, but if that is the\n&gt; case, then wouldn&#39;t \n&gt; our digital recorders (which can be used by those in spirit to produce EVP\n&gt; even when it is \n&gt; not our intent) and televisions, camcorders, ordinary cameras, etc (used by\n&gt; those in spirit \n&gt; to show their images, again, with our without our intent) also be portals? I\n&gt; recently got an \n&gt; EVP voicemail from my next door neighbor&#39;s mother, saying her name, and when\n&gt; reversed, \n&gt; the message is &quot;I love you.&quot; So I guess we&#39;d have to toss telephones and\n&gt; computers onto \n&gt; the list as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think the truth is, those in spirit can (and do!) basically go wherever\n&gt; they want, whenever \n&gt; they choose, and do not require our permission or our technology to do so.\n&gt; The only thing \n&gt; the technology does is allow us to be aware of their presence, which in many\n&gt; cases would \n&gt; have gone by unnoticed, if not for our use of the equipment. \n&gt; \n&gt; Just my thoughts on the subject. :0)\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups &lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt; .com,\n&gt; &quot;Kristin&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hey guys -I sent a message that apparently got lost in the\n&gt; &gt; stratosphere but I sent this clip because I asked about the radio as a\n&gt; &gt; portal thing back in early March and I got a fairly definite\n&gt; &gt; affirmative answer on that.
