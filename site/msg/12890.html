My thoughts on this is to kindly ask her to show respect or you will
not allow her to participate in your sessions.  Give it a try and ask
the others listening to help her to understand.

I think she would be offset if you return kindness.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t know what to do, is the second time that a spirit gets in my 
&gt; cell, just to insult me, then &quot;she&quot; gets away, then others come to 
&gt; bring wonderful messages, are some spirits envious of us ? I think its 
&gt; the same spirit that have insulted me, its a woman, don&#x27;t know who she 
&gt; was or is, but she had handled to get in to insult me. Do I have to 
&gt; tell her to go away and leave me alone ? or do I have to insult her 
&gt; back ?
&gt; 
&gt; any ideas ?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Neli
