Saturday I got to meet personally a few people who are members of a 
paranormal group with a Yahoogroup I&#x27;m on.  One of them has a theory 
about calcite being a substance that magnifies paranormal activity.  I 
haven&#x27;t researched it but he has. I thought it was fascinating.

The ancient Egyptians used a LOT of alabaster, which is a form of calcite.

Certainly food for thought and further research ...

&gt; Places with a high level water table are know to have more paranormal activity than other areas. Water conducts. Anyone see in the movie Moth Man where the guy could hear voices when he brushed his teeth? I am a Dowser and always check the water table of areas when I hear people speak of paranormal activity along with EMF. My best EVP&#x27;s have been recorded by bodies of water.

When she showered, she would hear voices and discussions, etc. We did not make the connection until someone from this list mentioned the water connection and I explained it to her...she was glad to have found some sort of explanation for this!
