Sorry to hear that Frank. I can think of plenty of actual researchers who w=
ould love to test one and are already getting great results with other meth=
ods and versions of your work. I am also sorry I didnt make it very far pas=
t the second paragraph. Karen obviously does=C2=A0not research before she w=
rites her articles.
=C2=A0
"However, the precise location of the Sanatorium=
 is a closely guarded secret." 
=C2=A0
Ummm Karen needs to learn to use Goo=
gle as well. If she had she would have been able to print out a map to Wave=
rly which includes information such as tracks, businesses, adresses=C2=A0AN=
D golf courses at the corner.=C2=A0 It even shows you an overhead view of e=
ach building you pass along the way on each street. Hint to Karen click sat=
telite view after you explore closeups of map view. 
=C2=A0
Im sorry but if=
 you are going to write a well informed article the first step is become we=
ll informed. I wont bother reading the rest of her articles because I=C2=A0=
wont waste my time looking at research from someone who cant bother to cove=
r the basics like look at a map before you drive out to someplace you've ne=
ver=C2=A0been before and then misinform people that it is in a secret locat=
ion. Nor do I see walking on a tour as as actual "investigation".
=C2=A0
Al=
ot of the people once believed the earth was flat, unfortunately they were =
not "well informed" and they too were victims of shoddy research. Luckily t=
here are those who do look beyond the horizon and open their minds to the p=
ossibility that there is more out there.
=C2=A0
Happy New Years everyone an=
d may your journey next year be in the right direction!
