Since spirit's talk very fast, it is hard to hear them speak,  this file,  
I did not slow it down because I did not want to mess it up, be  assured 
this is, My own mother's voice, she says, "Bonnie" then I hear a man's voice 
say,  and almost on top or right after her's saying, her name,  "Elaine"  and 
then when I reverse the file, the man says,  "Your mom," then,  "loves you"  
but as I said before  it is a very fast, and I did not want to slow it down 
for fear, it might be  ruined.  Isn't it nice to know, we all live on?  God 
Bless you all,  sf
