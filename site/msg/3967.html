<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ann,

I guess a bit of explaining is called for. First off, the EVPs I 
uploaded to Filecrunch are there and in good working order. That site 
offers free uploads and downloads sometime too big for Yahoo, but 
there is a trick to using it.

After you click on the link to my page there, click on a file name 
you wish to download. The following page has a 10 second delay before 
they&#x27;ll allow you to download. Just scroll down the page, and when 
you see the Download Now, click and away you go...

Thanks for reminding me to clarify that!

Lance

&gt; I&#x27;d really like to listen to these, but when I try to open them, I  
&gt; get nothing at all. Can you upload them to our files or just 
attach  
&gt; them to e-mail or both?

&gt; &gt; Good Evening!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve been very busy today going through a long, intense audio
&gt; &gt; recording taken at the Gainesville, Texas house, which my team
&gt; &gt; investigated on Sunday, November 25th.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; All of the EVPs I just posted were gathered in the unoccupied
&gt; &gt; upstairs bedroom. Only three investigators were present in the 
room.
&gt; &gt; Their voices have been properly taken into account and ruled out 
as
&gt; &gt; sources of the actual EVPs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The new and resampled EVPs have been saved as .mp3 files. They 
can be
&gt; &gt; freely downloaded from the site here -
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://www.filecrunch.com/user/orbhunterx
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You will hear quite a few odd words, dog barks, and even mimicry.
&gt; &gt; Some of the voices are faint and whispery. Other EVP voices sound
&gt; &gt; like the invisibles are standing right along side the researchers!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sexual Content Warning:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Several of the EVPs have strong sexual content.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Please read the file name prior to downloading.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Listening to the EVPs will be at your own disgression.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That stated, those that choose to listen to the EVPs, please let 
me
&gt; &gt; know if any of them need further contextual clarification. I look
&gt; &gt; forward to hearing feedback. As it stands, the true nature of 
what&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; going on in the house awaits much more serious attention.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sincerely,
&gt; &gt; Lance Oliver, Founder
&gt; &gt; Denton Area Paranormal Society
