<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>from what I know, just keep a positive attitude, and you should be fine.... approach it with joy, the positive energy facilitates the communication... and I think one really *ought to* approach this with joy because the simple fact that we can even have this communication is reason to celebrate... don&#x27;t be fazed some of the grumpy earthbound spirit voices, we all get them, they&#x27;re just in a bad mood, cause they&#x27;re stuck in the etheric plane...  if they flip you off, just tell them &quot;I love you, be nice&quot;  and give them a virtual hug in your mind... they&#x27;re just unhappy people, they need our love not our fear....
