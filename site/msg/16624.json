I have actually gotten involved with a group who does this now.  We have captured a few EVP&#39;s and it&#39;s just insane when you first hear them.   I came across some directions for building a Frank&#39;s box, and was wondering 1)how well do they work?  2)does anybody have a full parts list of what I would need to build one?   I don&#39;t want to do just the hacked radio shack version.   I would rather build my own from scratch.   Just curious though.  Any help would be appreciated."}
