Got lots of great files in there, Frank, these two are not a drop in the  
buckett to what you got here, a few spirits coming into the light see they 
are  "naked" one asks for some one to "throw down pants"  and of course I 
asked  David what this is all about, He says that while they are in the lower  
plains  they cannot see and are in total darkness they are "all naked" they  
can't really see each other.  But when each steps up into the light, it's  
like a little arched doorway, with three small steps going up, and a  small 
place to stand and kneel down, which is what they are all  asked to do before 
they go in when they are coming out  of the lower  plain.
 
Once they enter the light is when they can see that they are naked, it  
might be one reason, He takes them in only one at a time, maybe.  Then  someone 
in the light covers or gives them a spirit rope to cover them up as they  
come in, then after they meet with Jesus, and He talks to them for about 10  
minutes our time, He wants everyone within the fold, but they must forgive  
everyone that has ever hurt them plus be willing to make up for harm they 
did  while on Earth, and believe in what Christ did for them.  It is then 
where  they go to see the guardian angels, and the loved ones, and go to their  
new homes.   In these two files, I hear, "throw down pants" in the other  
one, I hear, "we're naked!"  "me too."   If a person dies a  believer all 
ready, you don't need to go through that but, are already in the  light when one 
dies, there is no need to cross over because you are already  there so to 
speak.  At least that is the way Tech David describes things.  sf
