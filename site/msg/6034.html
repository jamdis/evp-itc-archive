Ok people it is really becoming obvious who is here for what. I get tired of coming home to read a bunch of foul mouth comments that are meant to rip and tear each other down. TAKE THAT CRAP TO PRIVATE EMAIL!!!!! If you have something nasty to say I  DONT WANT TO READ IT.
   
  I and most of the others here do NOT want to be your audience. If you need an audience start your own group! The ban button is being mentioned and if it gets used I cant say I would blame any of the moderators/owners here for it.
   
  Are you here to research or are you here to play word wars. You should all be ashamed of yourselves really. Ive taught preschoolers that have better manners and better ways to work thru disagreements. 
   
  Some of you get on here and preach about what the voices say, love peace harmony working together...then the next thing I know you are at the forefront anytime anyone has something to say that ticks you off.
   
  Some of you are skeptics here just to disprove...did ya read the sign on the front door? Maybe you should go back and check that out.
   
  As for those few of you associated with Chris Moon who get dragged into constant fights because of it. Chris Moon is just a man....plain old human guy just like the rest of us. He says what he thinks, and he goes with what he believes. I dont have to believe what Chris does anymore than he has to believe in what I do. Give it a rest already. He is nobodys master. It is just that there are people he has met who believe in what he does, have seen some results maybe, and possibly became friends with the guy. You think he is misguided, or wrong...ok fine maybe he is. Either way thats not OUR problem, so keep it in private emails. 
   
  As for those who have nothing but negative, skeptical, things to say....dont you have something better to do? Somewhere to go? People to hang out with? Why are you wasting time with this?
   
  Get a grip, or I will.
   
  Misty
