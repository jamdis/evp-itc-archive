            Hi Ralph,
   
  My sister and I were also in Gettysburg last November and she captured an apparition in infrared with her digital camera in the middle of the Triangular Field.  We also captured some strange otherworldly sounds in the Wheatfield.  As to your EVPs captured in the men's room, in my opinion, the Lucifer EVP should be regarded with a bit of suspicion because unless the statement could be concretely substantiated using conventional scientific methods currently at our disposal, there's no way to determine the veracity of such statements.  However, the very statement itself is negative in nature (insofar as we're not devil worshippers), and I will be cautious in conducting any more EVPs in the men's room because it sounds like the spirit(s) is pulling your leg.  
   
  Just my opinion, 
  Sharon
