Hi All

I have to admit that I share the same opinion as Bruce. I dont what=
 everyones take is on this but I felt that some of moon and even Franks att=
itude was slightly arrogant. I am a researcher in the UK using old reel to =
reel methods and obtaining excellent results. I lost some family and some c=
lose friends=A05 yeara ago=A0and suddenly it dawned on me...what is life al=
l about. I went on to research every evp pioneer i could, listen to hours/d=
ays of recordings and it changed my outlook on life. tears were turned to s=
miles and then I realised what all this research is for. it was a big step =
for me spiritually. 

I dont know if there is anyone else on here using old=
 fashioned methods but if anybody would like to hear recordings please ask.=
 I am using a reel to reel sony "Hi frequency" recorder and trying various =
types of tones, backgrounds e.t.c.

Good luck to everyone with their resear=
ch, you are right we are changing history we are discovering new things. if=
 it wasnt for individuals such as raudive, jurghenson to name a few, maybe =
we wouldnt have discovered this. it takes a brave individual to tackle an a=
rrogant human race blunted with science.

Kind Regards

The quiet one :-)

guys,

Sorry to burden you with this nonsense but this=
 group and the RTSC group are my only venues to respond to posts on other g=
roups and have my account heard, I hope you do not mind to much.

Here is a=
 copy of my final personal e-mail to Frank Sumption which by the way is mea=
nt for him but he see's fit to post them publicly in an attempt to discredi=
t me.

I want you to read it first hand so there are no chance of it being =
altered before it is posted else where.

I will not address Frank again
---=
--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -

Frank,

This=
 is getting ridiculous now, you should stop writing these posts, all you ar=
e doing is making yourself look ridiculous.

I have offered many times to m=
ake my raw recordings available for review by anyone who wants them. I have=
 made the same challenge to your friend moon who we all know is behind this=
 tirade he has time and again refused or ignored the request for any type o=
f audio file
to be publicly posted for revue and continues to take advantag=
e of innocent unsuspecting people with his con game and charging large amou=
nts of money for sessions where he fabricates and makes up content as he go=
es along.

I was the only one to confront him in public and expose him for =
the fake he is and this is his feeble attempt at retaliation. I and other r=
esearchers like me have brought this research light years from where it was=
 when you and I first met, moon just continues to use it to rip people off =
and has not contributed a thing to the research of ghost box communication =
beside lining his own pockets. 

Just the fact that he has you doing his di=
rty work shows the type of guy he is. I can remember a time when you public=
ly came out against any type of money making using your boxes and even refu=
sed moon when he wanted to manufacture and sell them for large profits yet =
now you condone his robbery of innocent unaware people and actually act foo=
lish on his behest.

Frank you are better than this, just concentrate on de=
veloping a better box and forget about moon and his tricks and lies, he is =
finished in the paranormal and he knows it, everyone is wise to his game an=
d he is practically an outcast.

Frank you are hitching you wagon to a dead=
 horse. Get away from these bad influences before they ruin your reputation=
 as well.

We have had this moon discussion in the past and once he has exh=
austed his need for you he will screw you again like he has done so many ti=
mes before.

Frank, I like and respect you and I hope you will consider wha=
t I have said in this e-mail and I sincerely hope you post this one on the =
evp-itc group. I will be posting it on my group and others I belong to.

Yo=
ur former friend
Bruce
