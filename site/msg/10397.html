Yes I did when I first started I did not record at all because I was doing  
lengthy box sessions just talking and listening.  it would be a real pain  to 
transcribe over an hours worth of audio.  But the end result justified  the 
means.  I received great contact and communication and the spirits on  the other 
side got to know better.  Better than if I just sat here and  started doing 
5-10 sessions and recording them.  Once they get to know you  it all opens up to 
you.  Good luck.

Hi Rees,
 
I have done this before in fact just recently.  I did it with my  brother's 
fatherinlaw 2 days after he died.  My technician helped me  out and went and 
got this guy for me and I just about flipped when his voice  actually came over 
the radio.  Unfortunately it did not record.   It was only meant for my ears.

thank you and it does make very good  sense.

Hi Rees. When I record, I'll ask for them. I think your views on  the subject 
are wonderful, 
and not in the slightest disrespectful.  

I know for me, when someone makes their transition after having  lived a 
long, full life, it 
isn't as hard for me to deal with  because it's just sad, not tragic (if that 
makes sense.) I 
hope your  great aunt and uncle are enjoying a glorious reunion! :-)
