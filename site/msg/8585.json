It has a built in microphone.\n\n=\r\nSo far I have gotten two different voices. \n\nBoth of them are easily heard =\r\nwithout the headphones on my tape recorder.\n\nBefore I start recording I alw=\r\nays say a prayer of protection and ask if any one wants to communicate with=\r\n me, but that they must come in love, light and peace, etc.\n\nThe first voic=\r\ne that I received was a male voice that said &quot;Peace.&quot;\n\nThe second voice tha=\r\nt I received was a female voice. I had asked if there were any Spirits here=\r\n that would like to talk to me. She said, &quot;No, no Spirits.&quot; Then someone wa=\r\nlking, (I presume her) with very audible footsteps with heels are heard. \n\n=\r\nMy thoughts are that maybe she isn&#39;t aware that she has died or that she is=\r\n an Angelic presence of some sort that never took birth. \n\nI don&#39;t know if =\r\nanyone has read Mark Macy&#39;s book &quot;Miracles In The Storm&quot;, but it is great. =\r\nI also enjoyed Sara Estep&#39;s book &quot;Voices Of Eternity&quot;, which is available f=\r\nree online. http://aaevp.com/voices_of_eternity_web.pdf\n\nBlessings ALL,\n\nJe=\r\nremy Robert Huber\nNew York, New York\n\n\n\n \n \n \r\n------=_NextPart_000_0060_01C89281.DAA8C830\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3Dtext/html;charset=3Diso-8859-1&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16609&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY id=\r\n=3DMailContainerBody \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-RIGHT: 10px; PADDING-LEFT: 10px; PAD=\r\nDING-TOP: 15px; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; \nbgColor=3D#ffffff leftMargin=3D=\r\n0 topMargin=3D0 CanvasTabStop=3D&quot;true&quot; \nname=3D&quot;Compose message area&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D4&gt;Hello Everyone,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D4&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D4&gt;I ha=\r\nve recently started doing EVP/ITC \nresearch.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D4&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D4&gt;I am=\r\n using a regular cassette tape recorder for \nnow.
