<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Cool Debbie. Sending all 1.5 million of them to him now hehehe. Just 
kiddin. I wouldnt know where to start/end. 

I did get one evp last night I am excited about tho. Was a nice gift. A 
repeat of my very first evp from my mother, saying exactly what she 
said how she said it all those years ago. A bit off on her soft tone 
voice but the message was the same. It is loud and clear and was using 
ST method which she doesnt like to use usually.

I was always a bit disheartened that I didnt know what I was doing when 
I got that first message and screwed up on saving it before my pc 
crashed. I didnt think it would ever be recovered completely to how I 
heard it that night. But for this one I saved it right, no pc crashin 
goin on, and now I am left with a nice repeat today to hold onto.

I may post that to the files area in a bit.
