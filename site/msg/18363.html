sorry ursula for interfering, but i dont think, this is the right way for
discussing with matt. a bit more decency is desiderable.
matt has done very interesting considerations and i agree with his opinion. 
 
i think, we need in our research more details and these important details
can give us maybe
scientist with scientific investigations. telling that scientists are
"stupid,stepdorks, "non-belivers",etc
is not fair.
 
sorry for my bad english, but i have reading for a long time here in the
list, and now i though, it was
the moment to write my 2 cents.
 
for information: my name is salvi, ham operator since 1990 with call HB9GBY,
i am living in bern, switzerland, 
builder of the experimental-units named ghost-station. i have a homepage
www.transkommunikation.ch <http://www.transkommunikation.ch/>  , 
not completly finished yet and at the moment only in german language.
 
best regards
 
salvi

Well Id first wish to introduce myself. My name is Matt Dowdell and im from
a small group of people who have been doing paranormal
research/investigation in the CT area. This is my first post, but i have
been lurking threw these forums for some time.

One thing i would like everyone who reads this realize is that paranormal
research/investigating, like any new science, nothing can be written in
stone.

Now i do want to say that the research into the boxes and other devices by
Frank and others can not go unnoticed, but there is still one or two flaws
in them.

I mean, with the short bit i listened to, i dont feel as if they are bashing
you or frank personally but the idea behind the boxes, but without a doubt
in a ignorant fashion.

Regardless, i personally try to stay away from the boxes, but i join this
site inorder to learn more about them and how they work. To me the boxes
have to much "chance" to may be or may not be something. I have used one in
the past and had an interesting result, but for all i know, it could have
been a rogue radio wave from a station in the area. Im just hoping to give
you an idea of this thinking is VS bashing your ideas and work, which im
simpley not. Science is about proving something from every angle and being
without a doubt its correct without anyone able to say its something else.

Unfortunetly, with the boxes, there is alot of noise and when matrixing
comes into mind, you create a situation where something is absolutly
nothing, seems to be otherwise. Im not saying they dont work, from it, again
im saying it could be a "chance".

Video, pictures are fool proof, audio really isnt, and honestly, when my
team picks up EVPs we go into them with a doubtful mind and dont depend on
them to be our evidence.
