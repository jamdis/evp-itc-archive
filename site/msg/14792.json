I made a Radio-shak hack with directions from UFOgeek&#39;s videos. This was our first attepmt with it. How or where would i upload the wav file for you guys to take a listen.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am having a hard time getting some of our more skeptical members to buy into the ITC-EVP ghost box stuff. I am convinced with everything i seen and read about Frank and all his work to what i saw on Youtube etc...\n&gt; \n&gt; please respond\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
