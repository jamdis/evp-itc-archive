Why take the a=

ng".=A0 If you're trying to be a researcher, you need to look under all the=
 rocks, listen to all the opinions, be ready to back up your claims, or to =
change your mind. 

Saying " i am just gonna ignore his responses" moves yo=

 consider other opinions.

here was some replys from my team member =
who considers himself our de-bunker:

The one pertaining to "He wouldn't ki=
ll" here was his reply:

"doesnt sound like "he wouldn't kill" sounds like =
" he wont show ?(her) it was cut off.
anyway why would we call this an evp?=
"

This was his response to the one where we asked what happened when they =
tried to escape and got the response "da pit"

He says:"this one sound like=
 a sports radio frequency "the Pitt" sburgh Penquins. I hear do "back off".=

example of just radio chatter scanning, to me. would you submit as evidenc=
e?"

The one where we asked about how to get thru the steel bars and wood a=
nd we get the "Take ur file" as a response, my team member who isn't buying=
 any of this replys:
"I slowed end down sounds like "take your final" or "f=
indings could be talking college radio, who knows, its radio frequencies"

=
by the way after i slowed the same file down i noticed it comes thru betwee=
n 6-8 different clicks on 12-469 radio on the am channel. AS we all know th=
at would equal about 6-8 different channels. what is the chances of getting=
 an understandable phrase in the same tone of voice across that many channe=
ls... i should pose that response back to him and see what his de-bunking r=
esult would be?

I guess he's intitled to his own opinion, i am just gonna =
ignore his responses and keep doing what i am doing. Thanks for the support=
 and knowledge!
