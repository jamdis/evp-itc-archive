Hey Frank,Have you had m=
uch success in addressing things with C2C folks?I'm a C2C Streamlink member=
 and would love to hear them interview you. I had a lot of misconceptions d=
ue to what some have attributed to you in the past, specifically regarding =
your device being something Jesus personally approved. Don't get me wrong t=
hough. As a Vice President of the board of a Unity church, I consider Jesus=
 to be a friend and way shower. I'm sure glad to see you're a serious resea=
rch engineer. It's painfully obvious that some folks are all about steering=
 these efforts to their own ends by pushing the religous angle.Keep the gre=
