<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Looks good to me!  Op amps are cheap ways of getting function generation.
And the p-n junction of a transistor or a diode is a great way to generate
noise. Just gotta amplify it.

Those old 1N21 bullet diodes would generate nose up into the microwave
spectrum.

&gt; That&#x27;s why I use the op amps--SIMPLE!. I can&#x27;t do math, so there&#x27;s no way
&gt; to use discrete components. I use a simple op amp function generator to
&gt; creat the triangle wave used for linear sweep. I use the op amps as an
&gt; anmplifier in the random system to amplify the white noise from a
&gt; transistor, and then as a filter to get rid of all but the lowest frequency
&gt; components of the white noise to get a smooth, randomly varying DC voltage
&gt; used to tune the radios.
&gt;
&gt; The radios are voltage tunable, so you have three sections to the box--a
&gt; radio, the sweep, and the audio amplifiers. Sweep is amother name for he
&gt; tuning voltage, also abreviated VT.
&gt;
&gt; So far the MK484 chip used as the tuner, combined with linear sweep is a
&gt; simple and compact system. Most store bought radios, including the radio
&gt; shack models are inconsistent in quality, and are often very noisy(staticy)
&gt; when swept across their tuning range. I got tired of spending 40 bucks for a
&gt; tuner only to have it sound like crap when the box is assembled, that&#x27;s why
&gt; I&#x27;m spending alot of time on making radios. Car tuners were the worst for
&gt; being noisy.
&gt;
&gt; Brief history-I started out using tuner modules form car stereos for the
&gt; box radio. These were swept wiht a random voltage. The result was often so
&gt; noisy that the voices could barely be heard. It did not occur to me to use
&gt; other tuners until Bill Chapple came out with the Radio Shack hack, and I
&gt; was like DAHHHHH! I can use other radios. So at first I sued the whole
&gt; radio, develpoing switching to turn them on a sweep them with an external
&gt; voltage, then finding out how to use the tuner alone, removing the control
&gt; board. Even then the boxes were a crap shoot, as the radios were often very
&gt; poor sounding when swept. So now I&#x27;m working on various home made tuners.

&gt; &gt; An op amp is an &quot;operational amplifier&quot; which is essentially treated as a
&gt; &gt; little box that amplifies linearly whatever is put into it. By using
&gt; &gt; different resistors in a circuit you can adjust the gain of the op amp
&gt; &gt; circuit.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m not sure exactly how Frank is using one for the tuning. It&#x27;s not very
&gt; &gt; common to use an op amp as a noise source but I think it&#x27;s been done.
&gt; There
&gt; &gt; are better noise sources out there.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; There was a smaller Schematic Frank posted about using the tuner from a
&gt; &gt; &gt; radioshack 469. It was a smaller diagram just showing where to plug
&gt; your
&gt; &gt; &gt; signal into the vt, and to provide the 3v into the tuner. Sorry im not
&gt; more
&gt; &gt; &gt; specific, im a newbie to circuits.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank emailed me back and said for a random sweep he no longer likes
&gt; using
&gt; &gt; &gt; the white noise generator, and instead prefers to use a dual supply op
&gt; amp.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Im not entirely sure what a op amp is or how to use it. Im assuming it
&gt; &gt; &gt; produces a random signal that can be used for the VT. BUt I need to do
&gt; alot
&gt; &gt; &gt; more research to learn what it really does.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello all,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for having me apart of your yahoo group. Ive been researching
&gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; a lot and was overly excited to find a group that actually has frank
&gt; posting
&gt; &gt; &gt; in it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m about to attempt to make my first box ( well i have made the
&gt; ufogeek
&gt; &gt; &gt; radio shack hack, but that was too easy). I plan to try and make the
&gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; with a random voltage generator that&#x27;s plugged into the Radio Shack
&gt; 499, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; if I can do that successfully, out to an echo-box before heading out.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My question to you all is if you could point me in the right
&gt; direction to
&gt; &gt; &gt; get up to speed enough on circuits and electronics via a website or
&gt; book. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have no experience doing this kind of stuff. But im a quick learner and
&gt; &gt; &gt; really want to make this happen.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the help everyone,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; God Bless and Good Results to you all.
