Is the input voltage after the divider to the TL082 supposed to be 4 or 5 volts I wonder.\n\nI had heard the circuit is stable up to 12v, but I don&#39;t know. Also when I check the output, It should be varying between 1-8v, but starts at 4.9 volts and starts to drop off about .5v per 2o seconds at a steady rate.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s pretty much what I use. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; From: ourobouros2k2@...\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thu, 2 Apr 2009 22:39:11 +0000\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Corrections to schematics\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; this might work\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://d.yimg.com/kq/groups/18063865/sn/2143804010/name/LINEAR.jpg\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I couldn&#39;t find it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; F-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: ourobouros2k2@\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Thu, 2 Apr 2009 21:53:33 +0000\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Corrections to schematics\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I placed the sweeper diagram I found in a photo folder marked Andy&#39;s stuff here on the group.

It is a linear sweep circuit, and I keep frying resistors on the initial voltage divider. I don&#39;t think that the 10 ohm value is correct as listed. I know little to nothing about electronics, but I am trying to learn. On the breadboard I keep cooking off 1/2 watt resistors, and by the voltage calculators I found online, using those values seems to be putting close to 2 watts though the resistors. I can only think that the 10 ohm divider values are wrong, but I don&#39;t know what they should be.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think I will just try your circuit, although it is a bit intimidating to a newbie, lol. I have no problem assembling pcb stuff according to directions, but the actual building and experimenting with, well I am still trying to learn. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks so much for your contributions with the schematics. I am looking forward to making an externally sweep tuned 469 or 820.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thanks \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Andy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, if I could draw this stuff accurately it might help. There was some mistakes in the random section of the sweep circuit. So I replaced the sweep schematic in my folder. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
