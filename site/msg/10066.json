I&#39;m probably going to just scrap \nthis \n&gt; session, i spent 2 hours going over 45 seconds to bring out a \nmessage \n&gt; that&#39;s so unclear to everyone else.  It&#39;s so frustrating that the \n&gt; radio method is so flawed, i want it to be clear and it never is.  \n&gt; And if i do get something that&#39;s interesting, most people will say \n&gt; it&#39;s just radio anyway.  That&#39;s why i&#39;m trying to get away from \nthe \n&gt; radios, although it&#39;s robotic sounding---sound soap has been the \nbest \n&gt; so far.  Clearer and longer messages, with hardly any editing.  \nThe \n&gt; boxes are unable to get full sentences from them and i don&#39;t care \n&gt; what anybody else claims to get.  You will get some good &quot;yes&quot; \n&gt; and &quot;no&quot; answers, but the rest will be questioned and heard \n&gt; differently by others.
