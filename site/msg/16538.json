There are at least THREE things going on. 1) SOme voices are REAL and &quot;impressed&quot; upon the sound carrier. These can be heard by everyone. 2) In some cases the &quot;impression&quot; is not as &quot;clean&quot; and one has to develop &quot;an ear&quot; so to speak, to hear them (like sea legs, but for EVP) 3)the sound forms an enabling &quot;random feild&quot; in the head of the listener which makes him psychically open to the voices of the spirits directly.\n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rj &lt;rasterer@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Thanks Tom for your comments.

Two things appear to be going on though. \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; First there is an actual voice modulated signal. Different people who listen to it often hear the same thing. The sound is not perfect and is very noisy, so that would explain others who cannot hear the message.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; The second thing is that some people can listen to the noise as a &quot;random field&quot;, and with a slightly altered state of mind, this field will induce latent &quot;mediumship&quot; ability in the operator and he or she will get a lot more information and voice material than another listener.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Note that the content random fields have little or nothing in common with whatever imagery or sounds may be percieved from them. They simply enhance the user to access psychic information that, while even not being a &quot;psychic&quot; allows him to get info normally innaccessable to him/her.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; If there is any objective percieved sound similar to what is heard by others impressed upon the background noise, it might be due to the spirit who is speaking being PRESENT. That entity would then be able to get the message through to the operator Psychicly on another level. that the words are also in the noise would be a co-incidence.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; I work with VISUAL random fields---The imagery, while clear, is formed in my mind/eye system , so I cannot photograph it. Some of this EVP background noise may be working the same way too---formed in the Mind/EAR system. This is only heard by the primary operator and likely cannot be recorded to a file. \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; But some random field stuff IS objective--for example, using a random backdrop for ghost photos makes the ghosts easier to, and more often appear in a photo. This is equavalent to the EVP that people can hear on the recorded file.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; I will discuss and explain random field theory itself, later, in its own posting. \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@ ..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; Just a guess, since I don&#39;t have a lot of experience with this - probably\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; the mesages are meant for one user and it&#39;s best if one user listens at a\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; time.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; It could be that some messages come through that are meant for multiple\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; users at once.

In order to help develop some good testing\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; for it, I think the first step is to get a common or official consensus or\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; statement on what it is the Frank&#39;s Box is claiming to be doing.
