If ghosts are coming through the box \nand thus are  not in a good state of mind, how come on Paranormal \nState CM was willing  to believe the message given by the ghost via \nthe box as being truth  (The ghost via the box said a &quot;demon&quot; was \nholding the ghosts captive  there)? \n\nI would suggest that perhaps a ghost (assuming we are  talking about a \ndisembodied person who remains earthbound) is not in a  healthy state \nof mind one would consider &quot;stable,&quot; but trapped in  emotional trauma \nof some sort. Thus, how reliable could the message of a  ghost then \nbe? ;)\n\nLC\n\n--- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com_ (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) ,  \n&quot;wgungfu&quot; &lt;wgungfu3@.. .&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t know if anyone  caught it, but Frank&#39;s box was used on last\n&gt; night&#39;s episode of  Paranormal State on A&E.

Their niche in the &quot;paranormal reality tv show&quot;  market is that\n&gt; the group&#39;s leader follows a more Christian  orientated skew on\n&gt; happenings. Lots of &quot;demons&quot; (they have Lorraine  Warren guest all \nthe\n&gt; time), and they usually try to do  investigations/ communication only\n&gt; during what they call &quot;dead  time&quot;, 3am-4am, or &quot;the polar opposite \nof\n&gt; 3pm - the time Jesus  gave is life for all mankind&quot; as they put it. \nOh,\n&gt; and they have  an &quot;occult specialist&quot; on the team that so far has \nbeen\n&gt; anything  but.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the positive side, they did actually get (and  record for later\n&gt; analysis) live communication on the box in response  to questions \nbeing\n&gt; asked. And on the analysis and isolation of  the recorded parts, you\n&gt; could actually hear what was being said (as  opposed to the usual of\n&gt; Chris acting as a go-between for very  distorted sounds like on those\n&gt; youtube videos).
