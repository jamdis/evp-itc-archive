I said there are hundreds of examples on line \nof  \n&gt; known long exposures. When even a few of these are compared with  \n&gt; Luminator examples, I see a tremendous similarity. Do you?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; but there are a couple of dozen in Macy&#39;s book, &quot;Spirit Faces,&quot; \nand  \n&gt; &gt; yes, many many of them are open to wide interpretation,\n&gt; \n&gt; Does that mean that you agree with my point? Because, as I reason  \n&gt; it,  they are either spirit extras or they aren&#39;t. They can&#39;t sort-\nof  \n&gt; be spirit extras. I&#39;m not sure what other interpretations there \nmight  \n&gt; be in this instance.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; just as our humble recordings are.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   In addition to that majority that make us say, &quot;Come on!{&quot; \nthere  \n&gt; &gt; are a handful that make you say &quot;Hmmmmmmm. . . .&quot; Just like we  \n&gt; &gt; offer a handful of results from our endless recording efforts to  \n&gt; &gt; try to convince the hard-nosed.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d agree with you wholeheartedly, if I had ever seen one that \ndid,  \n&gt; in fact, make me go, &quot;Hmmmm.&quot; As I said, I have never seen one \nwhere  \n&gt; the sitter and the extra did not share a consistent set of \nfeatures  \n&gt; and coloring. If you have any examples that do, and you can share  \n&gt; them, I&#39;d be delighted to see them. I&#39;d like my opinion to be \nswayed.  \n&gt; Really, I would.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would think that many would see the Luminator efforts as a \nmodern  \n&gt; &gt; effort at scrying.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you mean scrying as in the psychomanteum method developed by  \n&gt; Raymond Moody? My understanding, from attending a presentation by \nDr.  \n&gt; Moody, was that the psychomanteum produced full-blown apparitions  \n&gt; that could converse with the bereaved. Not sure these two types of  \n&gt; events are comparable.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Everything we do crosses boundaries, and my point is that it&#39;s  \n&gt; &gt; really hard to walk the line between trying to be scientific and  \n&gt; &gt; trying to be open.  It&#39;s really, really hard! But if we give in \none  \n&gt; &gt; area, we have to be willing to give in another.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think that is arguably true, Ursula. If the evidence \nappears  \n&gt; good, I acknowledge it; if the evidence appears weak, I \nacknowledge  \n&gt; it. It is simply not true to say that a person cannot be both open- \n&gt; minded and scientific. I really do want to believe, but I won&#39;t  \n&gt; believe just because I want to. And because you, me, or anyone  \n&gt; &quot;gives&quot; in one area, does not make a phenomenon any more or less \nreal.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your fellow traveler on this journey,\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ursula\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; This is a classic example of the kind of photo that Mark thinks \nshows\n&gt; &gt; a spirit extra. To me, clearly, this is the same woman--same hair,\n&gt; &gt; same eyes, same mouth, same nose. Again, to me, it looks like a\n&gt; &gt; classic long exposure when compared with other known long \nexposures--\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve included just of hundreds of examples.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
