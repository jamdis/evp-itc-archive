Wher have I been.....??
   
  I finally got a look at the video!
   
  That is amazing Margaret and Bryan!
   
  So is this what Nostradamas used as well? I have watched several shows on him, and he uses a black bowl with a candle.

              Ok, so since I love to try new things out and have been wanting to try this out for a while, I hooked up a loop last night with my web cam and got several images.

While watching the video loop live with me, my friend started pointing out several immediately as the images appeared.  Here is one she saw, but I wanted to get your guys opinionated too.  Please tell me what you see, if anything at all. 

Thanks,
Bryan

    OMGosh. It took me forever to figure out how to do everything to create my YouTube video, 
but I finally got it all together and posted. I've never done anything of this nature before. 
LOL - sometimes I can be a wee bit on the technologically challenged side! ;-)

Hope you enjoy it if you decide to watch. I figured another video promoting the POSITIVE 
side to spirit communication would help counterbalance some of the garbage out there.
