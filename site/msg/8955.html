<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Jeff.  If that is your motivation, that would be entirely up to you.  ;-)

I fault the buyers much more so than the sellers ... who would not be able to sell units like 
this at the prices he is, if the buyers would not buy at that price.  

I also try not to judge people without knowing their circumstances.  Most of us could use a 
little more money in our pockets, and as long as we come by the money honestly, so be it.  
He has set a price.  Obviously others find it fair or they would not willingly pay it.  And 
people would not bid against one another to the point of the price becoming ridiculous, 
but they do.  Again, can&#x27;t fault the sellers for that.  

As I said in my early post, goods and services can only be sold for whatever the market 
will bear.  We are not talking necessities here.  It&#x27;s a radio.  A &#x27;luxury&#x27; item, so to speak.  
And one that could be bought and hacked for half the price.  But for whatever reason, 
people are willing to buy at this premium price.  

If you were thinking like a business man, you&#x27;d do exactly the same thing and under cut 
him by $5!  LOL.  Now THAT would make a statement.  Selling at a loss only says, &quot;I&#x27;m a 
fool.&quot;  Just my thoughts on the subject.  Sorry.  It&#x27;s my corporate mentality coming though.  
I spent 15-years in the highly competitive field of computer sales where the attitude was 
that of looking at what is working for others, finding a way to it better, or just as well, 
offering it at lower price that is still profitable to you, and taking as much business away 
as possible from the other guy.
