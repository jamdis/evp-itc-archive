<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>In my mind the word &quot;skeptic&quot; is a misnomer. There is a difference between a
skeptic and an unbeliever.

If I said &quot;I&#x27;m skeptical about your rebuilding that engine&quot; I would admit
that it&#x27;s possible, just doubt that you&#x27;re going to do it.  An unbeliever
wouldn&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s even possible to rebuild engines.

I think most of the &quot;skeptics&quot; we see in any sort of paranormal sphere are
really unbelievers. As Frank pointed out, they don&#x27;t even believe or
recognize that we ARE spirits, so how could a ghost exist and how could the
box work? A ghost could hit them in the head with a 2X4 and they still
wouldn&#x27;t believe it.

&gt; Not to mention that when they want to &quot;test&quot; something they are already
&gt; skeptical about, then they will come up with impossible criteria. The day I
&gt; finally stopped caring why a ghost box worked and just accepted that it did
&gt; was the start of rewarding sessions.
&gt;
&gt; I think most of us are beyond the point where skeptics can make a dent in
&gt; our searching for answers. Skepticism can be good, but sometimes it can be
&gt; self defeating. More people just want to make a name for themselves by
&gt; trying to be the one that brought down this or that device. If they would
&gt; try some of these methods with an open mind and a brief suspension of
&gt; disbelief, then they might get their own rewarding experiences as well...

&gt; &gt; Well then, just build youself a box and test the hell out of it!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve said all along that one has to be careful not to create the
&gt; voices/answers one wants to hear. We are, despite appearances, spirit, and
&gt; we can create our own spirit voices just as easy as any other entity. But
&gt; what do I know, I just make the damn boxes and I don&#x27;t even believe in ghost
&gt; hunting!?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Whatever these brainiacs claim that want to do all this testing--they
&gt; never-ever ask the freaking inventors! They can&#x27;t even get their heads
&gt; around EVPmaker, so pretend that doesn&#x27;t even exist, even though the box
&gt; came later. Probably they think it would be easier to disprove the box. Some
&gt; duffus puts a DR. in front of his name and I&#x27;m supposed to be impressed, it
&gt; just means all intellect has been programmed out. After all , they &quot;know&quot;
&gt; there are no spirits, so it has to be something else--anything else!

I I said &quot;I&#x27;m skep ical abou you ebuilding ha engine&quot; I would admi ha i &#x27;s possible, jus doub ha you&#x27; e going o do i .  An unbelie e wouldn&#x27; belie e ha i &#x27;s e en possible o ebuild engines.
