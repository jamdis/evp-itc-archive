I've received 'hi's' from my general questions but one time I did 
receive an answer. I was sitting on a marker in a cemetery. I put my 
recorder on and asked if anyone was there. On the recording a woman asks 
'who ARE you'? rather indignant. I guess I shouldn't have been sitting 
on her marker :-)
