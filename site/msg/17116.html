Happy Mother's Day everyone, I just sent a sad file to my folder, there is  
a funny one in there too.  The sad one is an older lady and young man  
talking to each other, The lady is concerned, saying; "Nick,  get up to the 
group, he responds with, "they'll see us, she says, are they  praying for us?"  
Pardon me, but I think we have been given this  technology for a purpose, 
maybe it's to help these souls in darkness, i know  some of you don't believe 
this, and it's always easier to turn our backs, and  not see pain in someone 
else.  But, there is a reason, you with all those  radios's out there, with 
all that power, try helping these folks over there, it  won't hurt us to 
say silent prayers for them once and awhile think about it  folks. sf
