I&#39;m thinking it won&#39;t work because the allophones voice tone and \nenunciation isn&#39;t distinct enough for the program to learn recognition (as Aaron \nmentioned).  My father recently tried with a friend to have the program learn his voice, and \nwas unable to do so (his voice is deep and can be a little hoarse sounding at times, which \napparently prevented recognition.)  Let us know what you discover if you try this.\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kolrone&quot; &lt;a.cronk@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if that would work. I remember back in the day, which was\n&gt; a Wednesday by the way (lol), you used to have to train the program to\n&gt; recognize your speech. I don&#39;t know if that has changed since then.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Aaron\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Michael Edwards &lt;f1cracker75@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Has anyone on this site purchased voice to print software to use for\n&gt; the allophone program? \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; http://www.digitalriver.com/v2.0-img/operations/scansoft/site/367062/367062_dns-\ntalk.html\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Michael Edwards:  f1cracker75@\n&gt; &gt;  between 0000-00-00 and 9999-99-99       &lt;hr size=1&gt;Be a better\n&gt; friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
