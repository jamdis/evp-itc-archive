I try to test each part as I \nbuild, but there&#39;s always problems with these hand made boards.  I had a bad \ntwo cent capacitor that made me nuts for days before I found it, but now the \nfirst board( system #18) seems to be doing ok, at least as far as the random \nvoltage generator goes, and it seems to be more stable with the higher \ncapacity batteries. I added RF amplifiers to the radio front ends, there&#39;s \ntwo, one AM, and the shortwave converter.\n\nI used a Japanese shortwave broadcast as raw audio the other day, and got \nsome interesting voices. I&#39;ll see if I can get some of that copied. I&#39;ve \nbeen busy during the day with another recumbent bike for the older Grand \nson, then I work on my boards at night, I stayed up til 2:30 this morning.\n\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nThe MSN Entertainment Guide to Golden Globes is here.
