&gt; I am aware that you cannot copyright the radio shack box, but can 
you possible copyright the plans and include the box as a piece of 
euipment used to build your original creation? I would do a quick 
copyright, throw the plans in an envelope and next day mail them to 
yourself. I , myself have done this with artwork and it does hold up 
in court or at least in MI. Aside from that, you have everyone here 
to vouch for you, in addition to the group e-mails. 
&gt; 
&gt; People never fail to surprise me . . . I am certain you have a 
world of support Mike!!
