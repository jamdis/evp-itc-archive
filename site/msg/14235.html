I have a question, how does anyone know where to fine someone's files to  
hear them in esnips?  I can just keep them on my pc, or put them on the  
extra drive, or post then take them down each time, I've been getting some  
really cool stuff, now, there was a really funny one, this lady's voice came on  
and says, "are you ghost hunting." lol I told her yes, I need them 
volunteers to  help me clean up this house. My ghosts so far are very nice, even one 
said "i  love you." that was sweet.  Love them too. <s>

LOL Snowfire! Nope it was not you this time. Others should read before they 
 post because we just addressed this subject. Esnips is very easy to use it 
has  two uploading options in case you cant use the java application use 
the single  file uploader. Works a lot like email upload attachments.

If you need  more help just holler and I am sure one of us will be more 
than willing to  help you figure it out. Posting from email as an attachment 
also works just  not so well for the very large file sizes. There are many 
other file sharing  storage places besides esnips. We just like the layout 
there and the ability  to share with friends including sharing storage space.
