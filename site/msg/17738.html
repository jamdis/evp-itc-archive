<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was on a show called &quot;Mystery Hunters&quot; a couple years ago with FB #36 and i didn&#x27;t get paid anything at all.  No gas, travel expense or anything.  They did offer to buy me dinner though, but i had just ate.  So, i agree with that analogy.  I&#x27;ve also never got paid for any of my speaking events either.  I do this because i love and believe in the research, not for money.  I have a full time job, this is my passion.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Well, yes, and five years ago, I was getting $3k for being one of the speakers at weekend events.  The economy changes, sometimes dramatically, and our fees change accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; These days, most of what we do includes paying out-of-pocket for gas or airfare, plus motels of dubious distinction, en route.  At about 80% of events, no speaker&#x27;s fee is involved. (In case you&#x27;re wondering, the hotel or other meeting rooms where events are hosted... that&#x27;s where most of the money goes.)
&gt; 
&gt; Guest appearances on reality TV shows rarely pay anything at all. (Not such a great &quot;reality&quot;... huh? *chuckle and sigh*)  However, a TV appearance is a credential that can (usually just briefly) allow us to charge more for our services.
&gt; 
&gt; In boom or bust, we keep doing what we do. We aspire to earn enough when times are good, to keep the bills paid when they&#x27;re not so great.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t know anyone in this field who wouldn&#x27;t rather be doing something else, preferably with a steady paycheck.  We do this because we can&#x27;t NOT do it.  If anyone is getting rich in this field, I have yet to meet them.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t want sympathy, but I also don&#x27;t want someone digging through my 11+ year old website, finding a page with my old fees, and deciding I&#x27;m doing this for the money. 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m on this list to learn about the box, and similar devices.  I want to understand what they do, why we hear impossibly consistent voices on them, how to improve the results, and what the significance of this is.
&gt; 
&gt; I can&#x27;t remain silent when someone suggests that a fellow researcher is money motivated.  But really, let&#x27;s get back on-topic.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; Fiona
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Yes it is going off topic, but just to make sure all the facts are here:
