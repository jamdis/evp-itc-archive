It&#39;s just been my experience that when I get these dates/prediction and ask questions about it, &quot;they&quot; give all kinds of bogus crap that &quot;they&quot; swear is true and 100% acurate. Very frustraitng!\n\n I can get some cussing and name calling voices that tends to show it&#39;s not broadcast fragments, or imagination, and I have gotten a couple things as predictions, that I didn&#39;t post cuz it seemed rediculous, but turned out true. \n\n F-S\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rj &lt;rasterer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for posting the results.  But, I don&#39;t think it was a real test anyway, since nothing specific was given before the event.  And it&#39;s too easy to retrofit vague predictions once a date has past.\n&gt; \n&gt; For the next test, to &#39;pin it down&#39;, I&#39;d recommend full details before the test.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Fri, 6/18/10, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] and----nothin&quot;!!\n&gt; To: evp-itc@yahoogroups.com, RTSC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, June 18, 2010, 7:04 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;        Well, it&#39;s the 18th and nothin&#39;!  Although we didn&#39;t really know what al the hub bub aobut the 17th was, just I was getting that repaetedly through the boxes. I think about the hard feelings created over this stuff, and just think WTF-over!  Does any of it mean anything? We get enough to show ourselves and some others that something is going on, somethign talks, but tha&#39;ts about all that can be said. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;  f-S\n&gt;"}
