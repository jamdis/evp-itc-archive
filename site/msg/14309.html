Here's the thing though - if you put something out there, and ask people to=
 listen to it, your inviting opinions. Some will be in agreement, and some =
won't, no matter what.

If EVP messages are for the one that recorded them,=
 then it shouldn't surprise you, or offend you, if someone doesn't hear the=
 same thing you do. If you don't want contrary opinions on something, then =
you should not give people the chance to critique.

Now I could see if some=
one flat out said your recordings were all trash, period. You would have ev=
ery right to be angry, but noone is saying that, at least I am not saying t=
hat.

I just stated that I did not hear what James heard, and though I wasn=
't going to say he doesn't have anything, I can't say that he does either.
