<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m a new member, I joined this group in hopes of learning about  
this EVP... hopefully much like what ghost hunters do on their show.
I am impressed at their &#x27;proof&#x27;.

I live in a house...with a bit of &#x27;unseen&#x27; activity.
we have only heard voices ourselves a few times...

I have watched things &#x27;move&#x27; in my front room many times  .... and 
know something must be there... and was interested in this EVP...
I have a small tape recorder... but have not picked up anything.

our activity comes and goes... I cant say its haunted, because it 
does not seem as tho something is &#x27;haunting&#x27; this house... 
instead I think something lives here along with us.
something that may have been here ages ago.

I just want proof of what we see and hear in this house .   
 and thought learning more about EVP might help us in this quest.
