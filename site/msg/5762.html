<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Gab,

I listened to the file and didn&#x27;t catch anything right away, so i 
downloaded your file and put it into cool edit and slowed it up and 
reversed it too.  I really don&#x27;t think that file says anything, you 
may have overprocessed that file too much to begin with.  If you send 
me a raw recording clip of a question and answer, i will be more than 
happy to go over it for you and than i will explain how i edited your 
file so you can do the same in the future.  Box files don&#x27;t need that 
much editing, i usually just ask a question and than cut out some of 
the in between static leaving just the answer.  And you really don&#x27;t 
need to edit the answers that much because it&#x27;s radio and clear 
already.  Sometimes i just slow it down maybe 10% and that&#x27;s it, and 
if it&#x27;s an answer in a distance i will raise the volume on just that 
section of the audio.  If you need any help, i&#x27;m here.
