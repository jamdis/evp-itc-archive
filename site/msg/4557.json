The doctors have given her just a few days to live.  Her family\n hopes to bring her home to care for her until her transition. If you \nwant to be kept up to date on this please email us back at ----------,\n otherwise we will post general information in a second broadcast.  Our\n prayers are with Sarah for an easy crossing. We know that there will be\n many who will be waiting to greet her.  Our prayers are also with her\n family to help them through this difficult time.\n\n\n\nTom and Lisa Butler&quot;\n\n\nGuy"}
