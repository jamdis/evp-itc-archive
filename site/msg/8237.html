Regarding 7.83 hz comment by Ron Lenderer. I wouldn't call it "woo-woo stuff". Try to reach 7.83 hz brainwave pattern while maintaining consciousness, a lot of odd things start to take place. The 7.8 hz frequency is also known as "The Schumann resonance". I took a snippet of the explanation from wikipedia regarding the Schumann resonance for you: 
"This global electromagnetic resonance phenomenon is named after physicist Winfried Otto Schumann who predicted it mathematically in 1952. Schumann resonance occurs because the space between the surface of the Earth and the conductive ionosphere acts as a waveguide. The limited dimensions of the Earth cause this waveguide to act as a resonant cavity for electromagnetic waves in the ELF band. The cavity is naturally excited by energy from lightning strikes. Schumann resonance modes are observed in the power spectra of the natural electromagnetic background noise, as separate peaks at extremely low frequencies (ELF) around 7.8, 14.3, 20.8, 27.3 and 33.8 Hz.
 The fundamental mode of the Schumann resonance is a standing wave in the Earth-ionosphere cavity with a wavelength equal to the circumference of the Earth. This lowest-frequency (and highest-intensity) mode of the Schumann resonance occurs at a frequency of approximately 7.8 Hz"

A while back when reading about the schumann resonance I came up with an interesting idea. I wanted to find a brainwave eeg that would do a tone biofeedback into an ear piece (right ear), then have the 7.8 hz tone being played infinitely through an ear piece in the left ear, and try to force myself to match my brainwaves to the schumann resonance through force of will. Having the real time feedback in tone form would drastically help to judge where one is at and if he/she is having any success changing his/her brainwaves. The idea is to passively listen while relaxing until one could get to the schumann resonance regarding the brainwaves and record the sensations/thoughts/experiences etc.. I haven't the time nor money to get a biofeedback eeg and actually give this a try, but for anyone who does and decides to let me know your results.

Is this just woo-woo stuff?  Would you think it has any relevance to EVP communications?   waddayathink    Ron L
