this one is very scary, I have not cleaned it up, I was asking about the  
antichrist, and if he was released yet, and they are saying, "yes, he has 
been  released, yes, he has, and that Christ is coming."  Please, don't  get 
left here, just believe in what JC did, and don't be left behind, "the  
teleport is going to be instantaneous," we won't feel a thing, one minute you  
will be sitting at a desk, next minute we will find our self in some grassy  
field is what I was told.  I have more, I haven't cleaned them up yet, but  
you can see how plain and clear they are from that newer RS that I messed up 
the  other day.  They are saying scary things on it, they said, he is not the 
 devil, that the antichrist is a "spirit energy" "worse then the devil," 
and will  "infect" posess some person after Obama.
