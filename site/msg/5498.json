I recieved two messages from john lennon, Right \nbefore I was set to post them lisby quotes lennon in a post to me.\n\npretty cool\n\nThe first file #11 where he says John it sounds like him\nthe second #11A is a little rougher but understandable.\n\nI posted them in the general files section, I&#39;ll only leave them till \nanyone who wants has had a chance to listen.\n\nBruce"}
