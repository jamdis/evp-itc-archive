I have been testing claimants of mediumship for many years. One of the cent=
ral issues we constantly deal with is identifying the source of the anomalo=
us information. First let's establish that "proof-oriented" research simply=
 will not answer this question. Proof-oriented research (such as does the s=
upposed discarnate know specifici information) has been used in the past to=
 establish that anomalous information transfer can occur. "Anomalous inform=
ation transfer" is a fancy way of saying that something is known somehow to=
 someone in a way that seems impossible. Mediums giving legitimate reading =
for sitters is one example, psychics having validated impressions is anothe=
r.
=A0
There=A0are other issues with proofs. One is that it appears that in=
formation does not come through well when tests are too "factual" or there =
is no real need. In other words, experiments motivated solely by a "prove i=
t" attitude, tend to fail. We think this is because of a form of experiment=
er effect. It has been observed that the attitudes of experimenters, especi=
ally in psychological research, can actually influence outcomes. A famous o=
f experiments performed by Dr. Richard Wiseman and Dr. Marilyn Schlitz demo=
nstrated this conclusively.
=A0
Given these points, how to proceed? The ans=
wer lies in "process-oriented" research. Instead of worrying about proving =
things, especially since we already know that we can get proof of anomalous=
 information transfer, we focus on how the process seems to work and not wo=
rk. This gives us clues as to what might be going on and ultimately go give=
 us greater confidence as to the source of the information. Note that I sai=
d, "could" as in the future, as in we don't really know now. That is the st=
ate of the art at this time. So we don't have=A0a way today to determine th=
is yet. 
=A0
There are some other things you should know. There are three k=
nown ways that apparent discarnate communications might be explained. These=
 have been touched on in this and other threads, but it might be useful to =
review.
=A0
The first is known as "telepathy" or "thought transference". It=
 involves two living people sharing thoughts. Most ESP tests are contrived =
with the expectation of demonstrating telepathy. But there is a little prob=
lem. They can as easily demonstrate "clarivoyance" which is the second know=
 way of communicating. Clairvoyance (which literally means "clear seeing") =
is a supposed ability that some have to see things that either are, were or=
 will be. Some people hear things instead of seeing them, this known as cla=
iraudience. In fact any sense can be appealed to in this way. The point is =
that an actual event is being sensed and reported. So in the clairvoyant ex=
ample, you are simply showing that someone might have known of an event in =
the past (when you recorded something for example), in the present (what's =
on a paper you placed in a location without looking yourself) or in the fut=
ure (when the contents of the paper were discovered).
This problem was solv=
ed nicely in 1936 by Dr. Elizabeth McMann at Duke University when she devel=
oped the "true telepathy test." Simply put, the test requires that no targe=
t ever be recorded per se. Instead aliases for target are kept in memory an=
d the aliases compared post hoc. This way there is never=A0a physcial recor=
d of the actual targets - the only place the target object information exis=
ts is in the minds of the subjects. So telepathy must be in play if success=
es are found and clairvoyance is effectively ruled out. One small detail th=
ough, subjects can NEVER discuss the actual test objects throughout their l=
ifetimes or the test will be invalidated as precognitive clairvoyance could=
 then become an explanation.
=A0
Even if you didn't fully understand the pr=
eceding paragraphy, I hope you can see that tests of this sort are not triv=
ial, and imposing proper controls is sort of an art form.
=A0
Of course the=
 third explanation for anomalous information transfer is based on After-Dea=
th Communication or ADC which is the unique provenance of the medium (as op=
posed to a psychic). 
=A0
I hope this is of some interest.
