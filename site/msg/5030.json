I just \nwonder if they know just how hard we are trying.  If anyone seen my \noriginal set up, I would have been committed into the funny farm.  I \nhad tinfoil attached to an antenna hanging out my window just to get \ngood reception.  As crazy as it sounds, If that was the only way to \nget a good session, then I was doing it!
