Only three investigators were present in the room.\n&gt; Their voices have been properly taken into account and ruled out as\n&gt; sources of the actual EVPs.\n&gt;\n&gt; The new and resampled EVPs have been saved as .mp3 files. They can be\n&gt; freely downloaded from the site here -\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.filecrunch.com/user/orbhunterx\n&gt;\n&gt; You will hear quite a few odd words, dog barks, and even mimicry.\n&gt; Some of the voices are faint and whispery. Other EVP voices sound\n&gt; like the invisibles are standing right along side the researchers!\n&gt;\n&gt; Sexual Content Warning:\n&gt;\n&gt; Several of the EVPs have strong sexual content.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please read the file name prior to downloading.\n&gt;\n&gt; Listening to the EVPs will be at your own disgression.\n&gt;\n&gt; That stated, those that choose to listen to the EVPs, please let me\n&gt; know if any of them need further contextual clarification. I look\n&gt; forward to hearing feedback. As it stands, the true nature of what&#39;s\n&gt; going on in the house awaits much more serious attention.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; Lance Oliver, Founder\n&gt; Denton Area Paranormal Society\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\nI'd eally like o lis en o hese, bu when I y o open hem, I ge no hing a all.
