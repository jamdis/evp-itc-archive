Wish I had a Frank's box, so I could put a little magical thingie  into it =

so spirit could talk easier <g> it isn't a crystal  either<s> one thing I'=
ve 
noticed is sometimes the voice I hear is that of  the person I knew, so=
 it 
can't be just all them using sounds, when my mom speaks  it her voice,=
 when 
a friend of mine spoke it was her voice as well.  What I  might do i=
f i have 
time later is to ask for certain people to talk, if they are  nea=
r by maybe 
they will.

The running theory i=

 (whatever that ma=
y be) in or to modulate or demodulate (change) the signal 
to  form communi=
cation. A lot of the radios are used (Frank's box, shack 
hacks,  minibox o=
r whatever) because they put out a complex noise signal with 
a lot of  hum=
an voice tones in them. It is thought that it would be easier 
for them to =
 manipulate the voice tones than to try to manipulate random 
noise.

I  pe=
rsonally use silence to record, which really isn't silence at all but 
just=
  ambient room noise. The signal is run through certain filters and I 
get =
pretty  good solid speech. I have worked with different setups such as the =

hacks and  the like but prefer the more basic forms that, to me are more 
=
reliable and  less questionable.

No matter what you decide to use to recor=
d they will  all work to some 
extent in the end. All you need to communica=
te is the will,  desire and an 
interested entity around you.

Fr=

 Misty said the ghost modulates?  But I've also  heard it said it is not 
t=
he noise, but the words, that the ghosts select from  the broadcasts?   And=
 
some people say that it is something more  ephrmeral, that every hears 
d=
ifferently because it has t to be meant for each  individual.
