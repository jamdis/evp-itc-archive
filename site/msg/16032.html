<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Although I realize your question was for Frank, I believe the other fine developers and the folks who attended the QM event would take exception to being characterized as people who can&#x27;t be honest. But it was nice to see how the audience and other presenters cheered loudly when Frank was introduced. Frank&#x27;s work also was constantly considered to be one of the most influential of modern day ITC.

&gt; Frank,
&gt; I have meaning to ask you what you thought of the other inventors
&gt; that were on the Queen Mary with you?
&gt; Were there some good ideas, or did you think they were full of crap ?
&gt;  Was there anyone you were a little impressed with?
&gt; Your probably the only person that would be honest about it.....

&gt;  Picked up another RCA alarm clock radio yesterday for $3. It&#x27;s
&gt; hackable, although I&#x27;ll convert it to a box tuner by removing the
&gt; processor board. Cost is the motivator, this tuner is $3, ---for the TRF
&gt; box, just the tuning diodes are $6, the TRF chip $1.50( i think), the
&gt; pcb board $20, plus maybe $20 for the rest of the parts, and that&#x27;s not
&gt; including assembly. Trouble is, I can&#x27;t find a ready supply of re-usable
&gt; tuners. This sounds alot better after it&#x27;s converted.
