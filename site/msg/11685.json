So I can set it for 1600 for \nlow-light shots and no flash.\n\nIf you&#39;re taking flash pictures you probably need to set the shutter at \nwhatever the manufacturer recommends and use other appropriate settings. \nMy Canon F-1 uses 1/125 second for the flash setting.\n\nIf you&#39;re not taking flash photos, get the fastest film you can find.  I \nthink Kodak has an ISO 800 color film available.  I used to use some B&W \nKodak film with a ridiculously fast speed like 3200 but it was super \ngrainy and you had to make absolutely sure your darkroom was totally \ndark when you put it in the developing tank.\n\nI calculated that my digital SLR would pay for itself just in lack of film \nand developing costs when I got to around 2500 photos with it.  I&#39;ve gone \nway past that in less than two years.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Mon, 11 Aug 2008, Chad wrote:\n\n&gt; Hey Guys,\n&gt;\n&gt; Any of you still use a 35mm to take pictures with? I have 2 of them\n&gt; and tried over the weekend to utilize them in an investigation. The\n&gt; exposure time on these things is like 30 seconds. It&#39;s such a pain in\n&gt; the butt. If you do use the 35mm, what kind of settings do you use?\n&gt; Any advice? I am totally new to night photography. Has everyone gone\n&gt; to digital now or what?\n&gt;\n&gt; Chad\n&gt;"}
