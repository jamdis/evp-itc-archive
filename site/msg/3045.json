I can&#39;t seem to convey a fairly simple principle thought that is shared by many of my colleagues and peers the world over.  Ah,  well,  it&#39;s not really important in the short-haul anyway.  Let me assure you Frank-S,  none of my intensions were to personally attack anyone!  I do attack ideas and statements that I strongly feel are blatantly wrong, mis-construeing and apt to mis-lead if left to themselves, especially to the lay-person.  I am obviously opposed in my &quot;philosophy&quot; by several persons who,  in my opinion,  are prejudiced against those of us who are more open-minded concerning perceptions, analysis, experience, objectivity and etc. concerning the Paranormal.  This is,  of course,  S.O.P.  and expected.  Don&#39;t be so sensitive,  open up and enjoy the contension.     --Rod\n   \n   \n       \n\nFrank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n           Most of the people here that post voices get interactive communication.

As far as me not watching ghost shows on tv, \nit seems by your explanation of how you have been involved in the PI \nfield that you are a lot like those cheesy ghost hunting shows. To \nmake a statement that spirits are not interactive and could care less \nabout us or what we are trying to do, that alone shows you know \nnothing. I am a disabled rescue worker injured in the 911 attacks and \nam home all day with plenty of time for research and I can \nimphatically tell you that they do pay attention they do interact \nthey are definitely interested and they are working harder than we \nare to communicate. \n\nmaybe you have formed your opinion because in your vast wealth of \nknowledge and experience you have never come across a spirit that was \ninterested in you. besides throwing you all around a room or lifting \nyou into the air and hurling you like a shot put or whatever you \nclaim some ghosts did. And if they did do that to you that sounds \npretty interactive to me. I can see why they would want to throw you \naround and kick and bite you but if I where you I would find another \nhobby.\nand I say hobby because by your analogy of it that&#39;s all it is to you.\n\nAs far as your friend with the mini box, yeah I&#39;m not stupid I \nfigured that out, you can stop trying to defend it no one here is \ngonna buy that piece of crap.\n\nI will not trade any more malicious posts with you so don&#39;t bother.\n\nBruce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n---------------------------------\n  Peek-a-boo FREE Tricks Treats for You!
