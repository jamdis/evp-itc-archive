and=
 you try to twist them into: "you have not had any luck on the box so right=
 
away it doesn't work. Or there has to be a some foul play involved. "

Ri=

You asked s=

1) you hope what? that =

=

I hope you called it in. Your resistance to giving the police information =
you said you thought you had on a child abductor, even after several prompt=

om prompting you. I don't know of course, I am not there. I have no desire =
that you make a fool of yourself, but if it helps save a child from am abdu=

 has shown me nothing paranormal yet.=C2=A0 However, people continue to say=

3) Why are negative =
people on
 these lists anyway. if you guys don't believe in this type of te=

If I had absolulely no belief th=

=C2=A0 How could a person, of good conscience, not prompt you to give that =
information to the police?=C2=A0 Again how is that a negative thing to do?

Wouldn't the really negative thing be to ignore it?
