I seem to remember the selectivity wasnt too good, but I may have had too much gain happening.\nPresently been playing with a head-less 12-469, which seems quite good and also quiet in between stations. I guess you rate the MK484 better due to it having no mixer noise?\nI found an article on the ZN414, and thought I should share it, as its got a new slant on RF Gain control, by tapping down the AGC feedback via a pot. It should allow much greater control of the chips response to strong signals.
