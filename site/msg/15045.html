<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You can create a wave in anything. You can create a wave in a rope by having
a person hold each end and then having one person wiggle the rope. You can
create a wave in a lake by dropping a rock into it. The thing that carries
the wave is the propagating medium. In these examples it&#x27;s the rope and
water respectively.

In the case of sound, the propagating medium is the air. It is a
longitudinal pressure wave. It cannot be picked up on a receiver that is
capable of receiving the same frequencies as electromagnetic waves.

There are receivers and antennas that can pick up electromagnetic waves of
the same frequencies as sound waves. But in this case, the propagating
medium is the aether. They are transverse electromagnetic waves and you
can&#x27;t hear them.
The electromagnetic spectrum extends from sub-audible frequencies all the
way up to the frequencies of X-rays and cosmic rays. Different methods exist
to detect or receive different parts of this spectrum. I&#x27;m involved in a ULF
group that specializes in receiving electromagnetic waves of the Schumann
resonances which are around 6 Hz, plus or minus.

&gt; A mistake that a lot of people make is thinking that there are two
&gt; different types of energy at work when it comes to sound waves and
&gt; electromagnetic waves. The only thing that seperates them is frequency and
&gt; power. Radio waves are radio waves because they occupy a certain block of
&gt; the electromagnietic spectrum. Sound waves exist on that same spectrum just
&gt; farther down with much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic waves can
&gt; penetrate almost anything because of their wavelengths. The shorter the
&gt; wavelength the more ways we can shield against them.
&gt;
&gt; Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and telemetry
&gt; transmitting wave but the waves also have a physical effect on our
&gt; environment by causing molecules to speed up, which creates heat. A little
&gt; lower than this is IR or infrared it too can cause physical objects to heat
&gt; up but usually it just causes molecules to rotate in place. All physical
&gt; things give off IR light. Its a way the total system conserves energy by
&gt; spontaneously emitting IR radiation.

&gt;
&gt;   Here is some food for thought. I am currently reviewing my audio from
&gt; our May 30th investigation.
&gt;
&gt; It was me and another girl teammate present in the room. I picked up a 3rd
&gt; female voice on my digital voice recorder that I carry with me. We were
&gt; standing right next to another digital video recorder that I leave beside my
&gt; night vision camera. That recorder did not pick up this 3rd voice. I have
&gt; asked the girl that was with me to check her recording to see if she picked
&gt; it up.
&gt;
&gt; I have long felt the true EVP does not come from sound waves in the
&gt; environment, or then it wouldn&#x27;t be EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow
&gt; EVP&#x27;s are appearing directly on the recordings.
&gt;
&gt; This instance with the recorders may back that theory up. That other
&gt; recorder should have picked that voice up if it were sound waves in the
&gt; environment.
&gt;
&gt; I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. The file that is named &quot;01-02-17
&gt; Clip&quot; is the full clip. You will hear my voice as I say &quot;Yeah&quot;, and then
&gt; another comes in right after that. I think I know what it says.
&gt;
&gt; Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but still did not hear this until
&gt; playback. It isn&#x27;t clear, so I am not as excited about it as my one&#x27;s from
&gt; the last investigation.

&gt;
&gt;     I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and
&gt; demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It works off the
&gt; heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one
&gt; another in frequency then if you add or subtract them together you get a
&gt; beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sending a
&gt; signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating an
&gt; untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate
&gt; difference frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to
&gt; 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates
&gt; ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt
&gt; that EVP were generated within a few inches of the recorder.
&gt;
&gt; We are able to reproduce this affect in not only radio with superheterodyne
&gt; systems but also with acoustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a
&gt; commercial produce called the &quot;audio spotlight&quot; by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.

&gt;   Fascinating! I&#x27;ve had this idea that the EVP are often not recorded by
&gt; the microphone but somehow make their way in at the actual point where the
&gt; storage is made, whether it be analog (tape) or digital.
&gt; So much we don&#x27;t know ...

&gt;&gt;  I monitor my audio live. The funny thing is that even so, those last
&gt;&gt; EVP&#x27;s I captured I did not hear either in the environment, or on my
&gt;&gt; recording as it happened. I only heard them upon playback.

&gt;&gt;   I am curious if anyone with a microphone wired to a remote site has
&gt;&gt; ever gotten any EVP in real time.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I took part in an investigation of Ashmore Estates, near Ashmore IL, on
&gt;&gt; Saturday night. We had six video cameras set up in the three halls of the
&gt;&gt; building. The video for all was being monitored and recorded at a central
&gt;&gt; location. Alas, we did not have microphones at the camera sites conected to
&gt;&gt; the central location. I wonder what we might have heard if we did?
