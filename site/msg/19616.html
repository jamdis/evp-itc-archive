I've seen live webcast of ITC sessions w=

dobe Audition with the spectragraph running. It was really compelling to se=

the graph. At first it was I thought it was a software glitch but it is a r=
epeatable event. It was on LiveSciFi which is run by Tim Wood, he also thou=
ght there was some kind of code error but it happened on more than one webc=
ast. 

So if anyone has Audition, just feed Box output right in your comput=
er and see what happens. I wanted to try it tonight but I have Audacity and=
 the spectragraph feature doesn't have that shaded appearance that Audition=
 does so it's not able to render images or characters, at least as far as I=
 see using the various settings.
