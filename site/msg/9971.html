William,
 
With all do respect and I do mean that. 
 
You are a newbie and=
 you just started box research.
You are pursuing this subject quite passion=
ately.
 
If you feel that you have been misled in any advice or representat=
ion here.
Go back and look at the posts from when you first started asking =
questions.
 
you will note that I have always said that the "CRAP" was cut =
from my files
and even have recommended audio programs to new researchers f=
or that specific purpouse.
 
And you seem to be under the misconception tha=
t because you take out the blips and blurbs
that the message or answer some=
how changes, no it does not!
 
the message is the same only the bits of noi=
se crap are gone.
It's like you speaking a sentence once and coughing in th=
e middle, and then repeating the sentence without coughing.
It's the same s=
entence with the same meaning, minus the cough.
 
William, I like you and y=
our dedication to learning this research, but you are still learning and sh=
ould take in subjects like this and digest them
before arguing the point wi=
th much more experienced researchers.
 
Again no disrespect meant, just som=
e advice from a friend.

My point is let everybody know that the cl=

you get messages that long without all the bullshit.  They might wander why=
 they can't get a messages like that.  I think I been somewhat mis lead mys=

Hi all,just a general comment on editing EVP:=
 For scientific reasons, I wouldsuggest not to edit an EVP message partiall=
y, but only as a whole, inorder to rule out any possible suspicion of manip=
ulation. You can forinstance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire c=
lip (includingthe experimenter's voice), filter or denoise it to make it cl=
earer, butnot cut out individual pieces (supposed "garbage") to make an EVP=
 matchwith what it "should be". At least, the unedited version should alway=
sbe provided along with the edited version.But that's only my personal opin=
ion which I thought I had to express, aswe should always be able to present=
 our results to a critical public.Stefan-- > Believe or not Ron, very littl=
e editing is involved for these files.> After my question, i isolate the re=
sponse section and slow that > section down about 20%. Now i can actually s=
tart to hear the message > a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections =
of just noise that > don't belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can'=
t piece these > files together to make something it's not, so i keep them i=
n true > form pretty much to the original.> -Steve> --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogro=
