<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Ron,

I&#x27;m really glad someone is working with the Ovilus and letting those
of us who haven&#x27;t purchased it know what you&#x27;ve found out concerning
the pros and cons. I&#x27;d appreciate it though if we could keep the forum
free of political statements and opinions, that is of course, unless
you&#x27;re knocking Obama. lol

Thanks,

Chad

&gt; From one user, here are a few things I have issues with.  
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Unit only works off a 9 volt battery...no ac or other dc options
possible.  My battery goes down fast and they are not cheap and I know
of no way to recharge this type of battery.  Also, the battery seems
to drain even when not used (I mentioned this to Bill).
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Mode selection at times does not change the mode when button is
pressed.  I often have to push the mode select many times to get it to
move to the next mode.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  Dictonary mode seems to not offer anything but repeat words. 
Have not checked this very closely yet but I hear repeating words and
names...especially... Larry...often.  I have no confidence in this mode.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.  The phonemes and mix mode seem very limited in that I often do
not get any &quot;energy&quot; reading to allow sounds to be emitted. Although I
try to conduct my sessions in a calm mode myself, apparently I don&#x27;t
have enough energy around me to get a consistant energy reading. 
&gt; 
&gt; 5.  Never tested other modes to determine value or usefulness except
for the yes/no and I found this to be totally out of touch.  Somethng
like McCain...sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; I do intend to work with the concepts Jeff put forth...but first I
need to go buy more batteries.  Also, I will dig out a clip I have
from one of my sessions and post it hear.  Maybe you can help me with
translation.  Ron
