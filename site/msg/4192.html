<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Do you have to have it in a sound chamber?  Or would a quiet room 
work?  I saw the video on building the sound chamber for under $100, 
and may go that route--thank you for the info.

&gt; Rita, I think you will have to get a pair of amplified speakers on 
&gt; that 469, and put them in a sound chamber of some sort.  In that 
&gt; chamber, you will want probably an amplified microphone running 
into 
&gt; your voice recorder, to pick up the sounds bouncing around in 
there.  
&gt; You can also add some white noise into the box, but I think people 
&gt; are getting results without adding the additional noise. The 
chamber 
&gt; seems to really bounce the sound around and give you a good mix to 
&gt; record.

&gt; &gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; New to group here.  We just completed the advance hack on our 469 
&gt; &gt; model.  Are you supposed to hear the voices from the radio 
stations 
&gt; or 
&gt; &gt; just white noise?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also, is it best to hook up an external speaker, one or two, in 
&gt; order 
&gt; &gt; to record to a digital recorder?  What is the best way to record, 
&gt; using 
&gt; &gt; digital recorder, or direct into PC using Sound recorder, and 
using 
&gt; a 
&gt; &gt; line in/line out connection?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What is the recommended length of sessions.  Should I try just a 
&gt; minute 
&gt; &gt; or two, or longer at one sitting?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks to all!
&gt; &gt; Rita
