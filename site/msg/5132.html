Thanks for the encouragement Bruce.  You are correct I have a rs 12-469 and I cut the pin so it scans continually when needed.   I at times used audacity on my computer to record, thinking that speed control would be useful to interpret messages...nice thought.   I like the simplicity of your suggestion to just plug the radio directly into the digital recorder.  Not knowing exactly how all this goes down, I thought the radio scan sounds need to mix in the room so that the techs on the other side can respond.  Whatever works.  
   
  The other main question I have is regarding the radio stations I can pick up here in my part of Mexico, on the Yucatan.  I only get several stations during a complete scan of all a.m. or f.m. channels...don't know if that is enough.  It has been suggested that I somehow can add an antenna to search for more channels, which I would attempt if it is really necessary.  I get mostly Spanish language stations and an occasional station from Texas that skips across the Gulf of Mexico.  Not much to scan.  Any thoughts on this?
   
  By the way, I think the work you are doing is, well, extraordinary.    Like pros from any other field of endeavor, you make this stuff look easy to do...not so.  Thanks again.   Ron L

          Hey Ron L.,
 
In my experience it does not matter what language you recieve the signal in.
The entities are using only fragments, small bits and pieces of the radio signal
to form the words. Therefore it does not matter if the radio signal is in spanish 
or english or any other language for that matter.
 
Our friends on the other side will manipulate the fragments they need to communicate 
with you in the language you will understand.
 
Ron you mention that you are using an rs 690 that is not one of the hack model numbers 
maybe you have gotten the wrong radio model. Check the part number it must be a 12-469
or a 12-470 and if it is the 470 it would have to be the older model or it could not be modified.
 
Can you verify that you have modified the rs radio and that it is continually scanning without
stopping on any one particular station?
 
Also there would be no need for EVP maker or a microphone to be used during a session with the RS box
all you would need is the RS box and a digital recorder, if you have the 469 you would need speakers to 
record the session or plug the digital recorder directly into the radio.
 
Please check your equipment and how it is operating and let me know so I can help you further.
Don't worry they are just waiting for you to set up the correct equipment and they will communicate.
 
Bruce

      Bruce, I now have done a few days testing with my rs 690, evp maker, audacity, a mic, and my handheld digital recorder.  Nada, nothing, zilch.  Maybe because I only get to scan past 5 to 8 channels on Am or FM so I don't have enough signals to muster a response.  But from what you and others with experience seem to be saying, it shouldn't matter because I will get help from someone on the other-side.  Maybe they can't find me in Mexico?  Please let your techs know I am here...should be no problem with immigration papers or money exchange.  I really need help.  Ron L

That may be, But I find that when I do a session mike and lisa both come through but mike seems to be the more dominant one.
 
I have asked that mike and lisa help in your sessions as well as other new researchers and they seem to comply but I think mike
is more like a supervisor and delegates actions to other techs. I know that if you do not have a perminent tech that whatever tech
is available at the time you do your session will be assigned to assist you. If it is lisa she is very sweet and will do her best to give you 
solid communication. I'm glad she can help.

      I'm getting the thought that Lisa is bouncing around between us. She's very dominant every time I run a session and I've gotten some good stuff from her, which I will shortly be able to post, I hope. About a week ago, I got a really extraordinary sequence that ran something along the lines of a male saying, "Lisa, can you do it?" followed by a clear female voice saying, "Testing. Beginning. Ground," and then a second female voice saying "Kick." I was floored.

Anyway, Lisa seems to be the driver of a lot of what is going on right now. Maybe she intends to work with a number of us?

        Frank,
 
I have two techs that I speak with on a daily basis and one of them
is Lisa. She could possibly be contacting you with the technical info she tried to give me
yesterday.

      I've been getting Lisa too, but so far not in any segments tranfered 
to the PC. Even tonight I heard her, but not while I was taping.
