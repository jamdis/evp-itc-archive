&gt; I realize that the clip is long but it is a good example of hearing
&gt; them real time and responding back and forth for those that need to
&gt; hear an example of that. 
&gt; I was trying to end the session and I missed the PLEASE DONT real time
&gt; but I heard them say WAIT. They then say DONT LEAVE YET. I even hear
&gt; them say HURRY! 
&gt; There is some more back and forth while we try to get everyone back
&gt; over. I must drive them crazy because on playback I hear done complete
&gt; and here a bunch but eventually I here them and end the session.
&gt; Its over at ESNIPS because the file is too large for here.
&gt; Check it out:
