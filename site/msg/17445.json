Still, we wouldn&#39;t SEE it for 500\n&gt;&gt; years. And the equipment described by Hodowanec (which I&#39;ve built) can&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; tell us WHERE the supernova occurred, just the fact it did.\n&gt;&gt; Zack\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Wed, Jun 2, 2010 at 10:10 AM, draiga1 &lt;blackwing@cox. net&lt;http://mc/compose?to=blackwing@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Fiona,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry to butt in, but I&#39;m curious. If this is happening 500 Light Years\n&gt;&gt;&gt; away from us, doesn&#39;t that mean it will be visible to us in 500 years? I\n&gt;&gt;&gt; know that there is a delay with sound such as thunder, then the delay before\n&gt;&gt;&gt; an individual hears it depending on how far they are from where the sound\n&gt;&gt;&gt; originated.
