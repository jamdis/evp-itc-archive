<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Chad, I went to Big Lots and got a cheap looking portable set of
speakers. It was about $7 but it was probably the most portable they
had. It is an all-in-one speaker set. The speaker is small, white, and
oval shaped. It has both the left and right speaker and plugs directly
into the radio and just sits on top of it. It has a little power-on
switch on top and is powered by two AAA batteries. The brand name of
it is &quot;Kinyo,&quot; which I have never heard of. Even though it was a no
name brand as far as I could tell, it gave me the results that I had
in the cemetery and in my opinion it&#x27;s the ultimate in portability
that I have seen.

&gt; I went over to BigLots and got a set of Audio Zone 2.0 amplified
speakers for about 6 bucks. They are 2W each with a 3&quot; full range
driver, pre-amplified and magnetically shielded. Frequency response is
120Hz-20KHz. Are these just total crap, or are they comparable to what
you&#x27;re talking about? Man, I just wish I could run the mic and the 469
into the recorder with the y-adapter.

&gt; 
&gt; The 469 uses a very low powered amplifier circuit on the headphone 
&gt; jack.  Stand computer speakers will not really work for it and you
will get 
&gt; a very low audio out of it if anything.  What you need is a small
set of 
&gt; amplified speakers.  Radio Shack sells a few seats that fold up for
around 
&gt; $20.00.  I got mine when they were on sale for $10.00.  Or any good 
&gt; amplified speakers will do the job for you.  But remember the
clocking on 
&gt; am.  The clicking will be amplified too so try and ignore it if 
&gt; possible.

&gt; I hooked up these speakers and now I&#x27;m not getting a thing. I guess
&gt; I&#x27;m  using poor quality speakers. any suggestions on which speakers
&gt; work the  best with the 469?
