One of the questions I asked was, &quot;When a person dies, do they see a white light?&quot;  After I asked this question the second time, I got a very distinct and crisp YES.  How can I save just that section of the file? Do I need to do that in the recorder, or can I do it in the .wave file I now have saved on my computer of the whole recording.\n   \n  Mike Edwards Cary, NC\n\n       \n---------------------------------\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?
