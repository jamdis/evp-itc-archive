In my opinion. You just create fear with that crap, and\n&gt;\n&gt; fear feeds itself. Once again, you will create what you expect to\n&gt;\n&gt; get. If you use protection BS, you&#39;ll have convinced yourself that\n&gt;\n&gt; there is something to be affraid of, and so you will tend to creat a\n&gt;\n&gt; thoughtform to fulfill that expectation.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;"}
