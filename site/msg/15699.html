Yeah I think so too. It's the same with the other methods. Some days are be=
tter than others. Maybe it has to do with the surrounding conditions as wel=
l as our own energy levels. Not sure why sometimes they come in very clear =
and other times not so great.

I first tried EVP b=

So by this, do you mean it's possible it takes a couple of sessions for the=
 entity to master this new method of communication? For instance, I got my =
grandmother' s name (among others) during Tuesday's session, but she said n=
othing, wouldn't answer our questions; Wednesday, she suddenly started talk=
ing and was the primary person we communicated with, even correctly answere=
d my mother's questions about her childhood pets. Could this be because the=
re's a learning curve involved with talking through the radio? Does it take=
 a session or two before they "get the hang of it"? Or is it all dependent =
on my skills?

such trouble to tell you all that again and again -- what's to gain from it=
? It's not stirring anybody up.
