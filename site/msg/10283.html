<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hmm just walked in from long day at work to this blahh

Bruce, I see you have already unjoined. But ok, I checked it out, and 
I checked the mod log completely the past week. Bruce at no time were 
any of your messages deleted or rejected. You may have had a few 
marked as spam that sat in the groups spam folder until one of those 
mods you are accusing of withholding, approved it and it was posted.

When messages get denied or rejected or deleted...I see it... I see 
everything a mod does including myself. You guys have been allowed to 
speak freely. Sorry that I have to work and cant be here every time 
that you guys post and approve the message when yahoo marks it as 
spam. I cant help that. I have posted many many times on this subject 
and I am not going to defend yahoo&#x27;s dorky determination of what is 
or isnt spam. Ya would think that a member marked as UNMODERATED 
wouldnt get messages marked as spam but it DOES happen. The more 
members this group gets the longer and more detailed the response 
chain becomes and most of Bruces posts get marked as spam as do some 
of the other members here. Sorry bout that.

As for the rest... I think others here have said the exact words I 
would (and would not) say so repeating them would just be an &quot;echo&quot; =)

As for &quot;real box research&quot; being done for more than an hour ehhh ok 
LOL I hope you do realize it looked like you are talking about the 
FIRST box user. I know you are aware that this tool has been tested 
by Sumption in more detail than any one here will ever comprehend. 

As for Ratka if I even try to explain half the things that man has 
tested just in the past year, my head may pop off and roll around 
from sheer lack of technical knowledge to explain in detail. out of 
breath just typing that LOL.

Just because people dont agree with each other it isnt an attack 
necessarily. They are grown people and they can state thier opinions. 
Sometimes they differ. I have no more control over what they say than 
I do you. You all state your minds pretty freely here and I dont 
always agree with you all. But usually we agree that we disagree on 
the subject and move on to the next. 

Theres alot more miscommunication and BS going on than gets posted on 
this forum. And to be honest there just isnt enough time in my day to 
waste going thru the psychodramas some of yall have got going on out 
there LOL but dont think that I am not aware of some of it. I am more 
aware than ya may think =)

I choose to try and keep a positive focus for myself as well as all 
of you. Even if I dont agree with everything you guys say LOL

It would be nice if we all agreed all the time and who knows maybe 
one day we will.  LOL hey it could happen!!! But until that day we 
can at least be respectful to each other and work with those who are 
like minded individuals rather than focusing on the negativity of 
wasting our time on those who aren&#x27;t.
