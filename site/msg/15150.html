A similar thing happened to me on our last investigation too.

  There's another possibility=
: possibly the spirits involved only wish to impart sounds to a particular =
unit or units.

  I was surprised on one investigation I was on to get most=
ly all the same EVP on my DVR, which was hanging from my belt, and my camco=
rder, which was in front of my face. Other people on the investigation didn=
't get them at all. Go figure! 
  :-)

            Hi, 
            I believe I saw an explaination on this=
 list about why if you have 2 recorders sitting side by side, why may one c=
apture an EVP on one and not the other? Someone was explaining about an ene=
rgy field like a bubble. 
            I'm trying to explain this theory to =
a friend. Can someone help me? 
            Thanks Laura
