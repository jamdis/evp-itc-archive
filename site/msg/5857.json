Set-up a certain time to run sessions \n&gt; weekly. Let&#39;s say you could do it Monday -Thursday at 10:00 AM for \n&gt; example. This way, an expectation is set and a plan is in order. \n&gt; Keep recording small sessions and then analyze them. Ask questions, \n&gt; simple basic questions for responses each day. Don&#39;t give up. I \n&gt; pesonally have noticed this has helped me and something is building \n&gt; with the contacts and quality of the messages. For me it began with \n&gt; a staggered &quot;Yes,&quot; and other one words occasionally. Now I am \n&gt; hearing sentences and very intelligable responses that I know are \nnot \n&gt; radio bit coincidences. The biggest help any of us can give you is \n&gt; to remain patient and continue experimenting, looking for not only \n&gt; what works for you, but giving those on the other side time to find \n&gt; you and get a message or two across. It will come - I am certain of \n&gt; it.\n&gt; \n&gt; For some reason, the amount of audio bits seem to help with the \n&gt; communication, as I can tell...even when I have received EVP-like \n&gt; messages above or over the audio bits in the background. I do not \n&gt; understand why. Here are two ideas I have for you to pick up more \nAM \n&gt; audio:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Try an AM antenna booster (Radio Shack sells them. I think Juli \n&gt; has had some success with hers).\n&gt; 2) You may try more than one hacked radio sweeping at different \n&gt; places on the band. Pipe the audio through a mixer, and output it \n&gt; through amplified speakers or directly into the recorder. This way, \n&gt; you wil have audio bits throughout - even if you have to use 3 \nradios \n&gt; to do it.\n&gt; \n&gt; LC\n&gt; http://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Laura I am on the Yucatan peninsula.

It probably \n&gt; makes me feel a bit better if nothing is on the recording since I \n&gt; don&#39;t seem to pick anything up anyway. The &quot;Ask Bruce is a bit of \n&gt; surprise only because I already did ask bruce. He had suggested I \n&gt; try a direct recording. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This actually brings up a question about what Steve hears. Is \n&gt; it possible that you are getting a message given to you at the time \n&gt; you are listening to my recording which actually does not have the \n&gt; message? I must say I am still overwhelmed from getting messages on \n&gt; the other evp maker recording (that others hear). My pea brain and \n&gt; body are still processing that information. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Laui asked: I am in Campeche, Campeche, Mexico. City of, \n&gt; State of.

This may be a good opportunity to get \n&gt; help with my technical challange here in Mexico. I have posted what \n&gt; I recorded from AM signals along the beach here on the Gulf with \nthe \n&gt; recorder patched directly into the RS 12 469. Most channels are \n&gt; Spanish language although one or two channels skip across the Gulf \n&gt; fromTexas. So you shouldn&#39;t hear many English words from the radio \n&gt; if any.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am submitting this because, with the help of this group, I \n&gt; recently learned that I have been missing all the messages on my \n&gt; recordings. That is...I couldn&#39;t hear anything where others with \n&gt; experience hear plenty.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My previous post was with EVP make r. If somethng could be \n&gt; heard on the RS recording patched directly into my recorder that \n&gt; would be another amazing event for me. I of course hear nothing \nfrom \n&gt; the other side.
