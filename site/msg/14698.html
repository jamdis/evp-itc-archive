<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think the main problem with these &quot;BOX&quot; type recordings is that the words are jumbled together (and the voices don&#x27;t match)....we tend to try to listen for the loudest person to hear(as in natural conditions)At least that&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t understand near ALL of them.....Maybe if a person would slow down the recordings with there pc software, even if the voice sounds unatural(they do anyway) at least the seperations between the words will be enough to &quot;seperate&quot; that word. Someone should give it a try. They are loud enough to hear...just can&#x27;t seperate the syllables--- In EVP-ITC@...m, SnowfireL@... wrote:

&gt; Hey, If you guys can&#x27;t hear this now, I don&#x27;t know what to do with  you 
&gt; guys and gals, I made this louder so, you should be able to catch everything  
&gt; they are saying.  Love it!  It moves quickly, the 3 guys are saying,  &quot;Rat! 
&gt; Yepper, now two,  &quot;where&#x27;s the supper at? Parden  mouse, pregnant, yeah.   
&gt; What&#x27;s makes this so cool is I do have a  pregnant mouse, probably a few of 
&gt; them.  So, this for me is proof  positive!!!  Feel bad for anyone who can&#x27;t 
&gt; hear this, give me a call and I  will play it over the phone for you.  sf
