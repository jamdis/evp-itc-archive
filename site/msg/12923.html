  That could be a possibilty but also remember if you were an a-hole i=
n life it's not going to change because you pass over. I had a haunting in =
NH where this was very much the case.

  Also there are variables like enti=
ties from the lower planes that can come through when recording, vortex's t=
hat might allow opportunities to go from the other side to here, alien cont=
act or maybe simple interfences.

  I think sometis it maybe one who tries =
to intimidate us while recording. 

  I am also  Clairaudient  and here the=
 spirits that are stronger talk out loud.

  I do believe there is a mix of=
 good and evil of course in the spirit realm and some are pranksters. I oft=
en delete or not share the negative EVP'S unless it seems to be relevant to=
 the current work at hand.

  I have always beleived that perception can al=
so play into how we hear an EVP. 

  I have had the clearest EVP'S and have=
 had several people listen to them to only find out that almost every perso=
n heard it differently. Factors being computer, speakers, and your audio so=
ftware.


  Just some thoughts.

  Hope everyone ahs a nice Thanksgiving!

          I have=
 no real advice to add to this topic: but a thought that came to me while r=
eading your messages.

          What if there is 'crime' in the ethereal a=
s well as our physical world (from the good vs evil idea) ... and maybe an =
energy can possess or draw from another less powerful energy and 'change' i=
t?

          What do you think?

            If you are hearing=
 spirits, that's not EVP, but Clairaudience. Another thing to note is she m=
ay or may not have been talking to you at all. They talk amongst themselves=
 a lot more than to us. She was probably not even talking to you. I'm not s=
ure why people always assume energies are always talking to them or label t=

great error in my opinion. A really nice energy might sound like a stereoty=
pical Hollywood "demon". To stereotype energies, to me, is just silly.
