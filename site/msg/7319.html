Hi Frank,
 
Nothing in this life is perfect although we continuously strive for  
perfection.  Its the will to continue that makes us and defines  us.  You have 
continued your research where the others have left off  in the past.  And in doing so 
YOU have created a new science for  all of us to follow and research.  We may 
be small in numbers but  yet we are still considered a scientific community.  
And if it had not been  for you we would not be where we are at this point.  
Yes it is  not perfect but so far it is the best.  Maybe in the near future 
there will  be easier and better ways to get there but isn't that what you are 
trying to  accomplish?  So don't come down on yourself when it comes to the 
boxes  you are developing.  Because you are leading us towards the future  with 
your own research.  And for this we are all greatfull and look  towards the 
future with you.
 
Well this is just how I see it.  
 
Jeff

I know! There's  noisy crappy boxes out there, and I should have done this 
testing long ago,  but so many wanted to be like Chris Moon, and I wanted to get 
the boxes out  there so others could experience it, and experiment, but they 
function so  poorly as yet, and no one gets anything close to what I do, or 
what Moon  claims. So the TAPS article was correct about the things being 
flawed, but I'm  working on it. I don't sell the stuff, and never have, so all we've 
lost is  time. I can't make many of these, I can handle making them to test, 
and  improve the thing, but I dread just having to wire and wire and build and 
 build endlessly. I can't do that stuff anymore, just too brain fried.  

The fact is, there are other methods that work as well,  and probably better. 
Often the voices are much clearer with the simple  methods, and they can be 
shared since most can hear them. I am endlessly  discouraged when I think I 
have a perfectly clear voice from the box, and  not another person in the world 
can hear  it.
