I downloaded that file from Steve&#39;s website:\nwww.keyportparanormal.com. It&#39;s labled &quot;newest file&quot; in the EVP Maker test files sub-group. I ran it while simultaneously recording on my laptop and i think the outcome was magnificent. I&#39;m looking forward to more sessions and ultimately more results.\n\nRM\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Michael Ed &lt;f1cracker75@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Wow Rudy that was cool!
