He was \nnever \n&gt;   able to explain how his levitation of objects worked. The \nmilitary was \n&gt;   interested in his experiments...but could never dulicate the \neffects. \n&gt;   Not sure where he is with things, now, other than selling his \nvideos.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I can&#39;t believe you posted this, as I was just thinking of him \n&gt;   (especially his workshop and connecting it with Frank S for some \n&gt;   reason) in the last day or so.
