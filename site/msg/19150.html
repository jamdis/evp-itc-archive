<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, the sweep was stoppped on the low end of the AM band, so nothing but
static. I make Native American flutes, and the tones sounded similar, till I
noticed no melody, or patterns. It was curious though that if the radio
swept alitle, the tone were only  at the end of the band. Maybe it was pure
EVP with radio station involved? or not.

 There are some jacked up audio problms with this box that I have never
encountered before, such as the monitor amp drops dead at 3/4 volume and I
can find no reason for this, I changed all components and the IC socket,
even the volume control cable. To get sufficient volume I had to connect pin
one of the LM386 to ground through a .68 capacitor.  Never had to do
anything like that before.

&gt; I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a radio signal. It sounds like some sort of
&gt; resonance being set up in the echo chamber by something in the noise
&gt; from the radio. Sort of an audio oscillation.

&gt; &gt; Not sure what this flute sound is. The sweep hung up, and put AM
&gt; reception
&gt; &gt; down below the band--I think. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s a weird feedback signal,
&gt; as
&gt; &gt; it was only audible in the echo chamber. Could it be an amazing example
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; spirit communication, naw, I think it much more mundane. It was after I
&gt; put
&gt; &gt; the top cover on, so my vote is feedback notes.
