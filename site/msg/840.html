Cool Laura sounds like a good experiment. When will they be doing it? I am off for the week so me and Frank were talking about we should try a group experiment.
   
  I like that site. I check in now and then to see whats up in the photo department. Some of that research is similar to my own so it's nice to see people getting results.

          HI Guy, Welcome to the group! Your expertise will be valuable I am 
sure.
I am also a memeber of AAEVP and I have been researching EVP's and 
DVR for several years now. I have come along way in my research and 
Know of Dave and Frank and I believe they are serious and great 
contibutors to research in this area of communication. I am also a 
member on the experimentors team at ITCBRIDGE.com We are currently 
looking for serious people to help in creating a bridge among our 
group and to go to a frequency and record live the communications 
to set questions for a limited time frame. If you or anyone might be 
interested you may add me and Texas frank from ITC Bridge from yahoo 
to your list. We are wanting to set up a conference thru yahoo, and 
discuss the plan. Please let me state that we need harmony and 
people with a good set of ethics and morals to build this bridge for 
contact and are willing to conribute their time and their essence 
for higher levels of contact. Blessings All. Laura
