Just when you think you&#39;re getting great evidiecne and proo, it turns out to be these tricky jokers. Another reason not to take everything a gospel truth.  I think it was thoise researchers in Luxemberg(?) that first got these guys, but I don&#39;t remeber for sure. So if you hear any reference to fish, that&#39;s a clue that they are there. I am uncertain if they are bad guys, or just tricksters.  Frank-S"}
