  The unit now called Hertz was formerly called cycles per second, and is=
 the frequency of an electromagnetic signal. For instance, WLS radio in Chi=
cago operates on a frequency of 890 kilohertz.

  A Gauss is a unit of magn=
etic field strength. It is not a measure of electric or electromagnetic fie=
ld strength, only the magnetic component.

    Recently someone asked me the following question:

    [I am=
 brand new to the world of paranormal investigation. I believe I have a goo=
d grasp on what hertz and gauss measurments are, however am confused as to =
all of the differences between them. Hertz has more to do with the complete=
 cycles per second and gauss is the strength of an EMF. I guess where I am =
fuzzy is in my lack of physics. I thought frequency is also a measurment of=
 strength. I may not be making much sense here, but can you tell me where I=
 am missing somthing?]

    My answer was that I wasn't entirely sure mysel=
f but I think that Hertz measures the wave frequencies of the entire electr=
omagnetic spectrum. Gauss only measures the intensity or strength of EMF ge=
nerated around these wave frequencies. Depending on the range of hertz, an =
EMF is generated.

    I told him that I would check around with other peop=
le in the field to make sure.

    Was I correct?

    Thanks!
    April
