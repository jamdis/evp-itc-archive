I have used all\n&gt; &gt; kinds of stuff for the chamber, 12 inch X 4 foot long MDF board chamber,\n&gt; &gt; aluminum foil in a 1/4 inch wood frame, metal channels formed by gluing\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; metal strips. In box #1, I used a triangle shaped cany tin, and hte main\n&gt; &gt; board for the box was mounted on top.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The mic feed the fourth op amp channel of the sweep generator, where it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; amplified and forms the line out signal, and then drives the\n&gt; monitor/panel\n&gt; &gt; speaker. The electret mic has to be biased to work, if you buy one at RS\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; think the paskage shows the details. it gets a little complicated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Sun, Jun 20, 2010 at 6:49 AM, &lt;dc3644@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So how is the mic positioned?
