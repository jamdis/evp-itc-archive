I&#39;m trying to keep count, but that makes him a \nelectronics guru, UFO expert and demonologist!  Nice guy, but I think \nhe just has a great agent that can get him these &quot;roles.&quot;  \n\nAlso, I saw a lady have her home investigated by the Penn State bunch \non Paranormal State and supposedly in need of their help, then I turn \nthe channel and see her as a paranormal investigator on Ghost Hunters \nInternational!  She must have a great agent, too.  ;)\n\nLC  \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  At the risk of being negative yet again, all I can say is --You \nhave got to be friggin&#39; kidding!? No wonder all the &#39;serious \nresearchers&#39; call it entertainment, cuz shows like that put this work \nback with Barnum and Baily! I think they take urban myths, like the \nhaunted piano, and do a show on it, with all actors. Their \ndemonolgist supposedly worked on the Amityville case, ya mean the \nHollywood version, cuz the real case was nothin!?  Just watch the \npeople involved, and you can tell they are actors, with speech \ntraining, not a single um, ah, or stutter ever uttered! It&#39;s all just \ntoo well rehearshed and scripted for me to watch any more of it.   \nSome Googele results for &#39;haunted piano&#39;;  \nhttp://paranormal.about.com/library/blstory_august04_17.htm  &#39;YouTube \n- Haunted Piano Edited \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The classical version of the Haunted Piano is now renewed and \nbetter than ever!
