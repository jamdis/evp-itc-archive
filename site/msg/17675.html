<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

If voices are giving you full names (or really unusual given names) and you have a likely location for them (a location on planet Earth, that is), I&#x27;m willing to do a few quick checks to see if they have an actual history.

I probably won&#x27;t be able to find John Smith in New York City, without more information.

However, I did once locate the correct John &amp; Mary Murphy in 1880s Boston, Massachusetts.  (I found their burial records, though their graves were unmarked, and the burial info led to census records, etc.)

Anyway, if your voice has a fairly distinctive name (given name + surname) and a related location, let me know.  (The order of importances:  Full name, then location, and then -- way down the list -- the era/year.  I cannot work with just name + year; I must have a likely location.)

I&#x27;m happy to do some quick (and free) research, as time permits, to confirm whether (or not) those people actually exist in historical records.

I think it would be very cool to show that these names are real, and what they&#x27;re saying fits their histories in our world.  

(I&#x27;m qualifying that -- saying &quot;in our world&quot; -- because I think many voices and &quot;ghosts&quot; are actually alive and well, but in their own parallel/alternate worlds.)

Send serious inquiries to: fiona -at- hollowhill.com

Cheerfully,
Fiona</pre>
