I kinda loose track of \ndates/times when I stay up all night. This is the wood box with the \ncar tuner.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  BTW, so far these wood boxes are unique in that one is an AM/FM \ncar tuner, which(good ones) are hard to come by these days, and the \nother is a Radio Shack super hack, as I call it. So I don&#39;t want to \ngive up either one. 39 is the car tuner. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;   Make every e-mail and IM count.
