definitely a male voice). He should be told too!

&gt; If you ever get back over there Zack, encourage him to cross over into the
&gt; light, and/or send him a prayer if not though to get him to cross over into
&gt; the light, let him know he has loved ones there waiting for him.  By giving
&gt; us all this wonderful gift is probably, God&#x27; hoping we will all be like an
&gt; emissary to redirect these souls back to Him, sending  them all back to the
&gt; true spiritual home.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t know how you would &quot;test&quot; the entities. One of the best I&#x27;ve ever
&gt; goten though was at the former Manteno State Mental Hospital in Illinois.
&gt;
&gt; I was there with a group of about 8 people and the place was very active
&gt; that night. The building we were in is shaped like an &quot;H&quot;. We were in one
&gt; arm of the H looking across at the other and saw a shadow figure moving
&gt; around. We were just commenting on the figure when a voice came up in my
&gt; recording saying &quot;It&#x27;s Harold Wing.&quot;  It repeated this once and then said
&gt; &quot;It&#x27;s Harold.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Now, none of us heard any of this while we were standing there and none of
&gt; us knew or ever heard of Harold Wing. One of the people there later managed
&gt; to get into the old records for the hospital and found Harold Wing was a
&gt; patient there who died of typhoid fever there in 1938.

&gt;&gt; I am new to the group, I am a practicing Spiritualist but have never done
&gt;&gt; any EVP work. How reliable is the info you are getting, have any of you
&gt;&gt; tested the entities/voices? What are some of the best messages received?
&gt;&gt;
