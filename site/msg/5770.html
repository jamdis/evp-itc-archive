<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Ralph! I live midway between Frederick and Hagerstown, Maryland.  
I&#x27;m jonesing to take my minibox out into the field at Antietam other  
nearby sites this Spring. Perhaps we can get together, eh?

Nice to have someone in my area!

Cheers,

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m a new member of the group and I am an Investigator of the
&gt; Paranormal here in central PA. My group&#x27;s name is SPIRIT Paranormal
&gt; Investigation Team. I have been doing this in groups now for 6 years.
&gt; I had my own group H.I.P.S. (Harrisburg Independent Paranormal
&gt; Society) and now I am in the SPIRIT group out of Selinsgrove,PA. I
&gt; also use to be with Kelly Weaver&#x27;s group Capital Ghost Forum which is
&gt; now called Spirit Society of PA. I had to leave her group because of
&gt; my work schedule. I have been on Ghost Investigations with TAPS to
&gt; Waverly Hills Sanatorium,Ky, Eastern State Pennitentiary in PA. I
&gt; have
&gt; also investigated St. Augustine Lighthouse in Fla. I did have a
&gt; chance
&gt; to meet Bill Murphy here in Gettysburg,PA. on the Battlefield near
&gt; the
&gt; Wheatfield last year for a short time. He is a nice guy. I let him
&gt; listen to some of my EVP&#x27;s from the Wheatfield and Triangular Field
&gt; that day we met. I have been called an &quot; EVP Medium &quot; by my peers. I
&gt; have a ton of them. I would like to thank &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; for his
&gt; inspiring work with his boxes and giving of his time and knowledge to
&gt; inspire us to do our own research to find the answers we are all
&gt; looking for in this world. Thanks, Frank for your inspiration and
&gt; hard
&gt; work we all appreciate it. I would also like to thank &quot;Sum Duck&quot;
&gt; and &quot;Mike Coletta&quot; for coming up with those Hacks that made it easy
&gt; for me and all the others out there that are Electronically
&gt; illiterate.
&gt; Thank you guys we all appreciate it too. Oh well I just wanted to put
&gt; my two cents in to let you know I&#x27;m with you all. Oh, I have two 12-
&gt; 469&#x27;s the first one I broke trying to hack it LOL. The other one
&gt; works
&gt; great. I also have the 12-470(old model) which I tried to hack but I
&gt; cut the wrong wire. I cut the green wire (seventh wire from the top
&gt; as
&gt; Mike said to do)and when I put everything back together I had no AM
&gt; Band LOL. So I opened it up again and was thinking to myself should I
&gt; cut the wire before the green one I had cut or should I cut the wire
&gt; after the green one. Hmmmm, I thought here goes nothing so I cut the
&gt; yellow wire after the green one number eight from the top. I put it
&gt; together as I was crossing my fingers, I tried the FM band and bingo
&gt; it worked great. Just a funny story of how electronically illiterate
&gt; I
&gt; am. I do want to say I do hear alot of voices coming across these
&gt; boxes. I hear them saying their names and sometimes it sounds like
&gt; they are talking to each other. I have gotten answers to questions
&gt; too. Yesterday at my work place I like to listen to it while I&#x27;m
&gt; working here at the Post Office. I heard a male voice say to me &quot;Do
&gt; you want a Tech ?&quot; I also hear the name Lisa alot and they
&gt; say &quot;seven&quot;
&gt; alot too. My name has been called alot too. So there has to be
&gt; something to these boxes. Oh I also had one say &quot; Hurry dead battery &quot;
&gt; which my batteries did die a few minutes later which was cool. I was
&gt; recording with my voice recorder and picked that up. They say some
&gt; funny things sometimes too. I did hear one say to me &quot; F__k Off &quot; I
&gt; know that wasn&#x27;t on any radio program LOl. Oh well you have a great
&gt; set up here and it is nice to meet you all. Take care and keep up the
&gt; great work you all are doing in your researches. Bye for now !!
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
