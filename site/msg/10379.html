<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello guys, &amp; gals

I hope everybody is having a great day, its a beatiful day in the 
Bluegrass State of Kentucky.  I just had a death in my Family, and I 
was wandering if anybody does a session today/or tonight if you could 
try to get in contact with a Mr. Charlie Clarke,(my Great Uncle) or 
Mrs. Joann Clarke(his wife has past a couple of months ago)to see if 
you can contact them.  If you do contact him can you tell him that 
Rees will be asking to speak with them tonight around 7-8pm eastern 
time.  To see if they can contact me.  They lived a long and 
wonderful life together.  So all my family is sad to see him go, but 
we know it was his time to leave, and life goes on.  He should be 
happy to be back with his wife.  (He was 83 years old)  I know 
probaly somebody here might think this is crazy, dumb or 
disrespectful, but that is my business. I think it should be easy to 
get in contact with him since he just crossed over.  Please let me 
know if you tried and any evidence you might get from him.

Thanks

William Rees</pre>
