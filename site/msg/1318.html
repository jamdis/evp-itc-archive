  I am sorry that you have to experience that but it goes hand in hand with what we do. I agree totally with Frank Ratka on this. I learned along time ago that I am not doing this for recognition, fame, fortune, popularity, or to prove to anyone. Instead I approach it as I am the researcher, I am the student, I am learning. 
   
  I no longer waste my time talking to people who interfere or have a negative approach to the results we all get. I would much rather spend my few hours of free time talking to you guys or conducting more experiments.
   
  I know it can be hard to ignore negativity but if you do not ignore it then you yourself can become part of that negativity or be consumed by it entirely. So share, but do not react to negative feedback...enlighten but do not seek to impress.
   
  You are doing fine I see you uploaded a bunch of files I see some have personal details...is this proof for Y O U...thats what is important. Did they prove to you without a doubt that something extraordinary went on during that session. If the answer was yes then you know that you are on the right track. Dont let anyone pull you off that path or obstruct your moving forward.

          Bruce,

The best way to deal with the naysayers is to ignore them. We will
always have people saying such things and fighting with them only
negatively effects your own contact field. In the end you will not
convince them of anything.

In my case I answer what I think are legitimate questions from sincere
people. Some of those turn out to be the naysayers who want to argue,
I drop the conversation and move on. 

I look at it this way. If they have to ask how it works then they
don't know and feel enough to understand anything I would have to tell
them. They think it is a completely "technical" process, when the most
important components are the links between the two communicators.

As Misty and I have talked about in the past I was one who use to jump
at any opportunity to "fight the skeptics". I have since learned that
it is a pointless waste of energy and it does do damage to your
contact field or bridge if you have established one. The turmoil and
negative emotions controversy spawns are not conducive to the types of
communications we have been experimenting with.

Some of those skeptics genuinely want to learn what we know but just
can't grasp the basics needed to perpetuate this reality. Others just
want to get you worked up and off balance. By ignoring negative
contacts you are protecting your connection to your higher self. Don't
fall for their traps!

Best Regards,

Frank Ratka
