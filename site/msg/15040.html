        You are confusing th=

oscillation frequency of electromagnetic energy.  

        For example, we=
 can hear sound waves between around 40 Hz at the lower end to about 16,000=
 Hz at the higher end.  These are sound pressure waves.

        In the EM =

                                A mistake that a lot of =
people make is thinking that there are two different types of energy at wor=
k when it comes to sound waves and electromagnetic waves. The only thing th=
at seperates them is frequency and power. Radio waves are radio waves becau=
se they occupy a certain block of the electromagnietic spectrum. Sound wave=
s exist on that same spectrum just farther down with much longer waves. Sou=
ndwaves and subsonic waves can penetrate almost anything because of their w=
avelengths. The shorter the wavelength the more ways we can shield against =
them.

                                Think of microwaves. These are also =
a type of radio and telemetry transmitting wave but the waves also have a p=
hysical effect on our environment by causing molecules to speed up, which c=
reates heat. A little lower than this is IR or infrared it too can cause ph=
ysical objects to heat up but usually it just causes molecules to rotate in=
 place. All physical things give off IR light. Its a way the total system c=
onserves energy by spontaneously emitting IR radiation.

                               Here is some food for thought. I am currentl=
y reviewing my audio from our May 30th investigation.

                    =
            It was me and another girl teammate present in the room. I pick=
ed up a 3rd female voice on my digital voice recorder that I carry with me.=
 We were standing right next to another digital video recorder that I leave=
 beside my night vision camera. That recorder did not pick up this 3rd voic=
e. I have asked the girl that was with me to check her recording to see if =
she picked it up.

                                I have long felt the tru=
e EVP does not come from sound waves in the environment, or then it wouldn'=
t be EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow EVP's are appearing directly on =
the recordings.

                                This instance with the rec=
orders may back that theory up. That other recorder should have picked that=
 voice up if it were sound waves in the environment.

                     =
           I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. The file that is name=
d "01-02-17 Clip" is the full clip. You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah",=
 and then another comes in right after that. I think I know what it says.

=
                                Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but =
still did not hear this until playback. It isn't clear, so I am not as exci=

                       I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an un=
trasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It wo=
rks off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that diff=
er one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them together you g=
et a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is send=
ing a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating an un=
trasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate difference fr=
equency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was =
just an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic signals =
just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP were gener=
ated within a few inches of the recorder.

                                =
We are able to reproduce this affect in not only radio with superheterodyne=
 systems but also with acoustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a =
commercial produce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.
