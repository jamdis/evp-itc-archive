Where&#39;s the poloroid when you need it?!?  I bet the \nexpression on the woman&#39;s \n&gt; face was priceless when the RoboBox said &quot;Loves to cook.&quot;  :0)\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Well, I had a good time, did several talks, and--get this! An \ninvestigation. Or rather I \n&gt; kinda tagged along on a group&#39;s investigation and used one of the \nboxes. There was \n&gt; entities answering questions, and responding tot he group members. \nI gave the group the \n&gt; tape, so I won&#39;t be able able to play those. On my own recordings, \nthe spirits were pretty \n&gt; the same as  get at home, and even my son come through wiht &quot;My \nfather did this&quot;, which \n&gt; I played for a larger group. I loaned a box to another group, and \nthey also got entities to \n&gt; answer questions, and interact. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  RoboBox did perform for a group, with at least one meaningful \ncomment. A woman \n&gt; came to the table afte the talk, and asked &quot; Do they onokly talk \nfor you&quot;&quot;, and immediately \n&gt; RoboBox put out &quot;for you&quot;, followed after a few seconds &quot;Loves to \ncook&quot;, the woman was a \n&gt; cook!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  The whole thing is very energy intense. \n&gt; &gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; In a rush?
