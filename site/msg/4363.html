<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Tim,

Welcome to the group!

I&#x27;m sure you will soon be hearing (reading) opinions of others who do 
have both boxes. I only have the two models of the Radio Shack Hack, 
so I can not compare.
But to give you an idea about the two, even April Slaughter, who is 
involved with the Mini Box project, said in an earlier post here,

&quot;We spent time with all the different devices. The RadioShack Hack was
very surprising!!&quot;  ~ April Slaughter

Maybe some day I will be able to get a Mini Box, a Franks Box, and a 
Joe&#x27;s Box to compare... but until that day, I&#x27;ll keep plugging away 
with my Radio Shack Hack models, trying different configuations and 
sharing those with the group.

Please let us know which one you do get and how it works for you. 
It&#x27;s all about sharing and helping each other!

- Mike

&gt; I&#x27;m thinking about building the hack box Mike has,
&gt; But I hear some people say the mini box is better.
&gt; any body have both? can you tell me other than money
&gt; what would be best?
