I know there's somethig to the voices, but it's hard to prove something, or 
even demonstrate it if it's highly, highly, highly, highly, highly, 
highly---subjective, and personal?

Oh yeah, another first, I never got my son through the box, I had a voice I 
found last night "Frankie------I'm here", and at least it sounded real.
