Thanks Jim! IMO, that is the biggest problem that serious researchers of an=
y field  face-their own biases. It is good to be skeptical, but you HAVE to=
 keep open to any possibility, and realize that there can be holes in even =
your own, well thought out theories. Once you think you know it all and don=
't need to test further, you are lost.

I have several pairs of headphones,=
 but my best pair are Sennheiser eH 150's. I don't truly know a whole lot a=
bout headphones, I only know these came highly recommended and were moderat=
ely priced. I think I paid $50. They are very light and comfortable for ful=
l headphones. They have thick, padded ear cuffs and a padded headband. The =
others I have-the ear bud types, make my ears hurt. On investigations I use=
 them for live monitoring, so I wear them for long periods of time.

I woul=
d be willing to try the Numark one's, if your willing to let me :)

Can I e=
mail my address to you privately?

 In the "tomorrow let you know" EVP, I do hear something....just can't be s=
ure that it is a voice. I does have a cadence similar to someone speaking, =
but it could just as easily be something present in the environment-a natur=
al background noise. There is no way for me to tell for certain as it is ju=
st too feint. I can't make out any clear words. Sure-I could probably matri=
x some in, but that is all it would be. For an EVP to be considered proof p=
ositive of spirit communication by the community at large, it has to be cle=
ar enough that many people hear the same thing, without hints or coaxing. I=
f you have to have high quality devices to make it out, it just isn't good =
enough. That does not mean it isn't a true EVP, just that it isn't good eno=
ugh to stand as evidence. As for the whistle, it sounded like feedback to m=
e as well, but I will have to take you word for it that you were no where n=
ear any other electronics or EMF's that could contribute to feedback. Even =
so, if I am trying to remain unbiased and objective, there is no way for me=
 to say this is a spirit, without personally being with you when you caught=
 it. The only thing I can still say about it is could be, but for me it is =
non conclusive. If someone does not hear what you are hearing, try to remai=
n objective and just understand that it isn't personal. You have to underst=
and that with just these recordings alone, there is no way to scientificall=
y prove what you have recorded is spirit communication. If you could get co=
nsistent, intelligent question and answer recordings, then you would be alo=
t closer. Here again, we are back to the "So what?" thing. You don't HAVE t=
o prove anything scientifically, unless you want others to completely belie=
ve in your evidence. The theory that is being kicked around is that some EV=
P's are personal, and only meant for the person recording them to hear. If =
this is the case, no matter how clear something is to you, others may not h=
ear it. April ----- Original Message ----- From: James W. Hyslope To: EVP-I=

this is the case, no matter how clear something is

  be either mechanical (sound card or headphones=
)or maybe your hearing has loss 
  in those frequencies.<WBR>...Some of the=
se are not very clear or loud enough 
  too. But many will depend on your c=
omputer sound card & your headphones. I 
  have let an older man listen=
 (in his late 60's) and he has heard most all of 
  the audio. Same with a =
few guys at work. Some hear them right away, and others 
  can't until I lo=
op the actually EVP for a few tries. I personally use a Dell 
  Latitude D4=
30 to hear these. I can hear some on my cell phone. Headphones are 
  a mus=
t....or you won't hear anything either way. *But some can be heard on 
  ce=
ll phone without headphones. The conversion to MP3 has also caused some 
  =
loss, but I am still able to hear them when I review from this site (but I =

  have the repetive hearing syndrome in this area no doubt). Although I do=
 have 
  some disbelief (shock) that a few of these are not discernable. Go=
 back and 
  listen to "tomorrow let you know" is in a gruffy-robotic melod=
ic tone at the 
  very end but with higher natural volume. And if you could=
n't hear the 
  whistle...I would suggest the need to remove the cotton fro=
m the ear :) As for 
  feedback....<WBR>.feedback from what? I only had one=
 recorder working here. I 
  would rather hear someone say "I" made the whi=
stle....that would be more 
  understandable. And is very true....if someon=
e "tells" the group that THIS is 
  supposed to be what WAS said, then is v=
ery difficult to clear the mind to hear 
  it any other way. Kinda like try=
