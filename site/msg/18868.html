<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s actually not a book, it&#x27;s a Ph.D. thesis done under John Archibald
Wheeler at Princeton. It does not imply that there is no objective reality.
I guess you have to know a lot about physics to really understand what it&#x27;s
saying. And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a perfect theory, either. It has flaws, as
all of them seem to.

&gt; I never read that book, but if what it is implying is what I think it is...
&gt; that there is no objective reality... then that is very scary to me, and
&gt; hard to accept. A pill I can swallow if I must, but would rather not until I
&gt; have to... perhaps I should read that book :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been silent out of fear. Sometimes the ridicule gets hard to
&gt; take. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; know that sometimes mind does influence perception of reality. The
&gt; other day
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was brought back to quantum physics. They talk of an observer and how
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; &gt; the observer being there can change things. I was thinking it is like
&gt; when I
&gt; &gt; &gt; sing. I sing much better when I am alone than when I think someone can
&gt; hear
&gt; &gt; &gt; me.

I &#x27;s ac ually no a book, i &#x27;s a Ph.D. hesis done unde John A chibald Wheele a P ince on. I does no imply ha he e is no objec i e eali y. I guess you ha e o know a lo abou physics o eally unde s and wha i &#x27;s saying. And I don&#x27; hink i &#x27;s a pe ec heo y, ei he . I has laws, as all o hem seem o.
