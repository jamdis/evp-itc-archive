The \nshow is also posted up on my site at keyportparanormal.com for those to \nlisten to.  I put a link on my homepage to click and it will send you \nto my &quot;Radio Broadcast&quot; page and the show is the first one at the top.  \nAgain thanx mike for making me feel comfortable on there, i never do \nradio shows and that was the first one by myself.  Also thank you to \nthose who listened Live last night.\n\n-Steve H."}
