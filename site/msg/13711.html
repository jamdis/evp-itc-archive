        I think it is always ok to propose a the=
ory that some instance like this might be a real giant head, floating in th=
je sky.  But then, you have to ask stuff like, ok, are there better or easi=
er or more realistic explanations of what this could be?  In this case, sin=
ce we know clouds can form shapes that look like other things, and since we=
 know we can see shapes in clouds that aren't there, and since as far as we=
 know there are very few giant floating heads in the sky, then in this case=
, I agree, that the most intelligent course is to overide the giant head th=
eory and replace it with an "I'm experiencing pareidolia" theory.  And let =
that one hold, until some more compelling evidence proposes perhaps a diffe=
rent theory.
