I have a few suggestions that might be of interest.\n\n\n\n =\r\n First let&#39;s think about what it is you propose. You want to know if moveme=\r\nnt on a Ouija board is evidence of spirit communication or something else, =\r\npresumably your own abilities. In order to determine if a spirit is involve=\r\nd, you will need a test for a spirit communicator. This implies you know wh=\r\nat spirit communicators do. And therein lies the problem. We don&#39;t know thi=\r\ns unfortunately.  Now, we might frame the question differently: can we demo=\r\nnstrate if the acitivity is likely the result of motor response and if so h=\r\now? This won&#39;t make it possible to say that the results come from spirits, =\r\nbut it might be possible at least to rule out most known methods that are a=\r\nttributable to living persons, which would be a start.\n\n\n\n  We&#39;ll begin by =\r\nputting aside mechanical explanations. To do this we need to be sure ideomo=\r\ntor response cannot be a possibility. Since ideomotor requires opposing for=\r\nces in order to work, this means only one operator with a single finger of =\r\none hand on the planchette. \n\n  What we would really like to see is planche=\r\ntte motion with no contact. This would remove any normal physical explanati=\r\non of the planchette movement. Now we are down to one of two possibilities =\r\naside from kinetic energy, which can be disestablished by simply waiting. \n=\r\n\n\n\n  First, the planchette is being moved by some unknown psychic force by =\r\nan individual present in the room, perhaps the operator. Second, the planch=\r\nette is being moved by some unseen thing (which could include a &quot;spirit&quot;) t=\r\nhat may or may not be using a person in the room or elsewhere as an interme=\r\ndiary. We seek to establish which of these two is more probable. We do that=\r\n by seeing if there is any indication that a physical person in the room is=\r\n producing anything unexpected.\n\n\n\n  Here is where things become a bit dice=\r\ny and for some, problematic. There has been reputable research in the field=\r\n of Parapscyhology that indicates that there are focal people who participa=\r\nte in psychokinesis (PK), the apparent heart of what is called &#39;poltergeist=\r\n&#39; activity. There is every reason to believe that, if any anomalous planche=\r\ntte movement is occuring, that it too is most likely caused by PK. These fo=\r\ncal people have several characteristics, one of which is a history of psych=\r\nophysiological disorders. Unfortunately not everyone who has these disorder=\r\ns is aware of it. Many also have a belief system that in some way allows th=\r\nem to experience PK activity. Lastly they appear most often to be successfu=\r\nl in environments where strong magnetic fields exist.\n\n\n\n  This would sugge=\r\nst that the best way to detect a potentil living PK agent as the cause of t=\r\nhis activity would be to monitor two types of magnetic fields. In the envir=\r\nonment it would make sense to test for strong geomagnetic fields with porta=\r\nble geomagnetometers. These are not inexpensive; the type required cost abo=\r\nut $800 U.S. You can monitor body fields reasonably well using a Trifield N=\r\natural EM meter. Psychophysiologists have used these relatively inexpensive=\r\n meters to find high biofields in humans, often those who appear to be PK f=\r\nocal people. The key is that a DC meter must be used. Levels have been obse=\r\nrved in the 1 to 3 Gauss range. Yes, if you know much about human physiolog=\r\ny you will know that should be impossible. The physiologists who have relia=\r\nbly made these measurements are as stumped as anyone as to why they would b=\r\ne that high and cannot explain them either. They simply know that these are=\r\n replicable and stable readings over decades of measurements.\n\n\n\n  If you f=\r\nind this type of environment and you find a moving planchette with no one p=\r\nresent touching it, you can infer at least beyond a wild guess, that there =\r\nmay be some evidence for participation by a local individual as opposed to =\r\nan external entity. You cannot say with complete certainty that no external=\r\n entity is involved, but you can say there is a strong indication that some=\r\none locally is probably involved and likely responsible. To test this, remo=\r\nve individuals from the area and see if the activity stops. Clearly this sh=\r\nould be replicated if possible. While replication provides more certainty o=\r\nf the assumption it will never provide 100% proof, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n  I ho=\r\npe readers find this information useful. I monitor the digests occasionally=\r\n and will try to answer any inquiries you may have here.\n\n\n\n    JS\n\n\n\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_005C_01C9BB62.D7B6A470\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18702&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 =\r\nface=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;Hi John,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myria=\r\nd Pro&quot;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;I do app=\r\nreciate what you are saying here. \nBut I think it would be far easier to co=\r\nme at it&nbsp;from a different \ndirection-via testing&nbsp;the info receive=\r\nd for validity of spirit \ncommunication.
