I don&#39;t always &quot;hear&quot; sarcasm in text, at least until I&#39;ve been on a list longer and get a better idea of the more vocal personalities.\n\nI understand some of the &quot;hornet&#39;s nest&quot; issues, at least from a ghost hunting perspective.  I generally avoid the poltergeist/ghost issue, though I have opinions as admittedly shaky as everyone else&#39;s.  (For me, the poltergeist:water connection is most interesting.) All in all, I try to keep an open mind.\n\nThat said... the recording with the woman&#39;s voice saying things including &quot;Contact his box&quot;... that&#39;s on the level?  If so, that&#39;s startling.  I heard some unexpected and clear voices on the box Chris Moon was using, but if that&#39;s real, this throws another large wrench/spanner in my mental works.  \n\nI love it when compelling new (at least, new to me) data kicks my smug assumptions, hard.\n\nOf course, if that wasn&#39;t posted as a real recording, I&#39;m going back to lurk mode now, blushing scarlet.\n\nCheerfully,\nFiona"}
