<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Interesting, maybe young minds in tune to something. I used to get &quot;Captain Marshal&quot; of the Alpha ship, mostly on EVPmaker. Until October of 2006, a guy calls into C2C, tells George Norry how he had an ET encounter through his TV, which was turned off, they told him how he was really a Captain on one of the ships, supposedly we all have these dual, or multiple lives, anyway he was Captain of he Alpha ship and his name ----- Marshal! I have not heard his name mentioned since, through the boxes or EVPmaker. Curious that, and it&#x27;s these mind numbing convaluted connections in the paranormal of which we are only very vaguely aware. Just the synchronisity to hear this particualr show is mind boggling.
