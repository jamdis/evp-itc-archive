&gt; Yeah Frank knows he left a few details out, he mentioned that a  
&gt; while back its why he keeps updating schematics. The ST method is  
&gt; something him and Dave termed, and I just took the idea, ran with  
&gt; it and put it to the test...still testing. So far it works as well  
&gt; for me as any other method tho its sound frequencies can be heard  
&gt; easily by more people.
&gt;
&gt; Congrats to you both on your upcoming engagements I wish it wasnt  
&gt; on the other side of the states i&#x27;d drop in. I am not much of a  
&gt; &quot;speaker&quot; but I try and get my typing in as much as I can hehehe.  
&gt; Im a big goof when ya stick me in front of a room of people.
&gt;
&gt; You should give it a try I think you may be surprised. But again, I  
&gt; am getting great results with all methods as far as my own hearing  
&gt; goes...but I do see others can hear these easier for the most part.  
&gt; It has to do with the frequency levels it hits. Spirit says 5 to 1  
&gt; people do not have perfect hearing and that is why we all hear so  
&gt; differently and why some agree while others cant hear a thing but  
&gt; static. Think of it as a dog vs human scenario...dog whistles hit  
&gt; that frequency many people cant hear...I hear them but for some its  
&gt; silence....for the dog its very loud and clear. I think they match  
&gt; each recording mediums vibrations and in effect tune into speaking  
&gt; in a way so you can hear them...even if you are the only one that  
&gt; can hear them.
&gt;
&gt; Very interesting about the stone circles, I was just thinking of  
&gt; this not too long ago and also researching &quot;singing&quot; stones after I  
&gt; saw a headline about them on the news. They do exist. Some also  
&gt; have electromagnetic functions which come into play. I love rocks,  
&gt; always have, and I have collected them since I was small long  
&gt; before I knew as much as I know now. They also play a big part in  
&gt; some of my ITC images that have come thru. They still shock me with  
&gt; the clarity sometimes.
&gt;
&gt; It is all very very humbling for me. I am nobody special, not  
&gt; someone who wants to be famous, nor one who would have ever thought  
&gt; I would/could be involved doing research on something such as this  
&gt; for so long and remain so dedicated (or is that addicted LOL) but  
&gt; one small voice sent me on a sharp turn and now I am on this path.
&gt;
&gt; Paranormal has always been just normal...now moreso than ever. I  
&gt; think perhaps they have always been watching me and they are the  
&gt; voices that kept me awake at night, the invisible person sitting on  
&gt; my bedside so I couldnt fall asleep and would scream for my mama to  
&gt; come stay with me until I fell asleep. I could probably name 1000  
&gt; things that I have witnessed and others have witnessed over my  
&gt; lifetime but too tired to start that list tonight LOL
&gt; I never realized how closed my eyes were until they opened wider. I  
&gt; always knew what was there I just never realized it in detail.

&gt; Thanks, Bill! (Pssst...check is in the mail...he he)
&gt;
&gt; I want to make it clear that I was NOT criticizing Frank about his
&gt; box or the document! It&#x27;s just that I read it over thoroughly
&gt; yesterday and found some things that were missing or unreadable.
&gt; Otherwise - it&#x27;s the only &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; for details on Frank&#x27;s
&gt; box. The setup is not rocket science...anyone versed in electronics
&gt; could build one and even improve on the design (I have several
&gt; thoughts on that).
&gt;
&gt; I haven&#x27;t had a chance to check out Misty&#x27;s &quot;sweep tuning&quot; method
&gt; but just that name seems to indicate something close to the &quot;manual&quot;
&gt; way of creating Frank&#x27;s box as I previously mentioned (i.e. randomly
&gt; pushing radio buttons).
&gt;
&gt; Lastly - as Bill said - he and I will be presenters at the
&gt; conference in July. My particular presentation (which I&#x27;m still
&gt; piecing together) will be on Paranormal Sound Phenomena. Rather than
&gt; rehash techniques for recording/analyzing EVP - I plan on going into
&gt; more depth on present/past research in paranormal sounds (such as
&gt; playing the first spirit voices ever recorded, ultrasonic pulses
&gt; detected at stone circles, etc.) and make a plea to participants to
&gt; stretch beyond present emphasis on just recording said sounds but
&gt; get into broader research projects. I&#x27;m not one to &quot;toot my own
&gt; horn&quot; but I&#x27;m also slated to appear on the June 3 show of Ghostly
&gt; Talk (http://www.ghostlytalk.com) to go into more depth on the
&gt; famous (or infamous) Spiricom Mark IV story.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To expand upon Guy&#x27;s post, the echo chamber size can vary. Some of
&gt; his
&gt; &gt; boxes have an internal chamber that&#x27;s about 2&quot; x 3.5&quot;. Some of his
&gt; &gt; boxes have chambers which are external and are a bit larger. An
&gt; &gt; external one I saw was made with a light wood frame which was
&gt; wrapped
&gt; &gt; in heavy aluminum foil.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If someone is considering constructing their own FB then I suggest
&gt; &gt; considering the sweep tuning method also as the recordings I&#x27;ve
&gt; heard
&gt; &gt; are impressive. We are experimenting with a RVG equipped box and
&gt; are
&gt; &gt; getting good results but I am also interested in the sweep tuning
&gt; &gt; approach.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; By the way, Guy and myself both be speaking at the upcoming South
&gt; &gt; Coast Paranormal Convention July 20 and 21 in Santa Paula, CA. see
