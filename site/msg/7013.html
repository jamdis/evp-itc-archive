&gt; Ann,
&gt;  
&gt; Frank&#x27;s box is a lot different to listen too than any other
&gt; box, it has it&#x27;s own tone and resonance. So consiquently 
&gt; the files will sound different, and I think many of Frank&#x27;s 
&gt; box files get better as the box is used more by the reasearcher
&gt; and has time to be imprinted by the spirit technitions.
&gt;  
&gt; So the communication with a Frank&#x27;s box is like wine, it gets
&gt; better with age. This particular box is performing excellently
&gt; on the first session, it holds special promise of possibly being
&gt; the best box Frank has ever produced.
&gt;  
&gt; More files to come!
