There is plenty of other stuff coming through as well,\n&gt; what do I care if people don&#39;t believe this, I do because, I know this is\n&gt; meant to be, and I am sure of it it&#39;s going to be something for other&#39;s like\n&gt; seeing is believing and there is nothing we can do for them, it&#39;s like the\n&gt; Wright Brother&#39;s flying for the first time here people, they said how in the\n&gt; world will that big heavy thing get off the ground?  I say lets go for it, a\n&gt; machine will be found to make them come in loud and clear one day.  sf*\n&gt;\n&gt;  In a message dated 5/18/2009 9:13:25 A.M.

I do clean\n&gt; up evps if I hear something and can&#39;t make it out do to ambient noise.  So\n&gt; hear is my question.  When do you stop cleaning up?  Wouldn&#39;t to much\n&gt; enhancing &quot;taint&quot; the results?  To me the more enhancing you do the less\n&gt; convincing it becomes.  I hope no one finds this offensive, it is not meant\n&gt; to be I am just really curious.  The way I look at it is that if you have to\n&gt; do so much enhancing to find anything, was there really something there to\n&gt; begin with.  Are we just making ourselves believe there is something there??\n&gt;\n&gt; Eric\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------\n&gt; *A Good Credit Score is 700 or Above.
