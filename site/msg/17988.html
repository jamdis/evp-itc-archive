will you be selling one again?  Please let me know I'd like to bu=

My guess is there is something wrong with your radio. Those things shoul=

not be stopping you from receiving FM and AM transmissions.

re radio waves necessary?


 
 
 
 

My take on it is that the spirits or w=
hatever they are are capable  of 
using whatever methods are placed in fron=
t of them. DVR's get EVP. I've  gotten 
EVP on the sound tracks of a video =
recorder. The radio and ITC seems  to 
generate a different class of commun=
ication. EVP-Maker is another  one.
 
Probably the method of actually produ=
cing the sound waves is  different for 
each device.

The only remaining question then, aside f=

it may be that radio waves are on=

Bottom line, with so many opti=

any
reasonable hypothesis.
