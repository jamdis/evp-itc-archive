<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That makes sense Bruce.  I&#x27;ve noticed after a couple of longer
sessions, I felt somewhat drained energy wise.  That could be a result
of the exchange of spiritual energy.  Thanks for the input.

&gt;  
&gt; I believe the heightened intuitive senses you and other researchers
are experiencing
&gt; comes from the link that is forged between us and our tech/guides
and other spirits
&gt; due to the open and active line of live communication that we create
during an open box session.
&gt;  
&gt; I believe that some of our spiritual energy is absorbed by our
spirit contact and some of their energy absorbed by us.
&gt;  
&gt; creating a link that generally heightens our sensitivity spiritually.

&gt; 
&gt; I have a question for those of you who have been doing this
researchfor a while. Since doing the research, have you noticed an
increasein your &quot;intuitive&quot; senses? By that I mean, has your hearing
beenheightened to the point of hearing conversations when you are
alone? Or seeing things more clearly spirit wise? Or am I just nuts
and needto be committed? I had to ask. It&#x27;s a very strange thing.
These things have beenhappening to me and I&#x27;m wondering if you have
experienced the samething or close to it.Jeremy
