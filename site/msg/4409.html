<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I get a mix of stuff that seem like coded dates, I think it points 
to 2012. I hate to ask quaestions, cuz then I think you expect an 
answer and either create it, or read more into the voices than there 
is. I count on my guys to give me what I need.

&gt; That is an amazing message there Frank...seems to fit with what 
many have been saying...including remote viewers like Ed and 
company.  Can you get dates or more info?  Or do you want to?   Ron L

&gt;  Here I use audio from an old school board meeting for the raw. 
It&#x27;s speech only.
