(Yes, it&#39;s another of my many hats.)  For years, I&#39;ve been the behind-the-scenes go-to person for professional genealogists to reach a dead end... no pun intended.\n\nSo, if I can help you located the 150-year-old record, let me know. I&#39;d be happy to see what I can, um, dig up.  \n\nIf I can contribute that kind of research to this work, I&#39;m delighted!\n\nCheerfully,\nFiona\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s all fascinating. It makes sense to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have gotten several EVP recordings in which a name was given. In all cases\n&gt; the name is not a name that was known by any of the living people present\n&gt; and there is no particular reason for anyone there to be thinking of that\n&gt; name. In one case the name was verified in old records as a person present\n&gt; in that location many years ago (but we certainly didn&#39;t know that at the\n&gt; time we were there). In another case we&#39;re still trying to find out if\n&gt; anyone by that name was in that area within the last 150 years.\n&gt; Zack\n&gt;"}
