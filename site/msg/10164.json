I took 5 files\n&gt; and played them in a sequence and recorded it, it consists of tone\n&gt; frequencies ranging from 100hz, 250hz, 440hz, 1khz and 10khz.  They\n&gt; were 5 second clips of each and than i ran it through EvpMaker and it\n&gt; sounds like morse code, but i have to brush up on it to see if it makes\n&gt; any sense.  Is it possible for them to communicate through morse code?\n&gt; I&#39;ve attached a 30 second clip of the example running it through\n&gt; EvpMaker.  I&#39;ll also attach my original tone file i created.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
