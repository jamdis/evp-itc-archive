  Hi LC, 
From what I could tell: they were using a 12-470 radio shack hack and
calling it a Franks Box. they seem to be out of California from what I
could gather not positive tho. But, they did use the itc video looping
method live as well as with the session on the radio.
Thats all I could gather.
They seem to have archived footage as well at the site after you
register. 
I hope that helps. Let me know what the files give I sent ya.
TC and thanks for being kind.
