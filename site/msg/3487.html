 I did, from the begining open this to anyone, and I am not amused that on=
e person would take the technogoly, claim it as his own, and attempt to mak=
e it exclusive to himself. For one person to say he is the "primary tester"=
 is inaccurate, he was the first that kinda understood how it was supposed =
to be used, or so I thought. I think we left the "treting phase" some time =
ago, perhaps it's time to return barrowed equipment?
 
 I wasn't quite fini=
shed with that e-mail-- I hit the send button in my rush to get off to work=
. 
 
 
 
 I put out a box use guideline thing a year or two ago stating tha=
t no one has the right to take my equipment and and claim their use superce=
des anyones else's use, or results.
 
So, to contiue...
 
 As a far as "tec=
hnicians" I don't get any of that stuff, but---they do talk about a network=
, and connection to our equipment. When I first made my "Ghostman" box, las=
t week, it wasn't working well, but a day or so later, it came to life, and=
 one of the voices said it had been connected to "the network". Supposedly =
there is a similar connection made to computers running EVPmaker. I'm not s=
ure if these "network" connections are maintained if equipment is taken out=
 for investigations, or demostrations. Of cousre, I can't say if these netw=
orks are a fact. I would think as maker of the box, these etheric techs mig=
ht want to give me, or others some hints.
 
 As far as the ghost box, or Fr=
ank's box, being a "telephone to the dead", I think is very poor analogy, t=
he old style phone system of Edison's day had operators, plural, not one pe=
rson that recieved all calls, then interpreted what was being said to other=
 parties. That's more of a master control schema.The old phone system didn'=
t charge you an arm and a leg to talk to someone in the same room either! S=
ome might say these "Technicains" are the operators, but even if anyone esl=
e could hear these voices, why do you need someone to interpret what's bein=
g said. I say if not many can hear it, or something similar, it ain't real!=
 There is a certain kind of conatct, ion that that your own mind uses the n=
oise as a sort of psychic prop, you hear the stuff in your head, it may be =
accurate and real inforamntiion, but no one else is going to hear it. i thi=
nk that what all this supposed converstions wiht Edison maybe.  I have in f=
act heard a voice that said "Edison here" but there was no other real infor=
mation conveyed that I could understand. 
 As for portals, demons and evil =
spirits entering the world through these "unauthorized" boxes, I an only sa=
y, as the original mker of the box, I have gotten voices cuzzing, swearing,=
 name calling, and even threatening, but nothing that has seemingly "entere=
d" our world. Even those "threatening entities", when pressed to bring it, =
fold up like paper tigers. These beings and spirits already exist all aroun=
d us, and at a higher level, so they have full access to this, a lower leve=
r. Besides. There is that "network" that seem to allow for better contacts,=
 and kinda helps highter being to come through. 
 
 I made these "boxes"! T=
he idea was not "Edisons Telephone..." What I got was an assemblage of my o=
wn expereince and knowlegde, put together by my own mind as answer to my qu=
estion of what else could I use for spirit comuncation. All technology invo=
lved was based on what I had worked on in the past for radio experimentatio=
n. I had in fact, a couple years before my interest in EVP, been experiment=
ing with voltage tunable radio modules removed from car stereos for AM DX, =
that's listening to distant AM radio stations. I was hoping to find other t=
alk shows similar to Art Bell, and there used to be one out of Cincinati(?)=
. The idea of using a random voltage to tune the radio was after using EVPm=
aker, which uses a method of generating random speech bits for the entities=
 to use. It was a small leap to apply the random technique to an anolog sys=
tem. I am not the first to be focusing on a problem, and have the mind prov=
ide an solution in complete form. Nothing mystical about it. The fact is, a=
fter much work, and experimenting, the tuning doesn't have to be random, a =
linear tuning works much better. Yet another fact of  the box, covienently =
ignored.
 
 What really chaps my hide, as maker of the box, is to have some=
one, who knows nothing of electronics, and technology completely ignore eve=
rything I say about the box, and presume to tell me how it really works, ho=
w it should be used, and what is acceptable from it. This guy is so honest,=
 he won't even use his real name, but huff and puff at at anyone that contr=
adicts his use of my equipment. I say, as "a Tester" if you can't use it in=
 an honest manor, bring the stuff back--testing over! Like it or not, the p=
ublic has this technology, you can keep pissing and moaning, trying to spre=
ad fear, or you could choose the way of Light.
