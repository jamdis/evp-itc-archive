I saw the same ones, at Longs Drug store but for about $10 or so! I found, yesterday, for $1. at a thrift store, &quot;Hi-Fi Mini-Speakers for Sterio receiver & cassette by Tectron&quot; Model HT-12    www.tectronint.com which I found helps a tiny bit to increase the volume rather than the other ones I&#39;ve been using. Seems both need to have the RS Hack 469 turned to MAX volume though!!  =Judy=                                                         --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; hey guy&#39;s these speakers are about three inches long. they are not very \n&gt; powerfull but get the job done, they take 2 aaa batteries to run and \n&gt; plug right into the top of th RS 12-469. I bought them at a burlington \n&gt; coat factory for 4.99\n&gt; \n&gt; I will try to find them on line and post the url.\n&gt; there is a pic in the photo section in the Bruce folder.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;"}
