I have one EVP that occurred right \nafter someone asked &quot;Are you happy?&quot; and during the time a car passed by \noutside the building it was recorded in. When we were in the building all \nwe heard was the motor sound. On the recording, the motor sound plainly \nbecomes the words &quot;Course I&#39;m haapee.&quot;\n\nZack\n\nOn Tue, 3 Jun 2008, threadsintyme@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Heather,\n&gt; Please explain a bit more...this is really interesting to me...\n&gt; Al\n&gt;\n&gt; -- &quot;HKaczmarek&quot; &lt;hkaczmarek@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am new here but I have had excellent success with using running water in the background.

Could it be that the AM band has some sort\n&gt; of &quot;special properties&quot; that would allow such communication?\n&gt;&gt; Why is it that the AM band has to be used with a radio station\n&gt; playing? There are parts of the spectrum that is just outside of that\n&gt; spectrum that might provide a better form of communication.\n&gt;&gt; Al\n&gt;&gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt;&gt; Click here for great computer networking solutions!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; http://thirdpartyoffers.juno.com/TGL2131/fc/Ioyw6iighEHwMAbLKMUuYo359E\n&gt; 28alDzNnXaMa5yrqURXjmUoY4EK4/\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________\n&gt; Click here for financial aid options.
