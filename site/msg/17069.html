<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>&quot;Also, I don&#x27;t get why anyone who is a skeptic would belong to this group?&quot;

I am here because I want to see what its all about, ask questions, and form
my own conclusions. I can&#x27;t have an opinion on something if I don&#x27;t even
know what it is about. So I am here to learn about ITC technologies from
both believers and other skeptics alike.

I am not here to debunk or otherwise tear apart anything Frank is doing, and
my opinion should not matter to him.

I am here to hopefully find proof one way or another.

Some people here have very bad baggage associated with skeptics. A true
skeptic neither believes, nor disbelieves anything without proof either way.
There are people who won&#x27;t believe anything no matter what proof you give
them. They are not true skeptics. They are disbelievers, the flip side of
believers.

Skeptics should be square in the middle. Skeptics think only objectively.

&gt; JANDANACOSTA,
&gt;
&gt; Being skeptical about something - doubting something is certain - seems
&gt; like a reasonable attitude with all the things we encounter in life
&gt; (politics, tv, religion, car salesmen, diets, advertisements, etc).
&gt;
&gt; So to answer your question &quot;Also, I don&#x27;t get why anyone who is a skeptic
&gt; would belong to this group?&quot;.  Doubting and questioning results can only
&gt; make a field of research more  solid in the long run.  It helps to divide
&gt; the weak evidence and methods from the strong.   While everyone is still
&gt; free to pursue their beliefs, everyone only has so much time and money,  and
&gt; getting help with determining the best areas to spend that time and money
&gt; can be a valuable thing.
&gt;
&gt; So for anyone doing research, especially their own personal research, who
&gt; is not wealthy and does not have 100 years left in their lives, being
&gt; skeptical about one&#x27;s results seems not only a necessity, but I don&#x27;t think
&gt; any kind of progress, especially in a difficult area like the paranormal, is
&gt; even possible without it.

&gt; You are ever bit as bad as Randi or any of them!  You are just the
&gt; flip-side of the coin!
&gt;
&gt; Your misuse of the word, &quot;Skeptic&quot; has taken on a totally new meaning.  You
&gt; see anyone that has a problem with your half baked ideas, and insanity, yeah
&gt; I said it, as a &quot;Skeptic.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Maybe it would do you some good to research the word and idea behind it
&gt; before you go off half cocked as you are.  The world is not out to get you
&gt; or your damned box!  If there is any truth to it, the let&#x27;s see the evidence
&gt; of it.  Lets look at it for what it is, NOT WHAT YOU OR ANYONE WANTS IT TO
&gt; BE!
&gt;
&gt; What it is, no more and no less!
&gt;
&gt; I am a Skeptic, it the true sense of the word.  And I have been holding my
&gt; tongue hoping you would pull out of this crap.  Frank, get a grip!
&gt;
&gt; Not everyone that disagrees with you is out to get you!  I have real
&gt; problems with the whole theory, but I have never questioned your heart
&gt; or integrity over it.  (Well, other than letting Moon play the dance he is
&gt; playing with YOUR BOX!)
&gt;
&gt; But, lets analytically look at this for what it is and find the truth of
&gt; it?  If you want to turn it into a religion that is on top of some mountain,
&gt; so be it!  But other people are not going to see the subject in black and
&gt; white standards.
&gt;
&gt; Give it a rest and thinks about it.  The world is not out to get you Frank!

&gt;  I know what it is, even though I can&#x27;t even spell it or pronounce it. It&#x27;s
&gt; what the skeptics and debunkers tout as the answer to all paranormal
&gt; experience. I think we ought to pull our claws back in, especially me!
&gt;
&gt;  I have gotten &quot;voices&quot; that I thought were perfectly clear, and no one
&gt; else could hear it, and some I found was just a snippet of music, so yeah,
&gt; that happens, but it does not eliminate or explain everything from the
&gt; boxes, and other EVP methods, you  just have to be aware of the possibility.
&gt; Anotherr problem is broadcast fragments, sometimes they are just what they
&gt; sound like, an ad for one thing or another, sometimes they can have
&gt; sychronistic meaning, and sometimes they can be altered in some way to form
&gt; a messages, such as the recent one I had about learning sex, which was
&gt; seemingly ignored by all cuz it has the &quot;s&quot; word--I guess. The fragments can
&gt; also be distorted as the radio tuning is swept across a station, I don&#x27;t
&gt; accept every word and syllable as meaning something. You have tio judge
&gt; mnessage by content and personal meaning.
&gt;
&gt;  I have seen faces stand up in a carpet right in front of me, not something
&gt; I just happened across, something that happened live as I watched. For
&gt; someone to suggest that&#x27;s imagination I find very offensive.
&gt;
&gt;  When I first switched to a linear sweep in the boxes, I could hear nothing
&gt; but gibberish, then suddenly I could hear &quot;them&quot; speaking. I doubt that is
&gt; all imagination either, I think the mind(which is not brain) has to
&gt; reprogram the ears, which are brain, to hear.  I also think the skeptics can
&gt; not allow this programming to take place, hence they can&#x27;t hear. I would be
&gt; very surprised if any of the hard core skeptics even turned on a box for
&gt; fear that they may hear something that&#x27;s not there. Rorke(the Phd) implied
&gt; as much when he wanted a box to test, or more like debunk. That crap is
&gt; frikkin&#x27; pathetic!

&gt;&gt;&gt;  It was implied that all this stuff is &quot;Pareidolia&quot; , and because you
&gt;&gt;&gt; could put a name on it that somehow meant it was all explanined. I&#x27;ve been
&gt;&gt;&gt; hearing this pseudo scientific BS for 10 years, so I&#x27;m a bit touchy. Science
&gt;&gt;&gt; explains the paranormal away, and yet people continune to photograph images,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and get their names, and the names of deseased loved ones through EVP, as
&gt;&gt;&gt; well as questions answered, and science(althogh not all scientists) just
&gt;&gt;&gt; ignores these inconvinient facts and focuses on that we might see things
&gt;&gt;&gt; that are not there, which I disagree with as well.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  Did you even bother looking at the image on the group home page. That
&gt;&gt;&gt; was from sweeping a TV tuner with a random voltage and video recording the
&gt;&gt;&gt; monitor screen. So explain away why there is a wolf image embedded in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; guy&#x27;s hat, an image of an alien below his ear, and why in God&#x27;s name does he
&gt;&gt;&gt; resembles the classic description of an MIB or Shadow Person?  Pareidolia no

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree trying new things is good.  And discussing results.  And looking
