Happy New Year! \n   \n  All methods are welcome here. I dont post my stuff so much for feedback as just to share what the messages are. If I want feedback I email private to someone. No matter what method is used, people will hear thier own way. Sometimes they hear what I hear sometimes they hear a totally different message for themselves, sometimes they just hear blahbedeblah/nothin .\n   \n  Watch out for that negative energy thats building =) it will only get in the way of the research. If one method isnt your cup of tea, try another. There are so many choices that I am always adding something new to the list of things I tried that had results, whether good or cruddy it all gets documented and I move on.\n   \n  Yeah people have been really busy. I think we have a case of active member syndrome. Either they are actively focused on another topic of discussion (hopefully not a war of words) or they are like me and just too dang busy working to have much free time to remark on all the files we listen to. If you ever &quot;need&quot; feedback just holler...you know my email and private emails usually get priority response whether Im busy or not. \n   \n  Misty\n  \n\nSteve Hultay &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hey, Misty at least people are responding to your audio files.
