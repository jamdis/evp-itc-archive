<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>F- As you may have noticed I suggested a haunting is something 
powered by the living, and that&#x27;s one reason why I showed that 
segment of the Louisiana DVD. Yeah it was quite an evening at the 
Stanley. It was like the history of Frank&#x27;s Box with v15 through v25 
along with the MiniBox all in the same place. 

Regarding the Mini, even though it looked pro built in person it&#x27;s 
all about the communication recieved through a Box that is most 
important. I didn&#x27;t get to spend a lot of time with it or hear a 
message from it while I was there but it&#x27;s interesting that April 
mentioned the Mini had called her name already and yours. That 
tendency to identify people seems consistant with all of them so 
maybe the Mini will work out fine. The ones Steve H. builds also seem 
to work ok. -B

&gt; Thanks! I had a good time as well. Still don&#x27;t believe in hauntings 
though. I got home about 4am.
