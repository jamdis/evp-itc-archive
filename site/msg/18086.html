      Experiment 2



On Friday, 7/16/2010 I placed an object on top of m=
y computer monitor, right in front of me, and will leave it there until noo=
n Denver time on Monday, 7/19/2010.   This experiment asks for participants=
 to determine what that object is. Vague or partial answers won't be counte=
d (for example, just giving a color, shape, size,  what it's made of, etc):=
 we're looking for what it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Monday won=
't count.  Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any ot=
her means they chose.  At the end of the experiment, I will reveal the obje=
ct, and a tally of the number of correct and/or incorrect answers.





In =
order to keep me honest, I have taken a picture of the object at the start =
of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this gr=
oup.  The idea with this file is that you can download it now and 'keep it =
safe' on your computer. Then at the end of the experiment, I will post the =
password so you can reveal the contents of the file. That way, you were in =
control of the original image during the entire test, not me. If you can fo=
llow the link, it is here:

Mac users: http://tech. =
groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ20100716. mac.zip



And if yo=
u do not care to download the zip file now, I will post the final image the=
re at the end of the experiment anyway.



My monitor is one of the older b=
ox-like SONY CRTs, and says "Trinitron" and  "Multiscan 200sf" on the upper=
 front.   I have a couple monitors stacked in my closet too: they are not t=
he monitors used in this experiment (and have nothing else on them anyway),=
 and I have several laptops around: they are also not the monitors in this =
experiment.  The monitor in this experiment is the only SONY monitor I have=

m the first experiment, when the correct answer would have been "radio":
