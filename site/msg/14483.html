My point was that they don't need to know how it works for it to work, like=
 my analogy of when I speak into a microphone. I don't know how that works,=

I don't know how it works. But here again, I don't have to know and i=
t still works. I don't even know how exactly an analog recorder works eithe=
r. I have no clue how my voice can be transferred and recorded via electron=

But I see what=
 you are saying and this does make sense:

"It is much more credible for th=
e signal to be manipulated near the AtoD converter (where EMF changes would=
 have the most straighforward result) than in the digital media itself."

I=
 never meant to insinuate exactly how it could or couldn't work, only that =
true EVP is not created via sound waves in the environment. It has to be el=
ectromagnetically generated. From this statement is seems that's entirely v=

EVP has been found on analog recordings. Would this also hold t=
