<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Rosemary!

;-)

BTW, have you had time to do any other communication sessions with 
your new MiniBox? 

Elaborating on the voice quality improvements with the MiniBox, and 
other positive results of your own, should be a big help to others 
deciding whether or not to grab one for their own experimentation. 

Since I personally know Ron, his thoughts, workmanship, ect... I&#x27;ve 
been sold on any concept of ITC equipment he might create since 
carrying own discussions for years running. Rick Moran deserves a big 
thanks for somehow coaxing him into finally building something that 
works! 

LOL!

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the clarification, Rosemary and April.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I just got great news! Ron&#x27;s personally going to be bringing to 
my 
&gt; &gt; new Mini to the DAPS group meeting next Tuesday!! 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve heard such positive feedback, from him and others, I can&#x27;t 
wait 
&gt; &gt; to start experimenting. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As positive communications with the Mini are established, I&#x27;ll 
make 
&gt; &gt; sure other researchers are in the loop.

&gt; &gt; &gt; On the specs side, the MiniBox has controls for both scan rate 
as 
&gt; &gt; well
&gt; &gt; &gt; as sensitivity, so you can cut down on the amount of random 
noise 
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; also find a speed which seems clearer, whereas you cannot with 
the 
&gt; &gt; RS
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hack (as far as I know). The rechargeable battery lasts about 
40-50
&gt; &gt; &gt; hours on one charge... nothing to replace that way. It has both 
a
&gt; &gt; &gt; speaker output and one for a recorder so you can not only hear 
it as
&gt; &gt; &gt; loud as you like, but you can directly record your session from 
the 
&gt; &gt; box.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; When it comes to audible differences, the quality of the 
electronics
&gt; &gt; &gt; used provides clearer sound. I am not straining so much to hear
&gt; &gt; &gt; things. It is just speculation on my part, but it seems to take 
less
&gt; &gt; &gt; time and less effort for communication from the other side to 
come
&gt; &gt; &gt; through with the Mini. At least, in my experiences with both 
&gt; &gt; devices.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Though, I have gotten snippets from the RS Hack that were 
&gt; &gt; impressive.
