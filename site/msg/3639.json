As of yesterday morning I had not \ntried my modified (older version) 12-470 yet. Well, I took it to our \nlocal city cemetery yesterday afternoon to see what I could get. I \nvisited gravesites of people I knew had died tragically and quickly.  \nThey say those spirits never had a chance to express prior to being \ntaken, it was just too fast.\nAnyway, I just downloaded the third file and listened.  Oh my.... it \ngave me chills when I heard her voice at the last second of the \nrecording.  Am I hearing what I think I am hearing?  Can someone \nconfirm what is being said? (It is the last voice, I think saying three \nwords just before I turned the 12-470 off.\nI&#39;ve placed the file in the folder UFO Geek Files in the file section. \nIt&#39;s named leah_ann_3.wav\nThanks!\n- Mike"}
