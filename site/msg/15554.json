That is another story.\n&gt; I still have  Frank&#39;s box #29, the reason you never hear files from me \n&gt; using that  box is because it literally &quot;Sucks!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Most if not all Frank&#39;s  box is inherently filled with static white noise \n&gt; and that combined  with a metal echo box and noise generator makes it \nvery \n&gt; difficult to  hear anything let alone communication which is difficult \nenough \n&gt; to  hear from a quiet box likes the 125.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank&#39;s box has seen  it&#39;s day and s erved it&#39;s purpose in my opinion it \nis \n&gt; antiquated and  is no where near the quality of even a small cheap RS \n12-469 \n&gt; as far  as clarity of communication.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank is actually using the guts  from RS hacks to build his boxes now so \n&gt; why have a &quot;FRANKENBOX&quot; that  is essentially an RS hack with noise added \n&gt; instead of just buying an  RS box and getting better communication? \n&gt; \n&gt; Mind you this  is only my opinion but it is based on years of experience \n&gt; with every  box that is or has been used. I currently have 14 different \nboxes \n&gt; not  to mention EVP maker and I have done extensive sessions and research \n&gt;  with each and for my money you can give me a 20-125 every time, the \nFrank&#39;s  \n&gt; box should be retired to the box museum where it belongs.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am the only person in this research that will come out and speak  the \n&gt; truth about the Frank&#39;s box, there are many people now that have  them \nand the \n&gt; only person you will ever hear a file from is Steve Hula  and sometimes \n&gt; Frank himself, and Frank&#39;s file is so rough you may  hear 1 out of a \nhundred \n&gt; files the way he does due to the fact that he  does not even take the \ntime to \n&gt; do a proper session he just turns the  box on and records a couple of \nminute \n&gt; using his CELL PHONE !\n&gt;  \n&gt; Frank has his place in RTSC history due to his ALLEGED invention off  the \n&gt; first ghost box and he deserves the respect for his &quot;POSSIBLE&quot;  \n&gt; accomplishment but to be revered as a god in the box field NO not by  me \nanyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; I use the words &quot;ALLEGED&quot; and &quot;POSSIBLE&quot; in terms  of his being the first \n&gt; to create the ghost box due to some recent  information that has been \nbrought \n&gt; to my attention that concerns an  individual that created, built and used \nA \n&gt; Radio Sweeping Ghost Box in  1969.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am gathering information and documentation now and  will hopefully be \n&gt; ; able to dispel the myth of Frank assumption being  the father of the \nghost Box \n&gt; soon.\n&gt; \n&gt; That is to be  continued! \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; All is possible, nothing is  probable\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  ____________  ____  ____  _\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ************ ************&lt;WBR&gt;**Aedit Score is 750.
