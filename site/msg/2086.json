The ghosts who are producing the EVP&#39;s certainly don&#39;t \nhave brains. :-)\n\nI have no doubt that there may be a few people around who could create EVP \nphenomena in an electrronic device, but it would be an extremely small \nnumber. I think most of the EVP we get are from disembodied beings who \nhave figured out how to do it.\n\nZack\n\nOn Mon, 17 Sep 2007, Frank Sumption wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s not brain! We are all spirit, of course we can create our own EVPs. You don&#39;t suddenly become spirit when you die, you just wake up.
