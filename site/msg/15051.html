You can create a wave in anything. You can create=
 a wave in a rope by having a person hold each end and then having one pers=
on wiggle the rope. You can create a wave in a lake by dropping a rock into=
 it. The thing that carries the wave is the propagating medium. In these ex=
amples it's the rope and water respectively.

In the case of sound, the pro=
pagating medium is the air. It is a longitudinal pressure wave. It cannot b=
e picked up on a receiver that is capable of receiving the same frequencies=
 as electromagnetic waves.

There are receivers and antennas that can pick =
up electromagnetic waves of the same frequencies as sound waves. But in thi=
s case, the propagating medium is the aether. They are transverse electroma=
gnetic waves and you can't hear them.

The electromagnetic spectrum extends=
 from sub-audible frequencies all the way up to the frequencies of X-rays a=
nd cosmic rays. Different methods exist to detect or receive different part=
s of this spectrum. I'm involved in a ULF group that specializes in receivi=
ng electromagnetic waves of the Schumann resonances which are around 6 Hz, =
plus or minus.

A mistake that a lot of people make is thinking that there are two =

down with much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic waves can penetrate al=
most anything because of their wavelengths. The shorter the wavelength the =
more ways we can shield against them.

Think of microwaves. These are also =
a type of radio and telemetry transmitting wave but the waves also have a p=
hysical effect on our environment by causing molecules to speed up, which c=

Here is some food for thought. I am cur=
rently reviewing my audio from our May 30th investigation.
=C2=A0
It was me=
 and another girl teammate=C2=A0present in the room. I picked up a 3rd fema=
le voice on my digital voice recorder that I carry with me. We were standin=
g right next to another digital video recorder that I leave beside my night=
 vision camera. That recorder did not pick up this 3rd voice. I have asked =
the girl that was with me to check her recording to see if she picked it up=
.
=C2=A0
I have long felt the true EVP does not come from sound waves in th=
e environment, or then it wouldn't be EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow=
 EVP's are appearing directly on the recordings.
=C2=A0
This instance with =
the recorders may back that theory up. That other recorder should have pick=
ed that voice up if it were sound waves in the environment.
=C2=A0
I am att=
aching the clip of this 3rd voice. The=C2=A0file that is named=C2=A0"01-02-=
17 Clip" is the full clip.=C2=A0You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah", and=
 then another comes in right after that. I think I know what it says.
=C2=
=A0
Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but still did not hear this unti=
l playback. It isn't clear, so I am not as excited about it as my one's fro=
m the last investigation.

I have a running theory that EVP is =
carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to=
 manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic=
 waves that differ one another in frequency then if you add or subtract the=
m together you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if=
 a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a roo=
m creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermedia=
te difference=C2=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz=
 to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic equipment generate=
s ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From this theory I always fel=
t that EVP were generated within a few inches of the recorder.

We are able=
 to reproduce this affect in not only radio with superheterodyne systems bu=
t also with acoustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a commercial =
produce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.
