LOL yeah Frank maybe next time better filter the heavy traffic thru this fo=
rum and Bills site rather than put out your tripod site link, those cant ge=
t shut down. Then again=A0you better backup your site anyways just in case.=
 Or=A0someone could make you a "cover page" with links to the other places.=
 You still have that old XM=A0site it allows unlimited bandwith and traffic=
 and has a counter on it. Could do something there if you like. I know the =
other ones easier to update but it wont withstand so many people jumping on=
 all at once.
