Nathan:
                   I am sure all of us here are over the age of 18 years and have read the warning lables on all our boxes.  We thank you for the concern on our well being!  Oh, and promise not to turn me in, cause I removed the tags from my pillows!  I wouldn't want the Pillow Police to come and arrest me.  I wouldn't be able to do box research then.

2. Dangers which Mankind faces if SPIRICOM is not used wisely

Since his beginnings, Man has been faced with the fact that
individually and collectively he has the power to act for good or
evil. As his knowledge of the energetic nature of the cosmos has
expanded, Man has found that every energy so far identified -- from
sexual energy to atomic energy -- can be used for his benefit or for
his downfall. He will find that the energies involved in SPIRICOM are
also of a nature that can be used to help him grow mentally and
spiritually and become more God-like (that is more like the beings on
the higher planes) or they can be focused on trivia which will make it
even harder for him to grow out of the present deplorable mess in
which Western civilization's social, economic and political actions
are tending toward disintegration.

----------------

* For the spiritually oriented, we report some advice given by
high level spirit communicators: If SPIRICOM researchers adhere to the
following procedure they will not suffer possession by negative
forces. First thing in the morning say, "I will wear the protective
cloak of the Christ light until I retire tonight." On retiring make a
similar decree for the night hours. (Note: The Christ light is said to
have overshadowed and inspired Jesus of Nazareth continually during
the last three years of his earth life.)
