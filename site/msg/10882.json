I asked them if they were a&#39;&#39;couple&#39; and monique said &#39;yes we are&#39;and peter said &#39;no we&#39;re not&#39; so i guess they are having a bit of fun with me.  ;)\n  Im not sure what you mean by a hack, ( i do know what you mean by &#39;box&#39;--like franks box or a spiricom- which no- i use neither of these things) however a good friend of mine is coming over tongiht and i plan to try and fandangle him into building me a spiricom device...... *crossing fingers* lol! \n  I have been doing evps about 3 years now and just the other day i found several that Peter and Monique identify themselves by name- and they were with me when i lived in a different house 3 years ago... so when I heard them again on my recorder recently- i thought i would try and see just how much info they can share with me.. I have gotten LOTS of evps from other ppl in this house i am in now as well. The vast majority are kind- but there is someone who is either a low-level entity or isnt very evolved who leaves me the odd nasty statement....\n  Every house i have lived in has been very &#39;active &#39; so I finally decided to try and find out more abou them.\n  Have you been doing evps very long? do you have a haunt in your house? I will have to look and see what files you have in the group ( ive listened to almost all of them but forget whos is whos now lol)\n  what brought you into the field of paranormal research?\n  anyway, thanks again and look forward to chatting again soon\n  cheers   :)\n  Charm\n\nKristin Morris &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; wrote:\n              Hi Charm!\n  \n  I�ve been listening to your files and they are very intriguing.  Are these standard EVPs from an intelligent haunt of your own house?  Are you utilizing a hack or any other type of box to capture these?  \n  Kristin\n  \n      \n---------------------------------\n  \n  From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] \nSent: Friday, May 09, 2008 12:48 PM\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n\n  \n        \nHello,\n\nThis email message is a notification to let you know that\na file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \ngroup.\n\nFile : /Charm&#39;s Toybox/D72yesmaam3_CLR.mp3 \nUploaded by : charmedbyu20032003 &lt;charmedbyu20032003@...&gt; \nDescription : This morning ( May 9-08) I asked Monique if she was around.
