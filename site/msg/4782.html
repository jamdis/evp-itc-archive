&gt; Hi All,  I was listening, with my ear-cups type headphones that were plugged into the RS Hack 469, for maybe 30 mins., not tapping (ran out of tape), and in the forground could hear voice/words every now and then (EVP&#x27;s?), but . . . . in the background -throughout!- I could hear (but barely make out) a person -male- talking like from an interview! I had asked if anyone was here with a message, or if Mike &amp; Lisa was there, or if John Lennon would like to say something (was it him??), then listened!  Has any of you experienced this???  =Judy=
&gt;
  P.S. This effect, I got, is like doing the sweep/scan and not only hearing voices/words (popping up) but also like someone&#x27;s talking in the background thru-out the sweep/scan!!!   Anyone have this happen to them?  =Judy=</pre>
