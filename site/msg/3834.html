I&#x27;d  
&gt; &gt; &gt; love to hear from my Dad, but may have to wait a LONG time for 
that

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Again, I&#x27;ve got to speak up and say that I have heard his box, 
the  
&gt; &gt; one Frank gave him, do exactly that. And why in the heck 
shouldn&#x27;t  
&gt; &gt; it? That is exactly what human mediums--myself included--can do.  
&gt; &gt; Isn&#x27;t the box just taking it to a potentially purer, higher, and 
more  
&gt; &gt; stunning level?
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;d contact a lawyer - for infringment rights to your device  
&gt; &gt; &gt; (unauthorised use), on a contingency basis (pay if you win the  
&gt; &gt; &gt; lawsuit, from the winnings). Plus, you could get your boxes, 
Sony  
&gt; &gt; &gt; cassette recorder, and Tarot CD back, as well as put him outta  
&gt; &gt; &gt; business, before he does more damage! =Judy= P.S. He may know 
you  
&gt; &gt; &gt; well enought to know you&#x27;ll never sue him, too (and thus get 
away  
&gt; &gt; &gt; with it)! 8-(
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; _
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can&#x27;t sue for use of non-patented technology that was a gift. 
It  
&gt; &gt; would be very hard for Frank to prove otherwise.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ah, but what a hell of a civil trial it would be. There&#x27;s one 
I&#x27;d  
&gt; &gt; love to cover as a reporter....

&gt;  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =     Hi All, What&#x27;s to keep Chris 
from getting a Patent of his own on HIS &quot;Telephone to The Dead&quot;? Does 
Frank have his &quot;Franks Box&quot; Patented by the U.S. Patent Offices (the 
cost is low for this, BTW)???? I think it has merit thus far, for 
Frank to consider a Lawsuit! So what if it was a gift, Frank stated 
it was to be used in 1 place (statonary) &amp; for testing purposes ONLY. 
What Chris has done with it, is Run with it making several businesses 
with it and making a profit from it . . . . this is NOT what Frank 
intended HIS Box(es) to be used as!   =Judy=
