Usually recordings have far too muc=\r\nh noise for this\nto work well, which is why I like the clearer and cleaner =\r\nrecordings many people\ncall &#39;Class A&#39;.=A0 What I found got me to thinking a=\r\nnd I want to=A0share my thoughts.\n\nFirst, it&#39;s helpful to know that I have =\r\nquite a bit of professional experience studying\nspectra - from ULF up throu=\r\ngh sound and light and way into the region of radio\nwaves and even cosmic r=\r\nadiation. I have stared at more spectrum analyzers over\nthe decades than I =\r\ncare to count. So when I realized what I was seeing in Tom&#39;s\nrecording I wa=\r\ns a bit surprised I hadn&#39;t thought about it before.\n\nUsually when you look =\r\nat a visual representation of an audio recording, you can\nclearly see the n=\r\noise with the signal superimposed atop it. The higher the noise\nlevel relat=\r\nive to the signal level, the lower the &#39;signal-to-noise&#39; ratio which result=\r\ns\nin recordings that are very hard to hear. In a normal recording, such as =\r\nyou might \nmake of yourself speaking into a microphone, there is a specific=\r\n way the noise\nband disappears when the signal level gets high enough. But =\r\nmore than that, \nthis only occurs when the signal is introduced in the earl=\r\ny stages of audio \nprocessing - a noisy amplifier for example looks complet=\r\nely different than \na high level background noise with someone speaking ove=\r\nr it. And that&#39;s \nwhat is important here.\n\nWhat I noticed that got me think=\r\ning was that in the spectrum analysis, \nthe noise level was reasonable for =\r\nthis type of recording. And it was fairly\nconstant. It was what I have come=\r\n to see in these recordings except that\nthe signal to noise ratio was a bit=\r\n better. Meaning the signal was a bit \nclearer initially. When the sound (w=\r\nhich seems to be a young girl&#39;s\nvoice) begins, the noise level rapidly goes=\r\n down and almost completely\nvanishes while the signal goes high. This is wh=\r\ny you can clearly hear\nthe voice: the absence of noise as much as the signa=\r\nl level itself.\n\nNow here&#39;s what got me going. I realized that this specifi=\r\nc waveform\nsuggests strongly that the point of influence is not deep inside=\r\n the \nelectronics. Rather, it is at an exterior point, such as where the si=\r\ngnal\nfirst enters the system. And that would imply that something towards\nt=\r\nhe outer part of the electronics is being manipulated, and not the \nrecordi=\r\nng media or anything near it. \n\nThis would also explain why voice phenomena=\r\n can appear on different\nmedia and on different electronics such as transis=\r\ntor or solid state or\nvacuum tube. AAEVP has suggested, and based on this o=\r\nbservation\nI would agree, that the probable point of influence is a junctio=\r\nn near \nthe a front-end stage of an early amplifier circuit. Every electron=\r\nic \nsystem would have this in common.\n\nI have suggested before that I belie=\r\nve that at least some (probably \nthe higher quality) EVPs may be due to ope=\r\nrator PK influence.\nMicroPK is believed to operate at or near the molecular=\r\n level as \nevidenced by things such as healing. And healing agents have\nbee=\r\nn identified who have many similar traits to PK agents. So\nit follows they =\r\nmay employ similar abilities and use similar \nmechanisms.=A0 This observati=\r\non is entirely in line with this idea.\n\nDoes this mean that in truth no dis=\r\ncarnates are communicating?\nIn a dramatic demonstration of who I really am,=\r\n or more to the \npoint what I really believe, let me say that I&#39;m not yet s=\r\nure.\nMaybe they are, and maybe they are not. This evidence does\nnot tell us=\r\n that answer.\n\nThis is similar to work in mediumship research. We have show=\r\nn\nthat mediums can receive information they should not know in\ncontrolled l=\r\naboratory conditions. But we don&#39;t know scientifically\nwhere this informati=\r\non comes from. Apparitional experients are\nconvinced they have seen or hear=\r\nd the dead, but apparitions of \nthe living are quite common as well. The mo=\r\nre you learn about\nthis phenomena, the more you realize that many commoly \n=\r\naccepted=A0explanations fall short when applied in general.\n\nAs I wrote pre=\r\nviously, the real issue is that science today\ndoes=A0 not have the understa=\r\nnding or the tools to properly \nevaluate this data. Science cannot prove or=\r\n disprove this \nphenomena. Not today. An honest scientist (and skeptic)\nwil=\r\nl tell you this is an unknown, an anomaly. And so, as\nfolks here know, it c=\r\nomes down to belief in the absence \nof any protocol or experiment to clearl=\r\ny demonstrate the\nsource of these sounds.\n\nBut I for one feel comfortable t=\r\nhat higher quality recordings\nwill help move us along, if for no other reas=\r\non than we can \neliminate some variables. The analysis I mentioned can&#39;t \nb=\r\ne done on noisier recordings; it took a very quiet one to\nbe able to see th=\r\nis clearly. And that&#39;s what triggered my \nthoughts.\n\nI also noticed a tiny =\r\nspike before and after the higher\nquality speech. To some this might sugges=\r\nt an edit, \nbut in this case I don&#39;t think that happened - here&#39;s why.\nYou =\r\ncan see the signal emerging from the noise when\nnoise is still present and =\r\nonly when it achieves a certain\nlevel is the noise suppressed. Had this bee=\r\nn an edit, \nthe noise level on this close a scrutiny would have \nbeen a bit=\r\n more obvious - unless the editor got very lucky.\nBut in consideration of h=\r\now the voice appears and \nalso the fact that similar low-level spikes appea=\r\nr \nelsewhere in the recording, it would seem more likely\nthat the spikes ar=\r\ne artifacts of the tuning that&#39;s going\non or some other random events.\n\nOnc=\r\ne again, this makes the case for me at least \nfor trying to get the highest=\r\n quality possible. These\nare the kinds of=A0recordings which scientists may=\r\n be \nable to use sooner than later as understanding and \ntools inevitably i=\r\nmprove.\n\nOne last thought regarding the notion of PK as an \nexplanation. It=\r\n is very important we come to understand\nPK well. Only then might it actual=\r\nly be used in a \npractical way. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard or thought about\na wo=\r\nrld where you could literally turn things on and off\nwith your mind. Or typ=\r\ne simply by thinking about it.\nBelieve it or not, one way forward to such t=\r\nechnology\ncould well be through the understanding of PK. So much\nof Parapsy=\r\nchology is actually exploring the leading edge\n(some might say &#39;bleeding&#39; e=\r\ndge) of science. It shows us\nwhere things might go and, frankly, that is on=\r\ne interesting\nworld at least for me. That&#39;s why I have been in the field\nfo=\r\nr many decades.\n\nApologies for the long post, but I thought some might \nfin=\r\nd it useful and informative.\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-83821153-1276282792=:43583\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1=\r\n0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;I was listening to Tom&#39;s very clear recording and decided to put =\r\nit through Audacity&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;so I could view the spectrum.
