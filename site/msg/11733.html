<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The website, www.paranormalunderworld.com is still up, and there is an
event advertised that was supposed to take place in July of this year.
What&#x27;s up with that?

&gt; I would like to make all aware  that paranormal underworld no longer
&gt; exist, nor dose on line production .  This was my creation. I had the
&gt; idea and , brought it to the paranormal community . We have not done a
&gt; alive event in over 2 year. Nor has there been  attempt. It was a
&gt; great concept. But unfortunately  it never took off . I will not have
&gt; my name associated with something that boarders on fraud. 
&gt;     I am more than willing to share the temp plates , and the
&gt; technology, and what is needed at the location,  and how  I set this
&gt; up  for free .I will gladly explain  what server I used, and how to 
&gt; present a event what equipment  that is required, and how  it was
&gt; promoted ,  also I will tell you the problems I ran in to so you can
&gt; avoid them, as well as what I enjoyed about this,  my experience is at
&gt; your disposal, all I ask  for is a invite to the event .  
&gt;          If any one is interested you can contact me at
&gt; shadow71414@... I will do my best to get back to you in 24
&gt; hours. Or I am more than willing to give my cell number out and I do
&gt; return calls promptly .
