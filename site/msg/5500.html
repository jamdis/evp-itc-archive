Bruce,No problem, you are entitled to your perspect=
ive and opinion. I really don't see anywhere in my post, a stance being mad=
e beside my agreeing with Sumption. Since you mentioned it, I have a proble=
m with people who consider themselves to be advanced researchers in ITC tel=
ling others that there are things you need protection from in this field. I=
 have seen this fear mongering over the many years I have been involved wit=
h my research and the research of colleagues and associates and it has neve=
r helped anyone. Are there negative entities out there that want to influen=
ce you and distract you? Sure there are! Probably just as many who want to =
help you and they have been there since the beginning of each of our lives.=
The rule of thumb in dealing with those negative forces is to not follow th=
eir messages. If the message is basically negative then give it no merit an=
d carry on. No ritual needed! Now if you want credentials I can give you my=
 "paranormal resume" and let the pissing contest begin. All you need to kno=
w about me is I know enough to know that the more I learn and experience th=
e more I realize I have a lot to learn. Ego you say, not at all. Best regar=
ds,Frank R.

 read

Frank,Let me say at the onset this is not meant as an attack and I w=
ill not get into a pissing match over it, but I did feel I needed to addres=
s it.I promised myself that I would not post a response to any one person,o=
nly to a subject in general, but I will have to break that promise on this =
one.I think your response to the ritual protection post was egotistical, ca=
reless and uninformed. That was the response I would expect from a close mi=
nded sceptic that had no real experience in this field.As a researcher in t=
he paranormal in general you should know that there is a very real and pres=
ent danger from darker entities, especially in the field of box research th=
at is still in its infancy and our knowledge is not advanced enough using t=
his method to be so hap hazard about it.All are entitled to their own opini=
on as far as the way they go about their own research but to advise that pr=
otection from the negative means nothing and to do it in an open forum wher=
e there are impressionable new individuals that are just entering into this=
 research is very careless on your part.Some researchers here including Ste=
ve and myself among other have recorded files with messages that tell us th=
at the communication process is being hindered at that time by what we refe=
r to as "dark heads" and our spirit contacts actually use that term. they h=
ave also told us when asked why communication was so bad that it was being =
blocked by negative entities. I only one of a few that have gotten this exa=
ct communication. So there is a real threat from negative energy or entitie=
s.Plus through research we have found that it is possible for entities to t=
ravel back and forth between our realms during an open box session. If you =
listened to numerous files Steve and I have posted asking our friends mike =
and Lisa on the other side to insure that all and any spirits that may have=
 traveled through please go back and have gotten conformation from them eve=
ry time.If it is possible for an entity to travel through the portal that a=
 box MAY produce then it stands to reason it is possible that it can be a d=
ark entity.As far as fear goes, I agree wholeheartedly, fear definitely fee=
ds the negative. And that is my point. The protection ritual does not creat=
e a relative tangible barrier, it is simply a metaphoric symbol of putting =
your mind in the right place so as not to feed this negative energy.And the=
 protection we receive from our tech/guides on the other side in my belief =
is very real, I believe they do actually run interference for us as far as =
negativity goes and the part of the ritual where we invoke their help is ju=
st a form of respect and acknowledgement that they are constantly watching =
out for us.this being said, Of course everyone will adhere to their own bel=
iefs as far as this subject is concerned. I just felt that your response wa=
s a little strong and came more from the attitude that I also suffer from t=
hat is to say " negative spirit yeah bring it on"But that is not a logical =
thought out approach to an existing concern.So make the ritual available fo=
r anyone that wants to use it and the experienced information to go with it=
.My most important concern is the welfare and teaching and eventual success=
 of new researcher and this research as a whole.Bruce
