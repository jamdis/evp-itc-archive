Just to update and sh=
are some information I provide the following... 
As many of you know, I hav=
e asked 8 ITC researchers to assist me with 
an ITC session involving plane=
 crash debris. I sent those 8 
researchers an envelope containing the debri=
s and asked them to use it 
in five, 30 second sessions and send me the aud=
io files. I gave them 
no detailed information, except that it was a commer=
cial plane crash to 
keep the sessions more controlled.
Today I received th=
e first of the audio files from one of those 
researchers. After listening =
to his third file, my jaw dropped after 
hearing what I did.
This is very p=
romising, and I hope to get additional relivant files 
from the other resea=
rchers.
I'll be sharing all the details in the video I'll be putting on my =

Youtube page early next year.

Thanks to all of you who are participating!=
