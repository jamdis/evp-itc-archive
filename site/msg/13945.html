At a time like t=
his, people need facts and information.=C2=A0 Here is what I posted to my o=
wn group this morning.
________

I don't want to sounds like an alarmist, b=
ut this could get to be very bad. So
far there are 40 cases here in the USA=
 and no cases have been reported in the Mid-south area.

I thought I would =
look up some info to inform and clear up any misconceptions.

The bad news =
is this strain of flu can be fatal. But the good news is it can
also be tre=
ated with two different drugs. They are Tamiflu and Relenza.

One of the be=
st things to always do is wash your hands after handling anything
and being=
 out in the public. A little trick I learned a long time ago is to
sing to =
yourself the Birthday song while washing your hands. I know it sounds
silly=
, but it ensures that you hands are properly cleaned. "Happy birthday to
me=
, happy birthday to me, happy birthday dear ______, happy birthday to me." =

Silly, but it works LOL :-)

Swine=
 Flu FAQ
WebMD Provides Answers to Your Questions About Swine Flu
By Mirand=
a Hitti

The swine flu virus in the U.S. is the same one causing a deadly e=
pidemic in
Mexico. What is swine flu? What can we do about it? WebMD answer=
s your
questions.

What is swine flu?
Like people, pigs can get influenza (=
flu), but swine flu viruses aren't the same
as human flu viruses. Swine flu=
 doesn't often infect people, and the rare human
cases that have occurred i=
n the past have mainly affected people who had direct
contact with pigs. Bu=
t the current swine flu outbreak is different. It's caused
by a new swine f=
lu virus that has spread from person to person -- and it's
happening among =
people who haven't had any contact with pigs.

What are swine flu symptoms?=

Symptoms of swine flu are like regular flu symptoms and include fever, cou=
gh,
sore throat, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue. Some people hav=
e
reported diarrhea and vomiting associated with swine flu. Those symptoms =
can
also be caused by many other conditions, and that means that you and yo=
ur doctor
can't know, just based on your symptoms, if you've got swine flu.=
 It takes a lab
test to tell whether it's swine flu or some other condition=
.

If I think I have swine flu, what should I do? When should I see my doct=
or?
If you have flu symptoms, stay home, and when you cough or sneeze, cove=
r your
mouth and nose with a tissue. Afterward, throw the tissue in the tra=
sh and wash
your hands. That will help prevent your flu from spreading.

If=
 you've got flu symptoms, and you've recently been to a high-risk area like=

Mexico, CDC officials recommend that you see your doctor. If you have flu
=
symptoms but you haven't been in a high-risk area, you can still see a doct=
or --
that's your call.

Keep in mind that your doctor will not be able to =
determine whether you have
swine flu, but he or she would take a sample fro=
m you and send it to a state
health department lab for testing to see if it=
's swine flu. If your doctor
suspects swine flu, he or she would be able to=
 write you a prescription for
Tamiflu or Relenza. Those drugs may not be re=
quired; U.S. swine flu patients
have made a full recovery without it.

I Go=
t a Flu Shot. Am I Protected Against Swine Flu?
No. There is currently no s=
wine flu vaccine.

It's possible that the seasonal flu vaccine might provid=
e partial protection
against H3N2 swine flu bugs. But the strain that appea=
red in California is the
H1N1 swine flu strain. It is very different from t=
he H1N1 human flu strain
included in the seasonal flu vaccine.

It's not kn=
own whether previous infection with human type A H1N1 flu might
provide par=
tial protection against the type A H1N1 swine flu in the current
outbreak.
=

However, the CDC has made a "vaccine seed" from swine flu isolated from an=

infected person, and has begun the process of developing a vaccine should =
the
need arise. Whether a vaccine could be produced in quantity by next flu=
 season
is a huge question.

How Serious Is the Public Health Threat of a S=
wine Flu Epidemic?
Any flu epidemic is worrisome, especially when a new str=
ain of flu bug is
involved.

"Influenza A viruses new to the human populati=
on that are able to efficiently
transmit from person to person and cause il=
lness may represent a pandemic
threat," the CDC warns.

It's worrisome that=
, unlike seasonal flu, the swine flu outbreak in Mexico is
attacking health=
y young people. That's a hallmark of pandemic flu bugs.

But it takes more =
than a new virus spreading among humans to make a pandemic.
The virus has t=
o be able to spread efficiently from one person to another, and
transmissio=
n has to be sustained over time. In addition, the virus has to spread
geogr=
aphically.

Is There a Treatment for Swine Flu?
Yes. While the swine flu bu=
g is resistant to older flu medicines, it remains
sensitive to Tamiflu and =
to Relenza.

Can You Get Swine Flu by Eating Pork?
No. You can only catch s=
wine flu from being around an infected pig -- or, if
it's the new swine flu=
 virus, from an infected person.
