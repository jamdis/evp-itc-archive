I still hold on to the idea that if you can get your sweep speed measurement you can find a way to legitimize communication on variou speeds.  However, that&#39;s not nearly as easy and surefire as simply setting your speed so fast that it is categorically unquestionable, if you have a radio with adjustable speed.  I don&#39;t think a fast speed is a detriment to hearing them.  If they want to come through and communicate they seem to be able to find a way to do it at both faster and slower speeds, from what I&#39;ve seen so far.  You simply have to keep your ears open to new sounds.  When you begin communicating at a speed you&#39;ve never used before, I would suggest asking them questions that require predictable answers like yes/no, days of the week, months, colors, etc. so you have an approximate idea what to listen for... \n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Urkel23&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I always keep the sweep at a very fast pace, most don&#39;t like it like that.  I trained myself to listen that way, i never get questioned by the skeptics.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you hear a voice that&#39;s crystal clear, it&#39;s most likely just radio.  The communication doesn&#39;t come over that way usually.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would suggest a test for anybody on this forum.  Set you ghost box at a super fast rate, then just sit back and listen.  After a while you will hear them talk, but you have to get used to listening that way.\n&gt; \n&gt; I feel that it&#39;s the only legitimate way to do this.  Just my opinion on that topic.  If i hear someone&#39;s file with a slow sweep, i ignore it as communication for the most part.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Adriana Jones&quot; &lt;adrianamjones@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On your FM \n&gt; &gt; at second 10-12 I hear &quot;telephone&quot; and a fainter &quot;hello?&quot; I&#39;ve gotten one or two &quot;telephone-hello&quot; voices myself.

These along with the &quot;I love you&quot;s are a good sign to hear, it means whoever is on the other side is feeling happy right now.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; around sec 33-35 a man says quickly &quot;I&#39;ve paid a bit cause of you&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; sec 42-43 &quot;wait, just come&quot; harmonic/singing higher pitch\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; sec 44-45 &quot;the people are talking to me&quot; also harmonic/singing higher pitch, I think in response to the message at sec 42-43\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; sec 46-48 &quot;you must do it&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; sec 49-51 &quot;did you say do that?&quot; another high synth voice\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; at 1:02 there&#39;s the &quot;I love you&quot; :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; there are so many more communications just on your FM sample, but some are too quick/blurry to decipher quickly, but there are definitely way many more!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; AM sample:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; wow, I hear so much am not sure what&#39;s communication and what&#39;s just radio, I&#39;m also not used to listening to am... what&#39;s the sweep speed, will it be possible for any full words to come through at all?
