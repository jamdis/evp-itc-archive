I don't think I'll be giving out my home address as part of these tests.

RJ, if you live in or near a large city, like Denver, how about writing a =
number in chalk on a public building where it won't be noticed right away, =
and can be erased easily after the contest?  That way, any spirits could lo=
cate the building, post, bridge, or whatever, and see if they can see the c=
halk number or other symbol?  This might make it easier than trying to loca=
te your home, with only an internet nickname to go by.  Just a thought.
