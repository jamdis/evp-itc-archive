&gt; I think you may be the one mishearing, my friend.
&gt; 
&gt; I say to you clearly, now, that Chris Moon is free to do whatever the  
&gt; heck he wants with his box, but he is not free to try to dissuade us  
&gt; from experimenting, too. I have formed an opinion that he is inclined  
&gt; to control the message by reading his own words and hearing his own  
&gt; words on the radio and on tapes of his sessions, and I cannot  
&gt; logically interpret them in any other way. Since you don&#x27;t agree, If  
&gt; you would like to directly quote him to prove otherwise, then I am  
&gt; always ready to modify my opinions. Truly. But I am not going to  
&gt; change my mind without evidence.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t pull my opinions out of a void. I have seen what are, at this  
&gt; point, *generations* of paranormal researchers try to control the  
&gt; message and the process by saying that only the Special get to be  
&gt; part of the circle or the gang or the team or the bridge, or  
&gt; whatever. I have seen every single one of these units explode or  
&gt; implode or turn into a nascent religion over the control issues of a  
&gt; dominant person. I do not like this messianic behavior because it has  
&gt; ruined what was otherwise a potentially profitable avenue of  
&gt; research. Because I don&#x27;t talk about my own history or abilities  
&gt; often, and because I don&#x27;t yet have a box, that does not mean that I  
&gt; am not a hoary old raven with a hell of a lot of perspective on this.  
&gt; I&#x27;ve watched it happen again and again and again--thank goodness,  
&gt; mostly from a distance.

&gt; &gt; &gt; No, Chris is allowed to say he is talking to Barney for all I care.
&gt; &gt; &gt; What I hear him doing is telling others that he knows better than
&gt; &gt; &gt; they do. He does not. Period.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, Chris was asked to take the box and was told

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;they&quot; wanted him to have it. I don&#x27;t think &quot;they&quot; said to have  
&gt; &gt; him
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take it on loan like a library book.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And just so I understand correctly... Everyone but Chris is  
&gt; &gt; allowed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; state his opinions. Is that right?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I for one appreciate the openness and the willingness of this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; group of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people to open up the technology to anyone and everyone  
&gt; &gt; willing to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; put in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time and effort that is so blatantly needed. I don&#x27;t know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris Moon
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I have heard him on C2C and have read his opinions. I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always weary
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of anyone claiming to be one of a &quot;chosen few&quot; and using  
&gt; &gt; fear to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; further
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their arguments.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The fear-based reasoning&#x27;s and omni-potent subterfuge  
&gt; &gt; employed by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mr. Moon
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only tells me to ignore him and anyone else like him. There  
&gt; &gt; is no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manual or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; class  this research is done by Joe-Schmo in his basement and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; therefore
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open to many different interpretations and methodologies. Take
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the good 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; delete the bad. I believe in Karma  even if she is only my

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi All;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, the thing, the equiment I make, and experiment with  
&gt; &gt; as a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; device for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ITC, Instrumental Trans-Communication, also now know as  
&gt; &gt; Franks&#x27;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Box, or the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ghost box (that&#x27;s also an audio devioce,a nd photography  
&gt; &gt; device)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was never
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; described by me, it&#x27;s inverntor, as the &quot;Telephone to the  
&gt; &gt; Dead&quot;,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that label
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was put on my equipment, loaned to Moon for testing, he was  
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; want to test the box, he is not, and was not designated by me
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;primary tester&quot;. In fact he has yet to pay anything for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boxes he has,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or any of the other equipment he &quot;barrowed&quot;, such as the Sony
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pocket size
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cassette recorder, and Tarot CD, he still has. Moon is the one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that claims
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only he, or a designated trainee can properly interpret the  
&gt; &gt; output
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box, despite the fact that I have stated numerous times that I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; made the box
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for anyone to use, and one&#x27;s results are any no better or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supercede in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyway the results of anyone else.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now when someone claims that these new system don&#x27;t work,  
&gt; &gt; or only
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evil spirits, and even open portals so demons, or what not can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enter, they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are lying, and attempting to keep the use of any equipment,  
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirit communication for themselves. The motive being  
&gt; &gt; priofit,a s
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; far as I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can tell. The portal thing is Hollywood! I use my equimpemt  
&gt; &gt; in my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; basement,.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and have sinece 2000, amnd have never expereinced anything  
&gt; &gt; I could
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; call evil
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beside soem cussing, nakme calling voices, which is hardly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; threatening
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except to maybe 13 year old girl.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I must point put, because of preivisou threats, that  
&gt; &gt; slander is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stating
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something in public about a person that is knowingly  
&gt; &gt; untrue. So
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comptemplating such threats I can say only-- Bring It, I  
&gt; &gt; will have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything you own!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Frank, Perhaps you can talk to an attorney to sue Chris for  
&gt; &gt; using
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his &#x27;Borrowed&quot; &amp; on &quot;Loan&quot; Frank&#x27;s Box (&amp; Tarot CD) of YOURS  
&gt; &gt; (you own
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it still) and refuses to return it to you (once you send him a  
&gt; &gt; letter
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to return YOUR property back &amp; to stop spreading lies about it  
&gt; &gt; to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Public)???? Put him &quot;out of business&quot; in making money/profits from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; YOUR box! This seem unethical in what he&#x27;s now doing, don&#x27;t ya  
&gt; &gt; think?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My 2c worth. Makes me annoyed! =Judy= .
