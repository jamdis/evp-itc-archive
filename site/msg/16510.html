<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Wow.  They really said that?  It goes along with the end of the world stuff, though, doesn&#x27;t it?  Why oh why do they say stuff like that?  Just to keep us interested and talking to them?

(Although they may have something with the Egyptians and the space flight!)

&gt;  Sort of,, &quot;they&quot; claim I&#x27;m their long lost Purple Princess, kidnapped from
&gt; my home planet long ago when Earth had space flight by the ancient
&gt; Egyptians. I couldn&#x27;t be rescued at that time, so I was transported forward
&gt; in time, to now, at the end of the current Earth cycle when I could go home.
&gt; It gets wierd from there. Other entities that talk though the box claim they
&gt; a woman where I should be.

&gt; &gt; I can&#x27;t remember: Did they ever explain to you why they call you Purple?
&gt; &gt; Could this be the color of your aura or something? If so, maybe they really
&gt; &gt; can &quot;see&quot; us and our surroundings, and not just read our minds and see the
&gt; &gt; world through our eyes?

&gt; &gt; &gt; So far, I have not heard of anyone else being told they are &quot;The
&gt; &gt; Princess&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; or &quot;Purple&quot;, so I think we do have our own groups, plus normal spirits
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; communicate. I get a bgi mix of different voices and entities.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for answering me, because I was wondering if the &quot;I love yous&quot;
&gt; &gt; were
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something characteristic of just the entities I&#x27;m talking to (maybe
&gt; &gt; even the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same entity over and over again), or characteristic of most entities in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; general -- like they have different priorities on what constitutes an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important message once a person has died. For instance, my father I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certain would&#x27;ve told me to move the trees I&#x27;d planted over the septic
&gt; &gt; tank,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but would&#x27;ve never said &quot;I love you.&quot; Maybe once he&#x27;s dead, everything
&gt; &gt; looks
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different to him? (That&#x27;s providing I&#x27;m really talking to dead people,
&gt; &gt; which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m starting to wonder about.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m also noticing a tendency for the names I&#x27;m getting lately to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Biblical: Joseph and Michael have come through strongly, and I have no
&gt; &gt; clue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who they are. Maybe they make a name in order to talk to me?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve also been reading more about how there can be seemingly different
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; groups of entities competing to talk:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://othersidecommunications.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=11
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I witnessed this, I think, myself when my uncle came through (giving
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supporting evidence that it truly was him) and I also heard someone say
&gt; &gt; &quot;Get
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away from me.&quot; So maybe our dead relatives are indeed there, but other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; entities, wanting to hog the spotlight, get in the way or skew what our
&gt; &gt; dead
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relatives say? Just a thought.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I get those two. I rarely get last names. names have menaing on this

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but none of us are the same person in death, this is just one

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On New Year&#x27;s Eve and New Year&#x27;s Day I did two sessions with two
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different sets of participants. The messages always seem to be the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though: &quot;I love you.&quot; Over and over, threading all through the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recording,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both in the background, and more overtly when I ask a specific
&gt; &gt; question
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as, &quot;Do you have a message for Heather?&quot; Does anyone else get this?
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it&#x27;s flattering and all, but it doesn&#x27;t really mean that much when
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know for sure who&#x27;s telling me this.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, &quot;they&quot; seem quite ready to tell me their first names, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; almost
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never their last names. Why? Do last names cease to exist on the
&gt; &gt; other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; side?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or is there some unwritten rule that says verifiable information
&gt; &gt; can&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; passed along? If so, who makes and enforces these rules?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if they can so easily say a name four times in a row
&gt; &gt; (yesterday
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was my friend&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s name Donald), why can&#x27;t they say one
&gt; &gt; word
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me that would mean something? Or to my friend Heather? We both
&gt; &gt; asked,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got nothing, at least not that we could discern. It would seem a
&gt; &gt; simple
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thing to say the word plumber (that was my dad&#x27;s secret word) or
&gt; &gt; some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; single-syllable word. Now I&#x27;m pretty sure I really did talk to my
&gt; &gt; dad,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had another &quot;contact&quot; from him in my waking dream state the other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; morning,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but if it&#x27;s really him, why can&#x27;t he say something he would&#x27;ve said
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why do I have the nagging feeling that &quot;they&quot; aren&#x27;t human and
&gt; &gt; never
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just don&#x27;t get it! Any thoughts, guys?
