I happened to tune in on this paranormal radio just as they \nmentioned my site.  I was able to download the podcast and put it on \nmy site under &quot;Radio Broadcast&quot;.  Another thing i did was create a \nfolder called &quot;Box test audio&quot;, basically i uploaded 2 ten minute \nfiles of each of my boxes playing and than made 2 folders on my \nmessage board entitled box #1 and box #2.  And i want people to listen \nand write what they think they heard and at what time it was in the \nfile so i can review.  I thought this would be a good way for people \nto hear a full session and come to there own conclusion and also get \ninvolved. If you&#39;d like to check it out:\n\nIt&#39;s www.keyportparanormal.com\n\nI update frequently and have some cool stuff on there.\n\n-Steve H."}
