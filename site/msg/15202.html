Okay this part is easy to understand, but what do you build into the board =
to make the sweep linear.=A0 I think you talked about a sweep chip before.=
=A0 Is there a "linear sweep chip" that you install?

Sweep is making the radio tune across the b=
and, the modes are random, linear or manual. Random jumps arounds around th=
e band-randomly, the idea being that the entities would comtrol the sweep b=
y affecting the white noise transistor, and they did say they do that. Line=
ar is a smooth sweep up, then back down the band, the entities seem to have=
 an easier time tracking the linear sweep. Manual is done by hand on a chea=
py radio with a tuning knob, it's easier wiht a radio that has a tuning kno=
b that does the half turn from one end of the band to the other. 

When I f=
irst started using linear mode, I couldn't hear any of the usual voices, th=
en all the sudden, I could hear it. So I'm uncertain if it's the brain that=
 has to adjust, of what if you have to create/allow the possiblity? I used =
to use radnom exclusivley, and that worked well, now I get litte with rando=
m mode. 

I use linear now becuase it's much easier to get the circuit to w=
ork. Random can be finicky, as you're trying to get random pulses to be amp=
lified, and passed through the circuit.

 There's alot of steps invloved, like first you need a tuner--a voltage tun=
able radio. Then you have to decide what sweep modes you wants, Then whethe=
r or not you'll use an echo chamber, or need line outputs to record from. T=
hen, what kind of board it'll be on, and last build a cabinet.
