I&#39;ll try to check the archives to make sure \nthese haven&#39;t already been discussed to death before I ask.  Also, is \nthere a FAQ I could look at?  OTOH, it may be helpful to have basic \nquestions revisited from time to time in case anyone has come up with \nnew ideas about them.\n\nAnyway, first question -  I&#39;ve had a couple of instances where I heard a \nresponse loud and clear at the time, but on playback, the words are \nactually quite faint.  Is there a technological reason for that?  I have \na decent degree of psychic ability and am working with a spirit whom \nI&#39;ve been communicating with telepathically for over a year.  Is is more \nlikely that I am picking up on the answer psychically as well, which \namps up how I perceive it at the time?  And would his communicating with \nme psychically divert some of his energy from the ghost box \ncommunication, which would also explain why it came through fainter on that?\n\nI don&#39;t want to exhaust you with a bunch of questions all at once, so \nI&#39;ll save the rest for later.  You&#39;d start to feel like you&#39;re dealing \nwit a 5 year old - &quot;Why, why, why, why, why?!!!&quot;  =)\n\n\nNellie"}
