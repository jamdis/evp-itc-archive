          Hi! My name is Nellie and I am a new convert to ITC work. I've been
doing evps for a few years with a fair amount of success. One of the
things I have been experimenting with is using music. I play music
from the lifetimes of the spirits I'm trying to communicate with to
get the spirits intrigued enough to talk more. I took a quick look at
some of the old messages here, and will definitely have to experiment
with some of the suggestions you all have had about using music as
more of a carrier wave to make it easier for them to speak through.

What drew me to this group, though, is that I just made a Radio Shack
hack a couple of days ago and have been completely stunned by the
results. I'm getting more communications through it in 15 minutes
than I would usually get in evps over hours. I am absolutely blown
away. Even more interesting is that a spirit in my house who I've
never been able to get evps from is quite the chatterbox through the
hack. I have a couple of my first files in the folder Nellie's Files
that I found particularly interesting.

Anyway, I am looking forward to learning from/with you all.
