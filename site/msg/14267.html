Sorry, My bad. I uploaded many large wav files last night.
I am new to this and I DIDN'T read the STICKY. I did notice the 100mb
limit was near exceeded, but silly me thought that was MY personal limit (and I was scratching my head wondering how I already had 56%. Haha. Please try to contact me if I need to take down some of the files I uploaded. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, "April Abercrombie" <april@...> wrote:

>

For instance one member has posted about 10 files in mp3 format which didnt even equal 1/4 of the space taken up by another members single wav format file. When it comes down to being 98% full you realize some changes have to be made and this is just one of the many changes this group has had to make to allow more members to join us and have fair access.

I like the idea of post now then remove after a time period but the truth is that some peoples files need to remain without restraint such as Stefans who has been more than generous to post some files which may come in very handy for some of you to experiment with using his EVPmaker software. These files are for the group as a whole to make use of and they will not be deleted.

When there were only 5 of us here it wasnt a big deal, but once you get past 500 it starts to take a toll and sacrifices must be made. Ive deleted alot of things I didnt wish to and had to ask alot of members who have been around a very long time to help clear some space and they did so willingly for the betterment of the group. They had some really great files too. Most now share them other ways including Sumption who started this group himself.

I can just keep them on my pc, or put them on the extra drive, or post then take them down each time, I've been getting some really cool stuff, now, there was a really funny one, this lady's voice came on and says, "are you ghost hunting." lol I told her yes, I need them volunteers to help me clean up this house. My ghosts so far are very nice, even one said "i love you." that was sweet.  Love them too. <s>

Esnips is very easy to use it has two uploading options in case you cant use the java application use the single file uploader. Works a lot like email upload attachments.

Posting from email as an attachment also works just not so well for the very large file sizes. There are many other file sharing storage places besides esnips. We just like the layout there and the ability to share with friends including sharing storage space.
