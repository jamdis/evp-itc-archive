As mentioned, I&#39;ll be arriving on the 28th of March, and will return to pick up someone at the airport on the 1st of April, then I&#39;ll come off Estes Park on the 5th. Any of those days will work if it works for you. The 1st of April is particularly good if you&#39;re fine with that. I really look forward to meeting you.\n   \n  Bill Murphy\n\nFrank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hi All;\n\nThis is how I make the &quot;echo box&quot;.
