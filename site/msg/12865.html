<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Good question. I&#x27;m so used to doing thorough searches on Internet for data 
before I buy it that I almost never have to buy any sort of data sheets or 
instruction books anymore. I did have to buy a manual on how to CLA 
(clean, lubricate and adjust) a Rapax large-format camera shutter because 
the full info wasn&#x27;t available on-line.

But a lot of people aren&#x27;t used to such searches and probably would just 
pay out the money.  And look at the spammers.  If someone weren&#x27;t falling 
for their garbage they would all just dry up and blow away. There must be 
at least a few dumb people out there.

&gt; It was brought to my attention that a guy named Dave Oester is selling
&gt; an ebook on how to modify the Radio Shack 12-469, something he calls
&gt; the &#x27;Digcom&#x27;. (Isn&#x27;t it just the Radio Shack Hack?)
&gt; Has anyone purchased this book? Has anyone had dealings with this Dave
&gt; Oester?  I guess he produces other types of ebooks too.
&gt;
&gt; There is so much FREE information out there on how to modify the 12-
&gt; 469, I wonder if his book is actually selling...
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
