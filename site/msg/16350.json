If that&#39;s the case, a hacked RS radio using it&#39;s speaker constitutes an EM Pump. or is it something else entirely? Basically Frank&#39;s Box is an EM pump. Or not but maybe so. LOL! FM modulators for MP3 players, I have a few. FM sweeps okay for white noise? How do I get a Belkin TuneCast II to keep scanning? I&#39;ll let you know if I find out.\n\nThanks,\n\nMark"}
