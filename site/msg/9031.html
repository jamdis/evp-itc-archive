<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You&#x27;re welcome, Laura.  No need for embarrassment.  There&#x27;s OODLES of stuff I don&#x27;t 
know and have to ask others for technical help, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to help someone 
else once in a while.  

LOL - The running joke with my husband is when I start asking for the &quot;thingymajigger&quot; 
that goes to the &quot;doohicky&quot; when I don&#x27;t know the proper names of items.  Fortunately for 
me, he can usually figure out what I&#x27;m meaning! 

Absolutely, you are gonna learn and get it all together correctly.  :-)

&gt; Hey thank you Margaret.  I think you are right.  At least now I know 
&gt; what to look for, thanks to you.  How embarassing...oh well, have to 
&gt; ask if I&#x27;m gonna learn and get it all together correctly. 
&gt; thanks again for your help.

&gt; &gt; Hi Laura.  I use Audacity to record box/radio sweep sessions, but I 
&gt; find that using it for 
&gt; &gt; &#x27;traditional&#x27; EVP purposes hasn&#x27;t worked for me.  When I do 
&gt; traditional EVP sessions, I use 
&gt; &gt; any of my digital recorders (which is where the EVP seem to be 
&gt; formed best, not when 
&gt; &gt; using the computer) then play the file from my recorder into my 
&gt; computer, so I can better 
&gt; &gt; review the content of the session as well as edit, save, share, 
&gt; etc.  So yes, you still need a 
&gt; &gt; patch cable.  :-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think the confusion may have been when you told them at Radio 
&gt; Shack that you wanted 
&gt; &gt; to connect your mic of the recorder to the mic of your computer??  
&gt; What you want to do is 
&gt; &gt; connect the EAR/HEADPHONE to the computer.  So, instead of 
&gt; listening through the 
&gt; &gt; speaker of the recorder, or plugging in headphones and listening 
&gt; with your ears, you are 
&gt; &gt; going to play the file and let your computer hear it through the 
&gt; cable.  Hope that makes 
&gt; &gt; sense.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Just press the record button on Audacity, then press the play 
&gt; button on your recorder, and 
&gt; &gt; it will start recording in the computer.  Then save your session.  
&gt; After that you can edit, 
&gt; &gt; isolate areas, export WAV files, etc.  If you want to be able to 
&gt; export MP3 format, you have 
&gt; &gt; to download/install the LAME add-on for Audacity.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Margaret
