Carradine Death Was Accidental

IMDb, June=

David Carradine died during a sex game that went wrong, according=
 to sources in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was found dead on Thursday.

Car=
radine's body was discovered in a hotel suite and local reports suggested h=

He was discovered by a maid, naked and hanged, but t=
he suggestions his death had a sexual twist were strongly disputed by the s=
tar's close friend, attorney Vicki Roberts, and his manager Chuck Binder, w=
ho insisted he died of natural causes. 

But a statement from Carradine's r=
epresentative now indicates the actor died during a sex act.

The spokesper=
son tells TMZ.com, "We can confirm 100 percent that he never would have com=
mitted suicide. It was an accidental death. Everybody is in shock." 

Rumou=
rs Carradine died attempting auto-erotic asphyxiation- -where victims achie=

 by a quote a Bangkok police officer gave to British newspaper The Sun. 

T=
he cop tells reporters, "A rope was attached to his neck and also to his pe=

Rocker Michael Hutchence was rumoured to have died attempting the s=
ame sex act in a Sydney, Australia, hotel room back in 1997--although his d=
eath was officially declared a suicide.

Carradine was in Thailand to shoot=
 the movie "Stretch." He was 72.
