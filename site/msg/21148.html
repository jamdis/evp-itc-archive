<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have watched this field being taken over by the ghost hunter mentality
for years, the focus being on the negative, the frightening,  the evil, and
horror, while real spirit communication is completely ignored in favor of
making a name for ones self. Now the fad is demon hunting! That is so far
over the top I won&#x27;t even play anymore, y&#x27;all can have it.

 No, I don&#x27;t own the group, I gave it up years ago after another stupid
arguement, all my posts and e-mails got sent ot my boss and I almost got
fired. Everything I say about box use is completely ignored, all anyone
wants is to run around the dark playing ghost busters. With rare exceptions.
Even those that actually try to use the box for communuications seem to have
an agenda.

 This stuff goes on weekly, it&#x27;s just enough.
