<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Like Zack said, nobody knows for sure.  The only thing that we do know is
that there is a correlation between spikes in EMF&#x27;s and paranormal events.
 I have used various meters during GB sessions and there is a correlation at
times, but this has to be discounted solely because a radio uses part of the
EMF spectrum.

It is theorized that EMF measurements are to be taken solely in DC current
because it is natural electricity.  So any EMF meter you have that measures
AC is worthless on an investigation because it picks up man made
electricity.  As for the range, well that is also speculative at best.  The
most current theories hold that under 30 Hz DC is where you will find the
most paranormal activity.  This is because the Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta
brainwaves of a human are all below 30 Hz.  This is where the Body Electric
fires and consciousness is formed.  If we are dealing with a continuation of
consciousness, results are more apt to be found in this range.
 Interestingly enough, the earth vibrates in this same range with 5 standing
waves at or below 33Hz (Shuman Resonance), so it appears that the new agers
are right when they say we vibrate with the Earth.

But, as always, no one knows for sure.  And no one knows if these
frequencies have anything to do with what we receive in GBC.

&gt; This has probably already been discussed a hundred times over by people
&gt; building ghost boxes, but... what&#x27;s the average emf range of ghosts... and
&gt; would creating sounds in that emf range make it easier for the ghosts to
&gt; communicate? And would it be possible to make those sounds heard somehow?
