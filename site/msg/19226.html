<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks! The problem I have with the Jesus stuff is that everyone, without exception, that I know, that claimed to be born again will throw friends and family under the bus for the slightest personal gain. If this Jesus stuff was real, and who everyone thought it was, that wouldn&#x27;t happen--where people are turned to the darkside. The preachers wouldn&#x27;t be out chasing little boys, there is a pattern, and ya have to have the honesty to look at it. Ya don&#x27;t give yourself to any entity, I don&#x27;t care who they claim to be, it&#x27;s a trick. 

 F-S
