<div> It's probably not kosher to post=
 this, but I find this highly insulting to all of us. As usual, ignore all =
facts and all other methods, such as EVPmaker, which forms all the voices i=
nside the computer. Ignore all phone EVP messages, ignore all voices h=
eard with no electronic aids. Ignore messages received via turned off TV an=
d printers--and on and on, yet they know all about EVP..Ignore the fact tha=
t probably thousands use boxes successfully.</div>

<=
div>"We have conducted a few listening studies of reported radio-sweep EVP =
and the results have not been good. We have also worked with a variety of s=
uch devices. Based on what we know about trans-etheric influences, how EVP =
and visual forms of ITC are formed and what we know about mediumship, it is=
 difficult to fit radio-sweep into any established hypothesis. Without soli=
d research supporting it as producing EVP, it is impossible for us to recom=
mend it or support its use. If there were double-blind studies conducted by=
 experienced researchers that shows it does produce phenomena, we would gla=
dly promote it as an alternative technique.<br>
  <br>
We are pretty s=
ure that, in transform EVP (ordinary recorder), the voice is formed in the =
electronics by transforming available audio-frequency noise in an active pa=
rt of the electronics such as a transistor junction. We think the process i=
s amplification of a weak telekinetic signal via stochastic resonance and w=
e have found that the optimum audio-frequency signal for this is a chaotic =
one rich in voice-frequencies with many transient perturbation. That is our=
 working hypothesis. "</div>

<div> I can't say =
who this is from, cuz almost certain I'd get sued. There's no double blind =
testing their BS either. Clueless!!</div>

 it all,,"I wrote a book and im an expert" or "believe me that wont work, I=
