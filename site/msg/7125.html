<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rob .. I like your telephone idea!  I just started 
doing &quot;RadioSweep&quot; Conference Calls ... I&#x27;m recording with others via 
a &quot;Conference call recording room&quot; and it is allowing a group of 
people at a time test out my &quot;MiniBox&quot; and &quot;SuperBox&quot; through the 
telephone.  I&#x27;m hoping this will allow longer messages from our loved 
ones in Heaven!

&gt; I think your right sir:
&gt; 
&gt; I have found a way to make a box that everyone can use, and I may 
just
&gt; do it now!  I have a way to put a box on a telephone line and set it
&gt; up so it can be operated by the phones DTMF tones.  You can power it
&gt; on and off, control vol, scan rate, band, ect.  I could have it all
&gt; recorded and then emailed to the caller.  If I made it open to 
anybody
&gt; with a phone it might be &quot;less&quot; of an ego trip for the people 
involved
&gt; in this.  I would like to hear your thoughts on this idea.
&gt; Rob.

&gt; &gt; Hi All;
&gt; &gt;  I&#x27;m wondering why some many that do this &quot;reseach&quot; go mash 
potatoes
&gt; in the head, developing what seems to be that messiah complex. Box
&gt; user after box user seems to go down this road. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s
&gt; just human ego, or they get possessed, or what. Maybe it&#x27;s blinded 
by
&gt; dollar signs!? Maybe it&#x27;s like the Brookings Report, people just can
&gt; not handle the truth on a psychological/ego level. I think that 
report
&gt; applies to all encounters with  the vastness of the universe. 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  I can&#x27;t provide boxes for anyone else until I figure this stuff
&gt; out. It&#x27;s not ethical to give people something that has the 
potential
&gt; of fucking them up, to be blunt. I wanted to give these boxes out to
&gt; see how it worked for others, to see if they got something like I 
did,
&gt; and so far it&#x27;s very disappointing. It&#x27;s almost like an experiment 
on
&gt; people, except most were pretty much begging for, and demanding the
&gt; things. Even if it&#x27;s not the boxes per se`, that&#x27;s even more reason 
to
&gt; avoid the situation.
