<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I had a call left on my cell phones answering machine. From nobody or no number said which is weird in itself because it always says what number called at the start of voice messages or will say if its unlisted/blocked. I posted some results from that on my esnips.

At first I thought somebody sat on thier phone and didnt know it dialed me but only a couple people had that phone number because I dont use my cell much. The recording went on and on and I used alot of my minutes just listening trying to make out who it was that had called. the more I listened the more I realized there were a few voices and evp on there so I transferred it to my pc and analyzed it.
