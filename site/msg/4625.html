<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ursula and EVP-ITC community,

I&#x27;m new to this group and read with great interest the experiments 
that you&#x27;ve all been involved in.  I agree totally that the 
individual&#x27;s heart and mind are the most important tools in the 
capturing of EVPs and/or communicating with other dimensions in that 
from my limited personal experience and the observation of others in 
this field, I believe the messenger is just as important as the 
message being conveyed.  In other words, I&#x27;ve observed that in most 
cases, especially in those cases where a group of people are at a 
supposedly haunted locale trying to capture EVP with DVRs, that 
either only one person receives a message to a question or the 
messages received by everyone in the group is different.  This leads 
me to believe that the individual is just as an important a 
channel/receiver as the equipment being employed.  Therefore, I feel 
one must endeavor in one&#x27;s personal life to strive towards all things 
positive as the laws of attraction apply in that you&#x27;ll get back what 
you put out (to put in crudely).

Yay, today I&#x27;m trekking to Radio Shack through the cold and rain here 
in San Francisco (I know, we Californians are spoiled; we shiver at 
40 degrees and turn to ice at anything under 35 degrees), to get some 
equipment and spend New Year&#x27;s making my first box (thanks to Mike 
C.&#x27;s video, and to Frank S. for pointing me in the right direction)!  

Happy New Year to all,
Sharon

&gt; Robin,
&gt;   Glad something helped.  
&gt;   Beyond my thoughts, I totally agree that the choice of equipment 
is part of the ritual, and that having respect and passion for the 
process of choosing can actually add to the positive vibrations. 
Although, as previously stated, I believe with Mark Macy that the 
mind and heart are the most important tools in all this, how touched 
those on the other side must be to witness our fervent and abundant 
exchanges as we try to hash out the details of our equipment trials!  
Surely this heightens the love on their end--and their efforts to 
give us the contacts we desire. Something to think about.
&gt;   Best to all,
&gt;   Ursula

&gt;           Wow, thanks for your help guys!
&gt; 
&gt; Ursula, your post was lovely. I&#x27;ve been promising myself to learn 
&gt; more about Mark Macy&#x27;s work and will check out his website ASAP. 
&gt; Ritualized versus random recording makes sense to me now, as I want 
&gt; to accomplish true communication rather than continue being 
verbally 
&gt; abused. Have you given up &quot;ghost hunting&quot; altogether? 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ve been looking at the Olympus VN-4100 PC, Zack! I don&#x27;t know if 
I 
&gt; need that much recording time, but I sure have liked the one I have 
&gt; and wouldn&#x27;t mind upgrading a bit. 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Frank! I basically follow your suggestion when recording, and 
once 
&gt; I learned to be quiet I actually started getting responses. I think 
&gt; the entities at my house got tired of playing with me though, and 
now 
&gt; they aren&#x27;t saying anything. I kind of miss them, but I do feel 
it&#x27;s 
&gt; time to move on.

&gt; &gt; Hi Robin,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Radio Shack now carries the Olympus VN-4100PC at about the same 
&gt; price I 
&gt; &gt; paid for my VN-960PC a couple years ago. I&#x27;ve been very happy 
with 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; 960. The 4100 has about 4 times the recording time, I think. That 
&gt; would 
&gt; &gt; make it about 24 hours.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m new to the group but probably know some of you from another
&gt; &gt; &gt; list. I haven&#x27;t been too active in the realm of EVP recording
&gt; &gt; &gt; recently, but have had what I consider excellent results in the 
&gt; past
&gt; &gt; &gt; using my little refurbished Ebay-bargain Olympus VN-120 PC.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m anxious to start recording again and am feeling pretty
&gt; &gt; &gt; overwhelmed by the technology you all seem to be using. I know a
&gt; &gt; &gt; little about using good headphones and denoiser programs, but 
&gt; beyond
&gt; &gt; &gt; that I&#x27;m electronically challenged. Still, I wonder if there are
&gt; &gt; &gt; simple techniques I can experiment with to increase my success. 
I
&gt; &gt; &gt; think I&#x27;m a little bored.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve felt pretty strongly that I&#x27;ve been communicating with a 
very
&gt; &gt; &gt; small number of entities, and I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s due to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; limitations of my equipment. My most impressive EVPs have 
always 
&gt; been
&gt; &gt; &gt; captured around my own home, particularly outside on the hill 
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; near the barn. I&#x27;ve gotten two inside my house (after inviting
&gt; &gt; &gt; spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been negative 
&gt; messages.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#x27;m thinking about getting another DVR and would love 
to 
&gt; hear
&gt; &gt; &gt; your thoughts and recommendations about which ones are best. I 
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; like to communicate with more advanced entities eventually, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunately don&#x27;t have the brain for building anything myself.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Robin
