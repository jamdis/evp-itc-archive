<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I get frustrated because it seems impossible to get the concept across that one does not have to go to the latest haunted hot spot, most of those are fake, and pure suggestion. The entities speak with the lights on, there are no portals, the spirit don&#x27;t invade your house, you can use boxes duing the day. 

 How much mold do you think you are inhaling at these old abandoned buildings, what about lead paint, how many bums have gone over in the corner and taken a dump? How &#x27;bout animal crap, rat and mouse droppings? Then ya want to walk around in the dark in these places--yeah, pass! 

 I do all my recordings either in the house, or in the garage, lights on, no freaking problems, no portals, no demons tugging at my bed at night--nothing!!!! Yet everyone wants to believe the TV shit and think it&#x27;s all scray demon crap. 

 Most seem to have no interest in real spirit communcation, they only want the fear rush. Turn off the lights==fear, go to grave yard=fear, doing protection prayers==fear. 

 Yeah, might as well tell it to my dogs!
