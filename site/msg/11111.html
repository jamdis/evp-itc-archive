Just make sure he doesn't start sliding his foot or hand under the stall 
wall :-)

Sounds good.

  <p>Hi everyone New and Old ( meaning been here awhile LOL not age ),<br>

It's me Ralph the Ghost Hunter again. I see things have changed since <br>
I been away. Seems more civilized and that's a good thing. Well juat <br>
wanted to tell you all about some EVP's I got at my place of work. It <br>
seems we have a portal to Hell or something in our men's room LOL. I <br>
have gotten quite a few EVP's(Tradional) in the men's room. This past <br>
few days I got a couple of interesting ones. I was on break from work <br>
so I took my DR60 digital recorder and decided to check the room for <br>
any spirits. I was in the stall(lol) asking if there were any spirits <br>
there with me, when I looked at my recorder and didn't see it pick up <br>
anything(have it on VOR activation)so I decided to go to the sink area.<br>
I start asking if there are any spirits here with me and I said Is <br>
anyone here? I saw that the recorder was picking up sound. So I played <br>
it back and I heard someone say ( mind you I was all alone )" Here <br>
comes Lucifer" then after I asked " Is anyone here ? " A weird voice <br>
says " There are all kinds of Spirits ... here (here is kind of hard <br>
to hear)." So I'm thinking if the first voice said " Here comes <br>
Lucifer " the second voice might have been "Lucifer" himself saying of <br>
all the Spirits there. It's a creepy EVP to say the least. So what do <br>
you think could it have been Lucifer and could I be picking up a <br>
straight line to Hell or what ? Just something to think about. I got <br>
goose Bumps just thinking about it. Well anyways that's what went on. <br>
I hope you people are all doing okay. I also think I have taken a <br>
picture of a shadow person down in Gettysburg in the Triangular Field <br>
this past Nov. I'm still studying it. Hey it's nice to see everyone <br>
getting along that's great. You all take care and I will let you know <br>
of what other things I get in my search for the Paranormal. Have a <br>
great day all.<br>
