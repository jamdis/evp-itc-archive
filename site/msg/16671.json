The sound comes out the open ends.  That inspired me to install my own multi component layout in a similar pipe I had and use it also for a resonator. (the white pipe looks better painted black)  I cut the slots with a drill and dremmel tool.\n&gt; \n&gt; My results speak for themselves (see my photo)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  I think this might be a solution to expensive cases.
