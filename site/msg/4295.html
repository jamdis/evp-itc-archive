<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ann,

I&#x27;m happy for your happy news!  Looks like more and more people are 
taking possession of the many different boxes now available.  I look 
forward to reading about your adventures with your new Mini Box.
Looking at their website, it appears the box already might have the 
jack you&#x27;re asking about.  The box has three connectors on the front, 
(Mic, Recorder, and Speaker)  Looks like the output is already tapped 
off in two places, one for the speaker and one for the recorder.  I&#x27;m 
guessing the mic jack is so you can interface for a session, etc.

Let us know how your works...

- Mike

&gt; Is the speaker all I need or any kind of jack? For it?
&gt; 
&gt; Steve, will also ask Lisa if she&#x27;s aware of the &quot;technician&quot; who 
will  
&gt; hopefully be assisting me? I just want to get confirmation or  
&gt; rejection of what I seem to be sensing.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Ann,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I went to radio shack and bought a speaker model #21-549 and it 
seems
&gt; &gt; to work fine. I got mine yesterday and didn&#x27;t seem to thrilled 
about
&gt; &gt; the results and gave another try tonight. Tonight, i spoke to 
several
&gt; &gt; different people in their own voices and really have to give 
credit to
&gt; &gt; Mike and Lisa for making this communication keep getting better. 
This
&gt; &gt; really is another valuable box in my research, as long as 
different
&gt; &gt; designs become available i will test them all. Every box is unique
&gt; &gt; and offers different results, but they all work off the same 
premise
&gt; &gt; of raw audio bits. Real time communication is finally here and 
gets
&gt; &gt; better every day, some day&#x27;s frank&#x27;s box is better and than some 
day&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; RS box...etc. Depends on your surroundings, your mood, the weather
&gt; &gt; but all these devices have worked for me up to this point and i&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; grateful.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; p.s.--here is the link to the speaker so you can get a visual.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Your going to love this wild ride and watching new people get 
involved
&gt; &gt; and posted results makes it all worth it for me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I just got my notice. I think I may faint from excitement.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey, fellow list dwellers who have one--what extra equipment to 
I
&gt; &gt; &gt; need to have to make this function (speakers, but not computer
&gt; &gt; &gt; speakers)? Anything else I can go out an get now? I am truly, 
truly
&gt; &gt; &gt; technology challenged, so guidance addressed to one like a 
toddler
&gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; what I need.
