I am asking most respectfully. There is so much contention, outright animosity and name calling the topic goes from being about the EVP&#39;s to personal attacks on such a regular basis there is almost no space for what this group is truly about. The negative energies are too much for me. \n&gt;  \n&gt; I truly hope, Frank, you get the support you need and deserve to further your research. I see how passionate you are about this and my wish for you is one day you won&#39;t need to prove to others how exactly correct you are about the voices of those speaking from the other side. I know they are speaking. I have many EVP&#39;s that have been proven correct. They are clear and concise. Mine were from using a voice recorder. Frank, I believe you.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I won&#39;t argue and beleaguer the point. No, it is not from a place of &quot; oh you just can&#39;t stand up under scrutiny,&quot; it is from the place of all of this sidetracking and negativity is useless. I have no need to prove myself or the recordings. The families for whom they were done proved it. Clear voices. Clear messages. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Some individuals feel the need to argue everything endlessly due to the need to feel superior and always right. Some individuals do it due to a lack of self esteem and they feel superior when putting others down, making rude challenges, pushing the envelope and manipulating a situation to appear as superior when in fact they are not.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I need nor want none of this in my life and choose to be removed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take every chance you get because some things only happen once...\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 6/17/10, purplespacefriend &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: purplespacefriend &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Tesing-testing\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, June 17, 2010, 10:40 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  You keep repeating yourself, you keep ignoring all facts, you keep ingore what everyone here gets, and you keep implying all of us are somehow brain damaged, and you keep attacking me personally, making this all about &quot;my cult&quot;,  and you keep repeating yourself,  saying the same thing over and over, ignoring all facts, and implying we are all idiots that don&#39;t bow down to your superior intellect. \n&gt;  Sciecne, science, science--so since when is science all about ignoring all facts and making the results fit preconcieved notions.  That means ideal science, not the bought and paid crap in this country where you an pay science to get any result you want.  The science where first you decide what is true, then beat everyone to death that doesn&#39;t buy into it, and that&#39;s not cultish. \n&gt; &quot;she blinded me with science!&quot; \n&gt; F-S\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Lizzie Broden &lt;yahuli69@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You can never defend one point by leaping to another or trying to change theÂ subject.
