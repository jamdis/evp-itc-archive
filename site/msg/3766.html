To allow them to sync with you while recording. Leave a watch ro cl=

 I appreciate the advice, Frank. 



I'll do so, at least initially. Perhap=
s it's so some sort of lock-on 

with those on the otherside can be establi=
shed. From my ITC reading, 

there is something of a challange to ITC due t=
o unsynchronized 

difference of time and space between hither and yon.

Perhaps leaving a Box on and running in one location improves the 

chance=
s by allow those using their tech on the otherside to establish 

a better =
connection.



For some silly reason I was just reminded of a scene from an=
 old 

classic, The Time Tunnel. I visualized again those white coated 

sc=
ientists in the control room, using the big machine to scan across 

the va=
stness, trying to get a stable lock on Doug and Tony... lost in 

time!
