I am interested in creating a Franks Box from the radio shack radio. (I&#39;m not mechanically inclined) I apologize but I couldn&#39;t find the directions anywhere. Can someone point me in the right direction to create my own ghost box? \nI am also interested in the quality of sound some of you may have gotten with digital tape recorder EVPs.  I got one that happened when I left the recorder in my living room and left. It sounded like the voice was spinning around the room (kind of like Carol Ann in Poltergiest) and it said &quot;Door is open&quot;  Is it odd to hear a voice that sounds like it is spinning as it speaks?\nThanks &#39;\nAngelina \nAtlanta"}
