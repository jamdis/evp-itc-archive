At least now I know \nwhat to look for, thanks to you.  How embarassing...oh well, have to \nask if I&#39;m gonna learn and get it all together correctly. \nthanks again for your help.\nLaura\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Laura.  I use Audacity to record box/radio sweep sessions, but I \nfind that using it for \n&gt; &#39;traditional&#39; EVP purposes hasn&#39;t worked for me.  When I do \ntraditional EVP sessions, I use \n&gt; any of my digital recorders (which is where the EVP seem to be \nformed best, not when \n&gt; using the computer) then play the file from my recorder into my \ncomputer, so I can better \n&gt; review the content of the session as well as edit, save, share, \netc.  So yes, you still need a \n&gt; patch cable.  :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; I think the confusion may have been when you told them at Radio \nShack that you wanted \n&gt; to connect your mic of the recorder to the mic of your computer??  \nWhat you want to do is \n&gt; connect the EAR/HEADPHONE to the computer.  So, instead of \nlistening through the \n&gt; speaker of the recorder, or plugging in headphones and listening \nwith your ears, you are \n&gt; going to play the file and let your computer hear it through the \ncable.  Hope that makes \n&gt; sense.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just press the record button on Audacity, then press the play \nbutton on your recorder, and \n&gt; it will start recording in the computer.  Then save your session.  \nAfter that you can edit, \n&gt; isolate areas, export WAV files, etc.  If you want to be able to \nexport MP3 format, you have \n&gt; to download/install the LAME add-on for Audacity.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret"}
