Frank, what you are doing with the boxes is interesting. I think the=
 draw to the box for ghost hunters is that it "appears" to be a communicati=
on device with the dead. I've been experimenting a lot with the radio shack=
 hack box and I have been getting a lot. For the most part I am using it to=
 get answers to questions I or others have in areas that have had strange e=
vents or just a paranormal nature to them. There is definitely communicatio=
n at a rudimentary level although I doubt that all of it is=A0honest commun=
ication. I definitely see a lot of the trickster influence with these boxes=
. It can and does tell people what they want to hear, and it seems to be re=
ading the minds of the participants. Like someone will crack a joke and the=
 box will respond 2 seconds later saying simply "joke". I was using the box=
 in one area with a recently married woman and the word pregnant came=A0out=
 of the box=A03 times during the 2 sessions. I think the box was picking up=
 on
 her conscious or subconscious thoughts. I have not gotten the word pre=
gnant since then. 
=A0
So far both radio shack types I have are working spe=
ctacularly for me. One of the more interesting responses I've gotten out of=
 the box is that it has said "ovulous" backwards (it said "75" forwards), a=
nd that was just 10 minutes or so after I was playing around with the Ovilu=
s. I don't know exactly how The Ovilus is supposed to be pronounced but the=
 box pronounced it like I spelled it above.
=A0
So what is going on with th=
ese boxes is extremely interesting and not readily explainable by science, =
but I lean away from thinking the communications are coming from ghosts or =
