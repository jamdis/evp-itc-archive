I brought Chip Coffey up to show him #34, and wihtout \nasking \n&gt; questions, the box told Chip, &quot;you have to have this!&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I&#39;ll ask questions, but it&#39;s rare, I prefer to just let them speak. \n&gt; \n&gt;  I was just trying to impress people that they know who you are, when \n&gt; you&#39;re recording, and what you&#39;re thinking--there&#39;s no limits.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
