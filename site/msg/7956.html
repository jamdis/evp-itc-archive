Ok guys you are back at it again. In the files section make one folder with your name on it and post all your files in that. I am about to start deleting stuff that isnt being filed properly. If you have two folders you just need to move your files over into one. You can make subfolders in that if needed. If your files are scattered all over the place then either organize them or they may get deleted. Theres alot of people in this group so please keep that in mind when you post that your "share" of the space on group is limited and needs organization. If you need more space you can use esnips.com to share files with this group.
