<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank,

That&#x27;s great you were able to make it there on Sunday.  Here is the 
agenda they posted on the event website. It lists you and I along 
with Bill Murphy with the group on Monday and Tuesday night from 10pm-
2am.:

----
10pm - 2am
We will assemble into two groups: Group 1 Investigates with the 
celebrities. Everyone will have a chance to work with the 
celebrities. Group 2 will meet in the Pinion Billiards room. Mike 
Coletta, Bill Murphy and Frank Sumption will present new looks at 
upcoming paranormal technology. Live experimentation with new 
devices. This presentation will be followed up with a preview of The 
Stanley Effect Documentary and Q&amp;A. 
----

- Mike

&gt; &gt; Hi Allen,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Looks like plans have changed and I won&#x27;t be at the Stanley Hotel 
&gt; &gt; paranormal event after all.  There was some sort of disconnect 
and 
&gt; my 
&gt; &gt; name didn&#x27;t show up on the guest list, so they couldn&#x27;t give me a 
&gt; &gt; room there. That&#x27;s what the hotel supervisor said last night 
&gt; &gt; anyway... and it&#x27;s too late in the game to follow this up.
&gt; &gt; He did say about 245 people will be in attendance, so you should 
&gt; have 
&gt; &gt; a good time.
&gt; &gt; Frank Sumption and I were both on their speaking agenda to talk 
&gt; and 
&gt; &gt; use some new devices for half the group at a time, but I heard 
&gt; Frank 
&gt; &gt; might not be able to make it either.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I hope to meet you and April at a future event sometime...
&gt; &gt;
