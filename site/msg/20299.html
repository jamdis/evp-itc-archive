<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t wanna beat up mainstream science for these few skepdorks, I really
doubt they represent anything, any university, or most science
professionals. I think they are just nasty little people that think cutting
down others is the only way they can make a name for themselves. You can
tell by the way that they present little, if any opposing &quot;data&quot;, instead
they take the stage to cuss and call us names. That&#x27;s ain&#x27;t science, it
ain&#x27;t anything but ingnorant duffuses trying to grab attention.

&gt;&gt; My 2 cents is that it&#x27;s MUCH easier to shoot down an idea as being useless
&gt;&gt; than it is to prove that it may have some merit.
&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s just less work to be a know-it-all that debunks everything, than it
&gt;&gt; is to actually prove the vearcity of some phenomenon.
&gt;&gt; They all laughed at Chris Columbus!!!!!!!!!!!!
&gt;&gt; Copernicus
&gt;&gt; Galileo
&gt;&gt; Einstein
&gt;&gt; etc. etc. etc.
&gt;&gt; A lot of people with great ideas were chortled at in their lifetimes.
&gt;&gt; No amount of proof will EVER convince someone who firmly believes, or
&gt;&gt; doesn&#x27;t believe, in something.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I think these skeptics purpose is to keep main stream science from
&gt;&gt; looking
&gt;&gt; &gt; at certain taboo subjects, almost like a religion trying to keep itself
&gt;&gt; &gt; pure. It aslmost has to be the universities that fund these people,
&gt;&gt; &gt; otehrwise why would they waste their time, unless they are so lame this
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt; the only way they can make a name for themselves. Science in this
&gt;&gt; country is
&gt;&gt; &gt; mostly out dated dogma that they pass off a absolute irrefutable gospel
&gt;&gt; &gt; truth that must not be questioned, as if all is known, and all has been
&gt;&gt; &gt; discovered.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought true skeptics were supposed to be logical, open-minded
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; people who have doubts until they&#x27;re presented with evidence that
&gt;&gt; would
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; dispel such doubts. She&#x27;s not a skeptic but a blind, fanatical
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; non-believer. That&#x27;s too bad.
