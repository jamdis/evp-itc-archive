&gt;       Hiya, Bill, Been trying to find out where you are (Frank said 
&gt; you&#x27;re near me)! I&#x27;m In Mar Vista near Venice Beach . . not far 
&gt; from &quot;HollyWeird&quot;! LOL.   Would love to be present durring one of 
&gt; your sessions! I&#x27;m SOOoooo interested in this subject! I&#x27;ve gotten a 
&gt; few EVP&#x27;S from my portable Sony cassette tape recorder with external 
&gt; mic - at The Hillcrest Cemetary, near me! It really surprized me - 
&gt; when I heard them!!    
&gt; =Judy=                                                                
&gt;                                                                      -

&gt; &gt; Judy, I&#x27;m near Hollywood and I work with a small group of like 
&gt; minded
&gt; &gt; researchers. We have a Frank&#x27;s Box and you&#x27;ll never, ever have to 
&gt; even
&gt; &gt; think we would ask for anything from you to participate in a Box
&gt; &gt; session. -Bill

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I started the research with a box i was lucky to have made 
&gt; based 
&gt; &gt; &gt; off 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Frank&#x27;s idea.  As all on this board one way or another would 
&gt; &gt; &gt; have 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done anything to get their hands on one of Frank&#x27;s boxes or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something equivalent.  So, now it&#x27;s your chance to get another 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; version of an already great idea and everyone&#x27;s complaining.  
&gt; Isn&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this the answer to everyone&#x27;s problem, it may be pricey but i 
&gt; know 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people who would have paid more in the past for a similar 
&gt; item.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This board is for research, this is just another idea just like 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Joe&#x27;s idea of joe&#x27;s box and frank&#x27;s &quot;frank&#x27;s box&quot;.  If this 
&gt; version 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#x27;t work, than the idea will kill itself.  But, now people 
&gt; can 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get to see if they are truly meant to work with the other side 
&gt; or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one of the 30 or 80 or whatever the number is up to now.  I 
&gt; think 
&gt; &gt; &gt; if 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you don&#x27;t like this minibox than don&#x27;t buy it, but isn&#x27;t 
&gt; anybody 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; curious to see the results people get with it or don&#x27;t.  Just 
&gt; my 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take on it, i think it&#x27;s crazy that everyone is getting so 
&gt; upset 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about another form of communication.  It took me back at first 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because i felt this would kill my research, but we don&#x27;t know 
&gt; if 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this even works yet.  These things happen for a reason by stuff 
&gt; out 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of our control.  All we can do is sit back and watch, and who 
&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think someone was going to mass produce this idea eventually 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyway?

&gt; &gt; &gt;       Hi Steve H., My thoughts are if the boxes DO work well for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; those that are truely interested in doing research with them - 
&gt; &gt; &gt; daily!! I&#x27;d still like to experience one, but am in L.A. - where 
&gt; no 
&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#x27;s doing Public demos of it = UGH! Chris -who was in San diego 
&gt; &gt; &gt; today wants $125. for the admission!! Yikes!     =Judy=
