<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s awesome, Jeremy.  I have some EVP of a woman talking to my dog.  One time when I 
was recording, my dog (Kindred) started barking.  When I listened back to the session (this 
was tradition EVP done in silence with a digital recorder) she had said, &quot;Kindred.  What was 
that?&quot;  

In another, Kindred barks, then the woman says, &quot;Kindred.  She thinks you&#x27;re sleeping.&quot;  I 
also have one of someone telling her &quot;NO&quot; and I really like the one where someone tattles 
on her to me, &quot;Kindred&#x27;s headed for the dumpster.&quot;  LOL.  Just goes to show you they are 
not only keeping an eye on us, but the animals too.  I think it&#x27;s great that sometimes they 
are talking directly to the dog.  

I only have one involving my cat, Kizmyt, where someone says, &quot;Stay back&quot; (the cat had 
come into the room as I was recording).

I have gotten many ITC images of animals, so clearly they are an important part of the 
spirit realm.  :-)  As well, I had animals come through during sitting with a medium.

Thanks for sharing about your Molly EVP!  It made me smile.

&gt; Hello Again Margaret,
&gt; 
&gt; I forgot to tell you this earlier. Since you are also a dog owner I
&gt; know you will appreciate this.
&gt; 
&gt; The day before yesterday I received an EVP. Male Voice.
&gt; 
&gt; He takes what sounds like a breath and says...Pooch. :)
&gt; 
&gt; I, of course always have Molly, my Jack Russell Terrier by my side
&gt; when I record.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I guess I have a Spirit Friend that loves animals too. 
&gt; 
&gt; Grin.
&gt; 
&gt; Take care.
&gt; 
&gt; Many Blessings All,
&gt;
