<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It doesn&#x27;t piss me off, and I don&#x27;t mind giving away the proto types, it&#x27;s 
annoying to me only in that I have not yet gotten any production going, (I 
keep getting sidetracked). Some of these hand wire boxes don&#x27;t seem to hold 
up, especially if they are shipped, and moved all over the place. The hand 
wired boxes are quite inferior to ones I could make with printed circuit 
boards, I just haven&#x27;t had the time to do the board layout yet. There&#x27;s also 
the problem that I keep finding better ways to improve the boxes, like the 
tiny echo box. I hate to provide stuff that seems less than completed, in 
that way.

&gt;I personally think begging for a box from Frank is probably just
&gt;pissing him off.  He will give a box to whom he feels is doing
&gt;research on their own and deserves one being they already have a
&gt;clientel on the other side without his help.  This is just my
&gt;opinion and i really don&#x27;t mean to offend people, but everybody can
&gt;try to say the right thing to persuade Frank, but he is looking for
&gt;true researchers in ITC and not someone who just wants to have what
&gt;nobody can make themself.  It&#x27;s just annoying seeing people everyday
&gt;saying where&#x27;s my box?  There is plenty of research to do without it
&gt;and capable people to build them too.  Find them and stop begging on
&gt;this board, this is not what it is for and i&#x27;m not speaking for
&gt;Frank in any way.  But i&#x27;d rather hear someone&#x27;s Manual sweeps or
&gt;something through EVP maker rather than groveling with no attempt to
&gt;do anything for themselves.  Just my take on it and i&#x27;m sorry if i
&gt;pissed anybody off.
