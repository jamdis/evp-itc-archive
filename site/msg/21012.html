Here's a few more, on that one part where they talk about Jerusalem, they  
are referring to the "coffins being those in hell"  buried in the way of  
the doors of the old city where JC is going to open the doors, he would need 
to  raise the dead there first in order to pass through into Old Jerusalem.   
It's an old saying, the Messiah cannot pass the dead in the valley between 
MT of  olives and the city wall until the dead are raised.  Most of these 
are  reverse type files too, I didn't have time to revere them, they have 
words in  sentences, on each side.  Most of the spirit's are talking to each 
other,  it seems they think you are ignoring them, they are saying that you 
won't talk  to them, and some are upset with you.
