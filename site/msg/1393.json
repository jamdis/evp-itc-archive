Yep...I&#39;ve \nlived on campus in both Urbana and Champaign. It&#39;s been years since \nI&#39;ve been back (actually - not since I graduated in \n1980...lol...THAT dates me!). I&#39;ve studied on and off for both my \ncommercial radio license and ham license but just never followed \nthrough on getting them - too many other things going on.\n\nBy the way - I was born and raised in Moline (the Quad Cities) but \nnow I&#39;m thoroughly &quot;embedded&quot; here in Southern California...no more \nice and freezing cold and snow for me!\n\nHave you downloaded and tried Stefan Bion&#39;s EVPMaker yet? As you \nknow from reading Frank&#39;s documentation - that&#39;s what he based \nthe &quot;Ghost Box&quot; on...\n\nAnyhow - welcome!\n\nGuy\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I just joined and I thought I&#39;d introduce myself.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am an electrical engineer, radio amateur and a ghost hunter \nliving in \n&gt; Urbana, IL. (Well, I like the term &quot;paranormal investigator&quot; \nbetter!)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve gotten a lot of EVP&#39;s on a pocket DVR but I found and \ndownloaded the \n&gt; schematics for Frank&#39;s ghost box some months ago.  I&#39;m fascinated \nby this \n&gt; idea and I hope I can find the time to build the equipmeont some \ntime \n&gt; soon. Hopefully I will get beyond the 70-80 hour work weeks I&#39;ve \nbeen \n&gt; putting in for the last couple months ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking forward to seeing what&#39;s happening on this group!\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt;"}
