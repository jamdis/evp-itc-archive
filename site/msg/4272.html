&gt; Frank,  
&gt;                You are very respected and your hard work and 
dedication reflects that.  What originally set out to satisfy your 
curiosity and flourished and developed paving the pathway for those 
who thirst the same knowledge as you.  You mentioned that the anyone 
off the street just may not decipher what we truly hear or the fact 
that we will not be able to convince those who are skeptics to change 
their minds, what I can tell you first hand is not true.
&gt;    
&gt;                 As you know pursuant to my private correspondence, 
that I work will authorities on missing and murdered children.  Since 
obtaining a RS hacked I have worked consistently everyday trying to 
build a relationship and further my research.  Through the guidance 
of many of this group  (especially Bruce and Steve) they have 
assisted me in obtaining details (which were confirmed by autopsy 
reports, and personal statement) as well as additional information in 
which law enforcement did not have.  These messages which have come 
through the form of spirit communication have not only helped in 
providing the authorities with leads to follow, but may just in fact 
assist in bringing the remains of a child home to their family for 
proper burial.  The fact the the law enforce officials have opened 
their minds that this type of communication is possible in itself, is 
a huge step.  Although the recorded message would not be used as any 
evidence in the cases, they still provide
&gt;  a direction in where to look to collect the evidence that is 
needed.  If we just help one of these families, just one, then all of 
the time, effort and dedication is worth it.
&gt;    
&gt;   If it was not for you and your curiosity none of this information 
would be out there.  You have touched so many peoples lives many that 
you will never even meet.  With the continual research of yourself 
and those in this group, you are making the difference and a positive 
impact not only here in the physical but also the other side.

&gt;            Well, when ya get someone giving seemingly valid reasons 
why these new methods are invalid, or questionable, then I turn on 
the RS hack rig, and &quot;they&quot; are singing &quot;Purple&quot; across the band, and 
then the scan starts again at the bottom of AM with &quot;DO NOT---QUIT----
GROUP&quot; (the --- indicate gaps with no broadcasts or voice fragments), 
I&#x27;m supposed to believe that&#x27;s just my imagination, that these things 
don&#x27;t work. The fact is all these methods work, and they have in fact 
been used long before the box. 
&gt;  
&gt;  This &quot;Researcher&quot; I was arguing with yesterday no doubt thought he 
had me convinced, and on his side. I can&#x27;t go there after I get 
clear, coherent, meaningful messages with these other methods. I 
would like to keep the disaggreements friendly, and the discussions 
friendly, and I do consider the opposing viewpoint, but it just 
doesn&#x27;t hold water in the case of these alternate radio methods. 
That&#x27;s why no interviews, and no in person meetings--as such, I can 
be put into a postion of sympathy with a person when I don&#x27;t actually 
agree. It&#x27;s called lack of assertiveness, and I did in fact fail 
assertiveness training in the community college! As soon as the 
meeting is over though, I&#x27;m going to tell ya to bite me, and do my 
own thing anyway. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I think we all have to be very careful when critisizing someone&#x27;s 
work here, research, or comments--in public. So far very little of 
the EVP stuff can be considered hard evidence, it&#x27;s all what they 
call anecdotal, or it&#x27;s what one or more witnesses experienced, but 
it&#x27;s not repeatable--pretty much. Or you can&#x27;t grab someone off the 
street, have them listen to voices and expect they&#x27;ll hear it. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I can&#x27;t say my results are anymore valid than anyone else&#x27;s&#x27; but I 
also can&#x27;t accpet that anyone else&#x27;s results are more valid than my 
own. I am an independent researcher, I do this work on my own, it&#x27;s 
more like just a hobby. I don&#x27;t sell anything, and I make nothing by 
endorsing other products. When I say the Mini Box works, and the 
Radio Shack hack works, that is the honest thing to do, it&#x27;s not cuz 
I get a kick back, as I get nothing in return, except to know I did 
the right thing. 
&gt;  
&gt;  As for this other &quot;Researcher&quot;, I don&#x27;t know what to tell ya. I 
can only ask, give us some friggin&#x27; credit! There&#x27;s some good peole 
here, and to dismiss us, and all or our results is extremely 
insulting.
&gt;  
&gt;  As for the possiblities of danger with this research, I&#x27;ve been 
thinking about that. First I don&#x27;t know of anyone else that has had 
any problems directly related to box use, and or paranormal work fro 
that matter.  It&#x27;s like listening to some bible thumper swearing the 
devil is really right there, just waiting to jump down your throat, 
and yet, there&#x27;s..... nothing. So far it&#x27;s more threatening to cross 
the street every morning (I usually walk to work). 
&gt;  
&gt;  I pretty much work by myself, I like it that way, and sharing what 
I get here. I don&#x27;t wanna be TAPS, or any other thing. I don&#x27;t care 
who accepts my results, I do this for myself, for my own curiosity. 
I&#x27;m not going to accept someone else&#x27;s version of reality, and I 
trust my own intuition.
&gt;  
&gt;  I&#x27;m sorry if someone thought I implied this shit came from  
Edison, or anyone else. I don&#x27;t recall that. It&#x27;s more likely that 
someone suggested it was Edison&#x27;s concept, or whatever, and I kinda 
agreed it was like that for discussion--I don&#x27;t know.  I know how it 
came about in my own mind, as problems are often solved, your own 
subconcius mind will assemble an answer based on previous experience, 
and I had worked with voltage tunable radios in the mid 90&#x27;s, then I 
got interested in EVP, then I used EVPmaker, then my own mind 
connected all the dots, nothing mysterious, or other worldly about 
it. It&#x27;s that same process that takes place when you sleep on a 
problem, and wake up with a solution. I did not understand the 
process at first, but it&#x27;s very common.
