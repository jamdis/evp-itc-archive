<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Steve,

Most hauntings seem to be by troubled spirits, but don&#x27;t worry; I won&#x27;t tell your wife. ;o)

Wow, the Native American is a big one! I have a mirror that has a naughty non-human spirit in it. I&#x27;ve got him quieted down, and he&#x27;s been quiet for years now. But I know what you mean by having to kick some spirit butt. I didn&#x27;t want to cast it out so that I could study it.

&gt; Hi Draiga and thanks for the welcome !  
&gt; 
&gt; We particularly focus working with spirits who are troubled and I guess this place has become sort of &quot;doll rehab&quot; ( shhh don&#x27;t tell the wife I said that lol ) .. It&#x27;s not everyone who has a life size Native American doll in their family room but its created a great atmosphere over time with all the energies although we have had some challenging times with some of the naughtier ones on the way, had to kick some spirit butt on the way to keep those out... Thanks again 
&gt;
