When i came up \nwith the hack originally for this model it seemed simple enough.  I \nposted detailed instructions the best i could up on my site \nkeyportparanormal.com\n\nI&#39;m on the search today to try and find some other hackable radios at a \nflea market, i&#39;ll keep everyone posted.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nick&quot; &lt;thegreatwolf@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey. We&#39;re about ready to buy the newest RS hack radio (the 200-125). \nI was wondering if we \n&gt; needed to buy an ac adaptor for it.  It seems simple enough, but if i \nneed it i have access to \n&gt; crazy electronic people (the booth techies).  I saved the directions \nBruce and various other \n&gt; people posted.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; Peace,\n&gt; Nick\n&gt;"}
