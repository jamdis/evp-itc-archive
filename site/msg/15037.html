K...thanks to both you and RJ for clearing that up.

Well that still jives =
with my theories on true EVP as well. That they aren't sound waves emitted =
in the environment. They are purely electromagnetic, which is why we call t=
hem Electronic Voice Phenomena.

        Yes, because so=
undwaves by nature are measured through our environment. As RJ corrected an=
d reminded me they are pressure waves that are subject to the thickness of =
our atmosphere. Meaning they cannot be transmitted at th speed of light. Wh=
at they can do is be embedded in a carrier signal to be demodulated by the =
air and manifest back into physical sound.

   Sorry, RJ. I stand corrected! Soundwaves are not EM waves because they l=
ack the EM component and are subject to our physical environment. Hence, ca=

                  That being said, the=

                                No. Sounds wa=
ves are not on the electromagnet spectrum nor are they a form of electromag=
net energy. Sound waves are based on pressure waves in the air (or in other=
 substances).  Our ears detect these pressure waves and translate them into=
 sounds we here.  Our ear do NOT hear electromagnet energy.  Our eyes do: t=
hat part which we call visible light.

 mistake that a lot of people make is thinking that there are two different=
 types of energy at work when it comes to sound waves and electromagnetic w=
aves. The only thing that seperates them is frequency and power. Radio wave=
s are radio waves because they occupy a certain block of the electromagniet=
ic spectrum. Sound waves exist on that same spectrum just farther down with=
 much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic waves can penetrate almost anyt=
hing because of their wavelengths. The shorter the wavelength the more ways=
 we can shield against them.

                                Think of micr=
owaves. These are also a type of radio and telemetry transmitting wave but =
the waves also have a physical effect on our environment by causing molecul=
es to speed up, which creates heat. A little lower than this is IR or infra=
red it too can cause physical objects to heat up but usually it just causes=
 molecules to rotate in place. All physical things give off IR light. Its a=
 way the total system conserves energy by spontaneously emitting IR radiati=
on.

                                Here is some food for=
 thought. I am currently reviewing my audio from our May 30th investigation=
.

                                It was me and another girl teammate pres=
ent in the room. I picked up a 3rd female voice on my digital voice recorde=
r that I carry with me. We were standing right next to another digital vide=
o recorder that I leave beside my night vision camera. That recorder did no=
t pick up this 3rd voice. I have asked the girl that was with me to check h=
er recording to see if she picked it up.

                                I=
 have long felt the true EVP does not come from sound waves in the environm=
ent, or then it wouldn't be EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow EVP's are=
 appearing directly on the recordings.

                                Thi=
s instance with the recorders may back that theory up. That other recorder =
should have picked that voice up if it were sound waves in the environment.=


                                I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice=
. The file that is named "01-02-17 Clip" is the full clip. You will hear my=
 voice as I say "Yeah", and then another comes in right after that. I think=
 I know what it says.

                                Again, I was live mo=
nitoring my audio, but still did not hear this until playback. It isn't cle=
ar, so I am not as excited about it as my one's from the last investigation=
.

                                I have a running theory that =
EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they wan=
t it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ult=
rasonic waves that differ one another in frequency then if you add or subtr=
act them together you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For exam=
ple, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan i=
n a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a int=
ermediate difference frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20=
Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic equipment genera=
tes ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From this theory I always f=
elt that EVP were generated within a few inches of the recorder.

         =
                       We are able to reproduce this affect in not only rad=
io with superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and audio as in som=
e passive sonars and a commercial produce called the "audio spotlight" by D=
r. Joseph Pompeii.

ant it to manifest. It works off the 
                                heter=

       if you add or subtract them together you get a
