It also \npicks up stuff without playing the file through evpmaker and converts \nit into letters just by using the microphone on the computer.  I&#39;m \ngoing to try and figure this out later, you can also cancel out \ncertain frequencies too.  It&#39;s worth exploring into this a bit.  For \nthose who don&#39;t get what i&#39;m trying to do, i&#39;m running my frequency \nfile through evpmaker and it than sounds like morse code.  Than i&#39;m \nusing a program to try and convert the jumbled morse code sounding \nfile from evpmaker into coherent messages typed on the computer \nscreen.\n\n  \nThe program is called Cwget.  I grew up on Ham Radio, so this doesn&#39;t \nsound so far fetched for me.  But sorry if i&#39;m losing some people on \nthis method.\n\n73&#39;s\n-Steve H.\n\np.s.  The program was too large for yahoo, so here&#39;s a link:\n\nhttp://www.dxsoft.com/micwget.htm"}
