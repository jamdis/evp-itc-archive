In my book&lt;BR&gt;they all rank just a bit above lawyers but still below pro wrestling.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp; (Hows that for an introduction?&nbsp; :)&nbsp; )&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Larry&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: John S &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Saturday, February 14, 2009 9:44 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Door To The Dead&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have to admit that I thought I had seen the worst &#39;paranormal&#39;&lt;BR&gt;show on television already. I was wrong. Door to the Dead has exceeded&lt;BR&gt;my worst expectations.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n Generally, I respect John Oliver&#39;s work as a medium. While I have no&lt;BR&gt;personal experience with him, in the past he has looked and acted more&lt;BR&gt;genuine than not, the rolling of the eyes put aside for the moment.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I do take exception to the characterization of the talking box as an&lt;BR&gt;Edison device. I have documented the history of Edison, ITC and&lt;BR&gt;EVP&nbsp;&nbsp;elsewhere. This is however the smallest concern I have with this&lt;BR&gt;show.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Prior to wathcing I had just had a conversation with a respected&lt;BR&gt;colleague on the West coast regarding interesting phenomena he and&lt;BR&gt;others are constantly observing in sites with phenomena similar to&lt;BR&gt;that on Door to the Dead. None of those measurements were made by this&lt;BR&gt;team. The use of thermal in this situation is not indicated as well.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The real concern is that no attempt was made to help this family in&lt;BR&gt;a broader context. The skeptic did\n and said nothing skeptical as far&lt;BR&gt;as I could tell. Key questions were not asked (at least on-camera)&lt;BR&gt;that would reveal the psycho-dynamics of this family. We know fairly&lt;BR&gt;well at this time that PK phenomena is often centered on a focal&lt;BR&gt;person who can exhibit specific characteristics. That the team seems&lt;BR&gt;unaware of this is quite disturbing to a person like myself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; A real research opportunity was lost in this case, as was an&lt;BR&gt;opportunity to educate the public on the right way to approach such&lt;BR&gt;situations. Continually sending the messages that phenomena is based&lt;BR&gt;on &#39;demons&#39; and &#39;spirits&#39; exclusively does nothing to further the&lt;BR&gt;position of serious investigators, which is perhaps most troubling of all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-1833182744-1234788604=:18135--"}
