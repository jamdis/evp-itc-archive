 That's my point, he has no right or authority to tell the rest of the wor=
ld that all other boxes users get "false communcication". Since Moon alone =
hears that stuff about technicains, Edison, and portals, and no one else he=
ars it, I consider it suspect, at best. Others here have goten voices that =
mention both Tesla and Edison, but none run to public to announce the one a=
nd only, real contacts. Wiht no other validation, or information, getting t=
he name is meaningless. 
 
 I've never seen a portal, so how would one know=
 if a portal was somehwere if it can't be detected.
