Often peop=\r\nle get a childs voice and they become saddened by the thought that a child =\r\nis earthbound.

I k=\r\nnew my mother longer than anyone and \n            its interesting that it i=\r\ns easier for those people to believe that \n            its possible that so=\r\nmething/someone else is speaking pretending to \n            be my mother bu=\r\nt its much harder for them to believe that quite \n            possibly that=\r\n really is my mother keeping her promise to stay in \n            touch afte=\r\nr death. If one is possible then so is the other. I tend \n            to be=\r\n stubborn in some respects in that I dont instantly believe \n            wh=\r\nat anyone tells me whether living or not. If they give me a \n            me=\r\nssage I think is dumb I am very reluctant to pass it on and \n            us=\r\nually those are the ones that get the biggest confirmations tho it \n       =\r\n     means nothing to me at the time. So yes quite possibly evp work can \n =\r\n           be used the same as mediumship in missing persons cases.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n            &lt;BR&gt;&gt; For me tone of voice has grown to mean nothing. It i=\r\ns a \n            treat when they manage to come across sounding as they did=\r\n when in \n            physical form here but I look beyond the tone of voic=\r\ne. Often people \n            get a childs voice and they become saddened by=\r\n the thought that a \n            child is earthbound. But I see it just as =\r\na representation of voice \n            and whether it comes across as male =\r\nfemale child or robot matters \n            little to me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I=\r\n do find they often resume the \n            &quot;character&quot; they played because=\r\n after all that is sort of what we \n            are, characters in some gia=\r\nnt play. Whether it is the beliefs they \n            had which were their t=\r\nrademark, the tone of voice, their image, or \n            use of some nickn=\r\name even I dont know about I look at it all as just \n            a pixel in=\r\n a larger portrait that some part survives once the body \n            has c=\r\neased to function. And the message is simply, our energy \n            conti=\r\nnues on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Quote by Einstein: &#39;Energy cannot be \n           =\r\n created or destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to \n           =\r\n another.&#39;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Misty (the insomniac is up way tooooo \n        =\r\n    late and rambling on LOL)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Tue, 9/15/09, \n      =\r\n      mrscaptainjack2 &lt;jjkamp@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n=\r\n            From: mrscaptainjack2 &lt;jjkamp@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [EVP-=\r\nITC] \n            Voice inflections?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A \n            href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://us.mc329.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3DEVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; \n  =\r\n          rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank \n            ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:EVP=\r\n-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups \n            .com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; D=\r\nate: Tuesday, September 15, 2009, 9:56 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n            &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I was googling about AM radio reception, \n            and I =\r\ncame across the below exchange on a forum. It talks about \n            usin=\r\ng the box to find missing persons (which I didn&#39;t know was \n            pos=\r\nsible), and the conversation mentions hearing specific voice \n            i=\r\nnflections and recognizing a dead person&#39;s specific voice on the \n         =\r\n   box. My question is, do any of you get a recognizable voice? The \n      =\r\n      voices I get always sound robotic, although I do get clearly male or =\r\n\n            female voices. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.itcbrid=\r\ng/&quot; \n            rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.itcbridg&lt;/A&gt; e.c=\r\nom/forum/ \n            view_topic. php?id=3D515&amp; forum_id=3D \n         =\r\n 31&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;=\r\n&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--End group email --&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTM=\r\nL&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_01F7_01CA36E4.94ED3F20--"}
