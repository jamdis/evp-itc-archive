<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, it was your post. I only question what are subconscious may know that we do not. It is due to the whole idea of automatic writing. I have written things I don&#x27;t feel are from me. Psychology would say it is probably just my subconscious. So I jump between realms of thought. I could downplay certain psychic abilities with psychology. It has left me wondering if I am really talking to my dead sister or if it a way of processing the past. I forget the details, but I guess my mom was going to have twins, but I was what came.
     I do know that psychology cannot explain certain things. Your post got me really interested in that device. I believe everything is connected. I do not doubt that you heard no sirens and such or your experience. I guess I just question how it works, as all of us do here.
Thank you for your thoughts and prayers.

&gt; Jennifer,
&gt; 
&gt; I had an iovulus tell me there was an accident with police etc is that was you were referencing?
&gt; 
&gt; If so, I had NO clue as where I live is out in farm land. I don&#x27;t hear sirens unless it is late at night and all our kids are in bed and it is dead silence in my home. That day our 3 kids were home and totally bouncing off the walls.. I was actually playing with the device as I was in the bathroom and getting dressed, makeup etc. So there was no influence on what I heard.
&gt; 
&gt; I know a good house cleansing is wonderful! I am not sure what you are experiencing but I would like you to know you will be in my thoughts and prayers!!

&gt; &gt;I have been silent out of fear. Sometimes the ridicule gets hard to take. I know that sometimes mind does influence perception of reality. The other day I was brought back to quantum physics. They talk of an observer and how just the observer being there can change things. I was thinking it is like when I sing. I sing much better when I am alone than when I think someone can hear me. 
&gt; &gt;     This goes into old teachings. the &quot;As above , so below.&quot; A lot of people seem to believe humans are the only thing that feel and think. I do not believe this, as I have witnessed strange occurrences.
&gt; &gt;We should be having someone over to bless our house soon. The energy needs cleansed and I feel too drained to attempt it.
&gt; &gt;     I am very interested in one of the things posted. It was about Global consciousness project. Someone had posted about an experience where they were told by device about a wreck around the corner, or something like that. I wonder if their subconscious picked up on it and it manifested on their device. I know it could be other things as well. As humans it is often us putting limits on what is possible that keeps us from our full potential. At least thats my thoughts at this time.
&gt; &gt;   And don&#x27;t give up just because others may not believe. In my invention books I have found  a lot of times it is those who are called crazy and mocked that actually progress things. Recently I read that Marconi was put in an asylum for telling them about the technology we use today. 
&gt; &gt;     I have many thoughts. If I am to make a ghost box with the radio I have I am probably going to need help. I didn&#x27;t make it far in my electronics course before getting ill. I want to read more throughout the site and others to see if I can do it without bothering anyone.
&gt; &gt;    I know I kind of come and go. I hope you don&#x27;t mind. Everyone has always called me a free spirit. I tend to just go wherever my heart takes me.
