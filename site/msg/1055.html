<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Okay, thanks. I&#x27;d like to try that method in the next week or so. I did try 
with a solar panel once, and got a weak voice after your discritptin last 
year. You mean like a Kerosene lamp?

&gt;The design I came up with is much simpler. A flame is used as the 
&gt;&#x27;vibrating element&#x27;. A phototransistor from Radio Shack is used in place of 
&gt;a microphone. Of all the tests I ran, a simple oil burning lamp has worked 
&gt;best. The lamp must have a flat, wide wick 3/4 to one inch across (very 
&gt;important). The phototransistor will function with the phantom voltage 
&gt;supplied from most digital recorders or sound cards. Very simple concept, 
&gt;most people who see it are amazed at the simplicity. You will not find 
&gt;plans on the internet except on AAEVP, I published an article almost two 
&gt;years ago for thier news letter. Since that time I have simplified the 
&gt;design to the two parts I have mentioned.
