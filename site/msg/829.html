Jackson...presently residing in Huntington Beach, CA (THE Orange 
County...right next to LA) but I'm originally from Illinois. I have 
a BS in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois at 
Champaign (in the top 5 of engineering colleges) along with a 
certificate in advanced software technologies from the University of 
California at Irvine. I've worked in the technical industry for many 
years now (including 2 1/2 years at the NASA Langley Research Center 
in Hampton, VA).

I've done independent research into many areas of consciousness for 
years now: brain wave studies, biofeedback, hypnosis, shamanism, 
isolation tanks (the politically correct term now is floatation 
tank), etc. I joined several paranormal groups a little over 2 years 
ago and volunteered to be the audio data coordinator for Paranormal 
Research Investigations out of Anaheim, CA led by OOB researcher Al 
Taylor (wrote the book "Soul Traveler" and has been a long-time 
guest on Coast-To-Coast AM). I'm a member of the AAEVP and gave my 
first public lectures on EVP at the first Ghost Fest on the Queen 
Mary back in November. I've been interviewed on APSR Paranormal Talk 
Radio, Haunted Voices Radio and C2C - AM.

At present - I'm doing more study on acoustics and human 
language/hearing along with psychic ability in order to extend my 
research interests in EVP (I actually use the term "PSP" for 
Paranormal Sound Phenomena). I've found some interesting things out 
with respect to the infamous Spiricom, tracked down the apartment 
where Ray Bayless and Attila Von Szalay did the first organized 
research into EVP and have obtained copies of the "first spirit 
voices" ever recorded and recordings of the sounds discovered in 
what I feel was the first time EVP was used in an alleged haunted 
location.

Whew!

Probably more than anyone wanted to know about me...
