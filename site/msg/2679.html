Lisby,
 
No one was perpitrating an outrage fest the only thing I was insin=
uating was that in the 
begging for everyone including myself evp is very h=
ard to recognize and interpret even by 
a seasoned pro like yourself. I wis=
h there were people around when I started with evp research 
to lend a hand=
 and some constructive criticism so I didn't have to flounder around for su=
ch a long 
time trying to figure it out on my own. I'm sure if dave felt he=
 was being unduely crircised he would have spoken up himself.

VP-ITC] No evidence is accptable!?




Hey guys, not to interrupt the outra=
gefest here, but there are times when what you're seeing and hearing just d=
oesn't agree with what someone else does. There where times when, for examp=
le, when a late member of another group showed me pictures where he was abs=
olutely sure they showed something paranormal and all I saw was zip--someti=
mes not even enough to blame it on pattern recognition. We'd argue until th=
e old saw was trotted out, "You skeptics don't believe anything." I'd alway=
s assure him that I did, in fact, accept the reality of EVP, life after dea=
th, UFOs, time travel, and any number of other paranormal issues, and just =
because I did not perceive one piece of potential evidence was actually evi=
dence, it was very unfair to tar and feather me. 

There have been times wh=
en I heard a clear EVP and no one else did and times that others insisted t=
hey clearly heard one and I did not. (And I have to add that sometimes list=
ening for EVPs amidst a long stream of bandwidth tuning diminishes them for=
 me--it makes them sound much more likely to be broadcast fragments. Unless=
 you have good headphones and are listening very carefully to each syllable=
, it sounds like junk.) 

Also, please keep in mind that when you solicit a=
 stranger's opinion, you need to accept the fact that you may not get the v=
alidation you are looking for. I get hundreds of supposed paranormal pics s=
ent to me each year. 99.9 are camera artifacts. I only write back to the on=
es I think may be possibly paranormal because if I write back and say it is=
 a camera artifact, then I end up in a slanging match with the person who s=
ent it and I assure you that every conversation includes the sentence "Well=
, you skeptics don't believe anything!"

I don't know this person that all =
the slanging is going on about here, but I do know that he, like me, simply=
 may not hear it, may not want to be involved for whatever reason, or may j=
ust be in a bad mood that someone is demanding he agree with them when he h=
onestly doesn't. There is nothing wrong with that. It doesn't make him the =
twin brother of James Randi or even a simple skeptic.

Have some mercy on p=
eople who don't see with you eye to eye. Agree to disagree. Be good to each=
 other, for chrissakes. This is not an all-or-nothing issue. And I think th=
at once you come to the conclusion that you have experienced enough high st=
rangeness to know, without a doubt, that the basic fact that the Other Side=
 and far more exists, then the need for every possible piece of evidence to=
 be real fades away. We're not looking for evidence. We have it already. We=
're looking for the best evidence possible.
