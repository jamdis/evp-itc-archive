I imagine that with mediumship as well as evp its all just "interesting" bi=
ts of info until someone can confirm the information coming thru as concret=
e evidence. I also imagine theres a long line of people attempting contact =
with MJ at this very moment and attempting confimation thru other avenues l=
ike you are. Maybe wait a bit then try again and perhaps they will respond =
to your messages. Keep us informed Bonnie!

I think Jim is more excited =
he got a response to his question than anything. (Yayyy Jim!) It is very ex=
citing work! I also know that often information is given for family in grie=
f that has little to do with us. I dont always understand the information o=
r weird nicknames are given that seem irrelevant to me but to the family me=
mber its means everything and makes perfect sense. They never cease to amaz=
e me with the confirmations that there is more to life after the body passe=
s.

Spirit has ways of making sure the messages get thru to the right pe=
rson at the right time. The method they choose to use is up to them and isn=
