The diffence between the 12-820 and new 12-469 is amazing. There is 
no clicking what so ever on either band. The Am band is so quiet I 
had to look at the radio to make sure it was still sweeping! I tried 
it out this morning for a bit but didnt get anything. I hope they 
like the new radio.

&gt; Thanks for the update, Kay.  I&#x27;ve also noticed varying sweep times 
between AM &amp; FM on other 
&gt; models.  Not sure if the actual rate of sweep differs, for just 
the amount of channels there is 
&gt; to be swept on one band versus another, so it takes longer to 
complete one full cycle.
