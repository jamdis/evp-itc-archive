Have you had it happen while you were away from the boxes, like going about normal errands around the house or about to fall asleep?

          Rhonda,
 
I have my name mentioned at least 10 times during a normal session, before the big tech mix up mike and lisa would 
adress me by my name constantly, usually one of the first things a new researcher hears is their name being called
I believe our friends do this to give immediate validation to the new box user that they are indeed recieving spirit
communication.

        Hey Mike,
   
  Ive actually heard or thought I heard my name being called a few times...the first time I kinda brushed it off as me being overly tired but Ive had it happen a few times since when I wasnt overly tired.  I havent heard anything else just my name.  Id be curious to know if others had this happen to them too.

        That is funnny.. Yeah, I am amazed they can see us, and to think even before I got involved in Box EVP, I never thought once that they are right here in the room with us.
   
  Have a question for you. Margaret had mentioned in one of her posts that once we start Box Research, if we never have before, we are more likely to become chairaudient.
   
  Last night, was amazing for me while lying in bed. I heard them talking to me for the first time. It was really neat.
   
  Has this happened to you yet, or even to Kristin since the three of us are relatively new at this?
