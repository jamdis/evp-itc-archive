<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I do understand what you mean... That&#x27;s simply one test, through one 
of the groups I belong to. Even so, I will continue to be open and 
honest in this effort. 

I&#x27;m not sure if it will work or not for the express purpose of 
getting in touch with a particular soul. Time will tell.

&gt; Good stuff!I&#x27;ve likewise been engaged in pre-Box encouragement. For 
instance, I know I&#x27;m not the only one that has ideas come to them 
while taking a shower. Sunday afternoon, while so occupied, a notion 
came strongly over me, which is just the awaited nudge I was waiting 
for before buying a MiniBox myself. I had an almost electrical 
feeling to utilize a MiniBox at a shamanic studies class my shaman 
teacher begun, and I facilitate now. You see he past away back in 
April and it&#x27;s my impression he wishes for that group to try 
communicating with him! I&#x27;ve got both eyes and ears open. I&#x27;m also 
going to ask the right sort of questions to test whether or not is 
indeed the fellow. I&#x27;m very hopefully but we shall see...Lance--- In

&gt; I can&#x27;t wait to start with mine.&gt; &gt; A few days ago I, as I was 
driving home alone, I turned on the tape &gt; recorder I carry for 
interviews. I played it back as I was still &gt; driving. During one 
part, I told them about the box and what I wanted &gt; them to do once I 
had it. I said, &quot;Talk to me, guys.&quot; Right afterward &gt; a male voice 
said, &quot;Talking.&quot; I was one big smile for an hour.&gt; &gt; Ann&gt; &gt; &gt; On Dec

asking Chris about life and death or heaven&gt; &gt; and hell, I plan to:&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; 1)Take a training class provided freely by ASUP.&gt; &gt; 2)Engage in 
a little direct inquiry and testing of spirits.&gt; &gt; 3)Strongly 
encourage fearless people to find their own answers, by&gt; &gt; doing

&gt; &gt; I think you make my point very well. You say you don&#x27;t know 
Chris&gt; &gt; &gt; personally but that it seems I am the one wearing rose 
colored&gt; &gt; &gt; glasses. I do know Chris. Even when Frank is upset he 
says &quot;Chris&gt; &gt; is a&gt; &gt; &gt; nice guy&quot;. Chris&#x27; statements and beliefs 
have never changed while&gt; &gt; &gt; others can be wishy washy depending on 
the day. The view that Chris&gt; &gt; &gt; does not want any one to research 
the box besides him is BS. The&gt; &gt; fact&gt; &gt; &gt; is that prior to Franks 
original yahoo group disappearing, Chris&gt; &gt; &gt; provided a link 
directly to the schematics. In his presentations he&gt; &gt; &gt; would tell 
people that the schematics were available online. Yet,&gt; &gt; &gt; because 
he is against mass production, it MUST be because he wants&gt; &gt; the&gt; &gt; 
&gt; research all to himself. Rose colored glasses or a case of only&gt; &gt; 
seeing&gt; &gt; &gt; what is wanted? This is a fact compared to perceptions 
and&gt; &gt; opinions.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Almost each and every user of a box 
or it&#x27;s facsimile have&gt; &gt; &gt; stated that lower energy/evil/dark... 
entities have spoken via the&gt; &gt; &gt; device.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Rick Moran 
states that the groups for testing will include&gt; &gt; &gt; believers, 
skeptics, senior citizens, (now here&#x27;s where it gets&gt; &gt; scary)&gt; &gt; &gt; 
CHILDREN and HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS!&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; - Couple the last two 
facts together and do the math. One mentally&gt; &gt; &gt; unstable child or 
youth hears the box tell him it is right to kill&gt; &gt; or&gt; &gt; &gt; rape 
or .....&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Rick Moran in his article about Tools being 
only as good as&gt; &gt; the&gt; &gt; &gt; users states, &quot;...know how they work 
before you go into the field.&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; So, in one place we are still 
testing, in another we are sending&gt; &gt; them&gt; &gt; &gt; out in the field to 
be tested by groups that include children and&gt; &gt; high&gt; &gt; &gt; school 
students. The good thing is that a nice little online&gt; &gt; tutorial&gt; &gt; 
&gt; is available with some warnings. Phew! As long as this can&#x27;t come&gt; 
&gt; back&gt; &gt; &gt; on anyone I guess all the bases are covered (tongue in 
cheek).&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Chris has been the primary tester of the 
device in the field.&gt; &gt; &gt; That fact deserves consideration, at the 
very least.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Last night, a radio personality on Spooky 
South Coast claimed&gt; &gt; &gt; that after he engaged the dark voices coming 
through the box, he was&gt; &gt; &gt; physically attacked.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: 
Frank has stated that in the beginning Chris was the only one&gt; &gt; &gt; 
who understood how the box should be used.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Some 
people who have received boxes from Frank discovered they&gt; &gt; &gt; were 
not able to use them although they worked fine for Frank. These&gt; &gt; &gt; 
same people would not return the boxes to be looked at.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 
Fact: After death communications have been received via both&gt; &gt; 
computers&gt; &gt; &gt; and phones. If it were simply the devices and not the 
users would we&gt; &gt; &gt; not have millions of these communications?&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Fact: Mark Macy states that in an after death communication&gt; &gt; &gt; 
communication with Konstanin Raudive in which Mark asks &quot; Can you&gt; &gt; 
tell&gt; &gt; &gt; me about the equipment you use to produce a perfect, almost 
perfect&gt; &gt; &gt; voice on earth?&quot; Konstanin replies &quot;Well it depends on 
your&gt; &gt; reception-&gt; &gt; &gt; or mainly your psychic reception.&quot; This fact 
backs up the theory&gt; &gt; that&gt; &gt; &gt; effective users are limited.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Fact: In another after death communication Konstanin addresses&gt; &gt; 
contact&gt; &gt; &gt; fields saying &quot;...but if there is dissonance in the form 
of fears,&gt; &gt; &gt; doubts, and animosities the contact field becomes 
cloudy...that&#x27;s&gt; &gt; when&gt; &gt; &gt; negative spirit groups close to earth in 
vibration can break into&gt; &gt; &gt; existing bridges with troubling 
results.&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; And so yes, maybe I wear rose colored 
glasses. However, I am&gt; &gt; inclined&gt; &gt; &gt; to believe that I have done 
my research and have availed myself of&gt; &gt; &gt; quite a bit of 
information regarding this topic.&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; With that said, I am 
holding an online event where people can ask&gt; &gt; &gt; Chris the questions 
they want as long as they are formed in an&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligent manner. 
If you are interested in attending the event you&gt; &gt; &gt; can find the 
information on the front page of my site at&gt; &gt; &gt; 
www.thepsinetwork.com I felt it unnecessary to attempt to &quot;bridge&gt; &gt; 
the&gt; &gt; &gt; gap&quot; as well between speculation, insinuation and fact.&gt; &gt;

&gt; Hey Bab,&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even though I&#x27;ve newly begun to chime in 
here, it seems to me&gt; &gt; that&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some people are guilty of wearing 
rose colored glasses, as far as&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris is concerned. LOL! I 
don&#x27;t know him personally, so I really&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#x27;t know what really 
motivates him. Right or wrong, by&gt; &gt; conducting&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself in the 
manner he has, it&#x27;s understandable why his&gt; &gt; approach&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has 
drawn the scrutiny from his peers.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frankly, this entire 
effort is a great learning experience and&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; potential healing 
for mankind! I encourage all of us researcher&gt; &gt; types&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to 
simply sit back, and take a deep breath or three. Consider&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
together why we&#x27;re doing this. Let&#x27;s work on making this world a&gt; &gt; &gt;
