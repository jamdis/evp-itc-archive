Some folks think it is a modulated em\n&gt; field in proximity to the microphone. There is evidence to support this, as\n&gt; evp has been recorded in faraday cages and vacuum jars. It would then be\n&gt; logical to assume that evp is independent of vibratory sound waves. Then\n&gt; that is blown to hell when you consider that Waldemar Bogoras is credited\n&gt; with the first reported evp capture while recording rituals of the Tchoutki\n&gt; tribe in Siberia in 1901. The was with a mechanical gramaphone-like device,\n&gt; no microphone, just a horn to amplify sound, mechanical &quot;write&quot; needle, and\n&gt; wax cylinder. Electric gramaphones didn&#39;t come about till almost the &#39;20s.\n&gt; In that case it would appear that evp exists as soundwaves and not em\n&gt; fields.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Which one is right? Both probably, and that isn&#39;t even taking into\n&gt; account the mechanism involved in box-related evp.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Intent and desire to communicate. The rest works itself out.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; Andy\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; And all of this supports the notion that the real underlying principle is\n&gt; actually psychokinesis, most likely of the operator but possibly of some\n&gt; external agent as well. This would not require any external &#39;power&#39; in the\n&gt; sense we normally think of it, and would explain why such voices are\n&gt; recorded in powered and non-powered devices all using various recording\n&gt; media. It would also explain the presence of audio and video since PK\n&gt; appears to be an ability to affect the environment with the mind, which\n&gt; could extend to manipulating or creating video and audio signals.\n&gt;\n&gt; In this context, conducting (or perhaps more correctly replicating) tests\n&gt; in Faraday cages makes sense; in that one could then rule out anything\n&gt; electromagnetic as a potential source. It may or may not be the case that\n&gt; the sweep signal is critical to voice production. This is actually a notion\n&gt; that needs further clarification - the presence of noise seems beneficial,\n&gt; but is it required? Finding voices inside a Faraday cage in a replicated\n&gt; test would actually be a very helpful outcome to advancing the research.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nCan you poin me o he Sibe ian ibe in o ma ion.
