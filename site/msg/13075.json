The production \ncompanies know that they can not capture and keep an audience with \nslow or no action, and a theme that drags on.\nThey need that high energy spark to keep the viewers coming back, \nespecially viewers who are not able to get out and do investigations \nas much as they&#39;d like or for those that have never done an \ninvestgation, but like ghost hunting stuff.\n\nTheir show ratings depend on viewer numbers which equate to \nadvertising dollars.  That is the bottom line for any show and \nentertainment venue on TV or radio.\n\nSo... what you are seeing with all that over-drama stuff is for \nentertainment and shouldn&#39;t be taken as serious investigation.\n\nThat&#39;s how I see it at least, and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t usually watch \nthose type shows, although I will check them out once-in-awhile to \nsee if they are using any type of new tool or paranormal device.\n\nShows like &quot;Haunting Evidence&#39; that don&#39;t have screamng, running, and \nconstant yapping when none should be happening, don&#39;t last.\n&#39;Haunting Evidence&#39; was just dropped from the TruTV lineup. They \ntried to be a more serious documentary type show, whether they really \nwere or not? But it didn&#39;t work for the rating numbers.\n\nI think you&#39;ll be seeing more and more of the &#39;entertainment&#39; type \ninvestigation shows being put on a number of different networks, \nbecause that&#39;s what&#39;s selling right now.\n\nRhonda, the type of good manners investigation you are describing \ndoes happen I&#39;m guessing in many groups around the world, when a \nproduction company is not involved.
