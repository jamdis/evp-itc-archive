It's always refreshing to read your input Bruce.  Funny thing is, I recogni=

 facilitators and guardians, that they are consistent in their ability to u=

oseful, as compared to so much that seems to have no rhyme or reason.  

As=
 a newbie I'm admittedly intimidated by and in awe of the results you more =
experienced researchers are accomplishing.  What I find most awesome is tha=
t everyone can have different methods, belief systems and opinions and come=
 together in one forum to share and learn from one another.  I feel so luck=
y to have found you!  Bruce, your ability to hear and accurately repeat my =
one posted EVP is the only validation I've personally ever received that ma=

 to be here!  I think a big part of my education will continue to come from=
 the knowledge and experience you all are willing to keep sharing.  It's al=

  Robin,
   
  I agree with Steve on a couple of point=
s. First let me say that I
  do believe that we all have a "technician/guid=
e/guardian" call them what you
  may. but I usually call them by the names =
they introduced themselves by.
   
  I know for a fact through many, many, =
many box sessions that when I turn
  a box on, could be Frank's box or the =
minibox or the RS 470 does not matter which.
   
  The same two entities wi=
ll come through immediately, So much so now, that I do not even ask for con=
formation that
  it is in fact them. I recognise their individual voice pat=
terns. I have built a solid relationship with these two spirits
  I know as=
 mike and Lisa so much so that I have even gotten to know their individual =
personalities.
   
  There are other newer researchers here that will attes=
t to the fact that when they where doing their first sessions
  I had asked=
 my two "Friends" Mike and Lisa to assist in getting them started and invar=
iably the spirits that came 
  through to these new researchers during thei=
r first sessions identified themselves as Mike and Lisa.
   
  Steve says h=
e does not turn on his box and use them as a crutch, that is not entirely t=
rue. I had done research 
  very closely with Steve until recently and I wo=
uld venture to say that 99% if not every session he starts with "Mike & Lis=
a
  are you available to talk with me" 
   
  Also I don't consider working=
 with my technicians as using them as a crutch, They would not allow that.
=
  They are not there like butlers at our beckoned call when we feel they ma=
y be of some use.
  Quite the opposite, without them we would get no commun=
ication at all, they are allowing us the honor of receiving this 
  celesti=
al communication. They are the moderators, facilitators and generators of a=
ll we hear and send to and from the spirit realm.
  And they also stand as =
guards and protectors to do the best they can to keep us from being deceive=
d or taken down a dark path.
   
  Some here wait for others to state an op=
inion and then tend to agree with that opinion no matter what they have exp=
erienced to be true.
   
  Robin, my advice to you as a new researcher in t=
his field. Form your own beliefs through your experience and research.
  Li=
sten and learn from others but do not let what you believe to be true or no=
t, be swayed by popular opinion.

    Steve,

    I certainly appreciate your thought=
s.  In the back of my mind is always the question of whether we are being D=
eceived.  Just for the sake of argument, is it POSSIBLE we're being manipul=

      If i may add my thoughts on this: There is no concrete evidence of=
