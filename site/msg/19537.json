We have a\nTV show that plays throughout Central NY (accessible to over 1.5\nmillion viewers total) called CNY Spirits.\n\nIn this episode, which has been uploaded to youtube, you can see the\nMinibox Plus on an investigation.  It was used in tandem with a poker\ngame and garnered some amazing results.  The Minibox was used in part\n2, and everyones favorite shack hack was used in part 3.  To my\nknowledge, this is the first time a Minibox has been used on\ntelevision.  You will have to ignore what Stacey says about the\nMinibox because she was dead wrong on most of her facts.  I wish that\nthe producer had interviewed me so I could have explained it a helluva\nlot better.\n\nIf you are wondering, I am the goofy looking guy with the pony tail and tattoos.\n\nYou can check out pt 1 here:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anxfj8Dlrus&feature=related\n\nThis episode was a followup investigation to a prior one done about 6\nweeks earlier.  This earlier investigation yielded some amazing EVP&#39;s\nand flashlight responses.  YOu can view pt 1 here:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey6uHks4aj4&feature=related\n\nThese are some of the clips from that session.\n\nThe clip about &quot;pissing me off&quot; has become pretty famous because\nStacey uses it when she lectures at conferences.  It is very\nintriguing because it is her voice coming through the Hack while she\nis sitting at the table.  I have discussed this clip with a few of\nyou, and here it is a lot cleaner than in the video.\n\nThe rest of the clips are from the poker session that were not in the\nvideo.  On the &quot;Holding a Five&quot; clip, Mike actually had a pair of\nfives in his hand.\n\nTim"}
