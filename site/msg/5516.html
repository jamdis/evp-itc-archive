&gt; &gt; Hi Debbie,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My experience is that it may or may not be the same entities.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I know that does not answer your question, let me explain.
&gt; &gt; If you are an established researcher with an assigned technician
&gt; &gt; most likely it will predominantly be the same spirit that is
&gt; communicating.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There will also be other spirits that will come through with their
&gt; individual messages of course
&gt; &gt; but your tech/guide will dominate the communication.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There are a couple of reasons you would get different sounding
&gt; spirit communication
&gt; &gt; the first being that at all different times of the day different
&gt; radio stations are broadcasting
&gt; &gt; a myriad of different sounds. The entities trying to communicate
&gt; will use whatever fragments
&gt; &gt; of sound they need to form the message and the sound signal changes
&gt; from second to second.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thus the different sounding voices. The second reason is each
&gt; different box will produce it&#x27;s own unique
&gt; &gt; sound such as the minibox as apposed to the super radio each
&gt; produce a distinctive sound.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Lastly, if you are new to box research you may not have a permanent
&gt; tech/guide assigned yet and who ever is available
&gt; &gt; at the time of your session will take control of that session. I
&gt; find that your tech does not bother to seek out recognisable
&gt; &gt; noise fragments to form his or her message until you have developed
&gt; a working relationship as well as a personal one with them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There is no exact explanation for any of this, it is all conjecture
&gt; by the individual researcher but I try to answer any questions based
&gt; on my experience.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I hope this answer helps. Please feel free to ask any thing at any
&gt; time and I&#x27;ll do my best to help.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone find that each &quot;Box&quot; has a different group of people
&gt; speaking and helping?I&#x27;ve swept &quot;Manually&quot;, used the &quot;MiniBox&quot; and
&gt; the &quot;SuperBox&quot; and there seems to be a different set of people on
&gt; each device. Thanks,Debbie
