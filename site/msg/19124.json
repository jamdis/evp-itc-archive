I used to work at a recording\nstudio that had 4 reverb plates from the 1950&#39;s.  They were so big that they\nhad to be hung in a semi trailer.  All audio outboard reverb&#39;s available\ntoday function on the same principle as your echo chamber, but the use solid\nstate circuitry and chips to accomplish the task.\n\nIs it possible to include an echo chamber section that is separate from the\ninternal component section of your box?  A box connected to your box but is\nseparated by thick wood?  This may cut down on your problem of portability,\nbut may not entirely get rid of the problem because waves are so large that\nthey conduct through wood (put your ear to the back of an electric guitar or\nbass and strum it, you will still hear a little).  If you attached your\nchamber to the box, had it separated by solid wood, and gave it ventilation\nslits, you might not have this problem anymore.\n\nThe demonic sound is not surprising.  Most commercial reverbs allow for\npre-delay (the sound and then the reverb) in milliseconds, and decay (how\nlong the sound lasts after).  Your echo chambers don&#39;t have this so if you\nbuild it on a big board, it is like the reverb is equivalent to yelling in a\nconcert hall versus if your echo chamber was built on a smaller board it\nwould sound like yelling in a bathroom.  The safe effect, only the result is\ncurtailed.\n\nThe original reverb plates which are kind of like your current echo chamber\nwere built in a wooden box that had limited width but were significant in\nlength and height.  Inside of the box were two metal plates.  The sound was\nfed into the box and the amount of reverb was controlled by turning a wheel\nthat moved the plates closer to each other or farther apart, and this\ncontrolled the amount of the reverb.\n\nYour boxes will always sound better with reverb, it is like singing in the\nshower.  Because of the reverberation the voice sounds fuller.\n\nOn Wed, Oct 27, 2010 at 12:14 PM, Frank Sumption\n&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  [Attachment(s) &lt;#12bee77d4833b4b9_TopText&gt; from Frank Sumption included\n&gt; below]\n&gt;\n&gt;  Feedback is the big problem with the internal echo chamber. For a while I\n&gt; was leaving out the echo chamber, but trying to provide external chambers\n&gt; was a problem too, it makes the box less portable. The chamber adds\n&gt; &quot;something&quot;, kinda like a filter, plus &quot;they&quot; seems to be able to make their\n&gt; voices easier. Usually I can drill holes in the cabinet to relive the\n&gt; feedback, with this box I had to seal the whole thing with silicone. I had a\n&gt; better seal between the battery compartment and the main compartment, so I\n&gt; guess sound was finding other ways to interact.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The chamber speaker is less than an inch in diameter, and the mic just a\n&gt; standard electret.  I use three tubes, instead of the two shown in the\n&gt; diagram so I can get more separation. The larger the chamber the more\n&gt; pronounced the enhancement effect, the voices are almost scary. I made one\n&gt; once that was 12 inch by 48 inch MDF board lined with aluminum foil with\n&gt; crystals and magnets glued on the insides, OMG  I had to take to it apart!\n&gt; That was frikkin&#39; demonic.\n&gt;\n&gt;  That&#39;s one reason I don&#39;t have a fixed design, there&#39;s just too much to\n&gt; this.\n&gt;\n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, Oct 27, 2010 at 6:12 AM, Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is a simple concept as to why the vents cut down on feedback.  As a\n&gt;&gt; former live sound engineer, feedback was quite the nemesis.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If I remember reading right, you have a small microphone and a small\n&gt;&gt; speaker in your &quot;echo chamber.&quot;  A feedback loop happens when a speaker\n&gt;&gt; produces audio and a microphone pics that audio up.  The thing is, if the\n&gt;&gt; speaker and microphone are not far enough apart from one another, a feedback\n&gt;&gt; loop occurs where the audio loop between microphone to speaker keeps\n&gt;&gt; building up and frequencies start to converge into feedback.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Considering that your echo chamber is right under the batteries, the\n&gt;&gt; microphone in the echo chamber is probably picking up the audio from the\n&gt;&gt; main speaker output at the same time as the output that is in the echo\n&gt;&gt; chamber.  The two sources picked up at the same time is causing the\n&gt;&gt; feedback.   By venting the battery chamber, the soundwaves from the main\n&gt;&gt; speaker  are being released easier from the hollow design of the box.  This\n&gt;&gt; allows for the natural reverberation caused by speaker output to stop\n&gt;&gt; reverberating around inside the box, it is this bouncing around of audio\n&gt;&gt; that is= eventually picked up by your echo chamber microphone at the same\n&gt;&gt; time and becomes feedback.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The same thing happens during a concert when a performer gets his\n&gt;&gt; microphone to close to the floor monitor.  A feedback loop occurs because\n&gt;&gt; the singer hear&#39;s his voice in the floor monitor at the same time as it is\n&gt;&gt; coming out of his mouth.  A loop occurs where the frequencies build upon\n&gt;&gt; each other and feedback happens.  In your case, the microphone inside the\n&gt;&gt; echo chamber is simply picking up the main speaker at the same time as the\n&gt;&gt; speaker in your echo box, causing the same audio pattern.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hope this helps,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tim\n&gt;&gt; On Wed, Oct 27, 2010 at 2:38 AM, Frank Sumption &lt;\n&gt;&gt; purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  [Attachment(s)&lt;https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&view=js&name=main,tlist&ver=vDkaykVSG9w.en.&am=!yGvcqUNUUxexhZ5ijtQ2ZMKIZroesisZtoKH5kognAihF0mgsh4P&fri#12bed9ab56331f24_12bec6a7bae7ff88_TopText&gt;from Frank Sumption included below]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The battery box is on top of the echo chamber, and venting the door helps\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cut the feedback for some weird acoustical reason.
