One of the best boxes you sold, Frank was that  one Sharon had, it was a 
g=
reat, great spirit box, she used it for our  online sessions.  I really mis=
s 
that, we got lots of people talking on it,  and I was able to pull a ful=
l 
sessions from one of the recordings, in  reverse!   I got clearly, my fu=
ll 
name, first, middle and last,  it was a very wonderful box.  Whom ever =
has it 
now, hope they appreciate  it, not sure which box it was, it may ha=
ve been 
called, "Mini box."  I also  got many long, full sentences, from i=
t too.  sf
