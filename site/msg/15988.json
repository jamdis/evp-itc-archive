It&#39;s not always the same voices, and it doesn&#39;t matter waht I&#39;m using. But--I did do an EVP session last night and they said it was an unethical spirit doing that-then they talked about end of cycles stuff-so what&#39;s the difference?\n\n F-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mrscaptainjack2&quot; &lt;jjkamp@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank, have you tried asking this entity who tells you this doomsday stuff to go toward the light?  Or otherwise leave you alone?  I&#39;m wondering if he/she/it is hogging the spotlight and not letting anyone else through.  That time I was getting bullshit answers from &quot;Steve,&quot; and my Uncle Red came through, I swear I heard someone say, &quot;Get away from me&quot; -- as if Red was trying to talk, and Steve was getting in the way somehow.  Just a thought:  maybe your guys are keeping more desirable contact with benevolent entities at bay.  (Like I know anything, I&#39;m a newbie! Feel free to ignore my posts!  But I just feel so bad for you, that you keep getting all this doomsday stuff.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Jill\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Went on one of the ghost hunts on the Queen may, but I don&#39;t get anything\n&gt; &gt; related to tat stuff, I get this stuff--everywhere.  I have my doubts about\n&gt; &gt; it beng true, maybe just fear junk from some level.
