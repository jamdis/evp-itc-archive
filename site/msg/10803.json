I know that shot as \n&gt; well as many of your other e-mails are directed at me because your an \n&gt; angry bitter person, you may have noticed that i do not say anything \n&gt; bad about you. Why would 2 wrongs make a right? I seem to post some \n&gt; stuff from all different methods, maybe one will click and move us to a \n&gt; better level of communication.

I already keep \n&gt; &gt; the group e-mail off, cuz I don&#39;t care about someone&#39;s latest hundred \n&gt; &gt; recordings. It seems like just a bunch of showing off. &quot;I just posted \n&gt; &gt; the latest....blah-blah-blah-blah&quot; Who gives a crap? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Yeah, negative, maybe. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
