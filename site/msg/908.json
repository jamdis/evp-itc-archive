People ask me when did I become \ninterested in &quot;them&quot; and rather than answer my reply is usually its \nmore like when did &quot;they&quot; become interested in me.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   We&#39;d love to hear your evp you get during your experiment. I \nchecked my files and tho there are many hello&#39;s said many different \nways I have never had a &quot;yes hello&quot; to my knowledge.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   As for the itc pics, I guess some could be considered &quot;scary&quot; LOL \nbut I have never had any fear about any of this. I&#39;ve dealt with the \nparanormal so long that to me its just normal. Tho when I first \nstarted the itc pics I would get hundreds of eyes staring back at me, \nit was a bit creepy. Then during evp they mentioned the pics and \nsaid &quot;echo six is ready we have to look happy to you&quot; so I did more \nitc and got alot of smiles and teeth. Creepier LOL. In later evp \nsomeone said &quot;I told you were looking happy&quot;.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   They have also shown me pics/artwork of the &quot;living&quot;. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   I find it all quite fascinating.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Misty\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; We won&#39;t tell.
