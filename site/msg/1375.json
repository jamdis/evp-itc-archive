The articles are published this month in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; TAPS Paramagazine.  The pdf can be viewed at\n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://spiritfaces.com/x200706ParamagArticl.pdf.  For those not in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ghost work, TAPS is The Paranormal Atlantic Society, members of whom\n&gt;&gt;&gt; star in The SciFiChannel&#39;s  popular Ghost Hunters reality show.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Briefly, at a Ghost Hunters haunted week at The Stanley Hotel in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Colorado in March, the 200+ attendees were given demonstrations of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the box by Chris Moon.  There were two open mike nights in which  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; lots\n&gt;&gt;&gt; were drawn for people to come up and ask questions via the box.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Chris interpreted answers, and was assisted by medium Chip Coffey.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Many of the attendees had never heard of the box, and most of them\n&gt;&gt;&gt; had never seen it in operation, and it caused quite a stir.   Chris\n&gt;&gt;&gt; also took the box into one of the hotel&#39;s more active haunted rooms,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; as part of the featured ghost investigations.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; There were two other boxes present on site for part of the time,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; owned by Randy Schneider and Bill Murphy.  Fortunately, these boxes\n&gt;&gt;&gt; were not pressed into service for paranormal tap dancing.  I was\n&gt;&gt;&gt; especially happy to be able to participate in small group private\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sessions with both Randy and Bill (and one of which included Mark),\n&gt;&gt;&gt; which I found far more illuminating.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; One article concerns the controversy over the box (for example,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; should it be used in haunted places to provoke ghosts; can it  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; dial up\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the dead on demand), and the other is a Q&A interview I did with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Frank.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally, I agree with Frank&#39;s vision for the box as an ITC tool.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Rosemary Ellen Guiley\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt;&gt; Hotmail to go?
