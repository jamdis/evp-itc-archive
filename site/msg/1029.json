Ive learned my way around computers \nover the years, but this is too weird and it definnitly corresponds \nto how much Im progressing with the contacts I am trying to maintain. \nAsking it to stop seems to invite worse. This interference has (I \nsuspect) an intent and Ive found that the best fix is ignoring this \nstuff...in any case..Its good to know Im not the only one whos gone \nthrough this....so gathering my dignity...anyone here know if theres \nany reason to be concerned about EMF levels? I sure am getting mild \nflu like symptoms fairly regularly...used to be &quot;not so mild&quot;\n&gt; Light,\n&gt; monki\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; \nwrote:                                  \n&gt; Not uncommon in this work Monki. If ya lived close enough I could \nfix it for ya but not sure where on the east coast you are residing \n(yes guys I can fix pc&#39;s LOL =P but no that doesnt make me the tech \ntype...practice makes perfect). I went thru two computers in a months \ntime, fried everything completely right down to the last chip. \nAppliances dont last long at my house (near me) and tv&#39;s, vcr&#39;s, \nbackups units...u name it I have fried it. It finally stopped when I \nasked them to stop whatever they were doing that was putting so much \npressure on my machinery. Now they say Otto is in charge of \nequipment, and havent had much problems on my end. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Email weirdness is also common I have watched mine and others \nemails disappear, then sometimes show up later with changes made in \nthe wording of the message. Retro Dave has bore the brunt of the \nemail problems LOL I just had it happen once when I responded to his \npostings of having problems.  My post disappeared then came back \nchanged/edited. Thats been a long time ago tho. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   After saying all that you should of course check the basics, make \nsure everything is plugged up properly, see if anything feels \nextremely hot (if it is shut it down immediately to cool) then ya may \nwanna pop the lid off the tower of the pc to check inside and remove \nthe sound card, clean the contacts, then replace it to see if that \nhelps. UNPLUG IT FROM ELECTRIC FIRST! If that doesnt help then you \nmay need to replace the part. Keep an eye on temperatures if \nsomething is running hot sometimes it will cause the metal to \nswell/bend/melt/move.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; monki rei &lt;monkiintherabbithole@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;       Hey,\n&gt; I am having an unbelievable time with fried equipment. Now my sound \nis blown! No speakers or headphones work. I heard a pop and then\n(silence is not always golden for us evp types!) I have been through \nalot of hardware this month! Thats not mentioning screwed up \nsoftware, digital recorders and sound files and emails that just seem \nto go missing! I hear from other researchers that this is not \nuncommon.Im losing stuff quickly. Ill be outta business before long! \nIs there a safeguard for this? Anyone had these things happen to them?\n&gt; Ive wondered if emf protection might be in order...I hope I dont \nsound completely madd!(besides, its the Madd Hatter thats got that \ncovered.
