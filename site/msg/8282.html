<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Steve,

the wav file has a cue list embedded into it, consisting of 72 cues - one for each allophone. If EVPmaker is set up to use the embedded cue list, the other settings such as Overlap, Zerocross, Crossfade, Segment size etc. don&#x27;t apply, thus they will be greyed out. These options, and the &quot;Use Cue List&quot; option, exclude each other. If &quot;Use Cue List&quot; should be greyed out, then uncheck the other options.

Stefan

&gt; Stefan,
&gt; 
&gt; That&#x27;s a great file, i&#x27;m going to do a test session with that today.  
&gt; Hopefully i&#x27;ll get some good stuff, how did you have EVPmaker set.  
&gt; Such as (overlap, z-cross,x-fade) and the number settings.  I&#x27;m going 
&gt; to test out different ones, but was curious of how you set it up.
&gt;
