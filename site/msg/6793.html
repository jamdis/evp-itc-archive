&gt; Not sure about an MP3 player on my computer but I have MS Media  
&gt; Center and Windows Media Player to handle music etc.  Don&#x27;t know  
&gt; much more about how to handle your MP3 files.  I suppose your apple  
&gt; is more sophisticated.  If others are opening your file I would  
&gt; think I should be able to also.
&gt;
&gt; I just checked another member&#x27;s file and I was able to open and  
&gt; listen to her MP3 file.  So something else is up with you and me.   
&gt; Also, you had sent me a file via personal email and I am able to  
&gt; open and listen to it.  Will keep trying.   Ron L
