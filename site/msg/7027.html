<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The person who began the issue with an offensive comment of her own  
comment ought not to be the one suspending Bruce for responding to  
it. My opinion. Your milage may vary.

Misty, this is a decision for a list owner. I think that is you and  
no longer Frank.

&gt; Jeff,
&gt;
&gt; Mind your buisness and go back to the kiddie table.
&gt; your not supposed to get involved in real peoples conversations.
&gt;
&gt; before you open your mouth read the post that this post was in  
&gt; reply too.
&gt; who are you to suggest anything, when was the last time anybody
&gt; saw any research or files from you? OOPS I forget nobody EVER did.
&gt;
&gt; Stop sticking your mouth where it does not belong.

&gt; Bruce,

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; That lost comment was uncalled for and extremely rude.  If you want  
&gt; to make comments like that then I suggest you make it offline in  
&gt; private email.

&gt;
&gt; First off the reason I got a new box From Frank is because he  
&gt; recognises that
&gt; I am a serious researcher, It does not have anything to do with  
&gt; being a man
&gt; or woman. It has to do with being deserving of a Frank&#x27;s box and  
&gt; evidently!
&gt;
&gt; Well do I have to spell it out? Start putting some time into your  
&gt; research instead of
&gt; taking tantrums and maybe someday you&#x27;ll have a Frank&#x27;s box, But I  
&gt; doubt it!

&gt; hey guy&#x27;s
&gt;
&gt; I have been lucky enough to not only have Frank&#x27;s box #12 but now  
&gt; Frank
&gt; has gifted me with a brand new box #29.
&gt;
&gt; Here are the first files to come out of it. And it has not even been
&gt; imprinted by mike and lisa yet. These files are from the first 30
&gt; seconds of the first session.
&gt;
&gt; let me know what you think.
