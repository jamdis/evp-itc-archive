<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce, and Jeremy too!  Essentially, we are in agreement and share a similar moral 
philosophy, despite my posts defending the rights of others to take advantage of the 
market (even if I don&#x27;t like it).  ;-)

My main concern, and difference of opinion, is with your assertion, Bruce, that these units 
(sold by price gouging people - no disagreement there) will come with the &quot;wrong energy 
attached to them.&quot;  I&#x27;m perfectly happy to agree to disagree on this aspect of the topic at 
hand, and I think others are perfectly capable of making up their own minds on what they 
think, now that different points of view are on the table for consideration.

There are some people who are very black and white when it comes to the topic of making 
money in the paranormal field.  This is why I posed the questions to you both about Ron 
and shared the story of my friend.  I am not one of the people in the black and white 
camp.  Jeremy, it appears that you are, and you are not alone, that&#x27;s for sure.  I believe in 
people&#x27;s right to profit in the field, but I absolutely wish to see it be done in a fair and 
honorable manner.  That being said, I also have respect for those in the black and white 
camp, and I can even understand where you are coming from.

I don&#x27;t know Ron personally, but I can tell you in another forum when the erroneous 
assumption was made that he was price gouging, I similarly stated my views about his 
right to profit from the sale of a quality product, which performs as stated.  I understand 
it&#x27;s not much profit, as he does specify on his site that he sells these units for &quot;close to 
actual cost&quot; (so Bruce, I&#x27;m not under the same impression he is selling at a loss.)  As well, 
he states that the soon to be released MaxiBox will be intended for the experienced users, 
and the MiniBox will remain in production as the standard system, implying it is an entry 
level unit.  Hopefully, as is often the case, production costs can eventually be reduced.

Similarly, I do not know Chris.  If he is, as I&#x27;ve read others claim - &quot;less than&quot; he presents 
himself to be, and falls short in terms of services offered - than certainly his practices 
would fall somewhere near, or even well within, the realm of charlatanism and I have 
already expressed my distain for this type of behavior.  

My closing wish is this:  May those who are interested in obtaining a commercially 
available &#x27;ghost box&#x27; (of whatever flavor), be blessed with one coming into their lives, 
either by gift or by purchasing one at a fair price.  

Thanks for the discussion, guys.  I appreciate it.  

Margaret

&gt; Margaret,
&gt;  
&gt; Ron Is a friend and these comments where not directed toward him.
&gt; I also own a mini box and am happy with it.
&gt;  
&gt; The difference is, when the minibox was introduced for sale at 399.00 which is what I 
paid.
&gt; You could not obtain one any cheaper and Ron was not trying to exploit the needs and 
desires of &quot;new&quot; researchers
&gt; in the field. If I&#x27;m not mistaken he has repeatedly said that the minibox was primarily 
meant for experienced researchers and 
&gt; paranormal investigating teams. And I believe he actually took a loss on the minibox.
&gt;  
&gt; On the other hand what you have on ebay are unscrupulous individuals who see that 
they can pick up an item for 24.99
&gt; open it and cut a wire which takes about ten seconds from beginning to end. and then 
double the price plus shipping.
&gt;  
&gt; There is a name for it, I believe it is PRICE GOUGING when there is a short or none 
existent supply of something and 
&gt; there are people or companies that hold some pieces of the product and sell it at 
inflated prices to unwary individuals that feel a need to have it.
&gt;  
&gt; In my book they are no more than thieves without guns. And should never be patronised 
no matter what the circumstances.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Bruce. That&#x27;s wonderful your are in a financial position to be so generous. :-) I don&#x27;t 
know if we can really go so far as to say that people who buy from eBay are receiving units 
with the wrong kind of energy attached, just because profiting from sales isn&#x27;t a course of 
action you or I, nor some others would take. If that is the case, where do we draw the line? 
I paid a hefty price for my MiniBox, as have many others. I&#x27;m sure there is some profit 
involved there. The energy of it seems just fine to me and I hold no disregard toward Ron 
for recognizing there is a market for his devices.Perhaps those who log onto eBay looking 
to find something so they can experiment with automated sweep feel it&#x27;s their lucky day 
when they discover such a listing? Maybe they even feel it&#x27;s a &#x27;sign&#x27; that it&#x27;s the right thing 
for them to do some research. And as far as the seller is concerned, we don&#x27;t know what 
their attitude or motivation is, unless we know them personally. Reminds me of a person 
on the cleaning crew who used to steal the food from the fridge at one of my corporate 
jobs. Everyone was so harsh and judgmental about it, until one day, we learned she was 
feeding her hungry children!Even if the person selling the units is the most greedy person 
in the world, I fully believe it is far more the attitude and intention of the person 
conducting the experiments which influence the energy of communication devices, than 
the attitude of the people selling the devices. It&#x27;s my opinion WE are the ones who attract 
what comes through to us on our equipment, much more so than the equipment itself.

the research we love and the equipment we use.&gt; &gt; I have given away including the 
shipping 5 RS boxes for free, 4, 470&#x27;s and 1 469 all hacked by me.&gt; I did not do it to gain 
popularity or even wanted a thank you. my sole motivation was to bring new people into 
the research and &gt; in turn change someones life and perpetuate the idea of strength in 
numbers, in this case strength of communication.&gt; &gt; To all new people on this board, do 
not patronise these wolves that prey on the needs and wants of others. &gt; The RS 20 -125 
is everything the 470 &amp; 469 are and a little more. do not let the size or complicated button 
arrangement scare you off.&gt; the hack is as simple as the others. &gt; &gt; Do not buy any RS 
hacks from ebay, they are sold with the wrong energy attached to them, spirit wise.&gt; That 
is why I and all other researchers should follow the example of a great man to whom we 
owe all of this research.&gt; Mr. Frank Sumption, who was in a position at one time to make 
a substantial amount of money from his boxes and&gt; was offered the opportunity on a 
silver platter. But chose to follow what had been asked of him by higher entities.&gt; And 
that was to keep the research pure for research sake. And that at no time was this 
equipment or knowledge there of&gt; to be for monetary gain.&gt; &gt; I adhere to this promise 
made by Frank to our friends on the other side and feel that there is no need to give in to 
these box &gt; extortionists. If a box is not attainable for a new person yet, the right way. 
Then it probably is not their time yet.&gt; &gt; I have coined a phrase and believe in it. &quot;The 
researcher does not choose the box, the box chooses the researcher&quot;&gt; Be patient, those 
that do not yet have a box. We will do all we can to help you obtain one.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; Bruce

I just took a look at eBay and these are the NEW 12-469&#x27;s. Well, all I can say is the market 
is driven by BUYERS. If people are willing to pay, you can&#x27;t fault the person selling for 
taking advantage of what the market will bear. Perhaps the people who do not have the 
tools, or the skills, to do their own hack, feel this price is reasonable?Margaret--- In EVP-
