If you taking a look at the posts from the weekend, there is nothing but mud slinging and disrespect directed towards our research.  The conversations were in no way even a heathly debate.  It&#39;s ok to disagree and be opened minded, but sometimes some people you just have to shake you head and walk away.  No matter what you say your response will never be right in their eyes.  \n   \n  I joinned this group over almost 2 years ago.  I have watched, listened and learned from many.  I have observed those who in my opinion have taked advantage of Frank as well as the others and had nothing but selfish movities on their agenda.  I have seen people BEG for boxes, have threated people via email and telephone, to the point where it has been come hate towards what we are doing.  \n   \n  I have stayed slient regarding this for a long while, and its about time that if you can not be professional, curtious, and serious about what we are all doing here as a whole, THEN DON&#39;T LET THE DOOR HIT YOU IN THE ASS!\n   \n  See regardless whether we post to this board or not, those who will continue the work will always be in contact and be dedicated to this work no matter what!\n   \n  Juli\n   \n   \n   \n             \n\nLisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n          Bruce,  \n\n  Please breathe and relax. You&#39;re very stressed today, obviously. How can so few and little flames mean anything to someone who has been through the terrible fires that you have? You matter here and your help is invaluable. You are also our friend and would be terribly missed here.\n  \n\n  Peace and affection,\n  \n\n  Ann\n  \n\n  \n\n      On Jan 21, 2008, at 5:58 PM, bhali333 wrote:\n\n          Fellow researchers,\n\nI have decided to back away from participating in this group for a \nwhile.
