I am  worried that he is going to push Frank to far and Frank will not be h=
ere anymore
THAT IS WHAT I AM AFRAID OF... And he is the most important per=
son here.
It's his group....and if he gets mad enough he will end it, and t=

I realize you have plenty of subject=

 looking for something a little more objective and less subject to influenc=
e and interpretations.

And stop putting words in my mouth. A person can mi=
sinterpret something, mistake something, or confuse something, without lyin=
g about something.  And before you jump down my throat claiming I am saying=
 all results are mistakes, I am not.  I am performing experiments, keeping =
an open mind, and considering all evidence I find.

The way you have been a=
ttacking me by calling me names at every turn, just because I try new thing=
s and don't always agree with your world view, is eerily reminiscent of the=
 way the church of old tried to suppress new thought and discoveries, excep=
t you're just substituting the word 'heretic' with 'science'. and 'blasphem=
y' with anything that disagrees with you.

There's an old saying:  "We beco=
me that which we hate".  So far, all you've done is denounce people's effor=
ts to try new methods and see what works.  You accept nothing anyone else p=
roposes if it does not agree with you.  That is the realm of the extreme sk=
eptic: the same skeptic you ridicule.

You certainly don't have to agree wi=
th my comments.  And I don't have to agree with yours.  But no one needs al=
l the name calling Frank.   It really adds nothing to support your theories=
.

I don't think I have enough data yet to make any conclusions, s=

 what the box or the recorders can do, I try to make different distinct exp=
eriments for each.

Some people claim they can get the box to tell them thi=
ngs that the operator couldn't know, so my "whats the object" experiment is=
 one way to examine that.  Some people claim the boxes can make predictions=
, so cataloging predictions and examining the results can help examine that=
.  If there are other claims, I will try to figure experiments based on tho=
