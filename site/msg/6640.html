<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Fair enough, i don&#x27;t think anybody is going to hear what we hear 
though unless they have been using the same boxes we have for the 
same amount of time.  Yeah, i&#x27;ve noticed that some of my files are 
good to me and say stuff that&#x27;s clear, but than i go back the next 
day and i don&#x27;t even hear it at all anymore.  Doing the unlabeled 
files project shows that nobody hears the same as the next 
researcher.  We just have to keep pushing on until we can get clear 
communication, which i don&#x27;t believe any of us have got yet.  But i 
do believe this is still moving forward.  Juli and i had a fantastic 
Frank&#x27;s box session on Skype yesterday in the AM Random mode, which 
now works.  And, we talked and had pretty clear communication for 
about a half hour with the box.  So, we hear pretty much the same as 
each other, well we did yesterday anyway.

&gt; Steve,
&gt;  
&gt; You and I  have never really agreed on what constitutes a good file.
&gt; I would say besides the ones that say a simple yes or no, I don&#x27;t 
hear any of yours either.
&gt; thats kind of funny. Maybe they want it that way? (no disrespect) 
We have had our differences 
&gt; but that aside I consider you an excellent researcher and value 
your profesional opinion.
&gt;  
&gt; So please if we can comment objectively on each others files and 
not let personal crap get in the way.
&gt; By all means.

&gt; I like the personal audio clips too. However, the fact is for those 
who don&#x27;t check their e-mail all day long and when they get home they 
have 80 e-mails and 50 of them are just announcements to files. I do 
listen to them also and enjoy it, but maybe we can limit the files to 
a few instead of a lot at one time. It also seems like the board 
freed up a lot of space as well, so people can start posting on this 
board again. The e-snips thing is cool, but it&#x27;s better all on the 
same board and i think the space is available now to do that. I 
personally listened to all your posts Bruce and so did a lot of 
others i&#x27;m sure. Maybe there wasn&#x27;t a lot in that batch to comment on 
for people. Some you hear and some you don&#x27;t, i personally don&#x27;t hear 
a lot of what you post with no disrespect. Do you want 200 people 
responding &quot;I didn&#x27;t hear that&quot; to some of the files or &quot;Yeah Good 
One&quot;. I can make out other files only if you label them and i&#x27;m 
waiting for the file to say that and i think you proved that with 
your experiment with unlabeled files that no one got the right answer 
to. The fact is people hear different things all the time.Your files 
sound very much like traditional EVP and are hard to make out 
sometimes, but sometimes you hit on some good ones too. You have 
stated in a personal e-mail to not respond to any of your files, and 
i&#x27;ve honored your request but if you allow me to comment on the files 
you post i will. It seems there are only a couple that respond to 
files here, but i&#x27;m sure others listen as well and don&#x27;t comment. I 
will be more than happy to add to to the group discussions on your 
files, but the couple people that always respond to your files have 
nothing but praise and i disagree sometimes.-Steve H. --- In EVP-

Bruce, &gt; I have to agree with you. Given the file folder shortage, I 
deleted all of my files to give the new comers room. I hated to do 
that, given if anyone wanted to revert back to my clips, they could 
in fact do so and now that can&#x27;t. I also hate to have to send someone 
a link to find my audio on an additional sight. &gt; &gt; Maybe we could 
comprise and say after &quot;x&quot; amount of days, upon new files being 
uploaded we could clean house? I know that not everyone will take it 
upon themselves to do this, but if they don&#x27;t (after an announcement 
from the groups caretakers), if they disappear, its their own fault.&gt; 
&gt; I personally like the single emails announcing each file. I can go 
straight to the audio clip and not have to search through previous 
clips I have already listened to. &gt; &gt; Just my thoughts!&gt; Juli &gt; &gt;

post some files so I posted to a sub folder of &gt; my main folder in 
the files section.&gt; I noticed that some people voiced their dislike 
of sending post notices &gt; for every file , so I sent none. Just a 
single post stating that I had &gt; posted the files and where they 
could be found.&gt; &gt; Now this is the dilemma, If you do not post an 
announcement for each &gt; file and you trust that the single post 
announcing all the files that &gt; have been posted will suffice, well I 
don&#x27;t think so!&gt; &gt; I know that most individuals here do not listen to 
or reply to every &gt; single file posted but I will usually get some 
comments on the better &gt; or more interesting ones. So far from the 
posting yesterday &quot;NADA&quot;&gt; &gt; If anyone saw the post I wrote announcing 
the files I posted to the &gt; files section, please for my own 
satisfaction let me know.&gt; &gt; Otherwise I don&#x27;t think the one post 
notice thing is gonna cut it!&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The contents of
