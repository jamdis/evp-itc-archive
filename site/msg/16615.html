<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Go to the files section and look in the Tom&#x27;s Tube folder.  Somehow the notice of them being uploaded to the site didnt get to the message board.

&gt; &gt; FINALLY! I got audacity working and processed my 1/19/10 session with my &quot;Tom&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; Tube&quot; ghostbox
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was quite impressed, if I say so myself. Cant vouch for their authenticity
&gt; &gt; though, as I could not hear the questions and the requests I asked. The voices
&gt; &gt; sound quite plain and do not seem to be a snatch of radio sound--as I can hear
&gt; &gt; the scans in the background.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; One seems to say &quot;Its Oh for naught&quot; and someething else at the end of it. The
&gt; &gt; other file seems to say &quot;get down&quot; in a fast faint voice near the beginning,
&gt; &gt; followed by a louder &quot;he was like 40&quot;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Im gonna have to put an external mike on the other recorder channel so I can
&gt; &gt; hear what I am saying and get some context to better interpret the validity of
&gt; &gt; the message (radio or paranormal)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That 25 inch long , 2 inch pipe that I use for a resonator seems to be very
&gt; &gt; effective.
