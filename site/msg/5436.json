Works SOoooo much better than \nwhat I had plugged in! Also, tried a different type of tape; was using \nMaxwell XL II 90, Memorex DB 60, TDK D 90 type I, and now have TDK SA \n90 High Bias type II.  This last one seems to work better. Recorded \nsome clear &quot;voices&quot; + one that said, &quot;I love you, MoM!&quot; Don&#39;t know who \nthat was! Hmmm?! Also, tried to contact John Lennon and it seemed as \nthough he got annoyed at another entity blocking him, one even \nsaid, &quot;Take your time.&quot; as I heard him say, &quot;Jam it!!&quot;  I wonder IF \nthis is something he said while alive on Earth???  Wild stuff! 8-)      \n=Judy=\n&gt;"}
