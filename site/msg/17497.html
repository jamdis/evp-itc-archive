&gt; Thanks.

&gt; I have found that they do talk among themselves all the time. A lot of the
&gt; time, they are talking about me like I am not even there. In some of those
&gt; clips, you can definitely hear them talking amongst themselves.
&gt;
&gt; The main voice you hear (especially in clip 4) is my technician, or as I
&gt; call him, my facilitator. He is the one telling Raudive to ask his question
&gt; and telling an Other to wait. I have numerous clips where I will ask a
&gt; question and I can hear him ask the same question of the Others. This is all
&gt; the personal proof I need (besides my name and facts about my life coming
&gt; through a broken radio). To hear your own words coming through the radio in
&gt; a different voice is something that should be considered impossible...but
&gt; then to get an answer back from those reiterated words, well, I consider
&gt; that pretty damn good evidence that there is an intelligence trying to
&gt; communicate.
&gt;
&gt; But then again, any scientist can easily say that I was experiencing
&gt; nothing more that a Ham radio operator having fun at my expense. My only
&gt; come back to this is that since I still a ghost hunter, I have traveled
&gt; extensively to different locations. I have been bringing my box out in to
&gt; the field for location experiments. Guess what? My facilitator speaks in
&gt; every spot, in every state that I have tried this in.

&gt; &gt; Hi Tim,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for sharing your files - I heard a lot of different names in your
&gt; clips Nos. 1-3, including the names Tim, Mark, and Steve; in clip No. 2,
&gt; sounded like they&#x27;re mostly talking among themselves. In No. 1, I heard
&gt; &quot;This is Tim ... what is that... enough power.... settled.&quot; Nos. 4 and 5 are
&gt; very clear - heard what you heard.
