The monitor person asks the questions and the replies come.  Should I ask the question myself, however, the conduit shuts.  It IS interesting though, I can ask questions indirectly, staying in declaritive mode, by saying to my monitor something like &quot;ask me to look at the flag or ask me what color is his coat---The monitor asks and THEN I get my answer--I stay concious, but with a slight &quot;buzz&quot; and often the info does not go to my long term memory. \n\nMy suggestions on how the boxes work are based on my own years of experience with random viewing fields.  once it became obvious how THEY worked, it was a simple thing to see the correspondence with audio factor in boxes.  One thing the boxes have taught me, however, is that it is NOT &quot;all in the head&quot; as these sound files can be shared with others.---This is making me rethink that my VIDEO random feild stuff may also not be &quot;in the head, and perhaps may be captured on imagery. \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  You&#39;re making alot of presumptuous statements that have no basis in fact.\n&gt; You&#39;re just jealous cuz you can&#39;t hear the boxes. I don&#39;t need any noise to\n&gt; hear spirits, and I do just fine seeing through the third eye. It&#39;s just\n&gt; that same old skeptic BS that it&#39;s all in the brain.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Jan 23, 2010 at 6:54 PM, Tom &lt;Tom_Ray@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The random sounds make it easier to hear spirit voices in your head. I\n&gt; &gt; discovered this effect VISUALLY staining at rsndom dots on a viewing screen.\n&gt; &gt; In the visual mode the spirit only has to suppress the light spots and\n&gt; &gt; enhance the dark spots that do not match the image it is sending----Light\n&gt; &gt; and dark spots on the screen that correspond to the image dont have to be\n&gt; &gt; modulated at all---the result is a SAVING of &quot;psychic energy&quot; on the\n&gt; &gt; observers part, perhaps not much, but enough to make the difference between\n&gt; &gt; seeing and NOT seeing, however. Random sound would work the same way only\n&gt; &gt; the frequencies that did not match the sounds being sent would have to be\n&gt; &gt; blocked or replaced, the frequencies already present would NOT have to be\n&gt; &gt; modulated--so SOME energy is saved and not as much effort is needed to hear\n&gt; &gt; the entity. Effectively enhancing one&#39;s innate abilities. It a lot easier to\n&gt; &gt; hear a spirit sound if some of the waves are already in place, than it would\n&gt; &gt; be if you had to build the entire word from scratch.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Jill&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;jjkamp@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That doesn&#39;t surprise me at all. I wish someone could figure out why\n&gt; &gt; using the box enhances one&#39;s abilities as a medium, but apparently this is\n&gt; &gt; so -- I know it was true for me. As much experience as you have, Frank, it\n&gt; &gt; would seem to follow you&#39;d have built up some considerable ability.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Frank\n&gt; &gt; Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Went to the medium development class last night and OMG!
