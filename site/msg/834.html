<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>HI Guy, Welcome to the group! Your expertise will be valuable I am 
sure.
I am also a memeber of AAEVP and I have been researching EVP&#x27;s and 
DVR for several years now. I have come along way in my research and 
Know of Dave and Frank and I believe they are serious and great 
contibutors to research in this area of communication.  I am also a 
member on the experimentors team at ITCBRIDGE.com  We are currently 
looking for serious people to help in creating a bridge among our 
group and to go to a frequency and record live the communications  
to set questions for a limited time frame. If you or anyone might be 
interested you may add me and Texas frank from ITC Bridge from yahoo 
to your list. We are wanting to set up a conference thru yahoo, and 
discuss the plan. Please let me state that we need harmony and 
people with a good set of ethics and morals to build this bridge for 
contact and are willing to conribute their time and their essence 
for higher levels of contact.  Blessings All.   Laura

&gt; 
&gt; The Intelligence Project 
&gt; 
&gt; A Project involving EVP and Listening
&gt; 
&gt; If you have done EVP for a while you will already know whether or 
&gt; not what you say is responded to sometimes - you will already know 
&gt; if there seems to be some sort of awareness there.
&gt; 
&gt; You may believe this to be so, and so may I, but the world in 
&gt; general will just take this as further evidence of 
&gt; our &quot;deteriorating mental ability&quot;!
&gt; 
&gt; You can&#x27;t prove anything - all you can do is state your firm 
belief 
&gt; and perhaps back that up with some examples which you hope don&#x27;t 
&gt; sound too &quot;made-up&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; This project aims to deal with that situation once and for all.  
We 
&gt; believe in working with science rather than against it.  Science 
is 
&gt; not our enemy, nor indeed is scepticism.
&gt; 
&gt; Method
&gt; What we want to find out is if there is any relationship between 
&gt; what the experimenter says and the type of EVP responses that we 
get.
&gt; 
&gt; We are looking for signs of intelligence.
&gt; 
&gt; We want to do that in a measurable way - for that is the way of 
&gt; science.  And this is the way that has been approved by a major 
&gt; European pharmaceutical company for funding.
&gt; 
&gt; We have six questions. These questions are decided on in advance.  
&gt; 
&gt; During the experiment the experimenter asks each of the questions, 
&gt; in turn, with a 30-second gap after each question to allow any 
&gt; responses to be recorded. 
&gt; 
&gt; So (for example) what you would get is,
&gt; 
&gt; Question &#x27;What is the time?&#x27; 
&gt; [30 seconds delay]; 
&gt; Question &#x27;What is your name?&#x27; 
&gt; [30 seconds delay], 
&gt; Question &#x27;What do you like best?&#x27;
&gt; [30 second delay]
&gt; and so on.
&gt; 
&gt; Now if an utterance is heard within the 30-second period and if 
the 
&gt; utterance sounds as though it could be a response to the question, 
&gt; then it is treated as an actual response.  For example if we hear 
&gt; the utterance &#x27;John Smith&#x27; seven seconds after the question &#x27;What 
is 
&gt; your name?&#x27; is asked, then that looks like a response to that 
&gt; question.
&gt; 
&gt; The experimenter carries out the session, asking each of the 
&gt; questions in turn; and then the recording of the session is turned 
&gt; over to a speech analyst.
&gt; 
&gt; The analyst picks out from the general background noise all the 
&gt; utterances he can find in the recording.  He refines his search 
&gt; still further by selecting out the 16 utterances of the best 
&gt; quality. (sometimes it will be less than 16), and &quot;shuffles&quot; these 
&gt; so that you will not know which came first, which came second and 
so 
&gt; on.
&gt; 
&gt; The final 16 utterances, their order shuffled, are sent out to you.
&gt; 
&gt; What you are asked to do is decide if any of the utterances could 
be 
&gt; a response to any of the questions, and to fill in a table like 
that 
&gt; shown in the example below.
&gt; 
&gt; Track No.	Could be a response to Question Number..
&gt; BR01	                               4
&gt; BR02	                               0
&gt; BR03	                               0
&gt; BRO4	                               3
&gt; BR05	                               1
&gt; BR06	                               2
&gt; BR07	                               3
&gt; BRO8	                               3
&gt; BR09	                               6
&gt; BR10	                               0
&gt; BR11	                               0
&gt; BR12	                               0
&gt; BR13	                               6
&gt; BR14	                               5
&gt; BR15	                               0
&gt; BR16	                               0
&gt;  
&gt; As you can see some utterances are not considered to be a response 
&gt; to any of the questions, and so a &#x27;0&#x27; is inserted at that point.  
&gt; This is not an easy test, that is why you are being asked to help.
&gt; 
&gt; Please send your results to XXX@... and then they will get put 
&gt; into our database - and in time we will be told the results.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, however, preliminary results look quite promising  and 
&gt; your assistance on this vital project is very much appreciated!
