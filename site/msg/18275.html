&gt; I have an old Aiwa it has two large stand alone speakers, it was down
&gt; stairs for a long time, I got discourage because the dog chewed the plug end
&gt; and i just left it down there, it&#x27;s got wet, being down there for couple
&gt; years, I just got it upstairs, i would like to see if i could fix it, but
&gt; don&#x27;t know how, where can i buy a new electric cord for it?  Are they easy
&gt; to fix?  Anyone of you want to take it and make a ghost box out of it for
&gt; me?  It&#x27;s kind of big, so I don&#x27;t know what shipping charges might cost.
&gt; Wish I had got it up stairs long time ago, oh well. sf
