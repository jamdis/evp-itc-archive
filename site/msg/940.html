<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Your so right Frank. The general public has a fixation with the &#x27;scary&#x27;, this is being exploited and promoted. There are so many ghost hunting web sites. I don&#x27;t like the trend, it&#x27;s like expanding knowledge and understanding is too boring or something.

Yeah, it&#x27;s hard to explain. I see the focus in &quot;ghost hunting&quot; on the 
negative, seems like it has to be scary to appeal to the public, that&#x27;s the 
first thing I don&#x27;t like. Then there&#x27;s the aspect of huntiing, like they are 
after subhuman animals, or something. Then there&#x27;s the implication that one 
has to go to &quot;huanted locations&quot; to do research. You get much better 
contacts form higher spirits if you stay home. Then there&#x27;s the Hollywood 
take over of ghost/itc research I don&#x27;t like.
