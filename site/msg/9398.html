Michael Arrington
55 comments 

Hollywood super producer Steven Spielberg is preparing to launch a new
social network, we&#x27;ve heard from multiple sources. The focus will be
on users who&#x27;ve had or who are interested in sharing paranormal and
extraterrestrial experiences. The new social network may also have
original video content investigating alleged ghost and UFO stories.

Spielberg has always had a love for ghost and UFO stories. His movies
include Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Poltergeist (1982),
E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Casper (1995), Men in Black
(1997), The Haunting (1999), War of the Worlds (2005) and the upcoming
Interstellar (2009). His first movie, at 16, was a 140-minute science
fiction adventure called Firelight (which later inspired Close
Encounters). Add to those titles a score of other sci-fi movies.

Spielberg has apparently had at least one paranormal experience
himself. There are stories of him staying in a hotel called Excelsior
House and being so frightened by ghosts that he fled the room and
moved 20 miles away. We&#x27;ve also heard anecdotes about Spielberg seeing
the ghost of a dead relative repeatedly as a child. Whether based in
reality or the product of an exceptional imagination, these
experiences may have had an impact on his life&#x27;s work and this
upcoming social network.

The project may have originally been associated with Yahoo but the
project was killed off before launch. But if our sources are right,
the idea has lived on and a team in Los Angeles is working to launch
it in the next few months.</pre>
