<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, used to really love the heat, we used to go to Lake Powell 
every year in July, and I&#x27;d stay naked the whole week--sunburn--
major. Since we got into our fifties, the heat got to be too much 
though. That desire to bodily free seems to go with spirituality, and 
I&#x27;ve heard from many in this field that don&#x27;t like clothes. There is 
a definate change in the aura with no clothes.

nude!!??

&gt; are able to use it and pick out and transmit the words and stuff in 
&gt; the English language.
