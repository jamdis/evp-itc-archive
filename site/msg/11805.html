<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi, (Im new to the group)
No actual plans as yet, but have the concept in mind that Im going to 
work into a device. Maybe this will help somewhat...
1. Speakjet chip and suitable audio amp.
2. PIC microcontroller, configured to talk to Speakjet serial port at 
9600 baud, including baud sync and flow control feedback from SJ.
3. An array of &quot;speak&quot; (ascii)commands programmed into PIC to initiate 
outputting of all specific allophones, as per the Speakjet datasheet.
4. External sensor of some form (perhaps EMF) that is able to act as 
environmental trigger for allophone speaking.
5.PIC sub-routine to allow PIC to read and digitize the sensor analog 
output via the PIC&#x27;s A/D input(s).
6 PIC sub-routine to link incoming sensor data to the selection of 
allophone output, depending on sensor level thresholds, etc and perhaps 
a random selection process.

There is a Yahoo group dedicated to the Speakjet chip, but it wont be 
of much help in this case. The core work is in the PIC programming.

Think thats about it for now. Hope this helps.
regards from &quot;down under&quot;,
JEFF
