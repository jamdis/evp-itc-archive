It&#39;s similar to what you \n&gt; have listed except it has both a regular audio microphone and the \nemf \n&gt; pickup device, all in one amplified device.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is the How-To stuff.:\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a way to make a combined induction and audio amplified \n&gt; microphone that you can listen LIVE while you&#39;re recording.\n&gt; Using this device you can now search for audio EVPs with the \nregular \n&gt; microphone and other type energy EVP/ITC with the induction device, \n&gt; both at the same time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the link to the exact page:\n&gt; http://www.ufogeek.com/prototypes/prototypespage10.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s a link to page 1:\n&gt; http://www.ufogeek.com/prototypes/\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike C.

I just tried it with the mic  jack \non \n&gt; my frank&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; box and got some interesting results.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Just something to think about,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ____________________________________\n&gt; &gt;  Life should be easier.
