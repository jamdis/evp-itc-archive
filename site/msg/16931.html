<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, I listened and commented a couple of days ago, too, but my comment somehow didn&#x27;t make it to the board.  So you have more people listening than you think.  ;-)

&gt;  I do have to do more cinsistent seesions to get more. I tend to only record when I&#x27;m testing a system. 
&gt; 
&gt;  Thanks for taking the time to listen!

&gt; &gt; Frank,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I listened carefully to the Rosetta Stone ad fragment you posted and found it interesting.
&gt; &gt; The final word clearly comes from another source as it is another voice. This suggests 
&gt; &gt; that what may be happening has more to do with controlling the sequence rather than 
&gt; &gt; manipulating the audio directly. This was an interesting fragment since you know what 
&gt; &gt; to expectas it comes from a well-known source.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That observation leads me to wonder if there are any other high-quality samples which 
&gt; &gt; would lead us to another conclusion. In other words, are there any good examples that
&gt; &gt; sound more like there ismanipulationofintended words rather thansplicing?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For instance, let&#x27;s say we knew a phrase was &#x27;world&#x27;s leading language software&#x27;. And 
&gt; &gt; we normally heard that phrase in a single voice. If we heard that phrase with the last
&gt; &gt; word changed to &#x27;hardware&#x27; in the same voice, that would suggest actual phonetic 
&gt; &gt; manipulation. Somy question: is there any good evidence of that sort of manipulation?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I keep using the phrase &#x27;good evidence&#x27; to mean high quality sound that is easily
&gt; &gt; understood without having to strain one&#x27;s ears. The sample you gave in this
&gt; &gt; case is for me a good example of what I am calling good or high-quality evidence.
