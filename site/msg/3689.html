Below is a copy of an email exchange I had with Rick Moran, along 
with his reply...

Hi Rick,

I finally got a chance to listen to one of the responses from Ron&#x27;s 
MiniBox. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve heard it, but for context sake here&#x27;s a copy 
of a reply from the MiniBox which April posted on the EVP-ITC Yahoo 
group, that came through at the Stanley -

http://www.filecrunch.com/file/~wlrn97

All I heard at first was jibberish... Then, after listening and 
considering it, what I slammed into my mind loud and clear is, &quot;Prey 
on your own... Don&#x27;t you.&quot;

Pretty apt for those activily involved as researchers in this 
Twilight Zone of the paranormal, eh? LOL!

I&#x27;m amazed by the test results so far, and I&#x27;m very pleased to say 
Ron&#x27;s sending me an invoice and I&#x27;ll be purchasing one ASAP!

George Noory is suppose to be interviewing Rosemary Ellen Guiley on 
Coast To Coast AM this coming week, but when I just checked the only 
available night is Wednesday and it says TBA. Since I listen to Coast 
all the time, I warned Ron that hits from show exposure will 
definitely crash Ron&#x27;s site... 

He&#x27;s cool about it... LOL! 

Happy Holidays!

Lance

Yea, Rosemary is very excited about doing the show and now she has 
her very own MiniBox to play with, so it would be exciting the one 
thing that has not happened, but will now that Rosemary has a box, is 
that she can go on radio live and let people listen directly then 
let the chips land where they may.  My posted response was to try and 
cut off all the crap from Chris Moon, it rally tweaks my nose when 
someone like him tries to dictate to me, a Jesuit Educated researcher 
all about how to do my job and that his truth is the only truth.

Anyplace you may venture where the box is mentioned, I&#x27;d appreciate 
it if you posted my response.
 
Thanks,

Rick</pre>
