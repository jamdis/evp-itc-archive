Well I can hear them just fine. Bless her heart hehehe.
   
  I always wondered if I didnt believe in it would I have gotten my first evp. Tho it was an accident I still KNEW it was possible that evp could be recorded and had heard some others results over the years I just never realized that "I" could get them anywhere if I tried. I just thought ya had to be someplace "haunted" so that was my first bubble burst =) Ive had to rethink quite a few things. I realize now that theres no need to hunt for ghosts they hunt for me instead.
