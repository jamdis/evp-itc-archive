I should correct something-that estimate of the radiation being half that o=
f a dental x-ray was an accumulative total over the time period of 2 days. =
So that means that probably no one spot was even that high.

  Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] A Quest=
ion on Radiation


    
  Again, I am talking about background radiation su=
ch as is found at Chernobyl.

  According to my research, this is the most =
radioactive spot on the face of the earth. Even so, the level of radiation =
found in the accessible areas of Chernobyl is mostly no higher then half of=
 what you get with a dental x-ray. The levels here are not high enough to e=
ffect any electronic equipment we normally use. The only equipment that may=
 be effected would be equipment that is poorly shielded.

  Here is a link =
to Timm Suess's Chernobyl journal. He is photographer that has been to and =
toured Chernobyl: http://timmsuess.com/chernobyl-journal/

  I asked Timm a=
bout the effect the radioactivity found at Chernobyl had on electronic equi=
pment. Her is his reply to me:

    "Hi April

    Thanks for your feedback=
! Glad you like my photographs!

    Interesting question about the interfe=
rence of radiation with my equipment. No, I didn't have any problems; the r=
adiation levels are far too low to have any effect on electronics or optica=
l elements. As contaminated the zone is, I received during my stay a radiat=
ion dose of only about 5 microsieverts, which is half of what you get at a =
dental X-ray. I guess if I would have entered the sarcophagus, where the ra=
diation is the highest (much, much higher than anywhere else in the zone), =
there would have been additional noise on my pictures. But radiation dimini=
shes exponentially the farther away you are from the source, so the effect =
of what's inside the reactor flats out within a couple of dozen meters or s=
o. The overall background radiation is not high enough to have any immediat=
e effect on people or equipment.

    However, shortly after the accident i=
n 1986, the cleanup crews tried to use remote-controlled robots to get rid =
of the contaminated graphite pieces on the roof. Those robots broke down af=
ter only a few hours, due to the radiation, which was so high it would kill=
 you within only a short time.

    I hope this answers your question,
    =
Best regards from Switzerland, Timm"

  In addition, here are some other so=
urces of info on the subject:

    Effects of Radiation on Electronic Equip=
ment
    http://radlab.nl/radsafe/archives/9602/msg00492.html

    Radiatio=
n damage to electronic equipment
    http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/a=
te/q3172.html

  After reading these reports, it seems they don't really kn=
ow because it is like saying rocks are brown. Well yeah-some rocks are brow=
n, but there are so many rocks in the universe, one can hardly make any eff=
ective statement at all.

  But what I got from it, is that for an electron=
ic device to be effected, it has to be poorly shielded.

  Even the most se=
nsitive equipment us ghost hunters use would probably not be effected. Even=
 in the highest radiation levels at Chernobyl, it isn't high enough to get =
past the shielding.

          It doesn=
't really matter if it's a "point event" (by which I assume you mean a shor=
t burst).   It depends on a lot of things: the type and sensitivity of the =
equipment; its environment; the types of radiation to which it is exposed; =
and its intensity and duration.  

          As regards chenobyl, there was=
 a lot of radioactice material released into the environment, and which sti=
ll causes problems, especially as the material blown into surrounding soils=
 is released, even to enter the  foodchain.  While the restricted areas the=
re may be the worst (and the easiest to contain), they are by no means the =
end of the problem, nor the extent of the continuing radiation issues.

            We're not talking about a poi=
nt event. We talking about high levels of background radiation, such as you=
 would find a Chernobyl.

            Again, the only area that may pose a =
problem is the restricted area, which no on is aloud to enter.

                    If we're talking about r=
adiation as the transference through space of EMF, then yes it can effect e=
quipment.  The biggest example often cited is the electromagnetic pulse put=
 off by a nuclear blast, that can disable electronic equipment.  But even s=
maller events can do it: satellites have to be protected against certain ra=
diation so their memory isn't zapped, etc.

                    So it depen=
ds on a lot of things: the type and sensitivity of the equipment; its envir=
onment; the types of radiation to which it is exposed; and its intensity an=
d duration.  

                    As a side note, remember something as be=
nign as a magnet can royally screw up some electronic components as well.
