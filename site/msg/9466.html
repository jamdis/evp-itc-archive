william,
 
Welcome to a very elite club. There are only a few of us that h=
ave had this type of session.
I bet you will never forget to save a recordi=
ng again!
 
That's why I never record to the computer to much chance of a c=
omputer glich.
power failure, surge, computer freeze up etc.
 
Get a small =
digital recorder that has usb connection and record on that, upload the rec=
ording to
the computer and don't erase it from the digital recorder for at =
least a week.
 
Sometimes the session is only meant for your ears and not t=
o be posted so our friends will dispose
of the recording.
 
Most likely com=
puter error. sounds like it was a great session, you must be well liked.
ke=
ep up the great work.

[EVP-ITC] Most amazing session




Hey guysI had the most amazing session l=
ast night. Me and my fiance did a session, and this is how it went. We usal=
ly do 10 min. of audio, and during the session we first contacted a guy nam=
ed Virgil, and we got him to say both of our names. He said "William" for m=
e, and "Leigh" for Ashley. We all communicated for the 10 min. He didn't an=
swer every question, but he answered 75% of all answerslast night. We told =
him that we wanted to prove that they exsisted on the other side. Life afte=
r death. He answer "we are over here", very plainly. After the 10 min. We a=
sk for confirmation so we could shut off the radio, and we got this answer =
"that would be a bad idea". Which freaked Ashley out. So we kept the radio =
on and we had a conversation with this preacher, then while the band was st=
ill sweeping the preacher came through and he talked to us (while sweeping =
the band), and started to preach to us about our side, and how messed up it=
 is.(the band was sweeping the whole time, I never stop the band from sweep=
ing) He said that we needed to pray for our enemies as well as our friends =
and families. He talked to us for 6 to eight minutes. Then we finished the =
session (Ask for confirmation)when he didn't come through any more. We shut=
 down. Then of course I get up and put everything back the way it is suppos=
ed to be. Leaving the session that we just did on the laptop. Then I went t=
o take a shower, and I come back. The laptop was turned off and I lost all =
of the session. Sometimes the computer will log itself off, then when you g=
et back it is exactly the was it was when you left it. But this wasn't the =
case, some reason the laptop shut itself off, and we lost all of the eviden=
ce that we had. Didn't have nothing, and I couldn't believe that we lost ev=
erything. So thats why I am sitting here typing away about what happen last=
 night. Instead of me posting files about what happen last night. I wish so=
 bad that y'all would have been able to hear the communication. It was a li=
fe changing experience. It made me think a whole lot different about box re=
search. I still can't believe I didn't save it before the computer turned i=
tself off. That is what happen to me last night, and change box research fo=
r me for the rest of my life.ThanksWilliam Rees Clarke III
