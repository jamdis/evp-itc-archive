I got initiated into the paranormal 4 yrs ago and accidentally got my fir=
st EVP 3 yrs ago. I went crazy searching for information about spirit boxes=
. And what I found is that most people sing the praises of Frank's Ghost bo=
x and Frank Sumption. I didn't know who Frank Sumption was (still don't kno=
w you personally) but from what I could tell there were (are) many many peo=
ple who believe that Frank Sumption is a giant when it comes to spirit boxe=
s.=C2=A0

You can't control what people say or do. But your work seems to s=
tand on it's own merit. So it doesn't matter what your competitors say, it =
still stands that Frank Sumption is the giant among spirit boxes and is up =
there with Thomas Edison. You are letting them upset you when the reality i=
s, you are still on top. So let them say what they want. And let them make =
improvements and have their own merit. From my point of view, as an outside=
r looking in, they are standing on your shoulders. I have no vestment in th=
is argument or in you and your rivals. Don't let them drive you insane with=
 their claims or weigh you down with unnecessary anger and bitterness. You =
are doing just fine.=C2=A0

Question now is, are you going to believe those=
 who anger you and tell you you are not the original creator OR are you goi=
ng to believe someone that is a total stranger that did her research a few =
years ago before stumbling onto this argument? And may I remind you I have =
no vestment in this argument whatsoever? You could say I'm biased since whe=
n I researched I came to believe myself that Frank Sumption was/is a giant =
when it comes to spirit boxes. If I were you, I'd choose to believe me and =
go on to create bad ass equipment and not reveal your secrets. :)

"My guys" repeat over and over and ove=
