Thanks for the clarificatio=
n Mike. I would still warn that, even in 
your experiment here, you yoursel=
f could become your own weak link in
objectivity. As Cheri pointed out, eve=
n someone with the best 
intentions, who truly wants to provide accurate & =
honest information,
is only human and subject to error. This is especially =
true if they
have already decided which parts of their theories are right o=
r wrong,
without, again, objective testing. This is not a phenomenon that o=
nly
effects the home experimenter, but experts in all fields, and they
have=
 learned of methods over time (such as the double blind testing I
mentioned=
) to help weed out weak processes and develop and explore
their theories on=
 the firmest foundations possible.

But I understand you are not trying to =
prove or test anything in this
case, or use them to claim any kind of proof=
: you're just trying an
experiment. So, good luck with it.
