I went to school here at the U of Ill and ended up staying in \ntown.  I work as an engineer/geophysicist for a small engineering firm. \nI got my BSEE in 1974 and MSEE in 1977. I guess that dates me even more!\n\nI grew up in the Joliet area, which is a couple hours to the north.  I&#39;m \nconnected with several paranormal groups including the Will County group \n(Joliet area) and some in central Illinois.\n\nI played around with EVPMaker a little.  Just wish I had more time ...\n\nZack\n\nOn Wed, 20 Jun 2007, Guy wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi, Zack.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have my BSEE from U of I in your neck of the woods! Yep...I&#39;ve\n&gt; lived on campus in both Urbana and Champaign. It&#39;s been years since\n&gt; I&#39;ve been back (actually - not since I graduated in\n&gt; 1980...lol...THAT dates me!). I&#39;ve studied on and off for both my\n&gt; commercial radio license and ham license but just never followed\n&gt; through on getting them - too many other things going on.\n&gt;\n&gt; By the way - I was born and raised in Moline (the Quad Cities) but\n&gt; now I&#39;m thoroughly &quot;embedded&quot; here in Southern California...no more\n&gt; ice and freezing cold and snow for me!\n&gt;\n&gt; Have you downloaded and tried Stefan Bion&#39;s EVPMaker yet? As you\n&gt; know from reading Frank&#39;s documentation - that&#39;s what he based\n&gt; the &quot;Ghost Box&quot; on...\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyhow - welcome!\n&gt;\n&gt; Guy\n&gt;"}
