So I agree with \nthis.  I only hear about 10% of the answers live, and find re-\nlistening to the recording at least two times is beneficial to catch \neverything.\n\nHowever, we were at a lighthouse that was supposed to be haunted, and \na lady asked if there was a &quot;Captain Babcock&quot; with us.  About 8 \nseconds later, the reply, &quot;Spirit of Babcock&quot; came through clearly.  \nThe file is in my folder here.  So I do see value as well in asking \nquestions.  The downside is we have a tendency to talk over them \nsometimes, yet, it is nice to provide the earthbounds direction to \nhelp them speak what we need to hear (to help them).  If people think \nthey do not need help, then they haven&#39;t been doing this enough in \nplaces where people in spirit are in trauma.  Believe me, some of \nthem truly are and are in need of help - period.  \n\nPerhaps there are two ways to do this, depending on what one is \ntrying to accomplish.  At a haunted location, I seem to hear \nenlightened spirits, as well as earthbounds coming through.  This \ntype of situation can be especially helpful to ask questions in my \nexperience, as it helps to ferret out what&#39;s going on there and \nprovide &quot;evidence&quot; of intelligent responses to the questions.  This \nworked well to prove the spirit box as legit to the group who \naccompanied me.\n\nWhen just trying to get &quot;higher&quot; messages from spirits, etc at home \nor elsewhere, I do think just letting it run and record is a great \nway to work with it, too.  This way, there are no expectations, just \ntaking the time to listen for direction, messages of truth, hellos, \netc.  Sometimes this way will really surprise you, especially when \nsomething comes through &quot;off the cuff&quot; and you are not expecting it.  \n\nFrank, I hear your advice captain, but also want to throw in some of \nmy personal experiences into the discussion.\n\nLC\n   \n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; \n&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi All;\n&gt; \n&gt;  This is why I say don&#39;t get so tied up asking questions and trying \nto \n&gt; get that one profound answer while missing all the real stuff. In \nthe \n&gt; file I have in my folder of the 30 second test of #36, the very \nfirst \n&gt; voice is &quot;Thomas Edison(sung)--I Never Visited Frank&quot;, I did not \nhear \n&gt; this until the third time I listened to the entire session. I&#39;m not \nso \n&gt; intent on runing session after session all friggin&#39; day that I \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; have/take time to listen. If I was trying to hear this stuff \ndirect, I \n&gt; would miss it, and simialr voices about 99% of the time. That&#39;s \nwhy, \n&gt; forget the damn questions, and just listen--over and over till you \n&gt; think you&#39;ve gotten it all. Even my dad, and son come through in \ntheir \n&gt; own time, I don&#39;t costantly ask for them. I swear to God, they know \nwho \n&gt; is listening, when you are listening/recording, and what you need \nto \n&gt; know! Trust it!\n&gt; \n&gt;  I know, the idiot scientist type will insist you have to ask \n&gt; questions, and confirm the answers, but that is BS, and results \nlittle \n&gt; useful information. Useful, as in has personal signifgance. \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
