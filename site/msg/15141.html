<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>An op amp is an &quot;operational amplifier&quot; which is essentially treated as a
little box that amplifies linearly whatever is put into it. By using
different resistors in a circuit you can adjust the gain of the op amp
circuit.

I&#x27;m not sure exactly how Frank is using one for the tuning. It&#x27;s not very
common to use an op amp as a noise source but I think it&#x27;s been done. There
are better noise sources out there.

&gt;  There was a smaller Schematic Frank posted about using the tuner from a
&gt; radioshack 469. It was a smaller diagram just showing where to plug your
&gt; signal into the vt, and to provide the 3v into the tuner. Sorry im not more
&gt; specific, im a newbie to circuits.
&gt;
&gt; Frank emailed me back and said for a random sweep he no longer likes using
&gt; the white noise generator, and instead prefers to use a dual supply op amp.
&gt; Im not entirely sure what a op amp is or how to use it. Im assuming it
&gt; produces a random signal that can be used for the VT. BUt I need to do alot
&gt; more research to learn what it really does.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hello all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for having me apart of your yahoo group. Ive been researching this
&gt; a lot and was overly excited to find a group that actually has frank posting
&gt; in it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m about to attempt to make my first box ( well i have made the ufogeek
&gt; radio shack hack, but that was too easy). I plan to try and make the one
&gt; with a random voltage generator that&#x27;s plugged into the Radio Shack 499, and
&gt; if I can do that successfully, out to an echo-box before heading out.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My question to you all is if you could point me in the right direction to
&gt; get up to speed enough on circuits and electronics via a website or book. I
&gt; have no experience doing this kind of stuff. But im a quick learner and
&gt; really want to make this happen.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for the help everyone,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; God Bless and Good Results to you all.
&gt; &gt;
