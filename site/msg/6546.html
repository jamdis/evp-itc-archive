Let me know when you have listened, as it is time I clean out the

&gt; Thanks LC.  I&#x27;m going to listen to your recordings tonight when I 
get home.  I&#x27;m intrigued by the box research and anxious to get 
started, but frustrated that I&#x27;m not mechanically inclined.  I think 
you may be onto something with regard to people having individual 
roles to play, and you must feel so inspired by the messages you&#x27;ve 
received.

&gt;   Robin,
&gt; 
&gt;   I uploaded some of my recordings that indicate a bigger picture.
&gt; 
&gt;   Some of the messages say there are &quot;many spirits here,&quot; spirit 
rescue 
&gt;   is &quot;very important,&quot; etc. You can go through them under LC&#x27;s 
folder.
&gt; 
&gt;   Last Friday, I recorded with respect to 2008, &quot;psychic event&quot; 
&gt;   and &quot;universal shift.&quot; That would indicate that there is a bigger 
&gt;   thing going down, in my opinion. However, I also acknowledge that 
&gt;   people here may have different callings/messages/uses other than 
what 
&gt;   I am hearing. I am going to just follow where the path before me 
&gt;   leads and try to find my role in it.
&gt; 
&gt;   Personally, I think this needs to be in many people&#x27;s hands. 
That&#x27;s 
&gt;   an interest of mine, too. Not sure yet how it will happen, but 
the 
&gt;   radio hacks are a nice start.

&gt;   &gt; I haven&#x27;t started box recording yet. My impression of the EVP 
I&#x27;ve 
&gt;   captured (which has been almost entirely obtained on the property 
I 
&gt;   moved to six years ago) is that someone is attached to this 
place. 
&gt;   The first message was &quot;Here come some people,&quot; as I was hiking up 
the 
&gt;   hill one day with my goats, then a kill-you threat in the house, 
&gt;   then &quot;get out of here&quot; in the barn. I assumed it must be one of 
the 
&gt;   original owners, and I still feel that it&#x27;s mainly one spirit 
&gt;   communicating that this is their home, not mine. I&#x27;ve gotten one 
&gt;   uplifting message from what I believe to be the same entity, and 
this 
&gt;   is also the last recording I&#x27;ve gotten. I asked what death is 
like, 
&gt;   compared to life: happy, beautiful, fulfilling--and specifically 
if 
&gt;   death is less depressing. The response was &quot;It&#x27;s everything.&quot; 
&gt;   S/he/it basically stopped talking after that, and I stopped 
trying. 
&gt;   I know this sounds weird, but I miss whoever or whatever it was. 
I 
&gt;   wonder if some of us might be better at dealing with the low-life 
&gt;   stuck or grounded entities rather than the highly evolved 
technicians 
&gt;   coming through the more sophisticated equipment. I wonder where 
this 
&gt;   is all going ultimately, other than to prove communication across 
the 
&gt;   veil is possible. I&#x27;m not an engineer or technologist on this 
&gt;   physical plane, and I question what I have to offer this research 
&gt;   since I&#x27;m so electronically challenged. Meanwhile, the nurse side 
of 
&gt;   me wants to heal and &quot;fix&quot; anyone needing help, even if they 
happen 
&gt;   to be in the next world! Do the guides and technicians ever 
&gt;   acknowledge or make reference to the earthbound spirits, and if 
so, 
&gt;   in what context? Are we ever able to help unstick the stuck ones? 
&gt;   Are we supposed to ignore them?

&gt;   &gt; EVP:
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; Not that this is always the case, but EVP seems to primarily 
&gt;   capture 
&gt;   &gt; lost people - ghosts being recorded, versus the box having the 
&gt;   &gt; ability to capture primarily what seems to be higher 
&gt;   communication 
&gt;   &gt; from spirits, (and less of the lower communication - ghosts 
&gt;   jumping 
&gt;   &gt; in).
&gt;   &gt; 
&gt;   &gt; That to me is a huge difference... ;)

&gt;   &gt; &gt; I agree about the difference also. All that review time makes 
&gt;   for a
&gt;   &gt; &gt; very tedious few hours. By the end of it you&#x27;re ready to pull 
&gt;   your
&gt;   &gt; &gt; hair out. I&#x27;ve only done two sessions now and have gotten more
&gt;   &gt; &gt; positive results in 20 minutes time as I have in 10 years of

&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well guys, I have to tell you that since I started box 
&gt;   sessions 
&gt;   &gt; in
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; November I have become so spoiled that conventional EVP 
&gt;   just 
&gt;   &gt; don&#x27;t do
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it for me.
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My organization was asked to come and do an investigation 
&gt;   at a 
&gt;   &gt; very
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; historial place (here in Illinois). The owner of this 
home 
&gt;   &gt; asked if I
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would bring one of the boxes to the home (he is amazed 
with 
&gt;   the
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immediately 2 way communication). So upon respectfully 
&gt;   asking 
&gt;   &gt; my tec
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if it was alright to do a session outside the my home we 
&gt;   did 
&gt;   &gt; several
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box sessions along with conventional EVP. We wanted to 
see 
&gt;   if 
&gt;   &gt; we could
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discover some unanswered history about the residence, and 
&gt;   the 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; otherside
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was more than willing to comply.
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have to tell you that the regular EVP recordings were 
and 
&gt;   are 
&gt;   &gt; the
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; most boring data to review. Something I use to love so 
much 
&gt;   has
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually turned into a project given I am waiting for a 
&gt;   response
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immediately! Too funny how things can change overnight!
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will be uploading some files for these sessions if you 
&gt;   are 
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested.
