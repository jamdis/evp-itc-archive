<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Misty,

I have and idea.  One solution is to post Mp3 files instead of Wav. 
files or any other format.  It seems like the Mp3&#x27;s sound the same 
and are only 1/10th of the size.  I think that would probably clear 
up 90 percent of the board right there.  If i actually have more than 
a couple files from here on out, i will be attaching them to an e-
mail and not the board to save space here.  And also, if people do 
post files maybe we can all just have one post that says we have 
uploaded files to our folder instead of 30 audio announcements in a 
row that just seems to waste a lot of e-mail space in the individual 
e-mails.  And it also pushes the current topic on the board to 
another page and is lost for those who wanted to share.  Just my 
thoughts on helping the subject.  I know we are all excited, but 
misty is right.  I went to add a file the other day and the group was 
at 93 percent capacity, so it won&#x27;t be long before we run out of 
space.

&gt; Just a little friendly reminder that you all need to organize your 
&gt; files better in the files area. Space is limited here and you are 
all 
&gt; nearing the 100% mark so try to keep your section under 5 megs. If 
&gt; you need more space use www.esnips.com and you can store 50 gigs to 
&gt; share with the group or public.
&gt; 
&gt; I think it is great you guys have so much to share I just wish that 
&gt; our yahoo group wasnt so limited on space (and that I wasnt so 
&gt; limited on time). But I have found a way around it. If just a few 
&gt; people signed up and shared using esnips they can invite others to 
&gt; visit thier files and once they do they also get 50 gigs of free 
&gt; space for audio pictures or video or whatever you want to post.
&gt; 
&gt; I was considering setting up one &quot;group&quot; account to start with and 
&gt; inviting all members who post files to join it and be able to post 
to 
&gt; the account. It will automatically notify everyone thats a member 
&gt; when a file is added to it just like the yahoo group does. It also 
&gt; allows you to share with the public or privately if you so choose. 
&gt; You can even allow your friends to post to your account if you wish.
&gt; 
&gt; This group has grown and expanded and we just need to make a few 
&gt; changes to how we do things to keep it running more smoothly for 
the 
&gt; future. I am hoping that you all will help me in this endeavor. I 
&gt; know many of you have already adapted the idea to help us organize 
&gt; and maintain the group.
&gt; 
&gt; I want you to keep sharing and to be able to share more! 
&gt; 
&gt; So please organize and not post stray files that are targets for 
&gt; deletion once the que is 100% full. And for your own sake, if no 
one 
&gt; elses, be respectful to each other.
