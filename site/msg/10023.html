<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank,

&gt;  This guy has a thing it&#x27;s part hardware (the Speakjet), part software
&gt; that produces real time words that is influanced--sometimes to give 
&gt; intelligent, and meaningful responses, at the same time it logs the 
&gt; allophones used, the words formed, and what level on his antenna caused 
&gt; the words, and prints it on a screen. He&#x27;s the same guy that came up 
&gt; with the RS hack. His approach is he just wants more data.

Logging the allophones while they are played sounds like an interesting
idea, and as an alternative to actual speech-to-text it can help to
verify what is heard. It&#x27;s similar to what I had played with and
described in my yesterday&#x27;s e-mail:

The guy you mentioned isn&#x27;t perhaps Rob Fitzgerald
(www.DeadScience.com)? He had constructed a SpeakJet box, coupled to an
EMF antenna.
