<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just a little background, i grew up and now own the house i grew up 
in. It has been paranormally active all my life and am very curious 
about who is here and why.  This box idea has shed new light on this 
area in my life, because now i can possibly piece this puzzle 
together.  My house was an old farm house built back in 1845 and i 
know of 1 death in the home at least.  The attic used to house 
orphans and was used as a foster home in the early 1900&#x27;s.  I 
currently live alone and the more i learn about this field the more 
interested i get about new items and ideas.  I have been using my FM 
sweep version of the box for about 3 weeks and the sessions get 
better everyday.  I started only hearing 1 word fragments, but now i 
am getting partial sentences.  I tell them on the other side to keep 
trying at this and to try to come across the whole band to form 
complete sentences and not just between random fm bits.  I can hear 
the difference, the static is actually coming across the whole band 
but i am unable to make out the vocals yet.  But they are trying.  
If people are not getting the boxes to work, they just don&#x27;t have 
the patience.  I could have stopped after day 1 or day 2 after 
getting nothing, but i didn&#x27;t.  They need to get to know you and 
they also need to learn how to speak through this device, so 
patience and practice is a key element.  It will happen, just stick 
with it people.

Great message board by the way.  I learn more evrytime i go on 
here.  Please check out my Mp3&#x27;s on the FILES section and tell me 
what you think.  I haven&#x27;t received a lot of feedback yet.  At least 
maybe someone can tell me about the FM radio i&#x27;m using and if i&#x27;m 
heading in the right direction.

Thanx,
-Steve H.</pre>
