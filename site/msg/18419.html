There is another two year old boy that has gone missing in AZ, why not lets 
ask spirit about this, this child lives about 1.5 hours from the Syler boy, 
who is now a criminal investigation, it looks like they ignored the name of 
the man that spirit said took him, oh well.  It may be the same guy in both 
cases, they are now looking into local child molesters lists.  This other 
little kid, was missing, his dog came back, but it looked like someone picked 
him up too. sf
