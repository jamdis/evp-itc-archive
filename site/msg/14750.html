<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>What I have been hearing on this since the first posting is a single
 tap that sounds like wood on wood. Since the tapping was continual
 and you noticed an EM spike there is another possibility.

 You could have detected a PK event. In poltergeist cases we have come
 to realize that living PK agents often are responsible. These agents
 function in environments with specific characteristics and themselves
 exhibit specific traits. One of the environmental characteristics is
 an elevated magnetic field. Often this is a geomagnetic field as seems
 to be the case in extreme poltergeist cases. Less extremem cases, 
 such as this may be, we often see elevated EM field levels. Do your
 readings in your notes? Were you reading electrical or magnetic
 fields? What type of EMF meter were you using? This might help
 determine if the info you noticed was potentially related to PK
 effects.
