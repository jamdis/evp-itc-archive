you need a transistor that will oscillate up to at least 1ghz-preferably up to 8ghz.  mrf901 or mrf571hook it up as a regenerative detector.  even simpler, take a center tapped 12 volt power transformer.  hook positive of aa battery to center. negative to emitter of transistor. collector to either remaining tap on transformer.  i megohm rheostat/potentiometer to other lug of transformer in series to base of transistor. capacitatively couple hv side of transformer to input of audio amp.  you can get some effect with 2n222 transistor from radio shack.  adjust rheostat till you just begin to hear faint high pitched tone then add 6 ft of wire to base for antenna. move wires around till radio voices get loud.  at that point it will be squegging (superregenerative)  rfparts.com has mrf901 transistors
   
  at some point of adjustment , multiple radio voices turn to something much much different.  you will KNOW. just let it run. its ok to turnit off but dont move it from room to room.
   
  the only way to make it cover a whole neighborhood is to drive a ground rod about 6ft into ground and you need a slightly elevated antenna of some kind which can be indoors. the ground rod must be in the ground and not a water pipe although -for reasons i cant figure out, the shut off valve down low next to the toilet on ground floor will work.  just clamp ground to that (dont put antenna where kightning will zap toilet though;  very embarrassing way to depart the material world.}

  They have those giant palmetto bugs down here and tis the season and they are basically a roach that flies right at ya out of the blue... and note to all...if one flies at me and you are in my way I WILL run you over. So you could say it makes my skin turn green and I'd still raise my hand to be test dummy rofl
   
  Sounds cool Ken cant wait to hear more details. And the other benefits are amazing. I think perhaps that relates slightly to what we spoke about recently, the energy field and the healing sun couch.
   
  The chinese call it Chi, some people call it the chakras, I call it the soul energy field. I think some are able to tap into use of this field at will, moving it, influencing with it. It has resonance with the body but is not fully contained in it. Accupuncture applies needles to certain points in the body which focuses the energy field and unblocks it when needed. A bit like small antennas to resonate or act as recievers?

  people start commenting on how fresh the air smells in the house.  mild actinic irritation to eyes and suntan without sun.  clogged earwax liquifies and drains out , hearing improves proportionately.
   
  foliage (green) and SOME car taillights(red) seem very intensely colored
   
  pest insects disappear from house (roaches,flies,mosquitoes) traditionally "fortunate" bugs move in (crickets spiders)
   
  acute arthritic symptoms vanish and stay vanished till you leave the house for 4 to 6 hrs then begin returning IN THE EXACT REVERSE OF THE ORDER THEY APPEARED
  some APPARENT rejuvenation effects after prolonged exposure but CERTAINLY no negative effects
  effects are detectable in entire area covered by one electric power meter
  etc,etc,etc,etc 
   
   
  no qualms about signing my name to it either
   
  dont know yet how to hook it to frank box.
