Hi all,

OK, I'll try to write down the steps necessary to synthesize text by
combining allophones. In this example I will show how to synthesize the
word "hello".

1. Open SJ-Allophone.wav in Audition.

2. Show the Cue List, if not already opened, by selecting "View > Show
Cue List" from the menu.

3. Look up the first allophone of "hello", an "h" with transition to
"e". Choose the allophone "HE" as the first one. Double-click it in the
Cue List - it will get selected in the waveform window. To listen to it,
click the Play button. To copy the selected allophone to a new file,
press <Ctrl><C>, and then <Ctrl><Shift><N>. The allophone will open in a
new window. Press <End> to set the cursor at the end of the waveform.
Press <Ctrl><Tab> to return to the SJ-Allophones window.

4. Look up the next allophone for the word "hello", which is the "e"
sound. The (probably) correct allophone is labeled "EH", so double-click
it, listen to it by clicking Play, and if it's the correct one, press
<Ctrl><C> to copy it to the clipboard, then press <Ctrl><Tab> to switch
to the new created file, press <Ctrl><V> to insert the allophone from
the clipboard at the and of the new file (cursor position). Press <End>
to set the cursor at the end of the waveform, then again <Ctrl><Tab> to
return to the SJ-Allophones window.

5. Repeat Step 4 for the remaining two allophones of "hello", which are
labeled "LO" and "OWWW".

So the word "hello" is composed of the allophones: HE + EH + LO + OWWW

6. Save the new file. In my example, I saved it as
"SJ-Allophones - hello.wav" and can be downloaded/listened to here:
