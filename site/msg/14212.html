It would be pretty weird for the police to adopt a code that could be conf=
used between going to the doctor, or seeing someone shot.=A0 I sure wouldn'=
t want to report a Code 7, and risk a SWAT team breaking into the dentist j=
ust when the drill was going into my mouth.

Code 7 means things like home, on personal time, in court, etc.

Tonight at work I was talking to a state trooper, there h=
ad been an accident. I asked him if there were any deaths (it was very very=
 bad) and he said he didnt know so he got on his radio and called in and as=
ked them if it was a 7 at the site. They told him negative, and he told me =
the little boy who was the worst off was still alive. I asked him why did y=
ou ask them if it was a 7. He said code 7, I was asking them if they were d=
ead. So if you ever hear anyone call 7 over the radio that means someones d=
ead.

Just thought I would pass that on. I find it interesting since I k=
now alot of us have heard this before when used to describe who is speaking=
 rather than a name they say seven.
