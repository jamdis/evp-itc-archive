<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>In &quot;Adriana&#x27;s files&quot; in the Files section, please see shirtcolor.mp3

My husband was asking what color is his shirt, but he was barely audible, and then I repeated more loudly, &quot;What color is his shirt?&quot; 

The evp starts at the point where I say this...

And I believe the response is &quot;Is it grey, yellow?  PINK!... then someone yells STOP&quot;

Definitely someone said pink, but I don&#x27;t know if anyone else hears the other two colors??? Feedback?

Btw, his sweatshirt was light yellow.</pre>
