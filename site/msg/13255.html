Thanks Ron you saved me alot of typing LOL=


You are correct RJ, if you are still in the stage of how and why and look=
ing for "proof" it is better to do experiments and sharing the way you desc=
ribe. Go for it.

And Ron already knows me well. I am a little beyond carin=

r chatter, document for my own learning, and share with a few friends or pe=
rsons its meant for privately. Once in a while I post samples for others wh=
o are curious about the different methods being used or new to the subject.=
 

I never expect anyone to hear anything as I do, its a nice surprise when=
 someone does =3D)

Good luck!

Misty
