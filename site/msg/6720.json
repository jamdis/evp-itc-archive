I rec=\r\nognise their individual voice patterns. I have built a solid relationship w=\r\nith these two spirits\nI know as mike and Lisa so much so that I have even g=\r\notten to know their individual personalities.\n \nThere are other newer resea=\r\nrchers here that will attest to the fact that when they where doing their f=\r\nirst sessions\nI had asked my two &quot;Friends&quot; Mike and Lisa to assist in getti=\r\nng them started and invariably the spirits that came \nthrough to these new =\r\nresearchers during their first sessions identified themselves as Mike and L=\r\nisa.\n \nSteve says he does not turn on his box and use them as a crutch, tha=\r\nt is not entirely true. I had done research \nvery closely with Steve until =\r\nrecently and I would venture to say that 99% if not every session he starts=\r\n with &quot;Mike & Lisa\nare you available to talk with me&quot; \n \nAlso I don&#39;t consi=\r\nder working with my technicians as using them as a crutch, They would not a=\r\nllow that.\nThey are not there like butlers at our beckoned call when we fee=\r\nl they may be of some use.\nQuite the opposite, without them we would get no=\r\n communication at all, they are allowing us the honor of receiving this \nce=\r\nlestial communication. They are the moderators, facilitators and generators=\r\n of all we hear and send to and from the spirit realm.\nAnd they also stand =\r\nas guards and protectors to do the best they can to keep us from being dece=\r\nived or taken down a dark path.\n \nSome here wait for others to state an opi=\r\nnion and then tend to agree with that opinion no matter what they have expe=\r\nrienced to be true.\n \nRobin, my advice to you as a new researcher in this f=\r\nield. Form your own beliefs through your experience and research.\nListen an=\r\nd learn from others but do not let what you believe to be true or not, be s=\r\nwayed by popular opinion.\n \nBruce\nBruce Halliday \n\n\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups=\r\n.comFrom: MudPuddleFarm@...: Sat, 2 Feb 2008 21:42:09 -0800Subject:=\r\n Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: File from tonight\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve,\n \nI certainly appreciate =\r\nyour thoughts.
