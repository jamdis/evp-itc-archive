I set up the feedback method then the white video noise recording method. I somehow feel the feedback method will yield the results I am hoping for but haven&#39;t reviewed enough work of our collegues in the field to compare success ratios for each method. I recorded three minutes of each setup and we did a quick review but didn&#39;t have time during that meeting to transfer the recorded material into a computer for proper frame by frame analysis.\n   \n  Which recording method do you believe is the most effective?\n   \n  -Bill\n\r\n--0-1935179860-1167114586=:8395\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Misty - We recently demonstrated ITC recording techniques for members of our local research group.
