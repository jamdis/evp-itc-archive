Look \n                            at it the other way: if the number o=\r\nf bytes were \n                            DIFFERENT, than you&#39;d know the fi=\r\nles HAD changed, \n                            and you could stop testing.&n=\r\nbsp; But if the number \n                            of bytes are the same, =\r\nit tends to indicate the \n                            files are likely the =\r\nsame, but you still need a low \n                            level file comp=\r\narison to be sure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My method \n                            is to comp=\r\nare the files using the CMP command in \n                            unix.&n=\r\nbsp; There are many programs to compare \n                            files,=\r\n but you have to be careful not to use one \n                            tha=\r\nt does a line-by-line compare (or a comparison \n                           =\r\n meant for text files), since text files can be \n                          =\r\n  different at a low level, but look essential the \n                       =\r\n     same in an editor (because of the way spaces and \n                    =\r\n        tabs and new lines work between editors and \n                      =\r\n      platforms).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But anyway, the way to compare is \n               =\r\n             with a program that can compare binary files, not \n           =\r\n                 text files.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Sun, 5/10/09, April \n    =\r\n                        Abercrombie &lt;i&gt;&lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch.=\r\n \n                            com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
