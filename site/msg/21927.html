<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>By the way, I only listed what I heard. That doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m wrong. I know I&#x27;m not immune to misinterpretation. Comments are always welcome. :)

&gt; Here are two recordings I made using Steve&#x27;s file at
&gt; http://stevehultay.com/evpsoftware.html*. *These recordings are interesting
&gt; because I get several really blatant messages that seem relevant to me
&gt; personally, they are incredibly clear in spots, and also because it seems
&gt; that the responses are better heard when you play the file back at roughly
&gt; 150% of the normal speed. I haven&#x27;t altered these files in any way. These
&gt; are both stored on SoundCloud.

&gt; 
&gt; In this first file, done August 25, 2011 at 10:00 a.m. It seems like they&#x27;re
&gt; addressing two things: (1) my worries that something I don&#x27;t like is living
&gt; in my basement, and (2) my concern over further developing my psychic
&gt; abilities. Before this recording, I did a protection prayer and asked that
&gt; the &quot;angels&#x27; or beings of love and light protect me, my family, and this
&gt; property.

&gt; Here&#x27;s the second recording, done at 11:11 a.m. on August 25, 2011. Before
&gt; this recording, I asked that they tell me who they are and to give me some
&gt; detail about themselves.  At :12, they say &quot;She finds our obits.&quot; This is
&gt; true. I found two obituaries for the man who built this house and his
&gt; brother, both of whom died within the last year or so. Further on, they talk
&gt; about animal therapy, which I had once discussed with my husband doing with
&gt; our two golden retrievers, both of whom were locked out of the room while I
&gt; recorded.
&gt; 
&gt; :02 Well, I&#x27;m here to help people out.
&gt; :04 Here there are people that help me
&gt; :05 They faked it. the whole outfit.
&gt; :07 I fear the outcome.
&gt; :09 Down stairs I hear them
&gt; :12 She finds our obit
&gt; :13 You have to warn people that there&#x27;s a terrible quake.
&gt; :14 The people end earth and they&#x27;re worried.
&gt; :17 They&#x27;ll thank you
&gt; :18 Yeah, he killed Elliott
&gt; :20 You killed Ike. I fell over, I got killed. It&#x27;s Earl.?
&gt; :24 There are people in poor houses.
&gt; :26 I am worried
&gt; :27 Here people are in poor health.
