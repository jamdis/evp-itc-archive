Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Frank's box on TV last night - DEMON! Rosemary
Guiley!!

 

I was thumbing through Miss Guiley's "Encyclopedia of Ghosts and 
Spirits," today, and was happily surprised to see she is aware that 
the Greeks used the word "daimon" in literature (before Christ) - the 
word "daimon" being best defined as "guardian spirits," and not 
something "evil." The word "demon" evolved out of this 
word "daimon," and was turned into something believed to be evil and 
fearful by religion over the last two thousand years. Why can't this 
truth get out there to the ghost investigating community? I plan on 
writing about this in depth over the next month...I am so tired of 
seeing supposed "experts" on TV using demons to try and frighten 
people with this religious dogma. 

Thanks Rosemary for having this fact in your book under the 
word "demon" - most people are not aware this truth. ;)
