The\nonly thing missing is that tuner, which is usually a seperate board. The\nmini board system is mostly through hole, wiht a few SMT components.

These chips are impossible\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to pull off frequency and are easily made to sweep in any manner you wish,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with the microcontroller. I&#39;ve been playing with generating spread-spectrum\n&gt;&gt;&gt; signals with them.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Zack\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Wed, May 13, 2009 at 9:41 AM, Frank Sumption &lt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   [Attachment(s)&lt;http://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&view=js&name=js&ver=_JFy5EgIPsc.en.&am=b7EwpdTXcKGpB92C0fQ2UrS3D30LUw#1213a6b9f526975c_TopText&gt;from Frank Sumption included below]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   I have kind of a steep learning curve, so while the NE602/612 radio\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; works, it has a bigger foot print cuz it requires some extra amplifiers for\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the audio. I have about 70 of the LM3820 chips, they are an AM radio chip,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with all functions except the audio detector. I had trouble getting this\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chip to work a couple years ago, but since I&#39;ve learned some tricks, like\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adding the oscillator buffer to keep the freq counter from pulling the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; frequency way off, other wise, ya think you have the frequency range set,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but in use it&#39;s completely out of the AM band, so no stations get picked\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up.Then I was not aware of how to set up the ferrite rod antenna. The\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 602/612s are $2 something each, the Lm3820--12 cents from B. G. Micro(in\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tubes of 25). I set up the oscillator last night, then re-drew the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; schematic. I used a regulated supply to hopefully make the oscialltor more\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stable, but the chip will function on 12 volts-besides, come to think about\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it, it has a built in regulator, so the 8V regulator is overkill, maybe even\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; harmful in that  the internal regulator wouldn&#39;t have enough head room.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI migh gi e ha a y, maybe his all. su ace moun I ha e down, as I' e made a ew \"boxes\" all SMT, and I ha e a layou o one sys em ha 's on wo \"mini boa ds\" om Exp essPCB, one boa d is he linea sweep and aduio, he o he is he andom sweep, and hey' e made o be s ackable.
