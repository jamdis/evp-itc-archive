Where can we read some of your previously\npublished material??  Based on your question, I&#39;m assuming you aren&#39;t\nlooking to do the field of EVP/ITC or other paranormal research any\nfavors.  What is your intention???\n\nHow about focusing on something positive?  That would be a nice change\nof pace from the media.  I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find anyone here that is\nwilling to help perpetuate the negative stereotypical views on our\nresearch or other nonsense that is a distraction from the fact that\nthere are valuable EVP/ITC advances taking place.\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dmikolay&quot; &lt;dmikolay@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone ever get an elemental, demon, or otherwise &quot;inhuman&quot; voice?\nAnyone hear from \n&gt; someone with a dire warning?
