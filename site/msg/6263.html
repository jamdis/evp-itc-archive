<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ann, your post about what happened with INIT is so relevant to what
still happens today - even in this forum. Personality conflicts, egos,
aggression, all the not so nice aspects of human behavior really
affect what happens in this field. Although I have two of Marks books
I don&#x27;t have Miracles but it sounds like it has some important lessons.

Everyone has a belief system that affects their opinions of this
research, but if people can&#x27;t get past the petty conflicts then we
can&#x27;t even continue collaborating to advance the connections we&#x27;re
trying to establish that may exist outside the physical world. I am
grateful to most of the people in this forum but must admit I&#x27;m glad
there was some recent housekeeping as it made it difficult to want to
work through all the post. 

Regarding Mark&#x27;s work: for me it compliments the Box research. I&#x27;ve
had some amazing solo journeys using nothing but a meditative mind and
Mark&#x27;s Monroe Institute cd but the Box  seems to bring experimental
communication research into a group environment that I haven&#x27;t found
elsewhere.  -Bill

&gt; Don&#x27;t worry Ann, there is nothing wrong with being a skeptic. Just
don&#x27;t fall into the category of close-minded skeptic, where you
dismiss a claim for the sake of dismissing it and not because you have
proof it is false. I don&#x27;t claim to be skeptical for reasons you will
read below, although at one time I was....
&gt; 
&gt; The message I posted from technician was a specific message by
technician for the members of INIT. It was not a general message to
the world. What it does a good job of is outlining their purpose and
identifying obstacles. What a lot of people do not realize is that
most of these messages you receive are not for anyone other that the
one who receives them. They are personal! Mark and Rolf both shared a
great deal of information with me as well as others. Mark has
personally told me he don&#x27;t care who believes or doesn&#x27;t believe the
things that happened then. Those experiences changed him for life and
will always will be help by him as truth.
&gt; 
&gt; At the present moment Rolf, Dr. Senkowski and Hans are translating
Adolf Holmes journals and writings into English. They are being posted
piece by piece on the World ITC website. You may have not noticed
because the changes have not been announced but they have been posting
them since last June. 
&gt; 
&gt; As for the validity of the events of the pioneers I have to give
them credence just from my own experiences since I began. I have had
many wonderful things happen while I have been experimenting with the
many methods and aspects of ITC. These experiences have made me
realize that those events that you and I have read about are not that
outlandish and are absolutely possible.

&gt; 
&gt;  &gt;&gt;It really surprises me how many new and old ITC &quot;researchers&quot; have  
&gt; 
&gt; not gone through the old data and recordings. The pioneers of this  
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;field&quot; took in tens of thousands of messages and recordings through  
&gt; 
&gt; a wide range of media.&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, they may have done, but how much of that was ever made public?  
&gt; 
&gt; Not very much. Even today. I have gone through what has been  
&gt; 
&gt; released, about six times over. Mark has let more out than just about  
&gt; 
&gt; anyone. The key players, Maggie and Jules, have made very little of  
&gt; 
&gt; theirs available indeed. I&#x27;d love to see that change so that we can  
&gt; 
&gt; better access what was going on.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; At the time INIT was together, I was rather desperately wanting and  
&gt; 
&gt; asking for more information. When things began to be made public in  
&gt; 
&gt; the United States, it was translated newsletters- -again anecdotal--no  
&gt; 
&gt; attached files, obviously; photos that looked produced with 1980s  
&gt; 
&gt; xerox technology (It *was* the 1980s, after all); a lot of second- 
&gt; 
&gt; hand stories and a a few first-hand ones passed from person to person  
&gt; 
&gt; via letters and telephone conversations. Later, there was audio from  
&gt; 
&gt; researchers like Sarah who let her phone messages from Raudive be  
&gt; 
&gt; made public. As I noted, I don&#x27;t have a problem with most of those.  
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously, a voice was recorded on an answering machine and can still  
&gt; 
&gt; be listened to today. I&#x27;d prefer to think that voice really is  
&gt; 
&gt; Raudive, but remember that it was not EVP--it was real phone calls.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; When Macy wrote his book about it, Miracles in the Storm, I was  
&gt; 
&gt; figuratively, if not literally, the the first person who bought it. I  
&gt; 
&gt; thought, &quot;now I am finally going to find out what really happened and  
&gt; 
&gt; be awed by the incredible evidence.&quot; Only Mark&#x27;s book offered none of  
&gt; 
&gt; that for me. I was just looking at the customer reviews for the book  
&gt; 
&gt; on Amazon, because I thought I had written a review of it there at  
&gt; 
&gt; the time. I didn&#x27;t, but here is one from someone who pretty much sums  
&gt; 
&gt; up what I think about it: &quot;Macy&#x27;s book focuses mainly on the  
&gt; 
&gt; personality conflicts that undermined an attempt at high-tech  
&gt; 
&gt; communications with the spirit world. His style is readable and  
&gt; 
&gt; brisk, his tone sincere and unaffected, but he provides little or no  
&gt; 
&gt; evidence that the phenomena he describes are authentic. The main  
&gt; 
&gt; researchers he depicts come off more as enthusiastic dilettantes than  
&gt; 
&gt; serious scientists. For me, Macy forfeits nearly all credibility when  
&gt; 
&gt; he casually declares that the history of the human race can be  
&gt; 
&gt; understood by integrating some of the spirit communications with the  
&gt; 
&gt; writings of Erich von Daniken (p.140)! Von Daniken, of CHARIOTS OF  
&gt; 
&gt; THE GODS fame, is an entirely discredited huckster. If Macy can be  
&gt; 
&gt; persuaded by von Daniken&#x27;s pop-culture writings, he will probably  
&gt; 
&gt; believe just about anything. There is an unfortunate messianic tone  
&gt; 
&gt; pervading the book - the message that a new dawn of humanity is  
&gt; 
&gt; coming, courtesy of the spirit communicators and the mortals who  
&gt; 
&gt; spread their message. You&#x27;ll probably find MIRACLES IN THE STORM  
&gt; 
&gt; enjoyable and easy to read (hence three stars), but it will convince  
&gt; 
&gt; no one who isn&#x27;t already a believer.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I mentioned $cientology wryly, and I should have put in a ;) or  
&gt; 
&gt; something--my bad--but I do stand by the similarity in message and  
&gt; 
&gt; tone. I&#x27;m not conflating the two, I&#x27;m just pointing out what makes me  
&gt; 
&gt; wary, and the sentence, &quot;our progress toward a free, wealthy and sane  
&gt; 
&gt; future in which humanity would have stripped off the chains of  
&gt; 
&gt; intolerance and cruelty&quot; is especially redolent.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In short, while I do believe that we all need to evolve into more  
&gt; 
&gt; loving and spiritual beings, and I have tried all my life to do so  
&gt; 
&gt; with a few limited successes, I still find that becoming &quot;better&quot; is  
&gt; 
&gt; not tantamount to becoming less critical or buying into every  
&gt; 
&gt; messiah&#x27;s momentum. As I&#x27;ve said before, I want to believe, but I  
&gt; 
&gt; will not believe only because I want to. And I&#x27;m not even saying that  
&gt; 
&gt; the whole INIT thing was a fraud. It wasn&#x27;t. But I do think that  
&gt; 
&gt; there are aspects of it that were, or that were highly inflated. And  
&gt; 
&gt; we have to be honest about that or we can&#x27;t really be honest about  
&gt; 
&gt; what is unshakable in paranormal research.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; And this is just my own opinion, and we know what opinions are like,  
&gt; 
&gt; and perhaps I am one. But I hope you will humor me and keep me around  
&gt; 
&gt; because even one of those has its uses. ;)
