I went by Radio Shack on my way home and picked up a 12-820 arm band radio does anyone know how to hack it? 
   
  I saw lots of 12-469's on the shelf and tons of the new all black 12-470's I asked to guy if they had any of the older 12-470's no such luck. 
   
  So from what I hear no one has been able to hack the new 12-470? Has anyone here tried?

  You probably won't find any of the 470's Kay, but always good to keep an eye out. As for 
clicking, I think only the new 469 does that. If you try the 820, please let us know how you 
like it.
