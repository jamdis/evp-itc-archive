Frank is there anyway you can turn up the volume of the box?  Maybe it&#39;s my headphones but it doesn&#39;t seem very loud on the videos?  I love it, thanks so much for sharing :)\n\nFrank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:       Hi all;\n \n Okay, finally got a video converter to work, so up loaded longer videos to you tube. There should be three from today. I&#39;m not usre if the largest one went through, it&#39;s only 6 minutes though. then another is aobut a minute, and the next about 20 seconds. I had to do multiples cuz the random mode wouldn&#39;t work for the first run. the purpose of the videos are to show the world waht the box is supposed to soudn like. I ask them to say my name, and they may have said Frank, but I could hear them say Princess a couple times. \n \n \n Frank-S\n\n  \n---------------------------------\n  Boo!
