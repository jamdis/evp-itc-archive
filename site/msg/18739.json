It&#39;s a nice recorder but they have come out with\nadvanced models for about the same cost as mine. I think they have models in\nthe same series that record 24 hours or more of audio in the Hi-Q position.\nBTW I would only use the Hi-Q position with this machine unless I&#39;m just\nrecording notes to myself.\n\nThe things I like about it are that it records each new audio in a new file,\nit has three general use folders and one that goes by date, has lots of\nfeatures and it&#39;s very easy to use. Batteries last a long time.\n\nThings I don&#39;t like about this particular model are that it only has 6 hours\nof recording time, and you have to use their special program to download the\nfiles to your computer, and it takes a long time. 6 hours of audio takes\nabout 20 minutes to download.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Mon, Sep 20, 2010 at 2:54 AM, usmcmacswife &lt;usmcmacswife@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What brand of recorders do each one of you use to record EVP&#39;s or when you\n&gt; speak to someone with a ghost box?\n&gt;\n&gt; We are looking at changing our recorder.
