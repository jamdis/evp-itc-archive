<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Is this not a scientific feild? Especially a young one? From read these emails it seems all this is, is a lot of he/she said crap. The matter remains (regardless of beliefs) these boxes hold no concrete proof of paranormal. Just because one or two things happen doesnt make it indefinetly perfect. I mean i have faith in them but science teaches us to go over things with a fine tooth comb and you cant with these. That is the point, regardless of beliefs minimal evidence.

&gt;  Have an idea, we will go to bat for you and Frank, Steve, don&#x27;t be afraid, at least talk to an attorney, they won&#x27;t charge you a thing at least for a first consultation, let them know, you and Frank have witnesses, this will damage your reps. Curtis is right this could hang on the net for many years what they said, I have sites from years ago, for my paralegal business from 10 years ago, i have no idea how to even take the thing down anymore, I would go for it, Steve, don&#x27;t even talk to them, the lawyer will tell you not to have any conversation with those people, otherwise it could jeopardize when you go to court. sf

&gt;  
&gt;  Dr Rorke calling me a douce bag at around 20 minutes in.  This is who is representing the field of scientific research.

&gt;  &gt;  That&#x27;s the rub, a cure for cancer would put many thousands out of
&gt;  &gt; work--there will be no cure, too much $$$ in research and toxic treatments
&gt;  &gt; that kill more than the desease. Science in this county is a joke! You can
&gt;  &gt; fund a study to verify whatever results you are willing to pay for.

&gt;  &gt; &gt; Been thinking and decided that we are not wrong in our beliefs.  If we can
&gt;  &gt; &gt; help find a missing child as so many do with $30 shack hacks, than where is
&gt;  &gt; &gt; the harm and the threat.
&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt; Science spends billions of dollars each and every year to find a cure for
&gt;  &gt; &gt; cancer with no results.  I&#x27;m talking about a $30 radio that may help and
&gt;  &gt; &gt; has.  Seems like we have the upper hand in the matter.  Just because our
&gt;  &gt; &gt; methods are not accepted as the norm, does that mean that it serves no
&gt;  &gt; &gt; purp.s..
&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt; If society spent billions of dollars on ghost box research every year, we
&gt;  &gt; &gt; wouldn&#x27;t even be having a conversation.
&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt; p.s.---- Modern science has found a cure for cancer, they just can&#x27;t reveal
&gt;  &gt; &gt; it because they are making a fortune off of treatments.
&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt; p.s.s.----Thanx RJ for p.s.ing that link for that show.....Why are you here
&gt;  &gt; &gt; anyway?
