Thanks Sharon!
                             I labled the Research Conducting Session for those who are doing sessions via Skype, or dual persons via different locations.  Sometimes me and Joel do sessions together or by ourselves.  I know Bruce and Steve also conduct dual sessions.  I can change the title if it is confusing.  I was hoping that once we dedcide to conduct various sessions on the same day and time would could name them accordingly such as Research Project_____/ (example) Conducted by:__________.
   
                            I hope this helps!
   
  Thanks!
  Juli

          Thanks for sharing your log sheet Juli. It's quite complete; the 
only thing I might add is the mood/state of mind of the researcher. 
Also, what do you mean by Research Conducting Session?

Thanks again,
Sharon
