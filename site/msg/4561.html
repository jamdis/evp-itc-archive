&gt; I just received this note today from the AAEVP:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;AA-EVP founder, Sarah Estep, was taken to the Hospital on Christmas
&gt;  day.  The doctors have given her just a few days to live.  Her family
&gt;  hopes to bring her home to care for her until her transition. If you 
&gt; want to be kept up to date on this please email us back at ----------,
&gt;  otherwise we will post general information in a second broadcast.  Our
&gt;  prayers are with Sarah for an easy crossing. We know that there will be
&gt;  many who will be waiting to greet her.  Our prayers are also with her
&gt;  family to help them through this difficult time.
