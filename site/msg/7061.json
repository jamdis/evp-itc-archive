I will be in the San \n&gt; Diego \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and El Centro area from Feb 15 to 19 and I would love to be \nable \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; meet-up with someone from the area who has experience with EVP \n&gt; &gt; &gt; technology.  Mike is sending a box already hacked so we can \nwork \n&gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the box and hopefully get something recorded.  Since I have \n&gt; little \n&gt; &gt; &gt; experience as a newbie to this, I would love to see how someone \n&gt; &gt; puts \n&gt; &gt; &gt; all of it together...recording, analyzing, etc.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   If you have the time and are willing to give a little on-\nthe-\n&gt; &gt; job \n&gt; &gt; &gt; training, please let me know by email.  By the way, in mid June \nI \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will be traveling from Penn. to NC for two weeks and would love \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; get together with folks over in that area.  I will probably be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ordering a mini-box to be sent to my folks house in Allentown, \nso \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will have that to play with.  Let me know.
