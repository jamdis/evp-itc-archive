<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>In the photo section I have just uploaded a few photos for your 
review.  I would certainly like your honest opinion, for my own has 
been reached long ago.  They are photos of what are professed to be 
paranormal in nature, and given the initial viewing I could not 
fathom for a minute that these could in fact be taken as serious data 
and advertised as true spirit photography.

In addition, I have also listed some articles and background 
information on this gentleman who proclaims to be highly experienced 
in the paranormal community, with a long list of degrees under his 
belt.

The dilemma that I am now presented with is the fact that giving the 
paranormal community is based on a belief system that life after dead 
does in fact exist.  With this false material being presented, we 
(the paranormal community as a whole) will never be taken seriously.  
What many paranormal investigators strive for almost seems 
unreachable, and yet those who continue to display false data are a 
direct reflection of all us in the community tarnishing our good 
name.  It&#x27;s bad enough that we have do go up against skeptics 
everyday, but to have self proclaim paranormal experts producing 
faked evidence, certainly is a disgrace to us all, and should apology 
for his dishonesty and misleading those who ever gave him the benefit 
of the doubt.  

    They were my photographs, taken with two different cameras. One 
was an Olympus Trip AF 50, a kind of instamatic type 35mm, and the 
other was a Yashica J-7. In all photos where the anomalies were 
captured, the film type was fuji, ASA 400 color film. The photos were 
scanned in at 400 dpi. The digital copies were enhanced to show up 
better o

You can pretend you didn&#x27;t see the analysis and the
accompanying write up, but you would be lying. It was posted on the
PP site by the Zoellers as well as passed around in an e-mail to
everyone. You also know that the person asked to remain anonymous as
he is still active in the service... He also has ten years of
experience working for a photographic studio.

The photos are an old argument. If you recall, (and let me refresh
your memory as you seem to have selective memory since you came over
to this group) when I gave the originals to John and said I would no
longer respond to any more questions concerning the photos. As I
stated then, let john have them analyzed. He could just as easily
send them to whomever.



When I went to College there was no degree for Audio Engineering. You 
specialized in Acoustics and electrical Engineering.

 The articles listed below were uncovered by Melanie K. Hale and have 
come into question regarding the same.  Numbers don&#x27;t lie, I guess 
people do.  Mr. Roundtree seems to think  that it is right to lead us 
to believe he is something he&#x27;s not, and that all published material 
is his for the taking. 
 
  So I did a little math and found the actual percentage of original 
material in each of David Roundtree&#x27;s papers I linked.  I did this by 
opening in word, then selecting &quot;Tools&quot;&gt;&quot;Word Count&quot; and wrote down 
the total for Words.  Then I deleted all linked materials and did the 
same &quot;Tools&quot; &gt; &quot;Word Count&quot;.  Then I took the second number and 
divided it by the first number.  Here are the results linked to the 
original document on David&#x27;s site:
 
Analog_or_digital. doc  =  38% original material  62% taken from 
other sources
 
Biofeedback_ Experiment. doc = 10% original material  90% taken from 
other sources
 
EVP_Project_ Phase_1.doc = 31% original material  69% taken from 
other sources
 
EVP_Project_ Phase_2.doc = 43% original material  57% taken from 
other sources
 
Orbs-The_Search_ for_the_Truth. doc = 32% original material  68% 
taken from other sources
 
The_Magic_that_ is_Light. doc = 0% original material  100%
