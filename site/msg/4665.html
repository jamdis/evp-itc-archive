<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This statement was taken from a blog that was sent to me by steve. He 
came across it while web surfing.

It is indicitive of the attitude 90% of the paranormal community has 
toward box evp research.

I suggest we all memorise it because as box researchers this will be 
our most formitable object.

The first thought that comes to mind about this whole &#x27;box&#x27; thing is 
what are the chances that spirits would comunicate through such a box.  
I mean there are so many different radio frequencies the chances that 
anything would or would want to use the am or fm bands seems very 
unlikely.
