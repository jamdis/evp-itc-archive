Exactly. And it may even be that it's both-sometimes it is us, but once in =
a while and actual entity comes through. But until I can really study it ov=
er a period time, I am just not convinced either way.

  I tried an Ouija board once. My brother =
and I were given one by my grandmother, who found it in her attic. After as=
king many questions and getting all sorts of answers that ranged from gibbe=
rish to the totally absurd, I think we decided there was something in our j=

  That may not always be the case, though. I think if answers of some sor=
t were given involving something that no one present would have the faintes=
t idea about, and they turned out to be true or valid, then it might demons=
trate spirit communication.

    The reason I have my doubts is that you have to be touching the planc=

    But th=

     When it comes to the Ouija, I just want to study it to find out if it =

      I agree that we all have the ability fo=
