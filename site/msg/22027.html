<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Do not &#x27;reply all&#x27; - this is a bulk email

Everyone knows by now that I have terminal cancer. The dr&#x27;s give me 
about a year and that was back in May. I&#x27;m ok with it but all my funds - 
and future funds - are going to my final arrangements and affairs. I 
want everything completed before hand :-)

Please don&#x27;t think me crass but I have an appeal. I want to do a video 
journal of what is going on. I want to continue this in and out of the 
hospital and ultimately, to the end. Someone will manage the camera 
after that until after all is complete. My friend Mimi Burns has offered 
her acoustic version of her Irish band for a wake :-)

Sometimes writing comes hard since they changed my meds. This is one 
reason why I gave up the short stories. My appeal to all of you is, is 
there anyone who could let me have or lend me an ir video cam to 
accomplish my goal? I can try to work out some payment arraingment with 
those who want compensated. My pc is old so it would have to be one 
where I can upload vie usb or memory chip. There are so many expenses 
going on in my life right now that I can barely keep up with rent. 
Passing is an expensive task!

I&#x27;m trying to keep as positive as possible but it gets hard. I seldom 
hit FB anymore. The ir is because many times I do things in the dark and 
my place is haunted. There are spirits floating around everywhere here!

Ok, that&#x27;s it. Hope I don&#x27;t lose any friends over this.

Your friend,

Mick
