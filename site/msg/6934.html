<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m glad my site made you interested in this, i guess it&#x27;s 
working !!!  We just have to get the word out there.

&gt; &gt;  That one file &quot;What are you to me?&quot; A man answers clearly i 
believe
&gt; &gt;  says &quot;Nothing&quot;. That is a real EVP, probably a class A and that 
did
&gt; &gt;  not come from the box.
&gt; 
&gt; It must be a Class B, then, as I am hearing &quot;husband&quot;.  That fits 
with 
&gt; the other one where he says I&#x27;m his wife.  He has been trying to 
&gt; convince me for over a year that I am the reincarnation of his long 
dead 
&gt; spouse, so I was quite intrigued to get these as some of the 
results 
&gt; from my very first day trying ITC work.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  That was spoken directly into your recorder. I
&gt; &gt;  get them on occasion, i feel that only happens with a grounded 
spirit
&gt; &gt;  in a location and is confused by the box....Maybe (I don&#x27;t Know) 
It
&gt; &gt;  sounds somewhat logical though.
&gt; 
&gt; Or it could just be that I have been nagging him to hear his 
voice.  
&gt; Like I said, I&#x27;d never managed to get even one evp out of him in 15 
&gt; months of trying.  He&#x27;s pretty clever, so I couldn&#x27;t imagine that 
he 
&gt; couldn&#x27;t figure out how to.  The sense I was getting from him was 
that 
&gt; since he was shot through the throat during the Civil War, he was 
&gt; concerned that he would sound scary if I ever heard him.  It 
actually 
&gt; means a lot to me that he finally let me hear him in his own 
voice.  I 
&gt; guess he now trusts me not to freak out.  As if I ever did.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Anyway, Great Files and welcome to the group !!!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!  Actually, it was your site that convinced me to break down 
and 
&gt; give ITC work a try.
