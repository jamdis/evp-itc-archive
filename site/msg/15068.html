No, that's not what I mean. By nature EM waves don't normally make sound. T=
he HAARP issue in the NW is believe to be caused by some harmonic of the ac=
tual EM wave. This is what I mean by secondary effect. EM waves can still e=
ffect the physical, which is the reason microwaves can cook you if the powe=
r is amped high enough or causes a birds to twitch in its transmission beam=
. I have stepped into a microwave beam at moderate power in while in the mi=
litary. It doesn't hurt (at least at the power it was at) but it sure made =
me feel very strange. Of course microwaves have very short wavelengths comp=
ared to VLF, ULF or SLF.

A mistake that a lot of people make is thinking that there are two differen=
t types of energy at work when it comes to sound waves and electromagnetic =
waves. The only thing that seperates them is frequency and power. Radio wav=
es are radio waves because they occupy a certain block of the electromagnie=

h much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic waves can penetrate almost any=
thing because of their wavelengths. The shorter the wavelength the more way=
s we can shield against them.
=A0
Think of microwaves. These are also a typ=
e of radio and telemetry transmitting wave but the waves also have a physic=
al effect on our environment by causing molecules to speed up, which create=
s heat. A little lower than this is IR or infrared it too can cause physica=
l objects to heat up but usually it just causes molecules to rotate in plac=
e. All physical things give off IR light. Its a way the total system conser=
ves energy by spontaneously emitting IR radiation.

Here is some food for thought. I am curren=

=A0
It was me and a=
nother girl teammate=A0present in the room. I picked up a 3rd female voice =
on my digital voice recorder that I carry with me. We were standing right n=
ext to another digital video recorder that I leave beside my night vision c=
amera. That recorder did not pick up this 3rd voice. I have asked the girl =
that was with me to check her recording to see if she picked it up.
=A0
I h=
ave long felt the true EVP does not come from sound waves in the environmen=
t, or then it wouldn't be EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow EVP's are a=
ppearing directly on the recordings.
=A0
This instance with the recorders m=
ay back that theory up. That other recorder should have picked that voice u=
p if it were sound waves in the environment.
=A0
I am attaching the clip of=
 this 3rd voice. The=A0file that is named=A0"01-02-17 Clip" is the full cli=
p.=A0You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah", and then another comes in righ=
t after that. I think I know what it says.
=A0
Again, I was live monitoring=
 my audio, but still did not hear this until playback. It isn't clear, so I=
 am not as excited about it as my one's from the last investigation.

I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wav=
e and demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It works off the =
heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one anoth=
er in frequency then if you add or subtract them together you get a beat fr=
equency or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal=
 at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic fre=
quency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate difference=A0frequency at=
 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an ex=
ample, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by tu=
rning them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP were generated withi=
n a few inches of the recorder.
=A0
We are able to reproduce this affect in=
 not only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and au=
dio as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce called the "audio sp=
otlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.

I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demod=
ulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne =
principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequ=
ency then if you add or subtract them together you get a beat frequency or =
alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz a=
nd you have an electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 4=
5KHz then you will have a intermediate difference frequency at 9KHz, w=
ell within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, b=
ut all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turning th=
em on. From this theory I always felt that EVP were generated within a few =
inches of the recorder.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>We are able to reprodu=
ce this affect in not only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with=
 acoustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce cal=
led the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.</DIV>

<DIV>I am curio=
us if anyone with a microphone wired to a remote site has ever gotten any E=
VP in real time.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I took part in an i=
nvestigation of Ashmore Estates, near Ashmore IL, on Saturday night. We had=
 six video cameras set up in the three halls of the building. The video for=
 all was being monitored and recorded at a central location. Alas=
, we did not have microphones at the camera sites conected to the central l=
ocation. I wonder what we might have heard if we did?</DIV>
