Wow! I just listened again, and I heard that.
   
  Ok for those of you that have experience. What would prompt an answer like that? Why would they not be able to find my dad?  
   
  I have often wondered this scenario. What if he reincarnates before I die. Then when I die, I can not see him. Does it work that way?

  It sound like the "Yeah" response was to the name Shay Clark.
