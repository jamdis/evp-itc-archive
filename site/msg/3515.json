I don&#39;t know Chris Moon\n&gt; but I have heard him on C2C and have read his opinions.  I am always weary\n&gt; of anyone claiming to be one of a &quot;chosen few&quot; and using fear to further\n&gt; their arguments.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; The fear-based reasoning&#39;s and omni-potent subterfuge employed by Mr. Moon\n&gt; only tells me to ignore him and anyone else like him.  There is no manual or\n&gt; class  this research is done by Joe-Schmo in his basement and therefore\n&gt; open to many different interpretations and methodologies.  Take the good \n&gt; delete the bad.  I believe in Karma  even if she is only my dog digging in\n&gt; my garden :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; k\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\n&gt; Frank Sumption\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, November 29, 2007 1:19 PM\n&gt; To: Group\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Just teh fact!\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi All;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  First, the thing, the equiment I make, and experiment with as a device for\n&gt; ITC, Instrumental Trans-Communication, also now know as Franks&#39; Box, or the\n&gt; Ghost box (that&#39;s also an audio devioce,a nd photography device) was never\n&gt; described by me, it&#39;s inverntor, as the &quot;Telephone to the Dead&quot;, that label\n&gt; was put on my equipment, loaned to Moon for testing, he was the first to\n&gt; want to test the box, he is not, and was not designated by me as the\n&gt; &quot;primary tester&quot;.  In fact he has yet to pay anything for the boxes he has,\n&gt; or any of the other equipment he &quot;barrowed&quot;, such as the Sony pocket size\n&gt; cassette recorder, and Tarot CD, he still has. Moon is the one that claims\n&gt; only he, or a designated trainee can properly interpret the output of the\n&gt; box, despite the fact that I have stated numerous times that I made the box\n&gt; for anyone to use, and one&#39;s results are any no better or supercede in\n&gt; anyway the results of anyone else. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Now when someone claims that these new system don&#39;t work, or only get the\n&gt; evil spirits, and even open portals so demons, or what not can enter, they\n&gt; are lying, and attempting to keep the use of any equipment,  and methods of\n&gt; spirit communication for themselves. The motive being priofit,a s far as I\n&gt; can tell. The portal thing is Hollywood! I use my equimpemt in my basement,.\n&gt; and have sinece 2000, amnd have never expereinced anything I could call evil\n&gt; beside soem cussing, nakme calling voices, which is hardly threatening\n&gt; except to maybe 13 year old girl. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  I must point put, because of preivisou threats, that slander is stating\n&gt; something in public about a person that is knowingly untrue. So for anyone\n&gt; comptemplating such threats I can say only-- Bring It, I will have\n&gt; everything you own!\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; You keep typing, we keep giving.

Put him &quot;out of business&quot; in making money/profits from YOUR box! This seem unethical in what he&#39;s now doing, don&#39;t ya think?   My 2c worth.  Makes me annoyed!  =Judy=                           . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."}
