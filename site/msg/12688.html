<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>While reading a book about spirit communication, there was a chapter 
which referenced the Faraday Cage.  So... after reading it I decided to 
try out what the book suggested and placed my Radio Shack Hack 12-470 
Ghost Box into my microwave oven (in the OFF position) and ran a sweep 
in the AM and FM mode.
The AM mode did receive much less but a few audio snippets did make 
their way through.  The FM mode was a different story. No frequencies 
at all made it through... just white noise as each FM frequency was 
reached during the sweep.
As I always do... I made a short video of both modes being sweeped.
You can see it, here:
