I have very \nlittle experience and would appreciate some help.\n\nWith my limited knowledge in electronics I built a white noise \ngenerator (with high frequency filtering) and I&#39;m trying to use it to \nrecord voices with the PC/sound blaster. I did few attempts and so \nfar I didn&#39;t found anything unusual. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m doing \neverything right. The recorded sound is very noisy (as expected) and \nI&#39;m not sure I would be able to detect any voice, even using headphones.\n\nWhat sound sources produce best results? Does anyone have experience \nin using a white noise generator?\nDoes the sound have to be recorded in a analogical tape recorder or \nit can be recorded digitally?\n\nThank you,\nJaime\n\n\nSend instant messages to your online friends http://uk.messenger.yahoo.com"}
