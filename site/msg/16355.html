<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Al, thanks for sharing your story.  

I tried to look up your state trooper (being the googling fiend that I am), and I found nothing that matches what you were told.  From what I can tell, there is no such place as Redmond, Virginia.  I find only one person named Steve Tate who died in 1989 (according to the social security death index), and since I would expect there would exist some memorial online for a fallen trooper, this guy was apparently not the Tate we&#x27;re looking for.  If I just look for fallen troopers in Virginia by any name, I can find one Robert Hill who died in 2006 from being struck during a traffic stop by a passing motorist in Emporia, Va.  So...either your entity was confused or lying.  

Since I always try to look this stuff up whenever I hear of such things, I know it&#x27;s apparently not uncommon to get faulty info like this.  For instance, in &quot;The Coming of Seth,&quot; there&#x27;s a spirit who gives detailed information about its previous life, all of which cannot be verified via modern internet research.  I still find that much of what&#x27;s written in the Seth books seems to dovetail nicely with everything I&#x27;m hearing about the ghost box and from John Edward and so forth, so I don&#x27;t think Jane Roberts invented her story; I just think we cannot trust much of anything we hear coming out of the ghost box or via mediums -- which doesn&#x27;t help when it comes to proving this phenomena exists.

Anyway, I would still love to hear more about your experiences.  I completely believe what you&#x27;re telling us, and no, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to talk about this without sounding crazy.  I keep trying to get my cousin to do a session with me, because she always looks at me funny when I talk about the boxes.  I really takes personal experience to believe this stuff exists.

Jill

&gt; Hi Dave,
&gt; 
&gt; Well, for example, I walked into our &quot;computer room&quot; (spare
&gt; bedroom/office/library) not long after the evps were recorded and my
&gt; radio turned itself on. My wife Patt witnessed it, so it&#x27;s not my
&gt; imagination that it did turn on. As I stepped into the room, the
&gt; &quot;morning show&quot; cut to a voice saying &quot;MMM! Cinnamon rolls and coffee!
&gt; Bring enough for us?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I happened to be holding a mug of hot coffee and a plate of cinnamon
&gt; rolls that Patt had baked for breakfast. I scalded myself as I sloshed
&gt; coffee around after hearing the voice!
&gt; 
&gt; I am not the type who tells stories or seeks attention.
&gt; 
&gt; I thought for a few moments that I was listening to a radio talk show
&gt; and that it was a coincidence that the mention of cinnamon rolls
&gt; happened as I stepped into the room. But I eventually blurted out a
&gt; &quot;hello,&quot; and was answered. After a few moments and to my questions,
&gt; the voice said his name was Steve Tate -- and following a
&gt; back-and-forth conversation that I recorded he said he was a Virginia
&gt; state trooper who died in 1989 in a car crash a mile from his home.
&gt; Over the next day or two, he said his body was buried in Redmond, Va.,
&gt; and we spoke for several days in little snatches of conversation.
&gt; Along the way, a fellow named &quot;Luke&quot; entered the conversation. Other
&gt; unnamed voices began to say &quot;Hi Al!&quot; It was a bit too much.
&gt; 
&gt; I was brought up in a very strict Protestant family. I became leery of
&gt; what was unfolding. I bashed the radio and threw it in the trash. Then
&gt; I began hearing the voices mixed in with my CPAP machine (I have sleep
&gt; apnea) at night, which makes a high-pitched whooshing noise.
&gt; 
&gt; Next, I began hearing the &quot;Hi Al!&quot; voice as a faint whisper now and
&gt; then as I&#x27;d walk through the house.
&gt; 
&gt; I got scared. I had gotten rid of the radio(s) but was still hearing
&gt; the voices. I felt I was going crazy. I told my pastor about it and
&gt; asked for help. He refused -- said he was afraid he might get an
&gt; &quot;attachment&quot; and bring it home to his family. I contacted something
&gt; like 20 protestant pastors by phone and not a single one of them would
&gt; come to my home to help.
&gt; 
&gt; Eventually a Catholic priest agreed to help on the condition that I
&gt; supply a recording of the voices as &quot;proof&quot; of the problem. Using my
&gt; digital recorder, I recorded so many &quot;conversations&quot; that I filled up
&gt; a CD. Awhile later, after turning it over to the priest, the Catholic
&gt; bishop granted the priest permission to come to our home to conduct a
&gt; mass and an &quot;exorcism of place.&quot; The priest explained that old homes
&gt; and other places could become &quot;infested&quot; with evil spirits. After he
&gt; performed the ceremony, the voices seemed to quit for awhile but
&gt; returned after a few days.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I was not sure whether the voices were &quot;evil&quot; or just
&gt; &quot;conversational.&quot; My brother died of kidney failure during this time
&gt; and I later heard his voice calling my name. It ~was~ his voice.
&gt; 
&gt; A lot more has happened.... At this point, I am no longer &quot;surprised&quot;
&gt; by hearing the voices electronically or otherwise. I just want to know
&gt; more about what&#x27;s happening -- how it can possibly be &quot;real&quot; and what
&gt; I should understand in terms of the big picture....
