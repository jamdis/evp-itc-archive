The problem we run into is what actually constitutes evidence of spirit com=
munication? This is the heart of the matter. As I said in the other thread,=
 one cannot simply assume that unexplained information defacto proves spiri=
t communication or even external sources. 
The reason is simple. It is quit=
e possible for internal and/or external influences to be exerted in=A0an ex=
periment. Let us say you are doing an experiment and you are the only parti=
cipant. We'll set aside the obvious challenge of reporting credibility for =
the moment. How do you truly know it's not you and even worse, how do you k=
now who in fact the external communicator is? Simply knowing facts is not s=
ufficient. Especially in cases where PK may be in play (such as the Ouija e=
xample) a remote PK agent could be influencing the planchette. Before rulin=
g this out, consider that the very notion that anyone is moving anything is=
 problematic for many people. And spirit communication pushes the edge of t=
he belief envelope for others. In the end, all of this is some form of anom=
alous phenomena. You could know things of which you are unaware. Consider t=
hat you might be clairvoyant and not even realize it. If you were to extern=
alize this through a latent PK
 mechanism, bingo, you are the agent and the=
 source of information. Yet to all appearances the information came from el=
sewhere and you therefore presume it must be external to yourself, which in=
 this example would not be true..
=A0
I was taking advantage of the physica=
l nature of the experiment I proposed. Unfortunately this is what is requir=
ed=A0if one wishes to remove=A0reliance on belief systems alone. This is wh=
at many in the field=A0are looking for. From my own work with mediums and o=
ther sensitives, I have learned the perils and the potential pitfalls with =
our own perceptual systems, memories and recall. All of this works against =
us in even the most trivial experimental set up, which is unfortunate but t=
rue. This is yet one more reason to exercise caution with solely anecdotal =
experimental outcomes. You will find that independent historical validation=
 is actualy pretty tricky, as I have said before, because it often is not s=
imply factual in nature. It tends to be more about emotions and feelings an=
d that's where specifically identifying an individual gets dicey.
