<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was using manual mode to test out the last couple tuner moduals, 
and it seems to have advantages, maybe it&#x27;s the human touch element. 
They seem to be able to track it easier, same with linear mode. I was 
wondering if they can access the tube electronics easier as well. I 
should be able to dig up a tube radio around here somewhere.

&gt; thats my point on the subject too.... i have comments that make up 
a full sentances... of 5 words... and you can hear me scanning past 4 
to 8 channels ( cant remember exactly how many) but i remember saying-
 how could i get the same voice across 5 stations or what not? theres 
just no way....
&gt;   i do love manual sweeps but i gotta tell ya i sure lust after 
some of the fancier ghost-boxes! lol

&gt;           Yeah, manually sweeping gives the user the opportunity of 
being a 
&gt; part of the whole EVP experience i feel. Same goes with using sound 
&gt; soap for evp&#x27;s. The GE radio i use for the manual sweeps sounds 
like 
&gt; the old Frank&#x27;s boxes in random mode, with the treble turned up it 
&gt; even sounds like it has an echo box. It has a good sound and given 
a 
&gt; bunch of clear answers to me as well, you can hear how fast i&#x27;m 
&gt; sweeping the dial yet i get the same voice with a full 
&gt; sentence....weird. If you scan up and down the band that fast, how 
&gt; do you get the same voice?

&gt; &gt; Haven&#x27;t posted here in a while, but i&#x27;m using a manual sweep 
radio 
&gt; i 
&gt; &gt; picked up at a flea market for $3 and i&#x27;m getting some good 
&gt; results. 
&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s a GE radio from the 40&#x27;s that has a great tuning dial, it&#x27;s 
&gt; all 
&gt; &gt; i&#x27;ve been using lately.
