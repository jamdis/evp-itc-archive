I also have other boxes for sale:\n\nRS 12-587----$32 plus shipping-(Actual Cost of unit)\n\nMiniBox Plus----$400 plus shipping-(I paid $550 originally)\n\nJoe&#39;s Box----$150.00-(I paid $250 originally)\n\nMiniBox 2----$150\n\nLet me know if anyone is interested in any or all of the boxes, i need to free\nup some space in my home and am offer them at a discounted rate. I rarely have\ntime to use all of these, so they must go. I figured that i would offer the\ngroup first before putting them on Ebay.\n\n-Steve H."}
