<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Don!  Though I expect the quality would be better with the
scanner, I am able to read what you uploaded after zooming in a couple
times, and with no other processing of the jpg.  So I think if you go
this route, it would work.

&gt; Rather than risk the scanner and the bending required, I thought
about using my camera.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried taking a single page at a time but even in Macro mode, the
type was out of focus.
&gt; 
&gt; So I just uploaded 4 pages (2 pages per image) of my first attempt
with the camera.
&gt; 
&gt; I wanted to know if it was good enough. If so, I&#x27;ll redo those and
the remaining pages with brighter light and keeping my thumb out of
the picture :))
&gt; 
&gt; If if it not good enough then I&#x27;ll try the scanner. Although I was
able to read them just fine so it should be good enough.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me know,

&gt;             Yeah Don you can upload them in the photo section as
jpg&#x27;s hardly any space taken up there (the file section is the one
thats always full) and if it sets our limit over then I am sure we can
post it other places as well like esnips.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I found the book.
&gt; 
&gt; It is called &quot;The Diary and Sundry Observations of Thomas Alva
Edison&quot; the copyright for the edition I have is 1948. Since only a
limited number of 1st printings have Chapter 8, &quot;The Realms Beyond&quot;,
then I suspect 1948 would be the date of the first printing.
&gt; 
&gt; Each chapter ends with the year Mr. Edison wrote it (it is primarily
his diary). The part about spirit communication is dated 1922.
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously a 61 year old book is a bit fragile so I&#x27;ll start trying
to scan those pages but I&#x27;m not going to hurt the book for it.
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose I just post them as JPGs in an email? There is not a
place to upload files here is there? Well I know there is but I
thought we were not supposed to use it.

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the link! Very interesting. I went to Edison&#x27;s place down
here in Florida in search of any information on the subject.
&gt; I found nothing. It was rumored that the executors of the estate had
anything of the sort removed.
&gt; I lost both my grandad and an uncle last month. People change their
minds about the afterlife. I&#x27;ve seen it first hand!
&gt; How old was Edison when this article was written?
&gt; Thanks

&gt; 
&gt; I have one of a handful of the Edison Autobiography that has the
last chapter with his thoughts on the great beyond. His family had
that version of the biography recalled and reissued it without the
last chapter.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway in this last chapter, Edison alludes to a way to communicate
with the dead but he never says he did it. He simply hypothesizes on
how it could be done and the fact that the dead are just on a
different wavelength than the living.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, no links... This is from that old fashioned thing called a
book :))
&gt; 
&gt; I can tell you how to find your own copy though if you wish. I need
to find the actual page count from my copy but I went to amazon&#x27;s used
books and asked every seller how many pages their copy was. The first
one to respond with the correct (bigger) number, that was the one I
bought.
&gt; 
&gt; Don
&gt; 
&gt; PS but don&#x27;t
&gt;  spend alot. The info in the last chapter is not worth much.

&gt; I suppose ultimately, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if Edison made a
&gt; telephone to the dead or not. Modern researchers in this field will
&gt; have to stand on their own results anyway, and if they&#x27;ve managed to
&gt; discover something that Edison never achieved, good for them!
&gt; 
&gt; I have also heard varied claims: that Edison did make this box; that
&gt; Edison was working on it but never finished it; that Edison was joking
&gt; when he mentioned working on it. So for my own sake, I&#x27;d like to know
&gt; the real story.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have a link to where you got your information from his
&gt; assistants and staff, I would really like to read it. Please make
&gt; sure it is as close to the source material as possible, and not
&gt; someone quoting someone quoting an article. For example, here is a
&gt; link to the actual New York times article on Edison discussing his
&gt; views of life after death: 
&gt; http://query. nytimes.com/ mem/archive- free/pdf? _r=1&amp;res=

&gt; 
&gt; That is the kind of link I&#x27;d be hoping for regarding your statements.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any info.
