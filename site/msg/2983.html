Hey Zack:
                    I have had the schematics for about 2 years now, but I am not mechanical inclined myself to build one.  I have strong convictions regarding the boxes, having been up close and personal (shall we say) on several different occasions.  I have analyzed EVP from many locations and still strongly believe that the box does not work for everyone.  I believe that your intentions are good giving our conversations in the past and wish you the very best with assembly.
   
  See, I believe that the guilds know what your intentions are, and the sincerity behind your work and come through to those who have their best interest at heart.  I know that you probably think I am crazy, but in viewing some who currently posses the devices and having changed their path for their own agenda, its not going to be what they in vision it to be.  I think they could open Pandora Box and the world in which they know it will come crashing down upon their own accord.
   
  I know the other side knows, and will help those in furthering their studies as they see fit.  I can only say, that the respect I have for the boxes and Frank will always remain, and I can lay my head upon my pillow at night with my integrity in take.  When I should have a box, I will know, and until then, I have the pleasure to listen and read everyones data and studies!
   
  Juli

Hi Juli,

Good to see you here!

Frank has graciously provided the schematics and other data for building 
one. He also gave some info on modifications recently. We were 
discussing making a circuit board that uses small surface-mount parts. I 
can make boards that are far cheaper than ExpressPCB.

Adjusting them is another matter. I have some of this work planned as 
"winter projects" when I can't get outside and do things. I am guessing 
learning how to adjust them properly is hard-won experience.

I do agree they should not just be given to someone who has no idea how to 
use them. If I end up being able to make the boards easily, it would be 
just for this group. I wouldn't make any money at it, either.

Zack

For the unknown to correspond these messages are of great importance, and not all people can not understand the depth in the meanings. I can only hope that they do not work for those who are not worthy, and that those who shall come in possession who are sincere will utilize it in all position manners never expecting personal gain!
