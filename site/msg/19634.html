I've seen live webcast of ITC sessions where GB output is fed di=

on LiveSciFi which is run by Tim Wood, he also thought there was some kind =

So if anyone has =
Audition, just feed Box output right in your computer and see what happens.=
 I wanted to try it tonight but I have Audacity and the spectragraph featur=
