<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was highly skeptical, and highly critical of box-type communication.
I began looking all over the internet, youtube, etc... wondering why
people put so much stock into these specialized tuners or modified
radios. It then occurred to me that I was being skeptical of something
that I have never sat down and tried. Not having much money, I went
with the shack hack method. My first session was phenomenal, and
although I don&#x27;t know how mystery voices can accurately and
contextually answer my questions posed to what is, in effect, a
malfunctioning radio, I am only left with the knowledge that it works.
At least it worked for me. Believe me, it drives me insane trying to
figure out the mechanism by which spirits would be able to communicate
with a box spitting out chunks of broadcast fragments. That being
said, though, it really isn&#x27;t anymore of a leap of faith than the
coil-induction theory of evp collection, I mean, how would a spirit
know how to manipulate focused emf fields to produce corresponding
frequency. 

As to what the voices might be, I have to say as far as I am
concerned, the jury is still out. I am wondering if there isn&#x27;t some
sort of latent PK element in play by the operator, it would certainly
explain why the information is so accurate and specific. I am working
on a &quot;blind&quot; test to study that to my own satisfaction. The phenomenon
may very well be external entities trying to make contact, and if so,
that is just as cool. Either way, having thought the concept was
absurd at one time, I simply gave it a shot and the results were
undeniable. Honestly, subsequent attempts at ITC with the shack hack
have produced mixed results, none with the in-your-face accuracy of
the first time. Suffice it to say it is dissapointing I cannot have
that kind of success every time, but I can certainly say that there is
 a force at work here and my curiosity is understandibly aroused.

thanks
Andy

&gt; But, are there any files on this group where any of you believe you
&gt; are communicating with a spirit?  Frank&#x27;s box seems to really force
&gt; all kinds of &quot;voices&quot; out of the airwaves and I am not yet buying it.
&gt; 
&gt; Does any one have anything constructive to say to us in regard to
&gt; actual paranormal investigation via Frank&#x27;s box, rather than mildly
&gt; entertaining techno-tweaking? 
&gt; 
&gt; I was on a multi-group investigation at an old historical mission in
&gt; Santa Barbara a week ago, for instance and watched the frank&#x27;s box at
&gt; work for the first time.
&gt; 
&gt; Sure, I heard a few things that sounded obviously like radio, but we
&gt; did hear a very eerie woman&#x27;s voice screaming when we were in the main
&gt; chapel room, and THAT got my attention..  But everything else I have
&gt; heard so far in the files here is not striking me as the voice of any
&gt; apparition, due to the weakness of quality. 
&gt; 
&gt; If you&#x27;re still reading this, I have to tell you I have had striking
&gt; results in my own home, simply letting a recording device roll, and if
&gt; you&#x27;re not yet interested in hearing these samples, I guess you&#x27;re
&gt; more into the box than the afterlife and that&#x27;s YOU, not me! :)
&gt; 
&gt; LOVE,
&gt; 
&gt; Katherine.
