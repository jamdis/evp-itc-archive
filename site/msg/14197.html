        Yep, that's exactly=
 what that comparison does.  It compares each and every byte (all their 
  =
      bits) from file to file.  If the same bytes are in both files, in the=
 same places, they are the same.  One tiny little difference, and it tells =

                  If the audio had been resampled, you could expect less=
 bytes, or different bytes, but not the same number of the same bytes.  Tha=

                    Yeah-I know about the file size comparison=
. Obviously if the file size became smaller, we know for sure there has bee=
n loss, except if the file had been saved to a lossless compression type, s=
uch as from RAW to TIFF in photo files.

                    I just don't f=
ully trust the bit comparison because I don't trust that the bytes haven't =
been resampled using interpolation, such as we discussed earlier. But that =
is largely because I have no clue at that level of things what is actually =
going on.

                    All I know about this I know from Graphic De=

 to use to compare. I no nothing about actual programming language, Unix, o=

                            They are not necessarily =
the same bytes, but I was proposing a quick check just to see if the files =
were in the same ballpark.  Look at it the other way: if the number of byte=
s were DIFFERENT, than you'd know the files HAD changed, and you could stop=
 testing.  But if the number of bytes are the same, it tends to indicate th=
e files are likely the same, but you still need a low level file comparison=
 to be sure.

                            My method is to compare the files=
 using the CMP command in unix.  There are many programs to compare files, =
but you have to be careful not to use one that does a line-by-line compare =
(or a comparison meant for text files), since text files can be different a=
t a low level, but look essential the same in an editor (because of the way=
 spaces and tabs and new lines work between editors and platforms).

      =
                      But anyway, the way to compare is with a program that=
 can compare binary files, not text files.

     A file's content, it's integrity, is simply the bytes (and their bits)=
 in the file.  If the file's content integrity is changed, that is, by defi=
nition, changing the bytes.  If the bytes in there are not changed, then th=
at integrity has not changed.

                                It is possib=
le to mess with other things about a file (like its name, its suffix, or it=
s ownership) but this does not effect the contents, and so would not affect=
 that integrity, or the sound of the file (assuming you could read it at al=
l after changing the ownership, or the suffix, etc).

                     =
           When you do your tests, if you cannot do a bit level comparison,=
 I would recommend at least checking the file sizes.  If they are identical=
, there is a very high probability that the content has not changed.

                                For executables, you may b=
e right. However, for wav files, the compression during email is not loss l=
ess. 

                                I used to think as you do, in that t=
he emailed attachment of a wav file would not loose anything. After a lengt=
hy discourse with another member here, I learned that I was wrong. The reas=
on why I did not realize it in the first place is that when I would email a=
 wav file, I would intentionally keep it in very small segments, to keep fi=
le size down. This was just for ease of transfer. But because of this, I ha=
d not experienced any noticeable loss.

                                Now=
 it may be in some cases, depending on the servers or what have you that th=
e file goes through, that the loss may be less or more. But once the attach=
ment is downloaded, the quality has been found to be less then the original=
 wav.

                                Again though you can only really tel=

                                T=
he kind of compression that occurs during an email attachment is "lossless"=
: it compress the file cleverly without losing information.  For example, i=
f I had a program in some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it could co=
mpress it.  But if it lost even one bit, the resulting exe file would not e=
xecute again after it was uncompressed on the other side.

                =
                This kind of compression does things like looking for commo=
n patterns in the file, and replacing them with a token.  A rough example w=
ould be if it found "Howdy Neighbor" in a file 20 times, it could replace a=
ll the occurances with say $HN1.  And also write a little dictionary in the=
re someplace that says "$HN1=3DHowdy Neighbor".

                          =
      When the file gets to its destination it can be uncompressed, and all=
 occurences of $HN1 are replaced with "Howdy Neighbor".  So it was compress=
ed (instead of 14 characters each, it only needed 4, plus the dictionary), =
but lost no data.

                                Some formats, like jpeg =
and mp3. are not lossless.  Depending on the level of compression, some lev=
el of data is lost, and so cannot be recovered or reconstructed later.

                                Another thing:

                 =
               I recently found this out. When you email a file, if it is n=
ot saved as a compressed format, the email filtering process will actually =
compress the file automatically.

                                So even i=
f you have attached a wav. file, it will loose resolution over the email pr=
ocess. It will not sound exactly the same as the original wav. file. How mu=
ch it differs depends on the size of the file you are attaching. If it is a=
 very large file, it will sound much different.

                          =
      The only exception to this is if the wav. file is small enough that t=
he filtering process will ignore it. It has to be pretty small though, like=
 under 1 MB (I am not exactly sure of the threshold).

                    =
            The best way to share files over the internet if you want them =
as close to the original as possible is to upload them directly to a websit=

-up the data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking a picture of a field of flowe=
rs, and beginning to add levels or pixelization to the picture.  Soon, you =
would not be able to tell there were flowers there at all.  You would see a=
 lot of colored blocks.

                                Or in the other di=
rection, imagine you are looking at a competely randomize bunch of pixes on=
 your screen: a complete screen of truely random static snow.  Pixelizing t=
his, after a while, you would again start to see colored blocks.

         =
                       What's happening is that it is processing an area of=
 the image, taking (for instance) the average value of that entire area, an=
d replacing all the blocks in that area with the average.  In video process=
ing, this would result in a field of multi-colored flowers being replaced b=
y, for instance, a big greyish-bluish block, with no resemblance to flowers=
.  In the noise example, it maybe replace all the random pixels with anothe=
r big greyish-bluish block.  If you did not know beforehand what the origin=
al picture was, you couldn't tell whether your pixelized image was really a=
 field of flowers, a chevy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixel=
s.

                                It works the same with the sound files.=
  Taking something as complex as speech, and replacing frequencies with the=
ir averages, loses the speech the farther you go, until you head strange fl=
uctuating square waves.  Doing the same to random static will eventually pr=
oduce the same thing.  And random fluctuating square waves can sound a bit =
like speech - or at least, you could have fun sharing with each other what =
you thing they 'sound like'.

                     Be a bit careful of formats like mp3 if you are doing =
a detailed analysis of the sounds though.   While some formats (like wav) c=

compress the file, and in so doing lose some of the sonic details.  This ma=
y not be a big deal in music, where the audio is fairly clear to begin with=
.  But with sound sources with a lot of noise (like evps), this can not onl=
y obscure any real sounds, but pixelize non-sounds (like white noise) and m=
ake them start to sound like speech.

                                So mp=

 based on an analysis of the wav file.  But mp3 is not good as a medium for=
 analysis.  It can lead to many false positives and misinterpretations.
