<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Okay, bit of my usual over reation. I took Steve&#x27;s comment as yet 
someone else telling me how the boxes really work. 

 I don&#x27;t &quot;run&quot; any sessions with the boxes, or any other method, I 
let whatever comes-come, no prejudging, or biasing by asking 
questions, nor asking for guides, technicians, or Jesus! It is 
exceeingly frustrating that no one will try that approach--just let 
the damn sprits/entities talk and not try to second guess all of it, 
as if any of us are wise enough to ask anything intelligent. I can 
only guess at how much is missed. 

 Just as today, one of our litle dogs, Winston, aka Littlebit lifted 
his leg on an end table, and just at that second &quot;Littlebit&quot; came 
from the tape I was listening to from last night&#x27;s testing. Y&#x27;all are 
so busy getting the &quot;Evidence&quot;, and doing talk shows, appearances, 
and trying second guess spirit that you miss the truely interesting 
aspects of this work!
