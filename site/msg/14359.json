The labels you  give can influence the \nlisteners: when you have a sound that could be several  things, and you note \nthat it sounded like &quot;keep it moving&quot;, the listener can  find it nearly \nimpossible to try NOT to hear what you heard, and so not be  able to give a \nfresh perspecive to help your research methods. \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ \n(mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) ,  &quot;James W.

There is no way for me to te=\r\nll for certain as it is just too feint. I \n  can&#39;t make out any clear words=\r\n. Sure-I could probably matrix some in, but that \n  is all it would be. For=\r\n an EVP to be considered proof positive of spirit \n  communication by the c=\r\nommunity at large, it has to be clear enough that many \n  people hear the s=\r\name thing, without hints or coaxing. If you have to have high \n  quality de=\r\nvices to make it out, it just isn&#39;t good enough. That does not mean \n  it i=\r\nsn&#39;t a true EVP, just that it isn&#39;t good enough to stand as evidence. As \n =\r\n for the whistle, it sounded like feedback to me as well, but I will have t=\r\no \n  take you word for it that you were no where near any other electronics=\r\n or \n  EMF&#39;s that could contribute to feedback. Even so, if I am trying to =\r\nremain \n  unbiased and objective, there is no way for me to say this is a s=\r\npirit, \n  without personally being with you when you caught it. The only th=\r\ning I can \n  still say about it is could be, but for me it is non conclusiv=\r\ne. If someone \n  does not hear what you are hearing, try to remain objectiv=\r\ne and just \n  understand that it isn&#39;t personal. You have to understand tha=\r\nt with just these \n  recordings alone, there is no way to scientifically pr=\r\nove what you have \n  recorded is spirit communication. If you could get con=\r\nsistent, intelligent \n  question and answer recordings, then you would be a=\r\nlot closer. Here again, we \n  are back to the &quot;So what?&quot; thing. You don&#39;t H=\r\nAVE to prove anything \n  scientifically, unless you want others to complete=\r\nly believe in your evidence. \n  The theory that is being kicked around is t=\r\nhat some EVP&#39;s are personal, and \n  only meant for the person recording the=\r\nm to hear.

I said 16 (my earlier age I was \n =\r\n saying in recorder) and the male evp said 13....then a female laughs. All =\r\nthis \n  was missed by the DR60 (except my 16 was recorded in both recorders=\r\n) BUT then \n  the DR60 &quot;caught&quot; the B7 &quot;napping&quot; at near the end of the 5 s=\r\necond clip....the \n  DR60 heard &quot;let me out&quot; in a clear (quite) males voice=\r\n. So this is very \n  promising piece of evidence for me. **those 2 recordin=\r\ngs have been uploaded to \n  my folder. I will include an Olympus W-10 (soon=\r\n as arrives), Panasonic \n  RR-US360 (when I think to grab it) and my RR-QR8=\r\n0 to go with my RR-QR100, and \n  one more (can&#39;t remember what brand-model =\r\nof this last---due to arrive) LOL. I \n  need to build a multiple mounting d=\r\nevise to aid in putting these into tandem \n  service.
