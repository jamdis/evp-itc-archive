<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce,

Is it common to receive a response comprised of a mixture of men and 
women sound bytes/voices (like I heard in this one)?  My guess is 
that we hear predominantly male voices because they&#x27;re more male 
radio announcers.  Therefore, does the entity who announces herself 
to you as Lisa come through with a male voice at times (because those 
are the voices that she gets most of the time to formulate a 
response)?  Please tell me if my reasoning here is way off base...

Thanks,
Sharon
