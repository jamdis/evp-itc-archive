I consider myself to be a paranormal skeptic, but I\nhave heard some very interesting EVP evidence and would like to look\ninto it further.  I joined this group because I am interested in\nsubmitting EVP data to some rigorous scientific analysis.  I&#39;m an\nelectrical engineer and mainly work in the areas of signal processing\nand communications so all of this is extremely interesting.  \n\nI am interested in collecting some of my own data (at some point) by\nbuilding a ghost box based on Frank Sumption&#39;s designs.  I am working\nfrom the &quot;Ghost Box Notebook&quot; from 2007, but I am having a hard time\ngetting started.  Has anyone built one of these and are there any\nparts lists or more complete schematics floating around? I would\nappreciate any build help or advice any of you might have.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnna"}
