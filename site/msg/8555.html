<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Margret,

very cool; if you hadn&#x27;t written that it&#x27;s a compilation of several
single short sessions, one could really get the impression of a
continuing live conversation. :)

Again I had to laugh about their sense of humor when they mentioned the
&#x27;purple deer&#x27;, and that it was repeated clearly shows that it was not
only a product of chance.

Is the name of Tom&#x27;s cat correct? Did you send the recording to him?

However, what makes me wonder, and what I didn&#x27;t expect is that certain
spirits do apparently communicate only over certain methods - in your
case &#x27;Arthur&#x27; over EVPmaker, and &#x27;David&#x27; and your tech team over the
manual sweep method. Any possible explanation for this? Perhaps those on
the &#x27;other side&#x27; aren&#x27;t &#x27;allround techs&#x27; but only &#x27;specialists&#x27; for
certain methods?

Stefan

&gt; I&#x27;m not sure how to post this one.  You&#x27;ll probably have to follow the text below in order to 
&gt; better understand the content.  This is in the SJ Allophones folder under Margaret Downey, 
&gt; and the clip is titled ConvoWIthArthur.mp3  (link at the end of the post - I think if you cut 
&gt; and paste, to open the file in another window,  you&#x27;ll be able to follow the text written 
&gt; here)

&gt; I ran a bunch of short sessions tonight (about 20 seconds each) asking a question, 
&gt; listening for the answer, then going onto the next based on what I heard previously. Most 
&gt; of these answers came very quickly. I have removed all of the non-relevant sound between 
&gt; Q&amp;A, but very little has been modified in the answering phrase itself (just made them so it 
&gt; didn&#x27;t sound like a stutter.)  Parts 4, 5, 6, and 7 were from a single session, because I was 
&gt; hearing the answer real-time, but not understanding it.  I thought Arthur was trying to tell 
&gt; me specifically what kid of pet.  Likewise, the last 2 parts were together in one session.

&gt; I have lowered my voice to hopefully make the responses more clear. I&#x27;m working to 
&gt; establish whether or not there is any indication of probable intentional communication 
&gt; taking place. So far, I&#x27;d say there are very strong indicators.  

&gt; Can you say A.B.C.?
&gt; &quot;A.B.C.D.E.&quot;  (this answer is sort of buried in the main sound)

&gt; How about Tom Butler?
&gt; &quot;Tom Butler.&quot;

&gt; Do you know the name of either of Tom Butler&#x27;s cats?
&gt; &quot;(Sh)asta&#x27;s their cat.&quot; (the &quot;Sh&quot; sound is weak or missing)

&gt; Do you have any pets?
&gt; &quot;I have a pet.&quot;

&gt; I heard you say I have a...?
&gt; &quot;Pet.&quot;

&gt; You have a what?
&gt; &quot;Pet.&quot;

&gt; What kind of pet do you have?
&gt; &quot;An animal.&quot; (LOL- ask a silly question, get a silly answer!)

&gt; I understand you have a pet animal, but what is the species?
&gt; &quot;A purple deer.&quot;

&gt; OK, I could have sworn you said you have a purple deer.
&gt; &quot;I told you purple deer.&quot; 

&gt; OK, I&#x27;m gonna close for the evening.  Can you tell me goodbye?
&gt; &quot;I love you.&quot;

&gt; I heard you say I love you.  Love you too.
&gt; &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&gt; The speed for this session was set on 106%, which is a little too fast for listening on 
&gt; playback, but I get good responses with the setting.  I have slowed the tempo on the 
&gt; answers by -18 in order to make them just a little clearer.  :-)
