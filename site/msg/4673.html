<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Robin,

Some eBay sellers buy large quantities of things and sell them for a small 
profit.  It could be he didn&#x27;t know that particular unit was bad. That 
happens sometimes and it&#x27;s unfortunate it happened to you.

How much did you pay for it on eBay?

I bought a GPS engine on eBay for $25 a few years ago and it was DOA. 
The eBay seller sent me a new one, no questions asked, no request for 
return of the bad one, no cost or shipping charges, no nothing from me. 
I defintely gave him positive feedback!

Zack

&gt; Thanks Zak, I understand now.  The seller had an excellent rating so I guess I was just unfortunate.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with Ebay before this incident either.  The repair place said they spent several days trying to clean it to no avail.

&gt;  Sorry to hear about the difficulty, Robin. What was the feedback rating of
&gt;  the seller? I have never had problems with any eBay seller whose feedback
&gt;  was 98% positive or better.
&gt;
&gt;  Water (except for distilled water) contains mineral salts that are
&gt;  electrically conductive. When it dries it leaves behind these salts as
&gt;  residues which are also conductive. You might be able to clean the phone
&gt;  if you get to it fast enough, but sometimes the conductivity of water puts
&gt;  voltages on parts where it doesn&#x27;t belong and ruins them. I&#x27;d guess the
&gt;  phone is a goner.
&gt;  :-(

&gt;  &gt; I apologize up front for this, but it occurred to me some of you
&gt;  &gt; electronics nuts might be able to give me a definitive answer about a
&gt;  &gt; bad purchase I made through Ebay a few months ago.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; My kid desperately wanted this particular phone for his birthday, so
&gt;  &gt; I
&gt;  &gt; bid and &quot;won&quot; it. Described as brand new, box never opened, yada
&gt;  &gt; yada. It arrived in seemingly perfect condition, and it took about a
&gt;  &gt; week for us to get it through our pea brains that it wasn&#x27;t holding a
&gt;  &gt; charge. There was a lot going on around the house, and probably
&gt;  &gt; another
&gt;  &gt; couple of weeks went by before I decided it just needed a new
&gt;  &gt; battery.
&gt;  &gt; So I replaced the battery and got a cute little phone case to boot.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; You might guess that the new battery didn&#x27;t solve the problem. By
&gt;  &gt; this
&gt;  &gt; time I had been in contact with the seller, who seemed genuinely
&gt;  &gt; sympathetic and suggested I send it back to Cingular/ATT since it was
&gt;  &gt; still &quot;on warranty&quot; (yeah, right). Instead, I sent it to an online
&gt;  &gt; cellphone repair company that promised they could repair any kind of
&gt;  &gt; damage for $29.95. Two weeks later they contacted me and said they
&gt;  &gt; were very sorry but the phone had suffered irrepairable water damage,
&gt;  &gt; and they could dispose of it for me and give me a $15. credit towards
&gt;  &gt; merchandise or send it back. I had them send it back, probably just
&gt;  &gt; to
&gt;  &gt; torment myself with the reminder that altogether I wasted close to
&gt;  &gt; $350.!!! I just kept digging the hole deeper and deeper..
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Oh, I did contact Ebay and PayPal, but I had waited too long to file
&gt;  &gt; a
&gt;  &gt; formal complaint with either company because I simply couldn&#x27;t get it
&gt;  &gt; through my head that someone would misrepresent what they were
&gt;  &gt; selling.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; So my question is, IS IT TRUE A WATER-LOGGED CELLPHONE CAN&#x27;T BE
&gt;  &gt; FIXED??
