Ann,

This was a message received in Luxembourg before a conference of INIT=
 members in the mid 1990's. INIT is all but disbanded now. Estrep was a mem=
ber, Raudive was a member of Timestream and Centrale who was facilitated by=
 the "technician". The one who spoke these words. I have the recording but =
I do not have permission from Maggy to post it to a public forum. She and h=
er husband no longer publicly participate in ITC contacts because of the pr=
oblems INIT had that ended up destroying its harmony. Believe what you will=
 about Scientology but do not make the mistake of associating this recordin=
g with that drivel.

It really surprises me how many new and old ITC "resea=
rchers" have not gone through the old data and recordings. The pioneers of =
this "field" took in tens of thousands of messages and recordings through a=
 wide range of media.

Regards,

Frank R.

I dunno, Frank. This all=

interested in the human species meet t=

the project." =93This is the seventh time=

relationship with the Light, ethereal realms of exi=

L. Ron couldn't have written it better in the OT3 mate=

sure sounds like the foundation of a cult, which was what =
I always  
had the feeling that group was heading toward anyway, before the=
y  
fractured. I watched it all transpire from a distance, and of course,  =

the outsiders were only given the merest of clues what was occurring  
for=
 initiated. When I finally did get to see some of the photographic  
"evide=
nce," I found it almost laughable. Wait--no, I actually did
 laugh.

I'm no=
t commenting on the audio by Raudive and other "technicians."   
Some of th=
ose Chosen Ones were getting something (like Sarah Estep),  
but my persona=
l opinion is that the central figures were playing a  
lot of power and hea=
d games.

It may be just me, but statements like =93We, The Seven of the Ra=

 =
 
and  "(In recent) weeks, some of your best were cruelly hit by  
illnesse=
s, diseases, and personal problems in order to keep them away  
from their =
valuable work," make all my alarms start ringing.

HMO, of course, and with=
 all due respect, and just based on what I  
read and heard at the time and=
 since,

Ann
