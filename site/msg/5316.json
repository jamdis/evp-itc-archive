Might have to visit RS. \n\n Frank-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I was in Radio Shack buying a couple batteries today for a couple \nof \n&gt; watches and noticed a radio that supplied AM/FM and Shortwave that \nalso \n&gt; had an internal speaker.  I took a shot and brought it home and \nhacked \n&gt; it in a matter of minutes and was willing to take a chance for the \nsake \n&gt; of research.  Well it worked, it is model #20-125.  I took the 3 \nscrews \n&gt; out minus the antenna screw and opened it up.  I took away the top \n&gt; board and didn&#39;t see much and seen a lower board below it.  No \nscrews, \n&gt; they are held together by clips on the top and bottom of the \nboard.  \n&gt; The bottom board once removed has markings and you will look for \nthe MU \n&gt; on the board.  The ribbon looks like a hardrive ribbon for a \ncomputer.  \n&gt; It has glue covering the wires that you have to move away, i used a \n&gt; straight razor.  Once the wire is clean and able to be approached, \ncut \n&gt; it with the same straight razor. Just the wire marked MU for Mute. \n&gt; Close the unit up and your done. \n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanx,\n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
