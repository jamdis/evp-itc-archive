Hello Ursula and Draiga,

From my experience with all kinds of cameras, I =
say it's best to experiment. On one of my experiments, I went to a purporte=
d haunted alley and took 4 different shots using 4 different cameras from t=
he same angle, taking the photos one after the other within a minute's span=
. The 4 cameras I used were: 1. Moditronics' so-called "Full Spectrum" (whi=
ch I've dubbed "Duo-Spectrum" because it only sees into the near UV and IR =
spectrums, excluding the visible spectrum altogether) and 2. Moditronics "D=
eep IR" which only sees into the IR spectrum, excluding the visible and UV =
spectrums, 3. a "Full Spectrum" camera, which sees all 3 spectrums (i.e., U=
V, visible and IR) and 4. a regular digital point n' shoot consumer camera.=
 The results were interesting. In the pictures I shot with Moditronics' Ful=
l ("Duo") Spectrum camera and "Deep IR" camera, I got a face floating in a =
fire escape from the side of a building adjoining the alley; that face did =
not show up on
 neither the full spectrum camera nor on the point n' shoot =
camera. Interesting indeed. I intend to carry on with more experiments of t=
his type, i.e., shooting the same scene using multiple cameras with differe=
nt capabilities. BTW, as you may already know, the Moditronics camera takes=
 stills as well as video, and it records onto SD cards. 

Ursula, thanks fo=
r your review on the SpecterCam 3, which I'll definitely look into purchasi=
ng. In the past I've purchase accessories from the SpecterCam site and the =
site's owner is definitely very knowledgeable. My philosophy is that we kno=
w so little about this research is that I may as well try it all (if I coul=
d afford it, that is).

Draiga - if you decide to make videos with one of t=
he SpecterCam cameras, and you want sound, be sure you also have a digital =
voice recorder running at the same time as DVR cameras record only images, =
and not sound. Also, about Moditronics' full spectrum and deep IR cameras, =
you'll need an external light source if you film at night since those camer=
as do not see into the visible spectrum and if it's a pitch black or very d=
ark environment, they won't see anyhing without a light source. However, th=
ey're perfect for daytime ghost hunting, which I do as well as night-time i=
nvestigations (I don't believe that ghosts only come out and show themselve=
s at night).

Hope that helps. When I find time, I will post the photos fro=
m my alley experiment.

I am seriously considering it. The other one I'm considering is the Moditro=
