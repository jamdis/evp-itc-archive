This was just an example, but all electronic=\r\n equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From this =\r\ntheory I always felt that EVP were generated within a few inches of the rec=\r\norder.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;We are able to reproduce this affect in=\r\n not only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics and au=\r\ndio as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce called the &quot;audio sp=\r\notlight&quot; by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Frank R.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Mon, 6/8/09, Zack Widup &lt;I&gt;&lt;w9sz.zack@gmail. com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;=\r\n wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px soli=\r\nd&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: Zack Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@gmail. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-I=\r\nTC] New ideas&lt;BR&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Monday, June 8, 2009=\r\n, 1:56 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv100209972&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;F=\r\nascinating!
