<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It would be naive of any of us to be surprised by this attempt to mass
produce. Truthfully, I am surprised that it took as long as it did. My
question would be in regards to a guarantee. Will monies be returned
when this mini-box does not work? Notice I say when and not if. 
One of the biggest controversies surrounding the box, besides the
inability to prove by scientific means that it truly is communication
from other dimensions, is the statement regarding 30 people being able
to use the box effectively.
Everyone wants to balk at this thought. Egos won&#x27;t allow consideration
of a possible truth to that statement. Initially, my own ego had me
believing I was one of the &quot;chosen&quot;. Thankfully I am aware of my ego
and quickly realized that my chances were pretty slim. As time goes
by, I hear about more and more people building their own TTTD,
following Frank&#x27;s schematics. It is almost always quickly followed by
an announcement that the box does no more than pick up neighbors pizza
orders or a child&#x27;s confession of their secret crush through walkie
talkies. Science will not allow them to consider that the problem is
not with the box but, the user. 
In the last quarter of the 1800&#x27;s John Keely developed an induction
resonance motion motor which used &quot;etheric technology&quot;. His theory
being that everything in the universe worked on a vibration level. His
experiments to tap into the etheric involved water and vibrations.
Apparently, he was able to use his machines while his collegues were
not. Because of this, skeptics and pseudoskeptics claim Keely was a
fraud. 
In after death communication from Konstantin Raudive, Raudive says &quot;It
can only work when the vibrations of those present are in complete
harmony and when their aims and intentions are pure.&quot; 
On Contact Fields ( On communication from spirits through ITC that say
ITC depends on contact fields or a pool of life energy composed of the
thoughts and attitudes of all researchers involved (both living and
spirits) in an ITC project): &quot;When everyone&#x27;s thoughts are in harmony,
the contact field is clear. They can see into our world and work with
our equipment. But, if there is dissonance in the form of fears,
doubts, and animosities, the contact field becomes cloudy, and it is
impossible for them to see into our world and work with us. That&#x27;s
when negative spirit groups close to the earth in vibration can break
into existing bridges, with troubling results. Troubled feelings seem
to open the field to troubled spirit worlds as they close down the
field to the finer worlds.&quot;
Resonance is a state of going with the flow. When vibration is
synchronized, less and less energy is required to excite the system.
Pure resonance allows a system, once vibrating, to keep vibrating
indefinitely.
So, communication has been made from the other side that allows for
the idea of &quot;30&quot;. Yet, those who devote a good deal of their lives to
attempting to communicate with the other side, choose to ignore this.
When their devices do not work it because Frank, Christopher, etc are
frauds. 
How will the developers of the K-Mart knock off &quot;mini-box&quot; handle the
demand for money back? I suggest they don&#x27;t spend a dime of their
profit for quite some time. It&#x27;s not going to be pretty.

&gt;  
&gt; I think the people who should know, do know how aware they really are.
&gt;  
&gt; And then you have the guy&#x27;s like rod that are stuck in that taps
mentality
&gt; and the guy has the nerve to tell me to stop watching ghost tv shows !
