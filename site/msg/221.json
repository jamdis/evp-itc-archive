I&#39;ve\nnever heard of using both together and honestly, I wouldn&#39;t know how to!\nPendulums are very useful to doing paranormal research and ghost hunting,\nbut honestly, scrying isn&#39;t something I would personally not want to do to\ndo this! \n\n  If anyone here does scrying and uses a pendulum at the same time to\ncommunicate or researches with the paranormal, I&#39;d be interested to hear how\nyou do this and why you would do this! The email below is long, but it has a\nlot of information that is very useful! It&#39;s worth the reading! Thanks!\nLeah!\n\n  _____  \n\nScrying\n\nScrying is a method of divination and takes on many forms. Information\nreceived varies with the type of scrying one is using to get answers.\nInformation can be objective, message given that are in depending of the\nscryer - or subjective, determined or influenced by the scryer. Scrying can\nalso be viewed as a form of mediumship, messages allegedly coming from\nanother realm. This all goes to the scrying tool used and the interpretation\nof the symbol shown. A dream dictionary is often helpful. \n\nScrying comes from the Old English word descry meaning &quot;to make out dimly&quot;\nor &quot;to reveal.&quot; Adding the prefix/suffix &#39;be&#39; (often &#39;gye&#39; in Germanic\nlanguages), gives us the modern word &#39;describe&#39;. \n\n\nArt of Scrying\n\n\nScrying can be an auto-deepening trance process that progresses in stages\nusing tools such as a crystal ball, or other medium. Initially, the medium\nserves as a focus for the attention, removing unwanted thoughts from the\nmind in the same way as a mantra. Once this is achieved, the scryer begins a\nfree association with the perceived images suggested, for instance in a\ncrystal ball, by the tiny inclusions, web-like faults and/or the cloudy glow\nwithin the ball under low light (i.e. candlelight). \n\nThe technique of deliberately looking for and declaring these initial images\naloud, however trivial or irrelevant they may seem to the conscious mind, is\ndone with the intent of deepening the trance state, wherein the scryer hears\ntheir own disassociated voice affirming what is seen within the concentrated\nstate in a kind of feedback loop. This process culminates in the achievement\nof a final and desired end stage in which visual images and dramatic stories\nseem to be projected within the mind&#39;s eye of the scryer, like an inner\nmovie. This overall process reputedly allows the scryer to &quot;see&quot; relevant\nevents or images within the chosen medium. \n\nScrying has been used for thousands of years by different cultures. Ancient\nEgypt used scrying in their Initiations. This included water scrying, dream\nscrying, oil scrying, and mirror scrying. One legend states that the goddess\nHathor carried a shield that could reflect back all things in their true\nlight. From this shield she allegedly fashioned the first magic mirror to\n&quot;see.&quot; Ancient Greeks and Celts practiced scrying using beryl, crystal,\nblack glass, polished quartz, water, and other transparent or light catching\nbodies. Nostradamus is believed to have employed a small bowl of water as a\nscrying tool into which he gazed and received images of future events.\nAlchemists Edward Kelley and John Dee employed a form of scrying using a\nsmall crystal ball or shewstone - a piece of polished obsidian.\n\n  _____  \n\n\nCloud Scrying\n\n\nCloud Scrying is one of my favorite past-times. The clouds always speak to\nme in scenes of various patterns - sometimes mixed with the colors of the\nsky and the setting sun. \n\nThe fluffy cumulous clouds are best as they gently float along and tell an\nunfolding story if one is to watch them move. These are seen on days when\nthe day is sunny with some cloud formations. Having too few or too many\nclouds is no good for scrying. The best time is when the clouds are thick. \n\nSometimes clouds have layers of colors which seem to accentuate the story\nformations. \n\nWhile flying on an airplane - it is fun to watch the clouds from above as\nthe also unfold many interesting patterns - like celestial art. \n\nYou may hear thoughts in your mind while watching clouds images. These are\nprobably coming from spirit - your own spirit guide - perhaps a Native\nAmerican guide of some kind. \n\nFind a location to relax your mind and watch the clouds. Sometimes the\nclouds just seem to call to you and say, &quot;Look up here.&quot; \n\nWatch the clouds as they drift across the sky. the patterns / scenes are\nmost often very large and easy to see. \n\nThroughout history symbols of political or religious importance have been\nseen in the clouds. In A.D. 312 when Emperor Constantine was marching\nagainst the army of Maxentius at Rome, both he and his entire army saw a\nshining cross of light amid the clouds. \n\nIt was said the cross contained the Greek words &quot;By This Conquer&quot;. Later\nthat night Christ appeared to Constantine in his dreams bearing a cross in\nhis hand ordering Constantine to have a military standard made in the same\nimage. \n\nUnder this standard his outnumbered army was victorious. Down through\nhistory entire military battles have been witnessed in the clouds. \n\n  _____  \n\nCrystal Ball Scrying\n\nCrystal Balls can be used as oracles of divination by those who are\nclairvoyant. Crystal balls come in many sizes - shapes - colors - types of\ncrystal - with varying inclusions which allow the psychic to see things in\ncolor spectrums - (the inclusions produce rainbows as light hits the crystal\nball). It is best to use a clear quartz crystal ball with few inclusions or\nimperfections. Psychics are generally attracted to the crystal ball they\nwill use, based on the frequency of the crystal. As with any crystal - the\nlarger the crystal ball - the stronger the energies. A larger crystal ball\nwill also give a larger area in which the viewer can observe images.\n\n  _____  \n\nSelecting a Crystal Ball\n\nAs with all crystals that come into your life - crystal balls just seem to\n&#39;call to you&#39;. There is something in the frequency of the crystal that you\nchose - or that chooses you - that is needed to enhance your vibration -\nraise it to a higher level - so you can access information more easily.\nRemember that all crystals are energy boosters - and are good for\ncommunication no matter what form they are in. \n\nWhen a psychic chooses a crystal ball - it is no different than choosing a\ncrystal skull - for in truth the shape really doesn&#39;t matter. It is what the\ncrystal does for the psychic that is important. \n\nAfter working with the crystal ball for a while - or just holding it - you\nbegin to share a frequency and feel comfortable. \n\nAfter selecting your crystal ball - take it home and clean it. I use mild\nsoap and water then place the crystal ball in the sunlight and moonlight to\nenergize. \n\n  _____  \n\nMirror scrying is an evolved form of water scrying. When it became possible\nto build mirrors they were regarded as being like water that was fixed into\none place. \n\nThe early mirrors were made of polished copper, brass, marcasite, tin foil\nor mercury behind glass, polished silver and obsidian. All types of mirrors\nmay be used for scrying and the size is not important. \n\nBecause mirrors are linked to the moon mirrors should be backed with silver.\nTry and use a round or oval mirror instead of a square mirror. \n\nFor the frame try and use a mirror that has a silver frame. Old mirrors also\nseem to work better than new mirrors. \n\nMost seers prefer to use a black mirror. Because this is difficult to buy\nyou may have to make one. \n\nJust simply take out the glass and paint it black. You may have to give it a\nfew coats of paint though. When you put it back in the frame make sure the\nglass part is to the front. \n\nThe use of black mirrors may be traced back over the centuries. Alchemists\nEdward Kelley and John Dee used a black mirror of shewstone - a piece of\npolished obsidian. \n\nWhen using the black mirror for scrying you do not want to see your\nreflection. The best is to leave the mirror on a table and look at it from\nan angle. \n\nLook into the depths of the mirror as though you were looking into a bowl of\nwater. At first it may appear grey than colors will come and go. \n\nWith time and practice you will be able to see scryed images like still\nphotographs or moving film images. Spirits may sometimes look at the scryer,\ntalk to the scryer or even touch the scryer. \n\nThe visions may even exist outside the mirror and surround the scryer on all\nsides. \n\n  _____  \n\nMirror Scrying - Other Methods \n\nThis type of Mirror Scrying involves messages received on a mirror ... \n\n*\tafter it is steamed up in an area such as bathroom - these messages\nappear in totality and not no develop as if a script or art design. They may\ncome from the consciousness of the scryer. \n*\tstanding in a dark room with a flashlight a few inches below your\nface and stare into the mirror for a few minutes. You will see your features\nchange then change again. Some believe this reflects who you are in a\nparallel or past life. \n\nRemember - when it comes to reality - it&#39;s all done with mirrors... \n\n  _____  \n\n\nOil Scrying\n\n\nThe history of oil scrying can be traced back to the ancient Babylonians.\nSome of their magic books have survived down through the centuries with\ndetails of the methods they used. \n\nOne of their techniques was called the &quot;Princess of the Thumb&quot;. A scryer\nanointed the forehead and thumbnail of a subject. \n\nThe shiny nail acted as a magic mirror in which the scryer saw spirits.\nAnother version was called the &quot;Princess of the Hand&quot;. \n\nOil was mixed with black soot to make a black paste that was then smeared\nupon the hand. The scryer then used the hand as a mirror to scry future\nevents. \n\nA third type of oil scrying was called the &quot;Princess of the Cup&quot;. Sesame\nseed oil was used to coat the inside of a cup that was rested on its side. \n\nThe cup was used as a concave magic mirror to capture and magnify the light\nof a candle that was fixed on its inner rim. \n\nFrom the Babylonians oil scrying found its way to the Egyptians and Hebrews.\nThe most detailed examples of oil scrying are written in the Greek Magical\nPapyri written in Egypt between 200 B.C. and A.D. 500. \n\nFour kinds of water which is to be mixed with the oil is used for four types\nof divination. \n\nIf you call upon the services of the heavenly Gods then use rainwater. If\nyou invoke the terrestrial Gods then use sea water. If you invoke the Gods\nOsiris or Serapis use riverwater And if you call upon the souls of the dead\nthen use spring water. \n\n  _____  \n\n\nShell Scrying\n\n\nThis is a modern method of scrying and is becoming more popular. Most people\nare familiar with the sound of when a shell is placed over the ear. \n\nShell Scrying is listening to the sounds of the ocean. But in fact it is the\nsounds of blood flowing through the vessels in your ear. \n\nIf however you listen to this sound you will eventually by able to pick up\nfragments of conversation. \n\nAt first you may be able to only make out a few words, but in time you will\ncome to understand whole segments of conversations. \n\nIt is all about frequencies - and your developing ability to tune into those\nsounds and recreate their frequencies into your spoken language. Everything\nis about frequency - as in radio or TV - communication - and your ability -\nand your ability to tune in - or tune up - as the frequency level may be... \n\n  _____  \n\n\nSmoke Scrying\n\n\nSmoke scrying is watching the patterns that develop as smoke rises either\nfrom candles - outdoor campfire - or the like. \n\nAs you watch the smoke - it will create patterns - much like clouds in the\nsky - or ectoplasm in spirit photography. \n\nYou may see people, places, things, letters, numbers, scenes or events.\nOften this is in the eyes of the beholder. \n\nSome images are easy to figure out - while others more need interpretations.\n\n\nAmerican Indians practice a special type of smoke scrying during a sweat\nlodge. Water is poured over hot rocks in a tent to create steam. The steam\nis inhaled by those who sit naked around the rocks. \n\nThe combination of temperature, humidity and elevated levels of carbon\ndioxide produce a state in which visions can arise. This form of scrying may\nbe dangerous and should only be undertaken by experienced people. \n\n  _____  \n\n\nWater Scrying\n\n\nYou will need a large, deep bowl made from glass, brass or silver. It must\nhave a smooth and even rim. \n\nThe best time to scry is at night when it is dark and quite. \n\nSelecting a bowl. You will need to do your own testing to find out which\nbowl works best for you and how much water you should use. Metal bowls\ncontain stronger energy. A ceremonial bowl that connects for you can also be\nused. \n\nSet the water vessel in a dry level space, one in which you can easily\nobserve. \n\nBottled water - or water from a stream is best as it is pure and clear. \n\nThe ancient Greeks believed that nature spirits dwelled in fresh water. \n\nThe water may be stored in a vessel and used again. \n\nWater with great energy is often thought to be collected by the light of a\nfull moon. \n\nTo make your wand use a branch from a bay tree, hazel tree or the laurel.\nThe end of the wand should be covered in dry tree sap or resin. \n\nDip the end of the wand into the water until it becomes wet. Wet the rims of\nthe bowl. By gently drawing the rim of the wand around the bowl it will\ncause it to resonate. \n\nThe action of the resonating basin will cause circular ripples to form in\nthe basin. The water seems to breathe with the sounds. \n\nIt is the harmonics that seem to whisper forth predictions of the future.\nThese are interpreted with the help spirit. \n\nIn ancient Egypt - scrying by looking into a pool of clear water - brought\nvisions of gods and of the future. \n\nYou may also receive visual impressions which Nostradamus likened to that of\na &quot;burning mirror&quot;. \n\nYou can also scry by looking into a natural body of water such as stream or\nlake that is still. Images will form. Moonlight is best for this form of\nscrying. \n\n  _____  \n\n\nWind Scrying\n\n\nMany people hear &#39;whispers in the wind&#39; as the movement of sound carries\nvoices that we sometimes pick up. \n\nAncient Greeks practiced wind scrying in the sacred grove of Dodona, which\nwas dedicated to Zeus. Psellus referred to this technique writing &quot;there is\na mode of predicting by means of the air and the leaves of the trees. \n\nThe method seemed to involve the hanging of striking wands from branches of\nsacred oak tress in a way that they struck resounding brass basins when the\nwind blew. \n\nInterpretations were made of these sounds and that of the wind. \n\nOn a windy listen - sit or stand in a place - where there are few other\nnoise to break the flow of the energies of the tones you will hear. \n\nCasually focus your attention on the wind, blocking out all other thoughts.\nYou may hear someone talking. Telepathically send a message back through the\nmovement of the wind and see what happens and who you are talking to. \n\nYou may be hearing between dimensions - or noise or conversations within our\nrealm. \n\nIn order for you to scry the wind, you must, for a time, become the wind. \n\n  _____  \n\n\nLamp Scrying\n\n\nBoth the Egyptians and Babylonians scryed by means of an oil lamp. The lamp\nitself was in fact a stone shaped as a low open dish with a strip of white\nlinen coiled in the oil that had an end hanging over the end of the dish. \n\nThe Egyptians used clear Oasis oil which was a kind of palm oil. The clearer\nthe oil the better. \n\nThe Egyptians used a lamp that was red in colour which is the color of the\nGod Set. Set is in fact the God of evil. \n\nIt may be advisable for you to use a white lamp. Place your lamp on a table\nand sit on the west side facing east across the lamp. \n\nYou should address your invocation to the Greco Roman God who rules the day\nyou scry on. \n\nSunday : Sol. \n\nMonday : Luna. \n\nTuesday : Mars. \n\nWednesday : Mercury. \n\nThursday : Jupiter. \n\nFriday : Venus. \n\nSaturday : Saturn.\n\nUsing the name of the God of the day you should chant a suitable invocation\ndoing so directly into the flame. This invocation should be chanted in a\nsoft voice and done so several times. \n\nGently focus on the flames of the lamp. You will begin to see moving shadows\noff to the side. \n\nDo not look directly at the shadows or they will vanish. Ask the shadows\nwhat it is you seek. \n\nYou may hear voices or you may see images. \n\n  _____  \n\nCrystal Ball Reading\n\nTo begin a crystal ball reading one should \n\n- place the crystal ball on a stand \n- place it on a table with a solid - usually dark surface \n- hold it in their hands - either in one place or turning it slightly\n- have the person they are reading touch it also\n\nGazing into a clear crystal ball opens the third eye and allows the psychic\nto see images that appear physical - then others that are non-physical. The\npsychic is focusing their mind and seeing beyond &#39;visual eyes.&#39; It is almost\nhypnotic s one is looking within for information. \n\nYour eyes may appear to cross if you gaze too long. In that case - relax and\nstart again. \n\nImages with the crystal ball can be stationary or move around as if viewing\na screen. \n\nThis takes time and practice and the ability to relax the mind. \n\nWhen two people can gaze into the crystal ball at the same time - they usual\nsee different things and get different messages. It is whatever you tune\ninto - like a radio! \n\nThe psychic will tell you what they see as they gaze into the crystal ball.\nRecord - or write down - what they say. Scrying Crystal ball reading is\nlinked to  &lt;http://www.crystalinks.com/scrying.html&gt; Scrying.\n\nScrying is divination of distant or future events based on visions seen in a\nball of rock crystal. Divination based on an analysis of reflections in\nwater, on polished metal, or on precious stones was practiced by early\nhumans, who probably interpreted these phenomena as a vision of the spirit\nworld. Scrying became widespread by the 5th century AD and was condemned by\nthe medieval Christian church as the work of the devil. \n\nCrystal gazing was a popular pastime in the Victorian era, together with\npalmistry and astrology, and it involved elaborate rituals for cleaning the\ncrystal ball and for conducting crystal-gazing sessions, which are said to\nwork best when the Sun is at its northernmost declination. Immediately\nbefore the appearance of a vision (which may be realistic or a mere wispy\nswirl), the globe is said to mist up from within. \n\n  _____  \n\nInterpretations of Images\n\nInterpreting what you see in a crystal ball is like any other form of\ndivination. \n\nColors - symbols - everything you see - has meaning and must be interrupted\nbased on the person involved. \n\nShapes can be recognizable or can be archetypes of something connected to\nthe person you are reading. The larger the image appears in the crystal ball\n- the closer the time line for it to manifest in third dimension - and the\nmore important the information is. Everything seen or heard should be\nrecorded - on paper or by a tape machine. Images my be stationary - or may\nappear to move. They may move around the crystal as if showing a scene. They\nmay look flat - two dimensional - or be holographic. \n\n  _____  \n\n\nEgyptian Dream Scrying\n\n\nEgyptian dream scrying may be traced back thousands of years. The method\nused by the Egyptians was recorded in the Greek magical papyri which were\nwritten between 200 B.C. to 500 A.D. \n\nIn preparing to use the Egyptian dream scrying method you must not speak to\nanyone on the evening you plan to scry. You should remain in silence after\nthe setting of the sun. \n\nDo not consume alcohol on that day or engage in sex. You must refrain from\nconsuming food for up to four hours before the scrying. \n\nAfter having a warm bath you anoint your temples with olive oil. You will\nneed an oil lamp which must not be colored red or bear any inscription. \n\nWrite on a short narrow strip of white linen with ink mixed with myrrh the\nname of the dream God and the purpose for the dream scrying. Twist the linen\nstrip into a wick and insert into the oil of the lamp. \n\nPlace the lamp on a table beside your bed. Using the ink draw the image of\nthe dream God upon your left palm. \n\nYou must decide which God or Goddess you wish to use. Thoth was well used\nwith the Egyptians. \n\nLight your lamp. - Kneel before the lamp. \n\nConcentrating on the image on your left hand recite the following invocation\n: \nThoth I invoke, blessed power of dreams divine,\nAngel of future fates, swift wings are thine,\nGreat source of oracles to human kind,\nWhen stealing soft, and whispering to the mind,\nThrough sleep&#39;s sweet silence and the gloom of night,\nThy power awake the sight,\nTo silent souls the will of heaven relates,\nAnd silently reveals their future fates.\n\nConcentrate on your question. Around your left hand wrap a piece of black\nlinen about four inches wide and about thirty inches long. The black cloth\nis called the &#39;black eye of Isis. &lt;http://www.crystalinks.com/isis.html&gt;  -\nor the Magic of Isis. \n\nBlow out the flame of the lamp. \n\nClear your mind and go to sleep. \n\nHave a tape recorder beside your bed so that when you awaken you may record\nyour dreams while still fresh in your mind. \n\nYou will find that the dream will come to you in a voice that is clear and\npowerful rather than in dream images. Sometimes the messages are in symbols\n- cryptic forms. Take your time in deciphering the messages you have\nreceived. You may want to use a dream dictionary. \n\n  _____  \n\nHOW TO USE A PENDULUM\n\nOnce you select your pendulum you are ready to begin. \n\nSit down and get comfortable. Your mind and body should feel relaxed with no\nstress. \n\nYou can rest your elbow on a table in front of you allow the pendulum to\nswing free - or you can hold your arm in a horizontal position again\nallowing your pendulum to swing freely. \n\nYou do not have to be psychic to use a pendulum. It will guide itself. It is\nmoved by either your thoughts or someone in spirit who works through you -\ngenerally your spirit guide. \n\nThe first step is to get the feel of the pendulum and how it will move for\nyou. \n\nPendulums movements: \n\n- straight line - side to side or front and back \n- circles - clockwise or counterclockwise\n- elliptical motion \n\nMost questions asked when using a pendulum have Yes or No answers. You must\ndetermine the direction your pendulum will take for Yes and for No. \n\nHold the pendulum in your hand. With the other hand - touch the point to\nsteady its motion. \n\nKeep your eyes on the point. \n\nNow address the pendulum and say, &quot;Show me &#39;Yes&#39;.&quot; It will soon swing in one\ndirection - which could be side to side, back and forth, or circles. \n\nNow say, &quot;Show me No.&quot; It should swing in the opposite direction. \n\nBe certain the pendulum is not being guided by the movement of your hand or\nfingers. \n\nOnce you have determine the pattern for Yes and No - you are ready to begin.\n\n\nThere are times that the answer is unknown - or the spirit needs more\ninformation. At that time - the pendulum will swing diagonally. \n\nThe faster the movement - the stronger the energies. \n\nSometimes a pendulum will appear to bob or dance up and down. This is\nusually an affirmative response. the point is sometimes called a bobber. \n\nIt the pendulum does not move at all - then you must stop and try again at\nanother time - or find another way to channel. \n\nThere are generally no rituals involve with pendulum use - though some\npeople hold their pendulum in their hand before they begin to &#39;charge&#39; it. \n\nYou can use it anywhere. \n\nWhen you ask your questions you may want to record the answers. \n\nNow you are ready to begin to ask your questions. \n\nStart with something simple such as, &quot;Is it sunny today?&quot; &quot;Is it Monday?&quot;\n&quot;Are you here to answer my questions?&quot; \n\nOnce you get the &#39;swing&#39; of it - you can move on to personal questions. \n\nRemember to only ask a question ONCE. If you want more information - you\nmight want to use a chart. At this time the pendulum should be about two\ninches above the chart - or as is comfortable. \n\nIf the motion of your pendulum increases - or the circles get large - the\nenergy is increasing and you can expect change linked to the question you\nwere asking. Pursue further questions to get additional information. \n\nPendulums can be made of different materials. The best length for the\npendulum is six inches. As long as the bobber - or weight on the end is not\ntoo light - nor too heavy. It should weigh less than have an ounce. The best\nshape for the weight - or point - is something that comes to a point. \n\nYou can make your pendulum or buy one. Pendulums are a simple way to\ncommunicate with the other side. I have seen people in stores use them to\nselect products such as - books - produce - clothing - just about anything. \n\nThe most common types of pendulums are: \n\n- a crystal tied with wire then suspended on a chain or cord \n- a chain necklace with some kind of charm suspended at the bottom\n- a chain with metal pointer at the bottom - these are usual store bought\n- the human body - which is a pendulum that can move back and forth - or\nside to side \n\n  _____  \n\nCHAKRAS - POLARITIES &lt;http://www.crystalinks.com/chakras.html&gt; \n\n- Stand in front of - or directly behind - the person you are working with. \n\nPlace the pendulum directly over their crown chakra [top of head]. It will\neither swing back and forth or side to side - or in circles. \n\nNext place the pendulum in front of the third eye [forehead]. If the chakra\nis balanced the pendulum will swing in the opposite direction of the crown\nchakra - or the circles will be reversed. \n\nContinue with each chakra down the line - throat, solar plexus, spleen, and\nroot. \n\nIf a chakra is balanced the pendulum will continue to reverse polarities \n\nIf it is out of balance the pendulum will swing in the wrong direction - or\nnot at all \n\nYou can also use the pendulum by placing it slowly a few inches away from a\nperson&#39;s body. The point should remain still and move when it locates a\nproblem. \n\n  _____  \n\n\nDOWSING\n\n\nDowsing is the action of a person called the dowser using a rod, stick or\nother device called a dowsing rod, dowsing stick, doodlebug (when used to\nlocate oil) or divining rod to locate such things as underground water,\nhidden metal, buried treasure, oil, lost persons or golf balls, etc. Since\ndowsing is not based upon any known scientific or empirical laws or forces\nof nature, it should be considered a type of divination. \n\nMap dowsers use a dowsing device, usually a pendulum, over maps to locate\noil, minerals, persons, water, etc. However, the prototype of a dowser is\nthe field dowser who walks around an area using a forked stick to locate\nunderground water. When above water, the rod points downward. (Some dowsers\nuse two rods. The rods cross when above water.) Various theories have been\ngiven as to what causes the rods to move: electromagnetic or other subtle\ngeological forces, suggestion from others or from geophysical observations,\nESP and other paranormal explanations, etc. \n\nDowsing and other forms of divination have been around for thousands of\nyears. There are large societies of dowsers in American and Europe and\ndowsers practice their art every day in all parts of the world. There have\neven been scientists in recent years who have offered proof that dowsing\nworks. \n\nThe testimonials of dowsers and those who observe them provide the main\nevidence for dowsing. The evidence is simple: dowsers find what they are\ndowsing for and they do this many times. Scientific thinking includes being\nconstantly vigilant against self-deception and being careful not to rely\nupon insight or intuition in place of rigorous and precise empirical testing\nof theoretical and causal claims. \n\nControlled study of dowsers, has shown that dowsers that dowser believe in\nwhat they do - but much of it is by chance. \n\nDowsing is a searching tool that has been used for thousands of years by\nthose who have tried, with the help of a Y shaped rod, to locate underground\nwater, ore bodies, oil and other important resources. Dowsing is subjective\nby nature. Its success depends on the qualities developed by the dowsers\nthemselves, who sense, via a mind-body link, the presence of underground\nstructures. \n\nScientists have tried to understand the physical basis of dowsing; what\nfactors link the movement of the rod in the dowser&#39;s hand to underground\nstructures. No one has yet successfully explained the dowsing signal and for\nnow it remains by chance - or another psychic tool. \n\n \n\nThanks!\n\n \n\nLeah!\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_005C_01C69D2D.7A8259D0\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=US-ASCII\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Network content --&gt;\n\n\n&lt;body style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;Section1&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Hello All,&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&nbsp; I have taken the time to write some stuff up about\nscrying and pendulums.

Pendulums are very useful to doing paranormal\nresearch and ghost hunting, but honestly, scrying isn&#8217;t something I would\npersonally not want to do to do this! &lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&nbsp; If anyone here does scrying and uses a pendulum at the\nsame time to communicate or researches with the paranormal, I&#8217;d be\ninterested to hear how you do this and why you would do this! The email below\nis long, but it has a lot of information that is very useful! It&#8217;s worth\nthe reading! Thanks! Leah!&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;hr size=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Scrying&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;Scrying\nis a method of divination and takes on many forms. Information received varies\nwith the type of scrying one is using to get answers. Information can be\nobjective, message given that are in depending of the scryer - or subjective,\ndetermined or influenced by the scryer. Scrying can also be viewed as a form of\nmediumship, messages allegedly coming from another realm. This all goes to the\nscrying tool used and the interpretation of the symbol shown. A dream\ndictionary is often helpful. &lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;Scrying\ncomes from the Old English word descry meaning &quot;to make out dimly&quot; or\n&quot;to reveal.&quot; Adding the prefix/suffix &#39;be&#39; (often &#39;gye&#39; in Germanic\nlanguages), gives us the modern word &#39;describe&#39;. &lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;Art of Scrying&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;Scrying\ncan be an auto-deepening trance process that progresses in stages using tools\nsuch as a crystal ball, or other medium. Initially, the medium serves as a\nfocus for the attention, removing unwanted thoughts from the mind in the same\nway as a mantra. Once this is achieved, the scryer begins a free association\nwith the perceived images suggested, for instance in a crystal ball, by the\ntiny inclusions, web-like faults and/or the cloudy glow within the ball under\nlow light (i.e. candlelight). &lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;The\ntechnique of deliberately looking for and declaring these initial images aloud,\nhowever trivial or irrelevant they may seem to the conscious mind, is done with\nthe intent of deepening the trance state, wherein the scryer hears their own\ndisassociated voice affirming what is seen within the concentrated state in a\nkind of feedback loop. This process culminates in the achievement of a final\nand desired end stage in which visual images and dramatic stories seem to be\nprojected within the mind&#39;s eye of the scryer, like an inner movie. This\noverall process reputedly allows the scryer to &quot;see&quot; relevant events\nor images within the chosen medium. &lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;Scrying\nhas been used for thousands of years by different cultures. Ancient &lt;st1&gt;&lt;st1&gt;Egypt&lt;/st1&gt;&lt;/st1&gt; used\nscrying in their Initiations. This included water scrying, dream scrying, oil\nscrying, and mirror scrying. One legend states that the goddess Hathor carried\na shield that could reflect back all things in their true light. From this\nshield she allegedly fashioned the first magic mirror to &quot;see.&quot;\nAncient Greeks and Celts practiced scrying using beryl, crystal, black glass,\npolished quartz, water, and other transparent or light catching bodies.\nNostradamus is believed to have employed a small bowl of water as a scrying\ntool into which he gazed and received images of future events. Alchemists Edward\nKelley and John Dee employed a form of scrying using a small crystal ball or\nshewstone - a piece of polished obsidian.&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;hr size=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;Cloud Scrying&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;Cloud\nScrying is one of my favorite past-times. The clouds always speak to me in\nscenes of various patterns - sometimes mixed with the colors of the sky and the\nsetting sun. &lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;The\nfluffy cumulous clouds are best as they gently float along and tell an\nunfolding story if one is to watch them move. These are seen on days when the\nday is sunny with some cloud formations. Having too few or too many clouds is\nno good for scrying. The best time is when the clouds are thick. &lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;Sometimes\nclouds have layers of colors which seem to accentuate the story formations. &lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;While\nflying on an airplane - it is fun to watch the clouds from above as the also\nunfold many interesting patterns - like celestial art. &lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;You\nmay hear thoughts in your mind while watching clouds images.

In A.D. 312 when Emperor Constantine was marching against the army of\nMaxentius at &lt;st1&gt;&lt;st1&gt;Rome&lt;/st1&gt;&lt;/st1&gt;,\nboth he and his entire army saw a shining cross of light amid the clouds. &lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;It\nwas said the cross contained the Greek words &quot;By This Conquer&quot;.

It is best to\nuse a clear quartz crystal ball with few inclusions or imperfections. Psychics\nare generally attracted to the crystal ball they will use, based on the\nfrequency of the crystal. As with any crystal - the larger the crystal ball -\nthe stronger the energies. A larger crystal ball will also give a larger area\nin which the viewer can observe images.&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;hr size=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Selecting\na Crystal Ball&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;As\nwith all crystals that come into your life - crystal balls just seem to &#39;call\nto you&#39;. There is something in the frequency of the crystal that you chose - or\nthat chooses you - that is needed to enhance your vibration - raise it to a\nhigher level - so you can access information more easily. Remember that all\ncrystals are energy boosters - and are good for communication no matter what\nform they are in. &lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;When\na psychic chooses a crystal ball - it is no different than choosing a crystal\nskull - for in truth the shape really doesn&#39;t matter.
