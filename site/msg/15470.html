Here are 3 pretty clear messages, at least they are to me, you may need to  
turn them up, I use the mono to create them. the first one was when I was 
making  spaghetti, they were telling me the meat was frozen, lol, it was, 
then the other  two are for my daughter, Ayri, one says," I love you," the 
other says," I love  you, Ayri"  I just love these spirits so much, I don't know 
about you  folks, but I see this is a great gift from God, there are not 
enough people out  there that know about this, someone one of you brave souls, 
maybe, Frank S.,  Steve, Shane, Bruce, and the girls, Kristin, Tracy, 
Sharon, Kay, Vicky, what the  heck all you guys and gals, should get together 
with one of the big networks,  CBS maybe, and put a TV show together, do a 
great show  to inform people  out there that this is REAL!    Maybe call it, 
They are  not dead, they are just away
