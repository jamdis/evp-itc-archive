&gt; &gt; Misty, can you please remove Nathan&#x27;s access to this site. I just
&gt; spent the last several minutes deleting these e-mails that have
&gt; nothing to do with our mission and research purposes of this site.

&gt; &gt; Not sure about the rest of the members, but this guy is

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi guys !!!I hope Bruce does not mind me posting this.I had
&gt; &gt; questions whether my RS is working or not,so, I consulted with
&gt; &gt; Bruce.He asked me a few questions on my set up and to send a test
&gt; &gt; session. So, I let the session run on its own and sent him the raw
&gt; &gt; file.Well, sure enough, it is working just fine. I had some static
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; learned to move the radio around to a better spot.But amazingly one
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; the messages was &quot; I want to see Bruce !&quot;You can hear it clear as
&gt; day.
&gt; &gt; Also, I got some vulgar messages and I wonder about this. When
&gt; Debbie
&gt; &gt; did a session with me in the beginning she got some eye opening
&gt; &gt; messages for me. One was &quot;cut the bull ----&quot;. Debbie said that can&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; be !!! but it was right on !!! we were trying to contact my mom and
&gt; &gt; that was one of her favorite sayings here !!! LOLHowever, the
&gt; messages
&gt; &gt; Bruce recovered in my session were a little more vulgar and not
&gt; &gt; something from my mom.I also had events in the house after starting
&gt; &gt; recording sessions.The RS box would go on by itself, not while I was
&gt; &gt; home, and I live alone. This happened several times, the third time
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; came home my computerized clothes dryer locked it&#x27;s control panel,
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; RS was on and my wireless router needed to be reset. I now need help
&gt; &gt; with Audacity or sound booth. I don&#x27;t know how to use it to clean
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; background noise up.Thanks again Bruce (I hope you don&#x27;t mind my
&gt; &gt; posting !!??)Holly
