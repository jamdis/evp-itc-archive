=C2=A0Yeah, been told=
 this. I get the impression there's some joining this group hoping to get t=

 this junk they bail. This stuff is ITC, Instrumental Trans-Communication. =
That can be audio, video, or still images. I think there is a mis-conceptio=
n in the paranormal whatever world that EVP is ghost voice, weak whispery b=
arely audible noise, and ITC is video feedback loop images, an never shall =
the two ever, ever mix. Some seem to think it's all perfectly well defined =
and laid down in laws and protocols. Afterall it's repeated on TV week afte=

=C2=A0
=C2=A0I managed to completely offend the guy that=
 told me about the embedded images, Richard Roberts. He started laying down=
 all these absolute undeniabel laws and definitions of EVP, and when I disa=

went away, sulking in some dark internet corner I guess. I feel bad about o=

=C2=A0Think I'll repl=
