I live in Cary, North Carolina and record when I have the time. There is no set schedule, and when I turn my radio on and someone says hello Michael, or even shouts out &quot;Mike Edwards&quot;, or a spirit tells me I am holding a carving in my hand, who would even know I turned the radio on? Only my wife knows I record, and we have kept this research from our children as well as our neighbors. So you are suggesting that Margaret, lets say who lives where I do not know, is playing a joke on me with a high tech two way radio?\n   \n  \n\nitcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hi Nathan.
