<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My minibox and the RS hack are both yielding messages that come  
through very quickly and need to be slowed about about half. I don&#x27;t  
think I am actually answering your question however, am I? :(

&gt; I believe the faster sweep rate is facilitated by the individual  
&gt; Box and not by our spirit contacts.
&gt; A fast or slow sweep rate is a matter of mechanics in the working  
&gt; structure of the box.
&gt;
&gt; I think if anything our friends are working extra hard to  
&gt; accomidate the sweep of the box and get the communication
&gt; through.
&gt;
&gt; What box are you predominantly using? And if you have more than one  
&gt; are the sweep rates the same?

&gt; This is interesting to me, Bruce. Everything I&#x27;m getting is coming  
&gt; through very fast and seems to come through at the faster sweep  
&gt; rate. I have to slow everything by about half to hear it clearly on  
&gt; playback. Are they pushing stuff through at the higher sweep  
&gt; because it&#x27;s more efficient for them to do it that way? Maybe they  
&gt; have to slow things down to get to anything to us to begin with. It  
&gt; makes sense if they are in a higher vibration than we are. Maybe  
&gt; the faster sweep is more sympathetic to them, albeit harder on us,  
&gt; for two-way communication.
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t think I made any real sense, but there you go...
