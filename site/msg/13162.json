He is just sharing as he goes. Giving the raw \naudio for those who would rather have that than the processed or \ndenoised files. Interesting sounds tho. \n\nMisty\n\n- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rj &lt;rasterer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; On going through them all, I think I see now that you did not post \n12 samples. You posted perhaps four, with 2 or 3 duplicates as \nthey&#39;ve been variously processed. Is this the case? The processing \nto me sounds like audio-cleanup processing, based on the amount of \naudio pixelation it seems to have introduced, some rather severe? \n&gt; \n&gt; However, I didn&#39;t hear anything in any of these other than noise. \nIs there anything particular you wanted to highlight? Were you \nlooking for any input?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sun, 12/28/08, Rj &lt;rasterer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Rj &lt;rasterer@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Audio files from my impact point ITC sessions\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, December 28, 2008, 8:46 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for posting.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think in your original experimental specs, you request five 30 \nsecond audio clips from five-to-ten people. Which would be 25-50 \nclips. Here you&#39;ve posted 12. Will you be posting the others?\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I&#39;d like to hear from the people who created these clips. \nHow did you go about that? Did you do exactly five 30 second clips? \nOr did you do more, and send in just the best?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sun, 12/28/08, M.A. Coletta (Mike) &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: M.A. Coletta (Mike) &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Audio files from my impact point ITC sessions\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, December 28, 2008, 8:23 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;             Audio Files From Crash Impact Point ITC Sessions\n&gt; Feel free to download and analyze yourself\n&gt; Impact Point Diode #1 Raw Audio\n&gt; Impact Point Diode #1 Reduced Noise Audio\n&gt; Impact Point Diode #1 Final Processed Audio\n&gt; Impact Point Diode #3 Raw Audio\n&gt; Impact Point Diode #3 Reduced Noise Audio\n&gt; Impact Point Diode #3 Final Processed Audio\n&gt; Impact Point Transistor #1 Raw Audio\n&gt; Impact Point Transistor #1 Reduced Noise Audio\n&gt; Impact Point Transistor #1 Final Processed Audio\n&gt; Impact Point Raudive Recorder Raw Audio\n&gt; Impact Point Raudive Recorder Reduced Noise Audio\n&gt; Impact Point Raudive Recorder Final Processed Audio\n&gt;"}
