<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello everybody!

First, let me say I am new here, and I really love this group.

I have just started trying to capture images on my TV using a camcorder.  I have had some luck, but my pictures do not look like the guy on the home page here.  Lol.  I think I am not getting the video loop to work, and am just taking a picture of the noise on the screen.  I have tried to manually focus in and out as far as I can go, and I still don&#x27;t seem to have the right focus to create the loop.  Any ideas on how to achieve this loop would be greatly appreciated.  (I have tried to find more info on the web about this and I have yet to come up with an answer.)

Thanks so much!</pre>
