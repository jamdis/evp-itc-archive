2  different things happening-that' s why. When you get  EVP that eve=
ryone

n 
through  subconscious means.
 

 
EVP  that people swear they hear, but =
noone else can make  sense, may be a 
message to them via subconscious  mea=
ns. That isn't to say that ALL EVP's 
like this are  true messages, I am su=

But  then that is how the art of scrying =
starts-matrixing.  Like the 
Rorschach tests. The images you matrix with  t=

insight into your  mind.
 

 
By  gazing in=

you will just be  matrixing faces in the clouds and not getting 
much  subs=
tance. Try it, you will see what I am saying. With  practice, you 
start to=
 see clear, concise  images.
 

 
I  think that is what happening with audi=
o as  well.
 

 
We  already know for a fact pareidolia can occur in audio =
 as well as 
visual stimulus.
