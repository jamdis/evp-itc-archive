After thinking it over and asking \n&gt; myself what the first reason for doing that would be.

I don&#39;t see this so much as an assault on anyone, as it \n&gt; is simply bringing awareness into a forum (ebay) where it is \n&gt; desperately needed. Was it not you who recently stated sellers who \n&gt; take advantage of others in this way are &quot;no more than thieves \n&gt; without guns&quot; and &quot;should not be patronized no matter the \n&gt; circumstances.&quot; You have characterized them as &quot;wolves&quot; and &quot;demons&quot; \n&gt; but now are saying &quot;do nothing.&quot; Which, honestly, I could understand \n&gt; if my suggestion was coming from a place of vengeance. It is \n&gt; not.THIS IS ABOUT EDUCATION FIRST AND FOREMOST, and standing up for \n&gt; those who are, unknowingly, being taken advantage of. The byproduct \n&gt; of providing this education will be allowing consumers to make an \n&gt; informed decision and if that hurts the sales of unscrupulous \n&gt; sellers, then so be it. Ann has just echoed some of my remarks in \n&gt; earlier posts in support of sellers rights to take advantage of the \n&gt; market ... that some people may find it&#39;s worth it to pay more to \n&gt; someone to receive a previously hacked unit. I would venture to \n&gt; guess, this educational information will A) help prevent those who \n&gt; are capable of doing the hack themselves from being duped, and B) \n&gt; force sellers who do offer pre-hacked units to do so for a \n&gt; more &#39;reasonable&#39; fee. This is neither spiteful nor aggressive, and \n&gt; it&#39;s certainly not any kind of vengeance driven on my part. It&#39;s \n&gt; standing up for the uninformed, leveling the playing field for \n&gt; sellers, and it&#39;s bringing more people the knowledge that \n&gt; doing &#39;box&#39; research is not an exclusive club that only the rich can \n&gt; take part in (and given the pricing on the bids for these units, \n&gt; people are under the false assumption that you have a pay a high \n&gt; price to get your hands on a limited resource, when that simply is \n&gt; not the case.)I can see nothing but positive benefits coming from \n&gt; educating people about their options.Margaret--- In EVP-\n&gt; ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Everyone,&gt; &gt; I have been reading the back and forth posts about \n&gt; ideas on how to &gt; deal with the individual selling the hacks on ebay \n&gt; for inflated &gt; prices.&gt; &gt; I posted my thoughts on that individual \n&gt; yesterday. I would now like &gt; to render my opinion as to the subject \n&gt; of what we or anyone can do &gt; about it.&gt; &gt; My suggestion is DO \n&gt; NOTHING! Now before everybody&#39;s jaw hits the &gt; floor, hear me out.&gt; \n&gt; &gt; A couple of months ago I would have been the one to lead the \n&gt; charge &gt; in the assault on this guy in the name of box justice.&gt; &gt; I \n&gt; can now say with confidence, That is not the way to handle it.&gt; Let \n&gt; me explain why I believe this way. Without going into a lot of &gt; \n&gt; detail, I was a tough street kid that grew up on the streets of &gt; \n&gt; Brooklyn, I also served my country proudly for six years as a us \n&gt; army &gt; green beret, then to a career as a FDNY Fireman whose heart \n&gt; and &gt; health where both broken at 911.&gt; &gt; My point is, I have always \n&gt; lived my life believing that anything I &gt; did not agree with or that \n&gt; did not fit my sense of right and wrong&gt; whether it be right or \n&gt; wrong, could be easily solved with aggression &gt; of some kind.&gt; &gt; It \n&gt; took a long while and much sole searching and a lot of &gt; \n&gt; communication interpretation from our friends on the other side.&gt; \n&gt; But I have come to learn that aggressive action in any form is &gt; \n&gt; detrimental to the harmony and peace of the whole involved.&gt; &gt; Guy&#39;s \n&gt; like this guy on ebay do not and can not last in the face of &gt; good \n&gt; and well intentioned people that are here and willing and trying &gt; \n&gt; to get the word of this miraculous research and spirit communication \n&gt; &gt; out to as many people as are in need or want of it.&gt; &gt; That is how \n&gt; we can stop people like this bottom feeder. By spreading &gt; the \n&gt; knowledge of this research from one person to the next. Our &gt; \n&gt; friends have stated time and time again that any negative energy \n&gt; will &gt; be detrimental to the communication and the research, and \n&gt; positive &gt; harmony and vibration will serve to strengthen the bridge \n&gt; between our &gt; worlds.&gt; &gt; So even if you are not religious and do not \n&gt; believe in Jesus Christ &gt; as I do, these words ring true no matter \n&gt; what context they come from&gt; this wisdom was spoken by my lord two \n&gt; thousand years ago.&gt; &gt; &quot;do not check the splinter in your brothers \n&gt; eye, until you have &gt; checked the plank in your own&quot;&gt; &gt; Truthfully, \n&gt; anything we could do to sway this individuals sale of &gt; these boxes \n&gt; would be minimal. Negativity and greed always find a &gt; crack to seep \n&gt; through.&gt; &gt; My suggestion is lets try a little harder to spread the \n&gt; word of the &gt; research and educate individuals that are or may \n&gt; become interested, &gt; through all the various outlets available to us \n&gt; on the web concerning &gt; the paranormal research community. There are \n&gt; endless chat boards, &gt; groups and forums plus websites and word of \n&gt; mouth. &gt; Instead of trying to stop this idiot from defrauding \n&gt; innocent &gt; unknowledgable people. Lets make sure the knowledge is \n&gt; out there for &gt; them and we are here to help them and guy&#39;s like Mr. \n&gt; ebay will &gt; disappear on their own.&gt; &gt; And we will not have expended \n&gt; an ounce of negative energy in the &gt; process.&gt; That&#39;s how I feel, \n&gt; but that&#39;s just me.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Going green?

Without going into a lot of &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; detail, I was a tough street kid that grew up on the streets of &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Brooklyn, I also served my country proudly for six years as a us &lt;BR&gt;&gt; army &gt; green beret, then to a career as a FDNY Fireman whose heart &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and &gt; health where both broken at 911.&gt; &gt; My point is, I have always &lt;BR&gt;&gt; lived my life believing that anything I &gt; did not agree with or that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; did not fit my sense of right and wrong&gt; whether it be right or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; wrong, could be easily solved with aggression &gt; of some kind.&gt; &gt; It &lt;BR&gt;&gt; took a long while and much sole searching and a lot of &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; communication interpretation from our friends on the other side.&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But I have\n come to learn that aggressive action in any form is &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; detrimental to the harmony and peace of the whole involved.&gt; &gt; Guy&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; like this guy on ebay do not and can not last in the face of &gt; good &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and well intentioned people that are here and willing and trying &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to get the word of this miraculous research and spirit communication &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; out to as many people as are in need or want of it.&gt; &gt; That is how &lt;BR&gt;&gt; we can stop people like this bottom feeder. By spreading &gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; knowledge of this research from one person to the next. Our &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; friends have stated time and time again that any negative energy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; will &gt; be detrimental to the communication and the research, and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; positive &gt; harmony and vibration will serve to strengthen the bridge &lt;BR&gt;&gt; between our &gt; worlds.&gt; &gt; So even if you are not religious and do not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; believe in Jesus Christ &gt; as I do, these\n words ring true no matter &lt;BR&gt;&gt; what context they come from&gt; this wisdom was spoken by my lord two &lt;BR&gt;&gt; thousand years ago.&gt; &gt; &quot;do not check the splinter in your brothers &lt;BR&gt;&gt; eye, until you have &gt; checked the plank in your own&quot;&gt; &gt; Truthfully, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; anything we could do to sway this individuals sale of &gt; these boxes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; would be minimal. Negativity and greed always find a &gt; crack to seep &lt;BR&gt;&gt; through.&gt; &gt; My suggestion is lets try a little harder to spread the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; word of the &gt; research and educate individuals that are or may &lt;BR&gt;&gt; become interested, &gt; through all the various outlets available to us &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on the web concerning &gt; the paranormal research community. There are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; endless chat boards, &gt; groups and forums plus websites and word of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mouth. &gt; Instead of trying to stop this idiot from defrauding &lt;BR&gt;&gt; innocent &gt; unknowledgable people. Lets make sure the knowledge is\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; out there for &gt; them and we are here to help them and guy&#39;s like Mr. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ebay will &gt; disappear on their own.&gt; &gt; And we will not have expended &lt;BR&gt;&gt; an ounce of negative energy in the &gt; process.&gt; That&#39;s how I feel, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; but that&#39;s just me.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ____________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Going green?
