Thanks. This is without a box, so if interested parties would like to try =
this just send check to......JUST KIDDING! The point is you don't need anyt=
hing special, the technology just doesn't matter--other than a radio of som=
ekind-- they use what you use! All I do is automate the process. If my phon=
e hadn't died I would have sent a pix of the boom box. It's just a mini boo=
m box cassette/AM/FM radio. Probably cost 20 bucks brand new, a GPX brand, =
"Grand Prix Home and Go music system with stereo cassette recorder and bass=
 boost". I did the session at work, it shows you can do it anywhere. The di=
al isn't even a single turn dial, it takes multiple twists (revolutions) to=
 scan the entire band, or one could wobble between a few stations.

 more along the lines of that type of clarityas apposed to the older boxes =
that generate a lot of white noise. Every day we get a step closer. Bruce

Yeah, it probably just depends o=

ust now went out to Field Elemenary to check a locate request. A locate req=
uest is to notify us that someone is digging somewhere in Littleton, and I =
have to verify that it will not hit any of our burried fiber. This was far =
enough away to not "bother" Field's fiber. Mostly I like to put these up cu=
z it shows you need nothing but simple equipment, just an AM radio, and I u=
sed the built in recorder, so not even recording from the speaker! It's so =
friggin' close to proof, but just can't quite get it there! Frustrates me t=

I was checking out a little boom box here, and decided to=
 do a quickie session using manual sweep of the AM band. This is at work(do=
n't tell the boss!).  The one about the male dog might refer to the mate to=
 this female poodle we have now. For those unfamilar, our daughter in-law k=
nows someone that rescues dogs, and she was tryuing to get rid of some of h=
er too many animals. The daughter in-law at first gave us the male poodle a=
 few weeks ago, but he was deaf, blind, and someone, probably the puppy mil=
l he came from, pulled all his teeth. He was too much to deal with, he fell=
 down our stairs twice, and we felt he was suffereing too much, so we took =
him to the Dumb Friends League. Now we have his mate, but she has most of h=
er teeth, and can hear, see and is a little sweetie. #4 is hopefully accura=
te.   Frank-S
