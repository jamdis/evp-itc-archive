<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Nothing surprises me anymore but I really get dismayed at all the so-called
experts out there, as you describe. Also, do any of these people have a
sense of humor? Posting the duck voice is hilarious!

I certainly ain&#x27;t no expert. I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few recordings that seem to
be real EVP and hundreds of hours of recording with no EVP in them at all.

You&#x27;d think with the availability of the inexpensive RS radios that are
easily hacked even by people with minimal electronics experience, people
would go that route instead of wanting boxes from you.
I for one really have no interest in being in the limelight. I just do what
I do and share it with a few friends.

&gt;   I was on the group My Para, supposedly a social network for paranormal

&gt; the longest history in EVP. So I post that duck voice under most amusing
&gt; EVPs, and apparently got banned from the group for that. I have had enough
&gt; of every friggin&#x27; idiot with a computer trying to be the worlds only
&gt; EVP/Paranormnal expert, thinking they can judge what&#x27;s real evidence. I
&gt; absolutely refuse to make anymore boxes so some egomanic dweeb can set
&gt; themselves up as the big expert.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  This mostly falls on deaf ears, cuz everyone out there is too busy trying
&gt; to be TAPS, and chasing limelights, not ghosts, and certainly not any
&gt; knowledge!
