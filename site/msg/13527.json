She has used it only a few times but the results were encourageing. On her first recorded session, when asking &quot;why are you here&quot;, the reply that she recieved certainly seemed relevant. The Ovilus stated &quot; fell running down stairs, broken neck&quot;. Another interesting response from the recording was in reply to the question &quot;who are you?&quot; The response from the Ovilus was &quot;ghost&quot;. However, she alsorecieved responses that did not seem relevant to the questions she was asking at the time.She sends me all of her recordings for review so I will keep you posted on the results. Personally, I can&#39;t wait to get my hands on one to try it out for myself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Steve\n&gt; http://piedmontparanormalresearch.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: southgeorgiaparanormal &lt;southgeorgiaparanormal@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, March 19, 2009 1:27:03 AM\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] OVILUS\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; hey guys, i&#39;ve been thinking about investing in an &quot;OVILUS&quot;.
