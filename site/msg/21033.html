Oh, they are terrible, lol  "where's Bonnie, she's sleeping,  dreaming," 
"wake her!  "She'll be up all night"  I'll try, "is she up  yet?  "no,"  " I 
tried,"  "almost" "nothing, not even and  earth quake can move her, "  I was 
in my room with the door open, left the  tv on for them today, i don't turn 
them on much, maybe once or twice a week  anymore.  But, one could almost 
write a novel just listening to what they  say.  Had a little conversation 
going by 3 or 4 of them, all because I fell  asleep, what can i say, i was up 
late last night into morning hours, and up  early this morning, so, I don't 
get much sleep.  Heard them yaking away,  clearly, everyone, all kinds of 
talking, about everything you can imagine.   Almost sounds like I have company 
out there, I think they get stronger if they  are on, for awhile. Lots of 
movement out there in the front room right now.  sf
