<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Wow, never knew that the Butlers had supposedly tested your box, along with having no contact with you, and dubbed it or the method nothing. That is an eye opener for me.

The association (ITC) now run by the Butlers used to be named, AA-EVP, I believe, so named by the creator of the group, Sarah Estep but they felt the name should be changed, why, who knows, never thought there was a problem with the original name.

I am glad you posted this bit of information; I see some people in a different light now. I agree with you regarding the money aspect coloring the actions of some &quot;experts&quot; in the field, not everyone of course but enough to be cautious. They aren&#x27;t fooling anyone but themselves in the long run.

I know ther are real scientists out there that would probably study this
stuff if it weren&#x27;t for being ridiculed by the dumb ones. Unfortunate that
there are people that have put themselves in positions of authority, such as
the Bulters, that claim they had a team of &quot;more qualified listeners&quot; test
the boxes and they found nothing to it. Never asking me anything about the
box, or the theory behind it. Always these experts that know better. Some
of these people have $$ interest in keep real knowledge hidden.
