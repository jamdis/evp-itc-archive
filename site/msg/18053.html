Here's a way to look at your specific method.  You  say that David gave y=

the answer.  But, you were not able to hear  it, or would not accept it=

until I told you what it was.  That  would sound like a frustrating situ=

for David, and you.  But,  this experiment could in theory help ther=

Well,  the problem RJ, is all the voices that are coming =
through all the  
time, some of them are from lower levels or plains, they =
are usually  easier 
to hear, because they are closer, unless of course the=
y happen  to be tech's 
or our guides and angels.  The spirit's with  the m=
ost credibility are 
going to be harder to hear, since  they are well beyon=
d the white light, and are 
in much higher  plains.  They read our minds, a=
s they can read the minds of 
each  other, only the ones in lower plains ar=
e not able to read the minds 
of  those higher spirits if they choose to no=
t reveal themselves.   Because 
of this it's going to be tough, if I gave e=
veryone's opinion  out of the 4 
minutes, you could write a book, then when=
 I found Dave's  voice, he was not 
so easy to hear, I had to make it loude=
r, when I  tried to reach Him on 
Skype, I couldn't get what He said correc=

His. sf

I think it does matter though. 

One of  the things we're trying to do is s=
et up an objective framework  for 
experimenting with some of these aspects=
.  I think we  have all experienced 
the difficulty in hearing what is on s=
ome  of these recordings: sometimes 
we're not sure at first what it  says.=
 Sometimes we ask others for their 
input.  Sometimes  we only hear it once=
 someone else tells us it first.   
Sometimes we hear it wrong.  Sometimes =
we hear it right.  And so on.

It would be useful to know, as an  individua=
l, how good we are at hearing 
it right, so we have  some idea how trustwor=
thy our skill, or methods, or  
technology, is.  If we can measure that, or=
 even get a  feel for it, we can 
look for ways to improve it.  If we  can'=
t measure it, then we could be stuck. 
 

So, by  restricting the answers o=
nly to the timeframe of the  experiment, 
we can help filter out some of th=
e problems of  subjectivity: for example, 
one theory is that people can he=
ar  what they want to hear, or can these 
sounds in a certain way,  once yo=
u already know the answer.  Or, given 2 ways to  
hear a sound, being influ=
enced, even subconsciously, to hear  it one way 
over the other.  We want t=
o rule that  out.

This is one reason we can only count on answers  given d=
uring the 
timeframe.  That is when the answer is  most objective.  Once th=
e object has been 
announced, we  move into a  period where we can't discou=
nt possible  influence 
from already knowing the answer.

But, I am  confid=
ent that if a person's method or technology really can  
reveal the correct=
 answer outside the timeframe, then doing it  within the 
timeframe should =
be just as easy, and would then be  a valid objective result 
for all to se=
e.

Snowfire, I do have more  than one monitor.  Some are in my closet  (so no=

in this room, and not near me).   And the others in this room are laptop=

 None of the laptops had anything on them.   And the monitors in the c=

But now that I've sent  out a p=

Th=
anks again for everyone who  participated! I admire your courage and  
moti=
vation to try different methods, see what  works, and try to improve 
every=
one's  understanding of EVP-ITC.

If you recall,  on 7/10/2010 I placed an =
object on top of my  computer 
monitor, right in front of me, and left  it =
there until today, 7/14/2010, noon 
Denver  time. The experiment was for pa=
rticipants to  determine what it was. 
Vague or partial answers  wouldn't b=
e counted (for example, just colors,  
shapes, sizes, what it's made of, et=
c): we're  looking for what it is. 
Participants could use  their ghost box=
es, EVP recorders, or I suppose  any other 
means they chose.

In order to =
 keep me honest, I took a picture of the object  at the start 
of the exper=
iment and loaded it to  the Files section (RJ folder) of this 
group. If  y=
ou can follow the link, it is here:

_http://tech.  groups.yahoo. com/group=
/ EVP-ITC/files/  RJ/RJ.20100710. 
1.zip_ (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/gro=
up/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip) 

The idea was  that you could downl=
oad the file at the  beginning of the 
test, and 'keep it safe' on  your co=
mputer. Then at the end of the test, I  
would release the password so you =
could reveal  the contents of the file. That 
way, you were in  control of =
the original image during the entire  test, not 
me. 

The password for tha=
t file  is: 123BlastOff
Instructions, if you need  them, are also in that R=
J folder.

And if  you did not care to download the zip file before  the te=
st, I will 
post the final image there  too.

So to the results:

Number of=
  participants: 5
Total tries: 8
Ambiguous  answers: 0
Correct answers: 0

=
Object:  A radio
Uzipped picture:
_http://tech.  groups.yahoo. com/group/ E=
VP-ITC/files/  RJ/RJ.20100710. 
1.JPG_ (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/=
EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG) 

So what do the  results mean? All tha=
t we can really agree on  from this 
experiment is that no participant,  wi=
th whatever theories or methods or 
technology  they used, was able to corr=
ectly determine the  object. We can't say 
those theories or methods  or te=
chnologies never work. Just as we can't say  
they do. Just that, for whate=
ver reason, they  did not work this time. 
Readers can take the  results, u=
se them to improve or change their  methods, or 
keep doing what they're  d=
oing.

If anyone has any observations,  comments, or ideas for improvement,=
 let me 
know.  I hope to get a new experiment up and running  soon. Since =
there 
wasn't much participation  Mon-Wed, I think the next experiment will=
 be  
arranged to mostly span the  weekends.

Again, thanks to everyone who=
  participated in this first  experiment.

  they used, was able to correctly determine the

       object. We can't say those theories or methods

            or technologies never work. Just as we can't say 
             =

                                I hope to get a new experiment up and run=

                                soon. Since there wasn't much partici=
