It seems kirlian photography captures certain\ntypes of energy on film. In the demonstration a picture of a house was\nshown. Later that same house had a fire and part of the house had been\nburned to the ground but the photo taken with kirlian photography\nlater showed that part of the house still there.\n\nI&#39;m no expert but maybe energy we can&#39;t see leaves an imprint in the\nnon physical universe and can be viewed or demonstrated using the\nright instruments and technique. Of course I really have no clue and\nam fascinated by the evp and itc phenomena.\n\nEnjoyed visiting your site, thanks for the link.\n\nRichard\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Chad&quot; &lt;cawiggins78@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Richard, and welcome to the group. I am not on here much as I\n&gt; usually just read the posts and contribute when I can. I am very busy\n&gt; with my group so balancing my time isn&#39;t easy.\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess as of now it is hard to say whether or not an EVP is from a\n&gt; &quot;living&quot; entity or just a sound bit floating in time. All we can do is\n&gt; speculate on such matters, really. I think that time may lead to\n&gt; finite answers to our questions, but as it stands with our limited\n&gt; equipment and devices we use to measure phenomenon, we cannot say 100%\n&gt; for certain. I have my theories, as does everyone.\n&gt; \n&gt; That being said, my personal belief is that EVP and ITC can be both.\n&gt; Though my research has been much more focused on EVP and recently, on\n&gt; the Radio Shack hack box, I have seen what I believe to be evidence of\n&gt; both. I have many EVPs recorded that seem to suggest both &quot;living&quot;\n&gt; entities and those that suggest residual phenomenon, or &quot;residue&quot; of\n&gt; things in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; One example is the EVP I captured at the Camp Creek Trustle in\n&gt; McDonough, GA. In the EVP, the voice picked up seems to suggest that\n&gt; he is not dead. Tou can check this file out in my folder here. Also,\n&gt; at the investigation of the trustle, EVPs were picked up seeming to\n&gt; answer questions. For example, when I asked what kind of music was\n&gt; enjoyed by the entity, I received &quot;orcha&quot; as an response. I took this\n&gt; to be an attempt to say &quot;orchestra,&quot; a popular music choice from the\n&gt; early 1900&#39;s when so many lives were lost at this spot. As for the\n&gt; Radio Shack hack, just last night I was again at the trustle\n&gt; conducting a hack box session. When we asked about which of us were in\n&gt; attendance, the answer came back very clearly with two of our names,\n&gt; &quot;Nate&quot; and &quot;Chad.&quot; These were very clear and in an area where radio\n&gt; reception is not that great.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps one of our more compelling EVPs as they relate to whether or\n&gt; not these are &quot;living&quot; entities we are communicating with is one that\n&gt; we recorded in the White House located in McDonough, GA. A team member\n&gt; was talking about someone and how poorly they kept up their yard when\n&gt; we picked up a very clear voice saying &quot;You are so mean.&quot; On the same\n&gt; investigation we captured a voice talking about Kurt, another\n&gt; investigator and how he was stupid.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now to the other side of the coin. We have picked up &quot;EVPs&quot; of things\n&gt; such as gunshots and cannon fire at civil war battlefields we have\n&gt; visited. These appear at first to be residual sounds, yet other\n&gt; aspects of the investigation seem to provide proof of intelligent\n&gt; entities. Perhaps the soldiers who died in that battle are still\n&gt; fighting. We cannot really say based on only the EVPs taken during\n&gt; those investigations. We do have other evidence, but I will not go\n&gt; into that here as this is an EVP/ITC group.\n&gt; \n&gt; Feel free to take a look at our group&#39;s site.\n&gt; www.georgiastateparanormal.com\n&gt; \n&gt; I am happy to send our files to anyone for research purposes if\nrequested.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sure that many of the members of the group will give you their\n&gt; theories as well on this matter, and I&#39;m sure that as you begin to\n&gt; experiment on your own that many fascinating and unexplained events\n&gt; will present themselves to you. Good luck, and again, welcome to the\n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chad\n&gt;"}
