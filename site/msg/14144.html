Yeah good luck on that. I actually researched this subject a couple years b=
ack. At the time there were some softwares that have some capability but li=
ke it was mentioned earlier most have to be trained. Those that dont were w=
ayyyyyyyy out of my pocketbook range and mostly used by big corporations fo=
r things like telephone companies automation systems etc. Even those still =
have problems even with the natural human voice and so not sure how theyd d=
o with voices that people hear differently or disagree as to what was said.=
 I was more interested in voice to text at the time.

Hello Frank 
hobby=
ists like yourself using readily available technology to support a form of =
2 way radio communication - with the "spirit" realm, is a major acheivement=
, and the only shortfall in my opinion (and it is not a technical flaw) is =
the need to filter out the noise aspect.

I would surrgest the output from =
these "stage one devices" needs to become the input for another device whic=
h will filter/capture those wave forms - "tagged" in some manner as being a=
ctual responses, and this I feel can (will) be acheived through some clever=
 computer software development so that communications will eventualy flow t=
hrough a four stage process (4th stage =3D filtering) 
1. human operator
2.=
spirit entity
3.Ghost box
4.filtering software.

I am convinced products su=
ch as voice recognition programs, can be "tweaked" to provide these filteri=
ng capabilitys. so is anyone up for the challenge or knows anyone who could=
 work their magic re: a software guru with a paranormal interest ?;)
all th=
e best,
