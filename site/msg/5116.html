<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Today I attended the funeral and burial of a great lady: Sarah Estep,
the founder of the American Association of Electronic Voice Phenomena.
 Sarah died on January 3, of kidney failure, following a two-week
illness.  She was 81.

Everyone who has ever done EVP for investigations, research or
personal study owes Sarah a huge debt.  She has left behind a
phenomenal legacy: the AA-EVP, an international research organization
she established in 1982; a classification of voices; a library of
thousands of recordings she herself made over the years; and
inspiration and passion that have fueled countless researchers.

I became friends with Sarah several years ago, when I lived a few
miles from her home in Annapolis, Maryland.  She was warm, witty and
wonderful company, and she generously let me listen to many of her EVP
recordings, and even experiment with her original reel-to-reel setup.
 She possessed a great store of knowledge, and a zest for
investigating the unknown, especially the afterlife and survival.

Things come full circle in remarkable ways.  The casket that now
serves as the final resting place of Sarah&#x27;s physical form was also
the beginning of her remarkable study of the afterlife.  As a child,
she once sneaked peeks into caskets at the funeral parlor owned by her
grandparents in Altoona, Pennsylvania.  It seemed obvious to her that
death was an end, final.

Later in life, she undertook EVP experiments to prove to herself that
there is no survival after death.  Night after night she recorded
without results.  Just as she was about to give up, she recorded a
clear female voice that said, &quot;Our world is one of beauty.&quot;  She was a
believer.

One of her most remarkable EVPs was, &quot;Death no more a casket.&quot;

Sarah is now on the Other Side, discovering wonders that we here on
this side only glimpse.  Undoubtedly we will hear much from her 
she&#x27;s quite determined when she sets her mind to a task.

The service for Sarah was lovely, and daughter Becky gave a moving
eulogy.  Three white doves were released at graveside in Annapolis. 
Among those attending were Tom and Lisa Butler, who have led the AAEVP
at its Reno headquarters since 2000, and Richard Shenk, a longtime
AA-EVP member and researcher from Delaware.

Sarah&#x27;s last public appearance was in 2006, at the AA-EVP conference
in Atlanta.  She delivered a marvelous speech on her career in EVP,
and was recognized with a lifetime achievement award.

The AA-EVP is establishing a memorial fund in Sarah&#x27;s name to help
continue research.  Contributions may be made to the AAEVP, PO Box
1311, Reno, NV 89507.

2004), is posted on my website at
