&gt; Okay, well, I am going to put my bid in on this prize. This is the first  
&gt; time I have ever tried to do an experiment like this, so I have no clue as to 
&gt;  if I am even close or not. I came up with &quot;a rock&quot;. I will make a folder 
&gt; in my  name and post it so, if by chance it is right, you can listen to it 
&gt; ahead of  time.
&gt; 
&gt; This is really interesting, even if I came up totally  wrong.

&gt; &gt; RJ, I did not ask spirit for evidence,  they have nothing to prove to me, 
&gt; &gt; because it is as i said before,  this is subject to the listener for the 
&gt; most 
&gt; &gt; part. They are real  people over there just like here, and for this type 
&gt; of 
&gt; &gt; communication  to be coming out now was a part of God&#x27;s plan. Except it 
&gt; &gt; not. The  Wright Brother&#x27;s were laughed at too, people thought flying was 
&gt; &gt; nuts!  Yet here we are today flying all over the place, lol everything 
&gt; &gt;  material in existence today was once first in the realm of spirit or a 
&gt; thought  
&gt; &gt; like state, I believe Jung called the prototypes of everything,  
&gt; Archtypes, 
&gt; &gt; Some might think of the Archtype for the person a guardian  angel of each 
&gt; &gt; spirit.sf

&gt; &gt; Three days left  on this first experiment.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For those who say skeptical people  won&#x27;t listen to any evidence, here is 
&gt; a 
&gt; &gt; great way to provide some  publicly and prove or disprove that statement.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And if your&#x27;re  just the type who maintains an open mind, and would like 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; try to  see what works and what doesn&#x27;t, here&#x27;s an opportunity to 
&gt; &gt; participate  in a multi-person test.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have placed a little something on top of my computer monitor,  right 
&gt; in 
&gt; &gt; front of me. It is now 7/10/2010. I will leave it there 4  days, and 
&gt; remove 
&gt; &gt; it Noon Denver time, on Wednesday,  7/14/2010.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; All you have to do is ask your  boxes/spirits/aliens/etc, what it is.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have taken  a picture of it, and posted it to the files section here, 
&gt; &gt; so there is  no way I can squirm out of the results:

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Please do not try to open the file before noon  Wednesday. But feel 
&gt; free 
&gt; &gt; to download it to your computer beforehand,  so you can be sure I won&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt; change it during, or after, the  test.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Answers anyone reveals after noon Wednesday  don&#x27;t count. Partial 
&gt; answers 
&gt; &gt; (like just the color, or shape, or some  emotion vibe) don&#x27;t count. Just 
&gt; &gt; tell me what it is.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; Best of Luck. I hope for this to be a regularly occurring  experiment, 
&gt; &gt; and I hope we all can learn from the results.
