<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>As far as I know, Chris was asked to take the box and was told that
&quot;they&quot; wanted him to have it. I don&#x27;t think &quot;they&quot; said to have him
take it on loan like a library book.

And just so I understand correctly... Everyone but Chris is allowed to
state his opinions. Is that right?

&gt; &gt; I for one appreciate the openness and the willingness of this group of
&gt; &gt; people to open up the technology to anyone and everyone willing to
put in
&gt; &gt; the time and effort that is so blatantly needed.  I don&#x27;t know
Chris Moon
&gt; &gt; but I have heard him on C2C and have read his opinions.  I am
always weary
&gt; &gt; of anyone claiming to be one of a &quot;chosen few&quot; and using fear to
further
&gt; &gt; their arguments.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The fear-based reasoning&#x27;s and omni-potent subterfuge employed by
Mr. Moon
&gt; &gt; only tells me to ignore him and anyone else like him.  There is no
manual or
&gt; &gt; class  this research is done by Joe-Schmo in his basement and
therefore
&gt; &gt; open to many different interpretations and methodologies.  Take
the good 
&gt; &gt; delete the bad.  I believe in Karma  even if she is only my dog
digging in
&gt; &gt; my garden :-)

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi All;
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  First, the thing, the equiment I make, and experiment with as a
device for
&gt; &gt; ITC, Instrumental Trans-Communication, also now know as Franks&#x27;
Box, or the
&gt; &gt; Ghost box (that&#x27;s also an audio devioce,a nd photography device)
was never
&gt; &gt; described by me, it&#x27;s inverntor, as the &quot;Telephone to the Dead&quot;,
that label
&gt; &gt; was put on my equipment, loaned to Moon for testing, he was the
first to
&gt; &gt; want to test the box, he is not, and was not designated by me as the
&gt; &gt; &quot;primary tester&quot;.  In fact he has yet to pay anything for the
boxes he has,
&gt; &gt; or any of the other equipment he &quot;barrowed&quot;, such as the Sony
pocket size
&gt; &gt; cassette recorder, and Tarot CD, he still has. Moon is the one
that claims
&gt; &gt; only he, or a designated trainee can properly interpret the output
of the
&gt; &gt; box, despite the fact that I have stated numerous times that I
made the box
&gt; &gt; for anyone to use, and one&#x27;s results are any no better or supercede in
&gt; &gt; anyway the results of anyone else. 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  Now when someone claims that these new system don&#x27;t work, or only
get the
&gt; &gt; evil spirits, and even open portals so demons, or what not can
enter, they
&gt; &gt; are lying, and attempting to keep the use of any equipment,  and
methods of
&gt; &gt; spirit communication for themselves. The motive being priofit,a s
far as I
&gt; &gt; can tell. The portal thing is Hollywood! I use my equimpemt in my
basement,.
&gt; &gt; and have sinece 2000, amnd have never expereinced anything I could
call evil
&gt; &gt; beside soem cussing, nakme calling voices, which is hardly threatening
&gt; &gt; except to maybe 13 year old girl. 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  I must point put, because of preivisou threats, that slander is
stating
&gt; &gt; something in public about a person that is knowingly untrue. So
for anyone
&gt; &gt; comptemplating such threats I can say only-- Bring It, I will have
&gt; &gt; everything you own!

Hi Frank, Perhaps you can talk to an attorney to sue Chris for using
his &#x27;Borrowed&quot; &amp; on &quot;Loan&quot; Frank&#x27;s Box (&amp; Tarot CD) of YOURS (you own
it still) and refuses to return it to you (once you send him a letter
to return YOUR property back &amp; to stop spreading lies about it to the
Public)????  Put him &quot;out of business&quot; in making money/profits from
YOUR box! This seem unethical in what he&#x27;s now doing, don&#x27;t ya think?
  My 2c worth.  Makes me annoyed!  =Judy=                           .
