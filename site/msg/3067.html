I started the research with a box i was lucky to have made based off 
of Frank's idea. As all on this board one way or another would have 
done anything to get their hands on one of Frank's boxes or 
something equivalent. So, now it's your chance to get another 
version of an already great idea and everyone's complaining. Isn't 
this the answer to everyone's problem, it may be pricey but i know 
people who would have paid more in the past for a similar item. 
This board is for research, this is just another idea just like 
Joe's idea of joe's box and frank's "frank's box". If this version 
doesn't work, than the idea will kill itself. But, now people can 
get to see if they are truly meant to work with the other side or 
one of the 30 or 80 or whatever the number is up to now. I think if 
you don't like this minibox than don't buy it, but isn't anybody 
curious to see the results people get with it or don't. Just my 
take on it, i think it's crazy that everyone is getting so upset 
about another form of communication. It took me back at first 
because i felt this would kill my research, but we don't know if 
this even works yet. These things happen for a reason by stuff out 
of our control. All we can do is sit back and watch, and who didn't 
think someone was going to mass produce this idea eventually 
anyway?
