I think \nthat this is more the byproduct of being lucky and not the norm as many \npeople report that a good warmup period is required. Although I have \nbeen lucky, I know that people often report that the boxes don&#39;t \nnecessrily hit the ground running. \n\nthanks\nAndy\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;wgungfu&quot; &lt;wgungfu3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone have any process they follow for breaking in a new box? \n&gt; Specific ways of opening communications, specific questions, lengths\n&gt; of sessions when first starting it out, etc.?  Might be good for\n&gt; people to share for everyone else here and fits in with the idea of\n&gt; the FAQ proposed earlier today.\n&gt; \n&gt; I fired it up my goldBox for about 5 minutes just to try it out.
