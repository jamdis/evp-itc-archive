My psychology teacher jokingly told me that you could tell a crazy person b=
y the way they think everyone else is crazy. I think there may be some vali=
dity to that.

I think this was a case of a pot calling the kettle black.

    Art Bell was filling in, and he ha=

Spiricom, implying they also did not work. Not only that, it was implied th=

are the last word on anything paranormal, turning into more of debunking ag=

being carefully guided and manipulated. Radio remains only good for a sourc=
e of raw audio, and not any meaningful information or dialog. 

  These "re=
searchers"/debunkers never check any facts, never check with anyone that ma=
kes or uses the equipment, they just pass their opinions off as facts. If t=
hey actuyally honelstly tested this technology they would be singing a diff=
