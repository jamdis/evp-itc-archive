There are  \nseveral people saying things, and me at the end repeating what I think I hear  \nthe guy before me saying.   You&#39;ll need to listen at least two times  to \nhear it, because of static, wish i could get my hands on one of those formal  \nboxes, bet I could get some really good stuff, because they don&#39;t seem to \ncarry  so much static. Now, why is that I wonder.  Maybe I can stop the static  \nwith this 20-125 some how. sf\n\r\n--part1_517ca.6895bdea.39328bbc_alt_boundary\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3DUS-ASCII&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Type&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18904&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot; id=3Drole_body =\r\n bottomMargin=3D7 leftMargin=3D7 rightMargin=3D7 topMargin=3D7&gt;&lt;FONT id=3Dr=\r\nole_document  color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Here&#39;s an interes=\r\nting message I received last night, I was asking about \nconfirmation of wha=\r\nt David keeps telling me,,here&#39;s what I got.
