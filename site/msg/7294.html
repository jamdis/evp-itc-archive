Hi Frank,
 
You being honest is all that any of us want from you.  And that is why  you 
get so much respect.

Hard to hear in the cell phone video, but just had time to do a  quickie demo 
before having to run to work. Thought I might as well keep  posting the 
information so it can be ripped off by the ones selling their  stufff, and they can 
say how flawed my stuff is. I really don't mind others  taking the ideas and 
making improvements, changes, and making a profit, but ya  don't have to beat 
me up in the process.  See the current TAPs paramag  for the curious. I heard 
about it through someone that gets the mag, but  don't know anything first 
hand. I don't care that much to spend money to get  magazine. 
Paranormal=HollywooI heard

I am well aware  of the short comings of my equipment, I'm just honest enough 
not to sell it  till it's perfected. I'm not an engineer, just a hillbilly 
techno  droid trying satisfy her own curiousity.  

Frank-S
