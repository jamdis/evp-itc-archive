I was wanting to get feedback and make sure I was working it 
correctly.  

Thank you for your help.  I&#x27;ll definitely experiment with what you 
suggest. :)

&gt; LC,
&gt;  
&gt; This file is a very good file other than the pulsing noise which is 
common with the 469
&gt; the answers and message where loud clear and to the point. my 
suggestion is to take 
&gt; out a small ammount of the hiss, slow the file down about 15% and 
lower the volume a bit.
&gt;  
&gt; Be careful not to do to much as to alter the file itself just tweak 
it a little.
