<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks, I still had alittle work to do on the last one. I put in all 
the volume controls and jacks tonight, then added a meter driver so I 
could tell where the tuning voltage was if I use manual mode. It&#x27;s 
already to test now.

&gt;            I made one today, same as the last except I can adjust 
the sweep level, and where in the band the sweep starts, or do manual 
sweep. I used to put this function in the boxes, but no one used it, 
too busy asking stupid questions, or showing the world what great 
mediums they were cuz they had a box,  so I started leaving it out to 
save parts, and front panel space. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I don&#x27;t think you can force, or coerce spirit, I&#x27;ve always thought 
it best just to allow. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Curious--these are for me a change, and they are flying together. 
Never before have I made a board in 24 hours, it required only a 
slight shift in the concept.
