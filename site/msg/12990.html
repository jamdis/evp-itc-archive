Rejecting spam is absolutely your right. It is also the right of others to post what they choose as long as it is within the guidelines of the groups moderator of which you are not. 

As far as my making the distinction, the headline of the post was clear as to the contents, so therefore, you chose to read it. Now if someone was there holding you against your will until you read it, then I apologize.

Jeremy

Dear Jeremy,
 
The length of membership is not an issue for me. Someone who is a part of this group for a longer length has no more rights than a newbie. I joined EVP-ITC not IPAA.  If I read messages sent from EVP-ITC I expect stuff related to that group ONLY.  If I join IPAA and read messages sent from IPAA then I expect stuff related to that group ONLY as well.
 
If the message is sent by EVP-ITC and I open it and it is about something else entirely under the assumption it was about EVP-ITC, I WAS MADE TO READ IT. I'm sorry you cannot make that distinction.
 
There is a difference between mentioning something off handedly vs. running an entire ad. I do have the right to reject spam.
 
The moderator did reply to me and that was sufficient. Thank you very much.
 
~Clara

The IPAA is run by people who have been members for a long time. It is paranormal related and fine by me. No I'm not a member of IPAA, but they have a right to post if they like as long as it does not break the rules. Nobody is making you read the posts and you don't have to click anything you don't want to.

Who is IPAA and why am I receiving this information with a link for me to click on?
 
I would prefer not to receive these kinds of invitations through this group.  I usually get enough ads as it is without getting them enclosed in messages from groups I belong to. In the past I have received invitations sent directly to my email address and read them when it is convenient for me to take EXTRA time to read them.
 
Please don't make me hesitate to open EVP-ITC messages.
 
Thank you.

Dear Friends,

Welcome to the Official IPAA Nominations site. This is a new venture
and has never been done before on this global level. This site, ANYONE
can join, it is FREE, you can showcase your work, network with others,
create projects with new friends, and of course showcase your sincere
dedicated hard work, promote yourselves, and promote your books,
movies, music, TV shows, radio shows, all your talent in the
Paranormal! Networking and helping others in a haunting or a Mufon
watch, the ideas are endless!

We are working hard to find sponsorships and unfortunately this 1st
annual event, donations are required to help offset the awards. Any
donations at $25.00 or more would be greatly appreciated.

All nominees, will become featured members. The donations are good
till Nov 7, 2009 and that's a wonderful savings and very affordable
for all to participate and enjoy ALL YOUR hard work!

Sending You All the Best from IPAA
