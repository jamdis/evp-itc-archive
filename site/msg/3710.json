Maybe he&#39;ll tell us why himself, if he chooses, since he&#39;s a list member.\n\nCan I ask you what personal experiences you have had with evil entities that make you so concerned? Not other people&#39;s alledged experiences, but your own? I&#39;m really curious.

The page has been changed as of Dec 3rd! Imagine\n&gt;that. The article did indeed state that children and high school\n&gt;students would be part of the testing groups as well as skeptic,\n&gt;believers, etc. \n&gt;Yes I did notice the discrepancy between the asup article and the\n&gt;disclaimers on the paranormal sytems page. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Well, so much for the &quot;Oh Noes!1!!

Do not allow children under the age of 16 to use this device\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 2. Although individual sessions are effective, group sessions are more\n&gt;&gt; &gt; productive.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 3. This is not an &#39;electronic Ouija board&#39; - no harm can come from\n&gt;&gt; &gt; using it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 4. Some voices will use coarse language so be prepared for it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 5. Always use a recorder to tape all sessions\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 6. Keep a notebook with the times and locations of your sessions.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 7. The MiniBox will call you by name so don&#39;t be startled by it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Lance\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
