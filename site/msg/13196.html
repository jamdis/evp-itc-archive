I would try a K-2 to see if it responds, use it with a camcorder, and a voi=
ce recorder.
to record your findings, keep in mind that the land and buildi=
ng was used in the 1700's
so they might not know what you are using, or wha=
t it does, Just tell them what you are 
doing , using , and what it does.=
=A0 this has helped me in the past. I went to an old building it took 5 tim=
es before i got anything. so hoped this helped. good luck
