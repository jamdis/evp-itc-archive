I got this recorder a couple weeks back, but haven't messed with it  much.  
But every time i record, i get an EVP.  This recorder is really  strange, it 
seems like it doesn't have great sound quality for recording  us.  The answers 
are much clearer than the questions.  I know this  isn't box research, but it's 
still communication.  Like i said, i never  settle on one style.  To me, all 
styles work and if you mix it up it will  never get boring as long as we are 
getting results.  Here are just  a few traditional Evp's i thought were pretty 
good and worth sharing, the  thing is that i hardly had to touch these files.  
What you hear is pretty  close to the original files, listen and let me know 
what you guys think.   Has anybody else got good stuff from this panasonic 
recorder, if so i would love  to hear it.
