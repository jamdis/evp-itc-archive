Hi All;
=A0
=A0I tried to listen to the C2C s=
how last night on 2012, but OMG, these supposed experts they get! First, St=
rieber has no concept of how the Mayans could possibly have known anything,=
 since we are supposed to be so much more advanced, and he thinks he is suc=
h a genius, but can't figure it out. The guy is frikkin' idiot! The other "=
expert", Bob Gleason, better, but still, basing everything on current knowl=
edge. So the "information" on 2012 comes down to some crackhead's opinion, =
based on ego and nothing more. 
=A0
=A0No wonder the stuff from the boxes i=
s completely ignored by these people, they have no concept of spirit, or an=
y other entities, and all information has to come from the likes of Striebe=
r, Hoagland, and Howe. God almighty! I am totally disgusted. Noory is suppo=
sedly co-authoring a book on spirit communcation--yeah can't wait for that-=
-the new house has a fireplace!
=A0
=A0I know, I'm ranting, but instead of =
providing a place to share information and insights, they make C2C a place =
to manipulate any facts that may exist, and subtly debunk almost everything=
. I think it's just another corporate mouthpiece. They don't want to the=A0=
 masses seeking out the hidden bunkers supposedly being perpared by the eli=
te few--just a gues as to the why of disinformation. 
=A0
=A0It would be ea=
sy to disregard one culture coming up with the date in 2012, but the whole =
damn world!? I think it might be wise to pay attention. That fact is conven=
iently ignored by these Mayan experts presenting their gospel opinions.
