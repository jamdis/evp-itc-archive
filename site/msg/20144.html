<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The digital sampling rate of the DR60 is only 8KHz, so that is one of the reasons it is muffled and noisy (excluding what the codec contributes in terms of artifacts). The QR200 has much better (higher) sampling rate and therefore does sound crisper, BUT if you put the QR200 on long play mode, it would equate to the DR60 in sound quality and maybe evp reception as well. Worth trying.

&gt; The qr100, i never got anything on.  It sounds nothing like the rr-dr60.  The 100 and 200 look and sound the same, but i&#x27;ve had success with the 200.
&gt; 
&gt; The dr60 is in a class by itself, it&#x27;s so muddy and distorted sounding.  The 100 and 200 are nice and clear sounding.

&gt; &gt; The QR100 and 200 were the only ones that had a codec similar to the earlier DR60. I wouldnt bother therefore with any later Panasonics than the QR200. If you can get a 100, its almost identical, except it has less memory (recording time).

&gt; &gt; &gt; This seems to be the second most sought after recorder for evp&#x27;s, so i found one on ebay.  Much cheaper when the listing doesn&#x27;t say EVP in the title.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; Got this one for a song !  I was just testing it out and i thought i heard something, let me know what you guys hear.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; -Steve
