<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>LOL, I can perfectly well see how you could hear &quot;they don&#x27;t talk&quot; :) That is MUCH nice than what I am hearing :) Thanks. Yes.....with the little girl saying &quot;I want my paaaw&quot; then woman (warble tone) saying &quot;big girl&quot; ....... those words &quot;Big Girl&quot; do stand out well. Is a shame the little girls voice is so difficult. Thanks again Misty :) --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Misty&quot; &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:

&gt; &gt;   File        : /Jim&#x27;s RR-DR60 EVP&#x27;s/train-hey-dumb-fuck-evp.mp3 
&gt; &gt;   Uploaded by : clockdryve &lt;clockdryve@&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   Description : Got this on June 7th at a creek with 2 train trussels and a bridge that pass over it. Kids hang out around the water in summer. Was a misty-rainy day when I recorded. No kids have been out yet.....school just recently out. I hear a train off in distance from another location, I repeat that I hear a train into the recorder. Then a &quot;smart mouthed&quot; young teenager says a cuss word (is in title)
