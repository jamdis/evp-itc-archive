I think raw \naudio generation is the next component to be added... I have a couple \nof switches that I haven&#39;t used yet and some additional open space.\n\nWonder what I&#39;m talking about...?? A quick trip to my blog will show \n& tell.\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com\n\n- Mike\n\n---------------------------\nRadio Shack Hack videos at:\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;April Slaughter&quot; &lt;aprilrebuilt@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; My husband I are proud owners of a MiniBox. The #3 Prototype. It \nwill\n&gt; be fitted with one of Ron&#39;s new boards after the first of the year.\n&gt; While the box is #3, I am nowhere on the beloved list of &#39;30 worthy\n&gt; souls&#39; to use the technology, yet it works just fine for me. \n&gt; \n&gt; How many people on the board have a Mini now? :)\n&gt;"}
