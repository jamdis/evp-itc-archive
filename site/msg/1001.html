Not uncommon in this work Monki. If ya lived close enough I could fix it for ya but not sure where on the east coast you are residing (yes guys I can fix pc's LOL =P but no that doesnt make me the tech type...practice makes perfect). I went thru two computers in a months time, fried everything completely right down to the last chip. Appliances dont last long at my house (near me) and tv's, vcr's, backups units...u name it I have fried it. It finally stopped when I asked them to stop whatever they were doing that was putting so much pressure on my machinery. Now they say Otto is in charge of equipment, and havent had much problems on my end. 
   
  Email weirdness is also common I have watched mine and others emails disappear, then sometimes show up later with changes made in the wording of the message. Retro Dave has bore the brunt of the email problems LOL I just had it happen once when I responded to his postings of having problems. My post disappeared then came back changed/edited. Thats been a long time ago tho. 
   
  After saying all that you should of course check the basics, make sure everything is plugged up properly, see if anything feels extremely hot (if it is shut it down immediately to cool) then ya may wanna pop the lid off the tower of the pc to check inside and remove the sound card, clean the contacts, then replace it to see if that helps. UNPLUG IT FROM ELECTRIC FIRST! If that doesnt help then you may need to replace the part. Keep an eye on temperatures if something is running hot sometimes it will cause the metal to swell/bend/melt/move.
