Ya know they said he was around when I did that session last week but since it was the aunties and they were mad at us for what we said (privately) I ignored them LOL
   
  I think I sent ya some of what they said bout us pissing them off but I thought it was distatsteful of them to bring up frankie being there for the session so I ignored some of what they said.
   
  I'd like to say I will pay more attention to the aunties, but welllllllllll...you know how they can be LOL
