Some things seam different. The first \nthing that struck me was the numbers in the digital read out are \nsmaller and darker. The blue glow is brighter. So the new fancy dancy \nbox looks so much better than my old one so what? But it stuck in the \nback of my mind. After doing the snip-a-roo and fireing up the bad \nfella there was a response within the first 2 min saying the persons \nname that the box was built for. Ok may be power of intent. But when \nswitched over to am that lovely CLICK CLICK CLICK wasnt so annoying. I \ncould actually tolerate lisening to a recording without getting a \nmigraine! And there were actual results from an AM sweep. So have they \ndone mods to this model? The back of the radio has the same numbers on \nit. For anyone interested in the first recording here is the link.\n\nhttp://www.esnips.com/doc/e02a5e4d-7d07-4ffa-ad1d-e09170f8bf25/Geralds-\nbox"}
