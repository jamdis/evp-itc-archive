You can \nfor\n&gt; instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip \n(including\n&gt; the experimenter&#39;s voice), filter or denoise it to make it \nclearer, but\n&gt; not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP \nmatch\n&gt; with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should \nalways\n&gt; be provided along with the edited version.\n&gt; \n&gt; But that&#39;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to \nexpress, as\n&gt; we should always be able to present our results to a critical \npublic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these \nfiles.\n&gt; &gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that \n&gt; &gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the \nmessage \n&gt; &gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise \nthat \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can&#39;t piece \nthese \n&gt; &gt; files together to make something it&#39;s not, so i keep them in \ntrue \n&gt; &gt; form pretty much to the original.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Steve\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hey Steve Forgot to ask...how much editing was needed to get \nthis \n&gt; &gt; file?
