I monitor my audio live. The funny thing is that even so, those last EVP's =
I captured I did not hear either in the environment, or on my recording as =
it happened. I only heard them upon playback.

  I am curious =
if anyone with a microphone wired to a remote site has ever gotten any EVP =
in real time.

  I took part in an investigation of Ashmore Estates, near A=
shmore IL, on Saturday night. We had six video cameras set up in the three =
halls of the building. The video for all was being monitored and recorded a=
t a central location. Alas, we did not have microphones at the camera sites=
 conected to the central location. I wonder what we might have heard if we =
did?
