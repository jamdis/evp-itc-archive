&gt; Hello all, I just signed up to this group this morning. I was talking
&gt; with a friend about EVPs last night, and she mentioned this forum
&gt; which I&#x27;d not heard of before. I&#x27;m really looking forward to reading
&gt; through the posts and seeing/listening to your evidence.
&gt;
&gt; I just took a quick look at some photos, which reminded me of what I&#x27;d
&gt; seen on the Scole Experiment book. Doing a search on the word &quot;Scole&quot;
&gt; in the forum turned up lots of results. I&#x27;m so excited to be in
&gt; contact with people who have actually even HEARD of the Scole
&gt; experiments! It makes me feel like some of the predictions or messages
&gt; received in the Scole communications are coming to fruition [as far as
&gt; that as a world-wide growing awareness of ITC and the possibilities it
&gt; represents].
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m constantly surprised by the opportunities for connections and
&gt; knowledge that turn up during my constant quest for answers.
&gt;
&gt; I hope I can contribute something worthwhile to this forum!
&gt;
