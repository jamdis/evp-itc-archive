<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I can say that having experienced the death of the body twice, I came  
back alone and it was a very positive experience.

For some reason, many focus on the negative, but aside from the Fish,  
my paranormal experiences have been extremely positive.

I tend to see apparitions such as those in Gettysburg (and other  
emotionally charged locations) as residual energy as opposed to  
dealing with an actual or actual entities that are intelligent.

I also feel that the spiritual realms are not too far off from the  
illusion we experience here on this plane - you meet all kinds. Some  
angelic, and some just awful.

&gt; locations or even people who have survived deep personal traumas.
