Good morning Frank,
 
I started my Sunday morning ritual off differently this morning by coming  
downstairs and getting coffer, firing up the laptop and having a smoke in the  
only place my wife will let me smoke in my house.  Boy it sure feels good  this 
morning.  And the first thing I do when I check my mail is check  my mail and 
listen to your file.  I listen to all your files but I do not  always 
respond.  I am always amazed at the communication you receive.
 
I was especially impressed about these files.  They were very clear  and made 
complete sentences.  The second file in the zip just blew me out  of the 
water.  Especially after listening to it over and over again I was  astounded.  I 
especially liked the last word in the second file.  A  lot of us have received 
files with your name in it which is nothing new to any  of us.  But for you 
to receive a file with my name in it.  It is the  last word said in the second 
file following the statements.  I just want to  thank you for putting that out 
there so that I could hear it.other people have  gotten my name before but 
that is only because they have asked direct questions  and my name has come up.  
In your file it was just stated.  And for  that I thank you.
 
Thank you again,
 
Jeff
