I wish i had the older one 12-470 with the built in speaker.  from the video&#39;s i been watching it doesn&#39;t seem to have that annoying click in between each AM channel.\n\nAfter conditioning my ears i can block outthat clicking noise now, but my teammates can&#39;t and get distracted from it."}
