<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was with the understanding that these &#x27;telephone pickup devices&#x27;  
worked on the principle of mutual induction or inductive transfer. 
Their designed use is for being placed onto a telephone handset where 
there is a magnetic induction field which radiates the audio signal 
from the telephone receiver.
That induction field is picked up by the coil inside the &#x27;telephone 
pickup devices&#x27; and the energy (current changes, etc.) is transferred 
down the wire and into a device that can record or play (audio) what 
is being picked up by the &#x27;telephone pickup device&#x27;.

So... it appears to me that this attempted association with Frank&#x27;s 
Box in their ad is a complete false bit of advestising.
The &#x27;Frank&#x27;s Box&#x27; as we all know does not work under this principle.

What the advertised device appears to do, or attempts to do, is 
search for magnetic fields and produces some kind of sound when it 
finds them...???  The association with Frank&#x27;s Box is for advertising 
purposes only I&#x27;m guessing...
A way to sucker in those not knowing this.

&gt; This is basically the &quot;buzz stick&quot; setup from lessemf.com Any 
suction 
&gt; cup type mic pickup and amplified speaker can work in a similar 
fashion 
&gt; as it is basically a single axis emf probe. I suppose according to 
the 
&gt; traditional evp coil induction theory that it could work, but about 
4 
&gt; years ago I did extensive testing with this type of pickup on a 
yamaha 
&gt; 4 track recorder with diodes and microphones on other tracks. The 
only 
&gt; success I had was with the tracks that had a regular microphone 
&gt; attached. As I understand it, this device transforms the em 
frequency 
&gt; to it&#x27;s corresponsing audible frequency, sortof a &quot;reverse mic&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I have never had any success in it&#x27;s use, but it certainly is a 
cheap 
&gt; way to experiment. I don&#x27;t see a connection to a Frank&#x27;s box by 
&gt; functionality, Frank&#x27;s boxes and similar model ghost boxes are much 
&gt; more complex and sophisticated. You can think of the above as an 
&gt; audible emf sensor.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope it helps,
