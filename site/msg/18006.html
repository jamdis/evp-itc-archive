Your points are well taken John.  And I  agree it is a =

For this first experiment/prot=

possible: it doesn't  matter r=

how  different people inte=
rpret it: just determine the object in  the 
specific timeframe.  We'll sta=

get, however they do  i=

As to your comment on the audio files:   originally I considered requir=

as part of the protocol to  include the audio.  Maybe that is still a =
good  
idea.  The reason I didn't, is because people often  claim to hear d=
ifferent 
things each time they listen to a  file.  Posting a file with an =
incorrect 
answer, for  example, the person may later claim (after the expe=

NOW hear the right answer.  And others may confirm  it.

This =
seemed liked a rabbit hole, and I'm not sure  how to handle it. So for 
thi=

va=
lid if they are  given during the experiments specified time frame. Once 
t=

the answer.

But yeah, we need to see how  this goes, fix the problems, an=

more of  them!

Since we're talking about experiments and protocols  here are=
 some ideas to 
improve
the protocol RJ suggested initially. Using a test  =
target is one way of 
establishing a 
truth in time, which is the basis of =
this experiment.  But there are a 
couple of issues.
 
It is quite possible=
 that someone could discern the  target through remote 
viewing alone.
This=
 would negate the need for involvement of a  spirit communicator or 
discar=
nate entity.
Outcomes depend on the word of those reporting.  The true skep=
tic (not 
cynic) would 
therefore say that this experiment contains a basic=
  flaw in that it does 
not uniquely 
indicate that the information was obt=
ained in the  prescribed manner. 
Providing access
to the raw audio file wo=
uld not necessarily  constitute proof either, since 
many of these 
communi=
cations can only be heard by certain people,  

If the audio file were quit=
e clear,  timing  becomes an issue. In other 
words, when  was 
the audio a=
ctually recorded?  This issue can be  mitigated simply by 
requiring any
cl=
aimant to email the audio file to a trusted party  before the test ends. 
I=
t would be best 
if the trusted party were not otherwise involved in  the e=
xperiment and it 
was  their duty 
simply to collect the claims. Once all c=
laims  had been collected they 
could be posted 
publicly for review by the=
 community in  general.  The experimenter could 
decide if any 
of the clai=
ms seemed to have hit, and this  decision could be reviewed by 
anyone if d=
esired. 
 
The important detail however is that this experiment  does not c=
ompletely 
answer the 
question. It is a first attempt and certainly can be=
  improved on 
successive trials.
 
Successive trials are always a good ide=
a, since it  provides replication. 
And it would be
best if others replicat=
ed the experiment using a very  similar protocol. If 
these were to
succeed=
, the community could then state that out of X  trials Y had 
succeeded (by=
 
some definition of success) potentially giving a  success rate above that=
 
expected 
by random chance. This would make the outcome  quantifiable and=
 measureable 
and thus meaningful.
 
But also important to note, this would=
 only prove the  potential veracity 
of the messages.
It would not (and can=
not as far as I can tell) prove  the origin of the 
messages. This detail
w=
ill, I fear, remain a matter for belief and  speculation for quite some 
ti=
me to come.
