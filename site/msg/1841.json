I can&#39;t hear much beyond that. If anyone can, have a \ntech check the power supply voltages at the board, there should be plus and \nminus 12 volts for the RVG, and pus 12 for the audio/tuner section. Look at \nit with a scope, maybe there a bad regulator, or bad power switch section. \nThe way it is, that box is about useless.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMessenger Caf��� ��� open for fun 24/7.
