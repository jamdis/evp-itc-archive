Some posts are made via email with attchments and the only way to recieve files that are attached to posts is to put your settings on individual email.\n\nMisty\n\n\n--- On Tue, 10/28/08, Allen &lt;amuck944@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: Allen &lt;amuck944@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: almost too embarassed to post this, but....\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, October 28, 2008, 3:20 PM\n&gt; I had the same problem.
