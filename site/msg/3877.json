I was given a tour and I was floating, I could not detect that I had a body. The place looked like a combination, lab, dispatch center and control room. It was fairly crowded and there were many what I would call technicians or engineers looking at various equipment, monitoring equipment.  Frank R was interested in heterodyne messages, I got another last night.\n&quot;Thanks to David heterodyne&quot;\n\nDave\n\n--- lisby@... wrote:\n\nFrom: Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] RS 12-469 Recordings using the Optical Microphone\nDate: Wed, 5 Dec 2007 04:47:38 -0500\n\nWhen you say control points, are we talking real, physical places or...?\n\nAnn\n\nOn Dec 4, 2007, at 7:18 PM, RetroCom wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Ann, I checked against the master wav file which is slightly  \n&gt; clearer and I still hear it the same. Yes, the voice sounds  \n&gt; distraught. In this very same session I can hear &#39;stations&#39; or  \n&gt; control points testing, some giving locations. Yesterday I posted  \n&gt; one that mentioned Amsterdam. In reviewing again today I can hear  \n&gt; another message that mentions New Zealand.\n&gt; &quot;Your coming through, you&#39;ve got Southern New Zealand&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n&gt; --- lisby@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] RS 12-469 Recordings using the Optical  \n&gt; Microphone\n&gt; Date: Tue, 4 Dec 2007 18:56:09 -0500\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m hearing &quot;I don&#39;t want to go,&quot; I think.

I get messages about heterodyning from time to\n&gt; &gt; time. The optical microphone system I use is ultra sensitive to low\n&gt; &gt; frequency vibrations. Perhaps they can use the &#39;Schuman resonance&#39;\n&gt; &gt; as a carrier.\n&gt; &gt; A couple more captures from this session. This first one is very\n&gt; &gt; emotional.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I don&#39;t really wanna die&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Give him more secrets&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dave\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;120307yourcomingthroughyougotsouthernnewzealand.mp3&gt;\n\n\n\n\r\n----__Part.20071205031831.8E6B0DA2\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;120407thankstodavidsheterodyne.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;120407thankstodavidsheterodyne.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n----__Part.20071205031831.8E6B0DA2--"}
