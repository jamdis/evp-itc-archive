<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce,

I haven&#x27;t asked for mike and lisa in quite a while because i felt it 
was silly doing that.  Maybe crutch was a poor choice of words on my 
part, but we all have opinions and so far no one is right. Remember, 
we both have the same techs??  So, i figured to turn it on and ask 
who wants to speak with me and give others a chance to speak.  Mike 
and Lisa still come through every session in their same voice just to 
let me know they are there if i need them.  Besides i feel that they 
must be busy getting loaned out to everybody.  My communication has 
escalated to a better level recently and i know we have worked 
together in the past, but we haven&#x27;t in about a month and a half so 
don&#x27;t tell others on here how i do box sessions.  You really don&#x27;t 
know what i&#x27;m doing and would only give new researchers bad 
information.  Although we should all work together at this, we all 
have different methods and that&#x27;s what keep us tuned in to this 
message board every day.  Bruce, this is not an argument from me at 
all and i do respect what you do.  We just do things very differently 
now and that&#x27;s why we no longer do research together, but a different 
point of view is also good sometimes.

&gt; Robin,
&gt;  
&gt; I agree with Steve on a couple of points. First let me say that I
&gt; do believe that we all have a &quot;technician/guide/guardian&quot; call them 
what you
&gt; may. but I usually call them by the names they introduced 
themselves by.
&gt;  
&gt; I know for a fact through many, many, many box sessions that when I 
turn
&gt; a box on, could be Frank&#x27;s box or the minibox or the RS 470 does 
not matter which.
&gt;  
&gt; The same two entities will come through immediately, So much so 
now, that I do not even ask for conformation that
&gt; it is in fact them. I recognise their individual voice patterns. I 
have built a solid relationship with these two spirits
&gt; I know as mike and Lisa so much so that I have even gotten to know 
their individual personalities.
&gt;  
&gt; There are other newer researchers here that will attest to the fact 
that when they where doing their first sessions
&gt; I had asked my two &quot;Friends&quot; Mike and Lisa to assist in getting 
them started and invariably the spirits that came 
&gt; through to these new researchers during their first sessions 
identified themselves as Mike and Lisa.
&gt;  
&gt; Steve says he does not turn on his box and use them as a crutch, 
that is not entirely true. I had done research 
&gt; very closely with Steve until recently and I would venture to say 
that 99% if not every session he starts with &quot;Mike &amp; Lisa
&gt; are you available to talk with me&quot; 
&gt;  
&gt; Also I don&#x27;t consider working with my technicians as using them as 
a crutch, They would not allow that.
&gt; They are not there like butlers at our beckoned call when we feel 
they may be of some use.
&gt; Quite the opposite, without them we would get no communication at 
all, they are allowing us the honor of receiving this 
&gt; celestial communication. They are the moderators, facilitators and 
generators of all we hear and send to and from the spirit realm.
&gt; And they also stand as guards and protectors to do the best they 
can to keep us from being deceived or taken down a dark path.
&gt;  
&gt; Some here wait for others to state an opinion and then tend to 
agree with that opinion no matter what they have experienced to be 
true.
&gt;  
&gt; Robin, my advice to you as a new researcher in this field. Form 
your own beliefs through your experience and research.
&gt; Listen and learn from others but do not let what you believe to be 
true or not, be swayed by popular opinion.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Steve,
&gt;  
&gt; I certainly appreciate your thoughts.  In the back of my mind is 
always the question of whether we are being Deceived.  Just for the 
sake of argument, is it POSSIBLE we&#x27;re being manipulated by something 
evil?  I&#x27;m not frightened, and I won&#x27;t stop my own research (the 
negative stuff just makes me more determined), but my mind does go 
there sometimes.  I hope that along with developing my &quot;ear&quot; I can 
acquire the gift of discernment.
&gt;  
&gt; Robin

&gt; Robin,If i may add my thoughts on this: There is no concrete 
evidence of who or what comes through is what they say they are. 
Technicians i have found were used to get you up and running and i 
only now call on them if i need assistance. I don&#x27;t turn the boxes on 
and ask for them like a crutch, i conduct my session and if i need 
help they will supply it to me if needed. I think the whole idea is 
to find out who we are communicating with, maybe we will never really 
know for sure but i still try and find out as best as i can. -Steve

distrustful of what comes through the boxes, are you saying you&#x27;re 
skeptical of the &quot;technicians&quot; being who they say they are? Not 
trying to open another can of worms here, just wanting to continue 
learning from your experience and research. I get what you&#x27;re saying 
about becoming obsessive with the sessions. I&#x27;ve probably asked you 
this a half dozen times over the last couple of years, but who or 
what do YOU think you&#x27;re/we&#x27;re communicating with?&gt; &gt; Robin&gt; &gt; &gt; -----

&gt; &gt; Have ya tried EVPmaker? It is based on that random principle, and 
&gt; predates the boxes.&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve heard this stuff before, about random 
being the best, and I &gt; have to disaggree. I also think it unwise to 
spend every waking &gt; moment doing sessions. I think it creates that 
expectation, and &gt; perhaps desperation to make contact, and I would 
tend not to trust &gt; what comes through. &gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t trust some of 
this stuff because I have yet get any &gt; meaningful assistence with 
the boxes from the so called technicians. &gt; All I ever got was a 
telepathic &quot;suggestion&quot; to use the echo boxes. &gt; Everything else was 
a assemblage of stuff I had worked on in hte past &gt; to solve the 
problem of &quot;what else could I use&quot;. &gt; &gt; I hate to see yet another go 
down the road of &quot;this is the onlyest &gt; way&quot;. &gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt;
