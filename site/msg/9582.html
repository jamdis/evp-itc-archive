Interesting files Bruce.  I hear all the words except the word THE in front of ORACLES.  Here I go again looking for meaning.  "Get off THE oracles" to me implies there is only one set of oracles that the speaker is referring to and you need to get off them.  While GET OFF ORACLES would of course be a much broader directive.  I took time to see what google lists for the word ORACLES and it lists everything from the common definition to descriptions of cryptic machines and the MS program Oracles 91 that has to do with processing information.  I copied the wik definition below if you are interested.  Possibly this word and message is worth further inquiry?  Great stuff.  Ron L
   
  An oracle is a person or agency considered to be a source of wise counsel or prophetic opinion; an infallible authority, usually spiritual in nature. It may also be a revealed prediction or precognition of the future, from deities, that is spoken through another object (e.g.: runemal) or life-form (e.g.: augury and auspice). In the ancient world many sites gained a reputation for the dispensing of oracular wisdom: they too became known as "oracles", and the oracular utterances, called khr�smoi in Greek, were often referred to under the same name � a name derived from the Latin verb �r�re, to speak.
