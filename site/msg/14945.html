Carradine Death Was Accidental

IMDb, June 4, 2009

David Carradine die=
d during a sex game that went wrong, according to sources in Bangkok, Thail=
and, where he was found dead on Thursday.

Carradine's body was discovered =
in a hotel suite and local reports suggested he committed suicide. 

He was=
 discovered by a maid, naked and hanged, but the suggestions his death had =
a sexual twist were strongly disputed by the star's close friend, attorney =
Vicki Roberts, and his manager Chuck Binder, who insisted he died of natura=
l causes. 

But a statement from Carradine's representative now indicates t=
he actor died during a sex act.

The spokesperson tells TMZ.com, "We can co=
nfirm 100 percent that he never would have committed suicide. It was an acc=
idental death. Everybody is in shock." 

Rumours Carradine died attempting =
auto-erotic asphyxiation- -where victims achieve heightened sexual pleasure=
 by restricting their air supply are backed up by a quote a Bangkok police =
officer gave to British newspaper The Sun. 

The cop tells reporters, "A ro=
pe was attached to his neck and also to his penis". 

Rocker Michael Hutche=
nce was rumoured to have died attempting the same sex act in a Sydney, Aust=
ralia, hotel room back in 1997--although his death was officially declared =
a suicide.

Carradine was in Thailand to shoot the movie "Stretch." He was =
72.
