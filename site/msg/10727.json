I was wondering on how the systems w=\r\nithout echo chambers that are hooked to direct output of an audio jack work=\r\ned  and if the spirits were indeed interacting with the electronic internal=\r\ns.  I figured the box was there to enhance communication of cleaner evp of =\r\nsorts.  I&#39;ve used several different size boxes and materials as well, but I=\r\n haven&#39;t tried copper yet.  I&#39;ve used copper on other projects thought and =\r\nhad great success.  I don&#39;t know why I haven&#39;t tried in on this one.  I wil=\r\nl have to run down to the hardware store for some materials and build a 4x6=\r\n as you suggested.  I used a basic plastic box to help with noise filtering=\r\n from outside influence but I was wondering about it&#39;s effects.  That&#39;s ver=\r\ny interesting mentioning the different levels of interaction based on mater=\r\nial.  I&#39;m going to have to run some tests based on the different echo boxes=\r\n I have and see what happens for me.  Hopefully I&#39;ll get as good\n results a=\r\ns others as long as I keep plugging away at it.   I believe your right thou=\r\ngh, I don&#39;t want to drive myself nuts trying to figure it out, especially o=\r\nvernight.\n\nAll the best,\nBryan\n\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: purplesp=\r\nacefriend &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Mond=\r\nay, April 28, 2008 2:07:34 PM\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Copper Channels\n\n\nI gu=\r\ness there is form of mechanical filtering going on.

This is \nfor resonance i=\r\nnside the box(hence the name echo chamber) correct? \n&gt; \n&gt; So things I possi=\r\nbly need to take into consideration when building \nmine are:\n&gt; a.  Types of=\r\n material provide better results, copper and aluminum \nversus materials tha=\r\nt absorb/dampen such as egg crate foam or cloth \nlining.\n&gt; b.  Size of box =\r\n(length, width, height) to produce the suspected \nresonance frequency.\n&gt; c.=\r\n  Amount of chambers (I noticed 3 is the magical number ) \nHaving chambers =\r\nincreases the resonance effect more than just having \nan empty box without =\r\nchambers. \n&gt; d.  Outside influence such as air which is why Frank mentioned=\r\n it \nneeding to be air-tight\n&gt; e.  The types of outside influence is from t=\r\nhe spirits getting to \nthe inside.  So is it or is it not a good idea to wr=\r\nap the box in \nabsorbing/dampening materials since they are manipulating th=\r\ne sound \ninside a box?  I wouldn&#39;t think that it would matter what&#39;s on the=\r\n \noutside as long as noise from the outside isn&#39;t bombarding the \noutsides =\r\nof the box causing internal problems and distorting \nanything.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pardon =\r\nmy thought process, but I&#39;m just trying to learn the \nconcepts here.
