<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Ron you saved me alot of typing LOL

You are correct RJ, if you are still in the stage of how and why and looking for &quot;proof&quot; it is better to do experiments and sharing the way you describe. Go for it.

And Ron already knows me well. I am a little beyond caring how or why it works, or even asking spirits questions. I just record thier chatter, document for my own learning, and share with a few friends or persons its meant for privately. Once in a while I post samples for others who are curious about the different methods being used or new to the subject. 

I never expect anyone to hear anything as I do, its a nice surprise when someone does =)

Good luck!

Misty

&gt; Hello RJ  You make good points here.  I had to re look at
&gt; the purpose of the group to see if this was a scientific
&gt; research group or other.  It looks like it is in the
&gt; &quot;or other&quot; category.  I do believe there are
&gt; strictly research groups around that can apply the rules of
&gt; scientific testing.  More in the hobbyist or enthusiast
&gt; mode?
&gt;  
&gt; One  of the reasons I joined this group is because I
&gt; appreciate members like Misty for posting their work and
&gt; not having to do so under some scientific
&gt; methodology.  That, I think, would hinder innovation,
&gt; testing, sharing and even enjoyment of what we do here. 
&gt; And, again, it is not the stated purpose of this
&gt; group.  Doubters and debunkers certainly have a place in
&gt; this non-scientific arena, but here I hope to see posts from
&gt; people who are not afraid to try a technique and then share
&gt; it with others.  I was looking for your posts with the
&gt; group here...do you have any?  I do not mean that as a
&gt; challenge...I am sincerely interested in hearing your
&gt; clips.   best wishes   ron l  
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I know what you mean Misty - it does seem that
&gt; interpretations are often varied.  I am thinking that the
&gt; best way to make progress is to get an audio sample that you
&gt; think is most representative of a given approach&#x27;s
&gt; effectiveness, and send that privately to several people. 
&gt; Name the file something innocuous (like File1) and
&gt; don&#x27;;t tell the people you send it to what you think you
&gt; hear.  Also, ask the people not to discuss the file with
&gt; anyone else, and have them send what they think they hear
&gt; directly back to you,rather than posting the results in a
&gt; forum or group.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that kind of test is helpful, since it seems to me
&gt; that once someone tells me what the audio clip sounds like,
&gt; then it&#x27;s hard for me to hear anything else in it. 
&gt; But,that could be influencing my interpretation (like
&gt; someone pointing to a cloud, telling me its a horse, and
&gt; then I have trouble NOT seeing a horse) ,so it&#x27;s better
&gt; to listen before it is suggested to me what i should be
&gt; hearing.
&gt; 
&gt; This way, I think the most progress can be made, because if
&gt; people just keep confirming what we think we hear, and it
&gt; turns out it&#x27;s just noise that we are forcing an
&gt; interpretation into, we won&#x27;t be making progress (though
&gt; it might make us feel good to believe that we&#x27;re being
&gt; successful).  Getting negative feedback to one&#x27;s
&gt; approach is not as fun, and might feel like some
&gt; non-believer is trying to debunk us.  But, really, that can
&gt; be the best feedback for progress, since it helps us to
&gt; change tactics when our current approach is not effective,
&gt; rather than continuing down an ineffective path, getting
&gt; accolades from friends, but missing out on other paths that
&gt; might show more promise,.

&gt; Thanks RJ
&gt; 
&gt; I never know who will hear what. No matter which method is
&gt; used. Everyone hears differently, different speaker setups,
&gt; different software. I just post a variety of whats clear to
&gt; me using different methods. Sometimes the one thats not one
&gt; I think of as clear is the one everyone agrees on as being
&gt; clear. Go figure.

&gt; &gt; If you&#x27;d like some feedback, I could definitely
&gt; make out
&gt; &gt; what sounded like water, and perhaps slowed down
&gt; water. 
&gt; &gt; But other than that, it seemed a strain to me to
&gt; attribute
&gt; &gt; any of those noises to anything vocal or intelligent.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Just my opinion,

&gt; &gt; Heres a few voices from my latest session
&gt; &gt; recording water then slowing down -74% in audacity.
&gt; For me
&gt; &gt; they are quite loud and the clarity was great. I
&gt; recorded
&gt; &gt; these on a night of the full moon (which does seem to
&gt; help).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Attaching a few of the clearer ones to this post and
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; those who dont get the dailies you can listen on my
&gt; esnips
&gt; &gt; site. For the other methods click on my profile there
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; you will see folders listed.
