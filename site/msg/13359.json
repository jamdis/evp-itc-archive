I have a linear scan \ncircuit \n&gt; that varies output voltage 1-8 volts by a 50k pot. I am very new at \n&gt; this, but later today I am hoping to have it working on the \n&gt; breadboard, I just need a candidate radio to  apply it to. I was \n&gt; wondering which pin in particular it was. I don&#39;t have my 469 anymore \n&gt; so I cant look at it, and all online pics are too small. I appreciate \n&gt; any help.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; thanks\n&gt; Andy\n&gt;"}
