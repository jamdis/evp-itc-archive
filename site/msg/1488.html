<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>All i have is a small FM linear Box with a tiny perf board.  Seems 
to work well for me.  Maybe cheap and simple is the answer.  The 
answers and sentences they form come with time using the box and not 
how fantastic the sweep is.  They can use anything, but i&#x27;m trying 
random tuning next to compare to my linear.  There is a picture of 
my box in the Photos section here.  Nothing fancy, as a matter of 
fact, it&#x27;s pretty flimsy but works and that&#x27;s important.  Cost was 
under $100 with radio shack parts, you just need someone to build it 
that knows what they are doing.

&gt; Thanks. It&#x27;s not so much evolution, it&#x27;s using what I have, like 
the scrap 
&gt; piece of aluminum for the panel. The next &quot;evolution&quot; will be the 
printed 
&gt; circuit board. Of course I keep adding functions, which means more 
board 
&gt; real estate, which raises costs. I really want the linear sweep, 
and tone 
&gt; injection to be standard functions. It would be interesting to use 
all 
&gt; stereo speakers, and mics in the echo boxes, but that almost 
doubles the 
&gt; components again. I&#x27;ve thought about a stripped down version, like 
just the 
&gt; tuner and sweep generator, then use something like a boom box for 
the all 
&gt; the audio and recording functions. If it was only linear sweep, 
the system 
&gt; could be made on a small board===cheap.
