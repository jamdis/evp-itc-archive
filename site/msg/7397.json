As far a people taking what you say to be negative, well if they do oh well they will get over it.  I personally don&#39;t think there are any experts, which is my opinion for what it is worth and I am sure I will catch hell over my statement.  I for one can not say or confirm who I am talking to, nor will I ever be able to (well maybe when I&#39;m dead) if they are in fact spirits from the other side or other life forms from different planets.  I do however know that I love the communication who ever they are and pretty much have to leave it at that.  I think this is what makes it so fascinating to me, that so much of the communication we receive is unknown in origin.  You have taught us that we should take this as it comes, and not hold too much truth to some of the messages.  \n   \n                 You for one designed each an every box differently, having its own unique features about them.  From white noise generators, to random, to lunar, etc..  You adapted them as you went, so if anyone has experimented the most in this field, I would say it certainly would be you.  The never ending days and hours you have spent creating these devices truly surpass all of us combined time in the research end, so I don&#39;t think I have to say anymore there.\n   \n   I can only speak for myself, but I feel that your contributions are extremely important and are needed.  You have helped and touched peoples lives many you will probably never know of or meet.  It is because of your desire and constant dedication with your building of perfection that you have allowed us an opportunity to experience what you do knowing that there is more out there than just us, in our selfish world of our.\n   \n  Hell I&#39;m calling it a good day when I can turn my TV remote on,  so I know I certainly count on you for your experiences in obtaining the best communication!\n   \n  Juli\n   \n   \n   \n                   \n   \n                   \n  \nFrank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n           I was going to make comments about box use, but so far it always falls on deaf ears, and gets taken as being negative, so screw it, the &quot;experts&quot; can hash it out.
