I got good results when I used SoundSoap2 \nwith the allophones files as well.  And, I really like it for it&#39;s standard use of noise \nreduction.  :0)\n\nMaragret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I figured i would do an introduction for those who don&#39;t know about the \n&gt; program.  Sound Soap is a manual tuning method to an audio file.  It \n&gt; has a bar on the bottom that can be manually moved by the user with the \n&gt; mouse.  What i did today was experiment with Stefan&#39;s Allophone file \n&gt; into the Sound Soap program and manual sweep the audible tones.  I \n&gt; think this may be the best files i ever got so far, please listen and \n&gt; let me know what you guys think.  These files were from a 3 min. \n&gt; session with minimal editing.  I&#39;ve had this program for months and \n&gt; never used it, i think Bruce gave it to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
