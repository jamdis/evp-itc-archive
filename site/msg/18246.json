First one to contact me will get this one.  Did you get the box from Mike yet?  This is the same model that chris used in his box, see how that one works first before you buy another.\n\nThanx,\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Does any one have the link on ebay for this? is it still up.

The AM is staticy, but the FM sounds ok. I really don&#39;t like this radio model much, the sweep circuit if fine but the radio is iffy for sound quality on AM.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m willing top let this go for cheap to the first person who contacts me about it. No Ebay auction this time, just a straight up sale.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m looking for $75 plus shipping costs.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
