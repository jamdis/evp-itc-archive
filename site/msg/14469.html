Yeah-try to look at it unbiased, back from ground zero and see if you get a=
 different message.

  Yes-perfect example of aud=
ible scrying.



  What's happening is that the random audio is just a back=
ground used for you to scry into. Infact, if this is what is happening, I b=
et if you could get the "Your mom is calling" message out of your head and =
listen to that same track on another occasion, you may hear a completely di=
fferent message.



  This could also be why Frank has reported that his me=
ssages change from what he first heard.



  In essence, it isn't the physi=
cal recording sounds giving you the message, it is your subconscious mind.

    Okay I have another one=
 for you to think about.. I tape a session and review it later..  even a da=
y later.  Upon review the message that comes over is about something that '=
just happened' while I was reviewing or happened after taping?  Is it possi=
ble that spirit can manipulate the recording AFTER recording has stopped or=
 even manipulate the audio while reviewing?

    An give you an example of =
this I was recording one day and I reviewed the audio the next day.  While =
reviewing - about half way through - the message "Your mother is calling" w=
as found.  I saved it and moved on and within two seconds my mom called.  Y=
ou say it is a coincidence except that I hadn't spoken to my mother in over=
 a year.  During this same conversation with her - we sorta made amends and=
 I told her the story of the 'secret' I had found out about a family member=
 having a child out of wedlock in the late 1920s.  Quick backstory.. I foun=
d out about this out-of-wedlock birth through my genealogy research and con=
tacted spirit through the box and I was promptly told to keep it secret and=
 which I promised to do.

    Well in this conversation with my mom after n=
ot speaking for a year I told her what I had found out.  When the telephone=
 conversation ended with my mom. I was amazed that the recording had told m=
e she would call right be fore she did - even though the audio was recorded=
 the previous day.  I proceeded to go back to reviewing the audio and the v=
ery first thing I heard was:  THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SECRET - YOU LIED.
=

    Maybe they can manipulate 'real-time' literally????

   2 different things happening-that's why. When you get EVP that everyone =
understands, it is outward, in the environment. Not a communication through=
 subconscious means.

    EVP that people swear they hear, but noone else c=
an make sense, may be a message to them via subconscious means. That isn't =
to say that ALL EVP's like this are true messages, I am sure alot are just =
matrixing.

    But then that is how the art of scrying starts-matrixing. L=
ike the Rorschach tests. The images you matrix with those gives the psychol=
ogist an insight into your mind.

    By gazing into a dark, reflective sur=
face, you start to see cloudy images. At first, you will just be matrixing =
faces in the clouds and not getting much substance. Try it, you will see wh=
at I am saying. With practice, you start to see clear, concise images.

   =
 I think that is what happening with audio as well.

    We already know fo=
r a fact pareidolia can occur in audio as well as visual stimulus.

    I don't know for sure about that one either, but I am not ready to disc=

        I think that is the problem I am having though Jim.  When you=
