After all, the dates could refer to something in their world, not ours, but still show up here as energy anomalies... if we know where to look.\n\nChecking last year&#39;s EGG composite numbers, I see a notable drop between August 14th (7 spikes) and 15th (7 spikes), and the 16th (4 spikes) and the 17th (3 spikes).\n\nThat doesn&#39;t mean anything, of course, but it&#39;s something that I check now & then. (I&#39;d have a better sense of the significance if  August&#39;s monthly graph was available, but that file is showing no data right now.)\n\nOn May 7th of this year, there was a significant dip (6 spikes on the 6th, 2 on the 7th, then 6 on the 8th).  But, it was one of three similar dips this month.  I&#39;m not sure that they correlate to anything geopolitical.\n\nThere may come a time when the puzzle pieces fit together.  Until then, I feel a little color-blind trying to figure which piece goes where, and which aren&#39;t even part of the puzzle I&#39;m studying!\n\nCheerfully,\nFiona\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;ve gotten dates before, and nothing happens. It&#39;s a non-specific\n&gt; rpediction, so it doesn&#39;t mean much. We had August 15th last year, nothing,\n&gt; and I had May 7th, this year, nothin&#39;. someday something will happen on one\n&gt; of these dates and we&#39;ll have our proof ;-0\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
