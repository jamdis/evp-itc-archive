There&#39;s mold, dust, dirt, insects, rat and\n&gt; mouse droppings that contain viruses and bacteria, lead based paint,\n&gt; asbestos, radon, and who knows what other toxins. No one takes any\n&gt; precautions, they get this stuff in their hair, clothes, and cars, then\n&gt; bring it home to their children, freinds and families, then wonder why the\n&gt; kids are getting wierd deseases. Who is going to pay your health bills, the\n&gt; property owners, the event promoters? I don&#39;t think so! Still think it&#39;s all\n&gt; fun and games, a quest for fame and fortune?\n&gt; \n&gt;  I wouldn&#39;t go ghost hunting without a full hasmat suit, including a\n&gt; respirator!\n&gt; \n&gt;  Just tell yourselves I don&#39;t know anything, bring your pregnant wife on\n&gt; your hunts, or your newborns--couldn&#39;t hurt--right?\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;"}
