<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Its very unfortunate, those people probably think that you will just 
keep them if they were sent to you to fix or what have you. Which is 
pretty dumb considering you gave it to them in the first place. I do 
applaud you though however for trying to at least advance 
parapsychology in what you are doing and freely supplying paranormal 
investigators with your tool/box.

&gt; Hey Frank-R;
&gt; 
&gt; Yahoo marked your message as spam, and I can&#x27;t go approve it from 
here at 
&gt; work. But anyway, I don&#x27;t know if I should name names, in an 
attempt to be a 
&gt; nicer bitch. I don&#x27;t get it, I made the damn things, gave them 
away free, 
&gt; yet I can&#x27;t be trusted to fix it, or at least verify the box works 
for me. I 
&gt; think there may indeed be a limit, or at least a certain state of 
mind for 
&gt; users. So I guess these people are left with ugly little door 
stops? I tried 
&gt; to e-mail  but one e-mail came back, the other ignored,  so I&#x27;m 
thinkin&#x27; 
&gt; blocked maybe, which does not show they are anymore honest then 
the user 
&gt; they all hate------without naming names. BTW-Steve&#x27;s not one of 
these 
&gt; people.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This probably sounds vague, but they know who they are, and I 
don&#x27;t get a 
&gt; response any other way, so probably a mis-use of the group, sorta.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I didn&#x27;t realize just how crappy car tuners were until I got the 
homebrew 
&gt; tuner working. I don&#x27;t have anywhere near the static and noise in 
the HB 
&gt; tuner.
