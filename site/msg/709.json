I have no idea if my neighbors have anything\ngo on, but this house does.\nits just you cant count on it... it may be silent for 6 months  then active\n4 , then quite another 3 months and then active for 10 months.\nwe never know.  it happens when it happens.\nand usually when we least expect it.\nwe are usually watching a movie on tv, working on the computer, or trying to\nsleep.\nI think something just resides with us ..and goes about its business and\ncrosses paths with us... but, my family hears a woman call their name , and\nI have heard a male voice call my name.  and my poor cats hear someone call\nthem and come running and then cant find them. I heard something call one of\nmy cats and I got chills all over because that spooked me. as it was\nstanding near me when it did that. the sound came from near me ..and I knew\nit wasnt me. (I cant make that particular sound).\nits been quiet for a couple months now... so no telling when it will start\nup again.\nI should have been paying more attention, to see when its most active.. but\nI had not thought of that before.\n\nLyn"}
