Then I try to find the source of the tuning \nvoltage so I can cut the trace coming from the processor. Every once \nin a while I find a radio that has the radio functions marked, like \nin the Radio Shack 12-469, or 820. The 12-470 has similar markings, \nbut it&#39;s alot more difficult to use. \n\n I use to think I had to use older digital car radios, but I&#39;m find \nnewer radio usable, like digital clock radios, and radio/cd players. \n\n Frank-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jess Rogers&quot; &lt;jessadr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; what do you look fot inside the cheap radios to mod? is it a mute \nfunction, or do you have to build a circuit for tuning?\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Frank Sumption \n&gt;   To: Group \n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, August 13, 2008 2:54 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [EVP-ITC] The Frankenator\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Yet another thrift store radio, a &quot;digital&quot; AM/FM/CD player.
