I had another box request recieved a via \nsnail mail, asking for a &quot;digital box&quot;, I don&#39;t know where they got idea. \nThey also sent along a series of CDs that were excepts of channeled material \ntalking about &quot;the telephone to the dead&quot;. I thought I would at least see \nwhat was on it, so started listening to the first CD, the dog went totally \nbonkers, running around the house barking and howling! I stpped the play \nback, and put the stuff back in it&#39;s box to ship back.\n\nThe little that I did hear, as I kinda scanned through the first track, was \npretty religious sounding, with some guy talking in a very deep mono tone. I \ndon&#39;t have time to try to sort that BS out, and I am not impressed with \nsupposed spiritual revelations.  Ya reach a point after 40 years of reading, \nand other sources, that you develope pretty good BS detectors. I got \ninterested in paranormal stuff when I was 13.\n\nI also get the flickering lights, and thumps in the walls, but nothing ever \nburns up, or stops working, except from normal failure.\n\nFrank-S\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nhttp://imagine-windowslive.com/hotmail/?locale=en-us&ocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_mini_2G_0507"}
