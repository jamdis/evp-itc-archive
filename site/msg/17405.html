Exactly what is your purpose here? These kind of "drive-by" comments with s=
nide remarks are extremely childish. Commenting on another's post is more a=
ppropriate.

Frank,

Very interesting. It's been a while since=
 I've listenend to your files. The fm on this tuner sounds really active; t=

This is what I hear (in stu=
dio grade headphones):

Your AM file @ 03 secs: "Here Prin Cess" (male + tw=
o escalating tones)
@ 11 secs: "Be sure (static) good news" (male)

Your FM=
 file @ 01 secs: "Trying to get through" (in female tones)
@ 03 secs: "It d=
on't ?boost? right" (male then two tones)
@ 05 secs: "Closer to cooperating=
? " (male, first vowel sound is hard and second vowel sound in this word is=
 a soft 'a' or 'o' so it cannot be calamity)
@ 06 secs: "Till we're done" (=
female, fast)
@ 08 secs: "Frank" (male)
@ 09 secs: "Hi" (female singing, dr=
awn out) 
@ 11 secs: "How you doing" (male)
@ 14 secs: "Hi" (female or chil=
