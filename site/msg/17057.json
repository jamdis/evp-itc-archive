I think we ought to pull our claws back in, especially me!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have gotten &quot;voices&quot; that I thought were perfectly clear, and no one\n&gt; else could hear it, and some I found was just a snippet of music, so yeah,\n&gt; that happens, but it does not eliminate or explain everything from the\n&gt; boxes, and other EVP methods, you just have to be aware of the possibility.\n&gt; Anotherr problem is broadcast fragments, sometimes they are just what they\n&gt; sound like, an ad for one thing or another, sometimes they can have\n&gt; sychronistic meaning, and sometimes they can be altered in some way to form\n&gt; a messages, such as the recent one I had about learning sex, which was\n&gt; seemingly ignored by all cuz it has the &quot;s&quot; word--I guess. The fragments can\n&gt; also be distorted as the radio tuning is swept across a station, I don&#39;t\n&gt; accept every word and syllable as meaning something. You have tio judge\n&gt; mnessage by content and personal meaning.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have seen faces stand up in a carpet right in front of me, not\n&gt; something I just happened across, something that happened live as I watched.\n&gt; For someone to suggest that&#39;s imagination I find very offensive.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When I first switched to a linear sweep in the boxes, I could hear\n&gt; nothing but gibberish, then suddenly I could hear &quot;them&quot; speaking. I doubt\n&gt; that is all imagination either, I think the mind(which is not brain) has to\n&gt; reprogram the ears, which are brain, to hear. I also think the skeptics can\n&gt; not allow this programming to take place, hence they can&#39;t hear. I would be\n&gt; very surprised if any of the hard core skeptics even turned on a box for\n&gt; fear that they may hear something that&#39;s not there. Rorke(the Phd) implied\n&gt; as much when he wanted a box to test, or more like debunk. That crap is\n&gt; frikkin&#39; pathetic!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; F-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Apr 23, 2010 at 4:30 PM, April Abercrombie &lt;april@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Pareidolia is not psuedo science.

I chose the Wikipedia version because I thought it\n&gt; would be the least offensive to you. Other articles specifically called out\n&gt; EVP and other things.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For the record, I don&#39;t think all EVP&#39;s are due to pareidolia.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Apr 23, 2010 at 3:47 PM, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It was implied that all this stuff is &quot;Pareidolia&quot;, and because you could\n&gt; put a name on it that somehow meant it was all explanined. I&#39;ve been hearing\n&gt; this pseudo scientific BS for 10 years, so I&#39;m a bit touchy. Science\n&gt; explains the paranormal away, and yet people continune to photograph images,\n&gt; and get their names, and the names of deseased loved ones through EVP, as\n&gt; well as questions answered, and science(althogh not all scientists) just\n&gt; ignores these inconvinient facts and focuses on that we might see things\n&gt; that are not there, which I disagree with as well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Did you even bother looking at the image on the group home page. That was\n&gt; from sweeping a TV tuner with a random voltage and video recording the\n&gt; monitor screen. So explain away why there is a wolf image embedded in the\n&gt; guy&#39;s hat, an image of an alien below his ear, and why in God&#39;s name does he\n&gt; resembles the classic description of an MIB or Shadow Person?
