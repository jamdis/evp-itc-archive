It's really amazing to see that, time after time, that really seems to be the case.  Mark Macy has told me over and over that the vibrations are the most important thing.  Over and over and over.  I guess I really need to concentrate more on centering myself.
   
  On the files: it was the phrases that I didn't hear very clearly, though they were definitely there--just of much lower quality than your usual files, which are among the best in my opinion.

  Thanks for your reply,
  Ursula

          Ursula,
 
I don't know if you listened to all the files in the folder
there where a couple of clear ones but mostly yes and no answers.
 
From what I can piece together our friends on the other side are
having a problem with the radio signal due to atmospheric conditions.
 
and a problem with negative energy that caused sort of a ripple affect
after the negativity surrounding the group last week.
 
I'm sure they will sort it out and it will be back to buisness as usual.
steve and I have experienced this a number of times and it seems to go up and down
not to worry they are still there and just as frustrated as we are.
 
It is just another example of what can be caused by researchers having negative
energy and vibrations.

        Bruce,
  Good job pulling those files out--you're right, as you said on one of them, the reception is not good at all. These are of a much poorer quality than you usually get.  It's been a bad few days for a lot of people , I think.  Thanks for posting; it encourages me to keep going even though it's dry . . .
