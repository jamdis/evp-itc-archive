Also, has anybody ever though of recording \nan EVP Maker session in MP3 format and play it back later plugged into \nspeakers through an MP3 player while asking questions.  I had attempted \nit about a year ago with minimal success.  I think they need the live \nstream, but if anybody is willing to test it out i would love to hear \nthe results.\n\n-Steve H."}
