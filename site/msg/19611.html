I'v=
e seen live webcast of ITC sessions where GB output is fed directly into th=
e mic line in on a computer running Adobe Audition with the spectragraph ru=
nning. It was really compelling to see letters and numbers, not images or p=
ictures, but partial words appear in the graph. At first it was I thought i=
t was a software glitch but it is a repeatable event. It was on LiveSciFi w=
hich is run by Tim Wood, he also thought there was some kind of code error =
but it happened on more than one webcast. 

So if anyone has Audition, just=
 feed Box output right in your computer and see what happens. I wanted to t=
ry it tonight but I have Audacity and the spectragraph feature doesn't have=
 that shaded appearance that Audition does so it's not able to render image=
s or characters, at least as far as I see using the various settings.
