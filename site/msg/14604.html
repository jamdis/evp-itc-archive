Awesome!

At this point I will go ahead and say what I hear. I hear a male =
voice say "Hello". Close enough to "Uh oh"...so I'll take it! LOL!

Though =
it is a bit clich=E9, it makes sense, because I was just returning to this =
room. There was no living being in the entire upstairs except for me.

I am=
 looking forward to seeing the night vision camera footage of this instant =
to see if anything shows up there.
