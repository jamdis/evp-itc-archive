I'll give him this: he has amazing balls to be using Frank's de=
vice and tell ing the rest who are also using them that his is the only one=
 that works. If I were Frank, I'd be beating my head against the wall. Oh. =
Wait. He already is. 

What a total load of ego-driven crap. 

Chris, if yo=
u're reading, may I suggest that you are the one who is falling victim to "=
false" communication? Or that your head is getting waaaay too big? Or if yo=
u already know that you're just in it for the cash, that you find another w=
ay to pay your bills?

You know, though, this same shit has happened to eve=
ry group of paranormal researchers since the field began. I've watched grou=
p after group come together and explode for thirty years because only the C=
hosen had the right to control the message, would broke no criticism of *an=
y* of their own results *ever*, but had plenty of definitive pronouncements=
 about everyone else's.

This is why I scoff at the idea of "Harmony," with=
 the capital H. I have seen the concept used by everyone from the Warrens i=
n the 60s-70s to the Harsch-Fischbachs in the early 80s to Moon today tryin=
g to use this idea of being somehow chosen and sacred in order to get "real=
" messages from spirit. Harmony is a way to control who gets to play and IM=
HO, it's a load of nonsense.

Bruce, I have to tell you that the message yo=
u got the other day about us being all Kumbaya set my alarms off, perhaps i=
nnocently, but nonetheless. I've found there is such a fine line between re=
al peace between brothers working for the real common good and peace betwee=
n brothers as a mechanism of control. Yes, we need to be at peace to work t=
ogether. But that peace has to be an inclusive peace. It has to be a peace =
within one's self above all else. It needs to be a *fearless* interior peac=
e, too. The Harmony is within, folks. It's not judging whether others have =
it or not before we let them play. It is pure, unadulterated *internal* kno=

November 28, 2007 The Box has hit the fan! Current mood: distressed Categor=
y: Dreams and the Supernatural As so many of you know, I have been the prim=
ary tester of the Telephone to the Dead, a.k.a. "Frank's Box" since 2004, a=
nd have had great success using it in paranormal research, and more current=
ly, connecting the living with those on the other side. I have recently bee=
n made aware that there are several replica versions of this device being s=
old. I have also been told of another device that can be purchased for very=
 little from any electronics merchant and altered by hand, producing what s=
ome consider to be results. As I expected, the samples that people have sen=
t me are nothing more than timed radio scans that have no validity. What is=
 important to remember, before purchasing any of these replica devices, is =
that the Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides on the other side have repeat=
edly explained that the way that the Telephone to the Dead technology works=
, is by spirit energy manipulating the random voltage generator (RVG) and u=
sing white and pink noise, as well as radio fragment, to create real time v=
oice answers to questions posed from our side. The most important aspect to=
 this device is the medium operator who works as an antenna or "interpreter=
" for living individuals asking the questions. Thomas Edison, in an intelli=
gent spiritual discussion through the Telephone to the Dead, stated that th=
ere were only thirty of these individuals that could effectively use the de=
vice. Four have been identified to this point. I have spent nearly four yea=
rs testing and doing paranormal research with the Telephone to the Dead, an=
d I have built strong relationships with Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guid=
es who I trust, and who trust me. These new "radio scanners" are not only a=
 waste of money for people looking to do research with them in hopes of hav=
ing effective communication with the other side, but may in fact be very da=
ngerous. Should demonic and other negative entities learn to use these fals=
e devices, the results could be devastating. Though I rarely see eye to eye=
 with the Catholic Church on the matter of using the Telephone to the Dead,=
 I do admit that they predicted the widespread sale of false communication =
devices as far back as last year. I have recently begun to receive requests=
 from individuals asking for help to close negative doorways and portals th=
at they believe they opened using their purchased Telephone to the Dead rep=
lica. Others are claiming that I am a fraud because their purchased device =
doesn't produce the positive results I have been fortunate enough to have, =
and claim that therefore, all of my results MUST be false. I can see this s=
piraling out of control already. Once again, I will continue my research wi=
th the actual Telephone to the Dead as well as provide public demonstration=
s and private readings for those truly interested in real time spirit commu=
nication. Please feel free to contact me with any questions atBruce
