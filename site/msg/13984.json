Anyway, we had regular spirit meetings, right from Heaven, and spirit came through and told us that &quot;one day people would have a thing that fits on the arm, like a watch with a cell the size of a dime,&quot;  and we here would be able to talk with our loved ones on the other side.  They mentioned the word, &quot;cell&quot; before computer&#39;s ever came out.  Don&#39;t know who the inventor will be, it could be one of you folks perhaps, and I am letting you know now, that it is possible.  Sure wish I had one of those Spirit phone&#39;s you folks are able to build.  Well, just thought you would like to know, and I have passed it on to a couple of other people, now get to work!  &lt;g&gt;  btw.  Spirit told us that it is &quot;true about Edison, he was working on a spirit box device to talk to the other side.&quot;   I  am looking for a set for myself, do you know of anyone that could make one for me or where i can get all the necessary equipment so i can start working with the one to one commumication, i&#39;m not good at hooking stuff up so well, and wire are not my speciality.  But i believe you are all onto something very wonderful.  As i have informed a couple of people all ready, someone doing this type of research will eventually invent a product that will be worn on the arm like a watch.  Thanks so much,\nsf"}
