<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Sure, comments are always welcome either good or bad.  That&#x27;s how we 
progress in what we do, different points of view are always 
important.  This research is still new and very unexplainable, but we 
devise theories (Not Facts) as we go along in hopes that we are right 
or at least on the right path.  I have several samples and 
information on my web site if you are interested in how i go about 
what i call RTSC (Real Time Spirit Communication) research.

www.keyportparanormal.com

I also have a yahoo group dedicated to this with some of our theories 
and documents that we feel might help others in understanding this a 
bit more.  Other opinions of course are always welcome.

&gt; Steve, I do try to be skeptical. But just to clear things up here, 
I&#x27;ve never said that I believed that real time spirit communication 
is not possible.  While many people here bring skills in electronics 
to this field, I try to help out in the area of process and 
methodology.  I think a lot of attention has been put on the 
equipment, and on the efforts to collect data. And that&#x27;s great. My 
opinion is that less has been put on process and methodology, which I 
feel is just as important, and can be just as difficult, as the other 
areas. Part of that is interpretation of the data, which is 
generally where you&#x27;ll find me trying to add value to the 
conversation or commenting on the techniques I see.
&gt; 
&gt; If you would like me to comment on your other files, I&#x27;d be happy 
too. But I&#x27;ll leave that call up to you.

&gt; Of course i wanted comments.  Based on your previous posts on this 
&gt; 
&gt; group, you don&#x27;t believe that real time spirit communication is 
&gt; 
&gt; possible.  I just wanted to post a couple files proving otherwise, 
&gt; 
&gt; but i will take what you say into consideration.  I appreciate the 
&gt; 
&gt; honest responses.

&gt; &gt; I was adding to interpretations made by other forum members.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m not ignoring or arguing anything. I&#x27;m only saying what I 
heard.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Did you not want comments?

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Really????  What about the other 2 files i posted?  You can&#x27;t 
deny 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; that there is some sort of communication going on, even the 
hardest 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; skeptics as yourself have to admit the validity of those files.  
I 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; believe in a random chance of a stray radio signal coinsiding 
with 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; the question asked at that time, but after 2 years and 4000 files 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; later i have to believe that this communication is real.  I also 
&gt; 
&gt; use 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; other methods that do not involve a radio at all, what could make 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; that happen?  These are all good questions to make someone re-
think 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; their stance on RTSC and other ITC devices.  How can a scrambled 
up 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; file on a computer program called evpmaker say full sentences up 
to 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 25 words in length?  Did i mention that the original file that 
was 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; used had no words in it at all, only bits and pieces of audio 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; segments.  Something to think about anyway.  I used to stand on 
&gt; 
&gt; your 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; side of the fence, but after a while it can no longer be ignored 
&gt; 
&gt; that 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; what we are hearing is really happening.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If I try to work out the sounds as phonemes, it sounds like:

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ah He La Naw Tay

&gt; &gt; &gt; Try reading that: Ah He La Naw Tay

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Then listen to the sound again.
