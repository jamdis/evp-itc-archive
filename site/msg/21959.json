I was hearing all this stuff about it being the doomsday comet,\n&gt; &gt; so I actaully(yeah I know, not believable) went out and looked at it, and\n&gt; &gt; saw it as nothing a few weeks ago. Then all these proclamations of what a\n&gt; &gt; nothin&#39; it really is. I think the claims of it being distroyed are\n&gt; &gt; bogus--it&#39;s just the fake prophets trying to cover their asses. &quot;My guys&quot;\n&gt; &gt; have, and still maintain Christmas-2012. If that proves to be nothin&#39; as\n&gt; &gt; well, gonna pile the boxes up and lite them on fire! The lesson, don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; listen to internet fucktards.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; F-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; David the Spirit Tech, (if I am hearing him correctly) says, that &quot;comet,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Elenin was destroyed yesterday 8-31-11 he said it completely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disintegrated.&quot; Our good old Sun took it out so, if this is true, it&#39;s a\n&gt; &gt; true blessing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for this planet, and we should all thank God.
