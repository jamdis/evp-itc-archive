<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Everyone,

 I have been thinking about what our friends on the other side have 
been saying concerning harmony, resonance and positive vibration.
While thinking on this and how to achieve amongst us all, I had an 
idea for a new subject of research. I had been thinking about 
spiritual and harmonic energy connection between the spirit world and 
our physical world and contemplating how Mike &amp; Lisa stress the 
importance of this state in the success of better stronger 
communication.

 Then the idea of identical twins came to mind and the spiritual and 
sometimes telekinetic bonds that they have been known to share. This 
idea raised two questions in my mind. 

1. is this spiritual and mental energy bond between twins similar to 
the bond we must develop with our spirit counter parts to facilitate 
better, stronger and longer sustained communication. 

2. twins in the womb are conceived when for whatever reason one 
single egg splits into two separate eggs and those two fetuses 
develop independently of each other, but with identical DNA blue 
prints and identical physical characteristics. The question is.

Is their spirit or spiritual energy also divided equally between the 
two individuals that is existent as one spirit divided into two that 
serves as their individual spiritual energy while in the physical and 
then after death is recombined into a single spirit?

Or does the spirit at the time of fetal division become two separate 
and distinct spirits that remain as two individual spirits after 
crossing to the spirit world?

I propose a research experiment involving certain questions to our 
technicians involving this subject matter over say the course of 
three 10 minute sessions. At the end all participants will submit 
their individual responses if any and they can be compared for 
similarity or dissimilarity.

Any researchers interested in this project please let me know, I 
would like to get started within the week.
