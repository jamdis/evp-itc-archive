Keep an open mind, and test claims.  If the claim is that something catastrophic is going to happen in 2012, wait and see, then decide the reliability of the source.  If the claim is that ghosts are talking on my radio, test that claim, and then decide on the reliability of those making the claim, and those disputing it.\n\nRj\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Here&#39;s a commet BITE ME!

Every freaking culture in the world has the same damn date--but\n&gt; &gt;&gt; everyone knows they were so backward and so retarded that they could not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; possible have known anything! All they could do was plot the orbits of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; planets with unbelievable accuracy and at a time when western science still\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thought the Earth was the center of the universe and flat! These ancients\n&gt; &gt;&gt; built structures that &quot;modern&quot; science can&#39;t even comprehend, yet &quot;modern&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; scientists act like they know everything and all has been discovered. These\n&gt; &gt;&gt; scientists already know everything,. so no need to check their facts. Same\n&gt; &gt;&gt; question as always, who is paying these idiots?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  F-S\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On Fri, Mar 26, 2010 at 5:53 PM, neferkit &lt;Neferkit@verizon. net&lt;http://mc/compose?to=Neferkit@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, Zack!
