&gt; I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m hearing much in the EVPs becuase they&#x27;re so distant
&gt; sounding, but I think the photos are interesting. What were they shot with?
&gt; The one with the man walking on the right was particularly curious!

&gt; &gt; I was looking for some practice on investigating so I found an old small
&gt; &gt; cemetery. It is a couple hundred yards from the state&#x27;s largest supplier
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; crushed limestone for the last 100 years. The grass was mowed but that
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; the extent of the upkeep. Many tombstones were broken and tossed to the
&gt; &gt; outside edge of the cemetery. Many children were buried there. The oldest
&gt; &gt; tombstone we found was1815. It was 60 degrees the whole time were there.
&gt; We
&gt; &gt; were sooo cold and we could easily see our breath. I&#x27;ve never heard of
&gt; any
&gt; &gt; paranormal experiences regarding here and we&#x27;ve decided to keep
&gt; &gt; it anonymous in an attempt to preserve what is left. The photos are kind
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &quot;iffy&quot; I might be seeing things where there isn&#x27;t anything. I&#x27;d
&gt; appreciate
&gt; &gt; any feedback.
