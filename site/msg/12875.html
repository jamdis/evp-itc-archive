I would like to be allowed to respond to mike colletta in a professi=

Bruce,

I almost decided to let you do that but then I thought about it=
. I also 
remembered past issues. It's fine if you want to respond. In fact=
 I 
think I have no right to deny you to do that. However I do have a right=
 
to keep you guys from duking it out HERE in this forum. It has been 
disr=
upted enough with the petty arguments. So find another place to 
have your =
word wars because most of the members here are NOT involved 
and should not=
 be subjected to such displays of ego.

I'm sorry but I have to deny your r=
equest for membership again. 
Normally I would email this to you personally=
 but I want everyone here 
to know that this type of behavior is no longer =
tolerated. I just do 
not have time to be referee to peoples personal squab=
bles. So if you 
are here to research and learn then no problem. That is wh=
at this forum 
is for. If you are here just to be a negative influence then=
 please 
take it somewhere else. This forum is not a battle ground. 
______=

Mike, 

I understand why the conflict made you want to post her=
e but again this 
is not the place for it. As I stated before most of the m=
embers here 
are not involved in this conflict and shouldnt have to be subj=
ected to 
two grown men duking it out over something that they had no part =
in or 
even knew about. Most are here to learn and share and move forward. =

____________ ____
Everyone Else,
Up til now this has been a free posting f=
orum and nobody has been 
moderated. However that could change so please re=
think your actions 
before posting here. 

So post it on your websites, sta=
rt your own forums with your own rules 
that allow someone to be "victoriou=

either side and having said that I wish =
you all well in your research. 

Misty
