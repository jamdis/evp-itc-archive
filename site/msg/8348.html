<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Stefan,
I record EVP maker at 75% speed setting. I record direct to the 
computer with a Soundblaser Audigy card set to +3 octave to bring the 
pitch back, this is why it sounds a bit &#x27;off&#x27;. The &quot;Ohhh Yes&quot; clip is 
just how it was recorded, I find it most unusual. I&#x27;ll try more 
testing tonight, it&#x27;s been exciting.

&gt; Hi Dave,
&gt; 
&gt; the &quot;Ohhhh yes&quot; file is of course absolutely clear. Did you slow it
&gt; down? It sounds so &quot;stretched&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; From &quot;You hear the people&quot;, I can&#x27;t hear the &quot;peo&quot; from &quot;people&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; And from &quot;The [peo]ple u[se the] test, you should [tape]..error&quot;, I
&gt; can&#x27;t hear the parts between brackets.
&gt; 
&gt; But that doesn&#x27;t mean anything, since we all have a different 
hearing,
&gt; and EVP are primarily for the person who gets them.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Stefan,
&gt; &gt;  I tried your idea last night using your file and instructions 
and got some results. Most messages were two or maybe three words, 
only a couple were longer with any meaning. I&#x27;ll post a few here as
&gt; &gt; an example.
&gt; &gt; &quot;Ohh Yes&quot;
&gt; &gt; &quot;You hear the people&quot;
&gt; &gt; &quot;The people use the test, you should tape..error&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks for the excellent tip, this method appears to have great 
potential,
&gt; &gt; Dave

&gt; &gt; Hi Misty, &quot;inner energy&quot;, all,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; maybe one could feed the SpeakJet allophones into EVPmaker. The 
attached
&gt; &gt; WAV file contains the 72 allophones of the SpeakJet chip. (I used
&gt; &gt; Audition to cut them out of the sample clip which has been posted 
here
&gt; &gt; recently, and store them in a cue list.) To use this file as an 
EVPmaker
&gt; &gt; source, the &quot;Use Cue List&quot; option must be checked. I have done a 
few short
&gt; &gt; sessions, and got this strange message:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;                 &quot;I little Sir help you eclipse.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; (Doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me... lol)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Of course, this cannot replace a hardware version of SpeakJet, 
since
&gt; &gt; EVPmaker isn&#x27;t able to produce the proper transitions between the
&gt; &gt; allophones. But maybe it&#x27;s worth a try...
&gt;
