Hey,
I am having an unbelievable time with fried equipment. Now my sound is blown! No speakers or headphones work. I heard a pop and then(silence is not always golden for us evp types!) I have been through alot of hardware this month! Thats not mentioning screwed up software, digital recorders and sound files and emails that just seem to go missing! I hear from other researchers that this is not uncommon.Im losing stuff quickly. Ill be outta business before long! Is there a safeguard for this? Anyone had these things happen to them?
Ive wondered if emf protection might be in order...I hope I dont sound completely madd!(besides, its the Madd Hatter thats got that covered. Im actually more like Alice...clueless! So...SOS!
in other words...
HELP!
