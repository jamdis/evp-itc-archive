Hey there Rasterer,

Just going on the things I have read on the net about =
remote viewing, and the 
practitioners I have spoken too, could I politley =
suggest that you use a none 
electronic field generating object to place yo=
ur target on, as from what I can 
gather, objects of this type make it diff=
icult to 'see' the target. I know that 
this counts for people doing rv wor=
k, I guess it could make it difficult for a 
box to 'see' also?

Kind regar=
ds

Qwee Qweg

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Experiment 3

  

This experiment is intended for th=
ose interested in exploring the Remote Viewing 
capabilities of their Ghost=
 Box's, EVP recorders. or even personal clairvoyant 
or precognitive capabi=
lities  And to maybe even have a little fun here.

On Friday, 7/30/2010 I p=
laced an object on top of my computer monitor, right in 
front of me, and w=
ill leave it there until noon Denver time on Monday, 8/2/2010.   
This expe=
riment asks for participants to determine what that object is. Vague or 
pa=
rtial answers won't be counted (for example, just giving a color, shape, si=
ze,  
what it's made of, etc): we're looking for what it is. Answers anyone=
 reveals 
after noon Denver time Monday won't count.  Participants can use =
their ghost 
boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means they chose.  At the e=
nd of the 
experiment, I will reveal the object, and a tally of the number =
of correct 
and/or incorrect answers.

In order to keep me honest, I have t=
aken a picture of the object at the start of 
the experiment and loaded it =
to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group.  
The idea with this file i=
s that you can download it now and 'keep it safe' on 
your computer. Then a=
t the end of the experiment, I will post the password so 
you can reveal th=
e contents of the file. That way, you were in control of the 
original imag=
e during the entire test, not me. 


Password pdf: http://tech.groups.yahoo=
.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100730.pdf

And if you do not care to downl=
oad the pdf file now, I will post the final image 
there at the end of the =
experiment anyway.

My monitor is one of the older box-like SONY CRTs, and =
says "Trinitron" and  
"Multiscan 200sf" on the upper front.   I have a cou=
ple monitors stacked in my 
closet too: they are not the monitors used in t=
his experiment (they are not 
plugged in, and have nothing else on them any=
way), and I have several laptops 
around: they are also not the monitors in=
 this experiment.  The monitor in this 
experiment is the only SONY monitor=
 I have, says "SONY in various places on it, 
and can be seen in the follow=
ing link from the first experiment, when the 
correct answer would have bee=
n "radio":

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710=
.1.JPG

Please post all answers to the group thread: that way, there will b=
e a public 
record and I won't get accused of losing any answers. Any answe=
rs sent directly 
to me, I will repost on the public thread.
