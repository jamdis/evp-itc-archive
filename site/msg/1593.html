Hi Bruce,

 

Nobody is ostracized here, I think you=92ve mistaken this gro=
up for some of
the others you=92ve participated in. That=92s part of

the r=
eason why we=92re here. This group is about trying different things.

 

Ye=
s, I hear your view on the easily recognizable names. There may be other
pe=
ople out there who agree with you, but that=92s as 

far as it goes. Can=92=
t change or influence someone else=92s opinion. Best we
can do is to focus =
on the positive fact that we=92re communicating

with spirit, regardless of=
 who it is.

 

Welcome to the group,

Keith

 my theory of evp

 

Theory of evp

These are my thoughts on why we get cl=
ass A or class B or lower, why 
some evps stand on their own and some have =
to be edited by an audio 
editing program to be heard. I am sure that all s=
erious evp 
researchers do recording sessions in their homes more than anyw=
here 
else such as on a field investigation. If your like me you do a 
reco=
rding just about everyday. In my experience there are many 
different types=
 of evp researchers you have your die hard white noise 
users, your silent =
no question no background noise individuals your 
only on investigations or=
 in ascertain room of the house people and 
the radicals that reach out for=
 new methods and ideas and are always 
experimenting with different ways to=
 record evp and dedicating a lot 
of brain power to try and come up with a =
way to make the break 
through to real time communication as apposed to rec=
ording a question 
and answer session to be analyzed later.
Then you have t=
he researchers like me that embrace with an open mind 
all forms of evp as =
well as itc and any other form of paranormal 
research and investigation, s=
ee I am the type of PI that will try new 
methods and post them to a forum =
or on my website so that others may 
see what I am working on and maybe giv=
e it a try themselves and 
hopefully further the method and the knowledge o=
f it. Only to come 
under fire from the so called sceptics that believe the=
y must at any 
cost negatively view any presented outcome to give themselve=
s 
credibility. 
Anyway this is turning into a rant and getting away from t=
he subject. 
Many evp researchers if not all that I see and read and have c=
ontact 
with are under the assumption that, and don't get me wrong they may=
 
be 100% correct that all evp are formed the same way with the spirit 
usi=
ng whatever form of ambient energy is available to form a message 
whether =
it be artificially supplied by the researcher or natural such 
as emf energ=
y.
I do subscribe to this theory that spirits do need some sort of 
energy =
to form words and place them onto our recording medium, that 
is not my dis=
pute.
I also believe that the majority of researchers believe an evp is an =

evp and the only valid evp is the one that can be heard loudly and 
clearl=
y from the raw recording, I do not believe in this ideology. I 
believe the=
re are two distinct and different ways we receive evp one 
from the physica=
l plane and one from the spiritual plane. I believe 
that the only way to r=
eceive what has been classified as a class A 
evp is from an earthbound or =
grounded spirit that is actually 
haunting a location and is capable of uti=
lizing the energy in the 
location much more efficiently for the reason tha=
t the spirit is 
among the investigator and can take advantage of the close=
 proximity 
to the recording device and feed off of the physical and ambien=
t 
energy supplied by the individual or individuals in the recording 
area.=
 I also suspect that at times if we are lucky enough to be doing 
a recordi=
ng at the right time we can record a class A evp from a 
spirit that is not=
 grounded but in visitation at that time.
But the class A & B++ evps must b=
e obtained from a spirit that is 
occupying the same area as the recording =
device.
the second type of evp is the spiritual plane evp, messages recorde=
d 
from spirits that have crossed over and are in the spiritual world, I 
b=
elieve they are still capable of sending evp messages from the 
spirit worl=
d only they must also use the ambient energy surrounding 
the recorder or c=
ompile it and place it onto the recorder. In other 
words a much harder and=
 less effective method for the spirit leaving 
the message. Therefore the m=
essages we receive in this manner are 
often weak quiet and a bit distorted=
 but they are there.
If we take the time to look for them and clean them up=
 most of them 
are understandable also the majority of these messages tend =
to be of 
a personal nature most likely from friends or loved ones that hav=
e 
crossed. The only thing that stops these messages from being 
discovered=
 is that almost all the paranormal community subscribes to 
the idea that t=
he only valid evp is the class A evp that does not 
need to be cleaned or e=
nhanced in any way.
There are many evp researchers out there I'm sure that =
have started 
and adhered to the method of evp capture that they first lear=
ned 
about in a book or on the Internet and have not for lack of 
informati=
on or the opportunity to learn how to edit a recording using 
an audio edit=
ing program stuck to the strict set of recording 
techniques that are mostl=
y explained on the net in one form or 
another. And I also believe that the=
y witness the systematic 
slaughter of anyone who dares to post or mention =
any new or radical 
idea or form of evp capture so they shy away from takin=
g the leap and 
trying some new or seldom recognized method and stick to th=
e "OLD" 
and most widely accepted method out of fear of being ostracised 
a=
mo9ng their paranormal peers and I do mean peers , No one in this 
field is=
 any better than the next person there are only PI's with 
more experience =
and ones with less but some with the more experience 
go through the motion=
s of investigation with blinders on following an 
antiquated set of investi=
gatory and research rules and not opening 
their minds to anything else.
My=
 theory of the two different types of evp is formed from my 
personal exper=
ience with different methods of recording and capture 
and I have evps that=
 are very personal in nature mentioning my name 
as well as subject matter =
unique to me and my family that would have 
been totally over looked if not=
 for a good editing session.
NO one can make me believe especially the so c=
alled seasoned veterans 
that an evp that mentions my name and that of frie=
nds and or loved 
ones can be randomly put together from editing filters be=
ing used on 
raw static.
Well those are my thought on evp please do not hes=
itate to let me 
know what you think of this theory.

ame area as the recording device.<br>
the second type of evp is the spiritu=
al plane evp, messages recorded <br>
from spirits that have crossed over an=
d are in the spiritual world, I <br>
believe they are still capable of send=
ing evp messages from the <br>
spirit world only they must also use the amb=
ient energy surrounding <br>
the recorder or compile it and place it onto t=
he recorder. In other <br>
words a much harder and less effective method fo=
r the spirit leaving <br>
the message. Therefore the messages we receive in=
 this manner are <br>
often weak quiet and a bit distorted but they are the=
re.<br>
If we take the time to look for them and clean them up most of them=
 <br>
are understandable also the majority of these messages tend to be of =
<br>
a personal nature most likely from friends or loved ones that have <br=
>
crossed. The only thing that stops these messages from being <br>
discove=
red is that almost all the paranormal community subscribes to <br>
the idea=
 that the only valid evp is the class A evp that does not <br>
need to be c=
leaned or enhanced in any way.<br>
There are many evp researchers out there=
 I'm sure that have started <br>
and adhered to the method of evp capture t=
hat they first learned <br>
about in a book or on the Internet and have not=
 for lack of <br>
information or the opportunity to learn how to edit a rec=
ording using <br>
an audio editing program stuck to the strict set of recor=
ding <br>
techniques that are mostly explained on the net in one form or <b=
r>
another. And I also believe that they witness the systematic <br>
slaugh=
ter of anyone who dares to post or mention any new or radical <br>
idea or =
form of evp capture so they shy away from taking the leap and <br>
trying s=
ome new or seldom recognized method and stick to the "OLD" <br>
a=
nd most widely accepted method out of fear of being ostracised <br>
amo9ng =
their paranormal peers and I do mean peers , No one in this <br>
field is a=
ny better than the next person there are only PI's with <br>
more experienc=
e and ones with less but some with the more experience <br>
go through the =
motions of investigation with blinders on following an <br>
antiquated set =
of investigatory and research rules and not opening <br>
their minds to any=
thing else.<br>
My theory of the two different types of evp is formed from =
my <br>
personal experience with different methods of recording and capture=
 <br>
and I have evps that are very personal in nature mentioning my name <=
br>
as well as subject matter unique to me and my family that would have <b=
r>
been totally over looked if not for a good editing session.<br>
NO one c=
an make me believe especially the so called seasoned veterans <br>
that an =
evp that mentions my name and that of friends and or loved <br>
ones can be=
 randomly put together from editing filters being used on <br>
raw static.<=
br>
Well those are my thought on evp please do not hesitate to let me <br>
=
know what you think of this theory.<br>
