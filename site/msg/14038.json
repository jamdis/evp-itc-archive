One of  her grandson&#39;s put them all on the more mondern tape&#39;s I think, I \nrarely ever  hear from them, the son is up in age now, as is his wife, and \nI think I am the  only one still on this side that went to that Church, wish \nI could find a  kindred soul, doesn&#39;t seem to be anyone left.

She was  in her mid 80&#39;s when she crossed, she was top in her \ngifts.  If  you guys can bring her in you will get Angels as well, so keep \nthat in  mind, and when they come through, any &quot;dark forces&quot; will vanish, I \ncan  guarantee that so,  see if you can bring her through.  We  were told by \nspirit there would (one day be something that could be  worn on the wrist \nor carried, where people will be able to talk with  their loved ones on the \nother side.) we were given a time frame of 25  years or so for people to \nstart to develop this, it would be a time of  &quot;cell&quot; back then there were no \ncomputers, or even having them.
