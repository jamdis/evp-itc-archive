Hey Everyone. I love this group and I have for a LONG time! I'=

u.
You can ask Steve Brooks at the Magic Cafe about the names they called h=
im before he banned them. It started just like this.
I LOVE EVP's and I've =
been interested in them for YEARS !!!!!!
I've never said anything bad about=
 Frank or anyone who is doing research.
Please ask yourself Misty ... Where=
 did all these new characters come from and why are they already name calli=
ng etc.?
They are here for the sole purpose to disrupt this group. I'm sad =
to see it.
