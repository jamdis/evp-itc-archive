  Did you read the article? He was perform=

 Carradine Death Was Accidental

      IMDb, June 4, 2009

      David Carr=
adine died during a sex game that went wrong, according to sources in Bangk=
ok, Thailand, where he was found dead on Thursday.

      Carradine's body =
was discovered in a hotel suite and local reports suggested he committed su=
icide. 

      He was discovered by a maid, naked and hanged, but the sugge=
stions his death had a sexual twist were strongly disputed by the star's cl=
ose friend, attorney Vicki Roberts, and his manager Chuck Binder, who insis=
ted he died of natural causes. 

      But a statement from Carradine's rep=
resentative now indicates the actor died during a sex act.

      The spoke=
sperson tells TMZ.com, "We can confirm 100 percent that he never would have=
 committed suicide. It was an accidental death. Everybody is in shock." 

 =
     Rumours Carradine died attempting auto-erotic asphyxiation--where vict=
ims achieve heightened sexual pleasure by restricting their air supply are =
backed up by a quote a Bangkok police officer gave to British newspaper The=
 Sun. 

      The cop tells reporters, "A rope was attached to his neck and=
 also to his penis". 

      Rocker Michael Hutchence was rumoured to have =
died attempting the same sex act in a Sydney, Australia, hotel room back in=
 1997--although his death was officially declared a suicide.

      Carradi=
ne was in Thailand to shoot the movie "Stretch." He was 72.
