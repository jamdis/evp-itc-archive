To be honest, I am still very skeptical about the Frank's Box type of techn=
ology, as I have not heard anything convincing enough for me personally to =
say yeah-that is spirit communication. But I do remain open to the possibil=
ity.

But that is my problem not anyone else's, and this is why I have refr=
ained from commenting too much on anyone's results.

    I think it varies depending on who you ask as well as what they hav=
e personally experienced. As an example, some people believe in angels and =
demons others do not. Therefor some may get messages that correspond to the=
ir own beliefs as well as the beliefs of those who are speaking.

  Almost =
every person who does this eventually develops a theory that may change ove=
r time based on what they experience and what their beliefs are. Then there=
 are those who remain undecided or have doubts.

  As for me I look at it a=
s purely educational, a learning experience. Ive met many people I never kn=
ew existed. Ive researched topics I'd never even considered. Ive gotten mes=
sages and images that are awe inspiring and many interesting concepts to po=
nder and explore.

  There are many glimpses of truth, as well as momentary=
 proof along the way that lead me to develop my own theory and eventually y=
ou will develop your own too. This research is fascinating and can be quite=
 mind blowing.

  I dont worry what anyone else thinks. I have no need to p=
rove anything to anyone else. They can do that for themselves. I always say=
 honesty is the best policy and if you are honest with yourself and others =
the only ones who object are those who's lies arent tolerated. So just look=
 for the truth yourself and dont let me or anyone else tell you what that i=
s. 

  It's a great journey and your path is your own!
