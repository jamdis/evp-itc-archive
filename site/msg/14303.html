James, Unfortunately I didn't hear what you are hearing in these either. My=
 results are pretty much the same as Ricks. In a few instances, I could hea=
r something, but not sure what it was, not even sure if it was a voice or j=
ust a noise or artifact from too much "enhancing".

I am not going to say t=
hat you definitely don't have anything in your recordings, but I can't say =
you have anything either.

  I opened your folder =
and examined all your files.

  Here are my opinions (I have truncated the =
file names due to laziness):

  ahh_mmm noises, no speech
  call_us noises,=
 no speech
  cal_us (enhanced) several listenings: pixelated, no speech
  c=
ompare_panasonic noises, no speech
  compare_sony noises, no speech
  first=
_epv noises, no speech
  good_whistle noises, no speech (maybe feedback)
  =
hey_can noises, no speech
  hey_whats noises, no speech
  I_hit noises, no =
speech
  important_date noises, no speech
  keep_moving several listenings:=
 Hellalal see woobeh 
  laugh_evp noises, no speech
  lets_wait several lis=
tenings: noises, no speech
  maybe_gun noises, no speech
  miss_you noises,=
 no speech
  my_question several listenings: no da lee
  oh_ noises, no spe=
ech
  something several listenings: noises, no speech
  that_mans noises, n=
o speech
  that's_jim noises, no speech
  this_one several listenings: nois=
es, no speech
  tomorrow noises, no speech

  The ones that took several li=
stenings I thought I might hear words in, so I examined those several times=
. Sometimes I could sort of hear something that sort of sounded like what y=
ou suggested, but I could also hear it in other ways, or not at all.

  So =
my suggestion to you, if you want to get less subjective conjuctures or sim=
ply less affirmations of your own interpretations, is to post the future on=
es without labels. The labels you give can influence the listeners: when yo=
u have a sound that could be several things, and you note that it sounded l=
ike "keep it moving", the listener can find it nearly impossible to try NOT=
 to hear what you heard, and so not be able to give a fresh perspecive to h=
elp your research methods.
