<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Rod-- I think you&#x27;ve missed out, buddy. I&#x27;ve had loving relationships  
with spirit entities for decades. Too bad one never came your way. It  
might make you feel differently about blanket statements like &quot;&#x27;being  
a friend&#x27; is not on their list of priorities! That goes for all of  
them.&quot; My own three decades of involvement with contact with the  
Other Side--and I have also been ghost hunting many years before it  
became a fad--that they are fully capable of loving interaction, and  
do so on a regular basis if they so choose.

&gt; Bruce,  the boxes aside,  I am talking about Ghosts, period.  The  
&gt; boxes are for simple communication,  not inter-acting.  When I say  
&gt; &quot;inter-acting&quot; I don&#x27;t mean trade a few words,  I&#x27;m referring to  
&gt; Meaningful interaction.  Making a Statement,  passing on a message  
&gt; to me or a living relative,  predicting or causing &quot;physical&quot;  
&gt; inferances.   I&#x27;ve experienced every kind of Ghost,  I feel  
&gt; certain,  all over the world.  I have experience with them that  
&gt; most people just dream about...or fear.  I have been carressed,   
&gt; molested,  poked,  probed,  slapped,  punched,  knocked down and  
&gt; physically Picked Up by a Ghost.  I have confronted them face-to- 
&gt; face while they were both visible and invisable.  I have numerous  
&gt; times held conversations with them via voice recorder and once even  
&gt; one-on-one (it was the experience of a life-time!).  I was Hunting  
&gt; Ghosts many, many years before it became a fad,  or cool to do so.   
&gt; And,  believe me,  I am far from being an &quot;expert&quot;.  I do not  
&gt; presume on Ghosts or their personalities.  Every time in the past  
&gt; that I&#x27;ve done so,  I&#x27;ve been rocked back on my heels,   
&gt; psychologically speaking. Some are good,  some are not.  Many of  
&gt; them very much enjoy making you the fool (that&#x27;s a lot easier done  
&gt; with some people than are others!) .
&gt; It doesn&#x27;t matter in the slightest what you Think of them,  They  
&gt; are what they are,  and &quot;being a friend&quot; is definitely not on their  
&gt; list of priorities!  That goes for All of them.  They will play  
&gt; with you.  They will lie to you.  They will tell, or imply to you,  
&gt; what they know you want to hear,  that or they will laugh at you.   
&gt; I have personally heard their laughter,  on more than one  
&gt; occasion.  The first step in beginning to understand Ghosts is to  
&gt; quit watching stupid TV Ghost Dramas,  and learn to be discernful  
&gt; aboutReality.  God bless, anyway.        --Rod

&gt; Rod,
&gt;
&gt; No disrespect but how do you know what ghosts have
&gt; the where with all to do? I speak with them through frank and joe&#x27;s  
&gt; box on a daily basis and consider the
&gt; two that are communicating daily to be friends. I believe you are  
&gt; speaking of grounded spirits not etherals
&gt; and ghosts that are grounded most definately interact with us.  
&gt; residual ghosts and hauntings do not that is why
&gt; there is a distinction between the two intelligent and residual  
&gt; hauntings. but we are not talking generaly about
&gt; haunting spirits that communicate through frank and joe&#x27;s boxes,  
&gt; but all types of entities and don&#x27;t call anyone
&gt; dillusional unless you yourself have experienced your own research  
&gt; with the boxes.

&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] my opinion on the mini box
&gt;
&gt; I certainly agree with the point of Bruces&#x27; statement,  but I fear  
&gt; he&#x27;s being delusional about &quot;friends&quot; from the other side affecting  
&gt; some inter-action between a box and the user,  not letting one  
&gt; work,  the box chosing it&#x27;s owner,  etc., etc., etc.  In the first  
&gt; place Ghosts are Not our Friends!  That&#x27;s pure, unadulterated Fantasy.
&gt; The Ghosts do not have the where-with-all to accomplish this in the  
&gt; first place, and even if they did they don&#x27;t give a rats&#x27; rear end  
&gt; what a Ghost Hunter does or doesn&#x27;t do.  That boy really needs to  
&gt; get real.  Ghosts simply do not re-act to the living in that way,  
&gt; or much of any other way except to allow us to see or hear them and  
&gt; then only when they want it to happen.  Their most obvious and  
&gt; biggest trait is to be totally indifferent to our wishes.   Over 40  
&gt; yrs. of Investigating the Paranormal has taught me nothing if it  
&gt; hasn&#x27;t taught me this.      --Rod

&gt; since I dropped the bomb about this mini box to Frank s. yesterday I
&gt; did not expect such a fervent hoopla about it.So I will give my box
&gt; experienced opinion after lengthy research with both Frank&#x27;s and
&gt; Joe&#x27;s boxes. I have contacted the manufacturer for an explanation, he
&gt; instructed me to listen to the audio file and view the demo video on
&gt; his site. After doing so my opinion on this box and the builders
&gt; intentions for it is.
&gt;
&gt; The box itself is not a knock off of Frank&#x27;s box but a cheap and
&gt; ineffective version of Joe&#x27;s box,It works on an AM band instead of an
&gt; FM band as Joe&#x27;s box does. Another big difference is Joe&#x27;s box
&gt; actually works and you have all heard the files I have posted from
&gt; sessions with it. After listening to this box and seeing it in
&gt; operation I feel that anyone who purchases this box will be very
&gt; disappointed and will not receive any contact from it and even if
&gt; they did they probably would not even realise it for the simple fact
&gt; that you have to have a certain amount of experience with box
&gt; research and operation before developing an ear for picking up real
&gt; time communication and also creating a bond with the spirit friends
&gt; on the other side and also a measure of trust on both sides.
&gt;
&gt; I believe the manufacturer to be a capitalist and only interested in
&gt; the monetary reward to be gained from offering this cheap and
&gt; ineffective copy to unsuspecting and naive individuals who are
&gt; interested in this medium. I do not like to bad mouth anyone, it
&gt; usually comes back to bite you in the ass but I believe that our
&gt; friends on the other side know of our intentions and would not allow
&gt; someone with the wrong intentions to develop a working tool for
&gt; communication. also I believe that a person does not pick the box the
&gt; box picks the person.
&gt;
&gt; So let him have his short and lucrative run with this fooling
&gt; unsuspecting clients, bad karma always comes home.
