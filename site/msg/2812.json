People all over the worl=\r\nd scream for proof but yet if you ask them they cannot define what criteria=\r\n they require for proof. Why? Because they are so brainwashed in our societ=\r\nies materialistic teachings they never expect to receive proof, so they don=\r\n&#39;t even bother to define such a criteria.\n\n  Its amazing to me that a prima=\r\nrily spiritual creature such as ourselves can deny our connections with tha=\r\nt world and the source. The connections we experience everyday and at all t=\r\nimes in the form of dreams, random thoughts and inspirations are so easily =\r\ntaken for granted and written off as figments of imagination, trivial thoug=\r\nhts and meaningless aspirations. Even as a child I knew I was unique as was=\r\n every person on the face of the planet. I knew that their were as many per=\r\nspectives of reality as their were people to have them and that each and ev=\r\nery one of them were just as valid as the other no matter how outlandish it=\r\n seemed to me.\n\n  Acceptance was taught to me instead of beliefs. Beliefs c=\r\nan enhance the truth but they are not in themselves true.\n\n  More than I ex=\r\npected to write but I feel it is still valid,\n\n  Best regards,\n\n  Frank R.\n=\r\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----\n  From: Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@hotmai=\r\nl.com&gt;\n  To: evp-itc@yahoogroups.com\n  Sent: Monday, November 5, 2007 1:03:=\r\n02 PM\n  Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] Nothin&#39;!\n\n\n   I&#39;m not really discouraged exc=\r\nept by other people&#39;s expectation, and use of the box.
