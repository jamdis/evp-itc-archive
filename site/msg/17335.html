<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I haven&#x27;t banned anyone--yet, cuz I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s fair, But there are the
few people that can&#x27;t hear anything, don&#x27;t do any &quot;research&quot;, then tell
others what the voices, and the rest of the paranormal really is are
insulting, disruptive, and is not what this group is for. There are plenty
of groups catering to the sekptic, we don&#x27;t need that crap here.

&gt; You know its kind of humorous for me that those who have the desire to
&gt; &quot;discuss&quot; thier different views are often the ones who do the least amount
&gt; of actual research... as long as you have been in this group not once have
&gt; you shared one evp. If you did then please refresh my memory. This seems to
&gt; more about commenting on what others share for you than it is about doing
&gt; any research yourself. Im not sure what you are looking for, if you are here
&gt; to learn, correspond, or if you are just here to get a rise out of others
&gt; but to be honest I do not have time for it.
&gt;
&gt; Whether Frank bans anyone or not is up to him entirely. But I have warned
&gt; you before and I am saying it again. Cut the crap and move on. That goes for
&gt; ALL of you. I dont mind discussions, I dont mind differences of opinion but
&gt; I do mind BS.
&gt;
&gt; If you have research to share then do so, if your research yeilds no
&gt; results then state it as such. If your only purpose for being in this group
&gt; is to question others, disect them, and cause negative discussions then
&gt; perhaps you are wasting your time here. You are definitely wasting mine.
