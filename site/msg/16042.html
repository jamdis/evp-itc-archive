OMG!!! This is why I don't listen to many of these programs.

By far, my la=
rgest pet peeve is misinformation.

  Art Bell was filling in, and he had a guest that supposedly worked with S=
piricom. The bottom line was the guy thought Spiricom was faked and he used=
 that as a way of implying all EVP was faked, at least that's the way I too=
k it, and he connected the boxes to Spiricom, implying they also did not wo=
rk. Not only that, it was implied that if one speaks to the dead, one goes =
insane! I was out raged! As usual though Art Bell, and C2C never answer e-m=
ails, and continue to act like they are the last word on anything paranorma=
l, turning into more of debunking agency than anything informative. The thi=
nking of the listeners, I think, is being carefully guided and manipulated.=
 Radio remains only good for a source of raw audio, and not any meaningful =
information or dialog. 

  These "researchers"/debunkers never check any fa=
cts, never check with anyone that makes or uses the equipment, they just pa=
ss their opinions off as facts. If they actuyally honelstly tested this tec=
hnology they would be singing a different tune, but I supposed they are not=
 paid to be honest.
