<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for the analysis, Misty. It was one of strangest things I have 
caught on EVP. We also had a wireless microphone in the room which did 
not pick up the &quot;whisper&quot;. So it was definitely centered on the 
digital voice recorder, which was sitting on a dresser during that 
particular time.

&gt; Rob,
&gt; 
&gt; Not sure but I definitely hear a whispery voice behind the person 
speaking. Not sure what they say there tho it could even be your name 
LOL

&gt; rob rob
&gt; drop drop
&gt; fu** up
&gt; 
&gt; Cant tell because of the speech level of the voice tho it does sound 
to be close in proximity to the mic.

&gt; &gt; I am new to the group and have an EVP I want an opinion on.
&gt; &gt; The file is 
&gt; &gt; posted on the folder ROB STONE&#x27;S FILES. Not sure what
&gt; &gt; the &quot;voice&quot; is.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If anyone has time to take a listen I would greatly
&gt; &gt; appreciate it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks for your help.
