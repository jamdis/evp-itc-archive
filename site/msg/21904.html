<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I say lets see what a judge says. Any legal action over something on the internet highly unlikely. Besides, you could counter sue and win for harrassment. I&#x27;ve gotten threats like that before from people that charge big bucks for box access. Same old stupid ego crap I have heard/read from alot of these so called paranormal investigastors, most are fakes frauds and con men. 

 If you read my posts you&#x27;ll know I think these so called  &quot;investigations&quot; are a complete waste of time since 90% of the evidence is based on seggestion, and you can create the phenomenon you want to experience. I don&#x27;t do investigations, and don&#x27;t go to haunted hot spots to get EVPS. &quot;They&quot; will come to you, spirits and entities are everywhere, they travel it&#x27;s not dangerous, and there are no portals. Most do these ghost hunts for a fear rush. Why else would ya do this crap in the dark--so ya can sneak up on ghost? 

 BTW, my grandson plays with boxes-he&#x27;s 10--no harm, no threats, no demons, no portals, no Chuckie dolls running around the house....

 Yeah, I know, might as well tell it to my dogs!

&gt; I have a legal question that I cannot seem to find an answer to. I recently
&gt; went on an investigation to a public place with a  paranormal group. While
&gt; my experience is much less than theirs, I found them to be too disorganized.
&gt; Three people came from the group. One had no equipment and the second used
&gt; his cell phone. I never even saw a pencil. So, I started a small group,
&gt; specifically for amateur investigators staying in local public places so we
&gt; don&#x27;t get in over our heads. We aren&#x27;t trying to get any resident
&gt; investigations and are non competitive. On our site I put photos and evps I
&gt; had gotten while on the investigation and put at the bottom that some
&gt; evidence was obtained while on investigations with other groups. I didn&#x27;t
&gt; use any of their names. As with any of my photos, I blocked out any faces,
&gt; and it was all on my equipment. I signed nothing and agreed to nothing.
&gt; Yesterday he sent me an email saying he wants it taken down. It&#x27;s
&gt; technically and legally his ( technically and legally?). If I wanted to
&gt; start my own group all I had to do was ask. He has said that I invited a 16
&gt; year old to join the group (Definitely didn&#x27;t). And that he thought I would
&gt; join their group.
&gt; -I don&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s right on the legal issue. Ethically, I would have
&gt; accredited the group if he was more diplomatic and maybe even taken it down.
&gt; 
&gt; - wouldn&#x27;t making false accusations make him guilty of liable?
&gt; - I don&#x27;t need to ask him to do ****. I&#x27;ve met him twice.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anybody know of any place where I can find something written on the law
&gt; about those photos and media being mine.
