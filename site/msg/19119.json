A physicist at MIT is building a\nspecialized machine which is basically the most accurate clock (measuring\ntime by splitting laser beams) which will allow the light of the laser beam\nover microseconds to be blown up and analyzed to see if time distorts.  I\ncan&#39;t wait to read the results!  So yeah, it is possible that &quot;life is but a\ndream.&quot;\n\nTim\n\nOn Wed, Oct 27, 2010 at 2:27 AM, Frank Sumption\n&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  [Attachment(s) &lt;#12bec6738a5579e5_TopText&gt; from Frank Sumption included\n&gt; below]\n&gt;\n&gt; And that explains all this impossible stuff, all dream.\n&gt;\n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI hea \"You' e on o some hing........\"  Really ha d o unde s and his one.The e was an a icle in Popula Science ecen ly ha alked abou he idea ha all we see, ou 3d wo ld, is a holog aphic p ojec ion; a alse eali y based upon space ime dis o ion.  A physicis a MIT is building a specialized machine which is basically he mos accu a e clock (measu ing ime by spli ing lase beams) which will allow he ligh o he lase beam o e mic oseconds o be blown up and analyzed o see i ime dis o s.  I can' wai o ead he esul s!  So yeah, i is possible ha \"li e is bu a d eam.\"\nTimOn Wed, Oc 27, 2010 a 2:27 AM, F ank Sump ion pu plealiengi l@...> w o e:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n [A achmen (s) om F ank Sump ion included below]\n \n \n And ha explains all his impossible s u , all d eam. \n \n F-S"}
