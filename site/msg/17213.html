Ive cut the VT wire and the MUTE wire in the 820. Maybe I'm on the wrong si=
de of the board then. I now have (2) 820's but want to leave one untouched =
as far as adding the sweep circuit. I'll have to poke around and see what I=
 can find. I assume the radio board is the side that faces me when I open t=
he back cover off of it. The pin I'm trying to tap into might not even be r=
ight. Its the pin just under 217 on the board. I can hear the sweep pumping=
, but the channel doesnt change. I've spent twice as long trying to attach =
the circuit as I did building it. :) 
There seemed to be quite a bit in add=
ition to "earth is doomed", which I did hear. Why do you think the radio wo=
uldn't work in the box Frank? Did it work, just not prperly or did it just =
not work at all at that point?

Chris
