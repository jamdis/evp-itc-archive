I do agree in that I don't like it when people start hurling personal insul=
ts. We should all be able to conduct civil debate.

But....

Yahoo groups a=
re not democracies. They are products generated from personal opinion. If y=
ou find yourself in a group that you feel treats you unfairly, you are alwa=
ys free to unsub and join a different one.

Having said all that, I have no=
t been here very long, but long enough to observe that Frank's bark is wors=
e than his bite ;)

  Zack,

 =
 I do not meen to offend anyone but I do not think just because you are a p=
erson who started this forum that you have the rite to insult and offend pe=
ople for speaking there opinion.

  Is that not what this and other groups =
are about. someone else said the rules here are if you are insulting or mea=
n then you will be baned does that not go for every one or is it just a few=
 people can say what they want and others will be baned ?

  I said I did n=
ot meen to insult anyone but I feel there is an injustuce here and favorats=
m wich is wrong in any group.

  why is it do as i say not as i do. the rul=
es should be for everyone no matter what. if you aply this thinking to ever=
y thing we would be living in a world were people were in prison for doing =
a crime and the people in goverment could do as they please to sell drugs o=
r kill or whatever and get away with it.

  we should not have to be USED T=
O someone who can akt and insult who ever he wants too when ever he wants t=
oo.

  that is my opinion.
  pleese forgive my english.

  John

  Well, it's his group (he doesn't own it =
now but he started it) and he's the one who invented the box and builds the=
m and supplies us with all the info on them. His name is Frank Sumption.

 =
 Those of us who have been around here half of forever are used to him and =
aren't offended.
