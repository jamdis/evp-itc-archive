I have a way to put a box on a telephone line and set it\nup so it can be operated by the phones DTMF tones.  You can power it\non and off, control vol, scan rate, band, ect.  I could have it all\nrecorded and then emailed to the caller.  If I made it open to anybody\nwith a phone it might be &quot;less&quot; of an ego trip for the people involved\nin this.  I would like to hear your thoughts on this idea.\nRob.\n-- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi All;\n&gt;  I&#39;m wondering why some many that do this &quot;reseach&quot; go mash potatoes\nin the head, developing what seems to be that messiah complex. Box\nuser after box user seems to go down this road. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s\njust human ego, or they get possessed, or what. Maybe it&#39;s blinded by\ndollar signs!? Maybe it&#39;s like the Brookings Report, people just can\nnot handle the truth on a psychological/ego level. I think that report\napplies to all encounters with  the vastness of the universe. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  I can&#39;t provide boxes for anyone else until I figure this stuff\nout. It&#39;s not ethical to give people something that has the potential\nof fucking them up, to be blunt. I wanted to give these boxes out to\nsee how it worked for others, to see if they got something like I did,\nand so far it&#39;s very disappointing. It&#39;s almost like an experiment on\npeople, except most were pretty much begging for, and demanding the\nthings. Even if it&#39;s not the boxes per se`, that&#39;s even more reason to\navoid the situation. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Need to know the score, the latest news, or you need your\nHotmail-get your &quot;fix&quot;.\n&gt; http://www.msnmobilefix.com/Default.aspx\n&gt;"}
