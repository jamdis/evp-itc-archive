&gt;  One problem is the voices are often severely distorted, or made out

I&#x27;d have to say that was the major problem with the sample .wav that
April posted.  I couldn&#x27;t make out a thing he was claiming was coming
through, and it sounded a lot like a one sided conversation of Chris
talking to distortion and static.  I&#x27;m usually pretty forgiving with
sound quality, since being a musician as well I usually hear tones and
such the average person doesn&#x27;t.  But honestly, it was nowhere near
the quality or clarity of the recordings shared here on a regular basis.

Would you say that&#x27;s a problem unique to that specific box?  Since he
got it from you, and I know you tested it before you donated it to
him, do you think something happened to it since then to cause these
types of results?
