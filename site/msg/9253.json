I could probably make them a lot cheaper than they \ndo. \n&gt; The only drawback I have is that if they are double-sided boards, I \ncan&#39;t \n&gt; do plated-through holes and have to use &quot;C&quot; wires for thru-board \n&gt; connections.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, 8 Apr 2008, Frank Sumption wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I hate to ask for anything. I can afford what I need for myself. \nWhat I want to do is make some printed circuit boards that have the \nsweep, and amplifiers, then I would only have to add whatever tuner I \nwant to use to form a system, and I could make the boards available. \nI wouldn&#39;t mind putting this stuff together for others, but the \nrequests/demands are so overwhelming, there just isn&#39;t enough time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt;"}
