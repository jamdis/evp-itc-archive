I think it will be a good, informative\nshow. I was able to deliver the very first of the production\nmini-boxes to Rosemary this past Sunday while on the Queen Mary. \n\nWe spent time with all the different devices. The RadioShack Hack was\nvery surprising!! \n\nAll of this technology is fantastic. So glad to see so many minds\nworking out there to combine and create ideas.\n\nHave a great show Rosemary!!! :)"}
