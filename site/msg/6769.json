What is are the little \n    glimpses of =\r\nlife after death, in other dimensions, and seemingly all \n    around us, in=\r\nvisible.

He should \n    be free to gift hi=\r\ns boxes on whomever he feels is the one that should \n    have it--or not at=\r\n all.\n\n    Before anyone jumps on me, yes, I used to ask for a box from him=\r\n, \n    because there were no other alternatives then and because we had \n  =\r\n  known each other on several other lists for about five years and were \n  =\r\n  friends.\n\n    Bu now there are alternatives--lots of them. Buy a minibox,=\r\n like I \n    did. If that $400 price tag is too heavy, go to Radio Shack an=\r\nd make \n    a hack.
