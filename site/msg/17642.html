<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s all fascinating. It makes sense to me.

I have gotten several EVP recordings in which a name was given. In all cases
the name is not a name that was known by any of the living people present
and there is no particular reason for anyone there to be thinking of that
name. In one case the name was verified in old records as a person present
in that location many years ago (but we certainly didn&#x27;t know that at the
time we were there). In another case we&#x27;re still trying to find out if
anyone by that name was in that area within the last 150 years.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  I was listening to Tom&#x27;s very clear recording and decided to put it
&gt; through Audacity
&gt; so I could view the spectrum. Usually recordings have far too much noise
&gt; for this
&gt; to work well, which is why I like the clearer and cleaner recordings many
&gt; people
&gt; call &#x27;Class A&#x27;.  What I found got me to thinking and I want to share my
&gt; thoughts.
&gt;
&gt; First, it&#x27;s helpful to know that I have quite a bit of professional
&gt; experience studying
&gt; spectra - from ULF up through sound and light and way into the region of
&gt; radio
&gt; waves and even cosmic radiation. I have stared at more spectrum analyzers
&gt; over
&gt; the decades than I care to count. So when I realized what I was seeing in
&gt; Tom&#x27;s
&gt; recording I was a bit surprised I hadn&#x27;t thought about it before.
&gt;
&gt; Usually when you look at a visual representation of an audio recording, you
&gt; can
&gt; clearly see the noise with the signal superimposed atop it. The higher the
&gt; noise
&gt; level relative to the signal level, the lower the &#x27;signal-to-noise&#x27; ratio
&gt; which results
&gt; in recordings that are very hard to hear. In a normal recording, such as
&gt; you might
&gt; make of yourself speaking into a microphone, there is a specific way the
&gt; noise
&gt; band disappears when the signal level gets high enough. But more than that,
&gt;
&gt; this only occurs when the signal is introduced in the early stages of audio
&gt;
&gt; processing - a noisy amplifier for example looks completely different than
&gt; a high level background noise with someone speaking over it. And that&#x27;s
&gt; what is important here.
&gt;
&gt; What I noticed that got me thinking was that in the spectrum analysis,
&gt; the noise level was reasonable for this type of recording. And it was
&gt; fairly
&gt; constant. It was what I have come to see in these recordings except that
&gt; the signal to noise ratio was a bit better. Meaning the signal was a bit
&gt; clearer initially. When the sound (which seems to be a young girl&#x27;s
&gt; voice) begins, the noise level rapidly goes down and almost completely
&gt; vanishes while the signal goes high. This is why you can clearly hear
&gt; the voice: the absence of noise as much as the signal level itself.
&gt;
&gt; Now here&#x27;s what got me going. I realized that this specific waveform
&gt; suggests strongly that the point of influence is not deep inside the
&gt; electronics. Rather, it is at an exterior point, such as where the signal
&gt; first enters the system. And that would imply that something towards
&gt; the outer part of the electronics is being manipulated, and not the
&gt; recording media or anything near it.
&gt;
&gt; This would also explain why voice phenomena can appear on different
&gt; media and on different electronics such as transistor or solid state or
&gt; vacuum tube. AAEVP has suggested, and based on this observation
&gt; I would agree, that the probable point of influence is a junction near
&gt; the a front-end stage of an early amplifier circuit. Every electronic
&gt; system would have this in common.
&gt;
&gt; I have suggested before that I believe that at least some (probably
&gt; the higher quality) EVPs may be due to operator PK influence.
&gt; MicroPK is believed to operate at or near the molecular level as
&gt; evidenced by things such as healing. And healing agents have
&gt; been identified who have many similar traits to PK agents. So
&gt; it follows they may employ similar abilities and use similar
&gt; mechanisms.  This observation is entirely in line with this idea.
&gt;
&gt; Does this mean that in truth no discarnates are communicating?
&gt; In a dramatic demonstration of who I really am, or more to the
&gt; point what I really believe, let me say that I&#x27;m not yet sure.
&gt; Maybe they are, and maybe they are not. This evidence does
&gt; not tell us that answer.
&gt;
&gt; This is similar to work in mediumship research. We have shown
&gt; that mediums can receive information they should not know in
&gt; controlled laboratory conditions. But we don&#x27;t know scientifically
&gt; where this information comes from. Apparitional experients are
&gt; convinced they have seen or heard the dead, but apparitions of
&gt; the living are quite common as well. The more you learn about
&gt; this phenomena, the more you realize that many commoly
&gt; accepted explanations fall short when applied in general.
&gt;
&gt; As I wrote previously, the real issue is that science today
&gt; does  not have the understanding or the tools to properly
&gt; evaluate this data. Science cannot prove or disprove this
&gt; phenomena. Not today. An honest scientist (and skeptic)
&gt; will tell you this is an unknown, an anomaly. And so, as
&gt; folks here know, it comes down to belief in the absence
&gt; of any protocol or experiment to clearly demonstrate the
&gt; source of these sounds.
&gt;
&gt; But I for one feel comfortable that higher quality recordings
&gt; will help move us along, if for no other reason than we can
&gt; eliminate some variables. The analysis I mentioned can&#x27;t
&gt; be done on noisier recordings; it took a very quiet one to
&gt; be able to see this clearly. And that&#x27;s what triggered my
&gt; thoughts.
&gt;
&gt; I also noticed a tiny spike before and after the higher
&gt; quality speech. To some this might suggest an edit,
&gt; but in this case I don&#x27;t think that happened - here&#x27;s why.
&gt; You can see the signal emerging from the noise when
&gt; noise is still present and only when it achieves a certain
&gt; level is the noise suppressed. Had this been an edit,
&gt; the noise level on this close a scrutiny would have
&gt; been a bit more obvious - unless the editor got very lucky.
&gt; But in consideration of how the voice appears and
&gt; also the fact that similar low-level spikes appear
&gt; elsewhere in the recording, it would seem more likely
&gt; that the spikes are artifacts of the tuning that&#x27;s going
&gt; on or some other random events.
&gt;
&gt; Once again, this makes the case for me at least
&gt; for trying to get the highest quality possible. These
&gt; are the kinds of recordings which scientists may be
&gt; able to use sooner than later as understanding and
&gt; tools inevitably improve.
&gt;
&gt; One last thought regarding the notion of PK as an
&gt; explanation. It is very important we come to understand
&gt; PK well. Only then might it actually be used in a
&gt; practical way. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve heard or thought about
&gt; a world where you could literally turn things on and off
&gt; with your mind. Or type simply by thinking about it.
&gt; Believe it or not, one way forward to such technology
&gt; could well be through the understanding of PK. So much
&gt; of Parapsychology is actually exploring the leading edge
&gt; (some might say &#x27;bleeding&#x27; edge) of science. It shows us
&gt; where things might go and, frankly, that is one interesting
&gt; world at least for me. That&#x27;s why I have been in the field
&gt; for many decades.
&gt;
&gt; Apologies for the long post, but I thought some might
&gt; find it useful and informative.

I was lis ening o Tom&#x27;s e y clea eco ding and decided o pu i h ough Audaci y
so I could iew he spec um. Usually eco dings ha e a oo much noise o his
 o wo k well, which is why I like he clea e and cleane eco dings many people
call &#x27;Class A&#x27;.  Wha I ound go me o hinking and I wan o sha e my hough s.
 
Fi s , i &#x27;s help ul o know ha I ha e qui e a bi o p o essional expe ience s udying
spec a - om ULF up h ough sound and ligh and way in o he egion o adio
wa es and e en cosmic adia ion. I ha e s a ed a mo e spec um analyze s o e 
 he decades han I ca e o coun . So when I ealized wha I was seeing in Tom&#x27;s
 eco ding I was a bi su p ised I hadn&#x27; hough abou i be o e.
 
Usually when you look a a isual ep esen a ion o an audio eco ding, you can
clea ly see he noise wi h he signal supe imposed a op i . The highe he noise
le el ela i e o he signal le el, he lowe he &#x27;signal- o-noise&#x27; a io which esul s
in eco dings ha a e e y ha d o hea . In a no mal eco ding, such as you migh 
make o you sel speaking in o a mic ophone, he e is a speci ic way he noise
band disappea s when he signal le el ge s high enough. Bu mo e han ha , 
 his only occu s when he signal is in oduced in he ea ly s ages o audio 
p ocessing - a noisy ampli ie o example looks comple ely di e en han 
a high le el backg ound noise wi h someone speaking o e i . And ha &#x27;s 
wha is impo an he e.
 
Wha I no iced ha go me hinking was ha in he spec um analysis, 
 he noise le el was easonable o his ype o eco ding. And i was ai ly
cons an . I was wha I ha e come o see in hese eco dings excep ha 
 he signal o noise a io was a bi be e . Meaning he signal was a bi 
clea e ini ially. When he sound (which seems o be a young gi l&#x27;s
 oice) begins, he noise le el apidly goes down and almos comple ely
 anishes while he signal goes high. This is why you can clea ly hea 
 he oice: he absence o noise as much as he signal le el i sel .
 
Now he e&#x27;s wha go me going. I ealized ha his speci ic wa e o m
sugges s s ongly ha he poin o in luence is no deep inside he 
elec onics. Ra he , i is a an ex e io poin , such as whe e he signal
 i s en e s he sys em. And ha would imply ha some hing owa ds
 he ou e pa o he elec onics is being manipula ed, and no he 
 eco ding media o any hing nea i . 
 
This would also explain why oice phenomena can appea on di e en 
media and on di e en elec onics such as ansis o o solid s a e o 
 acuum ube. AAEVP has sugges ed, and based on his obse a ion
I would ag ee, ha he p obable poin o in luence is a junc ion nea 
 he a on -end s age o an ea ly ampli ie ci cui . E e y elec onic 
sys em would ha e his in common.
 
I ha e sugges ed be o e ha I belie e ha a leas some (p obably 
 he highe quali y) EVPs may be due o ope a o PK in luence.
Mic oPK is belie ed o ope a e a o nea he molecula le el as 
e idenced by hings such as healing. And healing agen s ha e
been iden i ied who ha e many simila ai s o PK agen s. So
i ollows hey may employ simila abili ies and use simila 
mechanisms.  This obse a ion is en i ely in line wi h his idea.
 
Does his mean ha in u h no disca na es a e communica ing?
In a d ama ic demons a ion o who I eally am, o mo e o he 
poin wha I eally belie e, le me say ha I&#x27;m no ye su e.
Maybe hey a e, and maybe hey a e no . This e idence does
no ell us ha answe .
 
This is simila o wo k in mediumship esea ch. We ha e shown
 ha mediums can ecei e in o ma ion hey should no know in
con olled labo a o y condi ions. Bu we don&#x27; know scien i ically
whe e his in o ma ion comes om. Appa i ional expe ien s a e
con inced hey ha e seen o hea d he dead, bu appa i ions o 
 he li ing a e qui e common as well. The mo e you lea n abou 
 his phenomena, he mo e you ealize ha many commoly 
accep ed explana ions all sho when applied in gene al.
 
As I w o e p e iously, he eal issue is ha science oday
does  no ha e he unde s anding o he ools o p ope ly 
e alua e his da a. Science canno p o e o disp o e his 
phenomena. No oday. An hones scien is (and skep ic)
will ell you his is an unknown, an anomaly. And so, as
 olks he e know, i comes down o belie in he absence 
o any p o ocol o expe imen o clea ly demons a e he
sou ce o hese sounds.
 
Bu I o one eel com o able ha highe quali y eco dings
will help mo e us along, i o no o he eason han we can 
elimina e some a iables. The analysis I men ioned can&#x27; 
be done on noisie eco dings; i ook a e y quie one o
be able o see his clea ly. And ha &#x27;s wha igge ed my 
 hough s.
 
I also no iced a iny spike be o e and a e he highe 
quali y speech. To some his migh sugges an edi , 
bu in his case I don&#x27; hink ha happened - he e&#x27;s why.
You can see he signal eme ging om he noise when
noise is s ill p esen and only when i achie es a ce ain
le el is he noise supp essed. Had his been an edi , 
 he noise le el on his close a sc u iny would ha e 
been a bi mo e ob ious - unless he edi o go e y lucky.
Bu in conside a ion o how he oice appea s and 
also he ac ha simila low-le el spikes appea 
elsewhe e in he eco ding, i would seem mo e likely
 ha he spikes a e a i ac s o he uning ha &#x27;s going
on o some o he andom e en s.
 
Once again, his makes he case o me a leas 
 o ying o ge he highes quali y possible. These
a e he kinds o   eco dings which scien is s may be 
able o use soone han la e as unde s anding and 
 ools ine i ably imp o e.
 
One las hough ega ding he no ion o PK as an 
explana ion. I is e y impo an we come o unde s and
PK well. Only hen migh i ac ually be used in a 
p ac ical way. I&#x27;m su e you&#x27; e hea d o hough abou 
a wo ld whe e you could li e ally u n hings on and o 
wi h you mind. O ype simply by hinking abou i .
Belie e i o no , one way o wa d o such echnology
could well be h ough he unde s anding o PK. So much
o Pa apsychology is ac ually explo ing he leading edge
(some migh say &#x27;bleeding&#x27; edge) o science. I shows us
whe e hings migh go and, ankly, ha is one in e es ing
wo ld a leas o me. Tha &#x27;s why I ha e been in he ield
