<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Funny you should say that because only a few days ago I myself read about doing this and its ability to open up your psychic side. I&#x27;ve only tried it a little bit, but you mentioning it again here will reinforce it and I will try it more now.  The first time I ever noticed my mind being able to do that I was over three years ago in an almost pitch black room at night in bed, and all of sudden I saw a fuzzy white cross floating near the ceiling, and I was like &quot;Whoa, did my mind just do that?&quot;  And I&#x27;m thankful for the fact that it was a white cross and no other thing, because I think anything else would have completely freaked me out.  The fact that it was a white cross kept me calm about it.  Later I tried to recreate the same white cross by thinking about it really hard, and I was able to do so but not as distinctly as when it &quot;just came&quot;. Recently I&#x27;ve been able to think about a couple shapes and colors and actually make them show up in my mental visual field (eyes closed/dark room).  Freaking fascinating.

&gt; --non-physically-- and look at stuff like this to see the colors, it
