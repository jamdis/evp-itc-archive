<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>the one and only interaction with matter that supposed ghosts can do 
very well is manipulating tiny, tiny air currents at their
source and predicting exactly how that tiny change will develop by 
interaction with other factors.

a lamp flame is not random  but its movements involve such 
complexities that it cannot be predicted; ghosts seem to be able to 
predict the flame, and divert tiny currents from across the room or 
across the street so they will be multiplied just before they hit the 
flame

flames can also be modulated by the bare wires from hi-fi output as 
the flame is conductive; inner flame minus outerflame plus

&gt; Yes, the speaker is about a foot from the lamp/phototransistor 
combo. Volume has to be adjusted so the mic does not overload, it is 
a touchy adjustment of audio and flame level. If the flame is set too 
high the unit generates lots of noise from the flutter of the flame. 
Also the room should be dark and computer monitor turned down to 
reduce noise the mic will pick up produced stray light sources.

&gt; 
&gt; So you play the audio from the radio out in the room, and record 
with the 
&gt; optic setup?
