<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Anyone have any luck with this calibration experiment?

(Note this experiment isn&#x27;t for anyone who just likes to play around with their board, and doesn&#x27;t really care to know its accuracy. This is for those interested in determining how well their board approach works).

&gt; 
&gt; Let me know what your board thinks it is. 
&gt; If it gets it correct, sounds like you&#x27;ve got something important going on there!
&gt; 
&gt; If it can&#x27;t get it correct, I suppose that brings into suspect all its other answers.

&gt; &gt; Hi Lori,
&gt; &gt; Glad that you brought this up! A true medium can give you a lot of the details that Ouija boards can&#x27;t. They can also give you complete names, dates, info that is totally unknown to others (except for those directly involved). 
&gt; &gt; There are some excellent readings on YouTube and I don&#x27;t mean the crappy ones...I forgot what this one guy&#x27;s name was (he is in spirit now) but he could tel you details!! I almost my skin chill...
&gt; &gt; I will see if I can locate some of those highly respected members of Spiritualism and will post those here for all of you to watch.
&gt; &gt; Blessings,
&gt; &gt; Al

&gt; &gt; You forgot yawn from boredom, that&#x27;s what I do.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Use it, don&#x27;t use it.  I don&#x27;t care.  But why bother.  When people ask me I usually suggest that if they want to communicate with ... whatever why not develop the ability yourself.  - ya, I&#x27;m one of those who believe anyone can.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; There&#x27;s always the question in the back of your mind whether your partner&#x27;s moving it.  The intentions of &quot;what&quot; you are talking to.  Not to mention it&#x27;s too slow and limited.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Besides if you take the time to develop the ability you can get more texture in the information.  Asking the board &quot;where you married?&quot; may get you a &quot;yes&quot; but a psychic might get the sense of a religious or civil ceremonhy, the garment(s) worn, other&#x27;s in the party, or whether that Being approved/disapproved of their spouse (ie was it a reluctant union).

&gt; &gt; .Yeah-that&#x27;s the problem with it I have found too. Most people, when you mention Ouija, either run screaming, or bring up religion. ----- Original Message ----- From: Frank Sumption To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com Sent: Friday, April 10, 2009 8:26 AMSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] An alternative to the usual ghost hunter stuff.
