<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Kay.  Your boyfriend&#x27;s opinion is one of the reasons why I put great weight on relevance 
of content in a session.  For example, when I recently asked for Rees&#x27; great uncle to say 
his name, and an immediate reply of &quot;It&#x27;s Chuck Clarke&quot; is heard (even though Rees 
referred to him as Charlie, both are nicknames for Charles) I think the odds would be quite 
astronomical of that being coincidence.  Same goes for any of us asking a question, any 
question, and receiving a relevant response ... it would be highly unlikely for it to be from 
stray signals (of whatever flavor.)  

Then again, if he has trouble even hearing and/or agreeing on the content, it&#x27;s going to be 
hard for you to get him to view an answer as relevant, even when it is.
