As usual, igonore all facts and all other methods, such as\nEVPmaker, which forms all the voices inside the computer. Ignore all phone\nEVP messages, ignore all voices heard with no electronic aids. Ignore\nmessages received via turned off TV and printers--and on and on, yet they\nknow all about EVP..Ignore the fact that probably thousands use boxes\nsuccessfully.\n\n&quot;We have conducted a few listening studies of reported radio-sweep EVP and\nthe results have not been good. We have also worked with a variety of such\ndevices. Based on what we know about trans-etheric influences, how EVP and\nvisual forms of ITC are formed and what we know about mediumship, it is\ndifficult to fit radio-sweep into any established hypothesis. Without solid\nresearch supporting it as producing EVP, it is impossible for us to\nrecommend it or support its use. If there were double-blind studies\nconducted by experienced researchers that shows it does produce phenomena,\nwe would gladly promote it as an alternative technique.\n\nWe are pretty sure that, in transform EVP (ordinary recorder), the voice is\nformed in the electronics by transforming available audio-frequency noise in\nan active part of the electronics such as a transistor junction. We think\nthe process is amplification of a weak telekinetic signal via stochastic\nresonance and we have found that the optimum audio-frequency signal for this\nis a chaotic one rich in voice-frequencies with many transient perturbation.\nThat is our working hypothesis. &quot;\n\n I can&#39;t say who this is from, cuz almost certain I&#39;d get sued. There&#39;s no\ndouble blind testing their BS either.

I love these so called\n&gt; experts that tell us that we can only make contact using their exact methods\n&gt; and we need to refrain from any other way of doing research because in their\n&gt; eyes were just spinning our wheels. So we can&#39;t get communication from\n&gt; modified radios and were all just hearing what we want I guess. I have heard\n&gt; it all,,&quot;I wrote a book and im an expert&quot; or &quot;believe me that wont work, I\n&gt; know cause im physic&quot;….in one ear and out the other. Everyone is an expert\n&gt; these days and most of what they say is BS. If I start hearing someone or\n&gt; something talking through my dogs butt guess what im recording it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sounds like these so called experts are just trying to deter and silence\n&gt; anything they dont agree with by doing there Scientific tests.

Their testing reveals exactly what they expectt,\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; is the nature of the paranormal. Getting the results they wanted, they\n&gt; puff\n&gt; &gt; out their chests and proclaim yet another victory for science! Science\n&gt; has\n&gt; &gt; a habit of supplying exactly the results wanted by whoever is paying for\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; tests..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; First, where do they find people that are somehow qualified listeners!?\n&gt; WTF\n&gt; &gt; is that S---!? It&#39;s BS, and they know it. Same old skeptic/science crap,\n&gt; &gt; except from a group that wants to be the worlds onlyest EVP authority.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure there will be articles in major paranormal mags proclaiming how\n&gt; &gt; the experts thoroughly debunked the boxes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; They keep testing and getting nothing, and the rest of us keep recording\n&gt; &gt; and have no shortage of voices that others can hear, can be validated,\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; gives infromation that&#39;s unknow to the listener. I just posted a video\n&gt; where\n&gt; &gt; a voice says &quot;I said fuck&quot; just to show it&#39;s not broadcast frags. This\n&gt; stuff\n&gt; &gt; conveniently ignored.
