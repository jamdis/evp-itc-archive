Let me know if this link gets through. I experienced this EVP at the 
Vulture Mine in Arizona on March 31st of this year. I was alone in a 
dilapidated schoolhouse built in the 1880&#x27;s awaiting my team members 
to come back from a lecture.

I asked for two &quot;rappings&quot; on the wall if there was a presence was 
with me. I was performing an EVP session just to kill time. What I 
got was footsteps coming towards me on the wooden floor. My 
perception was way off from the reality of what happened. I 
believved they were &quot;rappings&quot; and what I got was footsteps.

Is this is an EVP or some other type of event? Most EVP&#x27;s are only 
heard on audio after you check your recorder and is in a range of 
sound that the human ear can&#x27;t hear? Please listen to this EVP and 
give me your opinion.
