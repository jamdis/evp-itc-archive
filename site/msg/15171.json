As for the ones that got erased if the recorder is USB you might be able to use a file recovery program to unerase the files. Ive done that on accident with the camera and few other things to many times to count LOL and file recovery usually can access it like a harddrive and unerase them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 6/24/09, James W.

I haven&#39;t uploaded it here because it is so very low audio (sorta) but with your &quot;water&quot; filters you might have what is needed BEFORE it is amplified. I would like to send it as a WAV file so you can receive the most information. In wav format it is 511kb. I can hear it pretty good...but I am in question as to if the little girl actually says &quot;someone&quot; OR &quot;some woman&quot; said. You can do any enhancements that you might think will bring out the audio. If you have time. Thanks. Jim H\n&gt;"}
