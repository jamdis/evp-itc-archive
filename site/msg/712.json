Next time you wake up or buy a 1 hour tape or shorter. Then when you have time listen to it.If you get results, talk to them and say i could hear you and respond to what they said on ther tape. ofcourse thank them like anyone else . Most of the things that you will experience will come from people that have just passed on, either stuck, memory spots, which are like a movie, you cant interact with this, people maybe coming to see you, someone passing by, spirits know too if you are sensitive and will try to come to you. Some could be folks you &quot;picked up&quot; and brought home, you never know unless you get a higher evolved one that can effectivly communicate with you.\n\nangels4lyn &lt;angels4lyn@...&gt; wrote: HI Amy,\nI dont really think I am &#39;ghost hunting&#39;, but more just trying to find\nanswers.\nall we know is something goes on here, and we&#39;d like to know who, what, why\ntype thing.\nI was impressed with ghost hunters show because of their communication\nproof.\nthat got me to thinking maybe we can find out something here.\nits just really odd, because sometimes its very quite for 6 months.. no\nvoices, no activity, and then boom, it will be active all day long, several\ndays in a row, etc.\nwe never know.\nwe just dont get scared anymore like we use to.\nthis house sat empty for many months, they had trouble renting it.\nwe come along, and the first 2-3 years I wanted to move....but we stuck it\nout.\nI once lived in a very evil house... for some reason I get &#39;feelings&#39; about\nplaces and things.. and that house ..it had a feeling of evil , we had to\nfind someone who could help us. and then we moved as fast as we could.\nI saw the movie white noise. but I dont undertsand it.  so have tried a\nvoice activated recorder. have been told it will pick up voices in the\nhouse.\nbut not yet. but everything is so random here..I guess it could take us\nawhile.\nso I&#39;m here just reading and learning.\nLyn.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2c.
