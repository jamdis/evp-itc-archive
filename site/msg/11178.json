Best advice one cold give is\n&gt; try it \n&gt;   yourself for a while and see what you come up with =)\n&gt; \n&gt;   Misty\n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com,\n&gt; &quot;threadsintyme@...&quot; \n&gt;   &lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Why do you need to &quot;sweep&quot; the AM\n&gt; spectrum? \n&gt;   &gt; Has anyone tried this but without sweeps on the\n&gt; shortwave band? Has \n&gt;   any research been done? Could it be that the AM band has\n&gt; some sort \n&gt;   of &quot;special properties&quot; that would allow such\n&gt; communication? \n&gt;   &gt; Why is it that the AM band has to be used with a\n&gt; radio station \n&gt;   playing? There are parts of the spectrum that is just\n&gt; outside of that \n&gt;   spectrum that might provide a better form of\n&gt; communication. \n&gt;   &gt; Al\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt;   &gt; Click here for great computer networking solutions!\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; http://thirdpartyoffers.juno.com/TGL2131/fc/Ioyw6iighEHwMAbLKMUuYo359E\n&gt;   28alDzNnXaMa5yrqURXjmUoY4EK4/\n&gt;   &gt;"}
