Than a couple minutes later they say &quot;Steve&#39;s here&quot; or \nsomething like that.  I wonder if they have an &quot;On AiR&quot; light that \ncomes on when we turn the box on.  Almost like a radio station on \ntheir side, saying &quot;Well, we have a caller on the line----It&#39;s Steve \nfrom Keyport and he wants to ask some stupid questions&quot;.  Silly \nscenario, but that&#39;s how it seems.  To answer your question, i had \nasked if they had any messages for me before that answer came out.  \nBut there was too much time that lapsed between it, so i wasn&#39;t sure \nif i could use that as an answer to my question.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Steve.  Was this response in relation to something you&#39;d said?  \nI absolutely can hear it as \n&gt; you are, but I hear it equally well as, &quot;Howard said.&quot;  I notice \nthis a lot in my own \n&gt; recordings, being able to hear a couple very similar sounding \nphrases in the same \n&gt; example.  \n&gt; \n&gt; In regard your post about them maybe being earthbound ... I don&#39;t \nknow how we could \n&gt; determine that based only on what is said.  I suppose you could do \na followup session to \n&gt; ask who it is, where they are, and if he was talking to you.  I \nknow sometimes in my \n&gt; sessions, I&#39;m essentially &#39;eavesdropping&#39; on an other side \nconversation, and what is being \n&gt; said doesn&#39;t really apply to me.  Sort of like picking up on a \nparty phone line.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; &gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; &gt; group.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   File        : /Steve Hultay Files/Steve Hultay&#39;s Joe&#39;s Box \nEVP&#39;s/are_we_dead.mp3 \n&gt; &gt;   Uploaded by : urkel232002 &lt;urkel23@&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Description : &quot;Are We Dead&quot;---One of the best files i think i \never got.
