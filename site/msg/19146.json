The sweep hung up, and put AM reception\ndown below the band--I think. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s a weird feedback signal, as\nit was only audible in the echo chamber. Could it be an amazing example of\nspirit communication, naw, I think it much more mundane. It was after I put\nthe top cover on, so my vote is feedback notes.\n\n This is not intended to reflect on any other systems out there, real or\nimagined, only my own work is in question.\n\n Frank-S\n\nNo su e wha his lu e sound is.
