Being\nnewly dead might actually be a hinderance in terms of his ability to\nget in contact with you.  I&#39;ve been doing some research on the\nadjustment period after crossing over.  The general recommendation is\nthat you don&#39;t try to contact them immediately (funny - I am listening\nto a paranormal radio show and they just said the same thing as I was\ntyping that) as they have a lot to get used to and need to concentrate\non that.  I figure at worst, if they aren&#39;t ready to be in contact\nagain yet, they will be shielded from it and you just won&#39;t get\nanything.  However, I know of cases where they were able to be back in\ncontact within a few days, and sometimes as litte as 24 hours.\nUsually, the less traumatic the passing, the quicker they are able to\nbe back in contact.  If they had led a full life and aren&#39;t afraid of\ndying, it&#39;s easier, too.\n\nThe other consideration with the ITC is that it may take him awhile to\nget the hang of manipulating whatever it is they manipulate to\ncommunicate with us.  I don&#39;t imagine that that is high up on the\nchecklist of things to do once you die.\n\nMy condolences to you and your family\n\n\nNellie"}
