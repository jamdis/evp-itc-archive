&gt; Can you upload it to youtube or haunted tube?
&gt; Then you can post the link and we can have a listen.

&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] 1st night with Radio Shack-hack at Fort Mifflin
&gt; 
&gt; Hello everyone I am a member of Peace of Mind Paranormal Society here in Pittsburgh, PA
&gt; 
&gt; We just recently investigated Fort Mifflin. I made a Radio-shak hack with directions from UFOgeek&#x27;s videos. This was our first attepmt with it. How or where would i upload the wav file for you guys to take a listen.
&gt; 
&gt; I am having a hard time getting some of our more skeptical members to buy into the ITC-EVP ghost box stuff. I am convinced with everything i seen and read about Frank and all his work to what i saw on Youtube etc...
&gt; 
&gt; please respond
