<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Actually that I would buy into  But the question I have when you say &quot;tape&quot;
are you talking old analog tape or digi recording.  Here is the reason I
believe it can be do &quot;real-time&quot;.  As you all know we use electromagnetic
Field detectors in field investigations.  If a spirit can manipulate that
with to show that they are there by giving off a EM field whose to say they
can&#x27;t manipulate a magnetic strip of a tape or even the electronics in a
Digi recorder to speak in &quot;real-time&quot;.

&gt;
&gt;  Okay I have another one for you to think about.. I tape a session and
&gt; review it later..  even a day later.  Upon review the message that comes
&gt; over is about something that ‘just happened’ while I was reviewing or
&gt; happened after taping?  Is it possible that spirit can manipulate the
&gt; recording AFTER recording has stopped or even manipulate the audio while
&gt; reviewing?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; An give you an example of this I was recording one day and I reviewed the
&gt; audio the next day.  While reviewing – about half way through – the message
&gt; “Your mother is calling” was found.  I saved it and moved on and within two
&gt; seconds my mom called.  You say it is a coincidence except that I hadn’t
&gt; spoken to my mother in over a year.  During this same conversation with her
&gt; – we sorta made amends and I told her the story of the ‘secret’ I had found
&gt; out about a family member having a child out of wedlock in the late 1920s.
&gt; Quick backstory.. I found out about this out-of-wedlock birth through my
&gt; genealogy research and contacted spirit through the box and I was promptly
&gt; told to keep it secret and which I promised to do…
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Well in this conversation with my mom after not speaking for a year I told
&gt; her what I had found out.  When the telephone conversation ended with my
&gt; mom… I was amazed that the recording had told me she would call right be
&gt; fore she did – even though the audio was recorded the previous day.  I
&gt; proceeded to go back to reviewing the audio and the very first thing I heard
&gt; was:  THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SECRET – YOU LIED.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Maybe they can manipulate ‘real-time’ literally????

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   2 different things happening-that&#x27;s why. When you get EVP that everyone
&gt; understands, it is outward, in the environment. Not a communication through
&gt; subconscious means.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; EVP that people swear they hear, but noone else can make sense, may be a
&gt; message to them via subconscious means. That isn&#x27;t to say that ALL EVP&#x27;s
&gt; like this are true messages, I am sure alot are just matrixing.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; But then that is how the art of scrying starts-matrixing. Like the
&gt; Rorschach tests. The images you matrix with those gives the psychologist an
&gt; insight into your mind.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; By gazing into a dark, reflective surface, you start to see cloudy images.
&gt; At first, you will just be matrixing faces in the clouds and not getting
&gt; much substance. Try it, you will see what I am saying. With practice, you
&gt; start to see clear, concise images.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I think that is what happening with audio as well.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; We already know for a fact pareidolia can occur in audio as well as visual
&gt; stimulus.

&gt; yes I understand its personal to that particular individual but why can&#x27;t I
&gt; hear it.  I have gotten some very personal EVPs through the traditional
&gt; investigation way (not through a box or anything of that matter) that all
&gt; others have heard.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t know for sure about that one either, but I am not ready to discount
&gt; it either, especially since I stumbled across the possibility of audible
&gt; scrying. But I am sure alot of people don&#x27;t believe in scrying at all
&gt; either.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; What makes it a possibility to me is that so many people are hearing things
&gt; that are very personal, but stuff they would not have come up with on their
&gt; own.

&gt; I think that is the problem I am having though Jim.  When you say &quot;work
&gt; them over till you hear them&quot;  to me I should not have to work them over
&gt; till I hear them.  Yes taking out the ambient and background noise is one
&gt; thing.  But if you just keep on listening to them with different
&gt; enhancements you are bound to hear something (matrixing).  If one person is
&gt; not meant to hear it they won&#x27;t hear it (I guess I am not quite ready to
&gt; believe that one right yet).  I think you all know what I am getting at.

&gt; a few of my evp&#x27;s...from the begining I could only hear clicks and
