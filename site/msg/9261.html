That is some expensive boards, but I'm not really sure.  Hell it might be a deal.  WHat would I know.  I know how to turn on the box and start receving messages, but I'm at the learning stage.  I reading a book on basic electronics.

I've tried to make boards myself, but it's just one word c-r-a-p-p-y!

What I want to do is make some printed circuit boards that have the 
sweep, and amplifiers, then I would only have to add whatever tuner I 
want to use to form a system, and I could make the boards available. 
I wouldn't mind putting this stuff together for others, but the 
requests/demands are so overwhelming, there just isn't enough time.
