I Think Not", "author": "adrianamjones", "timestamp": "2010-10-01T08:41:05Z", "full_text": "So last Saturday I had my first ghost box session with an experienced box user who also claims to be an empath medium.  It was successful, in that there were too many intelligent responses from the radio for it to be &quot;a coincidence&quot;.  Despite this, there are some people I&#39;ve talked to about this who, even after having heard the recording of the session, still want to hold on to an old way of thinking at any cost to logic and reality.  Just because it is too amazing to be true, doesn&#39;t ALWAYS mean that it is.  For those of us that have experienced the paranormal in our life, we know that not all things in life are too incredible to be true.  But for others, it is harder to accept...\nTonight I hacked my first ghost box, a Radio Shack 20-125, it was an easy hack despite claims that it is difficult, and the fact that I am completely new to this area of research and know next to nothing about electronics.  I could really see myself spending a lot of my future life immersed in this, so can anyone tell me... what do I say to somebody that wants to claim that ghost box communication is a technological government conspiracy akin to the conspiracy of using Christianity to brainwashes the masses... (i.e. to keep them believing in the next life, so they can be &quot;raped&quot; and willingly give to Caesar in this life).  What is the proof and evidence against this being the case?"}
