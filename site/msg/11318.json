As for what methods to use, many others here have been doing itc longer than I have ( 3 or 4years)\n  i personally use a manual sweep method... many others here use this method- or an auto sweep ( after hacking an am/fm radio)\n  others still use &#39;ghost boxes&#39; and again- many have excellent results with all these methods..... there are many radios and cool gadgets to use ( like franks box, ovilus, joes box) etc etc.... but i use a trashed old radio that was in my garage and i still get good results.... so in my opinion, it doesnt really matter which you use.....\n  but im sure Steve, Bruce, Kay and Margaret can give you advice on where to start...\n  good luck, and welcome to our little corner of the spookworld...\n  :)\nCharm\n\nghostpi559 &lt;cfebach@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hello everyone,\n\nI am Clara and I live in Central California.
