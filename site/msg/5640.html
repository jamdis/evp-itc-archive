<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Juli,

I will try and call you today.  For me, this is the purpose.  I&#x27;ll 
try and listen to your files first.

&gt; For the last day or so I have been having activity at my home.  
This is 
&gt; really not uncommon, for it seems I have some spirits who like to 
visit 
&gt; every now and again.  I decided to ask some questions during my 
session 
&gt; why this spirit was here and if in fact the tec&#x27;s could bring him 
home 
&gt; or send &quot;Collectors&quot; to cross them into the light.
&gt; 
&gt; The questions and responses are posted in the file &quot;Earth Bound 
&gt; Spirits&quot;.  Some of the the files may be long in lenght, but I 
wanted 
&gt; you to hear the conversation back and forth where several spirits 
are 
&gt; talking and responding all together.  
&gt; 
&gt; Steve H. had a previous experience and had an opportunity to assist 
in 
&gt; crossing a so called Earth Bound Spirit over.  If in fact this is 
&gt; actually possible, this could be huge regarding our research as 
well as 
&gt; service an additional purpose behind our gifts to communicate.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; Juli
