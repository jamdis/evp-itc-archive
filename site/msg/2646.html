<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>He&#x27;s not a debunker.  A real debunker would actually look at the evidence

&gt; Good question ... just take the photo, show it to someone without telling them ANYTHING about it and ask them what they see.I did that with someone at work and he said he saw the tops of two heads down to the lips, and below that another image of just lips and chin.ZackOn Thu, 25 Oct 2007, Kristin Morris wrote:&gt; Maybe he is James Randi?s brother?&gt;&gt; k&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _____&gt;&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of&gt; Zack Widup&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 25, 2007 2:43 PM&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt; Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] No evidence is accptable!?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How could anybody NOT see anything in that photo?
