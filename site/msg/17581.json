I love these so called experts that tell us that we can only make contact using their exact methods and we need to refrain from any other way of doing research because in their eyes were just spinning our wheels. So we can&#39;t get communication from modified radios and were all just hearing what we want I guess.  I have heard it all,,&quot;I wrote a book and im an expert&quot; or &quot;believe me that wont work, I know cause im physic&quot;.in one ear and out the other. Everyone is an expert these days and most of what they say is BS. If I start hearing someone or something talking through my dogs butt guess what im recording it.\n\nSounds like these so called experts are just trying to deter and silence anything they dont agree with by doing there Scientific tests. If it works it works and if it didnt work what the hell are we all still doing here.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Got letter(e-mail) from a world renowned EVP authority( name withheld cuz I\n&gt; know the threats that would come), explaining how they tested the boxes and\n&gt; found nothing to it, y&#39;all just silly uninformed masses that don&#39;t know any\n&gt; better and they&#39;ll tell us all what&#39;s ok to hear and believe in! Thousands\n&gt; of box users and experiencers are either lying or insane!\n&gt; \n&gt;  Pseudo scientific BS! Their testing reveals exactly what they expectt, that\n&gt; is the nature of the paranormal. Getting the results they wanted, they puff\n&gt; out their chests and proclaim yet another victory for science!   Science has\n&gt; a habit of supplying exactly the results wanted by whoever is paying for the\n&gt; tests..\n&gt; \n&gt;  First, where do they find people that are somehow qualified listeners!? WTF\n&gt; is that S---!? It&#39;s BS, and they know it. Same old skeptic/science crap,\n&gt; except from a group that wants to be the worlds onlyest EVP authority.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I&#39;m sure there will be articles in major paranormal mags proclaiming how\n&gt; the experts thoroughly debunked the boxes.\n&gt; \n&gt;  They keep testing and getting nothing, and the rest of us keep recording\n&gt; and have no shortage of voices that others can hear, can be validated, and\n&gt; gives infromation that&#39;s unknow to the listener. I just posted a video where\n&gt; a voice says &quot;I said fuck&quot; just to show it&#39;s not broadcast frags. This stuff\n&gt; conveniently ignored.  I&#39;ve been kicked off groups for getting voices thast\n&gt; somehow were judged not ghostly enough, cuz all the experts know ghosts\n&gt; can&#39;t cuss, they can barely even talk and communcate!\n&gt; \n&gt;  They send me their stupid results thinking I&#39;m the one out there pushing\n&gt; boxes. Ignorant dorks, it&#39;s the results pushing boxes!\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
