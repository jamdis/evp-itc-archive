<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey Bab,

Even though I&#x27;ve newly begun to chime in here, it seems to me that 
some people are guilty of wearing rose colored glasses, as far as 
Chris is concerned. LOL! I don&#x27;t know him personally, so I really 
don&#x27;t know what really motivates him. Right or wrong, by conducting 
himself in the manner he has, it&#x27;s understandable why his approach 
has drawn the scrutiny from his peers. 

Frankly, this entire effort is a great learning experience and 
potential healing for mankind! I encourage all of us researcher types 
to simply sit back, and take a deep breath or three. Consider 
together why we&#x27;re doing this. Let&#x27;s work on making this world a 
better place while we have breath...

Success!
Lance

&gt; Bruce- Wow! That is a very bold statement, minus the name of the
&gt; person you are accusing (although it&#x27;s clear who you are referring 
to). 
&gt; I did read your apology for the negativity you&#x27;ve helped spread 
about
&gt; Christopher Moon. I acknowledge that your apology took a great deal 
of
&gt; humility. However, knee jerk reactions are exactly what I&#x27;ve been
&gt; talking about. People doing or saying without thought and 
consideration.

&gt; &gt; I think someone that stands to loose there bread and butter is 
making 
&gt; &gt; idle threats or having someone else do it. I would like to state 
for 
&gt; &gt; the record. SEND ME SOME DEATH THREATS YOU COWARD OR BETTER YET 
LETS 
&gt; &gt; SET UP A MEETING AND WE WILL SEE WHO IS LEFT FACE DOWN. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Who ever you are you better hope I never find out, it&#x27;s a bitch 
when 
&gt; &gt; the hunter becomes the hunted!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you got the balls contact me!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sum don&#x27;t worry anyone that talks about doing something does only 
that 
&gt; &gt; TALK!
