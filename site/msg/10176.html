<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Margaret, I do agree with that whole-heartedly.  I found myself 
almost changing the word skeptic to cynic in my former post. ;)

&gt; Hi LC and Stefan.  I think the term skeptic is often misapplied to 
those who are cynics.  
&gt; Skepticism is healthy and usually these people are somewhat open-
minded given enough 
&gt; persuasive evidence, whereas someone who is cynical is not open to 
changing their view 
&gt; no matter how much evidence is presented them.  
&gt; 
&gt; Just a thought that semantics might be getting in the way here, 
with some people using 
&gt; the word skeptic in it traditional/literal sense of the word, and 
other are actually meaning 
&gt; &quot;cynic&quot; but using the term skeptic.

&gt; &gt; Stefan, yes, I agree.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I should clarify.  Some skeptics/critics never intend to 
&gt; &gt; believe...their mind is made up.  That&#x27;s who I avoid.  Now a 
skeptic or 
&gt; &gt; critic who is at least open to the possibility of communication 
from 
&gt; &gt; the other side, I will point them in a direction to seek answers 
within 
&gt; &gt; for themselves.  :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi LC,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There will always be skeptics and critics, but one thing seems
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certain: everyone has their own time when they become open to 
the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possibility of the paranormal/spiritual existing.  I just 
choose to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; share with those whose time has come.  :)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I wouldn&#x27;t see an skeptical/critical attitude as something 
negative.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Some people just aren&#x27;t &quot;believers&quot;, their intellect wants to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; satisfied, too. :)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; So being skeptical/critical doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean not being a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;seeker&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
