Very interesting, Mike. I'm not sure if you know about Psychometry or not, but it would be worth a few minutes of your time to research. Just google it. 

I think spirits tend to be around, maybe not everywhere at any given time, but when trying to contact a particular spirit, it could be important to have an object that had any sort of physical involvement with that spirit. I can't think of the right word at the moment, but it's sort of like a beacon. Their energy is attached to it and when you try to communicate, they can go to where their energy is. It possibly provides a better medium for them to communicate?

That's just kind of my thought process on it. No hard facts, just my understanding. Any input on these thoughts would be great. Must...break...now...brain...hurts...

Jeremy

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Plane crash object key to victim contact?



Greetings fellow researchers,

I've been out-of-pocket for the last week, visiting the Washington DC
area and attending a 4 day conference where many high powered people in
that kind of business who gave some interesting briefings. Lucky for
me... I was in attendance and got to meet and listen to those who wear
lots of stars or are appointed to positions of our Nation's power base.
Unfortunately, the conference wasn't about EVP, ITC, or spirit
communication. But, who knows... maybe someday they (at the top) will
hold a conference like that.

Anyway... I wanted to give an update on my latest direction for those
who e-mailed me or messaged me while I was on the east coast last week.
First... I'd like to thank that documentary production company for
contacting me, asking about the use of my prototypes, but I have to
respectfully decline your offer as I only do this for my own research,
providing the information FREE to all who desire to built there own
devices. And after having been led astray by a not-to-be-named
paranormal radio show venue about a certain Stanley Hotel conference,
I'm a bit gun-shy at getting involved with such ventures.  Also, for
those who wrote and asked about me selling products,  I don't build and
sell anything. I just provide FREE information for my fellow
researchers.

Okay... on with my story.
While sitting in my hotel room last week I continued to read one of
Sarah Estep's books. In one of the chapters she writes about the plane
crash into the Potomac River, which happened a number of years ago. Many
people died when the airplane went into that frozen river, and she
explains how she and others began receiving messages from the crash
victims at almost the exact time time crash occurred, even though she
didn't know about the crash at the time.

She then writes about the crash of two jumbo jets, where hundreds lost
their lives instantly, or soon after the accident. And how the spirit
world was filled with communication because of this large disaster.

That got me thinking...

I too have always been super sensitive about deadly plane crashes,
feeling for the families of the victims, as well as, and especially for
the victims themselves.

One crash in particular put me into the extensive research mode about
the crash and the victims. So-much-so that I contacted the wife of the
plane's pilot, where I was able to help put some closure into her world
after a number of contacts. (Not wanting to discuss too much, let me
just say I was able to view things she was not allowed to view. And
after doing so I was able to describe things to her that she always
wondered about.)

The commercial aircraft in question crashed so violently that remains of
the passengers were never all recovered. And after years of legal
battling, the settlements were made and the entire aircraft wreckage was
released to a salvage company.
I was there, at the warehouse, when the many trucks left with the many
pieces of plane, enroute to their salvage yard.  And while there I
talked with the attorney and investigative lead, who were both on-scene
to over-see the finalization of this effort.

To get off topic for a bit, I for one am of the opinion that in the
spirit communication world, an object is key if communication with a
specific entity is desired. I know many do not agree, and think that
open communication is possible anytime, anywhere... but I'm not one of
those people.

I may be wrong or I may be right, but I think an object or location are
a must when specific communication is desired. hence, the reason I stand
next to a certain grave site, or location where a death actually
happened, or have a related object in hand or near where a session is
being done.

Okay... having said that, while I was observing the movement of the
plane crash debris, I was offered a small piece or two by those who now
owned the salvage material. (No longer in litigation and no longer owned
by the airline company).  I refused acceptance of anything at the time,
but asked if the salvage company had, by chance, forgotten something in
the warehouse or on the grounds, was it okay for a person to possess it.
They told me, yes.

Later that evening, when all the material had been moved out of the
warehouse, I once again visited the scene. Looking around I found they
had done a very good job at clean-up, only leaving a few pieces of small
metal, wire, paper, and fabric near the large doors.

I picked up the few items that were still there and headed toward the
large trash container that was on the property, my intensions to drop
those items into the trash. But, while holding them I received a very
strong feeling, a very emotional sensation that would not allow me to
put them in the trash. It was so strong in-fact, that I began crying. 
It just flowed through me, consuming me as it went.

My emotional feeling was just like it had been earlier in the day when I
placed one hand on one of the engines that were mangled and filled with
impacted dirt that was once the ground in the place that became the
final resting place.

Once I arrived home, I carefully placed the small amount of debris
material (metal, wire, carpet fabric, paper, etc.) into a sealed glass
canister, where it remains to this day.

Where am I going with this story...???

Two weeks from now, I have a two week vacation coming... which will be
spent at home.

After reading Sarah Estep's book, especially the chapter about the plane
crash victims, I've decided to use those objects I acquired from the
warehouse grounds, as the objects that may help me make some specific
spirit contacts.
I have already researched that crash, and I have all the victims names,
along with some information of there life's. Maybe I will be able to
gain information and answer some questions... so I can contact others,
besides the original contact with the pilot's wife, as I told you about
earlier in my writing.

All I can do is try... and see what happens.
