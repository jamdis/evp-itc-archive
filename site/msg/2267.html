      Take a closer look at the bottom of the woman's face, around the neck area.  It looks (to me anyways) that there is a mans face there also with a dark mustache and goatee, almost looks like the pictures of the generals and officers from the Civil War era.  Maybe I am just seeing more into it.  Who knows, very interesting though.
