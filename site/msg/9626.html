<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>THANKS FOR YOUR HEALTHY VIEW ON THINGS.

AT LEAST YOU DID NOT THROW LABELS AT ME, JUST FOR QUESTIONING A METHOD
USED. THANKS FOR THAT.

I WANT THE TRUTH TOO, AND THE ONLY WAY TO GET THAT IS THROUGH  RESEARCH.

ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A BELIEVER TO OBSERVE FACTS, PLEASE REMEMBER
THAT. SPIRIT VOICES ARE REAL, BUT WHAT ARE THEY? SPIRITS? YOUR OWN
SUBCONSCIOUS MIND? RESEARCH WILL PROVE IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

&quot;&gt; The question brought up some good responses from you guys. Let&#x27;s 
&gt; leave it at that and move on =)&quot;

YOU CALL THROWING LABELS ON SOME ONE A GOOD RESPONSE? I THINK NOT.

&gt; Opinions...everyone has the right to have them. The great thing is 
&gt; nobody has to agree with me on any given subject and vice versa =)
&gt; 
&gt; Bruce is correct that this group is founded on the belief the voices 
&gt; do exist.... as to who is on the other end well even the people here 
&gt; seem to have formed thier own ideas on that. Some based on beliefs 
&gt; some based on research some based on instinct, some just thought it 
&gt; up while watching a tv show that led them to join here. Others have 
&gt; decided it doesnt matter who what when where why or how it is being 
&gt; done, just the fact it is happening is enough to keep their interest. 
&gt; Not everyone that joins here is a believer. But everyone that joins 
&gt; here is curious and hopefully want to learn more.
&gt; 
&gt; I have actually heard this question/idea stated before and 
&gt; rementioned recently on a talk show dealing with ufo/government 
&gt; technology. It was only mentioned as possibility and mentions of 
&gt; conducted experiments that were used on people.
&gt; 
&gt; Look around you. The world as we see it is indeed a matrix, a peice 
&gt; of a peice of a peice of a much larger puzzle. In my own ITC many do 
&gt; not claim to be or ever have been a &quot;human&quot; some do not even have 
&gt; names/labels until they are given one.

&gt; &gt; Nathan, 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; I suggest you read the headline and description of this group.
&gt; &gt; We are a group of real time communication researchers that are 
&gt; &gt; continously seeking the truth. The founder of this board 
&gt; &gt; Mr. Frank Sumption has alway&#x27;s made it clear that It is not a place 
&gt; &gt; for sceptics and they will not be tolerated. We are here to study 
&gt; and 
&gt; &gt; further real time soirit communication, not have to defend every 
&gt; post 
&gt; &gt; we make or file we add. I suggest you take your negative 
&gt; accusations and 
&gt; &gt; detrimental unfounded criticism and scepticism somewhere else. 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; You are wearing your welcome thin here, not to mention within 5 
&gt; posts 
&gt; &gt; you have contradicted yourself three times. and went from the 
&gt; philosophy 
&gt; &gt; of aliens enslaving human spirits to questioning any chance that 
&gt; this method 
&gt; &gt; of spirit communication could or does exist and is a conspiricy to 
&gt; fool unsuspecting
&gt; &gt; people like us by means of a super transmitter.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; I have learned by experience to try and keep this type of post 
&gt; civil, So for any moderators that are reading this 
&gt; &gt; Please review the situation.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Nathan, I am amazed you would suggest or even think that!  I live 
&gt; in Cary, North Carolina and record when I have the time. There is no 
&gt; set schedule, and when I turn my radio on and someone says hello 
&gt; Michael, or even shouts out &quot;Mike Edwards&quot;, or a spirit tells me I am 
&gt; holding a carving in my hand, who would even know I turned the radio 
&gt; on? Only my wife knows I record, and we have kept this research from 
&gt; our children as well as our neighbors. So you are suggesting that 
&gt; Margaret, lets say who lives where I do not know, is playing a joke 
&gt; on me with a high tech two way radio?

&gt; &gt; Hi Nathan. I always look to relevance as a key in determining 
&gt; whether or not something is appropriate to the session. If this were 
&gt; a hoax, I would then have to seek an explanation for how private 
&gt; information is known by the &#x27;hoax perp&#x27;, particularly information 
&gt; that would require visual awareness. Some of us have examples of 
&gt; appropriate responses being given when asking things like, &quot;Can you 
&gt; name something nearby me?&quot; or &quot;Please tell me what I&#x27;m holding in my 
&gt; left hand.&quot; A sophisticated multi-transmission two way radio would 
&gt; not explain answers which require &#x27;visual&#x27; information of some kind 
&gt; (though I&#x27;ll be the first to admit my understanding of electronics is 
&gt; limited but I&#x27;m fairly confident on this aspect.) Of course, there is 
&gt; always the chance that the person running the hoax is also, or in 
&gt; partnership with, an extremely talented remote viewer or psychic who 
&gt; is able to glean that visual information from the ether or the mind 
&gt; of the experimenter. And what of those examples where people have 
&gt; confirmed the sound of the voice being &quot;just like&quot; that of their 
&gt; loved one in spirit? Surely the hoaxer isn&#x27;t also able to mimic 
&gt; people&#x27;s loved ones.If you are using EVP Maker with anything other 
&gt; than the allophones file, which contains no words to begin with, you 
&gt; are also running the possibility of &#x27;false positives&#x27; albeit they 
&gt; wouldn&#x27;t be from a hoax. Again, I look to relevance to be key, and 
&gt; relevant info that would not come easily to a stranger is even 
&gt; better. For example, I turned on my MiniBox for the very first time 
&gt; and said, &quot;Hello?&quot; and immediately received the response, &quot;Hello 
&gt; Margaret.&quot; If this were a hoax, how could that person know in less 
&gt; than 10 seconds, who I was by name. I had not given this information 
&gt; out. Not to mention that you have people experimenting 24/7 and 
&gt; receiving similar responses. How in the world could an organization 
&gt; have the manpower, technology, or even the desire, to attempt such a 
&gt; hoax? I mean that as a genuine inquiry, because there might be an 
&gt; explanation I have not thought of. I have one example where, via 
&gt; radio sweep, my communicator was able to correctly identify the 
&gt; status and location of a missing person (who it turns out was alive 
&gt; and well, so we ended up with confirmation that the info given had 
&gt; indeed been correct - which is much less complicated that trying to 
&gt; track and understand the clues when associated with the dead, or 
&gt; missing but not found.) Again, if a hoax, would that have simply been 
&gt; a lucky guess on the part of the hoaxer?Bottom line for me is ... 
&gt; have I wondered if it could be a hoax? Or simply a fortuitous tuning 
&gt; of the dial? Yes, on both accounts. But there is enough compelling 
&gt; evidence to rule out both of them as an explanation for the far too 
&gt; many relevant examples received by so many of us.Good food for 
&gt; thought, but after digesting it, I&#x27;d have to say, &quot;No, a 
&gt; sophisticated hoax does not sufficiently explain the phenomena on a 
&gt; large scale.&quot;Margaret--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Nathan Sharman
