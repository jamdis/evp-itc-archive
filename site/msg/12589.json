I don&#39;t really\nknow as many of the people there any more to really feel comfortable\nbeing there.\n\n\nMarty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;threadsintyme@...&quot;\n&lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Good for you, Marty! \n&gt; MPI is going to be reworked to meet some of the newer teachings\nabout Spiritualism. I would love to see some of the older views (like\nsuicide and hell, for example) go the same way as the dinosaur. \n&gt; Currently, I am working with a teacher out of Toronto on studies\nabout Spiritualism. Knowing about mediumship is one thing, knowing\nSpiritualism is quite another! I have had to change my perspective on\nsomethings, and that is a real part of the growth pattern of life. \n&gt; Al \n&gt;"}
