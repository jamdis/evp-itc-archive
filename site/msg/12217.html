<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks K yes most of it is very clear for me. I will try and get the rest of the files up in the next few days or so. My schedules a little crazy with work and life but I will get a couple days off later in the week to post more.

&gt; Hi Misty!  I listened to the sweep files on your ESnips and
&gt; they were
&gt; incredible.  Very clear and easily understandable - at
&gt; least to me!  Very
&gt; cool validation for Andy.  Congrats!
&gt; 
&gt; K

&gt; Hello everyone. I posted a few files from my recent sweep
&gt; tuning 
&gt; session. I will try and post more from it later when I get
&gt; time. There 
&gt; was one very lengthy message that seemed to be a higher
&gt; level &#x27;poetic&#x27; 
&gt; type voice. Also some messages involving a new member to
&gt; our group. 
&gt; It&#x27;s up to him if he wants to share his experiences.
&gt; However I did post 
&gt; the one file with his name because it has some significant
&gt; meaning to 
&gt; me that I explained on the file post there. It reminded me
&gt; of something 
&gt; Frank Sumption sent me years ago when I was a newbie and
&gt; had the same 
&gt; effect on me that it had on the new member.
