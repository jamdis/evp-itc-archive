 (don't know) does not mean that's not how there are feeling..then you have=
 to think what do they mean by the word "cold" are they speaking on the wea=

Oh brother...are you kidding us, Snow?
=C2=A0
For what it's worth, the=
 file in question is unmistakable to my ears and DEFINITELY says "South Afr=
ica." 
=C2=A0
Why can't some=C2=A0people hear these things? I=C2=A0understa=
nd now=C2=A0why Frank gets so frustrated at times, especially when people t=
ell=C2=A0him (or Steve or anyone, really!) what their files "really" say.

Further, I don't think people here share their=C2=A0files so that ot=

I'v=

Thank you for correcting me, h=
opefully one day i will have a better ear to hear the communication like yo=
u do. 

Maybe Frank and I should give up. He has about 8 years listening to=
 box communication and i have about 5, but the newer people are empatically=
 telling us what our files really say.

Maybe Frank and I are losing our ea=
r for this.
