&gt; &gt; Regarding the &quot;noisy&quot; box, why do EVPs seem to come through during 
&gt; &gt; people talking? I have noticed that I find more EVPs if I or another 
&gt; &gt; is talking, and then the voice seems to appear between and/or with 
&gt; &gt; the audio voices. Carrier, perhaps?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey mister this is the kind of post I like! I&#x27;ve been apprehensive
&gt; &gt; &gt; about blogging here because if you don&#x27;t regularly upload your audio
&gt; &gt; &gt; files it results in being ostracized by a lot of participants here.
&gt; &gt; &gt; And the fighting amongst some people is discouraging also. But I
&gt; &gt; &gt; prefer video as you and some others know. So I quietly videotape
&gt; &gt; &gt; sessions and share them with other researchers who aren&#x27;t anxious to
&gt; &gt; &gt; pounce on anyone based on opinion or frequency of posting here.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Suffice to say virtually every method of ITC is employed by me, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; call me obsolete if you want to but I still mainly use RVG maybe
&gt; &gt; &gt; because it&#x27;s what I have to work with even though most others 
&gt; &gt; embrace
&gt; &gt; &gt; sweep. I&#x27;ve got Hacked Shack and other commercial Boxes, but always
&gt; &gt; &gt; end up going to an early style Box with RVG only. It&#x27;s noisy, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; single mode, but it&#x27;s what I use most often anyway because of the 
&gt; &gt; results.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all; There are alternatives; 1-EVPmaker, a free program that
&gt; &gt; &gt; runs on a PC and performs the same function as the box, that is it
&gt; &gt; &gt; provides the raw audio spirits/entities use to form voices. It is in
&gt; &gt; &gt; fact the inspiration for my boxes. 2-The Mini box by
&gt; &gt; &gt; paranormalsystems.com. It&#x27;s a direct output, linear sweep system 
&gt; &gt; based
&gt; &gt; &gt; on my boxes, and it does work. 3-Use the manual sweep mathod, take 
&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; radio that can be tuned easily by hand, tune the dial up and down
&gt; &gt; &gt; slowly while recording directly from the speaker. Always announce 
&gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; are doing an EVP session before you start recording. Manual sweep 
&gt; &gt; was
&gt; &gt; &gt; the basis for linear sweep that the Mini box uses, and that I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; adopted for my boxes, and was first developed here on this group. 
&gt; &gt; 3-
&gt; &gt; &gt; Foreign language-Tune in a short wave broadcast in a language you
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#x27;t understand, and record directly from the speaker of the radio.
&gt; &gt; &gt; You can also use an internet foreign language boroadcast for the 
&gt; &gt; same
&gt; &gt; &gt; purpose. See coffeepotghost.com for more information. 4-Radio 
&gt; &gt; between
&gt; &gt; &gt; stations as a source of white noise. I like to pick a night when 
&gt; &gt; there
&gt; &gt; &gt; lots of skip, stations fadding in and oput randomly, this is a great
&gt; &gt; &gt; source of raw audio. You&#x27;ll have ignore the critics that cliam 
&gt; &gt; you&#x27;re
&gt; &gt; &gt; only hearing broadcast fragments, you hav eto judge the result by
&gt; &gt; &gt; meaning, that is, does the message mean anything personally? I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; &gt; sure there&#x27;s other methods out on the web. I suggest peole start 
&gt; &gt; wiht
&gt; &gt; &gt; white noise, and work your way up. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is nothing magical about the boxes, it&#x27;s a swept radio,
&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing more. It provides a higher level--louder--audio that spirits
&gt; &gt; &gt; use to make voices, that is all it does! I usually do not ask
&gt; &gt; &gt; questions when I do sessions, I think that biases the mind into
&gt; &gt; &gt; expecting, and maybe even creating the answers one wants the hear. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; rely on the guides to give me what I need. I also don&#x27;t do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;investigations&quot;, again I think it biases your mind into creating 
&gt; &gt; what
&gt; &gt; &gt; you want. I really doubt there is any haunting if no one is there to
&gt; &gt; &gt; experience it. I know---what I say is to be dismissed as it 
&gt; &gt; doesn&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; &gt; jive with the Hollywood version of the paranormal. Frank-S
