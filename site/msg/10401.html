<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Sorry for your family&#x27;s feeling of loss. I know the feeling all too 
well. 

I tend to run my own experiments without thought of what someone else 
will think about it so I will let ya know if they come by this way. I 
usually dont post newly crossed people out of respect to the family 
involved. I share it when the time seems right.

As for those who think it takes &quot;time&quot; for newly deceased to come 
thru, I tend to think it is us that needs time to heal because they 
have continually said &quot;time does not exist&quot; for them. It is a manmade 
function we place on ourselves due to environment and daily function 
as well as measure of life span.

I did get a Cathy coming thru repeatedly lately but not sure 
which/who she is for. Either way she just says she loves her dog 
and &quot;this is a proper hehe mom&quot; 

And a Tom-Son dunno who they are either. Toms son, thompson, no clue. 
all they said was &quot;whos an alligator Tom-Son&quot; I am bad when i dont 
recognize it or understand it so I just go phonetically for those. So 
I may be a lil off on what they say/mean.

And a Jason and a Jordan. Jasons statement sounded british he said &quot; 
well sugar I love my mummys sunday&quot; something. Jordan&#x27;s statement was 
about someone (Chris) not killing themselves saying it was Bullsh*t. 

I dont know these spirits/people so all I can do is document and move 
on. But if yours pop up I will forward them your way.

&gt; Hello guys, &amp; gals
&gt; 
&gt; I hope everybody is having a great day, its a beatiful day in the 
&gt; Bluegrass State of Kentucky.  I just had a death in my Family, and 
I 
&gt; was wandering if anybody does a session today/or tonight if you 
could 
&gt; try to get in contact with a Mr. Charlie Clarke,(my Great Uncle) or 
&gt; Mrs. Joann Clarke(his wife has past a couple of months ago)to see 
if 
&gt; you can contact them.  If you do contact him can you tell him that 
&gt; Rees will be asking to speak with them tonight around 7-8pm eastern 
&gt; time.  To see if they can contact me.  They lived a long and 
&gt; wonderful life together.  So all my family is sad to see him go, 
but 
&gt; we know it was his time to leave, and life goes on.  He should be 
&gt; happy to be back with his wife.  (He was 83 years old)  I know 
&gt; probaly somebody here might think this is crazy, dumb or 
&gt; disrespectful, but that is my business. I think it should be easy 
to 
&gt; get in contact with him since he just crossed over.  Please let me 
&gt; know if you tried and any evidence you might get from him.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; 
&gt; William Rees
