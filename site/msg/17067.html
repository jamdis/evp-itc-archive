JANDANACOSTA, 

Being skeptical about something - doubting something is cer=
tain - seems like a reasonable attitude with all the things we encounter in=
 life (politics, tv, religion, car salesmen, diets, advertisements, etc).=
=C2=A0 

So to answer your question "Also, I don't get why anyone who is a =
skeptic would belong to this 
group?".=C2=A0 Doubting and questioning resul=
ts can only make a field of research more=C2=A0 solid in the long run.=C2=
=A0 It helps to divide the weak evidence and methods from the strong. =C2=
=A0 While everyone is still free to pursue their beliefs, everyone only has=
 so much time and money,=C2=A0 and getting help with determining the best a=
reas to spend that time and money can be a valuable thing. 

So for anyone =
doing research, especially their own personal research, who is not wealthy =
and does not have 100 years left in their lives, being skeptical about one'=
s results seems not only a necessity, but I don't think any kind of progres=
s, especially in a difficult area like the paranormal, is even possible wit=
hout it.
