Some folks think it is a modulated\n&gt; em\n&gt; &gt; &gt; field in proximity to the microphone. There is evidence to support\n&gt; this, as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evp has been recorded in faraday cages and vacuum jars. It would then\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; logical to assume that evp is independent of vibratory sound waves.\n&gt; Then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that is blown to hell when you consider that Waldemar Bogoras is\n&gt; credited\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the first reported evp capture while recording rituals of the\n&gt; Tchoutki\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tribe in Siberia in 1901. The was with a mechanical gramaphone-like\n&gt; device,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; no microphone, just a horn to amplify sound, mechanical &quot;write&quot; needle,\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wax cylinder. Electric gramaphones didn&#39;t come about till almost the\n&gt; &#39;20s.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In that case it would appear that evp exists as soundwaves and not em\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fields.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which one is right? Both probably, and that isn&#39;t even taking into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; account the mechanism involved in box-related evp.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Intent and desire to communicate. The rest works itself out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Andy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And all of this supports the notion that the real underlying principle\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually psychokinesis, most likely of the operator but possibly of\n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; external agent as well. This would not require any external &#39;power&#39; in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sense we normally think of it, and would explain why such voices are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recorded in powered and non-powered devices all using various recording\n&gt; &gt; &gt; media. It would also explain the presence of audio and video since PK\n&gt; &gt; &gt; appears to be an ability to affect the environment with the mind, which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could extend to manipulating or creating video and audio signals.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In this context, conducting (or perhaps more correctly replicating)\n&gt; tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in Faraday cages makes sense; in that one could then rule out anything\n&gt; &gt; &gt; electromagnetic as a potential source. It may or may not be the case\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the sweep signal is critical to voice production. This is actually a\n&gt; notion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that needs further clarification - the presence of noise seems\n&gt; beneficial,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but is it required? Finding voices inside a Faraday cage in a\n&gt; replicated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test would actually be a very helpful outcome to advancing the\n&gt; research.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nTHANKS !!!!!!On Thu, Oc 1, 2009 a 4:05 PM, ou obou os2k2 ou obou os2k2@...> w o e:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÂ \n\n\n\n\n \n The in o ma ion was ea u ed in he book \"S ange F equencies\" by C aig Telesha, and is also a key poin in Je Belange 's \"His o y o ITC\" lec u e.
