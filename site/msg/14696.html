I see that Maury is having a show on your boxes, Frank I wonder who the  
guests are going to be, I would think it should be you, since your the one  
putting them together. sf

This is a wonderful recording, were you able  to free any of them?  So sad 
to see them still there behind bars, must be  very lonely for them, they 
should be moving on so, they can start to work on  making up for things on the 
other side.  You folks should go up there  again, and hold a small prayer 
vigil for them, of course they would no longer  be ghosts trapped there, but 
there are plenty more around.  sf

I was invited to spend the night in the West Virginia Penitentiary this  
past weekend. I was asked to give a short demonstration with my Optimus  
12-797 hacked radio. Deep inside the prison surrounded by concrete and  steel, 
the radio could not pick up any radio stations in manual mode. I  wasn't sure 
how this might effect the demonstration. I was pleasantly  suprised with the 
results. I recorded the session and the results can be  heard at this link.
