He spoke about sending his field researchers out with mini-\nboxes to schools, nursing homes, colleges, etc.  He was very open \nabout it on the show.  He advised the audience that he wanted to get \nopinions about the box from all walks of life.  I don&#39;t think this is \nsomething he is trying to hide...???\n\nMany of us our researchers here, and I think we would love to have \nour experimental devices tested by others.  Speaking of that, did you \never ask Mr. Moon to try the Radio Shack Hack 12-469/mixer setup I \nput together?  I seem to recall asking you to ask him a while back.\n\nI would like his opinion on how it works for him. I don&#39;t think he \nwill melt or anything by using it...\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;babiarz3&quot; &lt;babiarz3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; A few weeks ago I posted that Rick Moran had written an article\n&gt; stating that children and high school students would be part of the\n&gt; testing subjects of the mini-box. Later that day the article was\n&gt; replaced with a different article about the mini-box. I was told \nthat\n&gt; I was stating mis truths. I wasn&#39;t. I finally was able to locate the\n&gt; missing article. I&#39;m providing a link to the entire article along \nwith\n&gt; the statement regarding our children. If the link somehow becomes\n&gt; unavailable, I have done a screen shot and will provide it to \nwhoever\n&gt; asks.\n&gt; Believe me when I say that this isn&#39;t to cause or stir crap. I was\n&gt; basically called a liar and this clears up that misconception. If I \nam\n&gt; banned from this group for telling the truth, than so be it. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;...it was not the question of whether the phenomenon existed to \nbegin\n&gt; with, but rather what is the phenomenon.  That will require a good\n&gt; deal more effort to explore and beginning in January we will be\n&gt; undertaking test sessions all over north and east Texas as well as\n&gt; other national locations with a wide variety of folks to see what\n&gt; happens within the group dynamic.  The testing will include folks \nwho\n&gt; are both believers and non-believers, skeptics, critics, other\n&gt; researchers, children, high school students, college and grad\n&gt; students, and senior citizens to name a few categories.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.asup-inc.org/pages/editorial11-29-07.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you willing to &quot;see what happens&quot; with our children?\n&gt;"}
