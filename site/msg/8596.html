<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Margaret,

&gt; I figured at this point, the closest to a two-way conversation I could
&gt; get would be to shorten the time between listening to what has been
&gt; said.

Yes, I can remember that this idea had been discussed here or somewhere
else recently.

&gt; The purple deer comment made me laugh too (by they way, Arthur told me
&gt; purple deer eat apples - LOL), and the way he repeated, &quot;I told you
&gt; purple deer&quot; made me laugh too ... I wondered if perhaps he&#x27;d gotten a
&gt; little frustrated with me.

I don&#x27;t think so. Perhaps they were ROTFL, too! :))
