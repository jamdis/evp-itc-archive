or Bruce Halliday - A technician request


Thanks for the encouragement Bru=
ce.  You are correct I have a rs 12-469 and I cut the pin so it scans conti=
nually when needed.   I at times used audacity on my computer to record, th=
inking that speed control would be useful to interpret messages...nice thou=
ght.   I like the simplicity of your suggestion to just plug the radio dire=
ctly into the digital recorder.  Not knowing exactly how all this goes down=
, I thought the radio scan sounds need to mix in the room so that the techs=
 on the other side can respond.  Whatever works.  
 
The other main questio=
n I have is regarding the radio stations I can pick up here in my part of M=
exico, on the Yucatan.  I only get several stations during a complete scan =
of all a.m. or f.m. channels...don' t know if that is enough.  It has been =
suggested that I somehow can add an antenna to search for more channels, wh=
ich I would attempt if it is really necessary.  I get mostly Spanish langua=
ge stations and an occasional station from Texas that skips across the Gulf=
 of Mexico.  Not much to scan.  Any thoughts on this?
 
By the way, I think=
 the work you are doing is, well, extraordinary.    Like pros from any othe=
r field of endeavor, you make this stuff look easy to do...not so.  Thanks =
again.   Ron L

Hey Ron L., In my experience it does not matter what language you rec=
ieve the signal in.The entities are using only fragments, small bits and pi=
eces of the radio signalto form the words. Therefore it does not matter if =
the radio signal is in spanish or english or any other language for that ma=
tter. Our friends on the other side will manipulate the fragments they need=
 to communicate with you in the language you will understand. Ron you menti=
on that you are using an rs 690 that is not one of the hack model numbers m=
aybe you have gotten the wrong radio model. Check the part number it must b=
e a 12-469or a 12-470 and if it is the 470 it would have to be the older mo=
del or it could not be modified. Can you verify that you have modified the =
rs radio and that it is continually scanning withoutstopping on any one par=
ticular station? Also there would be no need for EVP maker or a microphone =
to be used during a session with the RS boxall you would need is the RS box=
 and a digital recorder, if you have the 469 you would need speakers to rec=
ord the session or plug the digital recorder directly into the radio. Pleas=
e check your equipment and how it is operating and let me know so I can hel=
p you further.Don't worry they are just waiting for you to set up the corre=
ct equipment and they will communicate. Bruce

Bruce, I now=
 have done a few days testing with my rs 690, evp maker, audacity, a mic, a=
nd my handheld digital recorder.  Nada, nothing, zilch.  Maybe because I on=

 the other-side.  Maybe they can't find me in Mexico?  Please let your tech=
