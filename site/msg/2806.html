<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey--I heard George Noory the other night saying he wants a box. I  
get one before George! ;)

BTW, I meant to comment to you on Chris on C2C--he sure was cagey,  
Frank. I could not for the life of me figure out why he&#x27;d make a  
statement like Tesla and Edison are duking it out in the  afterlife  
to create the first telephone to the dead (which is going to make  
anyone with a hint of skeptical nature roll their eyes and shake  
their head. God knows, I did), then not answer some of the very  
simple questions he was asked about other issues that the spirits had  
commented on through the box. I completely agreed with the the  
investigator who called and said he was being deceptive. He was. But  
why? And why show up on C2C with no samples--not one. It was very  
weird. In the first interview he did on C2C he was not hiding  
anything, it seemed (and he had samples). You backed that up to me  
earlier. He was basically telling the true story of how you met and  
how he got the box and what it had done up to that point. But he was  
not sharing with the class in the same way this time. What&#x27;s changed?

Profoundly
