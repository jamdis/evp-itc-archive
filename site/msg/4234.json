It&#39;s \nabout YOUR research.\n\nWe all know the long hours you have put in unselfishly experimenting with \nthe box.  If you leave, I will unsubscribe. There would be no reason for \nme to be here.  I could care less what Chris Moon has to say.  He hasn&#39;t \neven approached what you&#39;ve done. Nor do I think he ever will.\n\nSo please take a couple days off, go for some long walks, and reconsider. \nYou have friends here.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Wed, 12 Dec 2007, Frank Sumption wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; After a long discussion, and at times a yelling match with Chris Moon on the phone...I have like zero memory for verbal stuff, basically I think it came down to he said-she said type deal. I could agree with some of what Mr Moon said, but the bottom line is--I don&#39;t care! I have had enough of these endless pissing contests, one person telling me one thing, someone else telling me something else. I&#39;m not wise enough to tell who is telling the truth. I&#39;m done, I&#39;m not discussing this stuff anymore, I&#39;m not making boxes anymore. I have absolutely no interest in the so called paranormal. I don&#39;t sell this shit, I don&#39;t make any money, all it does eat all my time and piss me off. I&#39;ll finish this last box I&#39;m working on, and that&#39;s it. No more e-mails, no more discussion--I have had it!\n&gt;\n&gt; Mr Moon said he would be glad to come on the group and answer question--so there ya go, now is your chance. I&#39;m not going to be the go between, nor will I participate.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;"}
