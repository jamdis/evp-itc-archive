<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>There is also someone in Colorado offering a 12-469 (ebay item # 
160191131148) for $14.95 plus shipping.  The ad picture is of the older 
model 12-470 though, not the 12-469.  I know the Radio Shack website 
has the same mistake; they have the two pictures mixed up. Their 12-469 
page has a picture of the older 12-470 and their 12-470 page has a 
picture of th 12-469.
That is probably where this person got the picture from, thinking it is 
correct.  If that in fact was a real &quot;older 12-470&quot; he was selling, 
$14.95 would be a great price since it is very hard to find any olde 12-
470 in the stores anymore.  Remember, only the older 12-470 can be 
hacked, no newer 12-470 (all black case) has been hacked yet.

If someone were interested I would contact the guy and ask him to take 
a picture of the box. Then you would know exactly which radio he has on 
ebay for sale.
