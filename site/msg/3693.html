<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Definately interested in how this turns out.  I really want to 
experiment with the RS mods - I have an old laptop that is useless 
for anything other than sound recording and word processing, a bunch 
of miscellaneous audio equipment (im an audiophile) and i&#x27;m getting 
several of the radios to tweak with in hopes to find what works best 
and random seeding was something that I was wondering about.

I was thinking again about white noise generation using something 
like the echo box and relized that an old analog effects processor 
for musicians (i&#x27;m an ex-sound tech and dj, so its how i think) could 
be perfect - running the raw signal from the radios through say a 
delay pedal, an echo box, flanger, phaser, etc to generate more of a 
white tone and try to eliminate anything that could be considered 
just radio transmissions.  Besides, that gives whoever it is another 
piece of simple electronics to tweak with to communicate.

&gt; Excuse me if I mispell some things in this post, I&#x27;m currently 
&gt; running the production board for a LIVE internet radion program 
going 
&gt; on right now, and I&#x27;m doing 100 things at once!
&gt; 
&gt; Okay... According to some, &quot;...the Spirit Technicians and Spirit 
&gt; Guides on the other side have repeatedly explained that the way 
that 
&gt; the Telephone to the Dead technology works, is by spirit energy 
&gt; manipulating the random voltage generator (RVG) and using white and 
&gt; pink noise, as well as radio fragment, to create real time voice 
&gt; answers to questions posed from our side. The most important aspect 
&gt; to this device is the medium operator who works as an antenna 
&gt; or &quot;interpreter&quot; for living individuals asking the questions.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; So, that said (or copied and pasted) I have decided that my next 
&gt; attempt with the older version of the 12-470 will be the following:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Add a method of variable voltage used to adjust the tuning 
&gt; circuit, similar to the RVG mentioned above. I went out and 
purchased 
&gt; another older 12-470 today, to do just this.
&gt; (Frank... I did some measurements of that VT and found a range to 
&gt; work with.. I hope!)
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Add that white or pink noise to be mixed with the sweeping raw 
&gt; audio already available from the modified 12-470.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Add an internal antenna for the 12-470.
&gt; 
&gt; 4) Add an interface so the user will be a active/passive part of 
the 
&gt; radio. As mentioned above, as the antenna between the 
&gt; entities/spirits.
&gt; 
&gt; So... if I can accomplish all that... maybe the little ole&#x27; 12-470 
&gt; will be recognized by the &quot;experts&quot;, as having what the big 
mahcines 
&gt; now have... :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Wish me luck in my adventure... and oh, by-the-way... I hope to add 
&gt; all this, inside the existing case.
&gt; 
&gt; - Mike
