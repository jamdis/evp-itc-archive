Actually, =
 it's more interesting than that.  Not only do you not control 
what  the '=
spirits' say, you also don't control what broadcast radio says, and 
 to a =
large extent you don't control what your brain finds and interprets  
in th=
e noise you are hearing.

I listened to these (trying not to  look at the l=
abels, since once a person 
looks at the labels, they prime  their brains t=
o interpret the sounds in 
YOUR way, not their own  way).  To me, they were=
 either just a mess of random 
radio  snippets, exactly what you'd expect i=
f a 3 year old were randomly  
twisting the radio dial, or they were just n=
oise.  Nothing  paranormal in the 
least.

I think your instinct to stop po=
sting  this stuff might have been a good 
one. I suspect you are feeling a =
bit  overwhelmed with this field right now, 
and it may be something is  na=
gging at you inside someplace, saying it is a 
waste of your time or a  bur=
den on your life and health, or that you just 
need a little more  space fo=
r a while.

In any case, I'd recommend a break: take a  nice month off.  Se=
e how you 
feel being away from all this for a  while.  Come back fresh if =
you feel ok 
after that.  But if you  feel obsessed when away, it might be =
good to ask your 
friends and loved  ones for some opinions on what they se=

health is  more important than anything here anyways, and =
you can't really do 
a job  with interpretation of your results, much less =
your other  
responsibilities in life, unless you put your health  first.
