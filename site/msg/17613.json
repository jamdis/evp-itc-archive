I love these so called experts =\r\nthat tell us that we can only make contact using their exact methods and we=\r\n need to refrain from any other way of doing research because in their eyes=\r\n were just spinning our wheels. So we can&#39;t get communication from modified=\r\n radios and were all just hearing what we want I guess. I have heard it all=\r\n,,&quot;I wrote a book and im an expert&quot; or &quot;believe me that wont work, I know c=\r\nause im physic&quot;=E2=80=A6.in one ear and out the other. Everyone is an exper=\r\nt these days and most of what they say is BS. If I start hearing someone or=\r\n something talking through my dogs butt guess what im recording it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nSounds like these so called experts are just trying to deter and silence an=\r\nything they dont agree with by doing there Scientific tests. If it works it=\r\n works and if it didnt work what the hell are we all still doing\n here. &lt;/P=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://mc/compose?to=3DEVP-ITC%40yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;/A&gt;, Frank =\r\nSumption &lt;purplealiengirl@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt; Got letter(e-mail) from a world renowned EVP authority( nam=\r\ne withheld cuz I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; know the threats that would come), explaining how =\r\nthey tested the boxes and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; found nothing to it, y&#39;all just silly uni=\r\nnformed masses that don&#39;t know any&lt;BR&gt;&gt; better and they&#39;ll tell us all w=\r\nhat&#39;s ok to hear and believe in!

I just posted a video where&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; a voice says &quot;I said fuck&quot; just to show it&#39;s not broadcast frags. Thi=\r\ns stuff&lt;BR&gt;&gt; conveniently ignored. I&#39;ve been kicked off groups for getti=\r\nng voices thast&lt;BR&gt;&gt; somehow were judged not ghostly enough, cuz all the=\r\n experts know ghosts&lt;BR&gt;&gt; can&#39;t cuss, they can barely even talk and comm=\r\nuncate!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; They send me their stupid results thinking I&#39;m the=\r\n one out there pushing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; boxes.
