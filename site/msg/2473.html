From Hulda Clark's newsletter;
 
 
3. "Alien" Control 
"The invasion of th=
e body snatchers" was a movie that left many feeling uncomfortable. Being t=
aken over by aliens is not exactly what we are looking forward to. 
Certain=
 parasites can change the behavior of their host. One example which has bee=
n discussed recently is Toxoplasma: the parasite lodges in the brain of rat=
s and reduces their fear of cats. That way their chance of being eaten by a=
 cat is much greater, in the process of which the cat gets infected with To=
xoplasma. http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?/catalyst/s=
tories/s2050191.htm. 
Research shows that Toxoplasma can also affect the be=
havior of humans. Apparently humans infected with Toxoplasma are more likel=
y to be promiscuous, or to en dup in a car accident. Not much is known yet =
about the possible effects of parasitic infection on the behavior of humans=
 and animals, but it is certainly an interesting field of research that ope=
ns up here. 
What many do not know is that Toxoplasma infection is quite fr=
equent, in that 30-40% of all humans host it. Sources are manifold: for exa=
mple, test found Toxoplasma in 1 out of 67 samples of cured ham (http://www=
.nzfsa.govt.nz/science/data-sheets/toxoplasma-gondii.pdf). So if you have b=
een eating cured ham for some time, you are likely to have been exposed to =
Toxoplasma. Also, people who live with cats. "
 
 
 
 What if it makes you =
hear voices!? DOH! I like ham, and I have had cats (and dogs)for probably 3=
0 years.
