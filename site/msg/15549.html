<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Wasn&#x27;t me! I didnt join that group. I wont waste my time listening to his BS anymore but I will say more than one person sent me the exact same post so it is no rumor. Seems not all of his members believe what he says anymore tho I wont name names. 

And yes he attacks people and he means to do it each and every time. Members of this group, Frank, his so called &quot;friends&quot; the list goes on. 

WAKE UP! This is exactly why he is banned here and is not allowed to rejoin. Tho he tries and tries and tries. Last RECENT attempt was last week before he posted that crap and again he was denied.

This group is much better off without egotistic lies and the backstabbing. Too much negativity takes away peoples focus. Anyone who has a question should read the message archives of every group he has joined. Just do a search for his name and you will find the truth out for yourself. Those who keep the blinders on and sweep it under the rug, sorry theres nothing I can do for you.
