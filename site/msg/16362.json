I can spare the mic if we need to I&#39;ll get another. \n\nA Belkin Tunecast II which is an FM transmitter. Can we transmit a voice with this  and would you sweep or use variable voltage tuning?   \n\nAn inductive probe used for wire tracing. I have the toner as well.\n\nA polariod digital picture frame which the backlight on the LCD went out. But it has an SD memory card reader and speaker circuit. \n\nTie-clip mic/mono earpiece for a cell phone\n\nFew motion detectors, one of them is dual technology which IR and Microwave\n\na large number of RCA, mini plug, mini jack adapters and so on\n\nSome 12v sirens and bells, enough to scare the crap out of someone\n\nI bought a few small project boards, I have basic soldering tools.\n\nI see some possibilities here. But I&#39;m more interested in what you see, if anything. Could just be a pile of junk.\n\n\nOn a separate topic, I heard of a satan box or something to that effect. Haven&#39;t really seen anything but photos of it and a comment that people are afraid of it. Well I say that&#39;s for me. I have more churches than  anything in my area, so I can get help if I need it.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMark Cottell\nPPSMEET\nThe Phoenixville Paranormal Society\nhttp://www.meetup.com/pps-mu/"}
