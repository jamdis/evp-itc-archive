I listened to the podcast and I have =
to say those men were very unprofessional.  All they did was laugh, which s=
howed to me, that they had no real way of disproving it either.  I am not s=

reason, it is a threat to them.

 

 They may not be impressed with us, but=
 neither am I impressed with them.  If they were serious about finding out =
what this really is, they should have had Steve and Frank on the show so th=
