My research team has been around for going o=\r\nn 3 years now and have been through some 23 cases. Not one of those cases h=\r\nas reported that activity increased after we were there. In fact, quiet the=\r\n opposite has occurred. In a few our cases, people have reported that after=\r\n attempts to communicate with the spirit, activity has decreased.\n\nIMO, whi=\r\nle I can&#39;t say it is impossible, I believe it would be very rare for activi=\r\nty to increase just because you tried to communicate.\n\nAs far as friends an=\r\nd family, I learned along time ago not to care about what other people thin=\r\nk. People will believe what they want to believe, and that shouldn&#39;t keep y=\r\nou from pursuing anything you feel important to you.\n\nThat being said, when=\r\n asked, I just quote the facts as I know them - \n\n1. There is no proof that=\r\n ghosts are demons.\n\n2. Ghosts do not physically hurt people.\n\n3. They rare=\r\nly attach themselves to you and even rarer still, follow you home.\n\n4. Ther=\r\ne is way more to fear from living beings than dead ones.\n\nI hope this helps=\r\n a little.\n\nTake care,\nApril\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: brian=\r\n_empson \n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, December 29, 2009 =\r\n6:35 PM\n  Subject: [EVP-ITC] Getting Started\n\n\n    \n  Hello all,\n\n  First p=\r\nost. I want to get started with this stuff, and figured the best place woul=\r\nd be EVP. I got an IC recorder and am ready to go. I have a few questions t=\r\nhough.\n\n  At my friend&#39;s house there is *something* that likes to make nois=\r\nes when it knows you can hear it. It&#39;ll make big loud footsteps and general=\r\nly try to scare the crap out of you. It would seem like a good place to sta=\r\nrt buuuuut I don&#39;t know if attempting to communicate with it will make thin=\r\ngs worse. Good idea? Bad idea? Does it matter?\n\n  I really wanted to tryout=\r\n that allophone + EVPMaker combo that seems to be generating some good resu=\r\nlts. EVP voices are so faint it&#39;s incredibly hard for me to make them out a=\r\nt this point.\n\n  Lastly, how do you deal with family and relatives that dis=\r\napprove of this stuff? I live alone (well, with a roommate) and they seem t=\r\no think I&#39;m getting into some sort of voodoo or sorcery or something. They =\r\nseem to think that the voices are all demons or something. I don&#39;t know how=\r\n to explain it to them, I wish I could get them to understand. I am general=\r\nly a curious person so it was only a matter of time before I actually start=\r\ned with this stuff.\n\n  Thanks for reading! :)\n\n\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_0040_01CA8932.E36B7180\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18854&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;Hi Brian,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad =\r\nPro&quot;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;I am a par=\r\nanormal investigator and have been \nworking extensively in the field for&nb=\r\nsp;9 years now.
