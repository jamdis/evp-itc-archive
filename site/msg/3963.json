I&#39;m more of a tech as far as \nideas and an experimenter with functional tools. However, Ron \nRicketts is an engineering wizard and a friend. He lives in the \nDallas area. Would you like for me to give him a contact email for \nyou?\n\nLance\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kristin Morris&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Lance.  I have family in the Dallas area and get there often.  \nThe kind\n&gt; of help I am referring to is stuff like which tiny little spec on a \nboard\n&gt; goes to what wire?  Or how not to solder my fingers, etc.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks to Bruce for mentioning the SKYPE.  Thanks to all whom \nreally don&#39;t\n&gt; mind helping me begin my journey down this path.  You are all great.\n&gt; \n&gt; k\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] On \nBehalf Of\n&gt; Lance Oliver\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, December 05, 2007 11:55 PM\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Does anybody live near Austin TX?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m in North Texas, the college town of Denton.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are many techs in the Dallas/Ft Worth area. \n&gt; \n&gt; What sort of assistance are you referring to precisely?\n&gt; \n&gt; Lance\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups &lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt; .com,\n&gt; &quot;Kristin&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just wondering if there is someone close by to help me with \nthe\n&gt; &gt; tech stuff one day.\n&gt; &gt; Thx,\n&gt; &gt; k\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
