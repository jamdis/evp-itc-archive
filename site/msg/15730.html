<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>For the record, although I went into this with hopes of reaching my dad and brother, I have failed to do so.  I also went into this expecting to be lied to.  Don&#x27;t know for sure if that&#x27;s happened so far.

I agree with you about the &quot;not completely conscious&quot; statement (in my humble opinion).  If what traditional paranormal literature tells us is true, the other side sounds very similar to the dream state -- and we all know what our dreams are like.  Let&#x27;s just for a moment assume we are dealing with dead people:  if a person were to somehow get stuck in a bad state (something similar to the state where weird, frightening dreams are made), he might predict some frightening, strange stuff -- not out of maliciousness, but because he doesn&#x27;t know better.</pre>
