We all start somewhere in this field and we all have different levels of ab=
ility, but that should never stop any of us from attempting to accomplish s=
omething that we invision might be worth building. Just Do It! Now that I d=
id steal from Nike,sry Nike get over it. Keep all the work guys and thanks =
to everyone that has ever even tryed to follow an idea and big thx to those=
 that succeded.

Nicely said Jay!

In the end, does your device work?  That=
 is the only thing that's important.  Anyone can clip a wire and get spirit=
 communication, but few actually take it upon themselves to try to design s=
omething that can improve the communications with spirits.

Maybe if people=
 didn't get so offended and worked together this research could truly advan=
ce instead of remaining stagnant.

For the work I do, I need to have the mo=
st reliable spirit communication device.  I find radios to be a very poor t=
ool, but a tool non the less.  No matter how well the sweep circuit works, =
it is still a radio.  That is why I got out of the box and started testing =
to determine the extents of what the spirits can affect so I can build some=
thing more reliable.

lets move forward.
