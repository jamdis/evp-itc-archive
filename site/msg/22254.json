Why do you have to be so angry and continually use the F word. Every ghost or paranormal book I have read ( and I have well over 100 on my bookshelf) gives credit to you, Frank, and every paranormal or ghost magazine has given credit to you when there are articles about using radios for paranormal investigation. As i said earlier, most educated people in radio evp know who created the wheel in this area. So why do you let a tiny little yahoo group and a few uneducated posters bother you, which in turn upsets the rest of us.\n\nCB\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Way back in the way back time, or when I made the frist box I did in fact\n&gt; send myslef a copy of the schematics and system on box #1, known back then\n&gt; as EVP receiver 1. I forgot about this, being ten years ago. Note the post\n&gt; mark, 2002!!!! It was in fact random sweep only. So, before y&#39;all go\n&gt; following little fucktards like Hultay, and others making all the grand\n&gt; claims about how great they are, and how they invented all things\n&gt; paranormal, at about the same time Al Gore was inventing the internet, ya\n&gt; might wanna check your facts!\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;"}
