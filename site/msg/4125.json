Upon trying to figure out just where to do my sessions this \nafternoon, I had a idea.  Call me crazy but I plugged my camcorder cord \ninto the imputs on the back of my tv and into the hacked!  The sound \nclarity was amazing!!!  It is amplied 10 times the amount from the \ncomputer and if you place the recorder next to the surround sound, it \npicks everything up.\n\nHas anyone else tried this?   Please let me know?\n\nJuli"}
