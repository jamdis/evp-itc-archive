=A0=A0=A0I must admit I don't understand the thread/response numbering syst=
em here, so I'm going to post at the top level so as not to get in the way.=


A question was asked regarding how to post and more specifically label, E=
VPs. I would suggest that they be labeled in a numeric fashion. That way th=
ere are no external cues. Rather than exposing what they say initially, hav=
e a voting period where anyone can listen and enter what they think they he=
ar. Don't reveal any of the answers for a period of time, perhaps two weeks=
. Caution people not to talk about what they hear on this site in other for=
ums including of course forums on the EVP posting site. Once a period of ti=
me has elapsed, continue to enforce the guess-required rule in order to see=
 the other results, but go ahead and make the guesses public. Do not assume=
 that anyone necessarily has the 'right' answer, since at some level it's a=
ll subjective perception anyway. It is possible that the original poster, e=
ven if highly experienced, may have actually heard it wrong. Also, it would=
 be quite useful if EVPs could be easily downloaded as some may have
 acces=
s to more sophisticated software which they could use to clean various EVPs=
 up and repost so as to have a higher quality or enhanced version. A versio=
n tracking system should be implemented if you decide to do this so that yo=
u known that=A0 EVP # 12345 is the original for example, while EVP #12354-1=
 is the first variation of that same original EVP. Some ideas for you..
