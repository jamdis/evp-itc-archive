<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Most I get exposed to are ghost hunter types, they seem to only want the fear, and refuse to use this stuff at home---with the lights on.

&gt; 
&gt; I have tried for dozens, maybe hundreds of hours to get an EVP recording at
&gt; my home with a regular digital voice recorder. I have never gotten a peep
&gt; there that way. I have also tried in locations that would not be suspect of
&gt; being haunted, like random open country roads and fields. I never got
&gt; anything in those either.  I have gotten many EVP&#x27;s in cemeteries and in
&gt; some buildings that were supposedly haunted. This makes me think that this
&gt; method does tap into something that is localized and exists only in small
&gt; areas.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess my house isn&#x27;t one of those locations.
&gt; :-(
&gt; 
&gt; I have gotten names on EVP&#x27;s a few times and in each case the name could be
&gt; associated with the location from past records (newspapers, hospital
&gt; records, etc.) These were names of real people long dead.
&gt; 
&gt; The radio scanning boxes may tap into a different kind of entity. I don&#x27;t
&gt; know. But my experiences indicate that &quot;ghosts&quot; do only inhabit certain
&gt; small areas and they do not go outside those areas.

&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t mean paranormal activity, I mean--875 members and no one texting. I
&gt; &gt; think most are ghost hunters or &quot;investigators&quot; and waitng for something
&gt; &gt; scary to happen.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you want to &quot;investigate&quot; EVP, try staying home and recording. All the
&gt; &gt; fears about demons and what not entering your home is pure BS! I&#x27;ve been
&gt; &gt; doing ths stuff since 2000, don&#x27;t go the bogus haunted hot spot, record at
&gt; &gt; home almost daily as I test my junk, no frikkin&#x27; problems! Fro the most part
&gt; &gt; spirits, and the various entities exist in a higher level or demension, they
&gt; &gt; have full access to us anyway, there are no &quot;portals&quot;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yeah, I know, might as tell it to my dogs!
