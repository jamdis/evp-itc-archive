<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>When I first listened to the Spiricom samples several years ago, my immediate impression was: Hmm, it sounds like someone using an &quot;electronic larynx&quot; (speech aid device). This impression was strengthened by the observation that the buzzing sound often was even modulated by O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s own voice during the dialoges between him and &quot;Dr. Mueller&quot;! (Did O&#x27;Neill forget to remove the device from his throat while talking to his counterpart?)

And what about the &quot;13 frequencies&quot; that are supposed to be used as the &quot;carrier&quot; for the spirit voices? Why aren&#x27;t they audible in the recordings? And why does a mixture of the 13 tones created with Audition sound so different from the typical &quot;Spiricom buzz&quot;? - Well, if you analyze the frequency spectrum of the buzzing sound (this can be done with Audition etc.), you will find a lot of harmonics (peaks in the spectrum), and some of these harmonics more or less match the 13 Spiricom frequencies...

To me, the entire Spiricom saga produces more questions than answers...

&gt; Thanks Guy, I have heard a few people mention that O&#x27;Neil hoaxed it 
&gt; but I don&#x27;t know enough about this to really pass any sort of 
&gt; judgement.  Looking forward to seeing your website.

&gt; &gt; In regards to the Spiricom story - I have to assume you&#x27;re referring to 
&gt; &gt; the Mark IV model as diagrammed/written up in the Spiricom manual (as 
&gt; &gt; opposed to the INCORRECT diagram made by Polish researcher Wojciech 
&gt; &gt; Drewniak...http://www.worlditc.org/k_06_spiricom.htm ).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; While my research is still not finished (and I&#x27;ve been working on this 
&gt; &gt; for a little over 2 years), I&#x27;m leaning toward the Mark IV 
&gt; &gt; conversations as having been hoaxed by Bill O&#x27;Neil. HOWEVER - I believe 
&gt; &gt; he acted alone and that none of the other members of the Metascience 
&gt; &gt; Foundation were involved with this hoax. As to O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s motivation for 
&gt; &gt; the hoax - I still don&#x27;t know. But I will also say that the veridical 
&gt; &gt; evidence that O&#x27;Neil claims to have received about Dr. George J. 
&gt; &gt; Mueller through clairaudience is amazing and it is tough to see how 
&gt; &gt; O&#x27;Neil would have gotten this information given his finances, location, 
&gt; &gt; the timeframe, etc.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve been promising to get my personal website up and operating for 
&gt; &gt; some time now but have been busy. Hopefully soon. Then I&#x27;ll start 
&gt; &gt; posting what I have found out so far.

&gt; &gt; P.S. The recordings of the Spiricom cassette that can be found at the 
&gt; &gt; GOS website ( http://www.ghostpix.com/spiricom/spiricom.html ) are very 
&gt; &gt; poor. Scott L over at Ghostly Talk pulled much a much cleaner version 
&gt; &gt; directly from a source cassette provided to him by Mark Macy ( see 
&gt; &gt; Ghostly Talk show archive noted as a &quot;Bonus&quot; and &quot;Repost&quot; for August 
&gt; &gt; 22, 2006: http://www.ghostlytalk.com/node/616 ).

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;     I&#x27;m new on this group. Not too sure whether this topic was 
&gt; &gt; &gt; discussed already or not but I wanted to get your oppinion on the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Spiricon device.  Does anyone know more about it?
