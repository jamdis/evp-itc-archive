<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Cool I am glad ya had fun! Definitely all very interesting. And I 
will have to say it&#x27;s nice to see you getting your son coming thru 
there as well as others! Hopefully they will share what you gave them.

&gt;  Well, I had a good time, did several talks, and--get this! An 
investigation. Or rather I kinda tagged along on a group&#x27;s 
investigation and used one of the boxes. There was entities answering 
questions, and responding tot he group members. I gave the group the 
tape, so I won&#x27;t be able able to play those. On my own recordings, 
the spirits were pretty the same as  get at home, and even my son 
come through wiht &quot;My father did this&quot;, which I played for a larger 
group. I loaned a box to another group, and they also got entities to 
answer questions, and interact. 
&gt;  
&gt;  RoboBox did perform for a group, with at least one meaningful 
comment. A woman came to the table afte the talk, and asked &quot; Do they 
onokly talk for you&quot;&quot;, and immediately RoboBox put out &quot;for you&quot;, 
followed after a few seconds &quot;Loves to cook&quot;, the woman was a cook!
&gt;  
&gt;  The whole thing is very energy intense.
