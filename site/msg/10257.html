Yet another self proclaimed expert using my stuff, and other's stuff 
for his advancement, and agandizement. Same old story over and over. 

Bruce has only had a box since last fall, and just joined this group 
last year, by his own admission doen't know how the technology works, 
but will tell everyone he's the world onlyest expert! With years 
experience, while many here, to me, seem to seek the spotlight along 
with him. 

I have a site to share information on what I'm doing, that way these 
clowns can continue to claim it as their own.
