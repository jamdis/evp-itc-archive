I didn&#39;t want to charge the batteries connected a plus and minus\n&gt;supply, the plus side draws more current with the audio functions, so needs\n&gt;more charge current. I also didn&#39;t have the chips on hand to make a plus \n&gt;and\n&gt;minus adjustable supply for the charger. I came up with the switch shown to\n&gt;seperate the batteries for charging, or connect them in a plus and minus\n&gt;supply configuration to run the boards.\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________________\n&gt;From photos to predictions, The MSN Entertainment Guide to Golden Globes \n&gt;has\n&gt;it all. http://tv.msn.com/tv/globes2007/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt;Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;Tired of spam?
