<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Really????  What about the other 2 files i posted?  You can&#x27;t deny 
that there is some sort of communication going on, even the hardest 
skeptics as yourself have to admit the validity of those files.  I 
believe in a random chance of a stray radio signal coinsiding with 
the question asked at that time, but after 2 years and 4000 files 
later i have to believe that this communication is real.  I also use 
other methods that do not involve a radio at all, what could make 
that happen?  These are all good questions to make someone re-think 
their stance on RTSC and other ITC devices.  How can a scrambled up 
file on a computer program called evpmaker say full sentences up to 
25 words in length?  Did i mention that the original file that was 
used had no words in it at all, only bits and pieces of audio 
segments.  Something to think about anyway.  I used to stand on your 
side of the fence, but after a while it can no longer be ignored that 
what we are hearing is really happening.

&gt; I didn&#x27;t hear anything intelligible.
&gt; 
&gt; If I try to work out the sounds as phonemes, it sounds like:
&gt; 
&gt; Ah He La Naw Tay
&gt; 
&gt; Try reading that: Ah He La Naw Tay
&gt; 
&gt; Then listen to the sound again.
