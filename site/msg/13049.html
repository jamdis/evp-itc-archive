empty to me.

&gt; weve been doing some work with the radio shack box and this one in 
&gt; particular is important. my husbands father died when he was young 
and  
&gt; his uncle was murdered a few years ago. in many box sessions he has 
&gt; heard the two of them saying certain key things. in this session he 
&gt; asks for comfirmation that it is him. and askes how he died. at 0:22 
&gt; and 0:30 you hear something. i was wondering if anyone else heard the 
&gt; same thing. like i said in a previous post him and i sometimes hear 
&gt; different words.like at 0:22. it may be a gender thing or not but at 
&gt; 0:30 we deffinately hear the same thing. i have put the file in 
&gt; my &quot;folder&quot; for anyone to hear. it is under norther il ghost hunting 
&gt; team. thanks everone for your time.
