No method is perfect but we can all still learn and make use of the imperfections. Most mediums with more of a direct contact will tell you thiers is not a perfect method all the time either. I dont think we are meant to cross the boundaries completely until it is our time to do so. But we are explorers and more people become aware each day, and open thier minds to the idea that something else exists around them which they were previously unaware of.\n   \n  Good stuff!\n  Misty\n   \n   \n  bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n          these are captures from an FM sweep session I did today, they mention \nyou again frank.\n\nbruce\n\n\n\n         \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nChoose the right car based on your needs.
