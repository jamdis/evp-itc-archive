It is nice to see someone finally ask for the truth about some of the things you addressed. So often I see many people talking about Franks Boxes and working off of assumtions they make or things others have said, but rarely do they ask Frank rather than just go on with the ideas they already have about it. It is a great tool for this research and I think it can be used in a variety of ways by different users but Franks idea always holds true...its a tool for ITC.\n   \n  Misty\n\nrosemary_guiley &lt;reguiley@...&gt; wrote:\n          (Cross posted on itcbridge.com forum)\n\nMark Macy has posted two articles I wrote about Frank&#39;s Box, \nconcerning the controversy the box has caused in the paranormal \ninvestigation community.
