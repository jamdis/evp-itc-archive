I will\n&gt; see if I can try that. Maybe when I get home, I will see if I can \n&gt; copy and paste the text that is supposed to be read to the group. If \n&gt; I can, anybody that can help in synthesizing the allophones to read \n&gt; the text, that would be a great help. To do that you have to have \n&gt; Adobe Audition correct? Or is there anything else you can use/build?\n\nAdobe Audition or Cool Edit. However, I have read that the newer\nversions of Audition don&#39;t have a Play List anymore. But instead of\nusing the Play List, the individual allophones can also be combined by\nusing &quot;copy and paste&quot;.\n\nStefan"}
