Nathan,
 
If you would have come to this board spewing this nonsense a cou=
ple of months ago, you would have seen a whole different side of me.
But my=
 friends both here and on the other side have educated me on how to be a be=
tter individual.
So I will leave it at this.
 
You have changed your opinio=
ns and doctrine 10 times here in the last three days, and had the gall to a=
sk that someone send you a box to experiment
with. we, or I should say I so=
 as not to speak for anyone else have seen the religious fanatical website =
you are associated with and I know kind of understand what drives you.
 
I =
actually would like to extend my sympathies, it is apparent that you have s=
ome issues to deal with, But in my personal opinion you are a disrupting in=
fluence on this group and should
consider membership in a group with like m=
inded individuals.
 
This is not meant to be an invitation to a pissing con=
test, It is an attempt to quell any negative vibrations that would disrupt =
our research. You have already accused a respected member of this group of =
perpetrating a hoax, and have insulted every researchers intelligence with =
your ideas about spiritual alien domination and enslavement and persecution=
 of human spirits on the other
side.
 
I have done long hard research in th=
is communication field and have had many opportunities to speak to my trust=
ed friends and family in the spirit realm. Not once have I ever gotten any =
indication
of the nonsense you are trying to sell here.
 
By your own admis=
sion, you have never experienced any box communication, so therefore your o=
pinion and doctrine is completely ignorant and unfounded in relation to thi=
s research.
 
My suggestion is to sit back and try to learn by reading what=
 we post about the research and not post anything here until you have a sem=
blance of an intelligent opinion.
which in my assumption will never occur.
=
 
Please do not disrupt our group any further.

 communicator was able tocorrectly identify the status and location of a mi=
