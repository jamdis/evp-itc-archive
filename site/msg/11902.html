<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I remember when this was going on, I heard a lot of these EVP on the  
Jeff Rense Show. Sandra had been on the AA-EVP board before that, but  
had left. I wish she would put up all the EVPs because some of them  
were really, really impressive. The ones she&#x27;s got on this site are  
not good examples of what she was getting, HMO.

As for the Fish Group mention--I&#x27;m surprised about that, but they  
were plaguing people on the list at that time. Since I tend to see  
them more as 4Chaners (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan) than  
demons, it would make a lot of sense that they would get involved  
with bringing Scott Peterson down.

&gt; w. I just finished a couple hour review of the web site you sent  
&gt; for Sandra Belanger at http://www.heliumraven.com/home    Man did  
&gt; that answer a lot of questions I had about how this technology can  
&gt; work with mediumship/spiritualism.  Also renewed my hope in working  
&gt; with evpmaker.  The case history that Sandra recounts on the site  
&gt; should be a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone serious about evp.itc.  I would  
&gt; like to understand more about the relationship between evp and  
&gt; mediumship.  Does a &quot;good&quot; evper need to be a &quot;sensitive&quot; or medium  
&gt; or does it just give someone with the sensitivity the edge over  
&gt; someone else?  Even Sandra now says that she had a certain amount  
&gt; of &quot;sensitivity&quot; before she started using evp technology and that  
&gt; now she actually &quot;communicates directly&quot; with spirit.  To me that  
&gt; means she is a medium....no?
&gt;
&gt; Also, regarding the Fish Group...I was taken back to read on her  
&gt; website that The Fish Group was helpful in having her &quot;solve&quot; the  
&gt; Lacy Peterson case.   Chalk a good deed up to The Fish Group.    
&gt; Thanks for the web site.  Ron l

&gt;&gt; I could go into that quite a bit, having studied quantum

&gt;&gt; all break down to ... motion. It just builds into more complicated

&gt;&gt; and becomes light, sound, radio waves, coffee cups and coffee, etc.
