In the back of my mind is al=\r\nways the question of whether we are being Deceived.  Just for the sake of a=\r\nrgument, is it POSSIBLE we&#39;re being manipulated by something evil?  I&#39;m not=\r\n frightened, and I won&#39;t stop my own research (the negative stuff just make=\r\ns me more determined), but my mind does go there sometimes.  I hope that al=\r\nong with developing my &quot;ear&quot; I can acquire the gift of discernment.\n\nRobin\n=\r\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Steve Hultay&lt;mailto:urkel23@aol.c=\r\nom&gt; \n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n  Sent:=\r\n Saturday, February 02, 2008 8:57 PM\n  Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: File from ton=\r\night:\n\n\n  Robin,\n\n  If i may add my thoughts on this: There is no concrete =\r\nevidence of \n  who or what comes through is what they say they are. Technic=\r\nians i \n  have found were used to get you up and running and i only now cal=\r\nl on \n  them if i need assistance.
