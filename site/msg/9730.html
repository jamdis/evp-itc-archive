        There's one more aspect of Shiva that ought to be mentioned: Nataraj--the one whose dance turns the universe. Within Lord Shiva's dancing manifestation is represented not only all of time and space, but also the primal creative force that is beyond the circle of illusion that mortals live within, all movement and vibration of the universe, and the stillness beyond all existence. Shiva is the turning and churning cosmos, but also only an aspect and channeler of a higher frequency--Aum, which perhaps is the divine frequency, or in other words, "God."
    

    The metaphysics and advanced physics expressed by the Shiva symbology is stunning.

I have been trying to get clarity about the number 7 and today's
message was unusual.

I asked them what the number 7 meant to them and in reply I heard:
DONT FAKE... THE FIRST SON... SHIVA JUSTICE... THE SPIRIT (or could
be DESPERATE).. THAT'S ALL.

I know what the first son probably refers to.. and I have heard of
Shiva but never 'Shiva Justice'.. so I looked that up and this is what
I found in reference to the definition of Shiva Justice:

from: http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Siva_Shiva/id/137936

Siva, Shiva (Sanskrit) The third god of the Hindu Trimurti (trinity):
Brahma the evolver; Vishnu the preserver; and Siva the regenerator or
destroyer.

Siva is one of the three loftiest divinities of our solar system, and
in his character of destroyer stands higher than Vishnu for he is "the
destroying deity, evolution and PROGRESS personified, who is the
regenerator at the same time; who destroys things under one form but
to recall them to life under another more perfect type" (SD 2:182). 

As the destroyer of outward forms he is called Vamadeva. Endowed with so
many powers and attributes, Siva possesses a great number of names,
and is represented under a corresponding variety of forms. He
corresponds to the Palestinian Ba`al or Moloch, Saturn, the Phoenician
El, the Egyptian Seth, and the Biblical Chiun of Amos, and Greek Typhon.

Siva is known under more than a thousand names or titles and is
represented under many different forms in Hindu writings. As the god
of generation and of justice, he is represented riding a white bull;
his own color, as well as that of the bull, is generally white,
referring probably to the unsullied purity of abstract justice. He is
sometimes seen with two hands, sometimes with four, eight, or ten; and
with five faces, representing among other things his power over the
five elements.

"In the Rig Veda the name Siva is unknown, but the god is called
Rudra, which is a word used for Agni, the fire god . . ."; "In the
Vedas he is the divine Ego aspiring to return to its pure, deific
state, and at the same time that divine ego imprisoned in earthly
form, whose fierce passions make of him the 'roarer,' the 'terrible' "
(SD 2:613, 548).

Siva is often spoken of as the patron deity of esotericists,
occultists, and ascetics; he is called the Mahayogin (the great
ascetic), from whom the highest spiritual knowledge is acquired, and
union with the great spirit of the universe is eventually gained. Here
he is "the howling and terrific destroyer of human passions and
physical senses, which are ever in the way of the development of the
higher spiritual perceptions and the growth of the inner eternal man
-- mystically . . . Siva-Rudra is the Destroyer, as Vishnu is the
preserver; and both are the regenerators of spiritual as well as of
physical nature. To live as a plant, the seed must die. To live as a
conscious entity in the Eternity, the passions and senses of man must
first die before his body does. 'To live is to die and to die is to
live,' has been too little understood in the West. Siva, the
destroyer, is the creator and the Saviour of Spiritual man, as he is
the good gardener of nature. He weeds out the plants, human and
cosmic, and kills the passions of the physical, to call to life the
perceptions of the spiritual, man" (SD 1:459&n).
