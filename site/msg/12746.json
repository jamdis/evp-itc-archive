The elimination of intrusive carrier waves signals would remove any doubt that the message received should�be authentic and not doctored or misinterpreted through our ears and brains. But this calls for�the highest ethical stance by the researcher with video being shot, etc.\n&gt; IE, if you are not receiving standard AM or FM signals...then how are the voices being created? Seems like would be something worth pursuing over time.\n&gt; Has anyone tried this method?\n&gt; Al\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@prairienet. org&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; A Faraday cage is supposed to stop all electromagnetic fields from\n&gt; entering it.

Frank&#39;s box probably wouldn&#39;t work as expected in a Faraday\n&gt; cage.\n&gt;\n&gt; Zack\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sun, 9 Nov 2008, threadsintyme@ juno.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mike didn&#39;t cover the reasoning behind the Faraday Box in his YOUTUBE\n&gt;&gt; video...is it to prevent unwanted signals to come through? Seems like\n&gt;&gt; the Faraday Box could be self defeating... IE, if you are expecting\n&gt;&gt; radios signals to &quot;come through&quot;, how can they?\n&gt;&gt; Again, this leads back to the questioning whether it is the signals or\n&gt;&gt; the noise and the effects that spirits use to communicate with? IF\n&gt;&gt; spirits are using EVP&#39;s to communicate! I am still open to the\n&gt;&gt; possibility that spirits are. Doesn&#39;t mean the spirits ARE...LOL.\n&gt;&gt; Al\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -- &quot;ourobouros2k2&quot; &lt;ourobouros2k2@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This would seem to illustrate the divergence between schools of\n&gt;&gt; thought with traditional evp and itc/rtsc. While using a faraday cage\n&gt;&gt; to to prevent spurious and unwanted RF signals from contaminating a\n&gt;&gt; microphone would be helpful for traditional evp, would it not be\n&gt;&gt; counterproductive for box type ITC/RTSC? I am not trying to be\n&gt;&gt; sarcastic or anything, I am just wondering if the idea here is to\n&gt;&gt; ensure that if anything did make it through that it would most likely\n&gt;&gt; be genuine? I would be afraid that the RF shielding would be too\n&gt;&gt; effective thus blocking communication with a linear sweep box. If you\n&gt;&gt; did get communication from a box in a faraday cage, it would certainly\n&gt;&gt; make the skeptics and cynics be forced to present new arguments.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; thanks,\n&gt;&gt; Andy\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; While reading a book about spirit communication, there was a chapter\n&gt;&gt;&gt; which referenced the Faraday Cage. So... after reading it I decided to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; try out what the book suggested and placed my Radio Shack Hack 12-470\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Ghost Box into my microwave oven (in the OFF position) and ran a sweep\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in the AM and FM mode.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The AM mode did receive much less but a few audio snippets did make\n&gt;&gt;&gt; their way through. The FM mode was a different story. No frequencies\n&gt;&gt;&gt; at all made it through... just white noise as each FM frequency was\n&gt;&gt;&gt; reached during the sweep.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; As I always do... I made a short video of both modes being sweeped.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; You can see it, here:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.youtube. com/watch? v=KQwYmi70- qw\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; - Mike (UFO Geek)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _\n&gt;&gt; Click here to find the rental car that fits your needs.\n&gt;&gt; http://thirdpartyof fers.juno. com/TGL2111/ fc/Ioyw6iifl2jjF SWAPRh2ZuN3EgUoX WCuNwoeIW1vVPcQk uECIcak3i/ ?count=123456789 0\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ ____\n&gt; Security Camera for your small business.
