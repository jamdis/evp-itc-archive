Listened to this in WMP. Then I loaded it into Cool \nEdit and slowed it down a bit but still hearing the same thing. \nEither way, could not discern what was being said immediately before \n&#39;this is dead people&quot; but this part came in very clearly where even \nif you had not mentioned ahead of time what was being said in that \nsection, I too would be saying that this is what&#39;s being said there. \nWhat&#39;s interesting is &#39;they&#39; often identify themselves as &#39;dead \npeople&#39; and I know this because many others have recorded EVP where \nthey are saying that too though I myself have never gotten an EVP \nsaying that.  \nAt any rate, I&#39;ve personally never recorded an EVP or listened to any \nother EVP recorded by others where they are saying that are spirits \nor ghosts, or angels or discarnates in regards to general terms to \nWHAT they are. \n\n   \n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann, thanks for listening and your comments. Yeah, some of these \nradio sweeps do have an EVP maker sound about them. I use a rapid \nlinear scanning rate and have had good results using the FM band. \nHere&#39;s another slowed 20 per cent.\n&gt; &quot;Oh that is stupid...This is dead people&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave\n&gt; \n&gt; --- lisby@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Prototype Auto Tune Recording\n&gt; Date: Thu, 1 Nov 2007 19:06:48 -0400\n&gt; \n&gt; I hear that clearly.\n&gt; \n&gt; It does seem to be working rather like EVP Maker.

Anyway the \nvoice  \n&gt; &gt; is pretty clear--good job!I think the chip I&#39;m using has built \nin  \n&gt; &gt; AFC, and no way to disable it, so FM scannning doesn&#39;t sound too  \n&gt; &gt; good, but AM makes up for it.Frank- \n&gt; &gt; \nS__________________________________________________________Explore  \n&gt; &gt; the seven wonders of the worldhttp://search.msn.com/results.aspx?\nq=7 \n&gt; &gt; +wonders+world&mkt=en-US&form=QBRE\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Windows Live Hotmail and Microsoft Office Outlook &quot; together \nat  \n&gt; &gt; last.
