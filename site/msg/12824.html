<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Welcome to the group too =) The shack hacks are an affordable sweep tuning tool. People enjoy using them as well as various other devices. There are many methods to choose from these days.

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; I am new to this group also. I have been experimenting with
&gt; ITC for about 6 months now, with fairly good results from a
&gt; basic radio shack hack. I am hoping to learn more about the
&gt; set up of other devices and maybe gain some more technical
&gt; knowledge from this group.

&gt; Hi Marie. Welcome to the group. I enjoy manual sweep tuning
&gt; and have had some great results including direct responses
&gt; using that method. I think when they use my name (first
&gt; middle and last) constantly that kind of throws out the
&gt; randomness idea most skeptics have. But usually it takes
&gt; people hearing thier own names and info to wonder if there
&gt; is more to it.

&gt; &gt; Hi i am really interested in evp/itc and have been
&gt; recording
&gt; &gt; for 
&gt; &gt; aproximately 5/6 months i currently do both normal evp
&gt; work
&gt; &gt; and also 
&gt; &gt; radio scanning(not franks box or radio shack hacks)
&gt; but
&gt; &gt; manually 
&gt; &gt; scanning through the channels..i have been quite
&gt; surprised
&gt; &gt; by the 
&gt; &gt; results that i have got.
&gt; &gt; I have video posted on youtube(screen name mazblondie)
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; it would be 
&gt; &gt; excellent if anyone could give there opinions.
&gt; &gt; I have had many different theory presented to me, from
&gt; &gt; imaginationto 
&gt; &gt; plain faking it, but i can believe that it is all down
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; chance!!
&gt; &gt; Hope to hear from you soon.
&gt; &gt; Marie
