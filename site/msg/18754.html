<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I cannot tell you the technical aspects of this unit and thought maybe someone on the group could do that. I believe this recorder can record at a lower level than typical digital recorders (below a human&#x27;s ability to hear sound) and you can also do a radio sweep and record EVP&#x27;s with this at the same time as well. This unit uses FM for some reason, rather than AM for the radio sweep.

I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to get the unit to work in the different modes, to be honest and find it confusing to understand. The issue is there are not a lot of buttons and so the buttons are dual or triple use type buttons depending upon what you are trying to record or how you are trying to record. Hope that makes sense.

Hope this helps,
Country
