<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Everyone,
               I just posted some files from the TV session I did last 
night.  I would like imput if you would please.  I figure there is 
trial and error in this research so all comments are welcome.  I did 
not alter these files, so they are raw audio.

               In addition, the one audio file that say my name along 
with conference call looks like they knew I was receiving a conference 
call from Mike and Bruce, which I missed, who would have knew!  LOL!

               There is also a message regarding Roberson Place.  I do 
not know what this means, but say &quot;Get A Box&quot;.</pre>
