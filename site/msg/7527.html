<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The radio I was going to get today is the first one listed at ufogeek,
but it didn&#x27;t have a speaker and only used headphones, so I thought
that was the wrong one. I got the mini 300 model with shortwave, and
just took the cover off, but I have NO idea what to look for since
this wasn&#x27;t the one shown on the examples..and I don&#x27;t think I have a
screwdriver small enough to get the circuit board off.....

&gt; Hi Lisa!  Welcome.  I too am fairly new.  I joined the group
probably back
&gt; in November but I didn&#x27;t do any actual box research myself till this
week. I
&gt; am happy to report that I have had an incredible luck getting and
hearing
&gt; messages.  I use the RS 12-470.  This unfortunately is hard to get a
hold of
&gt; because it is an old model.  It is gray and white versus the black
version
&gt; that RS sells now.  But the 20-125 is readily available and
listening to the
&gt; files from others who use the 20-125 it seems to be great!  I am
going to
&gt; get one of those too.
&gt; 
&gt; As for hacking - I&#x27;m not technical either and didn&#x27;t think I could
do it,
&gt; but plenty of our members UFOGEEK.com (Mike Colletta) has step by step
&gt; videos to walk you through.  It was not difficult.  You just have to
try.
&gt; Anyway - I spent many months just listening to other people&#x27;s clips
and I
&gt; really believe that helped to train my ear so when I began my own
research
&gt; it was a smooth transition.  I&#x27;m not saying to wait a couple months like
&gt; me.. I was just chicken sh* t (if you know what I mean :-) )  but
listen to
&gt; every clip you can - believe me it helps!  The people on the board are
&gt; extremely helpful and want to see you succeed!
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Welcome !!!

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I am new to the group and wanted to say hello. My name is Lisa and I
&gt; am the Founder &amp; Director of PRISM, Paranormal Researchers in
&gt; Southeastern Michigan. My fascination with evps and all of the &#x27;buzz&#x27;
&gt; about these boxes lately have me more curious than a cat lol So, here
&gt; I am!
&gt; 
&gt; I am wondering if you can purchase a radio anywhere to hack it, or if
&gt; it has to be a radio from Radio Shack? Sorry if my question seems
&gt; stupid..I am NOT a technical person at all, so this will be
&gt; interesting, to say the least. I have been browsing through the
&gt; messages and some are like Chinese to me right now, but none the less
&gt; I am enjoying them :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Best of luck to all with their ongoing research!
&gt; 
&gt; Lisa
