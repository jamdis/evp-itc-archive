After tearing it apart, cutting, desoldering, etc...to locate\nthe mute wire/pin/solder pad, I found out that it can be one of the\neasiest hacks out there. \n\nRather than disassembling and such, simply cut the trace on each side\nof the mute pin solder pad. Takes about 30 seconds with a hobby knife.\nI felt really stupid after 4 hours taking everything apart and\ndesoldering wires, etc...\n\ninstructions with photos can be found on my blog if interested. \n\nhttp://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=405441717&blogID=445524854\n\nThe sound quality of this thing really rocks, and I love the external\nantenna options...\n\nthanks \nAndy"}
