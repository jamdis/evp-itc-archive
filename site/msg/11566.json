I&#39;m about an hour or hour and a half away. I&#39;m just north of Tampa. So I&#39;m thinking about going tomorrow. Hopefully thewebcast will be fixed soon. I just don&#39;t want to show up and find out there is no room to go to the lectures or anything. It says a 70 person capacity for seats, and then whatever standing room there is. That to me doesn&#39;t seem like good odds, so I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do.\n\n-Aaron"}
