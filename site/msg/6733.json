The reason for that is you will allow  \n&gt; your tech/guide to stay\n&gt; familiar and associated with all the boxes you have and you will  \n&gt; want your &quot;ear&quot; to be attuned\n&gt; to the rhythm and sound of all your boxes so that at any given time  \n&gt; you can use anyone for a session and\n&gt; be successful in understanding the communication. Also you may find  \n&gt; that at a particular time you may be\n&gt; doing a session with the MB and not getting good results, you can  \n&gt; switch to the RS 470 and have a better session.\n&gt;\n&gt; In any case you will want to have research results from all the  \n&gt; various boxes available to you.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; From: lisby@...\n&gt; Date: Sat, 2 Feb 2008 08:21:18 -0500\n&gt; Subject: Re: For Bruce Re: [EVP-ITC] ok here we are I posted a  \n&gt; bunch of new RS470 files to esnips\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t have any files on esnips.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m attaching one to this e-mail.
