This is the latest printed board I just now ordered. If anyone wants to see 
it you have to download the PCBExpress software at www.PCBexpress.com. The 
silk screen markings are for assembly purposes, and won&#x27;t be on this order, 
so I didn&#x27;t care if there was some over lap. There&#x27;s no way to mark the 
layout underside components, but I have my notes for that. All components 
are from mouser.com.

Even though the layout is labled &quot;RVG&quot;, it is in fact linear and random, AM 
and FM, with stereo input and output (except for the monitor speaker). There 
is provision for both wire, and bar antennas. The board was made extra 
copmpact to reduce cost, I wanted to keep the two boards under $100, the 
cost was about $93. With silk screen and solder mask, they would have been 
double.

After endless hours staring at the screen, my eys are about fried, I have a 
spot in the right eye, that hopefully will clear up.
