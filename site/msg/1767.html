<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Piece of cake! The boxes are pretty much ready, it requires only 
connecting the box line out to the sound card input, and sending out 
over the internet, which I have no idea how to do the soft ware 
part, but the guy that suggested seems to. 

 I&#x27;m sure that people in different locations would get different 
messages although, presumalby, the box was outputing only a single 
stream of information. 

 This is something to be excited about. It could be just weeks away.

&gt; Thats an awesome idea. imagine though its streaming live across 
cables
&gt; throughout the states. The possibility of the audio being further
&gt; influenced is greater Im sure. Reminds me of when a radio show was
&gt; being done on evps people recording the show played it back later 
to
&gt; listen again and heard messages to them during the play back and 
this
&gt; was being reported from tons of people. So its pretty interesting 
if
&gt; you can actually have this done, cant wait to see what happens.

&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s like DAH!!! Why I not think about this!? Setup an internet 
server 
&gt; &gt; (somehow) and connect a box to the internet to run 24/7----LIVE. 
Or
&gt; make 
&gt; &gt; coordinated short tests so remote reception can be compared to
&gt; local. It 
&gt; &gt; would be an easy task to make modes and bands switchable 
remotely as
&gt; well. 
&gt; &gt; What about multiple boxes?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Just imagine, a box accessible to the world 24 hours a day, seven
&gt; days a 
&gt; &gt; week! It staggers the imagination! Given the nature of the 
voices and 
&gt; &gt; contacts, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if several people could access 
the
&gt; system 
&gt; &gt; at the exact same time, yet all receive personal communications.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Guess that would create wee ripple in the darkside!!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I wasn&#x27;t sure if the originator of the idea wanted his name out
&gt; there, I 
&gt; &gt; took it off.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There&#x27;s no way I can stop making boxes, I just don&#x27;t have the
&gt; &gt; &gt;resuources to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supply them to everyone that wants at this time, plus trying 
ot find
&gt; &gt; &gt;waay to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make the things more better. I am no engineer, and it takes a

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; figure things out--as with all aspects of this life.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Hey Frank,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Its me again
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I haven&#x27;t had much time to work on ITC lately but I&#x27;m 
interested in
&gt; &gt; &gt;taking a slightly different approach using a quantum random 
number
&gt; &gt; &gt;generator (unless its cost prohibitive) and computer (hoping it
&gt; &gt; &gt;doesn&#x27;t get fried).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;But... what are your thoughts on this:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;What if we hooked up one of your boxes to the internet for 
remote
&gt; &gt; &gt;users to attempt interaction with?  Leaning on the non-locality 
theory.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Couple things I&#x27;m wondering about, assuming it works:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;- Would the box work &quot;better&quot; physically present at a &quot;high 
energy&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt;location?  I&#x27;m refering to locations on Earth that are known to 
be
&gt; &gt; &gt;high energy from lay lines, etc. &quot;portals&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt;- Will the recorded audio from your box be the same recorded or 
heard
&gt; &gt; &gt;audio at the remote location?  Meaning will the EVP be 
recordable at
&gt; &gt; &gt;your location or only the remote users location?  Or if both, 
will
&gt; &gt; &gt;they match?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Just some things I&#x27;ve been thinking about lately.  Curious what 
you
&gt; think.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
