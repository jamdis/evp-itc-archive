Obviously this is going no where. I'm just being mean mostly, but i=

=C2=A0You can use science to prove or disprove=
 whatever you want, so what good is it. How many toxic drugs get approved e=

be pulled of the market cuz of all the death they cause. How many thousands=

ns that are easily treated with electricity, but "science", aka medical sci=
ence claims only drugs cure desease. Before y'all get all huffy, I had a do=
g that had a staph infection in a rear foot, the vet cut the whole damn pad=
 off, and gave the standard antibiotics. The infection came right back. I h=
eld the dog's back feet on a device called a zapper, one treatment, 15 minu=
tes, no more infection! The zapper puts out a 3.9khz square wave that kills=
 the germs, But y'all are brainwashed to believe that can not possibly work=
