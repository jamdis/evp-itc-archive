I&#39;ve been doing this for some years now, and it seems like ya can&#39;t go two weeks without someone that thinks they know more, or their &quot;theories&quot; are more valid, or someone that believes for whatever reason they are the box/EVP/paranormal expert. I&#39;ve had enough, these groups are pointless, and I&#39;m tired of the BS. There is always these incessant arguements with those that seem to think they know better than anyone else. Maybe it&#39;s just me, and my over reactions, but at this point, I don&#39;t care, enough is enough. So ya want the group? I don&#39;t actually own it due to one of these idiotic arguements, but have at it, cuz I ain&#39;t playing this game anymore. I&#39;ll continue my own work, in my own time, and in my own way.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S"}
