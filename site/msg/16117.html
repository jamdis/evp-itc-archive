<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It depends on what radiation you&#x27;re talking about,  the electronic equipment
and what it&#x27;s made of.

EMP (electromagnetic pulse) generated at the time of a nuclear detonation
will probably wipe out any solid-state electronics that isn&#x27;t heavily
shielded against it. Alpha and beta particles could affect some electronics
that managed to survive an EMP.

The older stuff like RTL and TTL logic is probably not going to be much
affected by the alpha and beta radiation. CMOS devices, sensitive to static
discharges, would be next. VLSI chips have the greatest chance of being
affected (read: home computers). Vacuum tube circuits would hardly be
affected at all, even by EMP.
Strange that some of our oldest devices would be the last to go.

&gt; Does anyone here know anything about radiation? In particularly if it can
&gt; cause electronic equipment to malfunction?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!

I depends on wha adia ion you&#x27; e alking abou ,   he elec onic equipmen and wha i &#x27;s made o . 
 
EMP (elec omagne ic pulse) gene a ed a he ime o a nuclea de ona ion will p obably wipe ou any solid-s a e elec onics ha isn&#x27; hea ily shielded agains i . Alpha and be a pa icles could a ec some elec onics ha managed o su i e an EMP.

 
The olde s u like RTL and TTL logic is p obably no going o be much a ec ed by he alpha and be a adia ion. CMOS de ices, sensi i e o s a ic discha ges, would be nex . VLSI chips ha e he g ea es chance o being a ec ed ( ead: home compu e s). Vacuum ube ci cui s would ha dly be a ec ed a all, e en by EMP.

S ange ha some o ou oldes de ices would be he las o go.
