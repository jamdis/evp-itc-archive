<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce,

nice files. Here are my listening results:

&gt; 6_tell name_NAMES ARTHUR.wav

This one I hear as &quot;age Arthur&quot;.

Is he now also coming to you? :)

&gt; 7_lisa with you_I HEAR YOU_I HEAR VOICES.wav

Confirmed. Good relevance.

&gt; 8_speak to you_I&#x27;LL SPEAK TO YOU LATER_speak to me ok.wav

Except the &quot;l&quot; of &quot;later&quot;: confirmed. Again, good relevance.

&gt; 9_goodbye now_I ALWAYS HELPED GET WORD OUT.wav

This one was difficult for me.


Is this the original timing between your voice and the EVP responses of
the above samples, or did you delete the &quot;junk&quot; between them (as did
Margaret)?

Stefan
