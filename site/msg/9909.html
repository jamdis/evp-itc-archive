<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all,

just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I would
suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, in
order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can for
instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (including
the experimenter&#x27;s voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, but
not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP match
with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should always
be provided along with the edited version.

But that&#x27;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to express, as
we should always be able to present our results to a critical public.

&gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these files.
&gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that 
&gt; section down about 20%.  Now i can actually start to hear the message 
&gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise that 
&gt; don&#x27;t belong and eliminate them from the mix.  You can&#x27;t piece these 
&gt; files together to make something it&#x27;s not, so i keep them in true 
&gt; form pretty much to the original.

&gt;&gt; Hey Steve   Forgot to ask...how much editing was needed to get this 
&gt; file?  Did you need to take out a lot of garbage between words 
&gt; withing the message?   Ron L</pre>
