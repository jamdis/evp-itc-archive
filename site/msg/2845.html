 Well this'll go over like a fart church, I thought this was private e-mai=
l.  Ghost research, and ITC research seem to be two different things or fie=
lds, and maybe they should kept seperate. 
 
 PS I'll delete that off the g=
roup when I get home. And I'll be careful to keep my comments to myself.
