Some months ago, Stefan created an allophones files (I think it&#39;s 72 speech \n&gt; fragments based on the Speak Jet chip) to use in conjunction with his EVP Maker \nprogram.  \n&gt; Because the allophones file contains only fragments and not complete words or \nsentences \n&gt; (though to be sure, some fragments can sound like words, ie:  &quot;I&quot; &quot;ear/hear&quot; etc) there \nisn&#39;t \n&gt; an easy explanation for the responses which are produced by it ... responses that are \nnot \n&gt; only complete sentences, but relevant to the topic of the session.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think using the allophones file goes a long way in helping to rule out false positives.  I \n&gt; have actually had multiple sessions where real-time communication has taken place \nback \n&gt; and forth between myself and the person in spirit communicating via this set-up.  :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.aaevp.com/examples/sound/(c)margaret_downey2008-\n&gt; convo_with_arthur.mp3\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Leahs Odyssey &lt;leahsodyssey@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Are you talking about the computer program EVP Maker from Germany?
