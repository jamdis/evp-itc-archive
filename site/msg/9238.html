Hello Margaret,

Thanks so much for the replies.  (You replied to my previo=
us email and I forgot to thank you. )

The first EVP that I received was a =
fellow saying "Peace". Before I do an EVP session I always say a prayer and=
 use the quote used in Mark Macy's book which basically says that I would l=
ike to communicate with others who would like to see others move closer to =
God in thought, word, and deed. I always add that I would like to communica=
te with those that come in Light, Love and Peace. He has said "Peace" twice=
 now. LOL.

I have my sweet wife listen to all of them also. The second EVP=
 that I got was when I asked if there were any Spirits present. A woman, wh=
o sounded like she was in the living room said "No, no Spirits." Then you c=
ould hear her walking on our hardwood floors with hard soled shoes. I figur=
ed maybe she didn't know she was a Spirit. 

The laugh wasn't sinister. It =
just caught me off of guard. I have a Jack Russell Terrier, Molly, and I wa=
s playing with her, so it's possible that the young girl was giggling at Mo=
lly or as you said maybe because she was on the tape. During this EVP Molly=
 was just a staring at the right of us. I am sure she saw them. 

Thanks fo=
r the input. I deeply appreciate it. 

Many Blessings All,

Jeremy

Hi Jeremy. Congrats on such great=
 EVP's!! It hasn't happened often, but I have heard 
laughing on both my ow=
n recordings, and that of others, but nothing there was nothing 
sinister s=
ounding. And one time, I heard what sound like a kiss.

If the giggle sound=
 was that of a young girl, maybe she was just tickled to be talking on 
the=
 recorder? If you think about it, it's very common for children to laugh an=
d be silly 
while in the physical. Makes sense they would do that in spirit=
 as well. :-)

Again, congrats on getting clear messages so quickly. At som=
e point, you'll want to make 
sure others can hear some of them too. It's n=
ot uncommon for something to be heard 
absolutely clearly by the person doi=
ng the recording but not heard clearly (or even heard 
at all) by others. I=
 never really know how clear what I have might be until I get feedback 
fro=
m others. It's my opinion that doing EVP work can definitely increase one's=
 
clairaudience. 

Margaret
