<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have a business degree and I STILL can&#x27;t tell how our economy works in any fine detail, it&#x27;s one giant confusing mess, intentionally made confusing so the rich can get richer...  I do get the general gist, financial &quot;gurus&quot; screwed up big time using OUR money, and they&#x27;re getting bailed out at our expense so the gambling addicts on Wall Street can play another day... whether or not NK has nuclear weapons...beats me... I never believe anything I hear on the news anymore... the only thing I trust anymore is the firm knowledge that everyone in power in the world today are all a bunch of b******s corrupt beyond belief, ruthless to the core, willing to sell their own mother for instant gratification... so you can better your bottom dollar they don&#x27;t give a rat about you or me... ok I better stop now, this a ghost box forum :D ......

&gt; &gt; Last president? We don&#x27;t need no stinkin&#x27; president! Woohoo! Just kidding :)  As far as war with Iran or North Korea, I wouldn&#x27;t be in the least bit surprised if either one (or both) happened, our beloved fearmongering corporation-hugging leaders are big fans of money and violence, and you know the saying &quot;war is a racket&quot;....

&gt; &gt; &gt; The tech calling himself, David says we are going to be in another war  
&gt; &gt; &gt; soon, he says something about the next couple of months, with either North 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Korea  and/or Iran, he also says, this might be our last president for  
&gt; &gt; &gt; awhile....   :( sf

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks&#x27; Mostly I wondering if this is something that already happened, or  
&gt; &gt; &gt; if I heard it right.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank,
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; The two about the students, forward and in reverse, are both very  clear 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (and eerie).
