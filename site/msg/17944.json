DVR&#39;s get EVP. I&#39;ve gotten EVP\non the sound tracks of a video recorder. The radio and ITC seems to generate\na different class of communication. EVP-Maker is another one.\n\nProbably the method of actually producing the sound waves is different for\neach device.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Sat, Jul 10, 2010 at 8:20 AM, John S &lt;phenom_investigator@yahoo.com&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Raymond Bayless was getting recorded spirit voices back in the 1950&#39;s.\n&gt;\n&gt; While his best known work was with von Salazy on audio tape, Bayless\n&gt;\n&gt; also received voices using an early grammophone-style recording device.\n&gt;\n&gt; In other words, he was using strictly a mechanical recorder. This would\n&gt;\n&gt; suggest that the voices may not require electronics at all. And that would\n&gt;\n&gt; imply that radio signals may have nothing to do with the voice reception.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Consider too that EVPMAKER sessions seem to work well for some people.\n&gt;\n&gt; Except for the mechnical recordings, which are few in number, all the\n&gt;\n&gt; current techniques have electronics in common. So it would make sense\n&gt;\n&gt; that electronics might be important to the process. However, when\n&gt;\n&gt; you factor in the mechanical recordings made using devices prior to\n&gt;\n&gt; modern electronics, it seems more sensible to look for a common\n&gt;\n&gt; explanation which involves environmental manipulation. The most reasonable\n&gt;\n&gt; thing we know of that meets this criterion is mind-matter interaction,\n&gt;\n&gt; or psychokinesis (PK).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The only remaining question then, aside from the actual source of the\n&gt;\n&gt; information which cannot be objectively ascertained as of yet, is whether\n&gt;\n&gt; a single or multiple mechanisms are indeed at work. Even though radio waves\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; are not required to produce the phenomena, if multiple mechanisms are at\n&gt; work,\n&gt;\n&gt; it may be that radio waves are one of many ways the phenomena is produced.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bottom line, with so many options much more information is needed to form\n&gt; any\n&gt;\n&gt; reasonable hypothesis.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nMy ake on i is ha he spi i s o wha e e hey a e a e capable o using wha e e me hods a e placed in on o hem.
