I use an Olympus digital \nrecorder. I have had some luck. I was given a copy of Gold Wave recently \nand don&#39;t know the program yet. I saw that someone offered up a link to \na free tool but I could only find copies that cost.\n\nAbout three weeks ago I had a friend over. He has a pretty successful \ninvestigative team in my area. One of his members brought the &#39;Franks \nbox&#39; to show me since he knows of my interest in ITC. We didn&#39;t use it \nhowever. They had among other instruments, a K-II emf meter. Actually \nthey had about 3 meters of different types. I asked if he could use the \nbox but he said he didn&#39;t know it well enough yet to label anything \nparanormal. He did turn it on and there was a lot of noise and chatter.  \nThey did quit a few videos as well. The results were not that favorable \nwith the video but the emf showed allot of activity. We were able to \n&#39;communicate&#39; using the K-II and asking yes - no questions. I don&#39;t have \nthe evp&#39;s yet. I do have my own evp&#39;s from my apartment but not from \nthat night. I also have some from a couple cemeteries that I did. I like \ngoing out by myself which I guess is a big no no in the field of \nparanormal investigation but it hasn&#39;t bothered me much at all.\n\nI am trying to get his friend to bring the box back over. I became \ninterested in ITC about 11 years ago but never really involved myself \ninto it. Someone took a picture of me in my kitchen. When the film was \ndeveloped, a face appeared in the window behind me. There was no way a \nperson could have been outside my apartment window. I started doing some \nresearch on line and that was how I found out about ITC and evp. A few \nyears later I saw White Noise and my interest was sparked all over \nagain. I have read about the &#39;Brown box&#39; and was really excited when my \nbuddies friend brought over &#39;Franks box&#39;. With the popularity of all the \nparanormal shows and groups I have decided to concentrate on evp. I am \nnow considered an &#39;investigator in training&#39; but my interest are purely \npersonal.\n\nI am assuming that you are the &#39;Frank&#39; of my friends &#39;Frank&#39;s box&#39;. I \nwas really surprised at the coincident when I joined this evp group to \nfind out that it is your group.\n\nI hope to learn allot from this group and thanks for having me as a member.\n\nMick\n\nPS - I was considering moving to Florida but after reading all these \n&#39;bog&#39; post, I may move west.\n\nFrank Sumption wrote:\n\n&gt; This is one of the wood boxes.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Keep your kids safer online with Windows Live Family Safety.
