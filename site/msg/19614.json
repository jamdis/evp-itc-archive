I got this\n&gt; camera from my sister; years ago, she paid someone to modify it into a full\n&gt; spectrum camera (she&#39;s a photographer & wanted to do some artsy-type\n&gt; photos in full spectrum).  As to the mechanics of converting it, I think he\n&gt; basically removed the hot mirror filter that blocked the IR and UV light\n&gt; spectrums.
