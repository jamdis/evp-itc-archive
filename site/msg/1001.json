Thats been a long time ago tho. \n   \n  After saying all that you should of course check the basics, make sure everything is plugged up properly, see if anything feels extremely hot (if it is shut it down immediately to cool) then ya may wanna pop the lid off the tower of the pc to check inside and remove the sound card, clean the contacts, then replace it to see if that helps. UNPLUG IT FROM ELECTRIC FIRST! If that doesnt help then you may need to replace the part.
