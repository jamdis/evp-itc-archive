But Justin is a popular name. As I think there were two I knew with that name. They both went out that way. One I didn&#39;t know well. \n   Usually when they are stuck here there is a reason, often personal. Like unfinished business or guilt and such. Sounds like he needs help crossing over as many earthbound spirits do. But, in my experience, there are many types of spiritual encounters. Some come to visit and help.\n     I just had to reply. This stuff is certainly different. Stressful sometimes too. \nsigned,\nI forgot my name for this group. Never a dull day. Might like a day where nothing weird happened.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  The third one down they are also saying a name, what sounds like Justin, and the one where they are stuck here&quot; says also it&#39;s a sucide&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Frank Sumption purplealiengirl@...\n&gt; To: evp-itc@yahoogroups.com; RTSC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Sun, Jun 6, 2010 2:44 am\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] The car tuner.auto sweep--noise reduction--seperated [10 Attachments]\n&gt; \n&gt;                                                        [Attachment(s) from Frank Sumption included below]                       \n&gt; This i sabout as the car tuenr boxes get, at least for me, lost of noise.\n&gt;   \n&gt;   F-S\n&gt;"}
