I have my thoughts andopinions on topi=\r\ncs but feel strongly about &quot;to each his own&quot;. Unlesssomething strikes me as=\r\n completely wrong, I won&#39;t debate. No one herehas heard from me other than =\r\nrecently with this mini-box yet, I amhere several times weekly reading and =\r\noffering my energy in support ofthe research.However...something is strikin=\r\ng me here and again, I can&#39;t keep mymouth shut. The discussion about the fa=\r\nmily hour with the box has ledthe way for people to mention negativity and =\r\neven &quot;the dark guys&quot; canbe fun if not taken seriously.I ask you to consider=\r\n the fact that many who purchase the mini-boxwill not be of the right frame=\r\n of mind. Most will not be in harmony.Many will take &quot;the dark guys&quot; seriou=\r\nsly. Yet, you feel it&#39;s a goodidea to let anyone who wants a box have one? =\r\nAll in the name ofsharing technology.I know that my previous posts expressi=\r\nng my concern over the massmarketing of the box, was barely given considera=\r\ntion. Realize that Iam not being selfish- I do not own a box. EVP is my pas=\r\nsion and hasbeen from day one 6 years ago when I jumped fully into the fiel=\r\nd. I amsuccessful in capturing EVP, always have been. I still do it the &quot;ol=\r\ndfashioned way&quot; with open air techniques. Would I love to be able tohold re=\r\nal time 2 way communications with the other side? Of course.However, I do n=\r\not think enough research into the possibilities hasbeen done to warrant the=\r\n approval let alone production of these boxes. Those of us who have been on=\r\n countless investigations with many peoplewill quickly admit that there are=\r\n some people we&#39;d rather notinvestigate with. When they are present, negati=\r\nve things tend tohappen. We all know one or two people who we can say &quot;felt=\r\n dark&quot; fromthe first meeting. We all admit that being mentally sound is ani=\r\nmportant quality in this field. If you have mental issues, this maynot be t=\r\nhe area of research for you. We don&#39;t bring children oninvestigations for o=\r\nbvious reasons. BUT! If you want a box that couldpossibly open up a portal =\r\nand bridge the gap between here and thedark, sure! Anyone who wants one sho=\r\nuld have it! You might feel that I am over reacting or being overly dramati=\r\nc.That&#39;s fine. My concern is not what you think of me but that youconsider =\r\nthe possibilities here. Many of which we do not know. Can yoube 100% sure t=\r\nhat this is a good idea or that it&#39;s worthy of saying&quot;well, we&#39;ll see what =\r\nhappens&quot;? --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday&lt;paranormalinvestig=\r\nating@...&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Bill,&gt; &gt; You have the right idea, I recently have dealt=\r\n with a lot&gt; of negativity from my Frank&#39;s box.
