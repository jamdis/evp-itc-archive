http://paranormalsystems.com/New_Products.html  I listened to the 25 secon=
d sound clip, and it sounds comparable to mine, not as much noise though. I=
t is tuning across radio, and is using radio stations as the raw audio sour=
ce. The first word is 'sphinx' from the clip. I have had that image on my s=
hower window all week(Sphinx or Hotep)! The next phrase is 'Doris doesn't l=
ike your boobs' (really, I don't have em') . I'd say the thing works, and i=
t sounds good. If I had the money I would buy one. As far as for what I hea=
rd, it's been my expereince that it changes for the listener, so no doubt s=
omeone else will hear something entirely different. The point is, meaningfu=
l messages are formed out the raw audio, as this technology is intended to =
function. I would expect it to do like my version, work different for every=
 user.   Had I read more on the site I would have found that they didn't ca=
ll it a Frank's Box, and Mini Box seems an apropriate name. It has always b=
een my intention to spread this idea and information so others could experi=
ment and come up with their own version. If it means anything, I would reco=
mmend this product. A little pricy? Maybe, but if others start making this =
stuff that price should come down, it works like that for everything. How m=
any went out and bought $5000 PCs 25 years ago?   I still say you're allowe=
d to make money cuzz that makes the products available! I'm just not assert=
ive enough to charge for my stuff, plus, I just don't have the time to do p=
roduction.
