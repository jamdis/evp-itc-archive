<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am proud to announce that yesterday I became the bran new owner of 
Franks Box #12. This box was past on from one researcher to another 
and upon Bruce receiving his new Frank&#x27;s Box #29, he has willed the 
box #12 to me for research.  I have been longing for a box for 
several years now, and know that all good things come to those who 
wait.

I know this is an honor and a privilege being only the second women 
in the world to own one (that I am aware of). I am extremely greatful 
to both Bruce and Frank as well as the others on this board and hope 
that my contributions and sessions with this box can help in the 
field with our research!

The communication I got immediately when I turned it on is truly 
amazing (I will be adding files shortly marked box #12 in the file 
section).

I have started doing two types of sessions one just running the 
recorders (like Frank does) and then a separate question and answer 
session later during the day.  I know its hard trying to stop 
yourself from asking questions, but let them have their time as well, 
for the communication should not be one sided, us always wanting 
something from them to be answered.  If they want you to jump in and 
answer one of their questions, believe me they let you know (see my 
file, lets get started).

I have come to realize that many messages are missing when you jump 
the gun trying to start that immediate two way communication, or you 
start talking over them, not allowing clear audio to be received.  
Therefore, I would highly suggest trying this as well, you just may 
be surpised what you get!

Additionally, I have also observed that when tuning in the boxes, 
play close attention,they may just give you directions, you don&#x27;t 
have to have the conversation going.  They seem to want that 
communication just as bad as you do.

It is audio clips with great communication that make all of this  
time worth it. Knowing that in my heart they enjoy communicating with 
us just as much as we do them.
