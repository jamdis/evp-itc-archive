I see faces in there, as\nfor the cat one nope i dont see a cat but it is\n&quot;somethin&quot; I was more interested in the bearded man\nover to the far left of the image. I get alot of the\n&quot;somethins&quot; + bearded man in the same pics. I usually\njust say alien looking guy and bearded man hehehe\n\nThe dual/stretched face images are also similar to\nsome of the ones ive gotten over the years. \n\nI just added some new ones to the New gallery myself.\nI used ratkas imnage of his laser board and video\nrecorded it then rerecorded the video i had just\nrecorded using it as raw footage for the light source.\nHad a few good ones pop up. I dont care what the\nghosthunters or even what other researchers here think\nof my methods. I am more interested in learning more\nand expanding my mind than proving any of this is\nreal.\n\nIf they want to talk about whats real or whats not\nreal I always just jump to the &quot;what if you are all\njust a figment of my own imagination and vice versa&quot;\nwhen they can find the proof for either side of that\nbattle then we will discuss it more. hehehe \n\nGood stuff keep at it. Glad to see your having a go at\nvideo again tho I think we may need to update you and\nget you a webcam to make it easier on ya on the video\nend.\n\nMisty\n--- Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; No self respecting &quot;ghost hunter&quot; would even look at\n&gt; this, let alone consider it.
