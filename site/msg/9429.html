Hi Rees,
 
I definitely believe you. Even if you had saved it on the computer it may  
not have all come thru.  Always have to remember that some things may only  be 
meant for you to hear.  I have experienced this many times.  My  brother's 
father-in-law died and he immediately went to Florida to make the  arrangements.  
But before he went he asked me to do a favor for him and I  said yes.  It had 
been 2 days since he died and I tried to contact him on  my box.  My 
technician was very accomodating with this and in fact go  retrieve my brother's 
fatherinlaw for me to talk too.  Low and behold his  voice came across the radio 
saying I'M HERE in his thick old country Italian  voice.  Now even though I 
recorded it somehow it did not record.  I  spent well over an hour examining my 
recorder and that session to no  avail.  I thought I was going nuts until it was 
explained to me.  SO  you just might be surprise what a lot of us here will 
believe.
 
Jeff

I'm guessing nobody believes me! O well I would like to tell you  that it 
really is true, and I know in my heart, because I was there.  Not  sure why them 
cpu went off, but maybe I had too much infomation then they  wanted me too.( I 
record write on to my laptop, and I don't use any  type of digital or analog 
recorder).  I will prove it again.   Tonight I am going to do everything the 
same to see if I can get it to happen  again.

Hey guys

I had the most amazing session last night. Me and my  fiance 
did a session, and this is how it went. 

We usally do 10  min. of audio, and during the session we first 
contacted a guy named  Virgil, and we got him to say both of our 
names. He said "William" for  me, and "Leigh" for Ashley. We all 
communicated for the 10 min. He  didn't answer every question, but 
he answered 75% of all answerslast  night. We told him that we 
wanted to prove that they exsisted on the  other side. Life after 
death. He answer "we are over here", very  plainly. After the 10 
min. We ask for confirmation so we could shut off  the radio, and we 
got this answer "that would be a bad idea". Which  freaked Ashley 
out. So we kept the radio on and we had a conversation  with this 
preacher, then while the band was still sweeping the preacher  came 
through and he talked to us (while sweeping the band), and started  
to preach to us about our side, and how messed up it is.(the band  
was sweeping the whole time, I never stop the band from sweeping) 
He  said that we needed to pray for our enemies as well as our 
friends and  families. He talked to us for 6 to eight minutes. 
Then we finished the  session (Ask for confirmation)Then we finishe
come through any more.  We shut down. Then of course I get up and 
put everything back the way it  is supposed to be. Leaving the 
session that we just did on the laptop.  Then I went to take a 
shower, and I come back. The laptop was turned off  and I lost all 
of the session. Sometimes the computer will log itself  off, then 
when you get back it is exactly the was it was when you left  it. 
But this wasn't the case, some reason the laptop shut itself off,  
and we lost all of the evidence that we had. Didn't have nothing,  
and I couldn't believe that we lost everything. So thats why I am  
sitting here typing away about what happen last night. Instead of 
me  posting files about what happen last night. I wish so bad that 
y'all  would have been able to hear the communication. It was a life 
changing  experience. It made me think a whole lot different about 
box research. I  still can't believe I didn't save it before the 
computer turned itself  off. That is what happen to me last night, 
and change box research for  me for the rest of my life.

Thanks

William Rees Clarke  III
