The team planned to spend one night\nat the site to look for paranormal activity, using equipment such as\nthermal imaging cameras and voice recording systems.\n\nBrandon Cochran, museum operations assistant for the historical\nsociety, said one of the most common questions from people touring the\n153-year-old poor farm is whether it&#39;s haunted. Cochran said he had\nhoped the study would end all the speculation.\nCopyright 2008 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
