Using a test  target is =\r\none way of \nestablishing a \ntruth in time, which is the basis of this exper=\r\niment.  But there are a \ncouple of issues.\n \nIt is quite possible that some=\r\none could discern the  target through remote \nviewing alone.\nThis would neg=\r\nate the need for involvement of a spirit  communicator or \ndiscarnate entit=\r\ny.\nOutcomes depend on the word of those reporting.  The true skeptic (not \n=\r\ncynic) would \ntherefore say that this experiment contains a basic  flaw in =\r\nthat it does \nnot uniquely \nindicate that the information was obtained in t=\r\nhe  prescribed manner. \nProviding access\nto the raw audio file would not ne=\r\ncessarily constitute  proof either, since \nmany of these \ncommunications ca=\r\nn only be heard by certain people,  \n\nIf the audio file were quite clear,  =\r\ntiming  becomes an issue. In other \nwords, when was  \nthe audio actually re=\r\ncorded?  This issue can be  mitigated simply by \nrequiring any\nclaimant to =\r\nemail the audio file to a trusted party  before the test ends. \nIt would be=\r\n best \nif the trusted party were not otherwise involved in the  experiment =\r\nand it \nwas  their duty \nsimply to collect the claims. Once all claims had =\r\n been collected they \ncould be posted \npublicly for review by the community=\r\n in  general.  The experimenter could \ndecide if any \nof the claims seemed =\r\nto have hit, and this  decision could be reviewed by \nanyone if desired. \n =\r\n\nThe important detail however is that this experiment  does not completely =\r\n\nanswer the \nquestion. It is a first attempt and certainly can be  improved=\r\n on \nsuccessive trials.\n \nSuccessive trials are always a good idea, since i=\r\nt  provides replication. \nAnd it would be\n\nbest if others replicated the ex=\r\nperiment using a very  similar protocol. If \nthese were to\nsucceed, the com=\r\nmunity could then state that out of X  trials Y had \nsucceeded (by \nsome de=\r\nfinition of success) potentially giving a  success rate above that \nexpecte=\r\nd \nby random chance. This would make the outcome  quantifiable and measurea=\r\nble \nand thus meaningful.\n \nBut also important to note, this would only pro=\r\nve the  potential veracity \nof the messages.\nIt would not (and cannot as fa=\r\nr as I can tell) prove  the origin of the \nmessages. This detail\nwill, I fe=\r\nar, remain a matter for belief and  speculation for quite some \ntime to com=\r\ne.\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--part1_81d58.7b3aa30.396b53d5_boundary\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Language: en\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3DUTF-8&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Type&gt;\n&lt;M=\r\nETA name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18928&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot; id=3Drole_body   b=\r\nottomMargin=3D7 leftMargin=3D7 rightMargin=3D7 topMargin=3D7&gt;&lt;FONT id=3Drol=\r\ne_document   color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;My objectives are =\r\nenjoyment, I can hear my loved ones pretty much all the \ntime, I have the c=\r\nomfort of knowing they and we go on living.&nbsp; Plus are \npets live on to=\r\no!&nbsp; So, I guess, I am happy with that, it would be cool for \none of th=\r\ne inventors to create a more one on one type of communication piece \nwhere =\r\npeople could speak&nbsp;more&nbsp;one on one with a&nbsp;loved one at a \nti=\r\nme, kind of like a telephone, as it is now, it&#39;s more like a it being a \nco=\r\nnference &nbsp;call.&nbsp; I feel it&#39;s getting better with what has been \nc=\r\noming through so far, guess, they are working on the other side right along=\r\n \nwith us, because spirit want us to know they live on.
