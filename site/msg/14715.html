     I don't believe in trapped/lost souls, I think that's =
Hollywood. The trouble with doing investigations, I think, is you get the e=
vidence you expect to get, so it will tend to support the concept of stuck =
souls. When I record it supports my concept of sprits travel, and hauntings=
 are for show. Which is correct?--both at one time or another.

            <P>I was invited to spend the night in the West Virg=
inia 
            Penitentiary this past weekend... I was asked to give a s=
hort 
            demonstration with my Optimus 12-797 hacked radio. Deep i=
nside the 
            prison surrounded by concrete and steel, the radio c=
ould not pick up 
            any radio stations in manual mode. I wasn't s=
ure how this might 
            effect the demonstration. I was pleasantly =
surprised with the 
            results. I recorded the session and the res=
ults can be heard at this 
            link. <A title=3Dhttp://www.youtube.=
