It's an auto reversing tape deck, one that flips the heads when the tape r=
eaches the end, so you don't have to turn over the tape. You modify it so t=
he tape direction reverses, but the heads don't, so it plays backwards. The=
se are usually Walkman types, but not all can be modified.  I used old deck=
s forthe thrift store. You can alos get them from reversespeech.com

Hey Frank,Could you please elaborate on "reversing decks"? I=

eversals of the wave form, isn't it? And is it as simple as that?Thank You,=

t, to create real time voice answers to questions posed from our side. The =
most important aspect to this device is the medium operator who works as an=
 antenna or "interpreter" for living individuals asking the questions."So, =
that said (or copied and pasted) I have decided that my next attempt with t=

iable voltage used to adjust the tuning circuit, similar to the RVG mention=
ed above. I went out and purchased another older 12-470 today, to do just t=
his.(Frank... I did some measurements of that VT and found a range to work =
with.. I hope!)2) Add that white or pink noise to be mixed with the sweepin=
g raw audio already available from the modified 12-470.3) Add an internal a=
ntenna for the 12-470.4) Add an interface so the user will be a active/pass=
ive part of the radio. As mentioned above, as the antenna between the entit=
ies/spirits.So... if I can accomplish all that... maybe the little ole' 12-=
470 will be recognized by the "experts", as having what the big mahcines no=
w have... :-)Wish me luck in my adventure... and oh, by-the-way... I hope t=
