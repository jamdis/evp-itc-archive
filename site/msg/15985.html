I would definitely call that proof. The strength of the proof is in the par=
t that you knew nothing about what the message would mean to the person, or=
 if it a message for you, it was some fact that you had not known prior.

I=
MO, in this case there is no way it would be a case matrixing or hearing wh=
at you wanted or expected to hear, that it was real information conveyed th=
rough an intelligent source.
