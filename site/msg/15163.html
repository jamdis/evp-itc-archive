Thanks Bonnie. That was very informative. I has heard of this antique devic=
e years ago but not much info could be found on it. It's original purpose s=
eems to match what many of the self hypnosis tapes people still use to this=
 day try and accomplish. Since that time others have made inventions they h=
ave dubbed the psychophon(e) whos purpose is to contact spirits. I always w=
ondered about the antique one bought at the auction tho and that answered a=
ny questions I had about that device.
=A0
When I stop and think about it ju=
st creating a device that records is indeed creating the device for spirits=
 to speak on, whether living or dead. It is the original idea behind record=
ing sound that fuels our research. 
=A0
I am still=A0intrigued by a discove=
ry that predates edisons "first" recording. The "Phonautogram" which captur=
es a (visual) record of sound on paper and possibly could have been the ins=
piration for edisons work later on who knows? 
=A0
"The phonautograph etche=
d sound waves into paper covered in soot created by a burning oil lamp. Lin=
es were etched into the soot by a needle moved by a diaphragm on the device=
 that responded to sound."

Further information on the device and a reco=
rding of the sound which came from its images can be listened to here:
