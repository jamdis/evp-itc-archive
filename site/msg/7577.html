I am extremely greatful to have gotten a box and I'm more than happy to share the audio as well as doing sessions with anyone if they would like to experience one of Frank's wonderful devises.  Some of the previous owners of the boxes don't seem willing to share, or feel a need to charge you for the experience.  I think this is a terrible!!!  Frank had spent many hours building this devices, and believe this was never his intention for people to keep their experience and audio to themselves or to profit in anyway.
   
  Therefore, anyone wanting to sit in on a session is more than welcome.  Some of us here get together via Skype free internet phone, allowing an opportunity for anyone to take part and share the experience.  Just because you don't have  FB doesn't mean you can't experience and take part in great communication.  Prior to me owning one, I sat in with Steve and Bruce, allowing me an opportunity to listen to their FB's (which they both have differently unique boxes) and do my own recordings.  To them I was very greatful, and I never felt left off.  
   
  Many of us have various boxes and conduct sessions differently, this allows us additional ways to learn from each other and experience all the boxes.  
   
  If anyone is interested, please just let me know, some of you hear already can confirm these get togethers and you walk away with a greater respect for each other and spirit communication.
   
  Juli
