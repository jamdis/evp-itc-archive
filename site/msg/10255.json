Same old story over and over. \n&gt; \n&gt;  Bruce has only had a box since last fall, and just joined this group \n&gt; last year, by his own admission doen&#39;t know how the technology works, \n&gt; but will tell everyone he&#39;s the world onlyest expert! With years \n&gt; experience, while many here, to me, seem to seek the spotlight along \n&gt; with him.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  I have a site to share information on what I&#39;m doing, that way these \n&gt; clowns can continue to claim it as their own. \n&gt; \n&gt;  http://purplealiengirl.tripod.com/ \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
