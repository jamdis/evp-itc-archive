<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>One thing I can say about spirits and spirit communication after a lot
of experience - they seem to be able to selectively choose who will
get a response and who won&#x27;t. Why and how I don&#x27;t understand. But I&#x27;ve
been in a room with 6 or 7 other people who are all within a few feet
of each other trying to record EVP&#x27;s and only one gets a response.
Then 10 minutes later someone else does and the others do not.

I have also seen this with photographs. Some people will get a certain
thing on a photo and others taking a photo at the same time don&#x27;t get
anything.

I imagine it&#x27;s the same way with the box. Maybe whatever is
communicating through the box just doesn&#x27;t like some people and won&#x27;t
produce any messages for them.

&gt; @ 5 seconds &quot;Dead in Vietnam&quot; and today there was a special on History
&gt; about Vietnam war. So criticize all ya want, it still works just fine, any
&gt; failure to receive messages is in the loose nut in front of the control
&gt; panel. Point your finger at yourself when you tell how my stuff not work.
&gt; Random mode is dead mode since we==on this group--discovered linear and
&gt; manual sweep works much better. The voice recording was done by Misty, the
&gt; actual owner of the group, by manual sweep. Yeah, wonder why I ain&#x27;t
&gt; impressed by claims of superior knowledge.
