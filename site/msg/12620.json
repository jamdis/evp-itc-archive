I consider myself to be a paranormal skeptic, but I\n&gt; have heard some very interesting EVP evidence and would like to look\n&gt; into it further. I joined this group because I am interested in\n&gt; submitting EVP data to some rigorous scientific analysis. I&#39;m an\n&gt; electrical engineer and mainly work in the areas of signal processing\n&gt; and communications so all of this is extremely interesting. \n&gt; \n&gt; I am interested in collecting some of my own data (at some point) by\n&gt; building a ghost box based on Frank Sumption&#39;s designs. I am working\n&gt; from the &quot;Ghost Box Notebook&quot; from 2007, but I am having a hard time\n&gt; getting started. Has anyone built one of these and are there any\n&gt; parts lists or more complete schematics floating around? I would\n&gt; appreciate any build help or advice any of you might have.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Anna\n&gt;"}
