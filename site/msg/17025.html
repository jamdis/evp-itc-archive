Really good example of paradolia.

Notice how the 'artist' only marked the =
areas he wanted that would force it to look like a face.=C2=A0 If the artis=
t had been consistent, it's obvious there is a 3rd eye to the right.=C2=A0 =
But marking that would damage his interpretation, so he left it out.=C2=A0 =
Even a fourth eye next to the 'nostril'.=C2=A0 

And noticed how he only ma=
rked enough of the mouth to make it look like a mouth.=C2=A0 If he followed=
 the shadow, it would damage his interpretation.

And notice how he added '=
eyebrows' only ABOVE the eye, even though, again, if he was consistent, he =
would have had to mark the same image below the eyes.
