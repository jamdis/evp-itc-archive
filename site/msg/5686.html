Hey Frank,
 
A box you can see at night, what a novel thought.  Ever though=
t of  putting 
your electronics in a glow in  the dark case?  Maybe even ma=
ke  them 
multi-colored?  Now that would be something different.

Just kidding!

It's  a swept radio with amplifiers to drive a speaker wi=
th the radio 
audio,  there's mic amps to pick up the resulting audio, usua=
lly from 
a sound  chamber, then provide a line level output to a recorder,=
 and 
monitor  speaker. 

It's a method of supplying raw audio that spirits=
/entites can  use 
to form their voices, resulting in much louder EVP type =
recordings.  
and consistent spirit contacts. it's possible to get two way =
 
communication, and question/answers, although I rarely ask  questions.

I=
t was kind of an analog version of EVPmaker. After I had  many 
messages re=
layed from spirits that couldn't use the computer, I was  
thinking about w=
hat else I could use and came up with the ghost box.
