<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Rambling thoughts:

The sound quality was not as good with this batch. Lots more  
background. Did you change anything?

Okay--I am completely fascinated with who these people are who talk  
to us. I have two, both male, and god knows who they really are,  
because one has changed identity at least six times over the years,  
and one won&#x27;t tell anything at all about himself. Period. Oh, he says  
that he won&#x27;t talk through the box either. I&#x27;m tempted to add, &quot;So  
there&quot; as a direct quote. LOL. Anyway, Mike and Lisa-- So Mike says  
he bled to death in &#x27;95; Lisa choked to death in the 1920s and nuts  
to you for asking, apparently. ;)

Would you ask them some questions for me?

Ask Mike which &#x27;95 he died in--1995 or 1895?

Ask Lisa what her favorite perfume was.

Ask them both more biographical questions, such as where the were  
born, lived, and died. Their full names. Their spouses&#x27; names, kids,  
etc. I&#x27;m a historian/geneologist and I think it would be a blast to  
look in available records to try to identify them.

Ask them the year of their birth. If they tell you, there&#x27;s a lot of  
historical questions I love to ask about events within their lifetimes.
