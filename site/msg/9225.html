<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Jeremy.  Congrats on such great EVP&#x27;s!!  It hasn&#x27;t happened often, but I have heard 
laughing on both my own recordings, and that of others, but nothing there was nothing 
sinister sounding.  And one time, I heard what sound like a kiss.

If the giggle sound was that of a young girl, maybe she was just tickled to be talking on 
the recorder?  If you think about it, it&#x27;s very common for children to laugh and be silly 
while in the physical.  Makes sense they would do that in spirit as well.    :-)

Again, congrats on getting clear messages so quickly.  At some point, you&#x27;ll want to make 
sure others can hear some of them too.  It&#x27;s not uncommon for something to be heard 
absolutely clearly by the person doing the recording but not heard clearly (or even heard 
at all) by others.  I never really know how clear what I have might be until I get feedback 
from others.  It&#x27;s my opinion that doing EVP work can definitely increase one&#x27;s 
clairaudience.

&gt; Hello Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I am relatively new to this group. I have been studying about ITC
&gt; research and EVP&#x27;s for some time. I started doing EVP&#x27;s with my Sony
&gt; tape recorder about three weeks ago. So far, I have gotten many Class
&gt; A EVP&#x27;s.
&gt; 
&gt; On Sunday, I did my recording from my bedroom. I am disabled and was
&gt; in quite a bit of pain that evening. I just listened to the tape a few
&gt; minutes ago and was astounded. I can hear a good friend of mine, Jean,
&gt; that passed in 1991, calling my name as clear as a bell. Then someone
&gt; else, whispers my name loudly into the tape recorder. After that you
&gt; can hear a young girl giggle. I think it was her that whispered into
&gt; the tape recorder. 
&gt; 
&gt; I had tears of joy realizing that my good friend is trying to contact me. 
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else had Spirits laugh or giggle on an EVP. That part kind
&gt; of made me nervous.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks everyone,
&gt;
