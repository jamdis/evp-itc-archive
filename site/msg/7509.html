<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;d be cautious about long wire, and the tuner module in #12, a 
little static build and poof! You can use back to back diodes across 
the wire to help discharge voltage before it gets to high.

&gt; well now  that hill with tree  sounds perfect to have ur hubby run 
some coppper wire there and  speaker wire  #16 or #14  depends on the 
distance  and that should improve  your recption.

&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Thanks Juli!
&gt; 
&gt; I just wanted to offer a public thank you to Juli for inviting me 
&gt; into the recording group she participates in. I&#x27;m excited to join 
in 
&gt; but am experiencing some minor technical difficulties at the moment.
&gt; 
&gt; ACK! I have no radio reception! I&#x27;m out in the boonies and my house 
&gt; backs right up to a tree-covered hill. I&#x27;m going to have to find 
&gt; another private place to do my research.
&gt; 
&gt; I had to tag along on errands with hubby and son this afternoon and 
&gt; brought my RS 470 and digital recorder with me for the ride. You 
&gt; shoulda seen their reactions when I started asking the radio 
&gt; questions in the car! My son said I was scaring him (geez, he&#x27;s 
19), 
&gt; and my husband said I was like one of the bag ladies we see walking 
&gt; down the street talking to herself. They&#x27;re both disappointed in me 
&gt; for not having a more acceptable hobby like knitting. I stayed in 
&gt; the car recording when they went into the store, and then I noticed 
&gt; there was this woman in the car next to me who had been staring at 
me 
&gt; open-mouthed for God knows how long. I haven&#x27;t uploaded the 
&gt; recording to the computer yet, but really don&#x27;t think I got 
anything 
&gt; besides radio fragment.
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of that, the scan rate seems pretty fast, and yet the 
&gt; stations each hold for several seconds, so I get more like complete 
&gt; sentences than broadcast &quot;fragments.&quot; 
&gt; 
&gt; Do you think some people are chosen to be researchers in this 
field? 
&gt; I guess I&#x27;m feeling a little discouraged right now, but I&#x27;ll figure 
&gt; this out soon. 
&gt;
