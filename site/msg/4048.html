<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Interesting, but there&#x27;s a few misconceptions about my work. I used 
quartz crytals, not as part of any circuits or for frequency, some of 
the &quot;contacts&quot; request the crystals, so I place them on, or in sound 
chamber, it seems to help with some entities, as do magents used in 
the same way. There&#x27;s no way to conect them to the circuit.

 I used radio modules from car stereos because they were already 
designed to be volatage tuned, so I could use the random voltage 
generator to tune these moudules randomly. Following EVPmaker as an 
example, I had thought the tuning had to be random, as I thought 
there was somekind of quantum resonance going on to get the voices. 
That assumption has proved to be false, a linear scan is far superior 
to random scan. I don&#x27;t care what the &quot;primary tester&quot; claims, he 
doesn&#x27;t make the things. I still don&#x27;t know how the voices are made. 

 We&#x27;ve also found anyone can do the same thing as a box by manually 
tuning a radio across it&#x27;s band slowly by hand while recording. It&#x27;s 
easier to have the precess automated, but the manual method is good 
for quickie messages and guidence when needed. You wouldn&#x27;t want to 
get hooked on doing sessions to ask about every little thing in your 
life though. 

 Personally, I don&#x27;t have all these higher ideals, asperations, or 
goals as some seem to claim in the paranormal field. I don&#x27;t insist 
only the higher beings coming through with only the blessing of some 
deity--I don&#x27;t care what talks. I get some cussing and name calling --
sometimes, but big deal! It does in fact show it&#x27;s not broadcast 
fragments. As for portals some claim opened--I don&#x27;t even know what 
they are talking about, I have never experienced a portal--or 
anything that might be considered evil--except perhaps some of the 
living. I can&#x27;t imagine box use being anymore dangerous than watching 
to much TV, and taking every show as gospel truth. Wonder how many 
live their lives by what&#x27;s on Friends, or Saturday Night Live!? 90% 
or more of what I get is just my familar guys, my unseen friends, 
talking, mostly very non-profound comments. I get some relatives, my 
son, and dad, maybe an uncle from time to time, I don&#x27;t take it like 
it&#x27;s all profound and mystical, it&#x27;s just communcations--ya don&#x27;t 
have to worship it, and you don&#x27;t need some guru to interpret it! I 
don&#x27;t know how many can hear this stuff rihgt away, it might take 
practice, since the voices are composites of various voices and music 
bits mixed with radio noise. 
 The function of the box is to provide the &quot;raw&quot; audio which &quot;they&quot; 
use to form a voice. It is not the only way, there are many method 
that work as well, and at times better. 

 As far as antenna, I just use a piece of wire and an Rf amplifier, I 
don&#x27;t care about resonating for each frquency, that would be very 
cumbersome, and useless. Imagine a car with 10,000 antennas sticking 
out it! Even on ham radio I have one 100 foot long dipole I use on 
all hf bands, and talk all over the world on less than 5 watts. Of 
course I use an antenna tuner to resonate it for the band I&#x27;m on. I 
also haven&#x27;t been on the air since starting EVP, it eats all my time!

 It&#x27;s only the audio that I consider important, radio is a convenient 
source of a mix of speech, music and noise that can be chopped up 
easily by tuning. There is a program that does this on the computer, 
called EVPmaker, and my boxes were an analog version of EVPmaker. I 
am still curious why some spirits seems unable to use the computer 
method, which lead to my boxes by asking waht else could I use?
