The sell=\r\ner claimed a friend gave her the cellphone new, and she never opened the bo=\r\nx because she got another phone she liked better.  She could absolutely be =\r\ntelling the truth, but it sounded doubtful to me that she wouldn&#39;t at least=\r\n have tested it out before representing it as brand new and in perfect cond=\r\nition.  I&#39;m ashamed to admit I paid well over $200. for it after S/H, and m=\r\nuch more than that after the fruitless repairs, extra battery, etc.  I gave=\r\n her positive feedback the day it arrived because it appeared to be working=\r\n, and like I said, I simply couldn&#39;t believe anything might be wrong with i=\r\nt.  After our email exchanges and her suggestion that I contact ATT about t=\r\nhe problem, I got the feeling she had probably known all along it wasn&#39;t wo=\r\nrking right, but it was too late by that time to demand restitution, file a=\r\n complaint, or even ammend my positive feedback.  It was an extremely expen=\r\nsive lesson because I couldn&#39;t afford to buy my son the cellphone in the fi=\r\nrst place, but I DID learn!  \n\nYou know, I watched eBay sprout up literally=\r\n down the street from where I grew up in San Jose.   I&#39;ve always had great =\r\nexperiences buying stuff that way, but I can&#39;t even go to the website anymo=\r\nre because of this.
