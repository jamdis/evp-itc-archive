<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Kay.  All you have to do is plug in an external speaker, setup your computer to record 
(plug in mic, open up software and start recording - I use Audacity) turn on the radio and 
get the scan going, then start talking like you would if you were on the phone to a friend 
(but give a little extra time for them to answer).  

You can open the conversation with something like, &quot;Can you hear me?&quot; or &quot;Can anybody 
use this radio to speak to me?&quot; or you can try asking for someone specific.  

After you are done, close the conversation (again, like you might do if you were on the 
phone wrapping up the conversation with a friend), stop the recording, stop the radio, and 
go back and listen for responses.  If you think you hear something &#x27;real-time&#x27; during your 
session, repeat what you think you heard, so that interaction is recorded.  

Have fun!  Margaret

&gt; Well I went yesterday after work and picked up a RS12-469. Did the hack this afternoon 
surprising simple!! So if anyone can please help me with what else I need to get started I 
would appreciate it.  I do have some PC speakers and a small microphone to use. Not sure 
how to set it up.
&gt;    
&gt;   Thanks

&gt;             For me it was the 12-469, It has worked well with me.  I did buy a 20-125, and 
hacked it correctly, and I didn&#x27;t like it.  I also didn&#x27;t get very much reception.  The 20-125 
has a long anntena, and the 12-469 you can hold it in your hand, and you act as the 
anntena.  That way you get better reception.  Only problem with the 12-469 is that it 
clicks a little, but I can&#x27;t hear it anymore.  I train not to hear it.

&gt;         I am looking at getting either the 12-469 or 20-125. Which would be the best to 
get for someone who is just starting out. I will be doing the Hack myself with a little help 
and instructions. I want to get something fairly easy to hack and use for a beginner.
&gt;   Thanks

&gt;         Radio Shack 12-469, 20-125 then you would have to modifiy it.  Some peps here 
can tell you how to do it, or you can go to ufogeek.com, and watch a video on how to do 
it.
