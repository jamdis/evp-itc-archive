What that research has demonstrated is that there a=\r\nre \npeople who can know things they should not with no known ways of this \n=\r\nhappening. This is called &#39;anomalous information reception&#39; in Parapsycholo=\r\ngy.\nThe point is that we know this anomalous ability exists. What we do not=\r\n \nknow, from the Science, is whether discarnate entities are communicating.=\r\n\nCertainly the research mediums involved believe so, such is the nature of\n=\r\ntheir compelling experiences.
