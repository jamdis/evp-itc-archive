Seven represents the enlightened person, full special \n&gt; orientation, awareness of \n&gt; manifestation. Seven represents perfect groupings, fullness of \n&gt; planetary and angelic \n&gt; orders. Seven symbolizes perfection of order, energies and \nspiritual \n&gt; principals. Seven \n&gt; represents eternal life and the perfection of a complete cycle. It \n&gt; symbolizes a fresh start \n&gt; after a cycle has been completed and positive regeneration. Seven \nis \n&gt; the fullness of \n&gt; space and time and the fullness of the universe in motions. Through \n&gt; its hidden \n&gt; properties, the number seven maintained all things in being, \nmundane \n&gt; and spiritual, and \n&gt; bestowed life. Seven is the number of crowning achievement.\n&gt; \n&gt; A modern interpretation of the number seven affirms that you are on \n&gt; the right spiritual \n&gt; path and that what you are working on creating is very close to \n&gt; coming into being.\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This seems to make the most sense to me so far about the #7 some of \n&gt; us have been getting.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
