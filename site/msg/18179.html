Did you read the email where I said: 

"So what do the results mean? All th=
at we can really agree on from this

experiment is that no participant, wit=
h whatever theories or methods or

technology they used, was able to correc=
tly determine the object. We 
can't say

those theories or methods or techn=
ologies never work. Just as we can't 
say they

do. Just that, for whatever=
 reason, they did not work this time. Readers
 can

take the results, use t=
hem to improve or change their methods, or keep 
doing

what they're doing.=
"

So you see I have not, as you noted, said anything like "I told you so".=

Why do you continue to quote things I did not say?=C2=A0 Is Frank coaching=
 you via email? ;-)
