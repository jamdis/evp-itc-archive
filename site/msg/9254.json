I found a\n&gt; battery powered unit and now am experiencing the clicking sounds. \nCan\n&gt; anyone tell me where to find the small single speaker that was shown\n&gt; in the UFO Geeks hack? I think the batteries are causing the \nclicking.\n&gt; Oh also. I attempted to use the radio in a very active cemetary and\n&gt; the radio immediately locked on the am station 66. There was no \nsounds\n&gt; coming from it and each time I set it to search it would go back and\n&gt; lock. Did I have a hit from the other side and was too green to see \nthat?\n&gt; Thanks for any and all input, would love to get this equipment going\n&gt; in the right direction as I keep getting signs of visitations and I\n&gt; feel as if I is my grandma trying to communicate with me.\n&gt; thanks,\n&gt; Michelle\n&gt;"}
