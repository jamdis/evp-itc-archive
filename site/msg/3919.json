Lots more  \nbackground. Did you change anything?\n\nOkay--I am completely fascinated with who these people are who talk  \nto us. I have two, both male, and god knows who they really are,  \nbecause one has changed identity at least six times over the years,  \nand one won&#39;t tell anything at all about himself. Period. Oh, he says  \nthat he won&#39;t talk through the box either. I&#39;m tempted to add, &quot;So  \nthere&quot; as a direct quote. LOL. Anyway, Mike and Lisa-- So Mike says  \nhe bled to death in &#39;95; Lisa choked to death in the 1920s and nuts  \nto you for asking, apparently. ;)\n\nWould you ask them some questions for me?\n\nAsk Mike which &#39;95 he died in--1995 or 1895?\n\nAsk Lisa what her favorite perfume was.\n\nAsk them both more biographical questions, such as where the were  \nborn, lived, and died. Their full names. Their spouses&#39; names, kids,  \netc. I&#39;m a historian/geneologist and I think it would be a blast to  \nlook in available records to try to identify them.\n\nAsk them the year of their birth. If they tell you, there&#39;s a lot of  \nhistorical questions I love to ask about events within their lifetimes.\n\nAnn"}
