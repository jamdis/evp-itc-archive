It also logs all the readings on a spreadsheet.  You can also set alarms and threshholds for spikes, and well as incorporate a PC camera or audio device to record pictures, video or audio whenever your alarms are reached.  It&#39;s a very interesting device.  One of the first questions I asked it was &quot;Who are you?&quot;  It answered &quot;Edison, reincarnation&quot;.   I brought it to a meeting today of the group I belong to, the San Francisco Ghost Society, and when our resident psychic asked it &quot;What&#39;s my name?&quot;  It replied with the word &quot;Medium&quot;.  Like I said, it&#39;s a very interesting device, indeed!  The inventor refers to the device not as an ITC device, but rather, a ECM device -- for Environmental Communications Mode, as it is\n driven purely from environmental data alone.  \n   \n  Sharon\n\n\n\n    \n---------------------------------\n  Need a new ride?
