Hi Frank   I was listening to C2C a few days ago and the person being interviewed mentioned that the frequency 7.83 hertz (not MH) is the common frequency where the mind goes when it between theta and alpha states and this 7.83 frequency is sort of a trance state that links mind and universe.  Is this just woo-woo stuff?  Would you think it has any relevance to EVP communications?   waddayathink    Ron L
