If memeory serves, they mentioned these ancient\nprophecies on History&#39;s Nostradomus Effect series. These ancient pschic did\nnot have all the stupid distractions we do, like radio TV and friggin&#39; ipods\nstuck in their ears. So their psychic sense was much more active. I think\nthey studied this time--our time, the end times- in great detail. That&#39;s why\nthere are images of planes and helicopters in pyramids, scuba divers,\nsubmarines, men in space suites--and on and on.  I know, everyone knows\nbetter. I see stuff ahead of time, and my senses are pathetic. I don&#39;t know\nwhat I&#39;m seeing til I see it in real life,  I dreamed about he shuttle\nblowing the night before, but didn&#39;t know what it was til later in the day.\n\nF-S\n\nHome was an ancien g eek w i e , Sybil was he psychic o acles hey used in he way back imes.
