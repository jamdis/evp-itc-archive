Yes, the RS Hack is $24.95 (a\nhuge difference in price from the $399 for the mini). But, considering\nthe amount of work that goes into the production of the Mini (not as\nsimple as just an AM radio, quite a bit of engineering went into the\ndesign and they are hand assembled) it is more than reasonable. They\nare marked differences in performance (in my experience).\n\nI am not speaking for Frank, but I think he is pretty supportive of\nall of the new technology. It&#39;s exciting to see so many people coming\ntogether and working toward positive spirit communication.\n\nJust my two cents :-)\n\n~April"}
