that's what i do, use the head phone too, then put the radio(box) between  
the headphone, i lengthen the antenna, i put an extra piece of metal, with a 
 silver plated olive fork lol on it, i guess I'm trying to bring them in 
better,  and i record them using my pc program called "goldwave" sometimes i 
leave them  practice during the day and evening, they sometimes say stuff 
while i'm in the  middle of doing something, like cleaning, they are getting to 
be regular little  slave drivers, saying things like, "clean up"
 sometimes they ask what i'm cooking, they will tell me if one of the  
horse's gets out too, they make choices of what to watch on TV, it's strange i  
guess, i found a site that sells Silver wires for electric radios, here are 
a  few articles about silver wire:
