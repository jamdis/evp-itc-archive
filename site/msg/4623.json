I forgot to answer: No, I have not given up ghost hunting at all, but over the years I have come to focus more on the collection and distribution of experiences than on encountering phenomena myself.  ITC has really affirmed this for me.\n  I&#39;ve felt all along that my job is to make people aware that spiritual phenomena go on all the time in millions of lives; I&#39;m not a scientist and I know nothing I do will change the way science thinks.  BUT if I can open the minds of young people today, perhaps our future scientists will make it their business to figure all this out. \n  I know this is a lot of what ITC experimenters are doing: convincing others of the afterlife by their recorded evidence.  Amazing things can happen when THAT happens. \n  Again, Mark Macy is so wonderful because he has dedicated his life to this.  He and his colleagues have received such detailed descriptions of how the afterlife works, that they have helped the living change their lives to erase the fear of death--and to live in a way that brings us to as high a spiritual level as possible right away when our bodies die.  This means, for example, dealing with issues and addictions, that plague us in life, since the spirits tell us we take it all with us!  That is, death isn&#39;t a cure-all.\n  Any glimpse at the history of ITC shows us that all of this has been gradually growing since the 19th century, when state-of-the-art graphite pencils and telegraphs were used to contact the dead.  Since then, there have been &quot;breakthroughs&quot; a number of times when astounding floods of messages have come through.\n  You experimenters are all so incredible--I&#39;m amazed every day at your love, dedication and faith.  Surely something wonderful is going to come from all this, and I think it&#39;s going to come during our lifetimes.\n   \n  Ursula\n   \n   \n  \nRobin Searcy Henson &lt;MudPuddleFarm@msn.! com&gt;&lt; /i&gt; wrote:\n          Hello Bill,\n   \n  Yes, I did steal that phrase from Ursula because I thought it described what I was doing as compared to what I would like to be doing!\n   \n  I like what you said about focus on the equipment helping to establish the psychic connection.

I haven&#39;t been too active in the realm of EVP recording\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recently, but have had what I consider excellent results in the \n&gt; &gt; past\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using my little refurbished Ebay-bargain Olympus VN-120 PC.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m anxious to start recording again and am feeling pretty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overwhelmed by the technology you all seem to be using. I know a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little about using good headphones and denoiser programs, but \n&gt; &gt; beyond\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I&#39;m electronically challenged. Still, I wonder if there are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simple techniques I can experiment with to increase my success. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think I&#39;m a little bored.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve felt pretty strongly that I&#39;ve been communicating with a very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small number of entities, and I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s due to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limitations of my equipment. My most impressive EVPs have always \n&gt; &gt; been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; captured around my own home, particularly outside on the hill and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near the barn. I&#39;ve gotten two inside my house (after inviting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been negative \n&gt; &gt; messages.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;m thinking about getting another DVR and would love to \n&gt; &gt; hear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your thoughts and recommendations about which ones are best. I \n&gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like to communicate with more advanced entities eventually, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunately don&#39;t have the brain for building anything myself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &g! t; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!

I think&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the entities at my house got tired of playing with me though, and now&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; they aren&#39;t saying anything. I kind of miss them, but I do feel it&#39;s&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;g! t; &gt; time to move on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Robin&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN\n class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A title=mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com href=&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Robin,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Radio Shack now carries the Olympus VN-4100PC at about the same&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; price I&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; paid for my VN-960PC a couple years ago. I&#39;ve been very happy with&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 960. The 4100 has about\n 4 times the recording time, I think. That&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; would&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; make it about 24 hours.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Zack&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; On Sat, 29 Dec 2007, Robin Henson wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new to the group but probably know some of you from another&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; list. I haven&#39;t been too active in the realm of EVP recording&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recently, but have had what I consider excellent results in the&lt;SPAN lass=&quot;Ap&#13;&#10;ple-converted-space&quot; c!&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; past&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using my little refurbished Ebay-bargain Olympus VN-120 PC.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt; I&#39;m anxious to start recording again and am feeling pretty&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overwhelmed by the technology you all seem to be using. I know a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little about using good headphones and denoiser programs, but&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; beyond&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I&#39;m electronically challenged. Still, I wonder if there are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simple techniques I can experiment with to increase my success. I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think I&#39;m a little bored.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve felt pretty strongly that I&#39;ve been communicating with a very&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small number of entities, and I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s due to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limitations of my equipment. My most impressive EVPs have always&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; been&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; captured around my own home, particularly outside on the hill and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt; near the barn. I&#39;ve gotten two inside my house (after inviting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been negative&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; messages.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;m thinking about getting another DVR and would love to&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; hear&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your thoughts and recommendations about which ones are best. I&lt;SPAN class=Apple-converted-space&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; would&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like to communicate with more advanced entities eventually, but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunately don&#39;t have the brain for building anything myself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robin&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &amp;g! t; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
