I&#x27;ve only seen a station or control center in a dream. I was given a tour and I was floating, I could not detect that I had a body. The place looked like a combination, lab, dispatch center and control room. It was fairly crowded and there were many what I would call technicians or engineers looking at various equipment, monitoring equipment.  Frank R was interested in heterodyne messages, I got another last night.
&quot;Thanks to David heterodyne&quot;

When you say control points, are we talking real, physical places or...?

&gt; Hi Ann, I checked against the master wav file which is slightly  
&gt; clearer and I still hear it the same. Yes, the voice sounds  
&gt; distraught. In this very same session I can hear &#x27;stations&#x27; or  
&gt; control points testing, some giving locations. Yesterday I posted  
&gt; one that mentioned Amsterdam. In reviewing again today I can hear  
&gt; another message that mentions New Zealand.
&gt; &quot;Your coming through, you&#x27;ve got Southern New Zealand&quot;

&gt; I&#x27;m hearing &quot;I don&#x27;t want to go,&quot; I think. I can&#x27;t hear a D sound.
&gt; But either way, the speaker sounds horribly distraught!

&gt; &gt; Thanks Frank R. I get messages about heterodyning from time to
&gt; &gt; time. The optical microphone system I use is ultra sensitive to low
&gt; &gt; frequency vibrations. Perhaps they can use the &#x27;Schuman resonance&#x27;
&gt; &gt; as a carrier.
&gt; &gt; A couple more captures from this session. This first one is very
&gt; &gt; emotional.
&gt; &gt; &quot;I don&#x27;t really wanna die&quot;
