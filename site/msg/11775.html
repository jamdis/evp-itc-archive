&gt; Yeah (Ron) no matter the method in the end I think its all
&gt; about the tones and our perception of them as well as our
&gt; equipments ability to reproduce them. I use x-bass speakers
&gt; hooked up thru an equalizer to my pc so what I hear isnt
&gt; always what others hear on thier systems. I am more
&gt; surprised when they hear it the same as I do. When I listen
&gt; to some voices on another speaker setup sometimes the voices
&gt; tones are lost and cant hear anything, while others voice
&gt; are well recieved on any setup. I am unsure why, nor am I
&gt; sure why some days they come in clearer than others.
&gt; 
&gt; As you requested heres a couple more water files from a
&gt; recent session that I found to be very clear. I was
&gt; discussing Otto and his &quot;replacement&quot; with them
&gt; that week as well as running some experiments redoing a few
&gt; audio/visual tests I&#x27;d done in the past.
&gt; 
&gt; The session from the next day I was saying hello to my
&gt; friends who have passed and asked they wish my mother a
&gt; happy birthday for me that day. My birthday is a couple
&gt; weeks away from hers so this year I guess its a happy
&gt; birthday early (I can kinda hear early on the end of that
&gt; one how about you?)

&gt; &gt; Misty, heard pretty much of what you did.  A few
&gt; words not
&gt; &gt; clear.  I found the water method surprisingly
&gt; clear.  Full
&gt; &gt; sentence, same tone for all words.  Like to hear
&gt; more. 
&gt; &gt; Ron

&gt; &gt; Notes*
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I wish I could build robotics too LOL but dont think
