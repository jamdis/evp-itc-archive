Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] New ideas





I have a running th=
eory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly wher=
e they want it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you m=
ix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequency then if you ad=
d or subtract them together you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency=
. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an elec=
tric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will =
have a intermediate difference=C2=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within human he=
aring range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic e=
quipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From this th=
eory I always felt that EVP were generated within a few inches of the recor=
der.

We are able to reproduce this affect in not only radio with superhete=
rodyne systems but also with acoustics and audio as in some passive sonars =
and a commercial produce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii=
.

I am curious if anyone with a microphone wired =
