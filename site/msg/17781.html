<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I get this quite frequently also.  I think that the technicians facilitate
the communication with the Others.  In my experience, when I am doing a
session and I am asking questions, the Others kind of line-up to all be
heard at once.  Many times I have to ask them to only let one at a time
speak because a lot of chatter results.  I received these two clips while
ghosting on Saturday night and I think that they are directly pertinent to
this idea.

The first one you will hear is a child saying how many people are there to
speak through the box.

The second clip is a good one.  In this one you will hear my technician
reiterating my request to the Others.

&gt; It almost sounded like a transmission, where one says &quot;commence&quot;, or start
&gt; talking.

&gt;&gt; Sorry I haven&#x27;t been involved for the last week or so. I have been up to
&gt;&gt; my eyeballs in the paranormal lately and I needed a break. I am going
&gt;&gt; through the posts now and I see it was a lively week.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As for these clips Frank, the first one is exceptional. I hear it slightly
&gt;&gt; different from you. To me it sounds like: &quot;Here is Edison everyone.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Could he be announcing himself to the group who was using the box? Or was
&gt;&gt; someone introducing him?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Good stuff.
