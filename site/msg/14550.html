Your are absolutely correct. This is why us paranormal investigators throw =
out most EVP. It has to be completely clear. Clear enough that many people =
hear the same thing to be considered real proof of spirit communication. Wh=
en in doubt, we have to throw it out. In other words, it can't be a persona=
l communication, but a communication that anyone can make out.

That doesn'=
t mean that what you guys are getting isn't real communication-back to that=
 audible scrying again.

It is VERY interesting to me, as you mentioned, to=
 see what different people tend to hear. It is back to the Rorschach tests.=


From what I have gathered about you, you seem to be at least somewhat Chr=
istian, and hear Christian prayers.

  What I've noticed, is th=
at some will hear, a swear word   C...T, is what they thought that spirit s=
aid,  where, I heard two words, that is, "cut in" and it was a man's voice =
telling someone to jump in at any time, I guess he meant into the conversat=
ion, but someone I guess thought he was expressing a filthy term.  It's all=
 in what we perceive I guess, even though no one could hear my mother talk =
on Steve's first show that I heard, she did verify herself, and yes, Pink w=
as her favorite color, but I also heard her voice, when no one else did.  E=
ven in real life, people will disagree on what the hear and see, so it will=
 be difficult to develop this further. Just my take, sf
