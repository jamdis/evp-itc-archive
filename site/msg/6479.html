<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce, I will definitely ask about the name Tim and about a tech.  The
&quot;very bored&quot; part, at least if I&#x27;m hearing it correctly, proceeds as
soon and the name &quot;Tim&quot; is ending and is at a lot lower decibel level.
 Could be one of those things meant for me to hear, as in I was boring
them. It&#x27;s any body&#x27;s guess.

I got better reception as I did the session at around 8:45pm. 
Nighttime seems better for reception around here.

&gt; Jeremy,
&gt;  
&gt; I hear the &quot; TIM&quot; very clearly but not the &quot; VERY BORED&quot;
&gt;  
&gt; Tim may be your assigned technition, next session ask for
conformation about
&gt; a permanant tech and who Tim is.

&gt; Now that I&#x27;ve listened to it some more, I think I hear more stuff,
butI&#x27;m not sure what. Maybe &quot;Tim&quot; right after I ask to repeat then
the&quot;very bored&quot; and something else. Any opinions?Jeremy--- In
