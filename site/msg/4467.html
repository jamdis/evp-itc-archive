I uploaded a recording I made today 20 Dec by using EVP Maker and a recording from a Spanish language religious TV program.  After processing the sound through EVP Maker I then recorded the session by playing the sound though my computer and amplified speakers and recording with a small unidirectional mic and a small handheld digital recorder.  
   
  Sorry but I tried to cut out my questions and ramblings on the recording but it didn't happen.  I don't think I got anything on the recording but the EVP Maker noise.  Maybe someone with a trained ear can listen in a bit.  I am open to any suggestions on how to improve what I am doing.  Maybe it is better to bag it all until I fix the RS 690 that I trashed a few days ago.  ron l
