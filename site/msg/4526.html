<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My box is still saying &quot;seven&quot; over and over. Today, however, it also  
said &quot;purple&quot; twice, and &quot;Lisa&quot; at least 20 times.

Once I&#x27;m able to provide clips, I will.

&gt; The number seven seems to be coming up again.  I have attached 2  
&gt; files from a session tonight.  They clearly say &quot;Seven&quot;.  We  
&gt; proceed to ask the next question, in the second clip.  I believe it  
&gt; says &quot;happens, accident...death...to date...dead&quot;
&gt;
&gt; This is a long clip, so listen to the second question as well.
&gt;
&gt; I was wondering if any one else got something to this effect?
&gt;
&gt; Looking forward to your comments!
