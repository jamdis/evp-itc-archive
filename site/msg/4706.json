There are always going to be people who shoot \n&gt; \n&gt; it down, attack, etc., but you will find others who experiment with \n&gt; \n&gt; it, or embrace it, as well.  Nothing that is new (or old) will ever \n&gt; \n&gt; be exempt from the attack of others, unless of course one keeps it \n&gt; \n&gt; hidden in a closet.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; With this type of ITC, it is ground-breaking IMHO, as the box is \n&gt; \n&gt; providing an avenue to &quot;open up the minds&quot; of those whose time has \n&gt; \n&gt; come to &quot;hear.&quot;  In other words, I suspect that only a given amount \n&gt; \n&gt; of people will be open to it; and that will be their time to \nexplore \n&gt; \n&gt; the boxes and make contact with spirit.  That is the goal I would \n&gt; \n&gt; think: more belief by the populus and especially connection to the \n&gt; \n&gt; unseen, whatever that may be.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I just received a nasty e-mail from a TAPS lover attacking Angels & \n&gt; \n&gt; Ghosts because I have written some articles with respect to their \n&gt; \n&gt; shoddy review of the Shadow Man pic at Moundsville (I am not \ndogging \n&gt; \n&gt; TAPS here).  I simply felt what was done by the TV show to the lady \n&gt; \n&gt; who took the image was wrong.  I also was attacked as to some of \nthe \n&gt; \n&gt; EVPs on Angels & Ghosts as being &quot;faked.&quot;  We receive submissions \n&gt; \n&gt; from all over the world and post those that are of interest \n(photos, \n&gt; \n&gt; videos, evp, stories, etc).  The only goal of the site is to post \n&gt; \n&gt; that which might cause others to consider the existence of spirit - \n&gt; \n&gt; the existence of more beyond the physical realm. Of course, we \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; \n&gt; try to post that which we know was faked.  Again pointing others to \n&gt; \n&gt; connect spiritually is the idea. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Is that not what the boxes will be first used for?  I could see \nmany \n&gt; \n&gt; people split on this, but the idea of turning more toward the \n&gt; \n&gt; spiritual (whatever your definition of that is), would be a basic \n&gt; \n&gt; goal.  From there, everyone must have their own personal experience \n&gt; \n&gt; to become a believer, no matter how good the evidence posted from \n&gt; \n&gt; anyone experimenting with ITC.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; LC\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.AngelsGh osts.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, joel smith &lt;sparky1j41@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  well ihave to agree here with Bruce that blog was written from \n&gt; \n&gt; someone tthan&#39;s never seen the box or any box in action first \nhand . \n&gt; \n&gt; This is someone who has no experience what so ever in any \n&gt; \n&gt; researches  .

They quickly \n&gt; \n&gt; become disinterested and whenever anyone may mention box research \nin \n&gt; \n&gt; the future they convey the same closed minded ignorance that was \n&gt; \n&gt; spewed to them on their initial quest for answers.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Not to mention that anyone that does any serious research in \nthis \n&gt; \n&gt; medium would I&#39;m sure like to have their efforts recognised as \nbeing \n&gt; \n&gt; legitimate in their source and taken seriously with respect. not  \n&gt; \n&gt; dismissed as nonsense or something that is written off as fake or \n&gt; \n&gt; delusional. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Frank I don&#39;t want to start a long thread with all different \n&gt; \n&gt; people sniping back and forth I posted that snip it of a blog to \nlet \n&gt; \n&gt; everyone know what the general consensus of our research is. And I \n&gt; \n&gt; did not even mention who the blog was actually about but I&#39;m sure \nwe \n&gt; \n&gt; all can guess. It&#39;s that kind of stupidity that stops us from \ngetting \n&gt; \n&gt; new potential researchers involved and adding their positive energy \n&gt; \n&gt; to our own, I have received messages from our friends on the other \n&gt; \n&gt; side that instruct that the more individuals that are involved and \n&gt; \n&gt; think positively about the communication we are striving to \nachieve, \n&gt; \n&gt; the stronger the communication will get. I view this blog attitude \nas \n&gt; \n&gt; not a personal attack on what I am particularly doing but just \n&gt; \n&gt; another extremely large hurtle to get over in bringing this amazing \n&gt; \n&gt; form of spirit communication to the forefront of paranormal \nresearch.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Bruce\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- ---\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: warrior18eii@ ...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Date: Mon, 31 Dec 2007 05:18:29 -0800\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] we have a hard row to hoe\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;        Why would this be an issue?
