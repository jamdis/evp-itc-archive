I volunteer at a non profit hope center for NAMI springfield mo.Over the last 2 years have been working with the mentally ill in alternative medicine and community resources.I have come to belive that not all mentally ill people are really sick at all but instead may actually  be hearing voices that are related to evps.I belive that Franks box actually could allow those who suffer from deluisions and voices to confront and identifie discarnate entitys who have become attached to the livving.I also belive that by using franks box its possible to remove and cure the livving from these unwantted energys that plague many people around the world.In my own exsperimenting I have found that some of the voices that the mentally ill exsperiance actually have awareness outside of their victims knowledge,space and time.I have seen these voices destroy many lives that were cut short by medicines that were uneffective and offten worse then the condition whitch they were prescribed for.I wish to conduct a study using franks box in a controled exsperiment to see if this theory maybe true and if a real cure can be found to rid the livving from negative attachments that can cause and mimick mental illness in normally healthy people.Is there anyone who could help in this research.Basicly need to find a ghost box AKA Franks box that could be used for this ground breaking exsperiment.Any help would greatly be appreciated,Thank you."}
