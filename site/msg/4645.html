<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bill,

I was actually at The Stanley event held earlier this year in late 
March, when Mark Macy was there as a speaker, and where Chris Moon 
first introduced the &quot;Spirit Box&quot; with Chris Coffey.  So I didn&#x27;t 
have the good fortune of meeting Frank S. as I wasn&#x27;t at the November 
Stanley event. :(

My first exposure to the Spirit Box at The Stanley caused me to 
wonder why Chris and Chip had to interpret 90 percent of everything 
that was coming through; so in other words, it wasn&#x27;t very clear 
what, if anything, was being communicated.  It certainly gave us much 
fodder to chew on though!

I tend to view the ITC ghost/spirit boxes as akin to a kind of 
electronic Ouija board -- instead of a planchette-pointer on a board 
with letters in the alphabet to spell out answers, we&#x27;re supplying 
the spirits with radio frequencies and sound bites to rearrange and 
form into audible words.  With this in mind, one must be cautious in 
conducting experiments in one&#x27;s home because one never knows what one 
is inviting into one&#x27;s home.  

Regardless, I&#x27;m glad that we&#x27;re all trying, learning, and sharing.  
Like the early medieval alchemists, many who have risked their own 
lives (or unintentionally grew hair on the soles of their feet) by 
ingesting some of their own concoctions, we&#x27;re part of a pioneering 
group of spirit chasers that began back in the 19th century.  Because 
of lack of funding from the government in this field, I frankly don&#x27;t 
know if we&#x27;ll be able to obtain scientifically-validated proof of our 
ITC experiments in our own lifetime, but I like to think that 500 
years down the road, the people in the future will look back at what 
we&#x27;re doing today as pioneers, maybe not as charming as the early 
alchemists are portrayed in Durer woodcuts, but pioneers nonetheless.

&gt; Hey Sharon and Ann,
&gt; 
&gt; Did you meet Frank S while you were at the Stanley event in 
November?
&gt; He was in the lobby in the evenings showing and discussing his new
&gt; Box. He is so pleasant to be around, it seems like there were maybe 
a
&gt; dozen or so people that pulled up chairs to be listen to him up 
close.
&gt; 
&gt; And regarding Mark and his books, Jenneatte (my better half) and I
&gt; were at his table assisting him with book sales as his family that
&gt; normally accompanies him to these events were not there. -Bill

&gt; &gt; Not to be a downer, but I have never seen a photo taken by the  
&gt; &gt; Luminator that did not appear to me to be more than a long or  
&gt; &gt; otherwise distorted exposure (I&#x27;m very unclear of the effects  
&gt; &gt; whatever it is the device supposedly does to a camera mechanism). 
I  
&gt; &gt; wish that wasn&#x27;t the case, but until I see one of these images 
that  
&gt; &gt; convinces me otherwise, I have to be honest about it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Deb,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry to hear you were ill at The Stanley conference. I, too, 
was at
&gt; &gt; &gt; The Stanley when Mark Macy spoke there; afterwards he took 
polaroid
&gt; &gt; &gt; photos of us with the luminator. The photos were interesting; 
some
&gt; &gt; &gt; of them looked like mere double exposures, others did show what 
could
&gt; &gt; &gt; be the superimposition of another face from another dimension. 
I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; &gt; new to visual ITC, so the jury&#x27;s out on this one for now!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wow, I&#x27;m loving all this information, it&#x27;s giving me a lot of
&gt; &gt; &gt; ideas.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Very exciting for me!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does Mark Macy belong to this forum too? I met him about 3 
years
&gt; &gt; &gt; ago.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My husband is a commercial photographer and Mark asked him to 
do
&gt; &gt; &gt; his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; portrait for a book he was coming out with. He came to our 
home
&gt; &gt; &gt; studio
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the portrait, and I got to talk with him a little about 
what
&gt; &gt; &gt; he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does. At that time all I knew of EVP was from the White Noise
&gt; &gt; &gt; movie,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#x27;t sure it was real. But Mark was very nice, passionate 
about
&gt; &gt; &gt; ITC/
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EVP and very convincing. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect 
when I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; originally heard what he did, with all the loonies out there
&gt; &gt; &gt; claiming
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all kinds of stuff, but I got a really good feeling from him 
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; he&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very, well, like I said, convincing. After that I went to his 
web
&gt; &gt; &gt; site
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and also bought one of his books, which was a nice read.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I went to the Stanley Hotel in November with a ghost hunting 
group
&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mark was a speaker there. I was really looking forward to his
&gt; &gt; &gt; lecture,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but ended up with a wicked stomach virus and had to come home
&gt; &gt; &gt; early. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; missed just about everything that weekend!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oops. I forgot to answer: No, I have not given up ghost 
hunting
&gt; &gt; &gt; at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all, but over the years I have come to focus more on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; collection
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and distribution of experiences than on encountering 
phenomena
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself. ITC has really affirmed this for me.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve felt all along that my job is to make people aware that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual phenomena go on all the time in millions of 
lives; I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a scientist and I know nothing I do will change the way 
science
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinks. BUT if I can open the minds of young people today,
&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our future scientists will make it their business to figure 
all
&gt; &gt; &gt; this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know this is a lot of what ITC experimenters are doing:
&gt; &gt; &gt; convincing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others of the afterlife by their recorded evidence. Amazing
&gt; &gt; &gt; things
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can happen when THAT happens.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, Mark Macy is so wonderful because he has dedicated 
his
&gt; &gt; &gt; life
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to this. He and his colleagues have received such detailed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; descriptions of how the afterlife works, that they have 
helped
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; living change their lives to erase the fear of death--and 
to live
&gt; &gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a way that brings us to as high a spiritual level as 
possible
&gt; &gt; &gt; right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away when our bodies die. This means, for example, dealing 
with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issues and addictions, that plague us in life, since the 
spirits
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tell us we take it all with us! That is, death isn&#x27;t a cure-
all.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any glimpse at the history of ITC shows us that all of this 
has
&gt; &gt; &gt; been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gradually growing since the 19th century, when state-of-the-
art
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; graphite pencils and telegraphs were used to contact the 
dead.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since then, there have been &quot;breakthroughs&quot; a number of 
times
&gt; &gt; &gt; when
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; astounding floods of messages have come through.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You experimenters are all so incredible--I&#x27;m amazed every 
day at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your love, dedication and faith. Surely something wonderful 
is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to come from all this, and I think it&#x27;s going to come
&gt; &gt; &gt; during
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our lifetimes.

This

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are as important as physical ones.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Robin,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your phrase of &quot;ritualized vs. random&quot; is interesting. 
There
&gt; &gt; &gt; are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who believe that communication is between the conscious 
of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; researcher and the entity and the equipment is secondary. 
It&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get swept up in the technology and forget there is 
possibly a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; psychic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connection going on. With that said, focusing on equipment
&gt; &gt; &gt; actually
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can help the researcher become receptive to establishing a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication link. While paying attention to the 
equipment,
&gt; &gt; &gt; we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forget
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about the daily distractions and minor irritations that 
may
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prevent us
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from establishing contact.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The setting up the gear we use could be considered the 
first
&gt; &gt; &gt; part of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;ritual&quot;. I like to clear my mind, set up equipment, 
mess
&gt; &gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some more, then I am mentally prepare to begin what I 
hope will
&gt; &gt; &gt; be a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; successful session.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess &quot;random&quot; recording to me would be what happens in 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; field
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; during a paranormal investigation. I don&#x27;t bring Box
&gt; &gt; &gt; technology
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; location with the intention of possibly contacting 
lingering
&gt; &gt; &gt; spirits
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at that location but I do bring audio recorders in hopes 
of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recording
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evp&#x27;s.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I find the Box works perhaps even better when I&#x27;m in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; familiar
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; place
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like the room in my home that is designated for that 
purpose. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire to have the finest Box technology that is possible 
but
&gt; &gt; &gt; more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important is the association that seems to occur between 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; researcher and the Box that is favored. Despite some of 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; benefits
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the new gear, the one that I seem to have a connection 
with
&gt; &gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that requires a little more finesse to operate. -Bill

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wouldn&#x27;t mind upgrading a bit.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Frank! I basically follow your suggestion when 
recording,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I learned to be quiet I actually started getting

&gt; &gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the entities at my house got tired of playing with me

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the

&gt; &gt; &gt; think.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I&#x27;m electronically challenged. Still, I wonder 
if
&gt; &gt; &gt; there
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simple techniques I can experiment with to increase 
my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; success. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think I&#x27;m a little bored.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve felt pretty strongly that I&#x27;ve been 
communicating
&gt; &gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a very
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small number of entities, and I&#x27;m wondering if 
that&#x27;s due
&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limitations of my equipment. My most impressive EVPs
&gt; &gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; captured around my own home, particularly outside 
on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hill and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near the barn. I&#x27;ve gotten two inside my house 
(after
&gt; &gt; &gt; inviting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been 
negative
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messages.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#x27;m thinking about getting another DVR and 
would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your thoughts and recommendations about which ones 
are
&gt; &gt; &gt; best. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like to communicate with more advanced entities
&gt; &gt; &gt; eventually,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunately don&#x27;t have the brain for building 
anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!
