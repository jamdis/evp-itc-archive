<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>the isuue of touch goes to the narrowness of optimum bandwidth


it takes brains , youth, and steady nerves to solve that problem

you dont have to; i already did it.


incidentally the british guy on franks most recent one is a regular.  
his voice is highly distinctive and he tends to show up when people 
start getting serious.  you are to the state-of-art where you should 
expect to get voices of living persons too.  also cryptic comments from 
erudite, hypereducated types who are in fact , a subculture of advanced 
humans who have a very low opinion of the rest of us.


the narrowness of the tuning is so fantastic that the best way for 
unskilled person to noyice that &quot;something&quot; is there is by daves linear 
sweep.  forget about shannons info theory; full, hi-fi can be obtained 
thru a very narrow 10hz channel.  this is by internal bending of 
photons, which has been underpinned by orthodoxy only in the last few 
weeks; 2 slit experiment has been seriously modified.

TOUCH OR NON-YOUCH?

its non-touch-- the observer has no effect whatsoever.

BUT   adjustments are different and must be agonizingly exact, moving 
tiny wires a millimeter with an acrylic rod 10 ft long.

for practical matters, at present, KEEP THE TOUCH PLATE IN, makes 
routine tuning easier.


for the future:  only permeability, inductive, magnet tuning can be made 
high enough in Q.  Q must be derived from REACTION ; merely inserting 
30000 Q crystal does absolutely nothing. 

good example of mutual inductance of two critically coupled coils.
for etheric radio, this is grossly overcoupled.  only way to critically 
couple etheric is to bring coils to normal critical coupling the 
GRADUALLY  separate them a little more.  this can take DAYS.  the 
atmosphere space-time fabric around receiver has to be gradually 
conditioned.

more later if you want. and only if you want.  i dont have extra breath 
to waste.

your fellow purple fan,
