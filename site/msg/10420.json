Its&#39; either all ego--I&#39;m the only=\r\nest one that can use this, or like the more recent example. I don&#39;t know if=\r\n these people were like this to start, or if it&#39;s an external influance, bu=\r\nt it&#39;s discouraging. There seems to be a similar reaction with systems not =\r\nmade by me--so I&#39;ve been told.\n \n Soooo, maybe burn some white candles, and=\r\n maybe get a Rosary.
