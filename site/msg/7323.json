They were investigating\nan old insane asylum, and they had Chris Moon as a guest investigator\nwith the box.  You can see the promo clip here:\n\nhttp://www.pennstateprs.com/ps_asylum.mov\n\nHere&#39;s the site for the show itself:\n\nhttp://www.aetv.com/paranormal-state/index.jsp\n\nFor those not familiar, its a half hour show that follows along the\n&quot;Penn State Paranormal Research Society&quot; and different cases they take\non.  Their niche in the &quot;paranormal reality tv show&quot; market is that\nthe group&#39;s leader follows a more Christian orientated skew on\nhappenings.  Lots of &quot;demons&quot; (they have Lorraine Warren guest all the\ntime), and they usually try to do investigations/communication only\nduring what they call &quot;dead time&quot;, 3am-4am, or &quot;the polar opposite of\n3pm - the time Jesus gave is life for all mankind&quot; as they put it. Oh,\nand they have an &quot;occult specialist&quot; on the team that so far has been\nanything but.\n\nOn the positive side, they did actually get (and record for later\nanalysis) live communication on the box in response to questions being\nasked.  And on the analysis and isolation of the recorded parts, you\ncould actually hear what was being said (as opposed to the usual of\nChris acting as a go-between for very distorted sounds like on those\nyoutube videos).  So it was good to see it a)working in the &quot;field&quot;\nand b)get some exposure on a tv show.\n\n\nMarty"}
