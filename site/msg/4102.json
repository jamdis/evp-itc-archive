For one thing I was afraid of ridicule, and another is this \neats all of my &quot;spare&quot; time. I mentioned EVP to one of QRP club guys \nand he never spoke to me agian. I thinkit&#39;s time to try to set up \nsome nets.\n\n Frank-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Greetings Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am also a fellow &quot;licensed Ham Radio Operator&quot; and have been told \n&gt; by others that I am a &quot;Sensitive&quot;, which would explain much that \nhas \n&gt; happened in my life.\n&gt; On the subject of licensed operators, I&#39;m guessing there may be \nmany \n&gt; of us &quot;Hams&quot; who enjoy searching and exploring the world of heard & \n&gt; unheard frequencies. It is one that is wide open at the moment. \nThat \n&gt; is why we enjoy finding and experimenting with new techniques, \n&gt; devices, and ideas. We number many more than thirty, and there&#39;s \nroom \n&gt; for plenty more... Welcome to the group!\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; -----\n&gt; All my Radio Shack Hack videos can be found at:\n&gt; http://www.ufogeek.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ken&quot; &lt;ktm@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Greetings All,  My name is Ken & I&#39;ve been reading the group for \na \n&gt; few days now.\n&gt; &gt; I have some observations & a couple of ideas I&#39;d like to share:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It amazes me how like minded intentions attract the same.\n&gt; &gt; Like Rick Moran, Frank, & Ron.  I too am a licensed Ham Radio \n&gt; Operator and \n&gt; &gt; am very interested in EVP,etc.  I&#39;m also a Remote Viewer, \n&gt; Sensitive, & dowser.\n&gt; &gt; My studies have taught me that these things basically work on the \n&gt; same principles.\n&gt; &gt; In Physics there&#39;s something called Quantum entanglement.  In a \n&gt; nutshell, Its the \n&gt; &gt; idea of all things being familiar & related due to their physical \n&gt; make up.  Like identical \n&gt; &gt; twins separated at birth, all things are connected and aware of \none \n&gt; another, even though\n&gt; &gt; miles apart & separated for years.  Also, just as time & space \n&gt; exists in a vacuum, all\n&gt; &gt; things live forever.  Once a word is spoken or an attitude is \nacted \n&gt; out its effects can be \n&gt; &gt; witnessed forever, (Like dropping a pebble in water & watching \nthe \n&gt; ripples).  When I was \n&gt; &gt; teen I overdosed on some chemically treated weed.  I had an OBE & \n&gt; saw the tunnel of \n&gt; &gt; white light thing, had the whole experience.  Ever since then \nI&#39;ve \n&gt; understood that we are \n&gt; &gt; multidimensional, nothing dies, it only evolves or changes energy \n&gt; forms.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; People will always shy away from & fear that which they don&#39;t \n&gt; understand.  \n&gt; &gt; They try to label things as evil, good, right, & wrong.  Things \nare \n&gt; relative.\n&gt; &gt; Your intentions are what makes things what they are.  You will \n&gt; always find\n&gt; &gt; what you look for.  Keep up the good work, its all very \ninteresting.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
