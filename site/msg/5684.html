LC, that was beautifully stated, and you are so RIGHT.

  Robin:

  From my perspectiv=
e your first sentence is key in summing up the 
  various viewpoints from p=
eople...the word "believe" stands out. You 
  posted, "I'm still giving thi=
s topic a lot of thought because I 
  absolutely BELIEVE in the power of pr=
ayer, the power of positivity, 
  and the power of ritual." 

  Belief... I=
 think whatever works to keep a person from fear is the 
  ticket. Fear is =
when we hand power over to something else and become 
  its slave. Your pos=
t states that you "absolutely believe" - that is 
  your power, mentally us=
ed by you to not succumb to fear, and thus 
  remain in control. ;)

  I mi=
ght further point out that there is something more powerful than 
  belief =
in my opinion, and that has been the reason behind my 
  pursuits. I sugges=
t that what a person KNOWS as truth is even better 
  than belief. Truth is=
 eternal and has no opposite.
