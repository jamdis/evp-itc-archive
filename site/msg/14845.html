&gt;  And yet, he wonders why he&#x27;s banned from this group. Duffus just does not
&gt; get it!
&gt; 
&gt;  Yeah, I forgot, guys like that have nothing to do all day but scan the
&gt; other groups to see who&#x27;s talking about them.
&gt; 
&gt;  Should I forward his response?

&gt; &gt;    There is no need for spies on this board, when you made it you made it
&gt; &gt; viewable to the world. Dont have to be a member to  read whats posted here
&gt; &gt; in archives (which is packed full of all sorts of information including this
&gt; &gt; subject), only have to be a member to add to the discussions. Nobody has to
&gt; &gt; forward him anything he can take the time to read for himself.

&gt; &gt;   Frank,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Someone, and I think I know who, is forwarding posts. If I find out for
&gt; &gt; sure who it is, I&#x27;ll recommend you get banned.  Obviously this idiot knows
&gt; &gt; what he&#x27;s guilty of, and assumes I meant him. Maybe this person should just
&gt; &gt; be banned anyway.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Frank-S
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &quot;Do me a favor, stop letting Chris Moon put his words into your mouth. The
&gt; &gt; things you accused who we all know is me in your post #14829 and #14832 are
&gt; &gt; the same pathetic things moon said when I exposed him on his own radio show
&gt; &gt; a while back.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Frank don&#x27;t lower yourself to his level and don&#x27;t let him manipulate you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Stop letting him talk you into slandering other people with unsubstantiated
&gt; &gt; claims. Frank I am not saying this out of anger but he is pushing you to do
&gt; &gt; things because he is not man enough to do them himself!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Tell him that I will produce the coinciding raw file for any posted file I
&gt; &gt; have, see if he can do the same. Let this be the last time I have to write
&gt; &gt; you I am asking politely..
&gt; &gt;
