The only thing that seperat=\r\nes them is frequency and power. Radio waves are radio waves because they oc=\r\ncupy a certain block of the electromagnietic spectrum. Sound waves exist on=\r\n that same spectrum just farther down with much longer waves. Soundwaves an=\r\nd subsonic waves can penetrate almost anything because of their wavelengths=\r\n. The shorter the wavelength the more ways we can shield against them.\n\n   =\r\n               Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and tele=\r\nmetry transmitting wave but the waves also have a physical effect on our en=\r\nvironment by causing molecules to speed up, which creates heat. A little lo=\r\nwer than this is IR or infrared it too can cause physical objects to heat u=\r\np but usually it just causes molecules to rotate in place. All physical thi=\r\nngs give off IR light. Its a way the total system conserves energy by spont=\r\naneously emitting IR radiation.\n\n                  Frank R.\n\n              =\r\n    --- On Mon, 6/8/09, April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch.=\r\n com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n                    From: April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercromb=\r\niegh ostresearch. com&gt;\n                    Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] New ideas=\r\n [3 Attachments]\n                    To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n         =\r\n           Date: Monday, June 8, 2009, 2:27 PM\n\n\n                    Here i=\r\ns some food for thought. I am currently reviewing my audio from our May 30t=\r\nh investigation.\n\n                    It was me and another girl teammate p=\r\nresent in the room. I picked up a 3rd female voice on my digital voice reco=\r\nrder that I carry with me. We were standing right next to another digital v=\r\nideo recorder that I leave beside my night vision camera. That recorder did=\r\n not pick up this 3rd voice. I have asked the girl that was with me to chec=\r\nk her recording to see if she picked it up.\n\n                    I have lon=\r\ng felt the true EVP does not come from sound waves in the environment, or t=\r\nhen it wouldn&#39;t be EVP, but a disembodied voice. Somehow EVP&#39;s are appearin=\r\ng directly on the recordings.\n\n                    This instance with the r=\r\necorders may back that theory up. That other recorder should have picked th=\r\nat voice up if it were sound waves in the environment.\n\n                   =\r\n I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. The file that is named &quot;01-02-1=\r\n7 Clip&quot; is the full clip. You will hear my voice as I say &quot;Yeah&quot;, and then =\r\nanother comes in right after that. I think I know what it says.\n\n          =\r\n          Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but still did not hear thi=\r\ns until playback. It isn&#39;t clear, so I am not as excited about it as my one=\r\n&#39;s from the last investigation.\n\n\n                      ----- Original Mess=\r\nage ----- \n                      From: Frank Ratka \n                      T=\r\no: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com \n                      Sent: Monday, June 08, 2=\r\n009 1:09 PM\n                      Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] New ideas\n\n\n      =\r\n                      I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an unt=\r\nrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It wor=\r\nks off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that diffe=\r\nr one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them together you ge=\r\nt a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is sendi=\r\nng a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating an unt=\r\nrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate difference fre=\r\nquency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was j=\r\nust an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic signals j=\r\nust by turning them on.

Radio waves are radio \n                  waves because they o=\r\nccupy a certain block of the \n                  electromagnietic spectrum. =\r\nSound waves exist on that same \n                  spectrum just farther dow=\r\nn with much longer waves. Soundwaves \n                  and subsonic waves =\r\ncan penetrate almost anything because of \n                  their wavelengt=\r\nhs. The shorter the wavelength the more ways we \n                  can shie=\r\nld against them.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                =\r\n  &lt;DIV&gt;Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and \n           =\r\n       telemetry transmitting wave but the waves also have a physical \n    =\r\n              effect on our environment by causing molecules to speed up, \n=\r\n                  which creates heat. A little lower than this is IR or inf=\r\nrared \n                  it too can cause physical objects to heat up but u=\r\nsually it \n                  just causes molecules to rotate in place. All =\r\nphysical things \n                  give off IR light. Its a way the total s=\r\nystem conserves energy \n                  by spontaneously emitting IR radi=\r\nation.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                  &lt;DIV&gt;Fra=\r\nnk R.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Mon, 6/8/09, April Abercrombie \n                  &lt;I=\r\n&gt;&lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; \n                  wr=\r\note:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE \n                    style=3D&quot;=\r\nBORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: \n                    April=\r\n Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch. \n                    com&=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] New ideas [3 \n                    Attachments=\r\n]&lt;BR&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;BR&gt;Date: \n                    Monday, Jun=\r\ne 8, 2009, 2:27 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n                    &lt;DIV id=3Dyiv271114382&gt;\n    =\r\n                &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n                    &lt;DIV&gt;\n            =\r\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;Here is some food for \n    =\r\n                thought.

It works off the \n                        =\r\n    heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic \n                      =\r\n      waves that differ one another in frequency then if \n                 =\r\n           you add or subtract them together you get a beat \n              =\r\n              frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a \n        =\r\n                    ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an \n   =\r\n                         electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic \n   =\r\n                         frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermedia=\r\nte \n                            difference&nbsp;frequency at 9KHz, well wit=\r\nhin human \n                            hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This =\r\nwas just an \n                            example, but all electronic equipm=\r\nent generates \n                            ultrasonic signals just by turni=\r\nng them on.
