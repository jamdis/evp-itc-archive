There's nothing like your box Frank, and I am honored to have one with your blessings!  It it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be getting an opportunity for this communication, so thank you from the bottom of my heart.  
   
  I have come to realize that I don't think that we choose the boxes, the boxes choose us, and for every adventure you take the results get better and better.
