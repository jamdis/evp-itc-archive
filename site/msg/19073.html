&gt; Did a quick test of a box during my radio show tonight and received this file. Kristin picked this up right away, but it was hard for me to hear with the headphones on. It seems that they say &quot;Steve Hultay&quot;, let me know if anybody else hears this.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember, this was recorded live tonight during my radio show with no editing involved.
