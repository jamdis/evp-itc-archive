Welcome to the group. 
   
  Sure I can repost for you. Deciding on which one to post...well thats the hard part LOL since I have had some newer ones that some may find easier to hear.
   
  Glad to hear you are interested in ITC. It is a fascinating subject. Perhaps you could tell me a little about what got you interested in it or any experiences you have had with it.
   
  I enjoy both the voice and image aspects of it. During the last year I have probably collected over 1000 sound bits and hundreds of images. I never ask anyone to believe me or any of my evidence, only that they look into it for themselves reguardless of what they think of my personal stuff.
   
  So everyone feel free to share and comment. Feedback is always good, it helps us and it helps "them" too. In the meantime I will repost a couple things for you including a few "welcome" introduction files from them to start/end our sessions. 
   
  Hope you can hear them. Enjoy!
   
  Misty
   
   
   
  Hi Misty,
I just switched my acct over to receive email from this group in my 
email inbox. Sorry for the inconvenience, but could you re-post what 
you feel is the best evp from your most recent batch for me to hear? 
By the way, this is my first post here. Joined up a couple of weeks 
ago but didn't have the time until now to post anything here. Found 
this group after doing a search for ITC groups... thanks :)
