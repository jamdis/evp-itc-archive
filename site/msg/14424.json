I&#39;m sure they would want to &quot;tell&quot; us where they were, and how they reach us instead of doing the AMAZING trumpet playing :) Voicing back then would be expected to have these answers...it was easier to draw paying customers with just &quot;tricks&quot;. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey there, stop that April, hehe, way back spirit use to materialize vocal  \n&gt; cords, if given enough ectoplasm and they could speak out in mid air, or \n&gt; use a  metal trumpet like thing, I have an old banged up one, im going to use \n&gt; it today  with the RS 125, and see what happens, put it inside the lower end \n&gt; of the  trumpet, with the mic, near the PC and let them talk away, the PC \n&gt; does the  recording, it might help them, who knows until it&#39;s tried.  they \n&gt; use to  form cords inside the trumpet out of this substance  called  ectoplasm \n&gt; and talk independently like that one time.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; In a message dated 5/19/2009 2:50:36 P.M.

Don&#39;t see how a \n&gt; crystal helps, it&#39;s just glass, and there is no where for  them to create \n&gt; ectoplasm like threads on glass, try two tiny wires, (I see  u, stop laughing).\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; In a message dated 5/19/2009 2:20:31 P.M.

Perhaps, you should set up a  test, try asking something of the \n&gt; spirit that you do not know, where it  could be verified later, that way it won&#39;t \n&gt; have any physical  influence.  I remember voices easily, it&#39;s the work I \n&gt; do, so I do  recognize my mother&#39;s voice, I do think you are all onto some \n&gt; thing  here, which should one day be as the air plane, who every thought humans \n&gt;  would one day fly?  Try some light weight metal object in the box,  maybe \n&gt; it would help, maybe shaped like a pair of vocal cords, with  folds see it \n&gt; that helps. sf  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; In a message dated 5/19/2009 10:39:32 A.M.

Thoughts can interact with the  electronics, and even \n&gt; &quot;voices&quot; of the living can come through, in that  way I think we can create what \n&gt; we are expecting to hear. \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; When I first started making this stuff, I gort my wifes  &quot;voice&quot; as she was \n&gt; stepping in the shower, upstairs, &quot;I&#39;ll be out in  two minutes&quot;, in her \n&gt; voces, throught he box. It&#39;s seems to be more  difficult to conciously form \n&gt; voices, kinda like doing PK, it&#39;s more of  a subconcious function. Of course \n&gt; that was with the radnom sweep,  linear sweep seems to work a little \n&gt; differently, and seems to take  more ability, or effort. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  The voices seem to made inside the electronics, you can  record with no \n&gt; sound output, and still get the same kind of results.  Even that could support \n&gt; that suggestion that it&#39;s imagination, in that  we&#39;d still hear the same \n&gt; stuff in the chopped up audio, not that I  believe that. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Someone needs to study this stuff that hasn&#39;t already made  up their minds \n&gt; what it is.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, May 18, 2009 at 3:27 PM, &lt;_SnowfireL@..._ \n&gt; (mailto:SnowfireL@...) &gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi, I have a question for those who use a box instead of radio,  where do \n&gt; spirit get the ability to talk with a box?
