<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Jeremy.  Did you ever see the video on YouTube?  I&#x27;m not finding it at the moment, but 
they video&#x27;d one of the sessions.  It was quite interesting, but I don&#x27;t remember which 
researcher (it was a man) that was conducting the session.

&gt; The communication was done not via radio, but telephone directly to
&gt; the researchers homes. There were numerous telephone calls made to
&gt; Maggy Harsch-Fishbach, Mark Macy and even to Sarah Estep. These phone
&gt; calls were made by members of the group on the Other Side working with
&gt; ITC researchers during the 1990&#x27;s. The group working with the ITC
&gt; researchers were guided by seven Ethereal beings on the Other Side
&gt; called The Seven. Contact was not only made via telephone, but also
&gt; fax and files placed in Maggy Fishbach&#x27;s computer. :)
&gt; 
&gt; I highly recommend Mr. Macy&#x27;s book, Miracles In The Storm. He has much
&gt; of this information on his website. http://worlditc.org
&gt; 
&gt; Many Blessings All,

&gt; &gt; And were using Hacked Radios to talk to the dead! I am not sure I 
&gt; &gt; believe that one.

&gt; &gt; &gt; That is the phone call made to Mark Macy by Konstantin Raudive. Mr. 
&gt; &gt; Macy talked about this phone call in his excellent book &quot;Miracles In 
&gt; &gt; The Storm.&quot;
