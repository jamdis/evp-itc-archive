&gt; Bruce says, they were just using a radio box, like an RS 120-150 to get  
&gt; that it just wasn&#x27;t in the picture, that gal on the video says, she puts  
&gt; aluminum foil on the top to block out some noise, and only allow the closer  
&gt; spirits to come through, I guess it limits them from talking too much or  
&gt; something. sf

&gt; Don&#x27;t  the voices on that video sound a bit &quot;scrubbed&quot;?  There&#x27;s not a lot 
&gt; of  click-click or background noise ... sounds too good to be true.
&gt; 
&gt; With a  price tag of nearly $300, I would need to hear a pretty convincing 
&gt; testimonial  before I would shell out quite that much cash.   What do you  
&gt; think?
