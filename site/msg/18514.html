 "it hits the earth" again last night while testing one of those single sup=
ply dual sweep boxes, so set up a hack radio I had handy. "--BehindTheSun--=

--Comet-Good(?)". The jack thing is Jack FM, 105.5 FM a rock station. Presu=
mable 2012. The December 21st date from the Mayans seems to be a middl=
e number, there's like a window right around Christmas, as they seem to men=
tion the 17th along with this stuff. Who knows if it means anything, but wh=
