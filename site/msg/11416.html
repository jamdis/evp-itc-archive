<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have my boxes with AM/FM, and sometimes short wave for audio,. then 
you can even a[pply the seweep technique to TV and get &quot;interesting&quot; 
images, such as the one on the home page here. With TV going HD, I 
haven&#x27;t spent much time onthe video systems though. 

 I did make a printed circuit board for linear sweep with the audio 
amplifiers, and another board for Ranom sweep. The only problem, the 
stuff remains so time consumming to put together. I&#x27;m also having 
trouble coming up with a suitable, and cheap cabinet for the 
electronics, for some tuners, you need a none metalic enclosure. 

 Unfortunate that all attempts at mass productions are seemingly 
blocked.

 An all ways EVP device might be a bit heavy to carry around, but it 
could be done.

&gt; This is my first post. I was wondering if anyone had created an all 
in
&gt; one ITC EVP device. I know that researchers such as Seidle had 
created
&gt; the psychophone that seemed to cover many aspects of ITC but I have
&gt; yet to see all ways of communication in one device.
&gt; 
&gt; I have created an all in one design that covers most of the devices
&gt; used. If you wish I will share the design.
