  Hi=
ya Bill

  Ohh h2o. The water method. Recording water "noise" is how I got =
my first evp (i suppose) and has always been my base method, the one I retu=
rn to. The fish tank in the room pumps water continuously thru the filter a=
nd makes a small waterfall effect. The first evp was my mothers voice, a ha=
ppy/insane accident, the rest have been on purpose recordings.

  I try alo=
t of different methods, so far all are capable of yielding results but for =
my ears some methods are capable of better human voice quality tones, and l=
onger sentence clarity. There is no perfect method. I dont think there is m=
eant to be a "perfect" method. If we knew everything there was to know, the=
n what is there left to learn about hehehe

  Most have success with the wa=
ter method, give it a try sometime. You can use the fishtank (if you have o=
ne) pump/filter from the other side of a room as background noise, or you c=
an record while the shower runs, or the sink runs. Dont record too close to=
 the bg sound source. In this room I am about 14 feet away from the tank an=
d I set my mics volume to 1/2 sound volume (thats 5 in audacity). Laura K. =
recorded her pool and a fountain in her house and had some good results. Fr=
ank R. also had success using this method. Charli's coffeepot had a similar=
 effect. It pumped the water thru a charcoal filter and they could hear voi=
ces emitting thru the noise.

  It's interesting to me that some of the sam=
e voices carry over no matter what method. Harsh noise, soft noise, no nois=
e.... they still talk. Whether everyone hears them or not LOL

  Test it ou=
t =3D) The p1 filter for clearvoice was made for h2o, it does raise the lev=
el of thier voices and clear up some of the static noise for me so I dont g=
et a headache listening. Use whatever works best for you.

can hear that. Interesting it was at the -75% because most of
