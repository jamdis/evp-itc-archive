I think I can help on the Queen Mary stuff. The late Peter James actually=

became well-known because he facilitated the production of the audible
voi=
ce of the little girl known to him (and the rest of the world) as "Jackie."=

This recording, not an EVP, became for many clear evidence that the 
littl=
e girl was quite real. Many people, including some known personally
to me, =
claim to have seen this little girl and others in the First Class Pool
area=
. This story goes back many years before Disney had anything to do
with the=
 Queen Mary, so I think it is correct to say that myth is wrong.

=C2=A0 Yeah, that was from me(Frank). Yeah that helps, at=
 least you're not just
some brainiac debunker that knows it all cuz he says=
 so.

Anyway, I find it very difficult to get absolutes with this work, as =
the
mind has a hell of lot to do with it. An example, I started out using a=

randiom voltage to sweep the radios becuase I was using EVPmaker previous =
to
making boxes, and EVPmaker uses a method of chopping up the raw audio, a=
nd
playing it back for use by the enities. When I first swtiched to a linea=
r
sweep all I couyld hear was gibberish, then very suddenly I hear hear "th=
em"
talking on my fisrt linear sweep box. So did it take "them" time to ada=
pt,
or did it take my brain to make sense out of the gibberish.

For me, I =
don't care which it is, I think it's valid either way. If it is
only the mi=
nd creating the messages you hear, which I doubt because others
can hear al=
ot of this stuff, then I think it's still being used as a psychic
prop and =
the information is valid.

Then there's the probelm of expectations, if you=
 test this stuff in a lab,
I think you'll limit your results, and get whate=
ver is expected. If you'r
expecting evidence of a haunting, that's what you=
 get. I was on the Queen
mary last fall, in the pool area there is supposed=
ly a littlegirl stuck
there and you can get all the EVPs, and=C2=A0 EMF rea=
dings and interactions to
verify it, but that story (I heard) was started b=
y Disney to bring in
tourists. There were some that claimed to "corss over"=
 hundreds of souls on
the QM, so why is the QM still haunted?=C2=A0 I don't=
 go the "haunted areas" to
record.

I get voices like this, which seem to b=
e pretty much ignored if it doesn't
fit the ghost hunter expectation, but i=
t shows how broadcast fragment are
manipulated.

It's not all cut and dried=
, and can be vary complicated.

A simplified TRF box, it=

Why do you bother with this kind of stuff when you were told t=
