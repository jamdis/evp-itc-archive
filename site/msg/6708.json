Technicians i \nhave found were used to get you up and running and i only now call on \nthem if i need assistance.  I don&#39;t turn the boxes on and ask for \nthem like a crutch, i conduct my session and if i need help they will \nsupply it to me if needed.  I think the whole idea is to find out who \nwe are communicating with, maybe we will never really know for sure \nbut i still try and find out as best as i can. \n\n-Steve H.\n\n \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robin Searcy Henson&quot; \n&lt;MudPuddleFarm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Frank, \n&gt; \n&gt; When you mention being distrustful of what comes through the boxes, \nare you saying you&#39;re skeptical of the &quot;technicians&quot; being who they \nsay they are?  Not trying to open another can of worms here, just \nwanting to continue learning from your experience and research.  I \nget what you&#39;re saying about becoming obsessive with the sessions.  \nI&#39;ve probably asked you this a half dozen times over the last couple \nof years, but who or what do YOU think you&#39;re/we&#39;re  communicating \nwith?\n&gt; \n&gt; Robin\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: purplespacefriend&lt;mailto:purplealiengirl@...&gt; \n&gt;   To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, February 02, 2008 7:46 PM\n&gt;   Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: File from tonight\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Have ya tried EVPmaker? It is based on that random principle, and \n&gt;   predates the boxes.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I&#39;ve heard this stuff before, about random being the best, and I \n&gt;   have to disaggree. I also think it unwise to spend every waking \n&gt;   moment doing sessions. I think it creates that expectation, and \n&gt;   perhaps desperation to make contact, and I would tend not to \ntrust \n&gt;   what comes through. \n&gt; \n&gt;   I don&#39;t trust some of this stuff because I have yet get any \n&gt;   meaningful assistence with the boxes from the so called \ntechnicians. \n&gt;   All I ever got was a telepathic &quot;suggestion&quot; to use the echo \nboxes. \n&gt;   Everything else was a assemblage of stuff I had worked on in hte \npast \n&gt;   to solve the problem of &quot;what else could I use&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt;   I hate to see yet another go down the road of &quot;this is the \nonlyest \n&gt;   way&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt;   Frank-S\n&gt;"}
