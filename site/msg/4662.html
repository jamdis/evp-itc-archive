That stink Robin! "If" it is still under warranty, return it for a brand new one. I know a few who dropped thier phone in the toilet, sink, a puddle, ruined it completely, took it back and they replaced it with a new phone. Some were new some werent. Id take it to the local wireless phone carrier (assuming you have one)and see if they can do anything for you. That is how each of them got thiers replaced. Otherwise I would send it back to the manufacturer for replacement. Just tell them its a christmas present and its not working. Dont procrastinate =) do it soon.

          I apologize up front for this, but it occurred to me some of you 
electronics nuts might be able to give me a definitive answer about a 
bad purchase I made through Ebay a few months ago.

My kid desperately wanted this particular phone for his birthday, so 
I 
bid and "won" it. Described as brand new, box never opened, yada 
yada. It arrived in seemingly perfect condition, and it took about a 
week for us to get it through our pea brains that it wasn't holding a 
charge. There was a lot going on around the house, and probably 
another 
couple of weeks went by before I decided it just needed a new 
battery. 
So I replaced the battery and got a cute little phone case to boot. 

You might guess that the new battery didn't solve the problem. By 
this 
time I had been in contact with the seller, who seemed genuinely 
sympathetic and suggested I send it back to Cingular/ATT since it was 
still "on warranty" (yeah, right). Instead, I sent it to an online 
cellphone repair company that promised they could repair any kind of 
damage for $29.95. Two weeks later they contacted me and said they 
were very sorry but the phone had suffered irrepairable water damage, 
and they could dispose of it for me and give me a $15. credit towards 
merchandise or send it back. I had them send it back, probably just 
to 
torment myself with the reminder that altogether I wasted close to 
$350.!!! I just kept digging the hole deeper and deeper..

Oh, I did contact Ebay and PayPal, but I had waited too long to file 
a 
formal complaint with either company because I simply couldn't get it 
through my head that someone would misrepresent what they were 
selling. 

So my question is, IS IT TRUE A WATER-LOGGED CELLPHONE CAN'T BE 
FIXED??
