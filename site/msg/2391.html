<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>At the beginning of file in the first 2 seconds they say &quot;He Can 
Move the Crystal&quot;, 6 seconds in it says &quot;Don&#x27;t argue with Steve&quot;, 15 
seconds in i hear &quot;Here&quot; and at 16 seconds in they say &quot;I Love 
Purple&quot;.  19 seconds in it says &quot;Heartbeat Here---Kevin is it&quot;.  The 
rest i believe is radio.

&gt; Hi all;  Well it happened again--first #24 would not work wiht 
when we were trying to get a K2 meter response the weekend before 
last. then Monday night the same thing happened wiht someone else. I 
took the box back to the work bench, and it works fine!  Our dingbat 
daughter in-law gave us a &#x27;rescue&#x27; poodle a couple weeks ago, which 
was fine, and a cute little dog. Last ngith she fell off the bed and 
broke leg! The segment talks about that, from #24. I left it long 
cuz there&#x27;s some other voices in it, like Bob Houston, a guide I 
think as he frequently comes through. It&#x27;s interesting to doa google 
on &#x27;Bob Houston&#x27;.     Frank
