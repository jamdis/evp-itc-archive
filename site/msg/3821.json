As I said, I did hear a lot of it  \npretty clearly. It was quite intense and I listened to one file after  \nthe other, without stopping, because I was so interested. But I still  \ndidn&#39;t hear a lot of what Chris &quot;interpreted.&quot; I did, however, hear a  \nlot of things he did not comment on at all. For example, when the  \ndiscussion was centered around the woman who kept claiming that she  \nhid there and the guards brought her there, the historian from the  \nprison said that the building you were in post-dated women being  \nthere.  I clearly heard the woman loudly respond by calling the  \nhistorian &quot;bitch&quot; and &quot;c**t.&quot; I also clearly heard--and someone else  \nonsite remarked on it--a clear radio fragment ending with &quot;dot.com!&quot;  \nIt was one of the loudest things on the recordings, actually. Now,  \nthis wouldn&#39;t be a big deal, except that I got the idea that Chris&#39;s  \nbox was somehow vaccinated against this occurring. ;)\n\nBut here&#39;s my question to you: Did you see *any* of the shadows,  \napparitions, or crawling black shapes? Because what I heard was a lot  \nof Chris going, &quot;Did you see that???!!! A black shadow just went  \nright up the wall!&quot; and such, and everyone else going, &quot;Where? What?  \nHuh?&quot; So, you personally, an eye witness?\n\nAnn\n\nOn Dec 3, 2007, at 7:54 PM, Steve Hultay wrote:\n\n&gt; I actually heard most of what came out of the box that night. On\n&gt; one occasion one of the boards that had a Bio on it of the history\n&gt; of that cell block actually jumped out and Chris and I and that&#39;s\n&gt; where the shadow went up the wall. I didn&#39;t see it, but i was\n&gt; working a lot of equipment that night. They were pissed at that\n&gt; time and we heard them talking at the end of the hall and not from\n&gt; the box, so they were really there.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here is the link to it, Frank. Give a listen when you have a\n&gt; couple\n&gt; &gt; hours.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I also listened to Steve H.&#39;s 2 hour recording from Eastern State\n&gt; &gt; Penn last night. I found some of it amazing and some of it wildly\n&gt; &gt; annoying, especially the researcher close by the microphone who\n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; chewing gum. That aside, there was more very odd and wonderful\n&gt; &gt; communication, and also a lot of Chris seeing shadows,\n&gt; apparitions,\n&gt; &gt; black masses crawling down hallways, and other things that no one\n&gt; &gt; else seemed to see. I wanted to ask Steve H. if he had witnessed\n&gt; any\n&gt; &gt; of this, since he was with Chris the whole time. For the\n&gt; listener,\n&gt; &gt; the effect was that of a veritable mob of live humans who (the\n&gt; posse\n&gt; &gt; that night) who were kept in a constant state of anxiety. They\n&gt; didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; need the extra hype, HMO, &#39;cause the pissed off dead inmates were\n&gt; &gt; being surly enough on their own.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d say I agreed with Chris&#39;s interpretations--and granted, I was\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; there and did have problems hearing because of gum smacking and\n&gt; other\n&gt; &gt; people rustling and talking--about 30 percent of the time. That\n&gt; said,\n&gt; &gt; I heard a lot of things loud and clear.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Dec 3, 2007, at 2:38 PM, Frank Sumption wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Interesting.

Chris&#39;s box is quite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; capable of behaving like John Edward--directly bringing relations\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through to talk to those who need to hear them. Some of the\n&gt; responses\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were astoundingly clear and loud. It certainly sounded similar\n&gt; to what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have heard of what Bruce is getting, and honestly, it is\n&gt; exactly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what I hope to get with my box when I receive it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you haven&#39;t listened to this, you really should. I think\n&gt; Chris\n&gt; &gt; &gt; made his usual statements about Edison and the 30, but aside from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that, this was a wonderful session and people were extremely\n&gt; moved.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you want, I&#39;ll find the URL.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From: Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Sent: Dec 3, 2007 12:40 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;To: Group &lt;evp-itc@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Maybe there is only one box user allowed!?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Christopher was immediately taken by what he had seen and\n&gt; heard.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He was able to &gt; make a direct connection with spirits.\n&gt; inhabitants,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; victims, participants, and &gt; witnesses...describing amazing\n&gt; events and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even some unspeakable acts that had &gt; happened within the walls\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; these notoriously haunted places. The details &gt; afforded by these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spirits gave answers to lingering questions that could not &gt;\n&gt; have come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from anyone but the parties involved. Already amazed by the &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instrument&#39;s ability to connect with these historical figures,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Christopher soon &gt; realized that other entities were trying to\n&gt; reach\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out as well. Deceased fathers, &gt; sons, mothers, daughters, and\n&gt; friends\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of session participants were sending &gt; messages through the\n&gt; device.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Talk of this spread, and last year, at the Ghost &gt; Chaser&#39;s\n&gt; Weekend\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Conference in Savannah, Georgia, Christopher was asked to do a &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; presentation about his research with the Telephone to the Dead.\n&gt; This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quickly &gt; turned into an impromtu public demonstration, with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; participants, one by one, &gt; coming forward requesting to speak\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; loved ones who had died. Surprisingly, &gt; even to Christopher,\n&gt; these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; requests were met with comforting and sometimes vital &gt;\n&gt; messages. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; presentation was recorded and broadcasted by A.P.S.R. Radio.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From a recent add for another presentation, but apparently\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rest of us get nothing like this, so it doesn&#39;t even work for us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Guess I&#39;ll just go back to killing time wth Ham radio, and quit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wasting all my time and money on useless boxes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Curious that no one else gets any &quot;real&quot; contacts--event the\n&gt; so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; called box inventor gets nothing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;__________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;You keep typing, we keep giving.
