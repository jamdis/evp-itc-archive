I think that what it tells me is  \nthat Edison [insert caveats here] is indeed interested in what you&#39;re  \nup to, while Harry remains elsewhere and isn&#39;t talking. I didn&#39;t hear  \nanything that was as startlingly clear and unlike the original voice  \nclip in this try as you got with Edison--nothing I wouldn&#39;t chalk up  \nto randomness, anyway.\n\nI do wish EVPmaker would work on Macs. I so long to try it.\n\nAgain, thanks, Misty. When you have a chance, try the Edison mix  \nagain and some of the other recordings on that site, too. Finding out  \nthat their own voices helped them come thru better for us still  \nintrigues me.\n\nAnn\n\nOn May 22, 2007, at 11:37 AM, Misty Dawn wrote:\n\n&gt; I hope you mean the recording off the rare recording site. I  \n&gt; downloaded it for you and put it thru. Lots of results some  \n&gt; relevant some not. Many female voices as well came back. I will  \n&gt; upload the results in 3 parts because theres just too many for ya  \n&gt; to post as one attachment.\n&gt;\n&gt; Misty\n&gt;\n&gt; Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; What you got is absolutely astounding. Can I ask you to do me a  \n&gt; huge favor? Would you try it with the Harry Houdini wax recording?  \n&gt; If you could, I would deeply grateful.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann\n&gt;\n&gt; On May 21, 2007, at 11:20 AM, Misty Dawn wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I used his message to the people of New Zealand.

This is amazing. What live recordings did you feed  \n&gt;&gt; into EVPMaker?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I wonder if working with their own voice in EVPmaker makes it  \n&gt;&gt; easier for them to construct an EVP? These are some of the  \n&gt;&gt; clearest EVP through EVPmaker that I have ever heard. I am really  \n&gt;&gt; astounded.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Ann\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On May 18, 2007, at 12:58 PM, Misty Dawn wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; These are from a few days ago (attached to this post for new  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; members you need to set status to &quot;individual email&quot; setting for  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; the group to get attachments). I decided since I downloaded some  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; of Edison&#39;s historical speech to compare to my evp voice that I  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; wondered what I would get if I threw one of those into evpmaker.  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I got a little more than I thought I would. It even made me have  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; to google to look up the meaning of one of the technical words LOL\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I also included the evp vs life speech side by side comparison  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; with the evp I got from ST method.
