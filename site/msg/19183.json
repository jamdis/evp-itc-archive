To me, look like long slender alien fingers that one might see in the middle of the night as a child.  It&#39;s not the spider, it&#39;s those legs.  \n\n F-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I hear US SPIDERS DO very clearly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Talking to bugs is not that weird, I am guilty of it too.  I have a dislike\n&gt; of spiders myself, they just creep me out.  Back about ten years ago I was\n&gt; living in Northern California and I moved into a house that had spiders\n&gt; everywhere!  I was practicing Wicca at the time (burn me at the stake!) so I\n&gt; had a sit down talk with them.  I told the spiders that they could have the\n&gt; kitchen, the hall and the guest bedroom and I would never bother them as\n&gt; long as they left the rest of the house alone and never bothered me when we\n&gt; shared a room.  Guess what?  The next day every spider was gone from my\n&gt; bedroom and the living room and I never had a single problem with them at\n&gt; that place.  I have a spider on my ceiling now and I talked to him at the\n&gt; beginning of summer and I told him he had to stay on that side of the room\n&gt; and he hasn&#39;t moved any closer to my side of the room.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can certainly tell the quality difference of that tuner you&#39;re using, it\n&gt; is very clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, Nov 8, 2010 at 12:55 PM, Frank Sumption\n&gt; &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  [Attachment(s) &lt;#12c2ca09b662fe87_TopText&gt; from Frank Sumption included\n&gt; &gt; below]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  My work room out in the garage, and spiders come in. I told them, yeah I\n&gt; &gt; talk to bugs--bite me and I gas everyone of ya! They stay outta sight. So\n&gt; &gt; this was recorded in the garage last night &quot;Us, (or house) Spiders Speak&quot;\n&gt; &gt; at 15 seconds. Brain is not mind, anything that lives, thinks, ghost voices\n&gt; &gt; are thoughts. If man thinks he is so advanced, how many can control eight\n&gt; &gt; legs and spin a web? How many eyes does a fly need if there is no intellect\n&gt; &gt; to process the information? Humans vastly underestimate the rest of nature.\n&gt; &gt; Human ego, unjustifiable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  These big radios make better boxes because the quality of the radio is\n&gt; &gt; better. Better front end, not so easlily overloaded by strong nearby\n&gt; &gt; signals, and better IF filter(the down conversion process), less surious\n&gt; &gt; signals, clearer sound. Larger audio amplifiers, and less distortion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  F-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
