&nbsp;No. &nbsp;I politely kept it to myself be=\r\ncause I do not like to differ with people or to deflate hot air balloons. &=\r\nnbsp;But there you have it, that is what I saw. &nbsp;And to my knowledge, =\r\nthat is the only time I have described what I have seen thus far in your im=\r\nages other than mentioning the word &quot;eyebrows.&quot; &nbsp;In the one that had m=\r\nany circles, I saw one that looked like a set of lips and a chin and the re=\r\nst I personally thought was matrixing. &nbsp;Once again, did I saw this? &n=\r\nbsp;No. &nbsp;But you asked for it so there it is.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;The whole point of my post, had you read it with a clear head. &nbsp;It =\r\nwas all about my own edification, that I, and I alone, need to keep pluggin=\r\ng in files before I, and I alone, make a judgement about MY images and whet=\r\nher they are real or not based upon the images they provide in contrast to =\r\nthe bulk of other files. &nbsp;If you simply compare your one image with th=\r\ne many circles to the youtube file, I suspect I am correct in saying that f=\r\naces occur with much more rarity than your circle file and that they can ap=\r\npear fully formed. &nbsp;Once again, I suspect, only, and I will only be ab=\r\nle to tell after time. &nbsp;Sample size is everything, and I thought I mad=\r\ne that abundantly clear. &nbsp;The post was simply about my process of lear=\r\nning rather than running out and saying look what I found when I simply don=\r\n&#39;t know what has been found yet because it is the first time I have played =\r\nwith the controls rather than seeing the end snapshots on another\n persons =\r\nwebsite. &nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Why do you always jump on the de=\r\nfensive and attack every one who does not fall in line with you?

&quot; is what I am after. &nbsp;If a positiv=\r\ne hit like this happens, then I will be jumping for joy. &nbsp;Another good=\r\n example would be a name, lets say Tom, that occurs. &nbsp;If you get a pos=\r\nitive affirmation that the name you heard is present, then you try the same=\r\n technique only you address Tom by name and get a face, that would be even =\r\nbetter.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;But, as it stands now, the faces as they=\r\n appear are random at best. &nbsp;I would be more inclined to believe that =\r\nwhen these faces do occur , they are going to occur with a lesser frequency=\r\n than multiple images in a few seconds of audio like Ursula&#39;s example. &nbs=\r\np;If this where the case, there would be dozens, and possibly hundreds, of =\r\nfaces during a ten minute session and I just don&#39;t think that is possible. =\r\n&nbsp;This is why I need to look at several samples to find out if this is =\r\nthe case or not. &nbsp;If these partialized faces occur in multiples all th=\r\ne time, I would be more apt to discount it. &nbsp;But, if they are a rarity=\r\n affixed to only a few clips out of dozens, I would be more inclined to bel=\r\nieve in them. &nbsp;Sample size is everything. &nbsp;It is like listening t=\r\no GBC. &nbsp;If you have never done a session before, you would be inclined=\r\n to believe every stray radio signal is a communication. &nbsp;Only by cont=\r\ninued practice\n (expanding your sample size) can you start to rule out stra=\r\ny radio with any degree of accuracy. &nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;On t=\r\nhe other hand, I am very new to this and I could certainly be wrong. &nbsp;=\r\nI will continue to plug sound into the programs and hope for the best. &nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I really want this to work. &nbsp;As you have=\r\n probably experienced, when they want you to hear something or know somethi=\r\nng, they make it very obvious while communicating. &nbsp;I am hoping they a=\r\npply this same rigor to this new format to show us that they are there. &nb=\r\nsp;If they can, then the world of video and audio ITC will merge in one sou=\r\nrce and then the skeptics be damned!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Tim&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;On Sat, Dec 18, 2010 at 2:24 PM, Frank Sumption &lt;SPAN dir=3Dltr&gt;&lt;&lt;=\r\nA href=3D&quot;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dpurplealiengirl@g=\r\nmail.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;purplealiengirl@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;=\r\n/SPAN&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;I think it&#39;s unrealistic to expect every file to have fa=\r\nces and images.
