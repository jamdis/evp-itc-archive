Babs to answer you question, I believe that they can see us as well as hear us.  I have attached a file where they repeatedly ask for me by name (which could not be the radio, given the odds the radio would not be saying my name over and over quickly).  The final message was conference call at the end of the clip.  At that time, I was actually getting a conference call from Bruce and Steve via Skype and I had no way of knowing since the conference call came through on my other laptop in my office.
   
  On another session, one of my Daughter's walked into my office and upon entry (never speaking a word) they said "Hello Alexxis".  This actually freaked her out.  She never said anything but yet they acknowledged her presences as she walked in the room.  Once again what are the odds that you would get all of my members of my families names correct that happen to be in the room during a session?

          Hi LC. Yes, I am Babs from Atlanta and co-founder of The Psi Network.
Jim had mentioned you a while back so when you signed up here I know
who you were. I have listened to your files, the "Gino" one was
interesting. 

Jim brought the 469 to a holiday party here at my house a few weeks
ago. It did seem as if we were getting answers that I found incredibly
easy to understand. Unfortunately we had all had cocktails so I knew
it was no where near objective. Two days later I made the purchase and
completed the hack. 

I have had several unsuccessful sessions which frankly (pardon the
pun) is what I expected. My goal is to make a determination based on
my trials. After the initial party session, subsequent sessions have
been done by me alone. The next step for me will be to bring in a
group of people who will make notations (non-verbal) as to what they
think they hear. I'm doing this because I believe strongly in the
effects of energy and people on these devices. The non-verbal
notations need no further explanations. I will also place people where
they can't see if someone is writing something. 

On a recent post of Juli's (I believe) she mentions hearing Bruce and
Steve's voices coming through her device. If that's the case then I
think a lot more objective study is needed, in particular with the RS
versions and the mini-box (those using linear sweep methods). Now
don't get me wrong here... I have heard compelling files from these LS
models. However, we all know the inherent problems with naming files
what we think we hear. The listener than expects to hear the same
thing and typically does. Also, I have heard files that seem to be a
direct, intelligent response to the question asked but what I would
like to see is the question asker request a certain word to be spoken
and have that happen within a certain time frame. We should be able to
say "Say Bruce or Babs or Steve...." and have that happen rather
quickly. A list of control questions could easily be developed that
would add to the credibility of these devices and could only help
research move forward. Has anyone asked whether or not the spirits
could see us as well as hear us? If the answer is yes than that leads
to a whole other set of questions whose answers could easily be verified. 

I realize that the majority here are not interested in the idea of
disproving but I think it needs to be done. Controlled study is a
necessity.
