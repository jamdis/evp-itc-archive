<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Babs,

Are you out of the Atlanta area?  If so are you from PSI?  My cousin 
Jim is in PSI, and purchased a 469 for the group.  He had heard some 
of my initial recordings of experiments I ran for audio set-up.  They 
were recorded with the 469, and did not come through until the 5th 
test for me.  It was as if the mish mash began being manipulated and 
I could then hear responses.  The recordings are under LC&#x27;s... in the 
file section.  I currently have two 470&#x27;s which will be experimented 
with after the holidays...

The more you work with the box, the more those on the other side 
become aware of one&#x27;s attempts at making contact, IMHO.  For me, I 
can feel a spiritual presence when the audio bits/white noise begin 
being manipulated.  When in doubt, just keep making 
recordings...sooner or later you will begin hearing words, responses, 
sentences.  Some of what I heard has been quite crafty, such as 
giving me my wife&#x27;s name clearly, right before she phoned me, etc.

&gt; Thanks Juli, it&#x27;s nice to be back. Holiday times always get so 
hectic.
&gt; 
&gt; On a side note here- I&#x27;ve been working with a 469 shack hack and 
have
&gt; yet to get anything I can consider a direct response or intelligible
&gt; communication. IMO, thus far, I hear nothing besides radio 
fragments.
&gt; Going on the theory that this device enables the same real time 2-
way
&gt; communication as Frank&#x27;s Box or it&#x27;s &quot;children&quot;, requesting that my
&gt; own name be said doesn&#x27;t seem like it should be a difficult task. I
&gt; have even told them my name, as a just-in-case measure. Nothing even
&gt; resembling my name, or in name for that matter. When asked what 
their
&gt; name is, also nothing but radio fragment. Sessions with EVPmaker 
have
&gt; always provided intelligent responses and results.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Robin-- I have watched this clip and it is the least convincing 
of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; all the ones I have seen of him with the box. I have heard 
several 
&gt; &gt; &gt; where some of the audio is clear enough to stand on its own 
without 
&gt; &gt; &gt; his interpretation, and where his interpretation generally 
agrees. I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; have also heard some where the audio I hear disagrees with his 
&gt; &gt; &gt; interpretation, but not to such a high degree that I was 
overtly 
&gt; &gt; &gt; troubled by it--it was in what I would call the high-end of my 
&gt; &gt; &gt; tolerance range for subjectivity. I have heard audio where the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; person asking questions of the box clearly heard answered that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; appeared to move them greatly without dependance on Chris&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; &gt; interpretation.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, to try to sum up for you, my personal investigation led me 
to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe that something was happening with the box. I did not 
always 
&gt; &gt; &gt; agree with Chris&#x27;s interpretation, but it appeared the same or 
close 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to what I heard a high enough percentage of the time that I was 
&gt; &gt; &gt; willing to accept he was not faking it, but giving it an honest 
&gt; &gt; &gt; enough go. It led me to start hounding Frank for a box of my 
own, and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; later to buy a minibox from Rick, since poor Frank was beset on 
all 
&gt; &gt; &gt; sides. ;)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; We&#x27;ve already had some spectacularly burning arguments about 
what 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Chris claims his guides or technicians tell him behind closed 
doors. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, no audio of this is public, so his claims 
can&#x27;t be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; evaluated. I think the proliferation of people getting results 
with 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the boxes belies his assertion that only 30 are chosen.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think some of you were discussing this recently, but I&#x27;m 
wondering
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what you all think. I&#x27;ve watched/listened to this video a 
number of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times and can&#x27;t figure out if the participants are actually 
hearing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; responses on their own or are totally relying on Chris to 
interpret 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them what is being said. I&#x27;m disappointed because I honestly 
can&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hear the words he&#x27;s repeating as being from spirit.
