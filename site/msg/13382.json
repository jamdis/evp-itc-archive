I apologize, but I have long since lost the original citation, so I can&#39;t offer it to you.\n\nWhat I remember from my research at the time was that Edison did indeed believe that the voices of spirits could be recorded, and in fact his work on what turned out to be the phonograph (capturing voices on wax cylinders, later on flat platters, later on what we call records) was intended to eventually lead to being able to record spirit voices. Apparently he got as far as figuring out how to record incarnate human voices &lt;g&gt;, but stopped before he got any spirit voices. I seem to dimly remember some comment that he thought his technology needed to be further developed, but he didn&#39;t pursue it, at least not in any way that has ever been publicly disclosed.\n\nHope this helps, though the citation is lacking!\n\nBest,\n\nLeslie\n\n&gt;From: Rick &lt;rasterer@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: TruTV with the Box\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt;Date: Friday, February 6, 2009, 9:24 AM&gt;\n&gt;    \n&gt; I suppose ultimately, it doesn&#39;t really matter if Edison made a telephone to the dead or not.  &gt;Modern researchers in this field will have to stand on their own results anyway, and if they&#39;ve &gt;managed to discover something that Edison never achieved, good for them!\n&gt;\n&gt;I have also heard varied claims: that Edison did make this box; that Edison was working on it but &gt;never finished it; that Edison was joking when he mentioned working on it.  So for my own sake, I&#39;d &gt;like to know the real story."}
