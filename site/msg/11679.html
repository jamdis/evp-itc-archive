<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>On just a basic investigation with only a couple of people, we
normally use:
Digital cameras
Video Cameras: Sony DCR-HC52 with Sony Infrared Extender HVL-IRM
Digital Voice Recorders: My favorite is the Olympus WS-300M
EMF Meters; one with a digital display, the other with a multicolor
LED readout
Hacked 12-469
And Wavepad and Audacity for editing the audio (Mainly audacity)

cameras from time to time)
&gt; Motion detectors

&gt; Laser trap (a home made laser grid that has motion detectors on it..
we keep a video camera on it and if the grid gets broken.. well.. then
we might have caught something)

&gt; UV flashlights
&gt; Oh.. of course pen &amp; paper..
