<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>So I finally got some motivation and figured out how to get a file from my cassette tape to the computer.  It&#x27;s in the &quot;Files&quot; area here (hopefully I did everything correctly and according to protocol):

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Jill%27s%20Ghost%20Box%20Files/

I cleaned it up somewhat in Audacity, taking out all the extra radio snippets, so what&#x27;s left is me asking for someone to say my niece&#x27;s name, and then the four &quot;Katies&quot; that came after that.  There&#x27;s even, I think, a fifth Katie tucked in there while I&#x27;m asking, as well as the obligatory &quot;I love you&quot; first thing after I&#x27;ve finished asking.  

Some background:  Got my niece and cousin to do a session with me today.  Cousin has been dragging her feet, is skeptical, and the niece just arrived from out of town, is more openminded.  I&#x27;m pleased we got someone to say her name four times in a row, and I&#x27;m uploading it here so she can hear it back home.  So this isn&#x27;t the best file I have.  Maybe now that I know how to upload (if it worked), I can upload some of my better session happenings!</pre>
