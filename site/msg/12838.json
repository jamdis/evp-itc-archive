I&#39;ve already mentioned \nthat I&#39;m reading the book, &#39;Voice Transmissions With The Deceased&#39;, \nby Friedrich Jrgenson. He discovered he could receive EVPs in the \nlate 1950s during a recording session where he was capturing bird \ncalls. \n\nIn the spring of 1960 one of the voices he captured on tape told \nJurgenson to &quot;use the radio&quot; as a medium. After that, he used this \nradio technique until his death. He connected a microphone and a \nradio receiver to the tape recorder and in this way he could have a \nreal-time conversation with his &quot;friends&quot;, as he called them. \n\nUsually he would set the radio for reception at frequencies where \nthere is generally a variation of noises coming through. Later, he \nmaintained the receiving frequencies to around 1445-1500 kHz. 1485.0 \nkHz has been labelled the Jrgenson Frequency. \n\nAnother very interesting tidbit is; In 1978 Jurgenson held a press \nconference and a number of lectures for groups. It was then that he \npredicted that we would soon be able to receive messages through \ntelevision as well. He labeled the work &quot;Audioscopic Research.&quot; \n\nAs you can see today, many use this form of ITC in an attempt to \nreceive images of entities or spirits on a monitor or television set. \nThere have even been a number of movies about this form of spirit \ncommunication.\n\n- Mike (UFO Geek)\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com"}
