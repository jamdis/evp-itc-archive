OK thanks for the info

therefore, business will continue as usual until:

1 - Negative feedback is left 
(which isn't likely, because the units do work, and people are apparently unaware they've 
overpaid - grossly, in some cases - at the time of leaving feedback)

2 - People learn they can do it themselves and/or that they are overpaying for a common 
item easily available via Radio Shack directly (BEFORE they buy on eBay - hindsight is 
20/20, but doesn't effect product demand so much unless the knowledge comes prior to 
purchase)

3 - Supply exceeds demand (which could be a lot quicker if people were educated)

If he's a smart seller, he does not stock pile, but fills orders on demand. And, if he were to 
be left with any non-selling units, I'm guessing he'd do as others have, and simply return 
them to Radio Shack... hacked or not. So, no loss in his part there.

You may have been the first to bring it up on the boards recently, but I (along with others, 
I'm sure) have been watching what's been going on, on eBay, before it being brought up 
here. I think I first took note, probably in Nov or Dec of last year, shortly after the hack 
instructions first went mainstream. Some sellers, not all, made a killing on the old 
versions of the 12-470's and 12-469's, not even pre-hacked.

I've never had strong feelings about it all one way or another, but have certainly found it to 
be extremely fascinating as an observer, watching the market. Same with the Panasonic 
DR60's, which I've been monitoring for a couple years now. At the height of the frenzy, 
people were willing to pay up to a $1,000! These days, a seller is lucky to get $500. And 
I've seen many selling in the $200-$300 range.
