Perhaps it&#39;s so some sort of lock-on \nwith those on the otherside can be established. From my ITC reading, \nthere is something of a challange to ITC due to unsynchronized \ndifference of time and space between hither and yon. \n\nPerhaps leaving a Box on and running in one location improves the \nchances by allow those using their tech on the otherside to establish \na better connection.\n\nFor some silly reason I was just reminded of a scene from an old \nclassic, The Time Tunnel. I visualized again those white coated \nscientists in the control room, using the big machine to scan across \nthe vastness, trying to get a stable lock on Doug and Tony... lost in \ntime!\n\nLance\n \n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  My only advice, use it from the same location, at least for a \ncouple days. There seesm to be something they cannect to it. My \nversion of the nMini box wasn&#39;t working well froa a couple days, then \nal the suddenn started working. the radio was scanning, and the \nelectronics was working, just the &quot;voices&quot; were weak. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  but...what do I know?\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: orbhunterx@...: Mon, 3 Dec 2007 05:19:20 \n+0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Idle threats from a coward\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I&#39;ve gone ahead and done it...I purchased one of Ron&#39;s \nMiniBox&#39;s!!No snowball will be safe in hell now!Tell you what, \ninstead of asking Chris about life and death or heaven and hell, I \nplan to:1)Take a training class provided freely by ASUP.2)Engage in a \nlittle direct inquiry and testing of spirits.3)Strongly encourage \nfearless people to find their own answers, by doing something \nlikewise. Thanks,Lance--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;babiarz3&quot; \n&lt;babiarz3@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Lance, &gt; I think you make my point very well. \nYou say you don&#39;t know Chris&gt; personally but that it seems I am the \none wearing rose colored&gt; glasses. I do know Chris. Even when Frank \nis upset he says &quot;Chris is a&gt; nice guy&quot;. Chris&#39; statements and \nbeliefs have never changed while&gt; others can be wishy washy depending \non the day. The view that Chris&gt; does not want any one to research \nthe box besides him is BS. The fact&gt; is that prior to Franks original \nyahoo group disappearing, Chris&gt; provided a link directly to the \nschematics. In his presentations he&gt; would tell people that the \nschematics were available online. Yet,&gt; because he is against mass \nproduction, it MUST be because he wants the&gt; research all to himself. \nRose colored glasses or a case of only seeing&gt; what is wanted? This \nis a fact compared to perceptions and opinions. &gt; &gt; Fact: Almost each \nand every user of a box or it&#39;s facsimile have&gt; stated that lower \nenergy/evil/dark... entities have spoken via the&gt; device. &gt; &gt; Fact: \nRick Moran states that the groups for testing will include&gt; \nbelievers, skeptics, senior citizens, (now here&#39;s where it gets scary)\n&gt; CHILDREN and HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS!&gt; &gt; - Couple the last two facts \ntogether and do the math. One mentally&gt; unstable child or youth hears \nthe box tell him it is right to kill or&gt; rape or .....&gt; &gt; Fact: Rick \nMoran in his article about Tools being only as good as the&gt; users \nstates, &quot;...know how they work before you go into the field.&quot; &gt; So, \nin one place we are still testing, in another we are sending them&gt; \nout in the field to be tested by groups that include children and \nhigh&gt; school students. The good thing is that a nice little online \ntutorial&gt; is available with some warnings. Phew! As long as this \ncan&#39;t come back&gt; on anyone I guess all the bases are covered (tongue \nin cheek). &gt; &gt; Fact: Chris has been the primary tester of the device \nin the field.&gt; That fact deserves consideration, at the very least. &gt; \n&gt; Fact: Last night, a radio personality on Spooky South Coast \nclaimed&gt; that after he engaged the dark voices coming through the \nbox, he was&gt; physically attacked.&gt; &gt; Fact: Frank has stated that in \nthe beginning Chris was the only one&gt; who understood how the box \nshould be used.&gt; &gt; Fact: Some people who have received boxes from \nFrank discovered they&gt; were not able to use them although they worked \nfine for Frank. These&gt; same people would not return the boxes to be \nlooked at.&gt; &gt; Fact: After death communications have been received via \nboth computers&gt; and phones. If it were simply the devices and not the \nusers would we&gt; not have millions of these communications?&gt; &gt; Fact: \nMark Macy states that in an after death communication&gt; communication \nwith Konstanin Raudive in which Mark asks &quot; Can you tell&gt; me about \nthe equipment you use to produce a perfect, almost perfect&gt; voice on \nearth?&quot; Konstanin replies &quot;Well it depends on your reception-&gt; or \nmainly your psychic reception.&quot; This fact backs up the theory that&gt; \neffective users are limited.&gt; &gt; Fact: In another after death \ncommunication Konstanin addresses contact&gt; fields saying &quot;...but if \nthere is dissonance in the form of fears,&gt; doubts, and animosities \nthe contact field becomes cloudy...that&#39;s when&gt; negative spirit \ngroups close to earth in vibration can break into&gt; existing bridges \nwith troubling results.&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; And so yes, maybe I wear rose colored \nglasses. However, I am inclined&gt; to believe that I have done my \nresearch and have availed myself of&gt; quite a bit of information \nregarding this topic. &gt; &gt; With that said, I am holding an online \nevent where people can ask&gt; Chris the questions they want as long as \nthey are formed in an&gt; intelligent manner. If you are interested in \nattending the event you&gt; can find the information on the front page \nof my site at&gt; www.thepsinetwork.com I felt it unnecessary to attempt \nto &quot;bridge the&gt; gap&quot; as well between speculation, insinuation and \nfact. &gt; &gt; Sincerely,&gt; Babs&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-\nITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Lance Oliver&quot; &lt;orbhunterx@&gt; wrote:&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hey \nBab,&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even though I&#39;ve newly begun to chime in here, it seems \nto me that &gt; &gt; some people are guilty of wearing rose colored \nglasses, as far as &gt; &gt; Chris is concerned. LOL! I don&#39;t know him \npersonally, so I really &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know what really motivates him. \nRight or wrong, by conducting &gt; &gt; himself in the manner he has, it&#39;s \nunderstandable why his approach &gt; &gt; has drawn the scrutiny from his \npeers. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frankly, this entire effort is a great learning \nexperience and &gt; &gt; potential healing for mankind! I encourage all of \nus researcher types &gt; &gt; to simply sit back, and take a deep breath or \nthree. Consider &gt; &gt; together why we&#39;re doing this.
