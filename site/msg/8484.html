  If you like the 469 you will really like the 12-820.  Its a joggers radio and it is smaller.  It has NO CLICKING on the am band and has a nicer sweep on the fm  than the older 12-470's.  AGain it  works the same as the 12-469 and you will need an external speaker as the antenna.

  The 12-469 doesn't have a antenna on the outside, and what you do is hold it in your hand.  Your body acts as the antenna, and that's how I got my best reception.  But this is my opinion, go with your gut feeling, if you get a radio you don't like just take it back to the shack.  Act like nothing is wrong with it, and try the other one.
