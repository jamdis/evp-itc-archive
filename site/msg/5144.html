Ron,
 
First thank you for your kind comments but the only difference betw=
een you and I is the time I have been researching.
You will surely get ther=
e especially with the effort you are making in a tough situation, most woul=
d have just given up.
You can believe that our friends on the other side ap=
preciate that kind of dedication.
 
That being said, when you do a session =
with the box the communication is mainly formulated by our friends using th=
e fragments of sound coming from the radio signal you recieve.
Is it possib=
le to get communication with this little number of available stations ? Yes=
 but it will be limited in the fact that the communicating spirit will need=
 to wait that much longer 
to try and catch coinciding fragment to form an =
individual word or phrase. The theory is, the more signal you have, the mor=
e fragments of words you have , the easier for our friends to utilize them =
to form mor and cuncurrent words phrases and even whole sentences.
 
I am s=
ure they are aware of your particular curcumstances and are putting in the =
extra effort to try and solve the problem and at least get whatever communi=
cation they can across.
But you also have to do your level best to facilita=
te a good signal and reception, working together in harmony with your spiri=
t communicators and fellow researchers will aid in the strenthening of all =
our communication. So don't give up and don't get to frustrated approach th=
e sessions with a positive outlook and that energy alone will help boost co=
mmunication. And I'm sure we here will do all we can to help.
 
As for the =
spanish language signals, It does not matter what language the transmition =
of the signal is in because they do not utilise full radio words or sentenc=
es to communicate, they put the words together using bits and pieces of the=
 radio signal so even if you where doing research in china or germany and r=
ecieved only signals in that native language your spirit friends, knowing y=
ou personaly would use the fragments of sound to form their communication i=
n your own language. they become your personal friends and protectors and w=
ill do everything in their power to communicate with you. All you need is a=
n open mind and heart, they will take care of the rest.
 
Juli valazqueaz w=
ill be posting a session data sheet, I suggest you use one for every sessio=
n to determine if there are certain times and conditions in your location t=
hat are better than others for doing a session.
 
any other questions you h=
ave no matter how dumb you think they are please feel free to contact me on=
 the the board or by e-mail  paranormalinvestigating@...

Thanks for the encouragement Bruce.  You are correc=
t I have a rs 12-469 and I cut the pin so it scans continually when needed.=
   I at times used audacity on my computer to record, thinking that speed c=
ontrol would be useful to interpret messages...nice thought.   I like the s=
implicity of your suggestion to just plug the radio directly into the digit=
al recorder.  Not knowing exactly how all this goes down, I thought the rad=
io scan sounds need to mix in the room so that the techs on the other side =
can respond.  Whatever works.  
 
The other main question I have is regardi=
ng the radio stations I can pick up here in my part of Mexico, on the Yucat=
an.  I only get several stations during a complete scan of all a.m. or f.m.=
 channels...don't know if that is enough.  It has been suggested that I som=
ehow can add an antenna to search for more channels, which I would attempt =
if it is really necessary.  I get mostly Spanish language stations and an o=
ccasional station from Texas that skips across the Gulf of Mexico.  Not muc=
h to scan.  Any thoughts on this?
 
By the way, I think the work you are do=
ing is, well, extraordinary.    Like pros from any other field of endeavor,=
 you make this stuff look easy to do...not so.  Thanks again.   Ron L

Hey Ron L., In m=

there would be no need for EVP maker or a microphone to be used during a se=

Bruce, I now have done a few days =
testing with my rs 690, evp maker, audacity, a mic, and my handheld digital=
 recorder.  Nada, nothing, zilch.  Maybe because I only get to scan past 5 =

 help.  Ron Lbruce halliday <paranormalinvestigating@...> wrote:
