development.  I rarely get mean spirits around me.When I do I stand up and =
they don't come back.  You are always in control!! :)

      well if yall are very expie=

      I know t=

me i did an evp i got nothing till the 3rd time. Then its seems that it ope=
ned a door for them, they are conversing amongst themselves saying hello to=
 each other, that they can see, they can see the computer, one of them said=
 he was beseiged. I didnt record again till yesterday, and i kinda wonder i=
f they are mad? i kept getting vibes to record but have been to tired with =
moving. Can they get mad with you? i assume they can. When i recorded, i ha=

alking too, if they can see the computer <so they said> why not?! I also us=
ed this thing from EVP maker that shows pictures and makes clicks and tones=
. The only thing they had to say was "watch" watch", wether they ment to no=
t say anything and just watch m e or refering to some of the questions i ha=
d, i dont know, cant assume anything lol. What can i do to get them to talk=
 to me more? Answer questions? like no one has indentified themselves and i=
 would really like to know who they are. I have a few people i would like t=

      I would like to have =
