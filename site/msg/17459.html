Thanks. I thought that was the way it worked, but wanted to clarify.

&gt; Hi Draiga,
&gt; 
&gt; You&#x27;re not butting in at all!  
&gt; 
&gt; You&#x27;re also correct:  Unless we have a satellite way out there that sees things sooner, all of our data is based on what we perceive, and how long that information/image takes to get to a point where we (or our devices) can perceive it.
&gt; 
&gt; So, when we talk about something happening two weeks ago -- but we&#x27;re talking about something, say, 100 light years away -- we&#x27;re usually talking about us _seeing it happen_ two weeks ago.
&gt; 
&gt; In actual fact, it happened about a hundred years ago.  We&#x27;re only now seeing it.
&gt; 
&gt; Wormholes may provide us with exceptions.  Black holes may be deterrents in how quickly (if ever) we perceive things here.
&gt; 
&gt; It&#x27;s wild stuff, isn&#x27;t it!  I often call this &quot;pretzel logic&quot; because I so often have to wrap my brain into (illogical?) twists so this makes sense to me.
&gt; 
&gt; Most of the time, I have to pause and think it through, or sketch it on paper so I have a visual understanding of the concepts.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheerfully,
&gt; Fiona

&gt; &gt; Fiona,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sorry to butt in, but I&#x27;m curious. If this is happening 500 Light Years away from us, doesn&#x27;t that mean it will be visible to us in 500 years? I know that there is a delay with sound such as thunder, then the delay before an individual hears it depending on how far they are from where the sound originated. Wouldn&#x27;t it be the same with light?
