It took me forever to figure out how to do everything to create my YouTube video, \nbut I finally got it all together and posted.  I&#39;ve never done anything of this nature before.  \nLOL - sometimes I can be a wee bit on the technologically challenged side!  ;-)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmlox_8H5lo\n\nHope you enjoy it if you decide to watch.  I figured another video promoting the POSITIVE \nside to spirit communication would help counterbalance some of the garbage out there.  \n\nMargaret"}
