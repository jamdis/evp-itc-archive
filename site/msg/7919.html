Hi stefan   I checked out the evpuk site but can't get the download.  Not sure of the unzip process but I think I should be able to handle the download at my end.  Any other options.  I am in Mexico and can't seem to get reliable radio signals with my RS hacks.  Maype a computer based program like evpuk might be my best option.  Ron l

http://www.evpuk.com/evp_assistant_information.html and it's a noise
generator which can play up to 5 prerecorded sounds simultaneously. The
spiricom noise sounds a bit different than the one I had created by
simply mixing the 13 frequencies (131, 141, 151, 241, 272, 282, 292,
302, 415, 443, 515, 653, 701 Hz); obviously not all of the tones have
the same level, and some vary constandly. I have a copy of the original
Spiricom tape on which the sound of the voices can be heard. It's a
robotic like sound and it reminds me of Vocoder voices, or voices made
with these speech aid devices for people with larynx cancer (dunno the
technical term for these devices).
