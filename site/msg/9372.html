<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Jeremy.  My babies are doing just fine.  All three napping around me at the moment.  
Ahhhh.... very quiet.  LOL.

I&#x27;ll be darned if I can find that video.  I&#x27;m still combing through YouTube.  I wonder if I saw 
it somewhere else and am misremembering where.  

That&#x27;s weird about the Luminator and the wall.  eeek!  Fun stuff!!

OK, gonna look a little more.

&gt; Hey Margaret,
&gt; 
&gt; How are you today? :) And how are your babies. :)
&gt; 
&gt; No, I haven&#x27;t seen that video, although I would LOVE to see it.
&gt; 
&gt; Mark Macy was near NYC last summer in CONN. with his Luminator at a
&gt; Spiritualist Church. I so wanted to go see him, but we had a family
&gt; emergency and I wasn&#x27;t able to attend.
&gt; 
&gt; I read that the man that invented the Luminator had a couple going in
&gt; a room. He sat down to meditate and when he put his head against the
&gt; wall, his head went through the wall like it wasn&#x27;t there. The
&gt; Luminator must change the energy big time. I would be very interested
&gt; in EVP capture when in the presence of a Luminator. Talk about Class A
&gt;  EVP&#x27;s. LOL.
&gt; 
&gt; Hugs to your pups.
&gt; 
&gt; Blessings All,

&gt; &gt; Hi Jeremy.  Did you ever see the video on YouTube?  I&#x27;m not finding
&gt; it at the moment, but 
&gt; &gt; they video&#x27;d one of the sessions.  It was quite interesting, but I
&gt; don&#x27;t remember which 
&gt; &gt; researcher (it was a man) that was conducting the session.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The communication was done not via radio, but telephone directly to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the researchers homes. There were numerous telephone calls made to
&gt; &gt; &gt; Maggy Harsch-Fishbach, Mark Macy and even to Sarah Estep. These phone
&gt; &gt; &gt; calls were made by members of the group on the Other Side working with
&gt; &gt; &gt; ITC researchers during the 1990&#x27;s. The group working with the ITC
&gt; &gt; &gt; researchers were guided by seven Ethereal beings on the Other Side
&gt; &gt; &gt; called The Seven. Contact was not only made via telephone, but also
&gt; &gt; &gt; fax and files placed in Maggy Fishbach&#x27;s computer. :)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I highly recommend Mr. Macy&#x27;s book, Miracles In The Storm. He has much
&gt; &gt; &gt; of this information on his website. http://worlditc.org
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Many Blessings All,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And were using Hacked Radios to talk to the dead! I am not sure I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe that one.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is the phone call made to Mark Macy by Konstantin

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Macy talked about this phone call in his excellent book
