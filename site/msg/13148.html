He has quite alot of them up now (more than last time I went, good job Mike). He has always posted them freely and shares his research with others. He also posts alot on his websites.

&gt; Hi Mike, Is this going to be something you sell or something
&gt; that can
&gt; be seen on youtube or some other place?
&gt; 
&gt; What Youtube videos of yours can i see now? 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Richard

&gt; &gt; Richard, Misty, and all other fellow researchers,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is a fasinating topic, one that I am currently
&gt; most interested 
&gt; &gt; with as my latest experiment/research project is all
&gt; about.
&gt; &gt; The crash debris that was sent to 8 researchers, I
&gt; believe, does hold 
&gt; &gt; imprints from a violent past.
&gt; &gt; As does the area where the original crash happened,
&gt; since there are 
&gt; &gt; still amounts of debris scattered around the immediate
&gt; area, as well 
&gt; &gt; as beneath the surface where now stands a memorial. 
&gt; Not to mention 
&gt; &gt; it is the last place where living humans were quickly
&gt; lost.  Just 
&gt; &gt; imagine the amount of energy that must be imprinted on
&gt; that exact 
&gt; &gt; spot.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That is where I hoped to gain a better understanding
&gt; of that energy 
&gt; &gt; which is imprinted... and I must say, I think I have
&gt; done just that.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Today I processed a number of the files I captured
&gt; from the impact 
&gt; &gt; point using numerous devices of the non-microphone
&gt; type.  After I put 
&gt; &gt; each of these files through a four step process (which
&gt; I&#x27;ll explain 
&gt; &gt; in great detail in my video), I was able to listen to
&gt; some amazing, 
&gt; &gt; and very relivent sounds.
&gt; &gt; My wife was so upset after I told her what I had
&gt; heard, she refused 
&gt; &gt; to listen to the audio.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Let me just say... the combination I used was able to
&gt; capture a very 
&gt; &gt; chilling scene.  One I just have to believe were the
&gt; last moments of 
&gt; &gt; those who perished.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Once I publish the final results, I hope others will
&gt; be able to 
&gt; &gt; verify what I am hearing...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m figuring to put a multi-part video on my
&gt; Youtube page.  One part 
&gt; &gt; explaining what will be seen an heard, as well as
&gt; describing the 
&gt; &gt; events of that day.  Another part with my sessions at
&gt; the various 
&gt; &gt; locations, using various methods.  And a final part
&gt; with the audio of 
&gt; &gt; the researchers who assisted with this experiment
&gt; using the debris I 
&gt; &gt; sent each of them.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Bottom line... I really do believe that energy is
&gt; imprinted in 
&gt; &gt; objects, and at locations where energy was strong at a
&gt; time of 
&gt; &gt; imprint.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Happy Holidays to all.... have a safe and fun Holiday
&gt; Season!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Richard,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thats a great example and a good way to look at
&gt; things. the old 
&gt; &gt; idea 
&gt; &gt; &gt; that energy doesnt die its just transformed holds
&gt; true with that 
&gt; &gt; too. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen the same thing done with missing
&gt; appendages, tho a 
&gt; &gt; finger 
&gt; &gt; &gt; may have been removed it still registers under
&gt; kirlian photography 
&gt; &gt; as 
&gt; &gt; &gt; its energy being present.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just because we dont see something or hear a
&gt; thing doesnt mean it 
&gt; &gt; is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; nonexistant =) Perhaps it just means we are deaf
&gt; and blind to its 
&gt; &gt; &gt; existence.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for replying to my message.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Years ago I watched a slide show featuring
&gt; several photo&#x27;s taken 
&gt; &gt; via
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kirlian photography. It seems kirlian
&gt; photography captures certain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; types of energy on film. In the
&gt; demonstration a picture of a 
&gt; &gt; house 
&gt; &gt; &gt; was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shown. Later that same house had a fire and
&gt; part of the house had 
&gt; &gt; &gt; been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; burned to the ground but the photo taken
&gt; with kirlian photography
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later showed that part of the house still
&gt; there.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m no expert but maybe energy we
&gt; can&#x27;t see leaves an imprint in 
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; non physical universe and can be viewed or
&gt; demonstrated using the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right instruments and technique. Of course I
&gt; really have no clue 
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; am fascinated by the evp and itc phenomena.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Enjoyed visiting your site, thanks for the
&gt; link.
