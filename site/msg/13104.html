Just an engineering point.=A0 Radio radiates out kind of like a donut turn=
ed on it's side.=A0 So directly under, up to a dozen or so feet from a towe=
r has zero transmission.

It kind of looks like this:

=A0 |
=A0(|)
------
=

Where the parenthesis are the radio waves.=A0 Except they do not really ge=
t that close to the tower base.

The point of the strongest signal is a lit=
tle past the height of the tower.=A0 So if the tower is 100' then if you mo=
ve away from the tower to about 110' or so that is the most powerful signal=
.

.  I also tried the local police and some microwave towers, 

righ=
t under the towers, and heard nothing from those sources. But they 

are on=
 much higher frequencies than AM or FM radio and are not known to 

get int=
o any electronics around here.
