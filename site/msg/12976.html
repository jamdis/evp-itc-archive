<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>All the EVP I&#x27;ve gotten seem to be from spirits who were human at one 
time. What Frank and others have been getting on Frank&#x27;s boxes or the RS 
hacks could be anybody&#x27;s guess, but they appear to be communicating ideas 
we can understand.

The most threatening thing I&#x27;ve ever heard was in a site where there were 
possibly many ghosts.  Many people had died there.  One voice simply said 
&quot;Leave this building!&quot; in a stern voice.

Yet, at the same location, someone asked if they wanted us to leave and a 
different voice said &quot;You just got here.&quot;

Go figure.

&gt; Ditto to all you said Margaret, and I&#x27;ll further add that many times people
&gt; record all sorts of voices that we would consider &quot;non-human&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure 
&gt; why people
&gt; insist on stereotyping voices. Probably the ridiculous shows on the Travel &amp; 
&gt; Sci Fi Channels and superstitious religious
&gt; dogma.
&gt;
&gt; There are many dimensions and Multiverses around us. No one can judge a voice 
&gt; based on it&#x27;s sound,
&gt; tone, or anything else. It&#x27;s too bad the media can&#x27;t simply report on the 
&gt; incredibly fascinating
&gt; research we are doing without wanting creepy drama.

&gt;&gt; For whom do you write? Where can we read some of your previously
&gt;&gt; published material?? Based on your question, I&#x27;m assuming you aren&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; looking to do the field of EVP/ITC or other paranormal research any
&gt;&gt; favors. What is your intention???
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; How about focusing on something positive? That would be a nice change
&gt;&gt; of pace from the media. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find anyone here that is
&gt;&gt; willing to help perpetuate the negative stereotypical views on our
&gt;&gt; research or other nonsense that is a distraction from the fact that
&gt;&gt; there are valuable EVP/ITC advances taking place.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyone ever get an elemental, demon, or otherwise &quot;inhuman&quot; voice?
&gt;&gt; Anyone hear from
&gt;&gt;&gt; someone with a dire warning? Anything else otherwise weird? I am a
&gt;&gt; journalist and would
&gt;&gt;&gt; LOVE to interview you about it!
