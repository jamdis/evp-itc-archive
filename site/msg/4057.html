<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Mike,

Today I modified my Radio Shack 12-469, but have some questions.  It 
was easy to do, and I instantly plugged it into my Olympus voice 
recorder and recorded off of it easily.  Now I want to pipe some 
white noise in (and ambient), as well. 

1) Is the set-up in your video what has worked best for you (with the 
computer and all)?
2) Will you tell us what free computer programs you used (I think one 
is Audacity)?
3) What microphone and white noise generator did you use for your 
travel pack unit pictured on UFOGeek.com (posted on December 8th)?  
And can you give me a layout for the wiring of it - you know, how it 
all hooks together?  I&#x27;ll figure it out sooner or later, but I&#x27;d 
rather it be sooner!

Thanks, LC

&gt; I am currently putting together another video, just like my others 
&gt; showing a very practical way to use the Radio Shack Hack devices.
&gt; You probably saw my 12-469 practical use videos, now I&#x27;m going to 
be 
&gt; sharing a 12-470 practical use video.  This one is of a totally 
&gt; portable system that uses a noise generator, the hacked 12-470, a 
&gt; digital (or analog) recorder, and a microphone which gathers the 
raw 
&gt; audio sweep, white noise (or in my case a special white/pink noise 
file 
&gt; I created), and any ambient noise within a chamber.. and places 
that 
&gt; session int a .wav file.  It also includes an ear piece so you can 
&gt; hear, real time, what the digital recorder is recording (the mixer 
of 
&gt; the session sound within the chamber).
&gt; Stay tuned for that video later today....
&gt; 
&gt; - Mike
