I am a believer in the afterlife and a believer =\r\ninspirits attempting to communicate with us for a variety of reasons. Ihave=\r\n spiritual beliefs that I feel strongly about and devote much ofmy waking (=\r\nand sleeping) moments to thoughts about this field.However, I am also a res=\r\nearcher and a skeptic. In order for me toallow ideas to become part of my r=\r\neality I must experiment. In orderfor me to believe something is paranormal=\r\n I HAVE to rule out all otherpossible causes. That being said, I have some =\r\nquestions. My hope isthat there are some here willing to enter into discuss=\r\nion with me.I have a difficult time with many of the files here. Many times=\r\n, thereis no question included in the file. I can not determine whether orn=\r\not the &quot;reply&quot; is an intelligent reply. Maybe this has to do withallowable =\r\nfile size.Some of the files I have been able to download. (I don&#39;t always k=\r\neepmy email settings on for this group as I get too many - lol) When Ilook =\r\nat the file I see problems. There will be complete flat linesilence between=\r\n the words. Many times the &quot;reply&quot; is also at the samedecibel as the questi=\r\non askers voice. Those two things should notoccur naturally considering the=\r\n devices being used. That tells me thatthere is manipulation of the files. =\r\nNow, what is manipulation to me,may not be manipulation to others. To me, a=\r\nny altering of the recordedfile constitutes manipulation. I do not know if =\r\nthe reply wasintelligent or manipulated to be intelligent. Some say that th=\r\ney simply remove the &quot;no response&quot; time. I&#39;ve beentold it can be as much as=\r\n 18 seconds removed from between words. Nowwe run into the problem of us de=\r\nciding what word fits in with thequestion. What words are being ignored? Di=\r\nd we take nonsense and makesense? Did we amp every noise/word or only what =\r\nfit?I think it&#39;s great that files are offered for peer review. However, Ith=\r\nink we have to load them untouched or at the very least, offerexactly what =\r\nwas done to the entire file. Time elapsed between words,what was amped, etc=\r\n. I&#39;d also love to see some of these sessions videotaped with the question =\r\nasker facing the camera and a second handclock visible. Truly, we aren&#39;t re=\r\nsearching if we don&#39;t have someprotocol in place.Here is an issue I have wi=\r\nth the RS Hacks. I have the 469. It takesapproximately 18 seconds to scan t=\r\nhrough the AM frequencies. Now, thetypical person would think that we can t=\r\nake that 18 seconds and divideit by the number of AM stations to determine =\r\nhow long we are on eachstation before moving on to the next one. In that wa=\r\ny we coulddetermine what is impossible to be said via a radio fragment. How=\r\never,that&#39;s not correct. The scan cycle can vary from one frequency to then=\r\next and of course the biggest problem is that some stations arepicked up ov=\r\ner multiple frequencies; AM 640 can be heard on 630, 640,650, 660 and maybe=\r\n even 670. That extends the time a great deal. Thisis a difficult problem b=\r\necause it is almost impossible for the averageperson to be able to make a d=\r\netermination on time this way. I heard about the following today; An experi=\r\nmenter records at the sametime every day Mon-Fri. We hear about the importa=\r\nnce of meditating,automatic writing, etc at the same time every day but wha=\r\nt we have toremember with this, is that now we are in essence tuning into t=\r\nhe sameradio show every day. One of my first experiments with the 469 had m=\r\nehearing this deep male voice over and over again. What was he tryingto tel=\r\nl me, I wondered. Than I realized that he was speakingapproximately every 1=\r\n8 seconds; every time the scan hit that station.So, if you are removing up =\r\nto 18 seconds between words, then you arereally only recording the words fr=\r\nom one station. This post is IN NO WAY trying to start anything besides dis=\r\ncussionabout some research problems. I know that there are those who are no=\r\ntconcerned with anything more than the communication itself but I thinkthat=\r\n it is of the utmost importance to attempt to factor in someprotocol in ord=\r\ner for this to be considered serious research at all.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________=\r\n____________________________________________________\nClimb to the top of th=\r\ne charts!=A0Play the word scramble challenge with star power.\nhttp://club.l=\r\nive.com/star_shuffle.aspx?icid=3Dstarshuffle_wlmailtextlink_jan\r\n--_b04affce-6d27-4639-830b-ce2dda1d4968_\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;\n.hmmessage P\n{\nmargin:0px;\npadding:0px\n}\nbody.hmmessa=\r\nge\n{\nFONT-SIZE: 10pt;\nFONT-FAMILY:Tahoma\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body class=3D&#39;=\r\nhmmessage&#39;&gt;\nBabs,&lt;BR&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;\nYou know it&#39;s really amazing,&lt;BR&gt;\nany time=\r\n you decide to pop up here &lt;BR&gt;\nIt always seems you have an issue with some=\r\nthing.&lt;BR&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;\nthis time it&#39;s files without questions, the length of=\r\n the RS scan&lt;BR&gt;\nblah blah blah.&lt;BR&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;\nDidn&#39;t your mama tell you &quot;=\r\nIf you can&#39;t say nothin nice don&#39;t say nothin at all&quot;&lt;BR&gt;\nI&#39;m sure we could=\r\n all do without your bi monthly criticism.&lt;BR&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;\nBruce&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;P align=3Dcenter&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D4&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0033cc&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT c=\r\nolor=3D#000000 size=3D5&gt;Bruce Halliday &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://free-paranormalinvestigating.com/%3C/div%3E%3C/div%3E%3Cp%20/%3E=\r\n%3Cdiv%20class=3D&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUO=\r\nTE&gt;\n&lt;HR&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;From: babiarz3@...&lt;BR&gt;Date: M=\r\non, 21 Jan 2008 15:34:01 +0000&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Babs has Issues!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;Microsoft SafeHTML&quot; name=3DGenerator&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3DEC_ygrp=\r\n-mlmsg style=3D&quot;WIDTH: 655px&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3DEC_ygrp-msg style=3D&quot;PADDING-RIGHT=\r\n: 15px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; Z-INDEX: 1; FLOAT: left; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; WI=\r\nDTH: 490px; PADDING-TOP: 0px&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3DEC_ygrp-text&gt;\nAlright, you all kno=\r\nw I&#39;m vocal and I haven&#39;t made any &quot;friends&quot; here&lt;BR&gt;but, if we can put tha=\r\nt aside for a moment...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirit communication has been my passion sin=\r\nce day one, a little over&lt;BR&gt;6 years ago.
