Leading Vatican theologian Father\n&gt; Gino Concetti said it is no longer a sin, as long as mediums, \nfortune teller\n&gt; and palmists are not involved.\n&gt; The pronouncement\n&gt; came after Italian magazine claims that contact with the spiritual \nworld had\n&gt; produced miracles. Father Concetti dismissed that,  but added: &#39;We \ncan\n&gt; pray for our loved ones. They will respond in dreams and \ninspiration. In one\n&gt; example, a grandmother advised a girl about her marriage choice in \na dream. The\n&gt; girl did not heed counsel and a grave problem developed. If we pray \nseriously\n&gt; in a quiet place, with our hearts and our voices, the departed will \nexpress\n&gt; themselves and advise us.&#39;\n&gt; (Printed in the LondonDaily\n&gt; Mail, 29-Nov-96)\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  \n&gt; Recently Father\n&gt; Concetti, one of the most competent theologians in the Vatican, \nsaid in an interview:\n&gt; &#39;According to the\n&gt; modern catechism, God allows our dear departed persons who live in \nan ultra -\n&gt; terrestrial dimension, to send messages to guide us in certain \ndifficult\n&gt; moments of our lives. The Church has decided not to forbid anymore \nthe dialogue\n&gt; with the deceased with the condition that these contacts are \ncarried out with a\n&gt; serious religious and scientific purpose.&#39;\n&gt; (Printed in the Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, date\n&gt; unspecified)\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  \n&gt; The Pope explains to\n&gt; us &quot;What actually happens to us at the moment of death?&quot;\n&gt; This question has\n&gt; occupied mankind for centuries. Jesus promised that a final \njudgment will come,\n&gt; an all-last day. But what occurs to the souls of those who die \nbefore this\n&gt; point in time?\n&gt; Pope John Paul II\n&gt; explained it in Rome\n&gt; before pilgrims. He said:\n&gt; &#39;One should not\n&gt; think life begins after death only with the final judgment. Quite \nspecial\n&gt; conditions prevail after natural death. It concerns a transitional \nphase in\n&gt; which the body dissolves and where the life of a mirror-image \nentity (the soul)\n&gt; begins.&#39;\n&gt; &#39;This entity is\n&gt; equipped with its own consciousness and its own will, so that \nhumans exist,\n&gt; although they no longer possess a physical body.&#39;\n&gt; A member of the\n&gt; international papal theological advises: &#39;At the moment of death \nhumans make an\n&gt; enormous discovery. The soul does not only leave the body, but \nhumans discover\n&gt; the secret of time.

Go figure. \n&gt;  \n&gt; My wife listened to the recordings and says she can not hear the \nresponses.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I no longer discuss box research outside the EVP/Paranormal \nfriendships I have.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Its just like UFO&#39;s. Some people believe they exist and others \nbelieve they are military test vehicles.\n&gt;  \n&gt; For the past week and a half, I have been assisting Juli in a \nmissing person case, and have been doing the box recordings for her. \nI conected with the boy right away who has been missing for over a \nyear, and the info he has given us is info only the police detectives \nknow, as it has not been released to the press. The boy has answered \nevery question posed to him.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Either you believe in spirit contact or you do not. Some people \nbelieve in God and others do not. \n&gt;  \n&gt; It seems to me the people that do not believe in spirit contact \nwhether through a medium, box devices or personal experiences, are \nthose that have never had an experience.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have had a handful since my youth and adult life, and from the \nfirst one I had, I was hooked and never looked back.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Mike Edwards\n&gt; \n&gt; Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Well said Margaret\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rees\n&gt; \n&gt; itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@ aol.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Kay. Your boyfriend&#39;s opinion is one of the reasons why I put \ngreat weight on relevance \n&gt; of content in a session. For example, when I recently asked for \nRees&#39; great uncle to say \n&gt; his name, and an immediate reply of &quot;It&#39;s Chuck Clarke&quot; is heard \n(even though Rees \n&gt; referred to him as Charlie, both are nicknames for Charles) I think \nthe odds would be quite \n&gt; astronomical of that being coincidence. Same goes for any of us \nasking a question, any \n&gt; question, and receiving a relevant response ... it would be highly \nunlikely for it to be from \n&gt; stray signals (of whatever flavor.) \n&gt; \n&gt; Then again, if he has trouble even hearing and/or agreeing on the \ncontent, it&#39;s going to be \n&gt; hard for you to get him to view an answer as relevant, even when it \nis. \n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@ ..&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have let my boyfriend listen to some of my files.
