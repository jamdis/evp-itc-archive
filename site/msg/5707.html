&gt; &gt; Robin,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s never a good idea to invite any spirits into your home.
&gt; &gt; Some demonic spirits have to be invited in before they can
&gt; &gt; enter, there are instinces where people have heard knocks on thier
&gt; &gt; front door only to answer the door and have no one there.
&gt; &gt; The knocking by an entity and the opening by the physical being
&gt; &gt; symbolises the request to come in and the invitation of the open
&gt; door.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you give out a ready made invitation, it could be like that
&gt; annoying
&gt; &gt; relative that comes to visit and never leaves.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So be very careful whenever summoning any unknown entities.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you need help with your box research or have any questions
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t hesitate.

&gt; &gt; Yes Bruce, &quot;We want to kill you&quot; is word for word what I hear.
&gt; Thank you for being the first person ever to validate this for me,
&gt; because now I know it&#x27;s REAL, I&#x27;m not crazy, and it isn&#x27;t my
&gt; imagination. This was captured on a digital voice recorder while I
&gt; was heating coffee in the microwave oven nearby, and I felt that the
&gt; microwave must have been a powerful energy source for the &quot;speaker.&quot;
&gt; It may be important to note that I had just invited spirits inside
&gt; the house from outside, and that after I listened to this message I
&gt; told them to go back outside because they were too rude to continue
&gt; talking to. I&#x27;ve tried to replicate this experiment a number of
&gt; times since then (without the verbal invitation into my home) and
&gt; have had no luck whatsoever.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Gleefully moving on to box research!

&gt; &gt; Robin, In the evp file you posted I believe I&#x27;m hearing &quot;we want to
&gt; kill you&quot;please let me know if that is what you hear. Robin, I am
&gt; glad to hear that the protection ritual will be utilized by you in
&gt; the purpose it was intended. To give any individual that wants to
&gt; anopportunity to use it. You will find many forms of interaction on
&gt; this group, running the gamut from total agreement to calm
&gt; debate /discussion. To full blown arguments. That is what makes a
&gt; group, If everyone followed one single ideology and the ideas of any
&gt; single person without questionit would not be a group it would be a
&gt; cult. Welcome to the wonderful world of box research robin, I&#x27;m sure
&gt; you will be a valued member and researcher in this community. Bruce

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m still giving this topic a lot of thought because I absolutely
&gt; believe in the power of prayer, the power of positivity, and the
&gt; power of ritual. When I first started recording EVP a couple of
&gt; years ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when it
&gt; happened to me I felt elated rather than frightened or distressed. I
&gt; will ask again: What physical or psychic harm is a disembodied
&gt; entity capable of doing? Please listen to the one EVP I&#x27;ve posted on
&gt; this board and tell me what, if anything, you hear. I know what I
&gt; hear, and I consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is the
&gt; response that has created the determination in me to continue
&gt; researching the unknown.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings. I only want to learn as
&gt; much as I can from you and the other dedicated researchers on this
&gt; board. It never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in the
&gt; past, and that&#x27;s about all I can say. I will probably use one from
&gt; this point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract
&gt; goodness.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So, thank you for this contribution. I think the debate has been
&gt; an excellent one, and I&#x27;ve appreciated the opportunity to be
&gt; enlightened.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I swore I would not get wraped up in this debateBUT!The reason I
&gt; came up with this whole protection ritual was that some of the new
&gt; researchers whereexpressing a rational concern for negative responces
&gt; that they were recieving through thier boxes.The short protection
&gt; ritual that I posted is not meant to quell irrational histerical
&gt; fear, and I agreewith rosemary that anyone suffering from such fear
&gt; should rethink thier involment in the paranormal research field.that
&gt; being said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal comfort to
&gt; those new individuals that had never expperienced spiritual
&gt; negativity. And to help ease them into aproaching a session
&gt; eventually with confidenceand determination as well as full
&gt; curiousity for all types of the communication we recieve.My initial
&gt; post of the ritual file was done with the best of intentions and
&gt; meant to be another tool available for those who felt they needed or
&gt; wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer ritual, I don&#x27;t
&gt; think it is really worthy of all this debate.Use it, don&#x27;t use it.
&gt; It&#x27;s there if you want it. Also I must say there are two kinds of
&gt; fear the kind that is natural and a god given emotion for self
&gt; preservation, ie the fright and flight reflex that is an instinctive
&gt; trait in all of us. Then you have the irrational dibilitating phobic
&gt; fear that can turn an individual into a frozen statue. That type of
&gt; fear I believe is unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt with and
&gt; learned how to harness. I also believe that anyone that harbors that
&gt; type of fear would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a
&gt; case of such fear it would already be present and doing a small
&gt; protection ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take it for
&gt; what it is, something to utilize in our box of tools like an emf
&gt; meter.you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the bottom of
&gt; your tool box at home that you inherited from your grandfather and
&gt; have never usedbut if you come across that odd nut that needs
&gt; tightening somedsy you will be glad you have it.Bruce
