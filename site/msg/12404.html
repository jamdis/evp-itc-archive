&gt; I have 2 of Frank&#x27;s boxes. It&#x27;s as simple as some are drawn to use them and 
&gt; some aren&#x27;t.
&gt; I don&#x27;t know many who bring neg. results. That can happen to even the nicest 
&gt; people. What I can&#x27;t stand
&gt; is people tagging certain areas of research with unnecessary drama. I 
&gt; wouldn&#x27;t use the term &quot;faint of heart&quot;
&gt; for certain. As for Moon&#x27;s statements, if those are accurate, they are 
&gt; illogical. Anyone can do this research, use Frank&#x27;s
&gt; boxes, or whatever and they wouldn&#x27;t need his guidance.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone can use one of Frank&#x27;s boxes. Results vary. No drama. Many things can 
&gt; happen with this
&gt; research, but outlandish results are rare and can easily be dealt with.

&gt;&gt; I could agree that box research
&gt;&gt;&gt; isn&#x27;t meant for everyone nor is it everyone&#x27;s cup of tea. Reckless use
&gt;&gt;&gt; can bring negative results and that is a very real possibility, so
&gt;&gt;&gt; definately not for the faint of heart.
