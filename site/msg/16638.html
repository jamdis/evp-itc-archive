<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, having recently lost three family members, I&#x27;m sorry, too.  My deepest and sincere sympathies to Debbie&#x27;s family and friends.

&gt; &gt; Keith at ITC Bridge sent a memo stating Debbie Caruso passed last night.
&gt; &gt; Some of you may know of Debbie&#x27;s work through the AA-EVP or her many tv
&gt; &gt; appearances, or perhaps her website http://www.1800heaven.com/aboutme.htm
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I met her at the 2006 AA-EVP Atlanta conference and witnessed how she could
&gt; &gt; easily record and playback evps right on the spot for people that were
&gt; &gt; curious about evps. She was one of the 1st people that I met that seemed to
&gt; &gt; be an evp magnet. She made a real contribution to the field and her work
&gt; &gt; will always be appreciated.
