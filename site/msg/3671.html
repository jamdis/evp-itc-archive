<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Everyone,

this is for the entire group. After reading Steve&#x27;s post it dawned on 
me that he is 1000% right in saying that this has gotten out of hand.

I do not personally know Chris moon and any slurs I have made upon 
his character I apologize. I do not agree with the statements he made 
about box research and the people that are doing it, even though I 
may not agree with what he Say&#x27;s but I have shed my blood for his 
right to say it.

to babierz and lance, forgive my fowl language and the name calling 
sometimes my temper runs way ahead of my brain. 

in closing let me say it is the Christmas season and I for one will 
try to adhere to the old saying &quot;good will toward men&quot;

lets continue our research with no animosity.

thanks
Bruce</pre>
