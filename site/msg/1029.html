<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>when you get tired of seeing impossibly pink smoke coming out of 
computer you can go to weirdstuff.com and get $79 dollar dual p3 
server (you will have to get some USED ecc memoryfrom ebay--dont buy 
the new stuff)  i promise that tyan masterpiece will make your other 
electronics behave, too.  you will be dumdfounded at how FAST 1.2 ghz 
can be.  windows 2000 professional is only operating system that 
works.  you need a free reg cleaner &quot;advanced windows care&quot; (google 
it)

you will have no more burns.

alternatively,

you can get fast , LOW VOLTAGE xeon cpus, dual server board like

tyan i7501, (only use tyan and only server board) and 
UNDERCLOCK!!!!!!!  , yes thats right, for a 3 gig i underclock to 1.6 
ghz.  hyperthreading must always be disabled ( unless you want to be 
a slave to cooked cpu or unless you have &quot;otto&quot; handy)

my ultra low voltage dual xeon running at 1.6ghz beats the pants of 3 
gig p4 in every test that matters

&gt; Thanks for the advice Misty! Ive learned my way around computers 
over the years, but this is too weird and it definnitly corresponds 
to how much Im progressing with the contacts I am trying to maintain. 
Asking it to stop seems to invite worse. This interference has (I 
suspect) an intent and Ive found that the best fix is ignoring this 
stuff...in any case..Its good to know Im not the only one whos gone 
through this....so gathering my dignity...anyone here know if theres 
any reason to be concerned about EMF levels? I sure am getting mild 
flu like symptoms fairly regularly...used to be &quot;not so mild&quot;
&gt; Light,

&gt; Not uncommon in this work Monki. If ya lived close enough I could 
fix it for ya but not sure where on the east coast you are residing 
(yes guys I can fix pc&#x27;s LOL =P but no that doesnt make me the tech 
type...practice makes perfect). I went thru two computers in a months 
time, fried everything completely right down to the last chip. 
Appliances dont last long at my house (near me) and tv&#x27;s, vcr&#x27;s, 
backups units...u name it I have fried it. It finally stopped when I 
asked them to stop whatever they were doing that was putting so much 
pressure on my machinery. Now they say Otto is in charge of 
equipment, and havent had much problems on my end. 
&gt;    
&gt;   Email weirdness is also common I have watched mine and others 
emails disappear, then sometimes show up later with changes made in 
the wording of the message. Retro Dave has bore the brunt of the 
email problems LOL I just had it happen once when I responded to his 
postings of having problems.  My post disappeared then came back 
changed/edited. Thats been a long time ago tho. 
&gt;    
&gt;   After saying all that you should of course check the basics, make 
sure everything is plugged up properly, see if anything feels 
extremely hot (if it is shut it down immediately to cool) then ya may 
wanna pop the lid off the tower of the pc to check inside and remove 
the sound card, clean the contacts, then replace it to see if that 
helps. UNPLUG IT FROM ELECTRIC FIRST! If that doesnt help then you 
may need to replace the part. Keep an eye on temperatures if 
something is running hot sometimes it will cause the metal to 
swell/bend/melt/move.

&gt;       Hey,
&gt; I am having an unbelievable time with fried equipment. Now my sound 
is blown! No speakers or headphones work. I heard a pop and then
(silence is not always golden for us evp types!) I have been through 
alot of hardware this month! Thats not mentioning screwed up 
software, digital recorders and sound files and emails that just seem 
to go missing! I hear from other researchers that this is not 
uncommon.Im losing stuff quickly. Ill be outta business before long! 
Is there a safeguard for this? Anyone had these things happen to them?
&gt; Ive wondered if emf protection might be in order...I hope I dont 
sound completely madd!(besides, its the Madd Hatter thats got that 
covered. Im actually more like Alice...clueless! So...SOS!
&gt; in other  words...
&gt; HELP!
