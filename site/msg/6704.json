Not trying to open another can of worms here, just wanting to =\r\ncontinue learning from your experience and research.  I get what you&#39;re say=\r\ning about becoming obsessive with the sessions.  I&#39;ve probably asked you th=\r\nis a half dozen times over the last couple of years, but who or what do YOU=\r\n think you&#39;re/we&#39;re  communicating with?\n\nRobin\n\n\n  ----- Original Message =\r\n----- \n  From: purplespacefriend&lt;mailto:purplealiengirl@...&gt; \n  To: EV=\r\nP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n  Sent: Saturday, Fe=\r\nbruary 02, 2008 7:46 PM\n  Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: File from tonight\n\n\n  Have=\r\n ya tried EVPmaker?
