Content is certainly important, though the process around that I think can =
also be 
problematic.

Let=92s say you go to a location where someone named=
 =93Origami Taganatchi=94 is said to have
died.=A0 Using EVP direct questio=
ning, you ask =93Is Origami Taganatchi here?=94. And you get 
an EVP of =93=
Yes=94.=A0 Does that confirm that this person is here, since it was an answ=
er to a 
direct question?=A0 Or maybe you get some unexpected answer, like =
=93I am happy=94.=A0 Was that
an answer to the question?

Why not ask a rea=
lly direct question, one which you already know the expected answer 
and so=
 can better test the contextual response, and rule out EVPs that are irrele=
vant, like 
=93What is your first and last name?=94.=A0 If you hear a clear=
 =93Origami Taganatchi=94, that would 
seem a very good EVP, with contextua=
l relevance.=A0 But I=92ve noticed this kind of 
confirmable question is ra=
rely if ever asked.=A0 What are the most common questions?=A0 Yes 
and no.=
=A0 And what is the easiest word to interpret out of noise?=A0 =93Yes=94.

=
So my concern here is that some people asking the questions can actually, e=
ven 
unconsciously, form their questions so they can acquire vague or subje=
ctive answers, 
rather than asking specific, testable, non-subjective quest=
ions with clear expectations for 
a correct answer, since those seem to ret=
urn less results.=A0

I would know=
 by the content.  As a ham radio operator, I could identify 

anything said=
 as being from that source. (Frank S is also a ham.) CB 

transmissions wou=
ld also be easy to identify by the content.



And when I ask a question li=
ke "Are there others here with you?" and get 

an answer like "You bet," or=
 if I ask "Are you happy?" and get a response 

"Course I'm happy" (actual =
EVP's I've gotten), it's a pretty good chance 

those are exact answers to =
the questions I asked.



As for the radio station, it was a continuous rec=
ording on mine.  I could 

hear the DJ talking, the intros to the music he =
gave, the music, the 

connercials, everything.  I doubt you are only going=
 to get a single word 

or few words from a radio station close by if it is=
 getting into your 

unit. And I suspect a ghost isn't going to be doing an=
 ad for the local 

car dealer!



Also, I didn't mention in my last post t=
hat I tried the experiment with my 

recorder within a couple blocks and th=
en at increasing distances from the 

radio station towers. At a quarter mi=
le away or more I couldn't hear it in 

the recording.  I also tried the lo=
cal police and some microwave towers, 

right under the towers, and heard n=
othing from those sources. But they 

are on much higher frequencies than A=
M or FM radio and are not known to 

get into any electronics around here.
