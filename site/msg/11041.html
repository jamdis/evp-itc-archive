Cool it all went thru that time to group but failed to send private, Weird. Didnt work first time for group nor first time for private. Too tired to figure that one out tonight LOL just see attachments (hopefully all went thru fine they appear to be attached on my end). I am like you I got a little send happy when it wasnt working LOL but hey eventually somethin worked somewhere. Forgive me if 5 more copycat messages come thru later LOL.

  No last name on that guy yet tho. But I do find some of the other things said in that session to be of interest in part because they talked about speaking to you this year. I was gonna post this to group but files are a bit over limit of attachments so just sending in private. I think you have a couple already since they were about you.
