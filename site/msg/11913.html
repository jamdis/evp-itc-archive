<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s because of her work and some of Frank S.&#x27;s stuff that I have to  
wonder if there are 2 &quot;Fish Groups&quot;. One good and helpful and the  
other not.

Yeah, it&#x27;s a good site. I think we&#x27;re all mediums to a lesser and  
greater extent. Some seem to have a natural knack at being sensitive  
and some don&#x27;t - some are in between. I tend to feel it&#x27;s a talent  
like being a natural musician, singer, or artist. Some have it  
naturally, some don&#x27;t, some can learn by being taught, but aren&#x27;t ever  
as good as the naturally gifted.

&gt; w. I just finished a couple hour review of the web site you sent for  
&gt; Sandra Belanger at http://www.heliumraven.com/home    Man did that  
&gt; answer a lot of questions I had about how this technology can work  
&gt; with mediumship/spiritualism.  Also renewed my hope in working with  
&gt; evpmaker.  The case history that Sandra recounts on the site should  
&gt; be a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone serious about evp.itc.  I would like to  
&gt; understand more about the relationship between evp and mediumship.   
&gt; Does a &quot;good&quot; evper need to be a &quot;sensitive&quot; or medium or does it  
&gt; just give someone with the sensitivity the edge over someone else?   
&gt; Even Sandra now says that she had a certain amount of &quot;sensitivity&quot;  
&gt; before she started using evp technology and that now she actually  
&gt; &quot;communicates directly&quot; with spirit.  To me that means she is a  
&gt; medium....no?
&gt;
&gt; Also, regarding the Fish Group...I was taken back to read on her  
&gt; website that The Fish Group was helpful in having her &quot;solve&quot; the  
&gt; Lacy Peterson case.   Chalk a good deed up to The Fish Group.    
&gt; Thanks for the web site.  Ron l
