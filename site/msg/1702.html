<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>hi every one,

I have stumbled upon a new form of itc that I call visual projection 
imaging or VPI for short.
I came upon it after noticing that the afternoon sun shining through 
a crystal window in my home projected onto the walls and surrounding 
objects and I noticed a slight movement of part of the reflection and 
after closer scrutiny I noticed if resembled a face. I got my digital 
camera and snapped a few pics after loading them onto the computer 
and adjusting the brightness and contrast to cut the sun glare this 
is what I found and have been capturing better and sharper images 
since.
I have experimented with crystal itc in the past with moderate 
results that&#x27;s when you shine a light through a quartz crystal and 
take pics of the crystal the spirits actually use the natural energy 
of the crystal to form an image inside of the crystal.
I believe that VPI is the same premise only it is projecting through 
the crystal and onto the walls much like a movie projector sends 
light through a film cell and in turn projects it onto a screen.
I will try to re create this phenomenon in a controlled experiment 
using a quartz crystal and a full spectrum light source.

I have done many images this way, If you visit my website you can see 
some examples of the images as well as a step by step example of the 
enhancement process.I wiil post a couple of pics here in my folder.
