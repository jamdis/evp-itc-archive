If anyone wants to see \nit you have to download the PCBExpress software at www.PCBexpress.com. The \nsilk screen markings are for assembly purposes, and won&#39;t be on this order, \nso I didn&#39;t care if there was some over lap. There&#39;s no way to mark the \nlayout underside components, but I have my notes for that. All components \nare from mouser.com.\n\nEven though the layout is labled &quot;RVG&quot;, it is in fact linear and random, AM \nand FM, with stereo input and output (except for the monitor speaker). There \nis provision for both wire, and bar antennas. The board was made extra \ncopmpact to reduce cost, I wanted to keep the two boards under $100, the \ncost was about $93. With silk screen and solder mask, they would have been \ndouble.\n\nAfter endless hours staring at the screen, my eys are about fried, I have a \nspot in the right eye, that hopefully will clear up.\n\n\nButttttt Boring Frank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMore photos, more messages, more storageï¿½get 2GB with Windows Live Hotmail. \nhttp://imagine-windowslive.com/hotmail/?locale=en-us&ocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_mini_2G_0507\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_6db8_6118_19b2\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream; name=&quot;Production-2007-SMT-RVG.pcb&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;Production-2007-SMT-RVG.pcb&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_6db8_6118_19b2--"}
