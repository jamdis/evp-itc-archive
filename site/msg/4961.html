I might actually title this essay &quot;Why I no longer care about Randi&#x27;s 
One Million Dollar Challenge,&quot; but honestly &quot;So What!&quot; sums up my 
feelings these days.

Over the last several years, I&#x27;ve been somewhat outspoken about the 
specific details of the rules of Randi&#x27;s challenge. But recently, 
when being harassed by yet another disbelieving type about the test, 
some kind of light - an epiphany of sorts - went on in my head. The 
individual made a statement, with a question, that I often hear in 
variations from self-described Skeptics (actually disbelievers): 
&quot;The Amazing Randi offers one million dollars for anyone who can 
demonstrate something paranormal. If psychic abilities are real, why 
has no one won the prize?&quot; 

Rather than responding as I have in the past with a discourse as to 
why I don&#x27;t believe anyone will win that money, I spontaneously 
switched gears. [The following is an approximation of the 
conversation] 

&quot;What would that prove?&quot; I asked.

&quot;Huh?&quot; said the Skeptic.

&quot;Why is Randi offering the money?&quot; I asked.

&quot;For anyone who can prove something paranormal,&quot; said the Skeptic. 

&quot;If someone did win the million, what would that actually prove?&quot; I 
asked.

&quot;Huh?&quot; said the Skeptic.

&quot;I mean, if a psychic won the million dollars, other than the psychic 
walking away one million dollars richer, what would that prove to the 
skeptical community or to Science?&quot; I asked.

&quot;That someone could do something psychic,&quot; said the Skeptic with some 
confusion in his voice.

&quot;Would it? If someone won Randi&#x27;s million dollars, would YOU accept 
that psychic abilities are real? Or even just possible?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;Huh?&quot; said the Skeptic.

&quot;Would mainstream Science accept the probability of psi, if not the 
reality, if some psychic won Randi&#x27;s million?&quot; I asked.

&quot;Uh-uh-huh?&quot; said the Skeptic.

&quot;Would the organized Skeptics accept that psi is real, or would they 
be more likely to believe that Randi was simply fooled, scammed out 
of his million? Would you?&quot; I asked.

I received a blank stare from the Skeptic, then saw confusion 
appearing on his face. 
I continued to push at him. &quot;The fact is that people who do not 
accept the laboratory and other evidence for psi that already exists 
are unlikely to change their minds or their beliefs simply because 
someone beats Randi&#x27;s challenge and wins Randi&#x27;s money. In the name 
of Science, many keep raising the issue of parsimony, of Occam&#x27;s 
Razor where psi is concerned. In this case, wouldn&#x27;t the simpler 
explanation as far as the Skeptics are concerned be that Randi was 
scammed out of the money? In the name of Science, many raise the 
issue of repeatability. If someone beat Randi&#x27;s Challenge once, how 
does this meet the criteria of repeatability? What does this prove?&quot; 

The Skeptic was silent, confusion and frustration (and a little 
anger) continuing on his face.

I finished with &quot;If you can honestly tell me - I mean look me in the 
eye and tell me honestly - that you would be open to psi&#x27;s existence 
if a psychic won Randi&#x27;s money, I&#x27;ll give you 20 dollars right here 
and now. It&#x27;s not a million, but to be honest, your opinion isn&#x27;t 
worth that much to me.&quot; 

He walked away (okay, he stormed off).

I&#x27;ve since used this argument on a few others, whenever Randi&#x27;s 
Challenge is raised like a weapon against the field of 
Parapsychology, and against the existence (real or just potential) of 
psi.

To recap: If someone wins Randi&#x27;s million, he/she will be one million 
dollars richer. However, as far as Science and the Skeptics are 
concerned, the simpler answer to this conundrum is that Randi (or his 
chosen panel of judges) was fooled. 

In other words, So What if someone wins the money. It won&#x27;t change 
the prevailing attitudes towards parapsychology, or the prevailing 
beliefs of most who waiver to the disbelieving side of the center 
where psi is concerned. 

As this is the case (prove me wrong, somebody - please!), we waste 
our time even giving Randi&#x27;s Challenge the time of day. 

It&#x27;s not a benchmark for Science, or even the Skeptics. Why should we 
care?

So What!
