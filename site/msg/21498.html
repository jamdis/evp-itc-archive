"What Is Horse Cri=

"What is Horse Cribbing?  
=E2=80=9CCribbing=E2=80=9D, also known =
as =E2=80=9C_wind  sucking_ 
(http://www.horsecribbing.com/wind-sucking/) =
=E2=80=9D, is the act of a horse gripping an edge such as a wooden  
fence,=
 grain bin, metal round pen, stable door, etc., with his front teeth,  
arc=
hing his neck and swallowing air.  
This act of swallowing air creates a gr=
unting or belching noise. Note that  
cribbing and wood chewing are not the=
 same. Some horses will chew on wood  
without arching their neck or suckin=
g in air.  
The last thing that a stable owner needs is a cribber. A cribbi=
ng horse can 
 drive even the strongest horseman to his knees in frustratio=
n. Not only is 
it  obnoxious to witness, cribbing can also impair a horse=
=E2=80=99s long-term 
health and  cause significant damage to a stable.  
T=
he bad news is there=E2=80=99s no =E2=80=9Cmagic bullet=E2=80=9D to overcom=
e a cribbing problem  
since what may work for one may not work for another=
. But there=E2=80=99s an 
assortment  of remedies that just might solve you=
r horse=E2=80=99s vice. But first things 
first,  what causes a perfectly h=
ealthy and supposedly normal horse to crib?  
So far it is believed that th=
e two major causes of horse cribbing are:  
* Boredom
* The example set by =
other cribbers in the stable 
By nature, horses are grazing animals. So whe=
n they=E2=80=99re forced to remain  
within a stall for long periods of tim=
e without hay to graze on, they=E2=80=99ll  
eventually become stressed. Th=
is stress leaves them open to picking up a vice to 
 distract their idle mi=
nd.  
So the easiest measure you can take to prevent your horse from turnin=
g into 
a  cribber is to ensure your horse doesn=E2=80=99t stand idle all d=
ay and become 
bored. One  step you can take is to consider much more frequ=
ent yet slightly 
smaller  portions of hay instead of feeding three huge fl=
akes of hay a day.  
Another measure is to look into finding horse toys tha=
t can entertain your  
horse while he=E2=80=99s not eating or you could con=
sider salt licks for his =E2=80=9Cdown 
 time=E2=80=9D. Of course, the most=
 ideal solution is to set him out to pasture.  
Unfortunately, this isn=E2=
=80=99t an option available to most stable owners. 
The second major cause =
of cribbing is the example set by other cribbers.  
Horses are herd animals=
 and so they tend to observe =E2=80=95 and more importantly  
imitate =E2=
=80=95 each other=E2=80=99s actions. If a horse watches another horse crib =
for  
extended periods of time (especially an idle observer) then there=E2=
=80=99s a good  
chance the observer will also copy the behavior he sees. S=
ome horses will  
dismiss the cribber and never pick up the vice. But it ca=
n be an extremely  
contagious habit. If it=E2=80=99s possible at all, a st=
able owner should isolate a  
cribber from the rest of the herd.  
Cribbing=
 can be an incredibly difficult habit to break a horse from once it 
 is al=
lowed to take root. The reason for this is two-fold:  
* Cribbing is believ=
ed to be an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
*  Cribbing is a natural hi=
gh 
Cribbing is more than just an obnoxious habit that can damage your 
pro=
perty.  It is a vice that can create long-term health problems for your hor=
se. 
The most  obvious health issue for cribbers is their teeth since the c=
onstant 
grinding of  teeth against wood, plastic or metal wears them down =
at an 
abnormally quick  pace. A long-term cribber can grind his front teet=
h down so 
low that a gap  exists between the upper and lower teeth even wh=
en the jaw is 
completely closed.  
It is also commonly believed that cribb=
ing can ultimately lead to an  
increased chance of _colic_ (http://www.hor=
secribbing.com/horse-colic/) , 
flatulence, and digestion problems due to t=
he  air that=E2=80=99s swallowed. For this 
reason, there are some equine i=
nsurance companies  that will refuse to provide 
insurance to a horse that =
exhibits this vice. They  simply don=E2=80=99t believe the 
increased risk =
of health issues is worth it.  
Some recent studies have questioned this co=
mmon belief, suggesting that 
only  a small amount of air is taken in durin=
g cribbing that actually reaches 
the  stomach. The researchers suggest tha=
t the increased colic and flatulence 
aren=E2=80=99t  directly attributed t=
o the cribbing itself, but rather to secondary 
factors such  as worn teeth=
.  
When a horse=E2=80=99s teeth are worn down to the point they can=E2=80=
=99t properly grind 
the  food, their digestion will suffer significantly. =
As a result, this 
leads to an  increased chance of colic. So no matter how=
 you look at it, 
cribbing can impair  a horse=E2=80=99s health significant=
ly, particularly over the span of 
a lifetime.  
If you own a cribbing hors=
e, then don=E2=80=99t despair! There are a variety of  
products or techniq=
ues that you can use to help you overcome horse cribbing in 
 your stable. =
