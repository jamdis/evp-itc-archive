                  I'm not trying to say I know how a=
 spirit could record on an analog recorder, or if they can at all: my point=
 was that it wasn't reasonable to assume it could directly change the bits =

                  But, =
were I to conjecture, one might say that the air pressure of a voice is con=
verted to a signal that modifies the magnetic properties of a tape.  And a =
line recording uses a signal, not from the mic, but from some other source,=
 to do the same.  So if that signal were to be manipulated via external EMF=

                  Since =
we are also assuming that digital recorders can pick up spirits, then the s=
implest explanation is that that same up-front signal (before it gets digit=
ized into bits) is also being manipulated.  And an EMF source could theoret=

                  However, it may be that an EMF source strong enough to =

                            Your po=
ints seems to be that you can make it work without knowing how it works.  S=
o we need to talk about what you mean by that.

                           =
 When you use the microphone, you just speak, and let the recorder do the r=
est.  In this case, you are using the recorder without really knowing how i=
t works.   If a spirit can manipulate the EMF field around the AtoD convert=
er (even without using the mic), then they should be able to do the same: j=
ust use it without knowing how it works: the recorder does the rest.  In ne=
ither case do either of you need to know how it works, to get it to work. I=
 am not questioning this.

                            But, if they are goi=
ng to change the bits on the actual media themselves, then they must know h=
ow it works, it order to get all those bit-things I mentioned right.  The r=
ecorder can't "do the rest", because by changing the bits on the media them=
selves, they are going completely around what the recorder does, and doing =
the details themselves.  And as I said, the details there are very technica=
l, and include things like converting their words into digital samples of g=
roups of a specific number of bits in a specific format on specific places =
in specific orders with other specific other bits connected to them like fi=
le ownership and dates and such.  It is the job, basically, of a computer, =
not a person.

                            If they are changing the bits on=
 the media, then the recorder is not doing that.  They are no longer lettin=
g the recorder "do it", like you or they would be if they just used it norm=
ally.  The reason you can "make it work" without understanding it, is becau=
se the recorder is doing the work for you.  If they are to change the media=
 directly, then the recorder is no longer doing the work, and so they must =
understand all those digital issues.

                            So that i=

 not being able to use it.

=E2=80=A6



                                Well in this conversation with=
 my mom after not speaking for a year I told her what I had found out.  Whe=

n though the audio was recorded the previous day.  I proceeded to go back t=
o reviewing the audio and the very first thing I heard was:  THAT WAS SUPPO=
SED TO BE A SECRET =E2=80=93 YOU LIED.

                      2 different things happening-that' s why. When you ge=
t EVP that everyone understands,  it is outward, in the environment. Not a =
communication through subconscious means.



                              =
  EVP that people swear they hear, but noone else can make sense, may be a =
message to them via subconscious means. That isn't to say that ALL EVP's li=
ke this are true messages, I am sure alot are just matrixing.



          =
                      But then that is how the art of scrying starts-matrix=
ing. Like the Rorschach tests. The images you matrix with those gives the p=
sychologist an insight into your mind.



                                B=
y gazing into a dark, reflective surface, you start to see cloudy images. A=
t first, you will just be matrixing faces in the clouds and not getting muc=
h substance. Try it, you will see what I am saying. With practice, you star=
t to see clear, concise images.



                                I think =
that is what happening with audio as well.



                             =
   We already know for a fact pareidolia can occur in audio as well as visu=
al stimulus.

         I think that is the problem I am having though Jim.  When you say =
"work them over till you hear them"  to me I should not have to work them o=

as I said, the details there 
                            are very technica=

       without understanding it, is because the recorder is
