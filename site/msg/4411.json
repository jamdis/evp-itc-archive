I suppose this forum could take a turn away from the tech side if we really got into analysis of all messages.  Yet, I can&#39;t NOT think about meaning...if you know what I mean.  Particularly when it comes the major earth change stuff that can affect my kids.  If not appropriate for this group please send me direct email on any EVP that might suggest any pre-warning signs we might look for before the big bang.  As an aside, let me say that I have been with and am currently with other groups discussing such issues but I am quickly putting great value in what is being shared here.  I like the direct approach rather than the he-said-she-said theorizing.   Thanks again Frank.\n\nFrank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:           I usually don&#39;t ask questions, not even with EVPmaker, but there \nseems to be coded dates that point to 2012.
