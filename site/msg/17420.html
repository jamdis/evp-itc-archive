<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>What I mean is the mean spirited, nasty negative self proclaimed skeptics that use &quot;science&quot; as an excuse to accept nothing, and attack anyone that does not buy into thier agenda. These people claim to be scientific, or to use scientific reasoning, yet accept no evidence, and when evidence is presented they go on the attack. That BS is no longer going to be tolerated here. It&#x27;s one thing to present an opposing view, such as hearing the voices or seeing images differently, or not at all, but these charactor attacks are way beyond anything resonable.  

 You can&#x27;t claim science and accept no evidence whatsoever then claim the moral and intelectual highground. Go to JREF for that!

&gt; Frank, I think you&#x27;re confusing science and scientists. Science is supposed
&gt; to be a body of knowledge that can explain all known phenomena and predict
&gt; new ones not yet observed. That&#x27;s all it is. In a few rare cases, a landmark
&gt; piece of work does just that.
&gt; 
&gt; One example is James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise on Electricity and
&gt; Magnetism.&quot; Not only did it explain all electromagnetic phenomena observable
&gt; (except a couple which were explained by refinements) but it predicted
&gt; things not known at the time Maxwell wrote it. Like Vivaldi antennas.
&gt; 
&gt; Scientists are supposed to look for holes in the existing theories and
&gt; improve on them so they can explain all phenomena. An example is the Bohr
&gt; theory of the atom. It did a great job of predicting the spectral lines of
&gt; hydrogen - the Lyman, Balmer, H series etc. But it didn&#x27;t do so well
&gt; explaining the spectral lines of things like uranium. So other theories had
&gt; to come about. And they did. They do a pretty good job of explaining
&gt; existing phenomena and predicting as yet unknown phenomena but they still
&gt; have their flaws.
&gt; However, it is true that some scientists have adopted certain arenas of
&gt; science almost as religions. But note physics deals with PHYSICAL things -
&gt; it says so right in its name. So does chemistry. It&#x27;s great if you want
&gt; better batteries, automobile engines or radios. But we&#x27;re dealing with
&gt; something here on this group that&#x27;s non-physical. To the best I can
&gt; determine, EVP and ITC are produced by spirits. These spirits transcend the
&gt; physical and only use the physical universe for their own purposes.
&gt; 
&gt; Evidently the one thing they love to do is comunicate, whether it be from
&gt; within a human body or outside it or from who knows where. And they are not
&gt; predictable. Science, in dealing with the physical, is not going to explain
&gt; any of this phenomena. Very little is actually known in the realm of
&gt; spirits. Mostly what I see is beliefs. Everyone seems to have their own
&gt; beliefs in this arena; some agree and some conflict. But no one seems to
&gt; have any proof of anything that would take it out of the realm of belief,
&gt; except that the phenomena do exist.
&gt; 
&gt; I wish I knew how the EVP voices can make words that appear at twice or half
&gt; the rate of normal speech, talk backwards, etc. I&#x27;d like to learn those
&gt; tricks! And I still don&#x27;t know what to think about shadow people. I have
&gt; seen them with my own eyes many, many times. So have others I was with. I
&gt; haven&#x27;t been successful at photographing them. For some reason the ones I&#x27;ve
&gt; experienced can be seen by human eyes but not photographed. Science lets us
&gt; down on that one. A lot of people think shadow people are evil but I have
&gt; never felt that from them. Again, that&#x27;s a belief. No one has proof of it. I
&gt; have felt &quot;evil&quot; from other things. Maybe I&#x27;ll tell you about one of these
&gt; &quot;things&quot; that was existing in someone&#x27;s attic once. Man, talk about an evil
&gt; presence! But I never got that from shadow people.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for going on so long; I just wanted to point out that science and
&gt; scientists are not the same thing and that science has indeed given us some
&gt; things (like Velcro cable ties - the greatest invention of whatever century
&gt; it was invented in).

&gt; &gt;  No difference between the skeptic and the religious twits, try to force

&gt; &gt;&gt;  Wow! I am amazed.That&#x27;s pretty much what I heard! Very rare! See the
&gt; &gt;&gt; skeptics acuse people of only hearing what&#x27;s labled, and we just had another
&gt; &gt;&gt; round and round about that last week. Thanks!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Frank,

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Very interesting. It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve listenend to your files.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The fm on this tuner sounds really active; the Others are definitely chatty
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; on this band.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; This is what I hear (in studio grade headphones):
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Your AM file @ 03 secs: &quot;Here Prin Cess&quot; (male + two escalating tones)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; @ 11 secs: &quot;Be sure (static) good news&quot; (male)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Your FM file @ 01 secs: &quot;Trying to get through&quot; (in female tones)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; @ 03 secs: &quot;It don&#x27;t ?boost? right&quot; (male then two tones)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; @ 05 secs: &quot;Closer to cooperating?&quot; (male, first vowel sound is hard and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; second vowel sound in this word is a soft &#x27;a&#x27; or &#x27;o&#x27; so it cannot be
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; calamity)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; @ 06 secs: &quot;Till we&#x27;re done&quot; (female, fast)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; @ 08 secs: &quot;Frank&quot; (male)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; @ 09 secs: &quot;Hi&quot; (female singing, drawn out)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; @ 11 secs: &quot;How you doing&quot; (male)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; @ 14 secs: &quot;Hi&quot; (female or child)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
