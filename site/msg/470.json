I really can&#39;t think of anything at all that would convince them.  When they have such a mind set, even if they sat right there in front of you and heard it as a Class A directly on playback, they would have a justification for it not being EVP.  We know what you are doing is real, and people like Gary Schwartz from the University of Arizona knows what we are experiencing is what we say it is, so I say let the debunkers have their say and ignore them.  It takes all kinds.  Good work you&#39;ve been doing Frank.   Keep it up.
