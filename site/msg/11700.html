Look at the videos Mike posted at ufogeek.com

He has 3 radios running through a mixer, plus a mic. White/pink noise mixes on the computer. I honestly don't know. Anybody else know anything?

LOL, not as far as I know, but then I'm the one asking because I'm not
getting any results so what do I know?

It generates a bunch of noise on it's own so I wouldn't think any more
would be necessary. It was my understanding that the messages come
through "whomever" manipulating the radio voices as it rapidly goes
from station to station.  I'm just recording what comes through the
radio.

Am I leaving out some important step?
