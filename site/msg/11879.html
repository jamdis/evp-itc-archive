Chad,
If you went to the cemetary with H.Analyst, I probably know which one=

you went to.
There are some not so nice things that happen at that cemetar=
y.....

I haven't experienced the EVP/ITC, but many=
 cemeteries have guardians
that 
try to ward you off in various ways. From =
my experience, if they finally

decide you're not there to do harm they wil=
l kind of back off and leave 
you alone.

A simple thing like straightening=
 a skewed tombstone or cleaning up a
mess 
will convince them you're not th=
ere to harm. Also, tell them that you're

not there to do damage.
