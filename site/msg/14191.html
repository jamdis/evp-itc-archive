  OK=
...I did my test with a 4.43 MB wav file.

  I experienced no noticeable lo=
ss, and the file was the same size before and after being emailed.

  That =
still doesn't prove that maybe in some situations loss is possible.

  But =
again, like RJ, I have never experienced it myself.

          A file's content, it's integrity, is simply the bytes=
 (and their bits) in the file.  If the file's content integrity is changed,=
 that is, by definition, changing the bytes.  If the bytes in there are not=
 changed, then that integrity has not changed.

          It is possible to=
 mess with other things about a file (like its name, its suffix, or its own=
ership) but this does not effect the contents, and so would not affect that=
 integrity, or the sound of the file (assuming you could read it at all aft=
er changing the ownership, or the suffix, etc).

          When you do your=
 tests, if you cannot do a bit level comparison, I would recommend at least=
 checking the file sizes.  If they are identical, there is a very high prob=
ability that the content has not changed.

            I have not tested it from m=

            But I will test it from my side. I will send =
a wav file to one of my other addresses. Then I will download and compare. =
If I think I hear a difference, then maybe I can have you do a bit-level co=

            Either way, I am going to get to the bo=

                    Yes you can tell loss of qua=
lity by a bit-level comparison.  An audio file is just a file of bytes, tha=
t is later interpreted by an audio player.  Two files with the exact same c=
ontents, whether they are audio or image or a dababase or an exe, are indis=
tinguishable from each other.  That is, if I copied the contents of one to =
a new file, and the contents of the other to a new file, and asked you whic=
h file each came from, there would be no way to tell.  Even the audio playe=
r could not tell.  The data is identical, and so the sound (or the picture,=
 etc) would be identical.

                    Yes I did listen to the resu=
lts, but that is not the best test (they sounded identical, but that is a s=
ubjective opinion).  The real test is compring the contents.  Identical con=
tents means indentical data, means identical audio.

                    It=
 is probably possible to set up an email compression scheme that does do lo=

                                I used to thin=

                                Again though y=

                     The kind of compression that occurs during an email at=
tachment is "lossless": it compress the file cleverly without losing inform=
ation.  For example, if I had a program in some .exe files, and I sent it o=
ver email, it could compress it.  But if it lost even one bit, the resultin=
g exe file would not execute again after it was uncompressed on the other s=
ide.

                                This kind of compression does things =
like looking for common patterns in the file, and replacing them with a tok=
en.  A rough example would be if it found "Howdy Neighbor" in a file 20 tim=
es, it could replace all the occurances with say $HN1.  And also write a li=
ttle dictionary in there someplace that says "$HN1=3DHowdy Neighbor".

    =
                            When the file gets to its destination it can be=
 uncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are replaced with "Howdy Neighbor=
".  So it was compressed (instead of 14 characters each, it only needed 4, =
plus the dictionary), but lost no data.

                                So=
me formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not lossless.  Depending on the level of=
 compression, some level of data is lost, and so cannot be recovered or rec=
onstructed later.

                   =
             So even if you have attached a wav. file, it will loose resolu=

                            The only exception to this is if the wav. file =

                                Pixe=
lization doesn't clean-up the data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking a pictu=
re of a field of flowers, and beginning to add levels or pixelization to th=
e picture.  Soon, you would not be able to tell there were flowers there at=
 all.  You would see a lot of colored blocks.

                            =
    Or in the other direction, imagine you are looking at a competely rando=
mize bunch of pixes on your screen: a complete screen of truely random stat=
ic snow.  Pixelizing this, after a while, you would again start to see colo=
red blocks.

                                What's happening is that it is=
 processing an area of the image, taking (for instance) the average value o=
f that entire area, and replacing all the blocks in that area with the aver=
age.  In video processing, this would result in a field of multi-colored fl=
owers being replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish block, with no =
resemblance to flowers.  In the noise example, it maybe replace all the ran=
dom pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.  If you did not know befo=
rehand what the original picture was, you couldn't tell whether your pixeli=
zed image was really a field of flowers, a chevy, the sky with clouds, or a=
 random bunch of pixels.

                                It works the same=
