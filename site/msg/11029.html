<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Everyone,


I have been to lots of haunted places like Gettysburg, Eastern State 
Penitentiary, and many other documented haunted places and have not 
captured any evp&#x27;s at all. Just wondering if it is just me or am I 
doing it all wrong? I bring a voice recorder that uses a standard 
recording tape and can&#x27;t hear anything unusual. Any suggestions on how 
I can try to get some voices would be great. I am open-minded to the 
spirit world and have seen spirits but not heard from them. Would like 
to try to capture some voices. Any suggestions would be great!

Thanks very much,

Jan</pre>
