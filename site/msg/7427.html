<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Wanting to be less negative sounding, I can&#x27;t rule out producing the 
boxes some time in the future. I just can&#x27;t provide any and do the 
testing and problem solving I need to do.

&gt;                I think your input is very important, hell you are 
the inventor!  As far a people taking what you say to be negative, 
well if they do oh well they will get over it.  I personally don&#x27;t 
think there are any experts, which is my opinion for what it is worth 
and I am sure I will catch hell over my statement.  I for one can not 
say or confirm who I am talking to, nor will I ever be able to (well 
maybe when I&#x27;m dead) if they are in fact spirits from the other side 
or other life forms from different planets.  I do however know that I 
love the communication who ever they are and pretty much have to 
leave it at that.  I think this is what makes it so fascinating to 
me, that so much of the communication we receive is unknown in 
origin.  You have taught us that we should take this as it comes, and 
not hold too much truth to some of the messages.  
&gt;    
&gt;                  You for one designed each an every box 
differently, having its own unique features about them.  From white 
noise generators, to random, to lunar, etc..  You adapted them as you 
went, so if anyone has experimented the most in this field, I would 
say it certainly would be you.  The never ending days and hours you 
have spent creating these devices truly surpass all of us combined 
time in the research end, so I don&#x27;t think I have to say anymore 
there.
&gt;    
&gt;    I can only speak for myself, but I feel that your contributions 
are extremely important and are needed.  You have helped and touched 
peoples lives many you will probably never know of or meet.  It is 
because of your desire and constant dedication with your building of 
perfection that you have allowed us an opportunity to experience what 
you do knowing that there is more out there than just us, in our 
selfish world of our.
&gt;    
&gt;   Hell I&#x27;m calling it a good day when I can turn my TV remote on,  
so I know I certainly count on you for your experiences in obtaining 
the best communication!

&gt;            I was going to make comments about box use, but so far 
it always falls on deaf ears, and gets taken as being negative, so 
screw it, the &quot;experts&quot; can hash it out. What would I know, I just 
make the damn things?! BTW, for the above reasons, not making boxes 
fror anyone. I don&#x27;t care what you want to use it for, or how 
quailified anyone thinks they are.
