I asked stefan if i could put the program on a palm pilot, he said only if it runs C+ software.\n\nI never got it to work, but it&#39;s worth another try.  It&#39;s a windows based program.\n\n-Steve\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Wonder if it&#39;s possible to do a droid app to run EVPmaker on the android\n&gt; phone or an iphone. I think it&#39;s time to move this audio ITC in a more\n&gt; better direction. The boxes work, but the problems, like no signals in rural\n&gt; areas, noise, static and highly distorted audio make it poor at best. With\n&gt; practice you can get two way commo.  I think it&#39;s best to record with\n&gt; EVPmaker and the boxes. Then listen.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
