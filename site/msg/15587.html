I think you all did a great job and the samples you used were good examples=
 whether ya said what they were or not. Radio hosts tend to want their show=
 to run their way and for their guests to follow their planned itinerary. I=
f people dont like that go start your own show, do it your own way. It wasn=
t a science experiment it was a talk show. With any evp method it comes dow=
n to one simple idea, that is to try it yourself and get your own results a=
nd prove it or disprove it for ones own self.=A0Everyone may not agree with=
 what you hear but its not an ego contest (for most) for who can get the be=
st evp its about learning theres more out there than what is visible to the=
 naked eye and sharing your experience with others so that they too can try=
 it for themselves. There are many methods and tools for communication and =
anyone who wishes to learn more can do so on their own. 
=A0
Like Debbie sa=
id you either believe it or you dont. You either want to try for yourself o=
r you dont. It isnt up to us to prove or disprove the validity of it, it's =
up to you the individual to come to your own conclusions for your own tests=
 and your own experiements.=A0There are people who=A0run around all day yel=
ling I saw a UFO but until you see one for yourself you=A0may just think th=
ey are nutcases. Even=A0if you see one you still may not believe it. That i=
s your decision to make. We cant make it for you.

Hey thanks to Steve Hultay and the =

as the desire of Frank and myself to play the audio samples WITHOUT providi=

 blind evaluation of communication but rather a radio show meant to introdu=
ce Frank and his pioneering work in a personal way to the audience and allo=
w listeners to hear swept tuned device files. It wasn't the proper forum fo=
r an indepth study, it was meant to be a virtual meet and greet between Fra=
nk and the Darkness Radio listeners. -Bill Murphy
