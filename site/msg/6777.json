I get very \nfrustrated when not one box user will just let the things work, \ninstead it&#39;s always ask questions, and pre-judge everything. I think \nwe influance what comes through more than anyone here wants to \nbelieve. \n\n Then to have people that don&#39;t know squat about how the box works, \nor anything about electronics presume to tell me how it really works--\nwell, I can only take just so much of that without ripping someone&#39;s \nhead off. \n\n All these years on varous groups and forums, and it&#39;s one arguement \nafter another from those that want the paranormal to behave according \nto some preconceived rules. I have a completely different approach to \nthis stuff, and if it&#39;s wrong--how come it works?\n\n As far as getting proof--I don&#39;t need it, I see, hear, and feel \nspirits from time to time, I know life goes on.\n\n I have no idea what I&#39;m trying to say here. I don&#39;t want that \nargumentative, this is the onlyest way crap stuff anymore. My boxes \nwere not the first, or the best, it just one more method of many. \nWhen someone says such and such is the only way, I want to jump down \ntheir throat cuz that&#39;s wrong. Can&#39;t seem to keep that grumpy old man \nlocked in the basement!\n\n Frank"}
