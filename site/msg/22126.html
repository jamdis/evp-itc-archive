<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The purpose of the box--aka a swept radio is to provide a source of broken
speech and other sound--known as raw audio--a term borrowed from EVPmaker,
which the entities use to form their voices. All these self proclaimed
geniuses and experts making all kinds of claims about how they improve the
boxes, have no clue about how it works. It&#x27;s only function is to develop
raw audio, it make no difference how the sweep is done, it can be done by
hand, it can be just a very small portion of any given radio band, it can
just tune a radio between stations on a night when there is skip, distant
stations fading in and out. Radio is just one way of developing raw audio.

 So, explain to me how some over complicated sweep mode  is going to make
an improvement. If ya want self aggrandizement, go over to Hultays group,
RTSC.

 True, I don&#x27;t support ghost hunting, cuz I think it&#x27;s a focus on darkness,
but that doesn&#x27;t mean the boxes don&#x27;t work in those conditions, and there
aren&#x27;t any valid responses from it.  I can turn on a box anytime day or
night, and someone--disembodied--presumably, is right there to start
talking, even with the lights on. When I see the BS on TV, everyone sitting
in the dark--I&#x27;m thinking what is wrong with these people!? When someone
says they need boxes or that kind of research, I am not going to take you
serious, it means you have no idea what this is. You think spirit is some
kind of mindless zombie stuck in abandoned buildings--pure Hollywood! That
haunting idea is so ingrained, and programmed into people that y&#x27;all would
rather believe I am some lying thieving SOB than question your reality.

 I don&#x27;t need this crap, I do this &quot;research&quot; for my own curiosity, and I
still believe it was a mistake--a huge mistake-- to share the box idea.
Humanity has no clue how to use it, what it&#x27;s for, and it ain&#x27;t to make one
rich and famous.

 Besides, who the hell is anyone to say what the boxes and EVP tell me
about myself and who I am, as well as a verity of topics,  to say they know
better?
