<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce .. Are you speaking to the box and responding to &quot;real time&quot; 
answers or do you have to play it back to hear their answers?  Just 
asking because I need to play my recordings back to hear responses ..

Debbie

&gt; Mike,
&gt;  
&gt; I usually start with asking if they will please join me in a 
communication session. If you have a technician and or spirits that 
communicate
&gt; with you on a regular basis, and know their names, greet them and 
thank them for their efforts in communicating and to please send any 
messages
&gt; or respond to any question that you have, and you will do the same. 
Also ask that they block any negative energy or communication or 
spirits themselves 
&gt; from coming through the box. then proceed with the session.
&gt;  
&gt; At the end I ask that any spirits that may have come through the 
open doorway the line of live communication may create, go back 
before the box is turned off.
&gt;  
&gt; wait to here verbal conformation from the other side that it is 
clear to turn the box off. the responses I usually get are Clear, 
Good, Okay or words to that effect.
&gt;  
&gt; I thank my friends for their efforts and say my goodbyes and 
announce that I am turning off the box. I turn it off and the session 
is done.
&gt;  
&gt; Some researchers feel comfortable as I do saying a short protection 
prayer before a session and some do not believe it is necessary. the 
choice is yours.
&gt;  
&gt; I have posted a short protection ritual in the file section of my 
other group, it is there if you need it.
&gt;  
&gt; the link to the group is  
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP_ITC_Researchers/ just go over 
and join.

&gt; Hi all, and hope you all had a good Easter!
&gt;  
&gt; I keep listening to everyone&#x27;s recordings and since they are clips 
of what you are doing, my question is how do each of you start a 
recording to even get these responses?
&gt;  
&gt; I write procedures and education instruction, and I am missing this 
piece.
&gt;  
&gt; So you pull out the radio
&gt; You plug in the external speaker
&gt; You turn the radio on
&gt; Then set the recorder to record
&gt; But how do you start the recording?
&gt;  
&gt; I mean, do you start off by saying, &quot;hi everyone this is Bruce, or 
Kristn or Rhonda. Is anyone one there?&quot;  Or do you start calling out 
names, or do you even pray the night before that you plan to turn the 
radio on at 9am on such and such a date, or is it when you turn it on 
they are waiting for you?
&gt;  
&gt; Also lets say you turn the radio on, and a spirit says hi Rhonda!. 
From there what is your response? What types of questions do you ask? 
&gt;  
&gt; Is it more like a phone call to a family member, friend, or even 
just talking on a CB radio to truckers passing by trying to learn who 
they are etc.....
&gt;  
&gt; I am trying to step out a method for myself and it is frustrating 
me that I dont have a plan when I turn that rradio and recorder on.
&gt;  
&gt; Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!
