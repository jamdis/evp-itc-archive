that also are responsible for dowsing rods and the "DeChevrul pendulum"

The DeChevrul pendulum (T=

(DeChevrul) to probe the subconscious mind in the

also uses these subconscio=

I have done extensive experiences with the O=
uija Board. I have never been 
able to prove anything except that it is our=
 own minds controlling the 
device.
