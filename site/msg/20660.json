These\nare larger becasue I used a higher sample rate. This radio uses the LA1800\nchip, and it sound just like the TDA7000, kinda robotic when swept. The\nLA1816, and the TA2003 don&#39;t sound like this.\n\nF-s\n\nWonde i anyone hea his, jus o demo manual sweep again. \"They\" seem o s a alking mo e, bu i akes some ime o hem o shi gea s.
