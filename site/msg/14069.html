Well, maybe it's the guy that died, he never got around to perfecting, I  
can't think of his name, I thought it was a Frank.

Hmmmm, must not be me, I never worked with an Edison--dead or  alive. I 
don't believe in patents either.  It's a radio, already been  invented--by 
Tesla! All I do is sweep the tuning.  Tesla got ETs  too!

Hi Frank,
It was spirit that told us in 68 that you would build us a  "box," a watch 
like thing in order to talk with our loved ones."   <g>  I will pay you for 
one if you want, I would love to speak  with my loved ones over there if you 
don't mind.  Are you not the  inventor of the "Frank's Box"?  If so, You 
need to get a paten going  ASAP, I am not sure who has done what around this 
stuff but, they told us it  would be a Frank working with Mr  T. A. Edison 
that would be the  inventor, is this not you?  If not, I apologize, since I am 
new here, I  know there is one other man who has since crossed over, he 
worked closely  with Mr Edison as well.  What you folks might do is to get 
together,  create a group sharing paten on your inventions, with all the people 
that  are doing the testing's. you would all need to see a lawyer probably 
to have  one drawn up.  This way someone cannot come and steal your hard 
work,  because when this is perfected, it going to be a big deal.  It  will have 
something to do with a "cell."  I am a Christian  Spiritualist, and I look 
forward to having one of these, everyone will be  once you guys do the work, 
don't allow some other group to steal your hard  work away. Just a thought, 
sf

technological advancement is made by people trying an idea  to see what works,

You will never be able to prove your  methods scientifically, so why even 
try to argue with them? Even if you  were able to, they probably still 
wouldn't believe it.
 
IMO, who cares? All that matters is  that you are getting something out of 
it. Besides, maybe it isn't meant  to be understood by certain people. I 
have always held the opinion that  we will never scientifically prove anything 
we do in the paranormal  field, and I think that is no accident. I think 
some people will never  get anything out of it, while others will excel in 
their knowledge, but  it will be all very personal.
 
It's all about what constitutes  enough proof for you personally. You have 
to go with your gut on  what is true spirit communication, and what isn't. 
If no one ever agrees  with you, so what?

I was just sayin'!  So why would anyone in this field  completely ignore 
methods that work, irregardless of whether science  accpts it? That's the 
thing, say anything and I'm the one being  negative. Question these other 
experts and I'm being negative--on and  on. 
 
 Same old story--don't accept the evidence, don't accept  that that 
someone-like me-does in fact at least understand what  conditions to create to make 
these communications possible. Yet y'all  wonder why I have a case of the 
ass all the time. All the pompus self  proclaimed egotisical little dweebs 
out there chasing the damn fame  and fortune--not facts.
 
 I have gotten so much friggn' voices that can't be  explained as anything 
but spirits/entity communication-voices that can't be  

You hear that crap(any proof...) from every  scientist/debunker-from every  
scientist/debunker-<WBR>-well if the evidence was there we'd be the  first 
to celibrate it-yeah right, rihgt after they burned, burried,  and debunked 
it. There is more than eno  
 
 The stuff is simple-provide something for the enitities to  make their 
voices out of and they will speak, no friggin' mystery, no  magic, no secret 
tecnology, no high priest(ess) needed.

Frank, I think you misunderstood or misread something  somewhere. The 
AAEVP/Sarah Estep Research Fund is not for AAEVP to  do the research, it's for 
them to fund OUTSIDE organizations for  THEIR scientific research on the study 
of EVP. The Windbridge  Institute received some of this sponsor money for 
what they called  "Real-time EVP Conversations: A Pilot Study." The method 
for this  communication was *not* based on radio sweep, nor traditional  
methods, so it's not based on what I assume many people here are  doing. And in 
fact, it *was* based on the creations of someone  outside of the USA, so I'm 
a little confused as to why all the  hostility toward AAEVP for putting up 
the money.

Sadly, radio  sweep methods don't, and may not for a long time, get the 
respect of  the scientific community that it deserves (then again, seems no 
form  of EVP does), but at least this current research is a step in the  right 
direction. I hope, when Windbridge concludes their study, that  it will 
support the notion that there is apparent communication  formed in ways that 
cannot be explained by currently known and  understood laws of nature. THAT 
alone, in my opinion, would be a big  plus for all ITC communities, regardless 
of the method from which  that communication was received. What's the old 
saying? "It takes  but one white crow to prove all crows are not black." Any 
proof,  derived from any EVP method, would be greatly welcomed as far as I'm  
concerned.

            <DIV class=3Dh5>Frank, I think you misunderstood or misrea=
d something 
            somewhere. The AAEVP/Sarah Estep Research Fund is =
not for AAEVP to 
            do the research, it's for them to fund OUTSID=
E organizations for 
            THEIR scientific research on the study of =
EVP. The Windbridge 
            Institute received some of this sponsor mo=
ney for what they called 
            "Real-time EVP Conversations: A Pilot=
 Study." The method for this 
            communication was *not* based on =
radio sweep, nor traditional 
            methods, so it's not based on wha=
t I assume many people here are 
            doing. And in fact, it *was* b=
ased on the creations of someone 
            outside of the USA, so I'm a =
little confused as to why all the 
            hostility toward AAEVP for p=
utting up the money.<BR><BR>Sadly, radio 
            sweep methods don't, =
and may not for a long time, get the respect of 
            the scientific=
 community that it deserves (then again, seems no form 
            of EVP =
does), but at least this current research is a step in the 
            rig=
ht direction. I hope, when Windbridge concludes their study, that 
        =
    it will support the notion that there is apparent communication 
      =
      formed in ways that cannot be explained by currently known and 
     =
       understood laws of nature. THAT alone, in my opinion, would be a big=
 
            plus for all ITC communities, regardless of the method from w=
hich 
            that communication was received. What's the old saying? "=
It takes 
            but one white crow to prove all crows are not black."=
 Any proof, 
            derived from any EVP method, would be greatly welc=
omed as far as I'm 
            concerned.<BR><BR>Margaret
