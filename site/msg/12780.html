<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The only thing I know for sure is that if I-I personally-supply 
anykind of raw audio entities speak--for me--presonally. I can&#x27;t 
prove it, and I can sometimes share the voices. Some of these voices 
are exceedingly deceptive--askking questions of them--pointless, and 
usually they don&#x27;t answer me. There seems to be no universal rules, 
or knowledge on how this stuff works. 

 I think there are an almost infinate number of levels, or maybe 
demensions,  I think there is an almost infinate number of entities, 
some spirit, some something else, many non-human. 

 I think human spirit is not some deminished retard after death, 
stuck to some location, or object.

 There&#x27;s a pattern of people that actually know how to make the stuff 
that works-the spirit technology-they don&#x27;t hang out on groups! Even 
I keep my group e-mail turned off. 

 Frank--Sumption  I know it&#x27;s lots of trouble, but google that name!</pre>
