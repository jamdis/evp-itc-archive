<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s wonderful, Frank! I hope they are wrong on that, but they could be right. The clock is ticking, and I guess we&#x27;ll know soon enough.

As for annoying people and nay-sayers as far as the boxes are concerned, I&#x27;ve learned just not to read posts by those people. That way I don&#x27;t allow them to make me upset. If people want to learn about this field, that&#x27;s one thing. But if they want to trash it, and trash those of us trying to establish communication with unseen beings, I just don&#x27;t even read their posts anymore.

&gt;  Ok, I&#x27;ll just have to stop being such an old fart, ignore the crap that bothers me and move along. If my guys are honest, there isn&#x27;t enough time left for anything petty.
