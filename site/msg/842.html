I took a little time out to run a few short experiments with different types of sound. Music always has good results such as guitar so I thought I would go a step further and use the instrument which closest resembles sound the human voicebox makes. The oboe results were not as good as the satriani guitar results in fact the only words I found were located in the reverse of my own voice. Pretty much the same for me "singing" (I aint decided to inflict that sort of pain on the public yet LOL but I may post it to the page later). Tho that one did yeild a few impressive results that were clear and loud. I mean the sounds were good but I dont like my own voice comprisals I prefer sounds to be outside of reason or coming from somewhere else.
   
  Water sounds still tend to give off the most results in the lower frequency range. I find using that in combination with other bg sound to be useful. Anyway heres a few sounds I recorded from those different experiments starting with the oboe result..just a name. There was more something about "he says his moms in Boston" but was too fuzzy.
   
  What follows after is another session where they were trying to explain the "rules" of communication and finally just told him to shut up LOL. I included the part that a few of you may be able to hear.
   
  P.S. If you dont see them attached then you need to change your settings for the group to individual email so you can get peoples file attachments.
