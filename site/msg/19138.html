<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello everyone....

I was wondering if anyone had tried this piece of equipment to help them get EVP&#x27;s and what their experience was like (good, bad, neutral)? I have read some about the original creator or discover of this method for EVP&#x27;s. Anyway, I saw this listed on Ebay:

&gt;&gt;This device re-creates two authentic Raudive Diode circuits in one unit that you can record together using any stereo recording device with a microphone socket. Unique dual circuitry gives you two different receivers in one unit. Connects to a microphone jack on a PC or tape recorder.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Thanks very much for your help and/or input!
