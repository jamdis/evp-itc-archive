I  kinda dread it, cuz the work load, and demand may take off, along \nwith any privacy, and spare time I might have had, especailly since I&#39;m \nstill not prepared to mass produce this stuff.\n\nFrank\n\n\n&gt;From: William Murphy &lt;vilhellm@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Echo box contruction.\n&gt;Date: Mon, 12 Feb 2007 13:03:41 -0800 (PST)\n&gt;\n&gt;Hey Frank, are you close to Denver? As mentioned, I&#39;ll be arriving on the \n&gt;28th of March, and will return to pick up someone at the airport on the 1st \n&gt;of April, then I&#39;ll come off Estes Park on the 5th. Any of those days will \n&gt;work if it works for you. The 1st of April is particularly good if you&#39;re \n&gt;fine with that. I really look forward to meeting you.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Bill Murphy\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           Hi All;\n&gt;\n&gt;This is how I make the &quot;echo box&quot;. The frame is 1/4 inch poplar from Lowes,\n&gt;the foil in the heavy duty aluminum foil, and it is glued on with contact\n&gt;cement. You can see the mic and speaker mounted opposite each other on wood\n&gt;sides. The sides are 1/8&quot; plywood expoxied into the frame. It gives a solid\n&gt;mounting panel for the mic and speaker, and can be card board, as well. I\n&gt;try to avoid plasitc, as it seems to be &quot;contra-ghost voice&quot; if that makes\n&gt;any sense.\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get in the mood for Valentine&#39;s Day.
