Season Greetings!

The paranormal investigation group I founded, known as Denton Area 
Paranormal Society (DAPS), investigated a reportedly haunted home in 
Gainesville, Texas last Sunday. 

Amazingly, I have to say that almost every one of our researchers 
using audio recorders caught EVPs! We've recently become much more 
focused in gathering audio recordings at such places. Please click 
the link below, listen to the EVPs, and tell me if you agree with our 
interpretations...

Come here precious... BARK!</a>

I understand why some keep things under wraps, and I certainly 
respect that approach, too. That said, my take on paranormal 
investigation with DAPS is to openly share exactly what we're 
documenting on our investigations. 

In that regard, it's my pleasure to post a link to my best of images, 
taken on our investigations -
