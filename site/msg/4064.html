<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree on both counts and hope George will want to do a longer show 
soon.

Thanks Again,

&gt; Thanks, Lance.  I wish we&#x27;d had more time, and a better place for 
the
&gt; equipment.  Hopefully, there will be a followup on down the road.

&gt; &gt; Hi Rosemary,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We appreciate your insights and energetic efforts to put ITC in 
the 
&gt; &gt; spotlight where it deserves to be.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Lance

&gt; &gt; &gt; Last night’s C2C show with George Noory on Frank’s Box 
and 
&gt; &gt; similar ITC
&gt; &gt; &gt; devices went well despite the limitations of the broadcast 
studio in
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sherman Oaks, CA.  We were just too well shielded for the boxes 
to
&gt; &gt; &gt; scan properly.  I had on hand my Frank’s Ghost Box 22, Ron 
&gt; &gt; Ricketts’
&gt; &gt; &gt; very first Mini-Box to come out of production, the Radio Shack 
Hack,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and a Craig’s Box, a modified Daewoo car stereo done by 
Craig 
&gt; &gt; Telesha.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  In addition, I had a gold-beryllium alloy antenna made by 
Marcus 
&gt; &gt; Leader.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; There’s no doubt about it, the box technologies and spirit
&gt; &gt; &gt; communication are hot topics, and will continue to be in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; spotlight, especially as more people are able to obtain a 
device. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hopefully, this will lay to rest the nonsense about a 
“circle 
&gt; &gt; of 30”
&gt; &gt; &gt; or any such ridiculous claims of monopoly on who can and should 
use
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes.  Box technology is already democratic.  As more people 
obtain
&gt; &gt; &gt; and work with them, many possibilities for coordinated research 
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; experiments will unfold.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; As an interdimensional interface, the boxes are neutral.  They 
are 
&gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; dark, demonic, negative, etc., as some fearful people worry.  
&gt; &gt; Negative
&gt; &gt; &gt; experiences are always possible, just as in any work in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; paranormal.  People who don’t know what they are doing, who 
are 
&gt; &gt; in it
&gt; &gt; &gt; for a lark, and who harbor fears and anxieties about the 
paranormal
&gt; &gt; &gt; are not well-suited to any kind of paranormal exploration, 
whether
&gt; &gt; &gt; it’s with a box, in automatic writing, or with a deck of 
Tarot 
&gt; &gt; cards.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Rick Moran, the executive director of the Association for the 
study 
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Unexplained Phenomena, the sponsors of the research for the 
Mini-
&gt; &gt; Box,
&gt; &gt; &gt; shared some observations with me after the show that illuminate 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; topic.  Here are his comments:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a connection between every one of the 
designers/technicians
&gt; &gt; &gt; who have worked on the box from its inception by Spiricom. 
Every one
&gt; &gt; &gt; of them was a licensed Ham Radio Operator, including Frank, Ron 
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Myself.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Someone asked about different antennas… because of the Ham 
&gt; &gt; connection,
&gt; &gt; &gt; that has been done already. The original Spiricom was an 
enormous
&gt; &gt; &gt; device and operated on the ham bands because it was the only 
part of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the spectrum that could offer a clear channel. They tried both
&gt; &gt; &gt; vertical and horizontal antennas. We did the same in our early
&gt; &gt; &gt; devices, both Ron and I have “antenna farms” as do many 
of 
&gt; &gt; the ASUP
&gt; &gt; &gt; investigators, who are also hams.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Spiricom sounded very robotic, due in part to the equipment 
being
&gt; &gt; &gt; used… tubes and crystals to set the frequency. This was 
common
&gt; &gt; &gt; practice through the 1980s.  I recently heard someone spouting a
&gt; &gt; &gt; theory that because the Spiricom used a crystal system, it was 
&gt; &gt; somehow
&gt; &gt; &gt; mystical in nature. Crystals were used in all ham radios, all 
&gt; &gt; military
&gt; &gt; &gt; radios and a lot of commercial applications… nothing 
mystical at 
&gt; &gt; all.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think Frank dropped the crystal frequency generation due to 
cost 
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; favor of a plain old radio tuner he pulled from an old 
receiver. 
&gt; &gt; Most
&gt; &gt; &gt; of his designs were admittedly adaptations of junk radios, 
which is
&gt; &gt; &gt; what separates his from ours. We spared no expense in designing
&gt; &gt; &gt; circuits that were critical to a clean signal.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; In your discussion last night, George did not even mention the 
EARTH
&gt; &gt; &gt; SOUNDS project at NASA on the Ultra Low Frequency Bands. Down 
there
&gt; &gt; &gt; NASA has been hearing “voices” for years, which they 
admit, 
&gt; &gt; they can’t
&gt; &gt; &gt; explain. As you might have already guessed, that is one of our
&gt; &gt; &gt; upcoming projects. The great problem there is the length of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; antenna, to do it right an ULF antenna would be buried and 
would be
&gt; &gt; &gt; about 11 MILES long.  In the production model of the MiniBox, 
Ron 
&gt; &gt; hand
&gt; &gt; &gt; tuned the antennas, winding row upon row of fine wire to match 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; necessary length of the frequencies being scanned, another 
&gt; &gt; difference
&gt; &gt; &gt; that helped to eliminate noise and upgrade the voice quality.
&gt; &gt; &gt; ____
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, Rick.  And thanks to Frank, Ron, Craig, Marcus and all 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; other researchers in the ITC field.
