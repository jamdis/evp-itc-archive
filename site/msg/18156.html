Thanks to everyone who participated in Experiment 2.=


 

 On Friday, 7/16/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer monitor=
, right in front of me, and left it there until noon Denver time on Monday,=
 7/19/2010.   This experiment asked for participants to determine what that=
 object was. Vague or partial answers would not be counted (for example, ju=
st giving a color, shape, size,  what it's made of, etc): we're looking for=
 what it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won't cou=
nt.  Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other me=
ans they chose.  

 

 In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the =
object at the start of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (R=
J folder) of this group.  The idea with this file is that you could downloa=
d it at the beginning of the experiment and 'keep it safe' on your computer=
. Then at the end of the experiment, I would post the password so you can r=
eveal the contents of the file. That way, you were in control of the origin=
al image during the entire time, not me.  

 

 Passworded pdf: http://tech=
. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ20100716. pdf

 

 The passw=
ord for that file is: 2plus2isFour

 Instructions, if you need them for the=
 other files, are also in that RJ folder.

 

 So to the results:

 

 Numb=
er of participants: 6

 Total tries: 29

 Ambiguous answers: 0

 Correct an=
swers: 0

 

 Object: Chair

 Object picture: http://tech. groups.yahoo. co=
m/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ20100716. jpg

 

 As a little side experiment=
, on Monday I also asked if anyone had gotten any answers that might indica=
te an article of clothing (though I did not say why I was asking).   One th=
eory is that the human operator can be influenced by things they already kn=
ow or suspect, and so interpret audio with their own personal 'educated gue=
sses', that would differ from what they would hear had they not known those=
 things.  This side experiment did indicate some support for that theory, s=
ince before I mentioned 'articles of clothing', no one included an article =
of clothing in their results.  But after I mentioned it, several reports of=
 clothing began to appear.  I did not add these tries to the results above.=


 

 If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, l=
et me know. Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this experiment.
