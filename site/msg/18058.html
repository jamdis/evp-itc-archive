It sounds like you are saying if you are able to 'listen with an open mind=
', then you would be able to determine the object, I don't know if everyone=
 here would agree with you that they can't listen with an open mind: but th=
at's between you and them.

So far, all you've done is describe the ways in=
 which your technology doesn't work. 
I think we'd rather hear some of the =
ways in which it does.=C2=A0
