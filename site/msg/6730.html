Recently, I personally have migrated to more reader than poster.  

I&#x27;ve enjoyed my time here listening to all the ideas, receiving 
helpful information, support, etc.  Thanks, to all here beginning 
with Frank S.  I have received what I felt I needed, and gave what I 
felt I was to share.

I guess all of us have our own role and path. My intentions are to 
continue following my inner leading and experiment/create, 
accordingly. That is my guide, always has been, yet I know it most 
likely will differ from others - that&#x27;s what makes us all different 
and interesting in my opinion.  

I think it will be impossible to find one common idea, protocol, 
format, etc within this group.  That&#x27;s O.K.  If anyone would like to 
establish a certain group of common protocol, ideals, etc, that is 
certainly OK, too. I take no issue with personal opinions regarding 
any of this.  

Best wishes to the group and all the experimenters...

&gt; Frank surprised me yesterday, privately telling me he might come 
back  
&gt; to this list. I was hoping he&#x27;d pop up today and there would be a 
lot  
&gt; of joy. I was very excited this morning, for a few short moments,  
&gt; until I realized I&#x27;d already missed Frank&#x27;s return *and* his 
departure.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t know if he will come back again. And I won&#x27;t try to 
convince  
&gt; him.
&gt; 
&gt; But if Frank does come back, I hope you all can understand that 
you  
&gt; are all in the same place at this time *because of Frank.*
&gt; 
&gt; He doesn&#x27;t owe anyone an explanation for why he does what he does,  
&gt; with whom, and for whom. He doesn&#x27;t need to believe that anyone is  
&gt; more special than anyone or more deserving.
&gt; 
&gt; Things *are* getting a little messianic around here, HMO. And the 
one  
&gt; thing I can say from watching this field for 30 years is that  
&gt; messiahs come and go and never really are. What is are the little  
&gt; glimpses of life after death, in other dimensions, and seemingly 
all  
&gt; around us, invisible. That is the *only* verifiable truth of this,  
&gt; HMO: *Something* is out there and it will talk to you, if you let 
it.  
&gt; Beyond that, we are in no way prepared to make definitive 
statements.
&gt; 
&gt; No one should be asking Frank for anything at this point. He 
should  
&gt; be free to gift his boxes on whomever he feels is the one that 
should  
&gt; have it--or not at all.
&gt; 
&gt; Before anyone jumps on me, yes, I used to ask for a box from him,  
&gt; because there were no other alternatives then and because we had  
&gt; known each other on several other lists for about five years and 
were  
&gt; friends.
&gt; 
&gt; Bu now there are alternatives--lots of them. Buy a minibox, like I  
&gt; did. If that $400 price tag is too heavy, go to Radio Shack and 
make  
&gt; a hack. The radio, rechargeable batteries, and an adaptor cost us 
$70.
&gt; 
&gt; No one should be asking Frank for anything at this point. He 
should  
&gt; be free to gift his boxes on whomever he feels is the one that 
should  
&gt; have it--or on no one at all. He doesn&#x27;t owe anyone anything. He  
&gt; already founded this feast.
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, enough out of me. I&#x27;m going to go weep in my tea.
