I dont what\n&gt; everyones take is on this but I felt that some of moon and even Franks\n&gt; attitude was slightly arrogant. I am a researcher in the UK using old reel\n&gt; to reel methods and obtaining excellent results. I lost some family and some\n&gt; close friends 5 yeara ago and suddenly it dawned on me...what is life all\n&gt; about. I went on to research every evp pioneer i could, listen to hours/days\n&gt; of recordings and it changed my outlook on life. tears were turned to smiles\n&gt; and then I realised what all this research is for. it was a big step for me\n&gt; spiritually.\n&gt;\n&gt; I dont know if there is anyone else on here using old fashioned methods but\n&gt; if anybody would like to hear recordings please ask. I am using a reel to\n&gt; reel sony &quot;Hi frequency&quot; recorder and trying various types of tones,\n&gt; backgrounds e.t.c.\n&gt;\n&gt; Good luck to everyone with their research, you are right we are changing\n&gt; history we are discovering new things. if it wasnt for individuals such as\n&gt; raudive, jurghenson to name a few, maybe we wouldnt have discovered this. it\n&gt; takes a brave individual to tackle an arrogant human race blunted with\n&gt; science.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kind Regards\n&gt;\n&gt; The quiet one :-)\n&gt;\n&gt;  ------------------------------\n&gt; *From:* &quot;SnowfireL@aol. com&quot; &lt;SnowfireL@aol. com&gt;\n&gt; *To:* RTSC@yahoogroups. com; inside_the_box_ rtsc_talk_ radio@yahoogroup\n&gt; s.com; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt;\n&gt; *Sent:* Thursday, 4 June, 2009 20:25:26\n&gt; *Subject:* [EVP-ITC] Re: [RTSC] a copy of my final e-mail to Frank\n&gt; sumption I will go no further!\n&gt;\n&gt;  *Sorry to hear this Bruce, I sure hope things get better,  I had no idea\n&gt; there were so many problems when I joined all these lists,  I think you are\n&gt; all great people, you folks together are making history don&#39;t you all\n&gt; realize this?  There are so many people out there that have never heard of\n&gt; this type of communication, thousands out there!

I have made the same challenge to your friend moon\n&gt; who we all know is behind this tirade he has time and again refused or\n&gt; ignored the request for any type of audio file\n&gt; to be publicly posted for revue and continues to take advantage of innocent\n&gt; unsuspecting people with his con game and charging large amounts of money\n&gt; for sessions where he fabricates and makes up content as he goes along.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was the only one to confront him in public and expose him for the fake he\n&gt; is and this is his feeble attempt at retaliation. I and other researchers\n&gt; like me have brought this research light years from where it was when you\n&gt; and I first met, moon just continues to use it to rip people off and has not\n&gt; contributed a thing to the research of ghost box communication beside lining\n&gt; his own pockets.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just the fact that he has you doing his dirty work shows the type of guy he\n&gt; is. I can remember a time when you publicly came out against any type of\n&gt; money making using your boxes and even refused moon when he wanted to\n&gt; manufacture and sell them for large profits yet now you condone his robbery\n&gt; of innocent unaware people and actually act foolish on his behest.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank you are better than this, just concentrate on developing a better box\n&gt; and forget about moon and his tricks and lies, he is finished in the\n&gt; paranormal and he knows it, everyone is wise to his game and he is\n&gt; practically an outcast.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank you are hitching you wagon to a dead horse. Get away from these bad\n&gt; influences before they ruin your reputation as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; We have had this moon discussion in the past and once he has exhausted his\n&gt; need for you he will screw you again like he has done so many times before.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank, I like and respect you and I hope you will consider what I have said\n&gt; in this e-mail and I sincerely hope you post this one on the evp-itc group.\n&gt; I will be posting it on my group and others I belong to.\n&gt;\n&gt; Your former friend\n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------\n&gt; Limited Time Offers: Save big on popular laptops at Dell&lt;http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100126575x1221354145x1201369495/aol?redir=http:%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fclk%3B215221161%3B37268813%3By&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;\n\nI'd ag ee o ha .
