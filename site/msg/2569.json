I have \nuploaded the file online and am posting a link to it here for your \nreview, should you be interested. \n\nhttp://www.box.net/shared/static/rql6u514jt.wav\n\nA few things to note...\n\nI was on the phone with Chris for the duration of the reading.\nI asked to speak to my Grandfather, Reed Page\nIt is suspected that my Grandmother, Marilyn Page came through as \nwell.\nI did not pay for the reading.\n\nThe communication was important to me, but I make no assumptions or \nclaims regarding Moon&#39;s ability to interpret the information. I have \nspent a small amount of time with a box on my own, which I did not \nrecord, and which presented an entirely different experience.\n\nQuestions, comments welcomed :-)\n\n~April S."}
