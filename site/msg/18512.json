I also don&#39;t understand the vehemence of the comments to\n&gt; me.   All I can figure, is that some people here have had their deeply held\n&gt; beliefs attacked previously by those calling themselves or acting like\n&gt; skeptics or scientists.  They compare me to them, and so connect my tests\n&gt; and questions as heralding more attacks on their beliefs.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t in the least condone attacking people&#39;s beliefs, much less\n&gt; attacking them personally (as unfortunately people here are attacking me\n&gt; now).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Thu, 8/19/10, April Abercrombie &lt;\n&gt; april@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: April Abercrombie &lt;april@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Run for lives!--or not.\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, August 19, 2010, 1:42 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; For the record, I appreciate RJ&#39;s contribution here, and what he is trying\n&gt; to accomplish with these tests.
