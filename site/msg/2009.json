As expected, there&#39;s a few things I needed\n&gt;to change\n&gt; &gt; on the layout, that&#39;s what the proto type boards are for. The blue\n&gt;jumper\n&gt; &gt; wires are #30 wire-wrap wire. I could get rid of the jumpers by\n&gt;going to 4\n&gt; &gt; layer boards, but that more than doubles the cost. This is both the\n&gt;linear\n&gt; &gt; and random sweep sections shown here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; See what you&#39;re getting into���before you go there\n&gt; &gt; http://newlivehotmail.com/?\n&gt;ocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_viral_preview_0507\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;frank,\n&gt;\n&gt;the new board looks great, lets hope it works as good as the old ones.\n&gt;\n&gt;bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nIt���s the Windows Live��� Hotmail��� you love ��� on your phone! \nhttp://www.windowsmobile.com/hotmailmobile?ocid=MobileHMTagline_2"}
