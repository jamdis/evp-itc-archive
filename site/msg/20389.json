Do a google on capacitor meter. The mechanical caps usually have two sections for each band. I think one tunes the oscillator and the other the antenna. I have only gotten one conversion to work, and I just sold it. I tried two other radios this week and can&#39;t get either one to work with varactors. \n\nF-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Luis&quot; &lt;luispucp098@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  I have an important question , i  buyed a old radio .
