A lot of information in these, Frank!  In your clip "The  Government 
Announces-- We're Travelers",  I heard "Time Travel" rather than  "We're 
Travelers" - other than that, and with the exception of the  statement regarding 
Marduke's Girl, I heard everything (and clearly I might add)  as you've heard 
it.  
 
From your main clip, I also heard "The people were sick--"   I heard some 
more from the main clip but will need to listen to it  again as so many 
statements were going by so quickly (or maybe I just need  to listen faster ;)  - 
very intriguing and, I agree with you Frank,  the overall tone appears a 
tad negative.  Thanks, as always, for  sharing!
