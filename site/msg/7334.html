Because by contract PSR has to use the word demon on each episode (J/J). T=

Warren's method of removing Chip from a trance. She slapped the shit o=

Yes, the old "demon chasing" crap, once again.=20

I brought the following thought up elsewhere and will bring it up=20
here for consideration, too. If ghosts are coming through the box=20
and thus are not in a good state of mind, how come on Paranormal=20
State CM was willing to believe the message given by the ghost via=20
the box as being truth (The ghost via the box said a "demon" was=20
holding the ghosts captive there)?=20

I would suggest that perhaps a ghost (assuming we are talking about a=20
disembodied person who remains earthbound) is not in a healthy state=20
of mind one would consider "stable," but trapped in emotional trauma=20
of some sort. Thus, how reliable could the message of a ghost then=20
be? ;)
