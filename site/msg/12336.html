<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks guys, going to do a workaround for this.  I&#x27;m not happy with
having to hold down the button, or needing to reset.  I removed the
button pcb from the top half of the case tonight (including what looks
like a secondary antenna, the metal disc?), and removed the dome
contact from the up scan contact.  Going to run to radio shack
tomorrow and just solder a switch in to place on the trace contacts
(i.e. the contacts on the pcb that get connected when you press in the
dome piece).  Going to be putting everything in to its own project
setup anyways, so that&#x27;s fine.

&gt; Actually I&#x27;ve found that if I hold the tuning button down it will
&gt; continually scan (I did clip the wire before I checked to see if
that would
&gt; work without &quot;surgery&quot;)

&gt; 
&gt; I cut the mute cable on a 12-820 and had it cycle through. Every so
&gt; often, it&#x27;ll still lock on a random channel for like a second or so
&gt; and then start the sweep again. On one of the FM sweeps it actually
&gt; locked in on a &quot;not in tune&quot; channel permanently. Anyone else have
&gt; this happen?
