<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This is just a really fast generated FM sweep which is automatic and 
just goes up and down the band.  My friend has been working on these 
for me and i&#x27;m trying them out and starting to get results.  It 
really takes an aquired ear to catch it real time though, better 
success playing it back later.  I can slow the randomness down, but 
than people will just say it was a radio station.  I&#x27;m sure everyone 
knows how that goes.  I feel if it&#x27;s really fast like i&#x27;ve done it, 
it&#x27;s really not on a station long enough to get a sentence 
out...Right???

&gt; &gt; Hey Steve, I heard 50&#x27;s also. I think there may also be a 
message 
&gt; &gt; before your question but I am unable to make that part out. Is 
&gt; your 
&gt; &gt; radio manual or automatic sweep?
