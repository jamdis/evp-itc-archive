That's what I mean by first establishing that the spirit has given me trust=
worthy info consistently. If it hasn't, then the experiment stops there, at=
 least with that entity.

But this is all AFTER I have proven that I am eve=
n conversing with an entity of course.

  I would try it both ways -solo and with another person. However I w=
ould limit it to just me and one other trustworthy person.


  "How would y=
ou go about determining/verified whether it's a ghost (someone stuck in bet=
ween life and the other side), a spirit (someone that's crossed over and ca=
me back to say high) and some other type of entity?"

  Only after establis=
hing that I am indeed communicating with a spirit, and that spirit has give=
n me trustworthy info consistently, at that point I would simply ask what i=
t's nature is.

    Well, if my husband would=
 let me actually experiment with one, that would be the first step LOL!

  =
  But what I would try and do is get some kind of verifiable information fr=
om the "entity" that I contact with the board to prove that it is communica=
tion from an actual, intelligent being and not just my own motor responses =
making he planchette move. It would have to be information that I have no k=
nowledge of.

    If I could do that, and consistently, then I would be com=
fortable saying that I am actually talking to a spirit.

    The reason I h=
ave my doubts is that you have to be touching the planchette to get it to m=
ove. If it were an actual spirit, I would think that shouldn't be necessary=
. We all know ghosts can a do move objects.

    But this brings up another=
 mystery - if the Ouija board is actual spirit communication, maybe there i=
s a difference between the entities you can contact with it and your common=
 ghost.

      .


      When it comes t=
o the Ouija, I just want to study it to find out if it is really spirit com=
munication, or just kinetic energy or your subconscious mind moving the pla=
nchette.

      I agree that we all have the ability for extra sensory perc=
eption, just some are better at it than others. Like running, for instance.=
 We all can run, but some are naturally better at it. Still, with practice =
we can get better.

      But that is not my aim with the Ouija.

        You forgot yawn from boredom, that's what I do.=

        There's always the question in the=

        =
 
        Besides if you take the time to develop the ability you can get m=
