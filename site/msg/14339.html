  Yes April, I have the same belief as you.....if E=
VP's are of the personal nature, no matter if they yell into the microphone=
....if you are not the intended receiver you will NEVER hear or understand =
it. I do know my EVP's are very LOW audio. I need to work with that and AMP=
 them I guess. In some recordings (1927 is one of them) I can't hear the vo=
ice sometimes, that is how low it is. But tonight I finished my comparison =
recorder evaluations (ran 3 recorders that night) my Sony ICD B7 also heard=
 the date. The Panasonic RR-US360 could not hear it. I will upload a GET-OU=
T evp that the RR-DR60 only heard too. Was recorded same time as the asking=
 of date.As for "what kind of ears I have" :) I do have pretty good hearing=
 (but have some loss in certain areas) maybe my losses are closer to the st=
atic's level and I am helped there....I don't know yet. I have seen enough =
people (half) that I personally let hear these....they can't hear them eith=
er (some of them) so I understand why others can't hear them. Just to "loop=
" (continual repeat) of only the evp is helpful sometimes. --- In EVP-ITC@y=

  nap yeste=
rday...<WBR>.it missed a few evp's real close together (in a 5 second 
  cl=
ip) the Sony ICD-B7 heard a male use a different number than what I used. I=
 
  said 16 (my earlier age I was saying in recorder) and the male evp said=
 
  13....then a female laughs. All this was missed by the DR60 (except my =
16 was 
  recorded in both recorders) BUT then the DR60 "caught" the B7 "na=
pping" at 
  near the end of the 5 second clip....the DR60 heard "let me ou=

  (quite) males voice. So this is very promising piece of ev=

  **those 2 recordings have been uploaded to my folder. I w=

I think to grab it) 
  and my RR-QR80 to go with my RR-QR100, and one more =
(can't remember what 
  brand-model of this last---due to arrive) LOL. I ne=
ed to build a multiple

  will use my Olympus DS-50 as my "Control" rec=
order....<WBR>by using it on the 
  HQ settings. I am looking to build a "s=

  do with those low "booms" that I =
