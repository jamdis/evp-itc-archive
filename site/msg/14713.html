In a way, I agree. "Stuck" implies accidental. If a ghost is hanging around=
, it there by choice, whether it is fully aware of that or not.

you get the evidence you expect to get, so it will tend to support the conc=
ept of stuck souls. When I record it supports my concept of sprits travel, =

   I did a recording at lunch time, at home, and in it a voice says "gho=
