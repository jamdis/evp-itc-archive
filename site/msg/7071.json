This is about how to correctly and fairly moderate a \n&gt; list.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If this was the wild west, things would have transpired something \n&gt; like\n&gt; &gt; this:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bruce stood in the public street and offered a completely \nlegitimate\n&gt; &gt; exchange with the townsfolk.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Laura walked out of the saloon and took a shot at Bruce and at the\n&gt; &gt; window of Frank S&#39;s telegraph office.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bruce shot back at Laura.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Johnny Marlboro stepped out onto the balcony of the Imperial \nhotel \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; took a shot a Bruce.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bruce shot back.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Laura pulled out a deputy&#39;s badge, stuck it to her lapel, and shot\n&gt; &gt; Bruce dead.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ann ran out into the street and said, &quot;Don&#39;t you think there&#39;s a\n&gt; &gt; problem here? Maybe the sheriff needs to step in,&quot; to which Laura,\n&gt; &gt; acting under the color of law, replied that if Ann didn&#39;t like it \n&gt; she\n&gt; &gt; could leave town and if she stayed she better not question \nauthority\n&gt; &gt; again. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s what happened here.

I sit idly by and watch 200+ people get \nbad \n&gt; &gt; &gt; information on a daily basis, which hurts any good research.  \nThe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; best way to go about what we are doing is to come up with our \nown \n&gt; &gt; &gt; theories and post them as examples for others to read.  We \n&gt; shouldn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have anybody dictate every aspect of this as fact.  If anybody \n&gt; can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; give information on box use it would be Frank, who nobody who \n&gt; owns \n&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes has listened to...myself included.  He knows how they \nwork \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; offers a great amount of knowledge to this subject or else none \n&gt; of us \n&gt; &gt; &gt; would even be here.  This board has started to be a \ndictatorship \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one persons opinion and if nobody listened...they were wrong.  \n&gt; And to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; me, that&#39;s wrong.  I started out with Joe&#39;s box and moved \nforward \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; nobody helped me in my path.  I since aquired other boxes and \n&gt; taught \n&gt; &gt; &gt; myself them as well, which means it can be done.  People...do \n&gt; your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; own thing and get results the best way you can and learn from \n&gt; your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mistakes, that&#39;s what i did.  And getting Bruce his first Joe&#39;s \n&gt; box \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Frank&#39;s box and getting him started in box research, i \n&gt; somewhat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; feel responsible for what transpired on this board and i \n&gt; apologize to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; those involved.  Frank, i&#39;m sorry that another person has taken \n&gt; your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; box and claimed to know all and not listening to what you \nadhere \n&gt; we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nuff Said,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With all due respect, I am going to put my 2 bits in on \nthis.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I love the sharing of info, but have elected to post less and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; retire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to reading more. :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That said, I must agree with Ann that the initial post, \nthough \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps posted to be humorous, came off as disrespectful (in \nmy \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opinion as a reader looking in on this forum) not only to BH \n&gt; but to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; FS.
