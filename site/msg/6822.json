I&#39;ve been\ndoing evps for a few years with a fair amount of success.  One of the\nthings I have been experimenting with is using music.  I play music\nfrom the lifetimes of the spirits I&#39;m trying to communicate with to\nget the spirits intrigued enough to talk more.  I took a quick look at\nsome of the old messages here, and will definitely have to experiment\nwith some of the suggestions you all have had about using music as\nmore of a carrier wave to make it easier for them to speak through.\n\nWhat drew me to this group, though, is that I just made a Radio Shack\nhack a couple of days ago and have been completely stunned by the\nresults.  I&#39;m getting more communications through it in 15 minutes\nthan I would usually get in evps over hours.  I am absolutely blown\naway.  Even more interesting is that a spirit in my house who I&#39;ve\nnever been able to get evps from is quite the chatterbox through the\nhack.  I have a couple of my first files in the folder Nellie&#39;s Files\nthat I found particularly interesting.\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Nellie%27s%20Files/\n\nAnyway, I am looking forward to learning from/with you all.\n\nNellie Kampmann"}
