Hi=
...this is Michelle, Andy's partner. I dont always participate in conversat=
ions here, mainly due to time constraints, but since my name got pulled int=
o the discussion...thought I'd weigh in! :)



I'm glad April's discussion =
went well. We have enjoyed working with her and getting to know her. 



Th=
ank you Adrienne for your support on the sea lion case. It has been an amaz=
ing and beautiful experience.



Just want to clarify a fact about the mone=
y that goes into our research. Everything we do is funded 100% by us alone.=
 We take no money from events, ticket sales, sales of any kind, money from =
any outside sources. When we do speaking engagements we waive fees or ask t=
hat it is donated to charity. We have no need for it and are concerned only=
 with learning, finding answers to big questions, furthering everyone's abi=
lity to learn & understand...and hope that along the way some of the answer=
s we are finding can be keys that unlock new doors and are missing pieces o=
f puzzles we can all use to change or fix things that need it & further our=
 understanding of our universe. 



If you see us at an event-its because w=
e want to share something new we've learned and be available publically to =
answer questions in person. Most of what we are doing right now, in this ea=
rly stage, requires one on one, face to face conversations I believe. And w=
e really enjoy the challenge of interactive question & answer communication=
 about our work.



April is one of the paranormal investigators and ITC re=
searchers we have testing equipment for us, and yes there are others, as we=
ll as scientists in other labs in controlled settings as we are collecting =
data to publish results. 



The device we are focusing on right now outsid=
e of the ITC probe is one that Andy developed based on probe results which =
derived from a paranormal investigation involving an autistic child that wa=
s noncommunicative. What happened that night gave him an idea about how to =
reach other autustic children like this one. Its basically the probe revers=
e engineered. It has been approved for and currently in an official "trial"=
 being used by select schools where teachers & families are using it with f=
antastic success to communicate ...and is based on electromagnetic signals.=




On a side note.....that device is unexpectedly working for us in the fi=
eld in paranormal experiments, in much the same way that the ITC probe is, =
we now know. We've been taking it out over the last few weeks and excited t=
hat its allowing people to hear and converse in much the same way as the pr=
obe....only I believe much easier and much more clearly.



These devices a=
re in the very, very early stages of development and we havent thrown a gre=
at deal of information or recordings out there yet since we are still in ga=
thering data mode, trying to answer some specific questions of our own and =
hoping to publish what we've discovered in as responsible a way as possible=
. 



We are gathering a pretty strong support group in the scientific comm=
unity, which is tough given the subject matter, but the results some guys a=
re seeing and experiencing themselves is creating quite a wave rumbling thr=
ough the community. The people backing us up and supporting us are a really=
 cool preview of what is to come and we are stoked. There will always be a =
few outraged chest beaters who wont like what is happening, but it will be =
very difficult for them to argue with the math and the data.



We both hav=
e one foot firmly planted in the science world and one foot in the paranorm=
al world. Im intrigued to see how this plays out in conversations once we p=
ublish and go public. Should be awesome....could get ugly. lol One other co=
ol sign we got a few weeks ago was a serious request to hold a paranormal p=
hysics lecture at MIT. It will be an interesting litmus test. 



Anyway...=
.there are a few places you can go to see our work and see a few examples o=
f what we are doing. www.iboldlygo.com and www.youtube.com/diver4skynsea.

=


You can email us directly if you have questions too. We get a lot of mess=
ages and cant always be incredibly prompt because of that...but do our best=
. Andy@... or discover@.... 



And if you live in californ=
ia or are visiting and want to meet up to talk or see what we do let us kno=
w.



Take care,
