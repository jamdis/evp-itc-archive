RJ, I did not ask spirit for evidence, they have nothing to prove to me,  
=
because it is as i said before, this is subject to the listener for the mos=
t  
part.  They are real people over there just like here, and for this typ=
e of 
 communication to be coming out now was a part of God's plan.  Except=
 it  
not.  The Wright Brother's were laughed at too, people thought flying=

nuts!  Yet here we are today flying all over the place, lol everythi=
