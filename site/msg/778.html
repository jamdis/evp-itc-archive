<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I kept getting this nmessage for years, thinking it was the echo box they 
wanted open. I tried that a few times, and it made no difference. It turns 
out that if I leave the front panel of the receiver open, the feedback 
between the echo box mic, and the monitor speaker is almost eliminated. On 
one of the mini boxes I drilled 3/8 holes in the cover to cut out feedback, 
in a recent system I raised the front panel on 1/2&quot; stand offs and that 
works. So I do get some guidence from the &quot;guys&quot;, I just don&#x27;t understand 
it.......most of the time!! Curiously, when I first got that message I heard 
&quot;Frank has a girl friend&quot;, which was false, then it seemingly changed to 
&quot;leave the box open&quot; both having the same amount of syllables. That was back 
in 2003. It really makes one question one&#x27;s hearing!
