So, i have used it in your \nfashion up to this point.  I have also noticed that the Spirits on FM \nare very mean and curse a lot and AM does not.  Can you explain that \none ???   Technicians if offered to a box user i feel should only be \nused to get the communication up and running and than only call on \nthem when you are having problems....hence &quot;Technician&quot;----People who \nfix things.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;purplespacefriend&quot; \n&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  I have noticed a disturbing trend of box users to develop what \n&gt; appears to be an ego based &quot;mission&quot; that seems to coincide with \n&gt; these supposed technicains. You would think, since I make the boxes \nI \n&gt; would get some assistence from the supopsoed technicains, but there \n&gt; is none! \n&gt; \n&gt;  I do not know who or what communicates. I am unwilling to jump on \n&gt; the higher spirit band wagon, as they seemly produce nothing \nuseful, \n&gt; very little verifiable information, nothing that makes life better, \n&gt; nothing that helps me make better boxes. I know only that something \n&gt; talks that shouldn&#39;t be there, and that keeps me intrigued. As Sun \n&gt; Bear used to say, &quot;They don&#39;t grow any corn&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I have a &quot;group&quot; that insists I am their Space Princess, now how \n&gt; wise is it to just accept what they say, without question, being \nthat \n&gt; I am niether female, nor Royalty!\n&gt; \n&gt;  Curious that I make the boxes, but my input about it&#39;s use is so \n&gt; easily dismissed.\n&gt; \n&gt;  There is at the very least, multiple levels that can be contacted, \n&gt; some very manipulative, perhaps demonic if you want to go down that \n&gt; road. If you want them to tell you how great you are, they will \n&gt; certainly do so, that is why the caution. \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robin Searcy Henson&quot; \n&gt; &lt;MudPuddleFarm@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Frank, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When you mention being distrustful of what comes through the \nboxes, \n&gt; are you saying you&#39;re skeptical of the &quot;technicians&quot; being who they \n&gt; say they are?  Not trying to open another can of worms here, just \n&gt; wanting to continue learning from your experience and research.  I \n&gt; get what you&#39;re saying about becoming obsessive with the sessions.  \n&gt; I&#39;ve probably asked you this a half dozen times over the last \ncouple \n&gt; of years, but who or what do YOU think you&#39;re/we&#39;re  communicating \n&gt; with?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Robin\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;   From: purplespacefriend&lt;mailto:purplealiengirl@&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Saturday, February 02, 2008 7:46 PM\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: File from tonight\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Have ya tried EVPmaker? It is based on that random principle, \nand \n&gt; &gt;   predates the boxes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   I&#39;ve heard this stuff before, about random being the best, and \nI \n&gt; &gt;   have to disaggree. I also think it unwise to spend every waking \n&gt; &gt;   moment doing sessions. I think it creates that expectation, and \n&gt; &gt;   perhaps desperation to make contact, and I would tend not to \n&gt; trust \n&gt; &gt;   what comes through. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   I don&#39;t trust some of this stuff because I have yet get any \n&gt; &gt;   meaningful assistence with the boxes from the so called \n&gt; technicians. \n&gt; &gt;   All I ever got was a telepathic &quot;suggestion&quot; to use the echo \n&gt; boxes. \n&gt; &gt;   Everything else was a assemblage of stuff I had worked on in \nhte \n&gt; past \n&gt; &gt;   to solve the problem of &quot;what else could I use&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   I hate to see yet another go down the road of &quot;this is the \n&gt; onlyest \n&gt; &gt;   way&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Frank-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
