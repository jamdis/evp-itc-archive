You&#39;d think they would gravitate somewhere more meaningful  \n&gt; than where their body was deposited, wouldn&#39;t you?  I haven&#39;t had  \n&gt; much luck picking up graveyard EVP personally, but I do have one  \n&gt; cool one.  I was standing at the door of a mausoleum where a former  \n&gt; governor and his wife are entombed, and I called the wife&#39;s name  \n&gt; out loud while recording.

Weird one.\n&gt;\n&gt; They might. From what I have heard of other people&#39;s cemetery EVPs,  \n&gt; it sounds like a lot of cemeteries are populated with people who  \n&gt; haven&#39;t made it over. I find cemetery EVP to be the most  \n&gt; fascinating because they seem to offer a glimpse into a chaotic and  \n&gt; not-so-pretty part of the After Life that very few are willing to  \n&gt; look at. Our cemeteries seem to me to truly be cities of the dead.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann\n&gt;\n&gt; On Jan 28, 2008, at 4:07 AM, Robin Searcy Henson wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I hear it all!
