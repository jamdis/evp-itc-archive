Ok Laura, here's =
one more using the same method. The capture requires some explanation to un=
derstand the relevance and the amount of info that can be derived from just=
 a few words. The capture as I hear it sounds like a male with a high voice=
. I hear the words as "Five X is your breaker". I will decode this message =
for you. First of all this method involves the use of a CB walkie talkie. T=
he term "breaker" was a code word of a polite way of =E2=80=98breaking in=
=E2=80=99 on a conversation in progress. The person indicating this was kno=
wn as a =E2=80=98breaker=E2=80=99. Then the message further identifies hims=
elf as "Five X", this would be a code name or tester name. This would also =
mean this Spirit is relating to the use of the CB radio and or carrier used=
 in the method. A lot of info from just five words (5 X and the use of five=
 words, another coincidence?, I think not). 
"Five X is your breaker"

seanjankowski1 , thanks for the detail I requested and best of l=
uck with your project. Through much trial and error I have determined that =
the use of germanium transistors can be helpful as far as clarity of EVP vo=
ices. There is a four page thread over on AA-EVP forum where I outlined my =
experiments with a four (germanium) transistor tape recorder (DC bias) and =
a germanium transistor walkie talkie. The walkie talkie is used mainly as t=
he microphone pre-amp for the tape recorder. The equipment vintage is 1963.=
 This is one of the captures. 
"David you found the voice" 
Thanks 
Dave

Spelling corrections, information corrections... Thanks for the ed=
it 
and for the information. I'll make sure before I post again that I 
hav=
e all the information straight. Not here to argue or anything as a 
matter =
of fact I want to thank you for giving me the facts as they 
should be. It'=
s been a while since I actually read anything from WITC. 

As I said, I was=
 searching out ways to bring all the devices and their 
uses into one unit.=
 It might help prove that the phenomena is real if 
I could get multiple co=
nfirmations on one unit. Of course you can 
always just use many units at o=
nce and get the same effect. 

Thanks for the info.

<br>
seanjankowski1 , thanks for th=
e detail I requested and best of luck with your
project. Through much trial=
 and error I have determined that the use of
germanium transistors can be h=
elpful as far as clarity of EVP voices. There is
a four page thread over on=
 AA-EVP forum where I outlined my experiments with a
four (germanium) trans=
istor tape recorder (DC bias) and a germanium transistor
walkie talkie. The=
 walkie talkie is used mainly as the microphone pre-amp for
the tape record=
er. The equipment vintage is 1963. This is one of the captures. <br>
"=
David you found the voice" <br>
Thanks <br>
Dave <br>

Subject: [EVP-ITC] The Myth of Using=
 Germanium Diodes (was Re: All In One
Device) <br>

Spelling corrections, information corrections... Th=
anks for the edit <br>
and for the information. I'll make sure before I pos=
t again that I <br>
have all the information straight. Not here to argue or=
 anything as a <br>
matter of fact I want to thank you for giving me the fa=
cts as they <br>
should be. It's been a while since I actually read anythin=
g from WITC. <br>
<br>
As I said, I was searching out ways to bring all the=
 devices and their <br>
uses into one unit. It might help prove that the ph=
enomena is real if <br>
I could get multiple confirmations on one unit. Of =
course you can <br>
always just use many units at once and get the same eff=
ect. <br>
<br>
Thanks for the info. <br>
