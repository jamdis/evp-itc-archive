<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have posted some new EVP maker allophone files from the latest 
session.

The basic topic was where the entities communicating are from and if 
they are human spirits.

Just like any of the box research, the answers are vague and cryptic.
And open for wide interpritation.

Files 7 and 9 wher so long that yahoo would not accept the filename.
