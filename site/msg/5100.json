Saving  \nlistening to the sound bytes after I get some work done this morning.\n\nI spent my travel time reading the first Sara Estep book. Until I  \njoined this group I hadn&#39;t heard about her, but reading her book has  \nmade me even more determined to start research with a vengeance.\n\nI was in St Augustine, investigating at the St A Lighthouse. While I  \nwas there I stopped at a couple of Radio Shacks to see if they had the  \nolder 469, and found out that I wasn&#39;t the only one searching there.  \nOther people who were in town for the Lighthouse investigation were  \nhitting local RS stores too -- had to laugh! I did manage to bid on  \nthe on that was on eBay, but due to the auction cutoff time and my  \nflights I missed the sale by $1.00. I was so close! Oh well, there  \nwill be other ways to get to where I&#39;m going.\n\nFrank, I did get the screws from my camera in the mail while I was  \ngone -- thanks! I&#39;m going to mail the camera off this week to Zack to  \nsee if he can help.\n\nI&#39;m looking forward to hearing the samples that everyone loaded while  \nI was gone ~\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nDebbie Tejada\n\n&quot;Once you can accept the universe as matter expanding into nothing  \nthat is something, wearing stripes with plaid comes easy. &quot;  ~Albert  \nEinstein"}
