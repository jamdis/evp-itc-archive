Unfortunately this one functions by dialing in the channel you want so it isn&#39;t functioning in a way that can be used with a scanning EVP setup.  I think a non dialer is available with the same company and that is what I ordered but I need to go back in a check.  Another $60 down.  I hope to use it to get Coast to Coast from San Antonio so it isn&#39;t all lost.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Jeremy   I listened to your posts and you got some great captures there.  I am encouraged because Mike is sending me a RS 125 for me to pick up in San Diego next month.  Sounds a lot better than my 469.

Somehow you are supposed to be able to boost your signal\n&gt; without any external device such as a Select-A-Tenna. I need to read\n&gt; into it further.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am very seriously considering buying a Select-A-Tenna.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeremy\n&gt;"}
