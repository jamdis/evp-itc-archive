&gt; Playing acrh skeptic, what value is a voice for survival evidence if you
&gt; don&#x27;t know who it is? How do you know where it came from? Or can say beyond
&gt; doubt that it&#x27;s even &quot;paranormal&quot;? People have millions of these voices by
&gt; now.

&gt; &gt; I have been experimenting with EVP for about a year now (in my home) and i
&gt; &gt; have captured some brilliant evidence for survival.The first voice i
&gt; &gt; captured was that of a little boy saying &#x27;&#x27;hello&#x27;&#x27;at 1.30 am.It was so clear
&gt; &gt; that others could agree on and the voice could be still heard some fifteen
&gt; &gt; feet away from the recorder.I have captured other voices too, just as
&gt; &gt; impressive.Unfortunately i can&#x27;t upload because my recorder is a micro
&gt; &gt; cassette type.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt;Well,on a few occasions the voices have interacted with me, suggesting a real intelligent force..I know it sounds crazy,but it&#x27;s true..It blew my mind i can tell you!For me there can only be one source,and that is from spirit..as far as i&#x27;m aware there is no compelling reason not to believe in the afterlife?</pre>
