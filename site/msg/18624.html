<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Everytime I&#x27;m about to drop all public interaction cuz of the idiot
skeptics that accept nothing, I get this kind of voice. As I switch to TRF a
voice says &quot;People do listen&quot;.

 Try to answer these skeptics and all they can do is accuse me of attacking
them, while they accept no evidence, no one else&#x27;s results, and break out
all smug and arrogant.  Nothing paranormal eh!? Well explain just how
something would know when I was going to switch and make a meaningful
comment at that instant.  Actually don&#x27;t bother explaining, I don&#x27;t wanna
hear your crap science answer.  Most thinking people here can see/hear there
is something to the paranormal and it is not imagination.

 This is what I call the &quot;History Box&quot; as I tried to incorporate all
functions I&#x27;ve been using into one unit. It almost works, been working on it
since last December. Arm Band tuner, TRF tuner, and car tuner, random and
linear sweep, random still needs work.
