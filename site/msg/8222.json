As you can see from my \naddy, my name is Pat and from CT (and sometimes Maine) ...\n\nMy youngest son committed suicide 10 yrs ago.  He was one of many \nyoung men in my family to pass on young (he was 24, I was 43) and our \nbirthdays were only a week apart.  His birthday would have been \nEaster Sunday.\n\nI was introduced to Frank&#39;s Box via Paranormal State and it spiked my \ninterest.  I do have an avid interest with the paranormal, howevere, \nI do believe that if I ever had anything happen to me personally, I \nwould probably panic.\n\nI am interested in the price of someone making a box for me, and, of \ncourse, instructions on how to do this and stay safe.  Like many \nothers, my interest is contact with family members who have passed \non, most especially, my son Brian.  He was a believer in these things \ntoo.  Unfortunately, he was diagnosed with a mental illness, and \ninstead of giving meds a try, he felt his life would never \nbe &quot;normal&quot; again, and chose to go back home to God and his \nbeloved &quot;Gramps&quot;.  I cry just thinking of all this, as my father was \nmost Beloved to me too.\n\nIf any of you are able to ask the question if Brian or Tom (grandson \nand grandfather) are present, and if they can get any messages to me, \nI would appreciate it.  The tears are streaming down my eyes just \nthinking of all this, as I lost Brian and my Dad within about 18 mos \nof each other.\n\nHave to run, I hear my sis coming home.  Thanks for any help any of \nyou could offer.\nPat"}
