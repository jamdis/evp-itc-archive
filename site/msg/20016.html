Don't know how you guy's feel, but I still marvel at all of  this, I went 
to turn off the box tonight, and I just said, "God Bless" to them,  and I got 
back a man's voice clearly repeating back to me, "God Bless"  in  a soft 
smooth tone, yet so clear it was as if he were in the same room as  I.   It 
still shakes me, these people are dead folks, they are dead,  dead people, 
that seem very much still alive some where, and isn't it  wonderful to know 
that we do live on too?  I still cannot get over how  amazing, this 
communication. it is like having a great dream become  alive!  sf
