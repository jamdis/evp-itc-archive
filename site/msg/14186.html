Yes you can tell loss of quality by a bit-level comparison.=A0 An audio fil=
e is just a file of bytes, that is later interpreted by an audio player.=A0=
 Two files with the exact same contents, whether they are audio or image or=
 a dababase or an exe, are indistinguishable from each other.=A0 That is, i=
f I copied the contents of one to a new file, and the contents of the other=
 to a new file, and asked you which file each came from, there would be no =
way to tell.=A0 Even the audio player could not tell.=A0 The data is identi=
cal, and so the sound (or the picture, etc) would be identical.

Yes I did =
listen to the results, but that is not the best test (they sounded identica=

It is probably possible to set up an email compression scheme that does do =
lossy audio compression.=A0 My tests show my setup does not.=A0 If you'd li=

          For executables, you may be right. 
          However, for wav fi=

          =
=A0
          I used to think as you do, in that 
          the emailed att=
achment=A0of a wav file would not loose anything. 
          After a length=
y discourse with another member here, I learned that I 
          was wrong=
. The reason why=A0I did not realize it in the first place 
          is th=
at when I would email a wav file, I would intentionally keep it 
          =
in very small segments, to keep file size down. This was just for ease 
   =
       of transfer. But because of this, I had not experienced any noticeab=

          loss.
          =A0
          Now it may be in some cases, 
 =
         depending on the servers or what have you that the file goes throu=
gh, 
          that the loss may be less or more. But once the attachment i=

          the original wav.

  The kind of compression that occurs during an 
                  email at=
tachment is "lossless": it compress the file cleverly 
                  wi=
thout losing information.=A0 For example, if I had a 
                  pro=
gram in some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it could 
              =
    compress it.=A0 But if it lost even one bit, the resulting 
           =
       exe file would not execute again after it was uncompressed on 
     =
             the other side.

This kind of compression does things 
       =
           like looking for common patterns in the file, and replacing 
   =
               them with a token.=A0 A rough example would be if it found 
=
                  "Howdy Neighbor" in a file 20 times, it could replace all=
 the 
                  occurances with say $HN1.=A0 And also write a littl=
e 
                  dictionary in there someplace that says "$HN1=3DHowdy =

                  Neighbor".

When the file gets to its destination it can=
 
                  be uncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are replace=
d with 
                  "Howdy Neighbor".=A0 So it was compressed (instea=
d of 14 
                  characters each, it only needed 4, plus the dict=
ionary), but 
                  lost no data.

Some formats, like jpeg and =
mp3. are not 
                  lossless.=A0 Depending on the level of comp=
ression, some 
                  level of data is lost, and so cannot be re=
covered or 
                  reconstructed later.

nterpreted by an audio player.  Two files with the exact same contents=
, whether they are audio or image or a dababase or an exe, are indistinguis=
hable from each other.  That is, if I copied the contents of one to a =
new file, and the contents of the other to a new file, and asked you which =
file each came from, there would be no way to tell.  Even the audio pl=
ayer could not tell.  The data is identical, and so the sound (or the =
picture, etc) would be identical.<br><br>Yes I did listen to the results, b=
ut that is not the best test (they sounded identical, but that is a subject=
ive opinion).  The real test is compring the contents.  Identical=
 contents means indentical data, means identical audio.<br><br>It is probab=
ly
 possible to set up an email compression scheme that does do lossy audio=
 compression.  My tests show my setup does not.  If you'd like me=
 to help test your setup, we can do that too. From what I see, lossy compre=

    the emailed attachment of a wav file would not loose anything. 
  =
        After a lengthy discourse with another member here, I learned that =
I 
          was wrong. The reason why I did not realize it in the fir=
st place 
          is that when I would email a wav file, I would intentio=
nally keep it 
          in very small segments, to keep file size down. Th=
is was just for ease 
          of transfer. But because of this, I had not=
 experienced any noticeable 
          loss.</font></div>

       =
   that the loss may be less or more. But once the attachment is 
         =
 downloaded, the quality has been found to be less then

          =
        email attachment is "lossless": it compress the file cleverly 
    =
              without losing information.  For example, if I had a 
  =
                program in some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it co=
uld 
                  compress it.  But if it lost even one bit, the =
resulting 
                  exe file would not execute again after it was =
uncompressed on 
                  the other side.<br><br>This kind of comp=
ression does things 
                  like looking for common patterns in =
the file, and replacing 
                  them with a token.  A rough=
 example would be if it found 
                  "Howdy Neighbor" in a file=
 20 times, it could replace all the 
                  occurances with say =
$HN1.  And also write a little 
                  dictionary in there =
someplace that says "$HN1=3DHowdy 
                  Neighbor".<br><br>When=
 the file gets to its destination it can 
                  be uncompressed=
, and all occurences of $HN1 are replaced with 
                  "Howdy Ne=
ighbor".  So it was compressed (instead of 14 
                  chara=
cters each, it only needed 4, plus the dictionary), but 
                  =
lost no data.<br><br>Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not 
            =
      lossless.  Depending on the level of compression, some 
        =
          level of data is lost, and so cannot be recovered or
