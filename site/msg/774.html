<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m not sure about the breakthrough, but there are several systems and 
mehtods that work. I think maybe the big break through will be people 
realizing that this communication is possible.  Yeah, it&#x27;s kinda srange how 
there&#x27;s a whole gourp about our age that is active in ITC.

&gt;Frank!
&gt;I went to that url you listed here and I saw where you posted. Here I was, 
&gt;thinking that you were OLD, but to my surprise, you and I are the same age! 
&gt;Well, at least for the moment. I was born May 9th, 1953. So you may 
&gt;actually be older or younger, but we&#x27;re both 53 right now! I find this 
&gt;amusing! I should have known! LOL Learn something new everyday! Ain&#x27;t that 
&gt;the truth!
&gt;That site I went to, about Montague Keen, was very interesting! I joined 
&gt;also! It&#x27;s all very impressive! What do you think the big &quot;breakthrough&quot; in 
&gt;spirit communication is going to be?
&gt;Thanks for the info,
&gt;Candi

&gt;
&gt;   Yeah, there are examples on the sites I went to, not remembering now 
&gt;which
&gt;   thery were, and the favorites that I marked are at work. I have had 
&gt;voices
&gt;   like that too, using the crowd noise from one of our school board 
&gt;meetings.
&gt;   There was some ghopst voices mixed in. These entities will speak with 
&gt;almost
&gt;   anything if they know someone is/will be listening.
&gt;
&gt;   http://www.itcbridge.com/forum/ Here&#x27;s a very interesting forum for 
&gt;EVP/ITC.
