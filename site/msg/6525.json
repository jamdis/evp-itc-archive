Anyway, the commercial was balleyhooing something about getting the best reception in the world on at least these five stations.   Then again, maybe I dreamed it.  But I do think it aired on coast 2 coast and probably is on that station alot.  I don&#39;t get C2C here on a regular basis.  Sooo, my question is, does anyone know about a special radio system...maybe it is satellite generated...and, how would that fit with our work.
