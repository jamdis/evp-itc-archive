I understand now why Frank gets so frustrated at times, especially when people tell him (or Steve or anyone, really!) what their files &quot;really&quot; say. \n&gt;   \n&gt;  Further, I don&#39;t think people here share their files so that others can (mis) &quot;interpret&quot; their recordings for them! \n&gt;   \n&gt;  I&#39;ve seen this happen over and over and over again (usually by the same people) and personally I feel that it&#39;s incredibly rude, condescending and totally obnoxious. \n&gt;   \n&gt;  My two cents, \n&gt;  J\n&gt;   \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Mon, 12/27/10, Urkel23 urkel23@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; From: Urkel23 urkel23@...\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Monday, December 27, 2010, 11:28 PM\n&gt; \n&gt;      \n&gt; Thank you for correcting me, hopefully one day i will have a better ear to hear the communication like you do. \n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe Frank and I should give up.
