I&#39;m really looking forward to learning more about this approach to capturing EVPs.  \n\nMy visit here started with a discussion over at the American Ghost Society investigators&#39; group with a question about the Ovilus (sp?), which I hadn&#39;t heard of before.  A Yahoo search later and following assorted links, and here I am.\n\nI learned about the Frank&#39;s box last year at the AGS conference when Rosemary Ellen Guiley did a presentation about it.  I have the Radio Shack hack as described in Strange Frequencies.  My team has used it on a few occasions, including one where we feel we were getting valid responses through it.  We&#39;ve still got a lot more experimenting to do.\n\nOne of the things that Rosemary emphasized was that repeated use of a Frank&#39;s box in the same location can result in drawing in shadow people.  Frank, you have indicated that you use yours at home.  Does that mean that this hasn&#39;t been your experience?\n\nBy the way, I don&#39;t know how you feel about being a celebrity in our little universe, but it is a pleasure to meet you.\n\nHypnobarb"}
