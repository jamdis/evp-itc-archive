Maybe this will help somewhat...\n&gt; 1. Speakjet chip and suitable audio amp.\n&gt; 2. PIC microcontroller, configured to talk to Speakjet serial port \nat \n&gt; 9600 baud, including baud sync and flow control feedback from SJ.\n&gt; 3. An array of &quot;speak&quot; (ascii)commands programmed into PIC to \ninitiate \n&gt; outputting of all specific allophones, as per the Speakjet \ndatasheet.\n&gt; 4. External sensor of some form (perhaps EMF) that is able to act \nas \n&gt; environmental trigger for allophone speaking.\n&gt; 5.PIC sub-routine to allow PIC to read and digitize the sensor \nanalog \n&gt; output via the PIC&#39;s A/D input(s).\n&gt; 6 PIC sub-routine to link incoming sensor data to the selection of \n&gt; allophone output, depending on sensor level thresholds, etc and \nperhaps \n&gt; a random selection process.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a Yahoo group dedicated to the Speakjet chip, but it wont \nbe \n&gt; of much help in this case. The core work is in the PIC programming.\n&gt; \n&gt; Think thats about it for now. Hope this helps.\n&gt; regards from &quot;down under&quot;,\n&gt; JEFF\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, &quot;Chad&quot; &lt;cawiggins78@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyone have plans for a speakerjet box they&#39;re willing to share?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
