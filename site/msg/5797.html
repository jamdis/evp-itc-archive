How fascinating.  I'd like to be involved with this project.

  Subject: [EVP-ITC] New Subje=
ct For Research Sessions


  Hi Everyone,

  I have been thinking about wha=
t our friends on the other side have 
  been saying concerning harmony, res=
onance and positive vibration.
  While thinking on this and how to achieve =
amongst us all, I had an 
  idea for a new subject of research. I had been =
thinking about 
  spiritual and harmonic energy connection between the spir=
it world and 
  our physical world and contemplating how Mike & Lisa stress=
 the 
  importance of this state in the success of better stronger 
  commu=
nication.

  Then the idea of identical twins came to mind and the spiritua=
l and 
  sometimes telekinetic bonds that they have been known to share. Th=
is 
  idea raised two questions in my mind. 

  1. is this spiritual and me=
ntal energy bond between twins similar to 
  the bond we must develop with =
our spirit counter parts to facilitate 
  better, stronger and longer susta=
ined communication. 

  2. twins in the womb are conceived when for whateve=
r reason one 
  single egg splits into two separate eggs and those two fetu=
ses 
  develop independently of each other, but with identical DNA blue 
  =
prints and identical physical characteristics. The question is.

  Is their=
 spirit or spiritual energy also divided equally between the 
  two individ=
uals that is existent as one spirit divided into two that 
  serves as thei=
r individual spiritual energy while in the physical and 
  then after death=
 is recombined into a single spirit?

  Or does the spirit at the time of f=
etal division become two separate 
  and distinct spirits that remain as tw=
o individual spirits after 
  crossing to the spirit world?

  I propose a =
research experiment involving certain questions to our 
  technicians invol=
ving this subject matter over say the course of 
  three 10 minute sessions=
. At the end all participants will submit 
  their individual responses if =
any and they can be compared for 
  similarity or dissimilarity.

  Any res=
earchers interested in this project please let me know, I 
  would like to =
get started within the week.

  Bruce
