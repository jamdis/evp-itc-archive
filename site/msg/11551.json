Awhile ago the bathroom which can be seen from the main \nbedroom was all blue and I thought the tv was left on, but what looked \nlike an old woman came out stopped in the hallway turned and looked at \nme then started to break apart like blowing sand. Strange.\n\nStephen ..\n\n\nAndrea Carr wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am Andrea Carr who is a 41 year old wife and mom of 1 daughter. I am \n&gt; sorry I have not written before but I have a terrible year and haven&#39;t \n&gt; had the time to concentrate on EVP like I had prior. I won&#39;t get into \n&gt; the details but it has left me in the midst of OK just trying to pull \n&gt; through all of this BS & I will get back to it when I can.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Unfortunatley I am leaving for the weekend tomorrow morning and won&#39;t \n&gt; see my e-mails until Monday morning.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have a question for any one here. I believe in aliens, spirit and \n&gt; ghost communications via evp but tonight I had an experience I never \n&gt; had before.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I woke up at exactly 2:22 by my stove&#39;s clock and went and cleaned my \n&gt; sink of dishes while I heated up some cream chipped beef (albiet not \n&gt; too exciting) but while I sat there after in the dark with my family \n&gt; sleeping my hallway ilummating a light clored blue several times. \n&gt; Anyone else ever seen this?\n&gt;  \n&gt; I look forward to any responses.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Andrea\n&gt; \n&gt; No virus found in this incoming message.\n&gt; Checked by AVG - http://www.avg.com \n&gt; Version: 8.0.138 / Virus Database: 270.5.2/1561 - Release Date: 7/18/2008 6:35 PM\n&gt;   \n\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.\nChecked by AVG - http://www.avg.com \nVersion: 8.0.138 / Virus Database: 270.5.2/1561 - Release Date: 7/18/2008 6:35 PM"}
