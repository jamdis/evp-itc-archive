Hi Frank,
 
I have gotten "gatekeeper" come over in my sessions before.  Now I  
understand what is meant by it.

I  don't mind telling you. I know this through a combination of trusted  
researchers messages that have been confirmed by my own messages. This  viewpoint 
is also shared by many of the "pioneers" and their miraculous  contacts of the 
80's and 90's. The words such as tech, gatekeeper,  facilitator, or whatever 
may change but the function remains the same. Don't  get caught up in the 
semantics. LOL

If you are looking for proof, ask  your heart what is real. 

Regards,

Frank R.

Hey, thanks Frank R, I'm glad I asked.  Now I want to ask how you know  all 
this, but I'm not going to.  I will work a bit to digest what you  just told 
me.  Cheers   Ron L

Sure,  I was just being considerate. Didn't want to butt in... he he A bridge 
or  contact bridge is a link between you and other entities. Not just spirits 
 who have transitioned but also living entities. You can form a bridge with  
the help of other researchers and colleagues on the other side of the veil.  
This is the link you communicate over! A contact field is the field each of  us 
generate to make that link. It is controlled by our desire to make  contact. 
Both concepts will grow in strength and weaken depending on the  resonance or 
harmony you share with others in the bridge.

The  technicians or techs that Bruce and others like to call them are  
facilitators or gatekeepers. They control the window or gate when contact is  made 
or the bridge is activated. A lot of the time you may not even know who  they 
are. My primary guide and gatekeeper does not want to be identified,  which is 
apparent in the message I received when I asked: "It is not  important, just 
know that I love you very much". That is the answer I got  when I asked who my 
primary facilitator was.

I say primary because  there seems to be more than one who will operate the 
"gate". I catch chatter  all the time asking who is on the gate or who is 
operating the gate and so  on. Some are more forceful and controlling than others 
and some are more  liberal on who they let through. Just know it is okay to ask 
them to limit  who is let through, how you would like them to speak (clearly 
and one at a  time) or how you want to be addressed.

Regards,

Frank  R.

you can take a moment to explain.  LOL Ron L

Any idea what "the bridge" signifies in this message?  I have a  connection 
to that term.
