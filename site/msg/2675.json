There where times when, for example, when a late  \nmember of another group showed me pictures where he was absolutely  \nsure they showed something paranormal and all I saw was zip-- \nsometimes not even enough to blame it on pattern recognition. We&#39;d  \nargue until the old saw was trotted out, &quot;You skeptics don&#39;t believe  \nanything.&quot; I&#39;d always assure him that I did, in fact, accept the  \nreality of EVP, life after death, UFOs, time travel, and any number  \nof other paranormal issues, and just because I did not perceive one  \npiece of potential evidence was actually evidence, it was very unfair  \nto tar and feather me.\n\nThere have been times when I heard a clear EVP and no one else did  \nand times that others insisted they clearly heard one and I did not.  \n(And I have to add that sometimes listening for EVPs amidst a long  \nstream of bandwidth tuning diminishes them for me--it makes them  \nsound much more likely to be broadcast fragments. Unless you have  \ngood headphones and are listening very carefully to each syllable, it  \nsounds like junk.)\n\nAlso, please keep in mind that when you solicit a stranger&#39;s opinion,  \nyou need to accept the fact that you may not get the validation you  \nare looking for. I get hundreds of supposed paranormal pics sent to  \nme each year. 99.9 are camera artifacts. I only write back to the  \nones I think may be possibly paranormal because if I write back and  \nsay it is a camera artifact, then I end up in a slanging match with  \nthe person who sent it and I assure you that every conversation  \nincludes the sentence &quot;Well, you skeptics don&#39;t believe anything!&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t know this person that all the slanging is going on about  \nhere, but I do know that he, like me, simply may not hear it, may not  \nwant to be involved for whatever reason, or may just be in a bad mood  \nthat someone is demanding he agree with them when he honestly  \ndoesn&#39;t. There is nothing wrong with that. It doesn&#39;t make him the  \ntwin brother of James Randi or even a simple skeptic.\n\nHave some mercy on people who don&#39;t see with you eye to eye. Agree to  \ndisagree. Be good to each other, for chrissakes. This is not an all- \nor-nothing issue. And I think that once you come to the conclusion  \nthat you have experienced enough high strangeness to know, without a  \ndoubt, that the basic fact that the Other Side and far more exists,  \nthen the need for every possible piece of evidence to be real fades  \naway. We&#39;re not looking for evidence. We have it already. We&#39;re  \nlooking for the best evidence possible.\n\n/rant\n\nAnn\n\n\nOn Oct 26, 2007, at 10:07 AM, Zack Widup wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; He&#39;s not a debunker.
