I've noticed that even skeptics start picking up on things psychically 
after they've been doing investigations for awhile (not that they'd 
admit it!).

It is handy when doing EVP/ITC work.  Again, I've noticed that when the 
signal isn't coming through clearly enough that the average 
non-researcher could make sense of it, researchers' psychic abilities 
tend to kick in and fill in the blanks to get the message.
