<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks Kristin, of all the EVP&#x27;s that I have gathered these past 3 months, this one was the ONLY one that I might have figured that I was &quot;wishing&quot; to hear a sound that might now hae been there :) I hope to meet up with the little guy again someday :) I bottle fed the little rascle as an abandoned stray (and his sibling) the sibling  didn&#x27;t make it quite early on. But this little guy had lots of heart :) I could pick him up in the air with the little cat bottle I had. He was so determined to get his fill :)

&gt; HI Jim.  I am sorry for your loss.  Our pets are the only family that really
&gt; does give unconditional love.  But I wanted to drop a note to tell you I
&gt; heard the &#x27;roar/meow&#x27; around the 8 sec mark and I heard it!  It very well
&gt; could be a cat&#x27;s meow.  Keep trying!
