<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree about the difference also.  All that review time makes for a
very tedious few hours.  By the end of it you&#x27;re ready to pull your
hair out.  I&#x27;ve only done two sessions now and have gotten more
positive results in 20 minutes time as I have in 10 years of EVP research.

&gt; Very interested. And I agree with you about the overnight change.  
&gt; Orgs like AA-EVP that aren&#x27;t dealing with the boxes are missing the  
&gt; boat.

&gt; &gt; Well guys, I have to tell you that since I started box sessions in
&gt; &gt; November I have become so spoiled that conventional EVP just don&#x27;t do
&gt; &gt; it for me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My organization was asked to come and do an investigation at a very
&gt; &gt; historial place (here in Illinois). The owner of this home asked if I
&gt; &gt; would bring one of the boxes to the home (he is amazed with the
&gt; &gt; immediately 2 way communication). So upon respectfully asking my tec
&gt; &gt; if it was alright to do a session outside the my home we did several
&gt; &gt; box sessions along with conventional EVP. We wanted to see if we could
&gt; &gt; discover some unanswered history about the residence, and the  
&gt; &gt; otherside
&gt; &gt; was more than willing to comply.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have to tell you that the regular EVP recordings were and are the
&gt; &gt; most boring data to review. Something I use to love so much has
&gt; &gt; actually turned into a project given I am waiting for a response
&gt; &gt; immediately! Too funny how things can change overnight!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I will be uploading some files for these sessions if you are  
&gt; &gt; interested.
