I'm not trying to say I know how a spirit could record on an analog record=
er, or if they can at all: my point was that it wasn't reasonable to assume=
 it could directly change the bits on digital media and wind up with anythi=
ng usable.

But, were I to conjecture, one might say that the air pressure =
of a voice is converted to a signal that modifies the magnetic properties o=
f a tape.=C2=A0 And a line recording uses a signal, not from the mic, but f=
rom some other source, to do the same.=C2=A0 So if that signal were to be m=
anipulated via external EMF, it would change the final result on the tape.=
=C2=A0 

Since we are also assuming that digital recorders can pick up spir=
its, then the simplest explanation is that that same up-front signal (befor=
e it gets digitized into bits) is also being manipulated.=C2=A0 And an EMF =
source could theoretically manipulate both the analog tape signal, and the =
digital tape signal.

However, it may be that an EMF source strong enough t=
o modify the signal would also effect all kinds of other things in the unit=
, including the final media itself.=C2=A0 It would be interesting for someo=
ne to determine what kind of external EMF is needed to induce or modify a s=
ignal in the pre-digital phase of the recording circuitry, and what side ef=
fects that would have.=C2=A0 Depending on the result, it could either revea=
l other ways to detect spirit influence, or prove that no spirit influence =
(via EMF) is happening.

a 
  question.
  

  
  
  
    
    
      Your points seems to be that yo=
u can make it work without 
        knowing how it works.=C2=A0 So we need =
to talk about what you mean by 
        that.

When you use the microphone,=
 you just speak, and let the 
        recorder do the rest.=C2=A0 In this c=
ase, you are using the recorder 
        without really knowing how it work=
s. =C2=A0 If a spirit can manipulate 
        the EMF field around the AtoD=
 converter (even without using the mic), 
        then they should be able =
to do the same: just use it without knowing how 
        it works: the reco=
rder does the rest.=C2=A0 In neither case do either of 
        you need to=
 know how it works, to get it to work. I am not questioning 
        this.
=

But, if they are going to change the bits on the actual 
        media the=
mselves, then they must know how it works, it order to get all 
        tho=
se bit-things I mentioned right.=C2=A0 The recorder can't "do the 
        =
rest", because by changing the bits on the media themselves, they are 
    =
    going completely around what the recorder does, and doing the details 
=
        themselves.=C2=A0 And as I said, the details there are very technic=
al, 
        and include things like converting their words into digital sa=
mples of 
        groups of a specific number of bits in a specific format =
on specific 
        places in specific orders with other specific other bi=
ts connected to 
        them like file ownership and dates and such.=C2=A0=
 It is the job, 
        basically, of a computer, not a person.

If they a=
re changing the 
        bits on the media, then the recorder is not doing =
that.=C2=A0 They are 
        no longer letting the recorder "do it", like =
you or they would be if 
        they just used it normally.=C2=A0 The reas=
on you can "make it work" 
        without understanding it, is because the=
 recorder is doing the work for 
        you.=C2=A0 If they are to change t=
he media directly, then the recorder 
        is no longer doing the work, =
and so they must understand all those 
        digital issues.

So that is =
the difference between being able to 
        use it without understanding =
it, and not being able to use 
        it.

e, one might say that the air pressure of a voice is converted to a signal =
that modifies the magnetic properties of a tape.  And a line recording=
 uses a signal, not from the mic, but from some other source, to do the sam=

oints seems to be that you can make it work without 
        knowing how it=

        that.<br><=
br>When you use the microphone, you just speak, and let the 
        record=
er do the rest.  In this case, you are using the recorder 
        wit=
hout really knowing how it works.   If a spirit can manipulate 
      =
  the EMF field around the AtoD converter (even without using the mic), 
  =
      then they should be able to do the same: just use it without knowing =
how 
        it works: the recorder does the rest.  In neither case do=
 either of 
        you need to know how it works, to get it to work. I am =
not questioning 
        this.<br><br>But, if they are going to change the =
bits on the actual 
        media themselves, then they must know how it wo=
rks, it order to get all 
        those bit-things I mentioned right. =
 The recorder can't "do the 
        rest", because by changing the bits on=
 the media themselves, they are 
        going completely around what the r=
ecorder does, and doing the details 
        themselves.  And as I sai=
d, the details there are very technical, 
        and include things like c=
onverting their words into digital samples of 
        groups of a specific=
 number of bits in a specific format on specific 
        places in specifi=
c orders with other specific other bits connected to 
        them like fil=
e ownership and dates and such.  It is the job, 
        basically, of=
 a computer, not a person.<br><br>If they are changing the 
        bits on=
 the media, then the recorder is not doing that.  They are 
        no=
 longer letting the recorder "do it", like you or they would be if 
       =
 they just used it normally.  The reason you can "make it work" 
     =
   without understanding it, is because the recorder is doing the work for =

        you.  If they are to change the media directly, then the reco=
rder 
        is no longer doing the work, and so they must understand all =
those 
        digital issues.<br><br>So that is the difference between bei=
ng able to 
        use it without understanding it, and not being able to =
use 
        it.<br><br><br><br>--- On <b>Wed, 5/20/09, April Abercrombie
