I have never captured an EVP, but many people have\n&gt; including those in this group. I cannot say (like James Randi\n&gt; apparently and others like him) that I think every person who captured\n&gt; an EVP is a fraud or captured a fluke or something like that. I don&#39;t\n&gt; think that at all, it appears to me that many of them are the real\n&gt; deal, of that I am almost 100% certain and will be 100% certain if I\n&gt; can ever capture my own.\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t know a lot about James Randi or EVP for that matter, but it is\n&gt; a question that came up. Can anyone enlighten me?\n&gt;\n&gt; I tried a few sessions last night but came up empty handed. I am\n&gt; starting to think my white noise isn&#39;t loud enough. I&#39;m going to keep\n&gt; trying.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also I hope to experiment with ITC images. And soon I want to build\n&gt; a &quot;box&quot; which I keep hearing so much about. I don&#39;t know the first\n&gt; thing about these ghost/spirit boxes as I&#39;ve heard them called, all I\n&gt; know is I want to learn to build one and use it as I&#39;ve heard some\n&gt; interesting audio files here. But that&#39;s probably a good subject for a\n&gt; separate post unless anyone can give me an informative how-to link or\n&gt; anything.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Angela\n&gt;"}
