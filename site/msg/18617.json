It&#39;s just a fact that you will make Frank\n&gt; mad again.\n&gt; For instance: IT is very obvious that when Frank gets something from the\n&gt; box about\n&gt; stuff that says what is going to happen, YOU have to say I will add that to\n&gt; your predictions.\n&gt; Those are not Frank&#39;s predictions, he is just posting the messages, and it\n&gt; is very clear\n&gt; that he does not like you saying or posting that those are his\n&gt; predictions.....\n&gt; Maybe you should pick your words a little better in the future, or better\n&gt; yet, maybe you should just\n&gt; not say anything, and just put the info in your little files to save, and\n&gt; no one would be\n&gt; the wiser..\n&gt; I&#39;m tired of giving you so much time in this group, so I hope I don&#39;t have\n&gt; to ATTACK you anymore LOL\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  ------------------------------\n&gt; *From:* EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] *On\n&gt; Behalf Of *Rj\n&gt; *Sent:* Tuesday, August 24, 2010 10:28 AM\n&gt; *To:* EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; *Subject:* RE: [EVP-ITC] A suggestion for less hostility\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   BTW, if anyone is wondering what I am talking about, this was a good\n&gt; example.\n&gt; I offer a suggestion on getting things back on track with less hostility,\n&gt; and I am immediately attacked for making the suggestion.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Tue, 8/24/10, Fransen, Debbie &lt;debbie.fransen@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Fransen, Debbie &lt;debbie.fransen@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] A suggestion for less hostility\n&gt; To: &quot;&#39;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&#39;&quot; &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, August 24, 2010, 7:16 AM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; that would be fine, if you didn&#39;t piss Frank off.......
