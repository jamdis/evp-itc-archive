<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I added a 12volt regulator to the existing radio power supply, it starts
out with 15 volts, and that is regulated down to 9 volts forth radio. With
12 volts available I added one of my sweep boards, mounted beside the
speaker. I just wanted to to see if my sweep was somehow creating the noisy
audio in my boxes.
 You don&#x27;t have to sweep the entire band to get good results, just covering
a few stations is adequate to supply the raw audio. When Stein was
experimenting with this back in the 80s, he would just wobble the tuning
around one point in the band--from what I understand, I&#x27;ve never been able
to e-mail him directly. Stein is a Danish researcher, and used the radio
method first, and I think he&#x27;s mentioned on the German VTF site.
