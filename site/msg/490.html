Hi Bill,
  I got what looks like my son in a luminator picture in 2004, but he and I looked so much alike that it was hard for me to tell.  I think it's at Mark's website still.
   
  I agree with you about MacRae and Presi--amazing.  The current issue of the ITC Journal is devoted to Marcello Bacci's work--also incredible.
   
  What's interesting about the idea of these guys recording themselves to prove it is that it seems a debunker mentality has a negative effect on getting results!  Of course, this is frustrating.  Nonetheless, sooner or later, I would think they would have to stand up and take notice.  After all, it wasn't long ago that the idea of  telephones was considered ludicrous and yet all these debunkers use them regularly with no problem at all as to their authenticity ;)  Vicki

should examine it again. 

I was equally impressed with Alex MacRae and Paolo Presi for their 
keen scientific scrutiny of the phenomenon. Even under close 
examination, some submitted EVP's appear to be genuine paranormal 
phenomenon. EVP recordings are being subjected to some of the most 
vigorous digital forensic analysis techniques available. Of course, 
many supposed EVP's can be debunked, but those considered supernatural 
in origin are classified as such due to audio characteristics that to 
not comply with our physical world as science currently understands 
it. I would recommend any of the doubters to not jump to conclusions 
until reviewing the work of some of these great researchers. 

Better yet, I recommend attempting to record EVP's themselves. Be 
patient, but diligent. Nothing convinces a person faster than personal 
experience.

Cheers, Bill
