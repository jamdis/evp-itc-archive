That's a great idea Steve and it was mentioned before but either no one noticed Misty's post or it was ignored. It would be a shame though if people start loosing files because they are not paying attention to the owners instructions.

            Misty,



I have and idea.  One solution is to post Mp3 files instead of Wav. 

files or any other format.  It seems like the Mp3's sound the same 

and are only 1/10th of the size.  I think that would probably clear 

up 90 percent of the board right there.  If i actually have more than 

a couple files from here on out, i will be attaching them to an e-

mail and not the board to save space here.  And also, if people do 

post files maybe we can all just have one post that says we have 

uploaded files to our folder instead of 30 audio announcements in a 

row that just seems to waste a lot of e-mail space in the individual 

e-mails.  And it also pushes the current topic on the board to 

another page and is lost for those who wanted to share.  Just my 

thoughts on helping the subject.  I know we are all excited, but 

misty is right.  I went to add a file the other day and the group was 

at 93 percent capacity, so it won't be long before we run out of 

space.
