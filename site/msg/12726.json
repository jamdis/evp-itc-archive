A man does legitimate research, backs it up \nwith data, and he is called a moron.\n\nThis is a very open minded approach.

He discussed the field of instrumental transcommunication\n&gt; &gt; (ITC), his study of the Spiricom case, Frank&#39;s Box, and EVP \n&gt; capture.\n&gt; &gt; It was during his discussion of Frank&#39;s Box where he brought up \n&gt; the name\n&gt; &gt; Chris Moon.  He also brought up exactly what he thought of Chris \n&gt; Moon&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; use of the Franks Box he calls his telephone to the dead.\n&gt; &gt; Better than writng about it, I&#39;ve placed a link to the audio from \n&gt; last\n&gt; &gt; night, at my post below.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/2008/11/chris-moon-and-his-use-of-\n&gt; franks&#92;\n&gt; &gt; -box.html\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/2008/11/chris-moon-and-his-use-\nof-\n&gt; frank&#92;\n&gt; &gt; s-box.html&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Mike (UFO Geek)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
