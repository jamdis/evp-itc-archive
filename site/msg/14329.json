If you can&#39;t hear them then it must be \n        eith=\r\ner mechanical (sound card or headphones)or maybe your hearing has \n        =\r\nloss in those frequencies.&lt;WBR&gt;...Some of these are not very clear or \n    =\r\n    loud enough too. But many will depend on your computer sound card &amp;=\r\n \n        your headphones. I have let an older man listen (in his late 60&#39;s=\r\n) and \n        he has heard most all of the audio. Same with a few guys at =\r\nwork. Some \n        hear them right away, and others can&#39;t until I loop the=\r\n actually EVP for \n        a few tries. I personally use a Dell Latitude D4=\r\n30 to hear these. I can \n        hear some on my cell phone. Headphones are=\r\n a must....or you won&#39;t hear \n        anything either way. *But some can be=\r\n heard on cell phone without \n        headphones. The conversion to MP3 has=\r\n also caused some loss, but I am \n        still able to hear them when I re=\r\nview from this site (but I have the \n        repetive hearing syndrome in t=\r\nhis area no doubt). Although I do have \n        some disbelief (shock) that=\r\n a few of these are not discernable.

And if you couldn&#39;t \n        hear the wh=\r\nistle...I would suggest the need to remove the cotton from \n        the ear=\r\n :) As for feedback....&lt;WBR&gt;.feedback from what? I only had one \n        re=\r\ncorder working here. I would rather hear someone say &quot;I&quot; made the \n        =\r\nwhistle....that would be more understandable. And is very true....if \n     =\r\n   someone &quot;tells&quot; the group that THIS is supposed to be what WAS said, \n  =\r\n      then is very difficult to clear the mind to hear it any other way.
