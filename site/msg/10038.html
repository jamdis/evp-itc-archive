  #1  You do not need to tell me what to buy and who to give it too.  You don't know shit about me and what I do or my financial situation with charity.  
   
  #2  I ask you to hold on to the Mini-Box, and you told me it wasn't going anywhere.  I got back on Sunday(with the cash to buy it), and I already saw where you where trying to sell it on the forums, and ebay.  So I said fuck it.
   
  #3  Do you really that people believe you made a mistake on setting the reserve, and pricing the Mini Box higher on ebay than what you could buy a knew one.  I've had many people email telling me the same thing.
   
  #4 You never offered me a speaker in the deal.
   
  #5 The amount of $400.00 to $450.00 you can buy a new Mini-box.  Example(If you go and buy a Car, and drive it off the lot it automatically looses value, just like if you buy something that is used should cost less than what you paid for a brand new one with a 2 year warranty.  Dude its used

  #6  Personally I don't give a shit about what you sell on ebay, but don't try do advertise on a forum about what your selling on ebay, if you don't want your ebay business on the forum.
   
  I am sick of this dumb ass pity shit,  If you have anything to say to me if should be taken care off in a private email.

  Peace Out!
   
  P.S.
  To the mods, and Frank I will never post a message like this again on the forum... But I will not let anybody run over me or anybody else.  I'm sorry for any disrespect I may have cause for anybody else.  I will not post anything about Bruce in this forum again or comment about his files.  Its over!

          William,
 
Please, I am doing my best to be civil.
 
The minibox was offered to you by me when you showed an interest in one.
For less than it cost me or is advertised for, plus I offered to pay shipping and give you the speaker 
and stand with it. Before I put it on ebay.
 
you chose not to accept my offer.
 
The listing on ebay has a subsatantially lower reserve price than 399.00, the speaker retails for another
25.00 plus tax and they did not ship the mini box to me for free.
 
So it is safe to say I'm into the whole thing for around 450.00 so I am taking a charitable loss.
 
You want to know what real charity is, You should buy the box on ebay and give it to a new researcher that can not afford one.
That would be a real act of charity.
 
Also I have given away quite a few boxes to new people, what has your contribution been.
Plus I don't know why my buisness on ebay is even being discussed on this forum!
 
Bruce

       Sorry Ann, I don't understand the way you use the word Charity.  How is it charity when your trying to get all your investment back?  No offense Bruce

  On the site of paranormal systems it give you an email that is Ron Ricketts email.  He told me that he builds the boxes one by one on his own when you place the order and it takes 5 to 10 day to receive the Mini box.  Kay, and I both are buying  a Crystal enhance Mini-Box with a two year warranty.  I can't wait till I get mine.
