Feedback loop methods use the cam to record itself recording itself...infinity. So for instance you could use a camcorder hooked up to your television showing a full screen live recording image of what the camcorder is recording. Then you take the camcorder and point it at the tv screen (angle depends on what person you ask) until it has created a feedback loop. You will start to see bright flashes of light and sometimes people record these images and find faces in them.
   
  The classic debunkers will say it is just our brains matrixing the images. I often say it to myself for some of the more fuzzy images I get. Matrixing is indeed a factual occurrence, but sometimes the images are so clear that everyones able to see its details.
   
  And when its a face you know, well it brings it to an entirely different level.
   
  Soon after I started doing the feedback loop method I started getting evp's about using a better light source. I thought they meant my rooms too dark but then they started showing me "tv face like" images using the feedback loop and mentioning use the tv thru evp. So one night instead of aiming the cam at the loop I aimed it towards something I had recorded on tv earlier that day. About 1-2 inches away from the screen (never use video that has people/faces already present) and later when I reviewed the recording I was shocked to see a sideways picture of one of the spirits that comes thru on evp. Once I flipped it I could see inside thier picture was a face that I didnt recognize. It was so clear it looked like someone had created it with one of those art programs. Except for the fact that the person in the picture looks older/healthier than they did while alive so there are no pictures in existence of that sort. 
   
  Sometimes they are just so amazing if I hadn't done it myself I probably couldnt believe it. LOL  So dont do it to prove anything to anyone else, most wont/cant believe...just try it for your own knowledge and research.
   
  You will need a program that allows you to view your recordings frame by frame and save images by copy pasting to paintbrush or something.
