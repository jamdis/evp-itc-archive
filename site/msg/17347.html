<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>When I first started making boxes in 2002, I assumed that the entities used
the bits of speech, music, and noise to form voices as the radio was swept
across it&#x27;s tuning range, so it&#x27;s not using a fixed frequency. Now days, I
have no idea how this stuff works, or how we get such clear voices that seem
to carry across as the radio covers several different stations, yet the
voice remains the same. There seem to be a RF component, or something they
actually transmit at times, other times they seem to remodulate the bits of
audio.

 The bellyaching is cuz we get these people that proclaim to know all about
how the voices are formed--in our heads and imply it&#x27;s all imagination.

&gt; Well, Iam new here to the group and sorry to say there sure is allot of
&gt; bellyaching with what little I have read. Anyway. Well, the radio dose work.
&gt; Believe it or not I know this first hand. Anyone can use it. But needs to be
&gt; used by a sensitive to realy work it accurately. It is a great tool for
&gt; paranormal reaches. The voices will come through vary clear. One thing I
&gt; would like to know is will they stay on one frequency when you dial it in
&gt; or, dose it always change? And sense the voices are coming through as a
&gt; frequency which is a form of electricity witch we are all made of, is there
&gt; a way of tuning just these waves? so we don&#x27;t here all the stations.

&gt; &gt; You&#x27;re rewriting what people are saying again. No one is &#x27;attacking&#x27; you,
&gt; and &#x27;denying all evidence&#x27;.Â  They are offering multiple interpretations of
&gt; results.Â  To expect everyone to &quot;buy your interpretation&quot; of everything
&gt; puts you in the same state that pisses you off about skeptics.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And to threaten to ban people who disagree with you - aren&#x27;t the ones
&gt; calling names and making attacks, aren&#x27;t the ones being obnoxious, aren&#x27;t
&gt; the ones getting religious - to threaten to throw those people out of the
&gt; compound, does not make the group better, or smarter, or more enlightened.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s makes it a cult.

&gt; &gt; Â More than enough to show any one in the world that reads these posts
&gt; how 100% unreasonable, unyielding, and ignorant these self proclaimed
&gt; skeptics truly are. They expect all of us to buy their version of what EVP
&gt; and the paranormal really is, all imagination, and anyone that disagrees
&gt; gets attacked. Time and time again the three here side steped the issue that
&gt; they completely ignore all evidence, and all expereince of just about anyone
&gt; else on the this group. Intead over an over imply it&#x27;s all imiagination and
&gt; delusion, and only they are smart enough to decern the truth.

&gt; &gt; Try not to get too religious, some discussion will be tolerated as long
&gt; as no one is offended. There is a &quot;banned&quot; button for those that get too
&gt; obnoxious. I don&#x27;t mind a good argument as long as it&#x27;s not taken too
&gt; serious, and people get pissed off, or hurt feelings. Try to be considerate
&gt; of others! If I detect attempts at debunking, I&#x27;ll ban immediately! It&#x27;s one
&gt; thing to be skeptical, it&#x27;s another to ignore and deny all evidence. &quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Â
&gt; &gt; Â Ignore and deny is excatly what these three skeptics are doing.
