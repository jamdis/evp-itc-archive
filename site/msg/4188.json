I also have the RS \nHack, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it works quite well, and certainly provides an economical \n&gt; &gt; alternative\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For the record, I have no vested interest in Mini-boxes, the \nhacks \n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any ITC devices.  I have stated opinions about the Mini and it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; advantages, and it&#39;s OK to have those used as testimonials. I \nam \n&gt; &gt; using\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a variety of devices in my work, and they are all valuable to \nme.  I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; travel a lot, so the Mini and the RSH will be the devices of \nchoice,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; especially since they are more portable and less fragile than \nthe \n&gt; &gt; FBs. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rosemary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sam_stout&quot; &lt;sam_stout@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new to this group, but not to ITC research. I&#39;m familiar \nwith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirit communications using boxes like Frank&#39;s, the mini-box, \nand \n&gt; &gt; RS\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hack. I&#39;ve seen the picture of Frank with the mini-box. \nFrank, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looks to me that you are promoting this mini-box. Is that \n&gt; &gt; correct? If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so, is it the only box that you are promoting now? Or are \nthey \n&gt; &gt; just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using your image and a few of your statements to push their \nbox? \n&gt; &gt; What\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I heard of the C2C show it seemed to me that it was more of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; promotion for the mini-box. They posted something about that \n&gt; &gt; their box\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has a cleaner signal and Frank&#39;s box had more noise to it. \nWell,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes in this line of work you want to have a little bit \nof\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inherent noise. I know that the RS radio has to meet FCC \nClass B\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regulations Part 15. As for being a cleaner signal, I would \nthink \n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the RS radio would actually be, than the mini-box. I have \nheard \n&gt; &gt; both\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mini-box and the RS hack and I can&#39;t tell a lot of \ndifferences\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; between the two except for the price. It&#39;s my understanding \nthat \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mini-box is selling around $400 and that&#39;s a lot of money for \n&gt; &gt; just a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AM radio. The RS radio is selling for $24.95 and I know \npeople are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; getting some great results with the RS hack. Just my two \ncents \n&gt; &gt; worth!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
