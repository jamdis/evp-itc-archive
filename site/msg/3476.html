I'll give him this: he has amazing balls to be using Frank'=
s device and tell ing the rest who are also using them that his is the only=
 one that works. If I were Frank, I'd be beating my head against the wall. =
Oh. Wait. He already is. 

What a total load of ego-driven crap. 

Chris, i=
f you're reading, may I suggest that you are the one who is falling victim =
to "false" communication? Or that your head is getting waaaay too big? Or i=
f you already know that you're just in it for the cash, that you find anoth=
er way to pay your bills?

You know, though, this same shit has happened to=
 every group of paranormal researchers since the field began. I've watched =
group after group come together and explode for thirty years because only t=
he Chosen had the right to control the message, would broke no criticism of=
 *any* of their own results *ever*, but had plenty of definitive pronouncem=
ents about everyone else's.

This is why I scoff at the idea of "Harmony," =
with the capital H. I have seen the concept used by everyone from the Warre=
ns in the 60s-70s to the Harsch-Fischbachs in the early 80s to Moon today t=
rying to use this idea of being somehow chosen and sacred in order to get "=
real" messages from spirit. Harmony is a way to control who gets to play an=
d IMHO, it's a load of nonsense.

Bruce, I have to tell you that the messag=
e you got the other day about us being all Kumbaya set my alarms off, perha=
ps innocently, but nonetheless. I've found there is such a fine line betwee=
n real peace between brothers working for the real common good and peace be=
tween brothers as a mechanism of control. Yes, we need to be at peace to wo=
rk together. But that peace has to be an inclusive peace. It has to be a pe=
ace within one's self above all else. It needs to be a *fearless* interior =
peace, too. The Harmony is within, folks. It's not judging whether others h=
ave it or not before we let them play. It is pure, unadulterated *internal*=
 knowledge about one's self. Judge not, lest ye be judged--remember that on=
e?

HMO YMMV, toujours,

Ann

Here is a blog steve sent me from moons myspace page as usual he's i=
n a panic because his fraudulent buisness is going down the tubes. he claim=
s to know the only way box communication can be achieved but who would know=
 better than the box inventor. Frank says it does not matter what means you=
 use it's the researcher that counts.and if moon is so omnipitent in this r=
esearch where are the documented recordings of his research, why are they n=
ot public for everyone to hear maybe because he's full of bull. he said rec=
ently that no one but him gets legitimate communication, well I think it's =
the other way around. chris if you read this, stop the cherade and have som=
e dignity. become a real researcher and stop trying to down everyone else s=
o you can continue to pray on the berieved and desperate people. And while =
I'm at it, if your so great why are you offering substantial discounts to y=
our so called ghost hunter university. I'll tell you why, because people ar=
e starting to realise you are nothing but a carnival side show palm raeder =
and have fooled people long enough. the reason I am addresing moon directly=
 on this group is I know he is lurking in the shadows to see what is happen=
ing with real researchers and will know at least what I think of him.I have=
 done more legitimate box research in one week than he has done ever. My re=
sults are posted I challenge him to do the same.here is a copy of his malic=
ious blog from myspace.chris moon's blog on myspace this morning ***Wednesd=
ay, November 28, 2007 The Box has hit the fan! Current mood: distressed Cat=
egory: Dreams and the Supernatural As so many of you know, I have been the =
primary tester of the Telephone to the Dead, a.k.a. "Frank's Box" since 200=
4, and have had great success using it in paranormal research, and more cur=
rently, connecting the living with those on the other side. I have recently=
 been made aware that there are several replica versions of this device bei=
ng sold. I have also been told of another device that can be purchased for =
very little from any electronics merchant and altered by hand, producing wh=
at some consider to be results. As I expected, the samples that people have=
 sent me are nothing more than timed radio scans that have no validity. Wha=
t is important to remember, before purchasing any of these replica devices,=
 is that the Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides on the other side have re=
peatedly explained that the way that the Telephone to the Dead technology w=
orks, is by spirit energy manipulating the random voltage generator (RVG) a=
nd using white and pink noise, as well as radio fragment, to create real ti=
me voice answers to questions posed from our side. The most important aspec=
t to this device is the medium operator who works as an antenna or "interpr=
eter" for living individuals asking the questions. Thomas Edison, in an int=
elligent spiritual discussion through the Telephone to the Dead, stated tha=
t there were only thirty of these individuals that could effectively use th=
e device. Four have been identified to this point. I have spent nearly four=
 years testing and doing paranormal research with the Telephone to the Dead=
, and I have built strong relationships with Spirit Technicians and Spirit =
Guides who I trust, and who trust me. These new "radio scanners" are not on=
ly a waste of money for people looking to do research with them in hopes of=
 having effective communication with the other side, but may in fact be ver=
y dangerous. Should demonic and other negative entities learn to use these =
false devices, the results could be devastating. Though I rarely see eye to=
 eye with the Catholic Church on the matter of using the Telephone to the D=
ead, I do admit that they predicted the widespread sale of false communicat=
ion devices as far back as last year. I have recently begun to receive requ=
ests from individuals asking for help to close negative doorways and portal=
s that they believe they opened using their purchased Telephone to the Dead=
 replica. Others are claiming that I am a fraud because their purchased dev=
ice doesn't produce the positive results I have been fortunate enough to ha=
ve, and claim that therefore, all of my results MUST be false. I can see th=
is spiraling out of control already. Once again, I will continue my researc=
h with the actual Telephone to the Dead as well as provide public demonstra=
tions and private readings for those truly interested in real time spirit c=
ommunication. Please feel free to contact me with any questions atBruce
