<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thank you for the help Juli.  I&#x27;ll be sure to use your log sheet.  I
do like their response to you telling them about the recorder. 

I&#x27;ve gotten a couple of smart ass responses to questions I&#x27;ve asked. 
I had my wife listen to them and she says it sounds like I&#x27;m answering
myself.  It&#x27;s nice to know there is some sort of personality on the
other side.

&gt;               I have posted a log sheet if you want to use it in the
file section. This may also help in aiding you with your sessions. 
Just remember once your rock n rolling your questions along with their
responses just may lead you in a direction you may never intended.  Be
quick on your feet, but try to preplan if you can.
&gt;    
&gt;              Also, I always try and ask them if they have any
questions for me or if I can deliver a message of any kind.  I never
want them to think that its all about me and getting the information I
WANT!  You would never have a conversation with a live friend always
taking over the topic.  For if that was the case I would not have any
friends, LOL.  
&gt;    
&gt;             You may also get communication for only you to hear, in
which case you may discover that your recorder has been turned off.  I
have attached a clip where I tell them to stop shutting up my recorder
and their response is sarcastic as if they had no clue to what I was
talking about.  I love their sense of humor!

&gt;           I totally agree. I&#x27;ll be honest, I did just wing it on
yesterdays
&gt; session. In the previous sessions I did remember to write down the
&gt; questions I wanted to ask ahead of time.

&gt; &gt; Jeremy,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Juli is right, it is very helpfull to have your questions thought
&gt; out before a session especially if the session is pertaining to a
&gt; certain topic.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you wing it, like juli said you will tend to speed up and overlap
&gt; the next question with the previous answer and then you think you did 
&gt; &gt; not recieve a response so you ask the same question again. I had
&gt; this happen a few day&#x27;s ago and when I repeated the question my tech&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; mike and lisa both said &quot;AGAIN&quot; they start to lose patience
&gt; sometimes, but you have to remember to them we must be like dealing
&gt; with kindergarten children.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Jeremy:
&gt; &gt; You may also want to try and ask the questions
&gt; quickly (I often times write them down prior to a session). The
&gt; reason being I have noticed that many people drag the questions or ask
&gt; more than one question prior to getting a response. Please note that
&gt; in my research I have on occasion spoken over them and get not the
&gt; immediate response because I was too busy talking. I have even gotten
&gt; from my tec David to (&quot;I&#x27;m Talking) which was funny cause anyone that
&gt; knows me, knows I love to gab, lol. I have attached to clips so you
&gt; can see what I am talking about. The first one David tells me that
&gt; basicly I needed to listen and not speak, for he was not done. The
&gt; second, Joel is asking a questions and the question seems to go on and
&gt; on, only to have David say &quot;Joel Speak Up&quot;.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In addition, I have also gotten as many as 3
&gt; spirits responding to your question at the same time. I believe Bruce
&gt; and Steve have experienced that on more than one occasion. Maybe they
&gt; could post or attach one of these files for an example. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; They know whats going on, and they will comply
&gt; with you and guide you along the way. Best of Luck and Great
&gt; Job!ecuyler &lt;ecuyler@&gt; wrote:

&gt; &gt; Sorry Bruce. I was so excited, I got carried away. When I&#x27;m
&gt; excited,I have a totally different thought pattern. I do understand
&gt; what you are saying though about doing it one questionat a time. I&#x27;ll
&gt; be sure to do that from now on. Thanks for the help.Jeremy--- In

&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Jeremy,&gt; &gt; There are quite a few answer or messages just in
&gt; this clip.&gt; My suggestion is to go over the clip a question at a
&gt; time.&gt; &gt; Put the whole recording into your editer and go to the
&gt; beginning&gt; of a question and then save the question and the preceeding
&gt; signalup to the next question.&gt; In a file of it&#x27;s own. Go over the
&gt; recorded data following thesingle question and look for specific
&gt; answers.&gt; to that question. If there are any save that answer to a new
&gt; file inthe editer and slow it or clean it a bit so it is
&gt; compehencible.&gt; then paste it back where it belongs in the question
&gt; file. You shouldnow have the question and answer in one file.&gt; Save it
&gt; and label it with the question and answer as one file.&gt; &gt; I hope you
&gt; understand that explination, if not fire back somequestions and I&#x27;ll
&gt; try to clarify.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; Bruce Halliday &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@: ecuyler@:

&gt; After listening again, I think the &quot;tells me to&quot; part is

&gt; new file on Esnips. It&#x27;sfairly big in size so I went&gt; ahead and put it

&gt; I did as Bruce had asked and just used the RS 20-125 with a
&gt; digital&gt;recorder and this is what I came up with. It&#x27;s a little over
&gt; 30&gt;seconds long. &gt; &gt; Bruce, if you still want to hear all of
&gt; thissession, I will put it&gt; all on Esnips. Just let me know. There
&gt; isquite a bit more to it&gt; than just this one clip. It&#x27;s amazing all
&gt; thethings that came through.&gt; &gt; Here&#x27;s a little background on the
&gt; file. Iasked two questions. The&gt; first was, &quot;Is the US governemnt
&gt; using ITCresearch?&quot; The second,&gt; &quot;How is the US goverment using ITC
&gt; research?&quot;I hear these things in&gt; this order: &quot;Yeah it is, just stop
&gt; it, juststop, you need help,&quot; and&gt; something toward the end that I
&gt; can&#x27;t quitemake out. Sounds like a&gt; couple of words and then &quot;tells me
&gt; to.&quot; Letme know what you think.&gt; &gt; Jeremy&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
