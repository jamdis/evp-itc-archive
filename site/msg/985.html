ect: [EVP-ITC] Freak me out!


  Well, had a film crew, and interviewers at=
 the house for almost three hours 
  yesterday. I was dreading it, didn't r=
eally want to go through with it, but 
  as usual, not as a bad as I had im=
agined. We did run the box for the camera, 
  and "they" were talking, and =
saying names of at least some prestent. It's 
  hard to catch it all  live,=
 so I hope it comes out on the video, and DVRs, 
  since the recordings wer=
e being done from monitor speaker on the box.

  It's very hard for me to a=
ccept being the focus of this kind of attention, 
  but I don't see the wor=
k stopping, so guess I best get used to it.

  Even my little Yorkie was fa=
scinated, instead of being scared to death of 
  everything, he seemed to b=
e very interestd in the cameras. Usually the dogs 
  bark and bark when som=
eone strange comes in the house, none of them acted 
  thay way with this c=
rew.

  Then there's the phone wierdness, maybe realted? for the last coupl=
e week my 
  cell would ring about 2:30AM, blockled number, and no one on t=
he it did that 
  last night, same thing. Then at about 4a, my phone rang, =
then my wifes cell 
  rang, then the house phone, all about a minute apart =
the last one, and the 
  same thing, blocked number. When it's answered, it=
's dead quiet.
