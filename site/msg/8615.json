If it were all in your head then you \ncan put over half this group on the cookoo list with ya and I&#39;d be \nright at the top of the list in the straightjacket =) I think you \nwill find most here have lost someone. Some more recently than \nothers. Some more pained by thier loss than anyone can imagine. Often \nits the inspiration for taking notice of whats important in life and \nwhere we go afterwards. I find the work very comforting and very \neducational. Ive lost too many to count but now I only grieve for \nmyself, mourn my own feeling of loss because I know they still exist \nand they are still around. Just in a different fashion than I was \nused to.\n\nMisty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kristin Morris&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; LK - thank you!  You&#39;re sweet to say that..  I didn&#39;t mean to bring \nthe\n&gt; board down.. I just found my clips fascinating.  I really feel like \nI was\n&gt; talking to Aly - my 17 year old nice.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; I hope it wasn&#39;t in my head!  Many of you heard my clips the way I \ndid or\n&gt; something really close to what I heard so that is kinda cool for me!\n&gt; \n&gt; Hugs back,\n&gt; \n&gt; k\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] On \nBehalf Of\n&gt; Laura Kimberley\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, March 30, 2008 4:55 PM\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] Re: Clips from this morning Mar 30\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Aww, Kristin, \n&gt; \n&gt; I am so sorry for your loss Huny, \n&gt; \n&gt; I am like Margaret sending you arms of lots of  hugs and love your \nway\n&gt; sweetie. \n&gt; \n&gt; God Bless you.\n&gt; \n&gt; LK\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] On \nBehalf Of\n&gt; itcdeadpeople\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, March 30, 2008 4:18 PM\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Clips from this morning Mar 30\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, Kristin. I&#39;m SO sorry to read of your loss. That is awful. I \nthink it is\n&gt; strange how grief \n&gt; can whip back on us, sometimes seemingly out of the blue, as if no \ntime has\n&gt; passed. Once in \n&gt; a while, for no apparent reason, I will have one of those days \nwhere it just\n&gt; brings me to my \n&gt; knees, even after years. Four months is not a long time at all and \nit is\n&gt; perfectly \n&gt; understandable how your grief could be so raw in this moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sending big &#39;feel better&#39; hugs your way!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups &lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt; .com,\n&gt; &quot;Kristin&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As many of you know I lost both my niece and my nephew about 4 \nmonths\n&gt; &gt; ago. I was doing fine but this morning was rough. I spent time\n&gt; &gt; talking to their mom and I sorta lost it after. I did a session \nand\n&gt; &gt; the clips are from that. Look for them in a a few..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; k\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
