EM waves at the VLF and=A0ULF level can give off sound but only as a second=
ary phenomenon. It sounds like a low hum to some people! I believe the most=
 famous of these phenomenon was caused by HAARP.

=A0
A mistake that a lot of people make is thinking that =
there are two different types of energy at work when it comes to sound wave=
s and electromagnetic waves. The only thing that seperates them is frequenc=
y and power. Radio waves are radio waves because they occupy a certain bloc=
k of the electromagnietic spectrum. Sound waves exist on that same spectrum=
 just farther down with much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic waves ca=
n penetrate almost anything because of their wavelengths. The shorter the w=
avelength the more ways we can shield against them.
=A0
Think of microwaves=
. These are also a type of radio and telemetry transmitting wave but the wa=
ves also have a physical effect on our environment by causing molecules to =
speed up, which creates heat. A little lower than this is IR or infrared it=
 too can cause physical objects to heat up but usually it just causes molec=
ules to rotate in place. All physical things give off IR light. Its a way t=
he total system conserves energy by spontaneously emitting IR radiation.

Here is some food =

It was me and another girl teammate=A0present in the room. I picke=

We were standing right next to another digital video recorder that I leave =

This insta=

 Re: [EVP-ITC] New ideas








I have a running theory that EVP is carrie=
d on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to manif=
est. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves=
 that differ one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them toge=
ther you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a gho=
st is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room crea=
ting an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate dif=
ference=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz=
). This was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultraso=
nic signals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt that EV=
P were generated within a few inches of the recorder.
=A0
We are able to re=
produce this affect in not only radio with superheterodyne systems but also=
 with acoustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a commercial produc=
e called the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.
