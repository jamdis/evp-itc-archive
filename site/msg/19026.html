<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s spelled &quot;urchin&quot; and it&#x27;s a term you hardly ever see used anymore. It
means &quot;a street child&quot; and was sometimes used as a term of affection.

I once asked &quot;Do you want us to leave?&quot; on an investigation and got a
response &quot;You just got here.&quot;

&gt; See endoffilewow.mp3 in my files folder. This was the very end of the
&gt; session my husband and I did at night in Charles Town, WV cemetery, on
&gt; October 15.
&gt;
&gt; Notice:
&gt; A man whose voice persists through several seconds of the file saying...
&gt; &quot;you...too...erchin...wonderful&quot; what the heck is erchin, lol! Here you
&gt; should also notice that between &quot;erchin&quot; and &quot;wonderful&quot; there is a definite
&gt; station change &quot;whine&quot; sound...
&gt;
&gt; Then you may also notice when I ask &quot;Should we come back ever?&quot; A lady
&gt; says, &quot;Ever?&quot; or &quot;Never&quot; can tell which....
&gt;
&gt; We&#x27;re getting some pretty convincing stuff for having been doing less than
&gt; a month.
