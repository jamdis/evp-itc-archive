 I think the price is mostly cuz it's still limited production. If someone=
 was pumping out thousands, or millions it would be much cheaper.  It costs=
 me maybe $100 to make one of mine, but that doesn't include the time it ta=
kes to put it together. Even at $500 I would be reluctant to sell the boxes=
, just because of the time it takes.
