  Yes, you need speical permission. I was there=
 for an all night ghost hunt as a guest of Eastern Paranormal. The place ca=
n be rented at night but believe me when i say "it ain't cheap". Plus I don=
't think the prison would appreciate me releaseing the inmates before their=
 eternal sentence has been served.

  Does one need special permission to get in there?  You folks shou=
