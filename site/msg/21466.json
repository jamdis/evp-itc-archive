The reality of the situation is 90% of the time when a &quot;haunted&quot; locatio=\r\nn is  investigated nothing happens. When we visit a location we educate our=\r\nselves prior to the visit concerning the story behind the lore and take it =\r\ninto account and attempt to either  confirm or disprove the different stori=\r\nes, and usually there are several different versions of the same legend.

Many locations that are visited have strict &quot;No Tresp=\r\nassing&quot; rules put in effect by the local police (or County Sheriff) due to =\r\nmany &quot;troublemakers&quot; flocking to the areas after hearing about it from popu=\r\nlar magazines or TV shows, and sometimes that does ruin it for the investig=\r\nators that are there simply to observe and document the place before it get=\r\ns torn down by modern convenience.\n \nOur primary scope of location is South=\r\nern New Jersey since that is where we are based out of, but we have been in=\r\nvited and will also document other locations.
