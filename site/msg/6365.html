&gt; Jeremy,
&gt;  
&gt; Go to it buddy, good luck!
&gt;  
&gt; This is a great adventure you are taking your first steps on.
&gt; If you find yourself triping once in a while we will be here with 
&gt; a hand to grab on to.
&gt;  
&gt; Just remember the only stupid question is the one left un asked.
&gt; If you need anything let me know.

&gt; Just picked up and modified the RS 20-125. Before I gave it a
testrun, I made it clear I was only doing a test and that I did not
intendto make any contact. About half way through the first sweep, I
heardmy name. Very exciting and somewhat startling at the same time.
Hopefully Ican get time to do an actual session tonight. I understand
it cantake some time for the box to get &quot;imprinted&quot; as Bruce says.
Thank you Steve for finding this hack and thanks to the others herefor
your endless help to everyone on the board.Jeremy
