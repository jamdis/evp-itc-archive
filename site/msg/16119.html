Hi Zack,

You fail to mention all the dishwashers, laundry equipment, refri=
gerators, stoves, ovens, and ice machines in every home.=A0 All the medical=
 equipment in the hospitals. 
These devices have all come to use computer b=
oards in them.=A0 

We have frequent storms here on the Texas Gulf Coast.=
=A0 I can't begin to tell you how barbaric we become with the extended loss=
 of electricity.=A0 Radiation would be far worse and more wide spread.

gards,

                  It depends on what radia=

EMP (electromagnetic pulse) generated at the time of a nuclear deto=

Does anyone here know anything about radiation? In particularly if i=

Thanks!
