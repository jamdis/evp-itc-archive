sounds like what we heard was person  (female) reporting second event over cell phone.
   
  weather or em effects cannot cause such things but timing could be effected.
   
  we couldnt determine anything about location because we were hearing a telephone like voice and only one side of conversation.  it was not a radio station -no i.d.

   
  periods of heightened risk can be forecast accurately this way- and SHOULD be-  usually, though , the law enforcement types accuse you of being involved because that makes less paperwork for them, so beware.  im speaking from experience on this.
   
   
   
   
   
  The bloodbath took place at opposite sides of the 2,600-acre campus,
beginning at about 7:15 a.m. at West Ambler Johnston, a coed dormitory
that houses 895 people, and continuing at least two hours later at
Norris Hall, an engineering building about a half-mile away, 
authorities
said.
Police said they were still investigating the shooting at the dorm when
they got word of gunfire at the classroom building.
