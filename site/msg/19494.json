Do you get better quality or more evp&#39;s during those times or is there no change? If so, what is the &quot;window of opportunity&quot; for using an eclipse for get paranormal activity, be it video, radio, digital recorders, etc. for the eclipse (3 days before, 3 days after, etc.)?\n\nDoes an eclipse influence paranormal activity during those times? Any insight would greatly be appreciated.\n\nCB"}
