Did you try to play the same wav file in another\naudio program than EVPmaker on your PC?\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Steve, Stefan, or Bruce\n\n&gt; I have got a problem with my EVP maker.  I clicked on the yellow play \n&gt; button, and I got a Wave out Error that says &quot;The specified format is \n&gt; not supported or can not be translated.  Use the Capabilities function \n&gt; to determine the support formates&quot;.  Then I thought since I had wave \n&gt; pad open that was the problem, but I shut wave pad down.  Its still is \n&gt; saying the same thing.  I am trying to use it on Windows 2000 \n&gt; Professional on my Home cpu.  Please let me know if there is away I can \n&gt; fix my problem.  \n\n&gt; EVP maker works on my laptop, but not my home cpu.\n\n&gt; Thanks \n\n&gt; Rees"}
