<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Interesting approach. In the video demo at about 4:31 into the video it sounds like &quot;look Mike hello&quot; said twice. And it sounded like something about light in there too but wasnt clear enough for me to be sure.

A couple others here were using diodes to record with instead of microphones but theres sounded alot different. Not sure how they set those up. You know me I always go for the easy to do stuff hehehe but I believe Frank Ratka tried using diodes and hmm maybe retro Dave did once? You&#x27;d have to ask them.

&gt; Greetings fellow researchers,
&gt; 
&gt; Well... I&#x27;ve completed another prototype diode device
&gt; for EVP capture.  
&gt; This one I put in a clear case so you can see the circuit. 
&gt; It is 
&gt; similar to the first one I designed (Device #1) and built,
&gt; except this 
&gt; one (Device #2) uses a slightly different coil with ferrite
&gt; core and 
&gt; different diodes. Their breakdown voltage is less than the
&gt; first I used.
&gt; 
&gt; You can see pictures of it here:
&gt; http://www.ufogeek.com/mikes_diode_evp_device.htm
&gt; 
&gt; It&#x27;s on the webpage, below Device #1.
&gt; 
&gt; The audio from my first test is here:
