Can you clarify how your RS hack system is set-up when \nyou are receiving messages such as this one and in the files: &quot;11-26-\n07_radio shack hack files_bruce&quot;.  They seem much cleaner than what I \nam getting with the 12-469.  Are these recorded right out of the \nspeaker with an amped mic picking up your voice and the speaker \nsounds?\n\nThanks...\n\nLC\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; guy&#39;s\n&gt; \n&gt; During a session with the RS 470 my technition mike told me that \nour \n&gt; fellow researcher Jeff&#39;s uncle was going to die from suffering a \nstroke.\n&gt; \n&gt; I informed jeff of the message and sent him the file. He wrote back \n&gt; asking If I could confirm this and get his uncles name.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did another quick session with the RS 470 and recieved the name \nmark \n&gt; from my guide lisa just once and then mike and lisa both shouted \nBOB,BOB\n&gt; die. \n&gt; \n&gt; I notified Jeff of this and he confirmed he had both an uncle Mark \nAnd \n&gt; an uncle Bob, after inquiring about the condition of his uncle Bob \nhe \n&gt; was informed that his uncle Bob was hospitalised and graveley ill.\n&gt; \n&gt; He has not as of now suffered a stroke thank god, but jeff seems to \n&gt; think his prognoses is not good.\n&gt; \n&gt; I ask that we all say a prayer for Uncle Bob.\n&gt; \n&gt; I posted this and the accompanying file for pure research sake.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff has said he will keep me posted and I will appropriately keep \nthe \n&gt; group informed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;"}
