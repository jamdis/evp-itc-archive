Sometimes it&#39;s hard on here to figure out which post is replying to which!\n\nSo I&#39;ve been thinking about this over and over -- I&#39;ve been able to think of little else in the last few days -- trying to figure this out and make some sort of reasonable theory I can live with.  I know we will never have a true answer, at least not any time soon, but surely those who have been doing this for years and years must have a working theory on what these entities are?  Based on their behavior rather than what they say?  Based on consistencies from researcher to researcher?  Based on things these entities know and don&#39;t know (e.g. knew my dad&#39;s friend Gordy was dead, while I did not)?"}
