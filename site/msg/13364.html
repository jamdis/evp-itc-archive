&gt; I found the book.
&gt;
&gt; It is called &quot;The Diary and Sundry Observations of Thomas Alva Edison&quot;  the
&gt; copyright for the edition I have is 1948.  Since only a limited number of
&gt; 1st printings have Chapter 8, &quot;The Realms Beyond&quot;, then I suspect 1948 would
&gt; be the date of the first printing.
&gt;
&gt; Each chapter ends with the year Mr. Edison wrote it (it is primarily his
&gt; diary).  The part about spirit communication is dated 1922.
&gt;
&gt; Obviously a 61 year old book is a bit fragile so I&#x27;ll start trying to scan
&gt; those pages but I&#x27;m not going to hurt the book for it.
&gt;
&gt; I suppose I just post them as JPGs in an email?  There is not a place to
&gt; upload files here is there?  Well I know there is but I thought we were not
&gt; supposed to use it.

&gt;  Thanks for the link! Very interesting. I went to Edison&#x27;s place down here
&gt; in Florida in search of any information on the subject.
&gt; I found nothing. It was rumored that the executors of the estate had
&gt; anything of the sort removed.
&gt; I lost both my grandad and an uncle last month. People change their minds
&gt; about the afterlife. I&#x27;ve seen it first hand!
&gt; How old was Edison when this article was written?
&gt; Thanks

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have one of a handful of the Edison Autobiography that has the last
&gt;&gt; chapter with his thoughts on the great beyond.  His family had that version
&gt;&gt; of the biography recalled and reissued it without the last chapter.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anyway in this last chapter, Edison alludes to a way to communicate with
&gt;&gt; the dead but he never says he did it.  He simply hypothesizes on how it
&gt;&gt; could be done and the fact that the dead are just on a different wavelength
&gt;&gt; than the living.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sorry, no links...  This is from that old fashioned thing called a book
&gt;&gt; :))
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I can tell you how to find your own copy though if you wish.  I need to
&gt;&gt; find the actual page count from my copy but I went to amazon&#x27;s used books
&gt;&gt; and asked every seller how many pages their copy was.  The first one to
&gt;&gt; respond with the correct (bigger) number, that was the one I bought.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Don
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; PS but don&#x27;t spend alot.  The info in the last chapter is not worth much.

&gt;&gt;  I suppose ultimately, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if Edison made a
&gt;&gt; telephone to the dead or not. Modern researchers in this field will
&gt;&gt; have to stand on their own results anyway, and if they&#x27;ve managed to
&gt;&gt; discover something that Edison never achieved, good for them!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have also heard varied claims: that Edison did make this box; that
&gt;&gt; Edison was working on it but never finished it; that Edison was joking
&gt;&gt; when he mentioned working on it. So for my own sake, I&#x27;d like to know
&gt;&gt; the real story.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If you have a link to where you got your information from his
&gt;&gt; assistants and staff, I would really like to read it. Please make
&gt;&gt; sure it is as close to the source material as possible, and not
&gt;&gt; someone quoting someone quoting an article. For example, here is a
&gt;&gt; link to the actual New York times article on Edison discussing his
&gt;&gt; views of life after death:
&gt;&gt; http://query. nytimes.com/ mem/archive- free/pdf? _r=1&amp;res=
&gt;&gt; 9903EEDC1F39E333 A25751C0A9669D94 6196D6CF&lt;http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9903EEDC1F39E333A25751C0A9669D946196D6CF&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That is the kind of link I&#x27;d be hoping for regarding your statements.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks for any info.
