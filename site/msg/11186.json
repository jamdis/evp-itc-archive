People\n&gt; have recorded evp using a variety of methods and tools and\n&gt; conditions. I&#39;ve even had an instance that chainsaw\n&gt; noise was being used and I was able to record some of the\n&gt; speech.\n&gt; Musical instruments such as guitar and piano tones have\n&gt; also yeilded some results. Ive posted some in the files\n&gt; section here of a few methods and alot on esnips.

I never\n&gt; &gt; tested this with a recorder, but I&#39;ve caught some\n&gt; evps\n&gt; &gt; with refrigerator motors and other devices. Audacity\n&gt; has\n&gt; &gt; the &quot;add white noise&quot; option, which allows\n&gt; you to\n&gt; &gt; record directly to your computer and allow the\n&gt; entities to\n&gt; &gt; organize the generic white noise. I&#39;m eager to try\n&gt; &gt; that. An excellent observation you had, Misty. I think\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; must grab hold of any babbling or whirring noise\n&gt; available\n&gt; &gt; to communicate, whether we&#39;re able to pick it up\n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; not. That&#39;s why I carry around one of the\n&gt; lightweight\n&gt; &gt; Olympus recorders -- no telling where you&#39;re going\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; find a babbling-brook or steady motor sound.

There are parts of the spectrum that is just\n&gt; &gt; outside of that \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; spectrum that might provide a better form of\n&gt; communication.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Al\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ____________ _________ _________ _________\n&gt; _________\n&gt; &gt; _________ _\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Click here for great computer networking\n&gt; solutions!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://thirdpartyof fers.juno. com/TGL2131/\n&gt; &gt; fc/Ioyw6iighEHwM AbLKMUuYo359E\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 28alDzNnXaMa5yrqURX jmUoY4EK4/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Netscape.
