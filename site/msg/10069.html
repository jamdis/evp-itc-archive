<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I hear that point very clearly and i&#x27;m not doubting communication 
with the box, i hear messages all the time that are clear to me.  But 
i can&#x27;t seem to get a full message that is clear enough that other 
people can hear too.  And some want our posts to be unamed files, so 
they can&#x27;t be misled to hearing what we hear.  That has never worked 
out either, i&#x27;m just saying there has to be another way that can be 
clearer.  Maybe a clearer box will be made in the future....who knows.

&gt; That is funny! I was thinking the same thing while listening to 
those recordings.
&gt;    
&gt;   In a box recording you can get an assemblance of male or female, 
and you can even get language accents. ie british, indian, spanish, 
etc...
&gt;    
&gt;   With the allophone/soap, you have one electroinic voice.
&gt;    
&gt;   So lets say you are recording, and like you said, you have two 
spirits speaking at the same time. happens quite a bit with box 
radio, how does the researcher discern who is talking. Even if the 
spirits say at the beginning that this is bobby sue or james, you can 
not tell the difference.
&gt;    
&gt;   Imagine if the allaphone voice sounded like HAL 9000!

the box or 
&gt; soapsound.
&gt; 
&gt; I personnally dont like the robotic sounding voice with the 
&gt; soapsound. You can never tell whos talking everyone sounds the 
&gt; same.

&gt; &gt; Yeah, i think i hear that too. I&#x27;m probably going to just scrap 
&gt; this 
&gt; &gt; session, i spent 2 hours going over 45 seconds to bring out a 
&gt; message 
&gt; &gt; that&#x27;s so unclear to everyone else. It&#x27;s so frustrating that the 
&gt; &gt; radio method is so flawed, i want it to be clear and it never is. 
&gt; &gt; And if i do get something that&#x27;s interesting, most people will 
say 
&gt; &gt; it&#x27;s just radio anyway. That&#x27;s why i&#x27;m trying to get away from 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; radios, although it&#x27;s robotic sounding---sound soap has been the 
&gt; best 
&gt; &gt; so far. Clearer and longer messages, with hardly any editing. 
&gt; The 
&gt; &gt; boxes are unable to get full sentences from them and i don&#x27;t care 
&gt; &gt; what anybody else claims to get. You will get some good &quot;yes&quot; 
&gt; &gt; and &quot;no&quot; answers, but the rest will be questioned and heard 
&gt; &gt; differently by others. What does everyone else on this board 
&gt; think 
&gt; &gt; about this?
