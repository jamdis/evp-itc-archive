I&#39;m doing it right now LOL. I dont know why it \npicks some people. Some are very active posters others just now and \nthen but the run on replys it attaches to bottom may be to blame. I \ndont get blocked here when I dont delete whats below but I get \nblocked on other boards and have to wait til a mod approves it. It&#39;s \nno big deal I am in and out anyway so by the time I get off work its \nusually been approved and posted. \n\nMaybe someday yahoo will fix thier format. There are other places to \nput up forums but they all have thier quirks. \n\nMisty\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Bryan Whatley &lt;bryan_whatley@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks Misty, Kristin, and everyone.  I wasn&#39;t sure if it was \nsomething I was doing wrong.  I used to moderate several bulletin \nboards and still moderate one other, so I see where your coming from \nas far as replies to a lengthy thread.  Most of the messages I&#39;ve \nsent are to other peoples posts.\n&gt; \n&gt; :)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; From: Misty &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, April 5, 2008 10:31:34 PM\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Just wondering if others emails are lost- \nNOTICE TO ALL MEMBERS!!\n&gt; \n&gt;                 Hiyas\n&gt; \n&gt; I said this before but some of you may have missed it. For those \nwho \n&gt; post messages to group and nothing seems to go thru. No you are not \n&gt; moderated, no you are not blocked. The yahoo groups spam filters \n&gt; sometimes view your posts as spam and make it so that a mod has to \n&gt; approve it before its posted. This is not our doing and nothing we \n&gt; can do to change it. Bruce seems to be its favorite target and Ive \n&gt; done everything short of makin him owner to try and get it to quit \n&gt; doing it. But at least once a day it chooses one of his posts and \n&gt; marks it. As well as others here who are frequent posters.\n&gt; \n&gt; The bigger the group gets the more I see. Unfortunately for you \nguys \n&gt; I work and the other mods are out of town so today the posts had to \n&gt; sit in the spam box until I get home and click the approval. \n&gt; \n&gt; Things will run smoother when the others get back. So relax. I know \n&gt; its annoying sometimes its happened to all of us.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only thing I have noticed is when it does mark a post as spam \nit \n&gt; usually is a run on message with lots of other peoples posts in it. \nI \n&gt; said usually...it happens to Sumption sometimes too and he always \n&gt; removes the extra stuff now and I havent seen his posts in the spam \n&gt; box for a long time. I dont know if thats it, all I can see is I \n&gt; notice you can attempt to prove that one on your own. \n&gt; \n&gt; A little test for Bruce (especially you Bruce because it really \nlikes \n&gt; to block you), Kristen, Rees, Bryan, and Jeremy. You guys posts \nwere \n&gt; all waiting for me when I got home tonight. Upon looking at them at \na \n&gt; glance I can see they are run on messages. Not doing anything wrong \n&gt; just hittin reply and it copies the previous to yours. It&#39;s just a \n&gt; fluke in thier spam filter. I guess it sees 4-5 peoples emails and \n&gt; responses and sees it as a chain letter or something who knows? \nJust \n&gt; try it and see if it helps things go thru quicker.\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, &quot;Kristin Morris&quot; &lt;ckmorris95@ ...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes Bryan - I have had messages take as long as 4 to 5 hours to \n&gt; come through\n&gt; &gt; and others get caught in my spam filter.
