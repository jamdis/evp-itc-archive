Bruce tha=\r\nnks for the criticism and advice on doing them better. I do tend to over ki=\r\nll my files with alot of noise reduction and filtering. The reason they don=\r\n&#39;t sound like RS box files is that I weed out just the voice I hear without=\r\n all of the background clutter. Most of the time. Another thing is that my =\r\nhearing is acute in the low frequency range. I have hearing loss in the hig=\r\nh upper frequencies. That&#39;s why I can hear what others tend not to hear. Al=\r\nso I find that when you listen to these with different types of speaker sys=\r\ntems and different formats like MP3&#39;s and Wav files and Aiff files and Ogg =\r\nfiles they sound completely different. I have also found that using differe=\r\nnt headphones can effect the sounds too in the way you hear them. Bruce som=\r\ne of your files I hear something all together different then what you say t=\r\nhey said ,but that could be my hearing is different than yours and my sound=\r\n system may be different than yours. I&#39;m not sure. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a diffic=\r\nult thing to interpret these sound files sometimes. You have some I can rea=\r\nlly hear what you said they were saying and others not. Your right in the f=\r\nact that I do tend to take too much away from the file with noice reduction=\r\n and I&#39;ll have to cut back on that ,and to copy more of the background nois=\r\ne so everyone knows it&#39;s from the RS 12-469 model. Bruce I appreciate your =\r\nadvice alot. keep me informed on anything I&#39;m doing wrong with these boxes =\r\nsince I am new to this and you pretty much know more about them than I do. =\r\nSince I have mostly worked with Tradional EVP&#39;s and this is a completely di=\r\nfferent kind of venue to work with and research I hope you all will help me=\r\n out and point me in the right direction. The thing is I hear these files a=\r\ns clear as anything. Maybe I&#39;m just matrixing what I hear on the boxes I do=\r\nn&#39;t know. All I know is that what I have on here all came from the RS 12-46=\r\n9 Box and I have alot to learn from the group on recording them and so fort=\r\nh. I want to thank everyone with their comments and for their help in this =\r\nresearch here with EVP-ITC it&#39;s very interesting to say the least. I hope y=\r\nou all are doing okay and I hope that my files get better and more understa=\r\nndable as I do my research in this study with all of you. Thanks again !!!!=\r\n!Regards,Ralph the Ghost HunterI forgot I wanted to ask you Bruce and anyon=\r\ne else on here what is the Scan rate on your boxes ? On my RS 12-469 it&#39;s 1=\r\n7 seconds to make a complete linear scan. On the RS 12-470 it&#39;s 11 seconds.=\r\n On the RS 20-125 it&#39;s 11 seconds too. What should the Scan rate be ? Just =\r\nwondering if other people have different scan rates than mine. Does that ma=\r\nke a diffence in getting better quality voices ?
