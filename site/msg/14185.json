However, for wav files, the c=\r\nompression during email is not loss less. \n\n          I used to think as yo=\r\nu do, in that the emailed attachment of a wav file would not loose anything=\r\n. After a lengthy discourse with another member here, I learned that I was =\r\nwrong. The reason why I did not realize it in the first place is that when =\r\nI would email a wav file, I would intentionally keep it in very small segme=\r\nnts, to keep file size down. This was just for ease of transfer. But becaus=\r\ne of this, I had not experienced any noticeable loss.\n\n          Now it may=\r\n be in some cases, depending on the servers or what have you that the file =\r\ngoes through, that the loss may be less or more. But once the attachment is=\r\n downloaded, the quality has been found to be less then the original wav.\n\n=\r\n          Again though you can only really tell when the wav file is large.=\r\n\n\n          ----- Original Message ----- \n            From: Rj \n           =\r\n To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com \n            Sent: Sunday, May 10, 2009 1:36 =\r\nPM\n            Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n\n\n              =\r\n    The kind of compression that occurs during an email attachment is &quot;loss=\r\nless&quot;: it compress the file cleverly without losing information.  For examp=\r\nle, if I had a program in some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it cou=\r\nld compress it.  But if it lost even one bit, the resulting exe file would =\r\nnot execute again after it was uncompressed on the other side.\n\n           =\r\n       This kind of compression does things like looking for common pattern=\r\ns in the file, and replacing them with a token.  A rough example would be i=\r\nf it found &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot; in a file 20 times, it could replace all the oc=\r\ncurances with say $HN1.  And also write a little dictionary in there somepl=\r\nace that says &quot;$HN1=3DHowdy Neighbor&quot;.\n\n                  When the file get=\r\ns to its destination it can be uncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are=\r\n replaced with &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot;.  So it was compressed (instead of 14 chara=\r\ncters each, it only needed 4, plus the dictionary), but lost no data.\n\n    =\r\n              Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not lossless.  Depending=\r\n on the level of compression, some level of data is lost, and so cannot be =\r\nrecovered or reconstructed later.\n\n                  Rick\n\n\n\n              =\r\n    --- On Sun, 5/10/09, April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch=\r\n. com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n                    From: April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrom=\r\nbiegh ostresearch. com&gt;\n                    Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File upl=\r\noading rules\n                    To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n             =\r\n       Date: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 10:26 AM\n\n\n\n                    Another =\r\nthing:\n\n                    I recently found this out. When you email a fil=\r\ne, if it is not saved as a compressed format, the email filtering process w=\r\nill actually compress the file automatically.\n\n                    So even =\r\nif you have attached a wav. file, it will loose resolution over the email p=\r\nrocess. It will not sound exactly the same as the original wav. file. How m=\r\nuch it differs depends on the size of the file you are attaching. If it is =\r\na very large file, it will sound much different.\n\n                    The o=\r\nnly exception to this is if the wav. file is small enough that the filterin=\r\ng process will ignore it. It has to be pretty small though, like under 1 MB=\r\n (I am not exactly sure of the threshold).\n\n                    The best wa=\r\ny to share files over the internet if you want them as close to the origina=\r\nl as possible is to upload them directly to a website.\n\n                   =\r\n   ----- Original Message ----- \n                      From: Rj \n          =\r\n            To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com \n                      Sent: Sunda=\r\ny, May 10, 2009 10:54 AM\n                      Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File =\r\nuploading rules\n\n\n\n                            Pixelization doesn&#39;t clean-u=\r\np the data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking a picture of a field of flowers=\r\n, and beginning to add levels or pixelization to the picture.  Soon, you wo=\r\nuld not be able to tell there were flowers there at all.  You would see a l=\r\not of colored blocks.\n\n                            Or in the other directio=\r\nn, imagine you are looking at a competely randomize bunch of pixes on your =\r\nscreen: a complete screen of truely random static snow.  Pixelizing this, a=\r\nfter a while, you would again start to see colored blocks.\n\n               =\r\n             What&#39;s happening is that it is processing an area of the image=\r\n, taking (for instance) the average value of that entire area, and replacin=\r\ng all the blocks in that area with the average.  In video processing, this =\r\nwould result in a field of multi-colored flowers being replaced by, for ins=\r\ntance, a big greyish-bluish block, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the =\r\nnoise example, it maybe replace all the random pixels with another big grey=\r\nish-bluish block.  If you did not know beforehand what the original picture=\r\n was, you couldn&#39;t tell whether your pixelized image was really a field of =\r\nflowers, a chevy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.\n\n      =\r\n                      It works the same with the sound files.  Taking somet=\r\nhing as complex as speech, and replacing frequencies with their averages, l=\r\noses the speech the farther you go, until you head strange fluctuating squa=\r\nre waves.  Doing the same to random static will eventually produce the same=\r\n thing.  And random fluctuating square waves can sound a bit like speech - =\r\nor at least, you could have fun sharing with each other what you thing they=\r\n &#39;sound like&#39;.\n\n\n\n\n\n                            --- On Sun, 5/10/09, Misty =\r\nDawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n                              From: =\r\nMisty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt;\n                              Subject: =\r\nRe: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n                              To: EVP-IT=\r\nC@yahoogroups .com\n                              Date: Sunday, May 10, 2009=\r\n, 9:29 AM\n\n\n                                I always save the whole file in=\r\n wav format then do my clips as mp3.

For example, if I had a \n                  prog=\r\nram in some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it could \n               =\r\n   compress it.&nbsp; But if it lost even one bit, the resulting \n         =\r\n         exe file would not execute again after it was uncompressed on \n   =\r\n               the other side.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This kind of compression does things =\r\n\n                  like looking for common patterns in the file, and replac=\r\ning \n                  them with a token.&nbsp; A rough example would be if=\r\n it found \n                  &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot; in a file 20 times, it could =\r\nreplace all the \n                  occurances with say $HN1.&nbsp; And also=\r\n write a little \n                  dictionary in there someplace that says =\r\n&quot;$HN1=3DHowdy \n                  Neighbor&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When the file gets to it=\r\ns destination it can \n                  be uncompressed, and all occurences=\r\n of $HN1 are replaced with \n                  &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot;.&nbsp; So it=\r\n was compressed (instead of 14 \n                  characters each, it only =\r\nneeded 4, plus the dictionary), but \n                  lost no data.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not \n                  lossless.&nbsp=\r\n; Depending on the level of compression, some \n                  level of d=\r\nata is lost, and so cannot be recovered or \n                  reconstructed=\r\n later.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rick&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Sun, \n                  5/10/0=\r\n9, April Abercrombie &lt;I&gt;&lt;april@abercrombiegh \n                  ostresea=\r\nrch. com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;

You would see a lot of colored \n                        =\r\n    blocks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Or in the other direction, imagine \n                    =\r\n        you are looking at a competely randomize bunch of \n                =\r\n            pixes on your screen: a complete screen of truely \n            =\r\n                random static snow.&nbsp; Pixelizing this, after a \n       =\r\n                     while, you would again start to see colored \n         =\r\n                   blocks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What&#39;s happening is that it is \n         =\r\n                   processing an area of the image, taking (for \n          =\r\n                  instance) the average value of that entire area, and \n   =\r\n                         replacing all the blocks in that area with the \n  =\r\n                          average.&nbsp;

In the \n                            noise example, it maybe replace all t=\r\nhe random \n                            pixels with another big greyish-blui=\r\nsh block.&nbsp; \n                            If you did not know beforehand=\r\n what the original \n                            picture was, you couldn&#39;t t=\r\nell whether your \n                            pixelized image was really a =\r\nfield of flowers, a \n                            chevy, the sky with clouds=\r\n, or a random bunch of \n                            pixels.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It works=\r\n the same with the sound \n                            files.&nbsp; Taking s=\r\nomething as complex as speech, \n                            and replacing f=\r\nrequencies with their averages, loses \n                            the spee=\r\nch the farther you go, until you head \n                            strange =\r\nfluctuating square waves.&nbsp;
