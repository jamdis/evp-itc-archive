I also have the RS Hack, and\nit works quite well, and certainly provides an economical alternative\nto people.\n\nFor the record, I have no vested interest in Mini-boxes, the hacks or\nany ITC devices.  I have stated opinions about the Mini and it&#39;s\nadvantages, and it&#39;s OK to have those used as testimonials. I am using\na variety of devices in my work, and they are all valuable to me.  I\ntravel a lot, so the Mini and the RSH will be the devices of choice,\nespecially since they are more portable and less fragile than the FBs. \n\nRegards\nRosemary\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sam_stout&quot; &lt;sam_stout@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m new to this group, but not to ITC research. I&#39;m familiar with\n&gt; spirit communications using boxes like Frank&#39;s, the mini-box, and RS\n&gt; hack. I&#39;ve seen the picture of Frank with the mini-box. Frank, it\n&gt; looks to me that you are promoting this mini-box. Is that correct? If\n&gt; so, is it the only box that you are promoting now? Or are they just\n&gt; using your image and a few of your statements to push their box? What\n&gt; I heard of the C2C show it seemed to me that it was more of a\n&gt; promotion for the mini-box. They posted something about that their box\n&gt; has a cleaner signal and Frank&#39;s box had more noise to it. Well,\n&gt; sometimes in this line of work you want to have a little bit of\n&gt; inherent noise. I know that the RS radio has to meet FCC Class B\n&gt; regulations Part 15. As for being a cleaner signal, I would think that\n&gt; the RS radio would actually be, than the mini-box. I have heard both\n&gt; the mini-box and the RS hack and I can&#39;t tell a lot of differences\n&gt; between the two except for the price. It&#39;s my understanding that the\n&gt; mini-box is selling around $400 and that&#39;s a lot of money for just a\n&gt; AM radio. The RS radio is selling for $24.95 and I know people are\n&gt; getting some great results with the RS hack. Just my two cents worth!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Sam\n&gt;"}
