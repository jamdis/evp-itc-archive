It&#39;s not &quot;the box&quot;, it is supplying a *raw audio* that the\nentities use to form voices. *Raw audio==bits of speech.* There are in fact\nother methods that result in clearer communication. Even white noise, while\nproducing weak voices, it&#39;s still clearer voices. Another method, perhaps my\nfavorite is the Foreign language method, tuning in a foreign shortwave\nbroadcast in a language I don&#39;t understand, and after announcing I&#39;m doing\nan EVP recording, record directly for the radio&#39;s speaker. There is tuning\nan AM radio between stations when there are skip conditions, distant\nstations fading in and out randomly.\n\n Radio seems to be an important element in these communications, but the\nfact is, &quot;the box&quot; is not the only way. With using EVPmaker, the radio is\neliminated, so the importance of the radio element is debatable. You can do\nthe foreign language method via the Internet, see coffeepotghost.com\n\n You can use &quot;crowd noise&quot;, like recording in a shopping mall, or\nrestaurant, try to say, or at least think &quot; I&#39;m doing an EVP recording&quot;, you\nget meaningful messages made out of the  mix of normal voices.\n\n I use &quot;the box&quot; simply because is it convinient, not because it is the best\nmethod. Sweeping a radio is a quick, and easy way to produce *raw audio*.\nTen years I try to get this across, might as well tell it to my dogs!\n\nF-S\n\nOn Mon, Aug 1, 2011 at 6:12 AM, Richard B Georgina &lt;wd4rbx@bellsouth.net&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; **\n&gt; In my opinion there are a hand full of inventers that have achieved fame in\n&gt; the GB field. As I understand it they all are riding on the coat tales of\n&gt; our very own Frank S. Every GB out there is a spin on a Franks box even the\n&gt; ones that use a speech chip. The bottom line is that all the box&#39;s out there\n&gt; rely on snippets of speech that the spirit world can try and use to\n&gt; communicate with us. If you think about it there all spun up Frank&#39;s Box&#39;s.\n&gt; What I&#39;m getting at is that Frank has the fame market cornered and right\n&gt; fully so. Unless you are some sort of a wiz bang electrical engineer you\n&gt; might as well forget about becoming famous building GB&#39;s.\n&gt;\n&gt; The whole idea of using kit 23 (function generator) to sweep a radio and\n&gt; make a Frank&#39;s box knock off was to bring an inexpensive GB to the group\n&gt; that would work better then a hack and not earn a merit badge in GB\n&gt; building. At the time it was a good idea because this group was all about\n&gt; the communication . It was extremely interesting and it looked like this\n&gt; group just might take GBC to some level of understanding and even\n&gt; consistency in the communication. If someone wants to achieve fame through\n&gt; the GB community I believe that&#39;s the direction to go in. I doubt that you\n&gt; will have any compition and get lots of help from this group.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rich\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Money and fame are the two evils that plague the field.&lt;&lt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\nNo one ge s i !
