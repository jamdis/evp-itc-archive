It then occurred to me that I was being skeptical of something\nthat I have never sat down and tried. Not having much money, I went\nwith the shack hack method. My first session was phenomenal, and\nalthough I don&#39;t know how mystery voices can accurately and\ncontextually answer my questions posed to what is, in effect, a\nmalfunctioning radio, I am only left with the knowledge that it works.\nAt least it worked for me. Believe me, it drives me insane trying to\nfigure out the mechanism by which spirits would be able to communicate\nwith a box spitting out chunks of broadcast fragments. That being\nsaid, though, it really isn&#39;t anymore of a leap of faith than the\ncoil-induction theory of evp collection, I mean, how would a spirit\nknow how to manipulate focused emf fields to produce corresponding\nfrequency. \n\nAs to what the voices might be, I have to say as far as I am\nconcerned, the jury is still out. I am wondering if there isn&#39;t some\nsort of latent PK element in play by the operator, it would certainly\nexplain why the information is so accurate and specific. I am working\non a &quot;blind&quot; test to study that to my own satisfaction. The phenomenon\nmay very well be external entities trying to make contact, and if so,\nthat is just as cool. Either way, having thought the concept was\nabsurd at one time, I simply gave it a shot and the results were\nundeniable. Honestly, subsequent attempts at ITC with the shack hack\nhave produced mixed results, none with the in-your-face accuracy of\nthe first time. Suffice it to say it is dissapointing I cannot have\nthat kind of success every time, but I can certainly say that there is\n a force at work here and my curiosity is understandibly aroused.\n\nthanks\nAndy\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;maggotfurcoats&quot; &lt;katkat23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; But, are there any files on this group where any of you believe you\n&gt; are communicating with a spirit?  Frank&#39;s box seems to really force\n&gt; all kinds of &quot;voices&quot; out of the airwaves and I am not yet buying it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does any one have anything constructive to say to us in regard to\n&gt; actual paranormal investigation via Frank&#39;s box, rather than mildly\n&gt; entertaining techno-tweaking? \n&gt; \n&gt; I was on a multi-group investigation at an old historical mission in\n&gt; Santa Barbara a week ago, for instance and watched the frank&#39;s box at\n&gt; work for the first time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sure, I heard a few things that sounded obviously like radio, but we\n&gt; did hear a very eerie woman&#39;s voice screaming when we were in the main\n&gt; chapel room, and THAT got my attention..  But everything else I have\n&gt; heard so far in the files here is not striking me as the voice of any\n&gt; apparition, due to the weakness of quality. \n&gt; \n&gt; If you&#39;re still reading this, I have to tell you I have had striking\n&gt; results in my own home, simply letting a recording device roll, and if\n&gt; you&#39;re not yet interested in hearing these samples, I guess you&#39;re\n&gt; more into the box than the afterlife and that&#39;s YOU, not me! :)\n&gt; \n&gt; LOVE,\n&gt; \n&gt; Katherine.\n&gt;"}
