The Nine-Oh(90) file\nwas with about a four foot wire antenna. I&#39;ve impressed myself tonight.  I\ndon&#39;t have enough parts for the audio section, but able to make the preamp\nand sweep circuit. The tuner is a Nissan car stereo tuner--removed from the\nradio. I wanted to see how the car tuner worked with an RF amp on the front\nend.\n\n On the end of last FM, &quot;Ursula is miserable&quot;\n\n Frank-S\n\nWEllll, ound ha wi h a longe an enna, and he RF amp, I ge mos ly noise, so I sho ened he an enna o abou 12 inches.
