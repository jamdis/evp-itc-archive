<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, I thought Radio Shack offered some power antenna boosters, 
definitely for FM and maybe even AM.  In this case, I think FM is 
what&#x27;ll plug into your RS radio.  I didn&#x27;t know it would only work 
for one channel...hhhmmm.

Here is a Radio Shack item # to pop into their search box:
15-1859 (not sure if this will work or not)

The other idea would be to buy a very long length of antenna wire and 
add a male plug to the end of it that fits into the radio (1/8th).  I 
would be screwing it into something big and made of metal!  That may 
not make it too mobile, but you have to find some audio bits out 
there somewhere to start... ;)

&gt; Yes LC, I bought a select a tenna but it must be set for one 
channel and I think it is only for a.m.  I have tested it but don&#x27;t 
notice a difference.  I have seen some of the homemade coil deals on 
the web...can&#x27;t do that.  Any ideas, let me know.  Ron

boosted Am or FM antenna? ;)

&gt; &gt; Just found this about your new box. Looks and sounds promising. 
&gt; But I suppose in my Land-of-Weak-Signals I would get nothing. On 
the 
&gt; other hand, I almost feel I would sacrafice a volume of sessions 
and 
&gt; signals for good, clear, multi-word messages. I am getting EVP 
block 
&gt; because I am afraid I will get nothing during a session or, worse 
&gt; yet, I may be getting messages but I cannot hear or understand 
&gt; them...if you get my drift. Good stuff at your end. Ron L

&gt; &gt; I am testing that scans to strong signals only on the FM band, 
with 
&gt; &gt; scan rate and range adjustments. This method is different 
sounding, 
&gt; &gt; being somewhat choppy, but may yield clearer audio. The downside, 
&gt; as I 
&gt; &gt; have been discussing elsewhere, may be the lack of weaker signals 
&gt; &gt; between, and less white noise to be utilized. I&#x27;ll keep working 
&gt; with 
&gt; &gt; it and post my results as I have them. If spirits can manipulate 
&gt; &gt; audio, then this method may have merit, too. ;)
