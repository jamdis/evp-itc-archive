Frank,
 
I think it would be better if whatever amount of tones where being=
 used, 
instead of in sequence they where combined to make one harmonic ton=
e 
then the entity that was forming the words could manipulate the various =
tones in the 
signal and to us it would sound like one smooth continuous vo=
ice. just an idea.

Thanks=

nfortunately I'm not much of an engineer so I've been picking up books to h=

practicality of them (ie- creating random white noise to allow EVPs to be f=

sensitive' or whatever. But besides that, early on I was fascinated by seem=
ingly coherant sounds that would come out of random noise on my clock radio=
 in my bedroom as a kid, from what sounded like voices (thought I was crazy=
 for a while) to even morse code - for a long time one of my radios would p=

 suggested it was morse code, so I studied morse code and discovered that a=
t least some of it could be morse letters...usually they would spell one wo=
rd and then gibberish.Anyways, once I learned what EVP was I began messing =
around with recorders etc. My first clear recording came from using EVP mak=
er and was someone saying 'we have been waiting for you.' A few days later,=
 after a frustrating lack of communication they just told me 'build a box.(=
this happened to be after I learned of frank.)' I've been looking at all th=
