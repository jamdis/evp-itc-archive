I am wondering, has anyone here ever gotten an entity through the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; box who mentions &quot;rules&quot; for speaking to the living, and if so, what were\n&gt; &gt;&gt; those rules? I seem to vaguely recall mention of this somewhere, but can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;&gt; recall where. Wondering if the rules are laws of physics, or laws\n&gt; &gt;&gt; enforceable by (insert deity name here).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Frank, stop reading, because the next part assumes a belief in ghosts.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Well that&#39;s rude!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Reason I ask is, I was watching one of the better ghost shows on TV, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; it got me to thinking about how paranormal activity often happens in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; next room, almost never directly (unless it&#39;s a deceased loved one, or a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; residual haunting). Could this be because of those &quot;rules&quot;? Could the reason\n&gt; &gt;&gt; entities lie so much have to do with the &quot;rules&quot;?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thinking out loud here, so just ignore if I&#39;m not making any sense.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
