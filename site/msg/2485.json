I was wondering over the weekend if I&#39;ve  \n&gt; spent enough time on this. The boxes produce little that anyone  \n&gt; seems to hear, and if it&#39;s too clear, I&#39;m sure some, or maybe many  \n&gt; don&#39;t believe it. I guess it has to be that whispery s--- that you  \n&gt; have to filter into oblivion to be a &quot;true&quot; EVP, and I think that&#39;s  \n&gt; what most are listening for, it has to fit the paradigm of current  \n&gt; ghost hunting knowledge, or it&#39;s rejected. I&#39;ve reached a point  \n&gt; where I&#39;m tired of working on something that seems so pointless.  \n&gt; What if what I hear think I hear is only my own mis-perceptions!?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Boo!
