<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Anna

Welcome to the group. Good luck on building your box. I guess the 
first easiest place to direct you would be Mike Coletta&#x27;s website. He 
has posted alot of DIY how-to videos for newbies on how to modify a 
radio yourself to work similar to Franks boxes. His youtube page has 
most of that stuff but his websites interesting to keep up with as 
well =)

(Thanks for posting those again Mike)

While your on youtube you may want to check out some other peoples 
videos on how to modify an existing radio. Franks modified a number 
of different types as have others like Steve Hultay. Steve posted a 
list of the ones he&#x27;s been able to modify. Usually it requires 
nothing more than snipping  the mute wire. The archives on this group 
are a wealth of information just use the keyword search.

You also may want to try out manual sweep Most people find that 
brings in very good results. For manual sweep you are just sweeping 
the band. I prefer to use a radio with a knob dial. Then just start 
turning it back and forth across the band quickly so it doesnt have 
quite enough time to tune in any one radio station.

I also have had quite a bit of success using a dead zone spot in 
between any stations so that its set to off station and all I hear 
live is the radios static/whir. I have posted examples of some of 
these methods off my website.

Good luck on your quest!

&gt; Hi Everyone!
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m new and I stumbled onto this group after doing some research
&gt; online into EVP.  I consider myself to be a paranormal skeptic, but 
I
&gt; have heard some very interesting EVP evidence and would like to look
&gt; into it further.  I joined this group because I am interested in
&gt; submitting EVP data to some rigorous scientific analysis.  I&#x27;m an
&gt; electrical engineer and mainly work in the areas of signal 
processing
&gt; and communications so all of this is extremely interesting.  
&gt; 
&gt; I am interested in collecting some of my own data (at some point) by
&gt; building a ghost box based on Frank Sumption&#x27;s designs.  I am 
working
&gt; from the &quot;Ghost Box Notebook&quot; from 2007, but I am having a hard time
&gt; getting started.  Has anyone built one of these and are there any
&gt; parts lists or more complete schematics floating around? I would
&gt; appreciate any build help or advice any of you might have.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Anna
