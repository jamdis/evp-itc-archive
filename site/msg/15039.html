April, standard physics today defines four fundamental types of forces: ele=
ctromagnetism, gravity,=A0 and the strong and weak interaction of elementar=
y particles.=A0 So while EM is one type of energy (well, lets call it a for=
ce), there are a few others too.

        Tell me where the seperation o=
n the spectrum takes place between 
        300Hz and 300KHz. Yes, soundwav=
es cause pressure waves that our ears 
        read as vibration and our mi=
nd translates as sound. The waves are still 
        on the electromagnetic=
 spectrum. Even subsonic geomagnetic waves are 
        present on the scal=
e. What I mean by power can be directll translated to 
        volume or am=
plitude. The only thing that distinguishes soundwaves from 
        any oth=
er wave is the fact that we can hear them.

ound waves and electromagnetic waves. 
                        The only thi=
ng that seperates them is frequency and 
                        power. Rad=
io waves are radio waves because they occupy a

                =
        much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic waves can

                        <div>Think of microwaves. These are also a=
 type of radio

 the waves also have 
                        a physical effect on our envi=
ronment by causing 
                        molecules to speed up, which cr=

but usually it just causes
