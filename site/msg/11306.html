<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I know, I was concerned too, but decided that maybe it&#x27;s not up to me 
to say how this stuff is being used. To me, Moon is out there using the 
boxes in public, and that&#x27;s how many find out about it, so he might as 
well have better stuff.

&gt; I am concerend because Chris Moon is using Frank&#x27;s box under his name 
to make money.  He 
&gt; charges $250 for a half hour session with this box.  I wouldn&#x27;t be so 
irritated had he just 
&gt; called it something else, but this is Frank&#x27;s and it should be up to 
Frank how this box is used.  
&gt; I think using it to make money is wrong.  I am not saying it would be 
wrong for Frank to 
&gt; market it it, at a reasonable price, but to charge $250 for a session 
that is under the 
&gt; interpretation of Chris Moon is just playing on those who are 
suffering from a loss and 
&gt; looking for a connection.
