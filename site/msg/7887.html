<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The concept behind them is useful. The theory behind chaos being the
natural order of the universe is how I am comfortable with random
audio fragments being manipulated and messages delivered in them. Sort
of like why EVP Maker may work, or the Global Consciousness Project
delivering data associated with world emotion may work. For me
triskelion fulgerites would be interesting to study but I wouldn&#x27;t
have the skills to incorporate them into any electronics gear but may
find them inspiring to study.

&gt; Dear Sirs, triskelion fulgerites are spheres of fused glass with three
&gt; trilatereal roots, formed when lightning bolts hit the sands of the
&gt; beaches of Florida, where there are more lightning strikes than anywhere
&gt; else on Earth. You should experiment with these items, incorporate them
&gt; into your EVP gear, play around with the + and - and ground electrical
&gt; links on its roots, and see if these items can be utilized as both
&gt; antenna or a microphone voice transmission diodes, to see if it will
&gt; enable you to talk to ghosts CLEARLY. These items are pieces oc chaos
&gt; theory made manifest, and only the massive energy of a thunderbolt
&gt; grounding itself can create them. They cannot be made in the lab. That
&gt; covers it.
