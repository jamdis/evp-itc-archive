  Yes like a magnet for them. P=

my reply is usually its more like when did "they" become interested in me.

  We'd love to hear your evp you get during your experiment. I checked my =
files and tho there are many hello's said many different ways I have never =
had a "yes hello" to my knowledge.

  As for the itc pics, I guess some cou=
ld be considered "scary" LOL but I have never had any fear about any of thi=
s. I've dealt with the paranormal so long that to me its just normal. Tho w=
hen I first started the itc pics I would get hundreds of eyes staring back =
at me, it was a bit creepy. Then during evp they mentioned the pics and sai=
d "echo six is ready we have to look happy to you" so I did more itc and go=
t alot of smiles and teeth. Creepier LOL. In later evp someone said "I told=
 you were looking happy".

  They have also shown me pics/artwork of the "l=
iving". 

  I find it all quite fascinating.
