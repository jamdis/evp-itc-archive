Frank:=A0 Ran the test here in Campeche, Mexico with your audio clip.=A0 I=
 have no radio here to speak of so evpmaker has been my sole source of EVP =
testing.=A0 Until now, that is.
=A0
I need help here.=A0 When I listened to=
 your clip real time I did not here the segment attached.=A0 In my editor I=
 picked out a voice that sounded differerent than the other sounds on your =
clip.=A0 What I hear in the attached is DIFFERENT PEOPLE.=A0 An interesting=
 comment since I certainly would be a DIFFERENT PERSON having sent your cli=
p to Mexico to play and test.=A0 Hopefully we finally have figure out a way=
 to confuse them on the other side.=A0=A0 If RJ and others can confirm what=
 they hear or don't hear on my tape and your original and give their opinio=
n...that would be great.=A0 
=A0
What would be even greater is if others co=
uld run the same test.=A0 All I did was play your radio clip and trhough my=
 computer speakers while recording on Goldwave editor.=A0 Listen and then p=
