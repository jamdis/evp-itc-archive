<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

I recently had someone write me stating he was &quot;The worlds foremost expert in ghost box technology.&quot; I was like, &quot;What the hell?&quot; 

Just my thoughts on a lazy Carolina Saturday night.

&gt;  This is the box I gave to the Septic crackheads for full debunking. They
&gt; claim they have &quot;an expert&quot; to analyze it, but I think everyone realizes
&gt; they have no one honest to test the box, they just want it to go away. Which
&gt; means many get verifiable information through the box and &quot;science&quot; doesn&#x27;t
&gt; like it. How can the box work when they know there are no spirits, and since
&gt; it works, they are wrong and they just can&#x27;t *be* wrong!
&gt; 
&gt;  I subscribe to the skeptic newsletter, it&#x27;s a way to see what&#x27;s out there
&gt; for alternative science. Generally, if something works, the skepdicks are
&gt; all over it.
