My Dad used to always call me &quot;Stevie&quot; so that might be him, could\n&gt; &gt; also be wishful thinking i suppose.  But the help file is very clear.  My\n&gt; &gt; Dad passed away last November, my guys keep telling me that he is helping\n&gt; &gt; over there.  I hope that it&#39;s true, but i&#39;m sure nobody will hear these\n&gt; &gt; except maybe Frank.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *Steve Hultay\n&gt; &gt; *www.keyportparanormal.com*\n&gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/\n&gt; &gt; www.stevehultay.com\n&gt; &gt; www.rtscresearch.org*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
