Well, RJ do=

like a mo=

Thanks again for everyone who part=

motivation to try different methods, =
see what works, and  try to improve 
everyone's understanding of EVP-ITC.

=
If you  recall, on 7/10/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer  
mon=
itor, right in front of me, and left it there until today,  7/14/2010, noon=
 
Denver time. The experiment was for participants to  determine what it wa=
s. 
Vague or partial answers wouldn't be counted  (for example, just colors=
, 
shapes, sizes, what it's made of, etc):  we're looking for what it is. 
=
Participants could use their ghost  boxes, EVP recorders, or I suppose any =
other 
means they  chose.

In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of =
the  object at the start of 
the experiment and loaded it to the Files  sec=
tion (RJ folder) of this 
group. If you can follow the link, it is  here:

=
_http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/  EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710. 
1.z=
ip_ (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip)=
 

The idea was that  you could download the file at the beginning of the 
=
test, and 'keep  it safe' on your computer. Then at the end of the test, I =
would 
 release the password so you could reveal the contents of the file. =
 That 
way, you were in control of the original image during the  entire te=
st, not 
me. 

The password for that file is:  123BlastOff
Instructions, if=
 you need them, are also in that RJ  folder.

And if you did not care to do=
wnload the zip file  before the test, I will 
post the final image there to=
o.

So to  the results:

Number of participants: 5
Total tries:  8
Ambiguou=
s answers: 0
Correct answers: 0

Object: A  radio
Uzipped picture:
_http://=
tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/  EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710. 
1.JPG_ (htt=
p://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG) 

So wh=
at do the  results mean? All that we can really agree on from this 
experim=
ent  is that no participant, with whatever theories or methods or  
technol=
ogy they used, was able to correctly determine the object. We  can't say 
t=
hose theories or methods or technologies never work. Just  as we can't say =

they do. Just that, for whatever reason, they did  not work this time. 
Re=
aders can take the results, use them to  improve or change their methods, o=
r 
keep doing what they're  doing.

If anyone has any observations, comment=
s, or ideas for  improvement, let me 
know. I hope to get a new experiment =
up and  running soon. Since there 
wasn't much participation Mon-Wed, I thi=
nk  the next experiment will be arranged 
to mostly span the  weekends.

Ag=
ain, thanks to everyone who participated in this  first experiment.
