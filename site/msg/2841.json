Is there such a thing, are we talking about \nthe field that has ideas and theories and no solid evidence of \nanything to back it up?  It&#39;s like being an expert at something that \nyou can&#39;t prove exists in the first place.  We would have a better \nshot of being an expert at picking the winning lottery numbers than \nproving to someone that an afterlife exists.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yeah, he&#39;s got the grumpy attitude!

I can&#39;t get past that shit, \nnor can I get past the egos, so I give up, they can&#39;t hear me. &gt; &gt; I \nthink the problem is intellect, it takes a certain level to be able \nto comprehend, and use the boxes, to everyone else its&#39; going to \nlook fake, and sound like gibberish. &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-\nITC@: lisby@: Thu, 8 Nov 2007 20:29:08 -0500Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] \nYou tube?&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You don&#39;t scare me.

It&#39;s my first attempt, so I&#39;m not sure if it worked, \nand it&#39;s blocked here at work. BTW, I&#39;m not sure if the Purple \nPrincess stuff puts people off, that&#39;s who my guys say I am, and I \naccept that as an axiom. As if it matters, but that&#39;s an &quot;other \nlevel&quot; identity, and has little to do with physical conditions. \nPurple is a treacher, that&#39;s all, I just happen to be a very poor \nteacher.
