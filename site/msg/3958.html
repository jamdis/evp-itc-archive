Anne, I was wondering if you or the others could shed some light on validations received.  I have been conducting conventional EVP for sometime now and have utilized it for many areas.  I believe that (and this is only my theory) that you can capture EVP anywhere using just a regular recorder.  In doing historical research on the answers provided by the other side, I have in some cases been able to validate the responses given using the conventional method, backing it up with periodicals.   Since I have only conducted 2 test sessions with the hacked, I was curious as to those have been doing this for a while been able to confirm some of responses received?  I know Bruce confirmed that the other side knew what they where doing by cleaning out his daughters room, but I was curious as to historical facts or things of importance.
   
  The reason why I am asking is the first 2 sessions I asked direct questions pertaining to reports I had which was confirmed and never expected to received the responses I did in detail knowing that they were in fact true.  Have you or anyone ran any experiments in their sessions to see if they are consistent in proving facts or predictions that have come true?

          Hey Ann,

I'm totally on the same page about finding out the truth, whatever it 
may be. I know there are tricksters. Native Americans call them 
Coyote or Skinwalkers. 

From the clear voices and degree of two-way dialog, for me it's 
simply about getting straight answers. I'm planning to try and be 
rigorous about testing any spirits or whatever they are before 
proceeding. The last thing I wish to do is entertain some demon or 
entity that is all about lying and half-truths.
