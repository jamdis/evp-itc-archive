That could be a possibility for some, but not for me. I am about as 
psychic as an old tree trunk. For over a year and a half I stumbled 
around various locations with my trusted crummy microcassette 
recorder trying to record an EVP. Then, on my last certification 
training investigation something dropped in front of me and rolled 
across the floor in total darkness in a very old building,---  It 
nearly soiled my shorts!

I recorded my first EVP at that location that night. But it was a 
grade C crummy one.

It was not until I began to use a multi-digital recorder system that 
I began to get a great deal of EVP&#x27;s. I utilze 11 of them now on a 
typical home investigation. I have noticed a link between EMF fields 
and EVP gathering in the cases I have been involved in as well.

I speak very loudly when performing an intereactive EVP session. 
This might be a factor since I have recorded most of our EVP&#x27;s in 
our investigative group. But who knows? I am not developed 
psychically though. I did have an experience at Waverly Hills in 
Kentucky three weeks ago on an investigation. Our team had recorded 
numerous EVP&#x27;s by the infamous Room 502. We are still analyzing 
them. I walked into this very dark room at about 04:00 hours on the 
3rd floor. Two team members were about 10 feet behind me talking. 
The hair on the back of my neck stood up. I took out my digital 
recorder and got a moaning evp from it after I asked it&#x27;s name.

Psychic? Or just plain luck?

&gt; One of the reasons I believe the researcher is often part of the
&gt; process is because some investigators seem to be able to 
consistently
&gt; obtain evp&#x27;s while others are not, despite many attempts over 
years of
&gt; investigating. Sometimes the teams in CA refer to those who often 
get
&gt; decent results as &quot;evp magnets&quot;. 
&gt; 
&gt; I think the individuals who can easily obtain good results (no 
matter
&gt; where they are) may be able to channel their psychic abilities 
into PK
&gt; energy and record the results as an evp. I&#x27;m not suggesting this is
&gt; what happens every time but it may be what&#x27;s happening in some of 
the
&gt; cases.

&gt; &gt; Hi Tracy,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you study human agent poltergeist cases of psychokinesis, the 
&gt; &gt; identified human agent is always in the house of structure when 
the 
&gt; &gt; objects move.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The famous Miami Hotel case that Dr. William Roll investigated 
is a 
&gt; &gt; great example. When a certain kitchen worker was present, all 
sorts 
&gt; &gt; of objects were thrown around the room. When he was not there, 
&gt; &gt; nothing happened. When he left the Hotel for good, no more 
activity 
&gt; &gt; was ever recorded.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would like to try to rule out, or, support the theory that we 
are 
&gt; &gt; not, or that we might be imprinting EVP&#x27;s on audio tracks or 
tape.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My own personal experience in EVP gathering leads me to believe 
that 
&gt; &gt; this is phenomena driven, not my subconscious mind.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But now I have to try and find out the truth for myself.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This last year we saw an incredible amount of EVP&#x27;s being 
recorded 
&gt; &gt; during our cases we investigated.

&gt; &gt; The above is our link to our new EVP gallery if you would like 
to 
&gt; &gt; listen to them. These were all recorded in the last year using  
&gt; &gt; multiple recorders in each location. There is a Grade A and a 
Grade 
&gt; &gt; B icon to seperate them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not sure this would still rule it out.  I don&#x27;t think 
&gt; &gt; psychokinesis is restrained by walls, the mind isn&#x27;t restrained 
by 
&gt; &gt; walls whether human or deceased.  I am guessing that 
psychokinesis 
&gt; &gt; behaves similar to telepathy....
&gt; &gt; &gt;    
&gt; &gt; &gt;   I believe many evp&#x27;s are deceased spirits, but the question 
on 
&gt; &gt; whether it could be a living person imprinting the evps was 
&gt; &gt; certainly one that made me really think !

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Back when I still investigated haunted sites, our team did 
this on 
&gt; &gt; various occasions within a house where we recorded several hours 
of 
&gt; &gt; activity over a few years (a long term investigation). We would 
&gt; &gt; leave our audio equipment recording in several &quot;hot spots&quot; all 
over 
&gt; &gt; the house and then leave for an hour or two. I have to say, in 
our 
&gt; &gt; experience we never got an EVP while we were out of the house. 
As a 
&gt; &gt; matter of fact we had an EVP when we reentered the house 
&gt; &gt; saying, &quot;here they come, lets go&quot;. I don&#x27;t necessarily 
understand 
&gt; &gt; why a ghost or spirit would talk with no one present to receive 
the 
&gt; &gt; message unless during setup you explained what you are trying to 
&gt; &gt; accomplish and what the spirits roll is in the experiment (we 
never 
&gt; &gt; tried explaining). A piece of machinery (recorders) in an empty 
room 
&gt; &gt; does not have a consciousness or spiritual presence I would be 
&gt; &gt; interested to see if you get different results.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank

&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] EVP Experiment planned in October.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;     To try and rule out that the EVP researchers are 
imprinting 
&gt; &gt; voices 
&gt; &gt; &gt; psychokinetically on audio players mistaken as ghosts voices, 
I 
&gt; &gt; will 
&gt; &gt; &gt; pre-tape an interactive evp session.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I will record a bank of thirty questions, 20 seconds of 
silence 
&gt; &gt; &gt; after each question, on a cassete tape and played on a 
cassette 
&gt; &gt; &gt; player that will be utilized in all three buildings in a known 
&gt; &gt; &gt; haunted location just outside of Phoenix, Arizona.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; There will be digital recorders, cassette recorders, omni 
&gt; &gt; &gt; directional microphones, condensor microphones, as well as an 
&gt; &gt; &gt; electrocet boom microphone present in all of the sessions. 
There 
&gt; &gt; &gt; will be no human agents in the buildings when these sessions 
take 
&gt; &gt; &gt; place.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; My hope is to:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Record an authentic EVP with no human agent in the building. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; If this is phenomena driven, will the phenomena communicate by 
&gt; &gt; &gt; responding to questions from a machine rather than a human 
agent? 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you have any ideas to enhance this experiment, please feel 
free 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to let me know. This experiment will take place on October 
27th.
