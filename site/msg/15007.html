Here is some food for thought. I am currently reviewing my audio from our M=
ay 30th investigation.

It was me and another girl teammate present in the =
room. I picked up a 3rd female voice on my digital voice recorder that I ca=
rry with me. We were standing right next to another digital video recorder =
that I leave beside my night vision camera. That recorder did not pick up t=
his 3rd voice. I have asked the girl that was with me to check her recordin=
g to see if she picked it up.

I have long felt the true EVP does not come =
from sound waves in the environment, or then it wouldn't be EVP, but a dise=
mbodied voice. Somehow EVP's are appearing directly on the recordings.

Thi=
s instance with the recorders may back that theory up. That other recorder =
should have picked that voice up if it were sound waves in the environment.=


I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. The file that is named "01-02-=
17 Clip" is the full clip. You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah", and then=
 another comes in right after that. I think I know what it says.

Again, I =
was live monitoring my audio, but still did not hear this until playback. I=
t isn't clear, so I am not as excited about it as my one's from the last in=
vestigation.

        I have a running theory that EVP is carr=
ied on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to man=
ifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic wav=
es that differ one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them to=
gether you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a g=
host is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room cr=
eating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate d=
ifference frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz=
). This was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultraso=
nic signals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt that EV=
P were generated within a few inches of the recorder.

        We are able =
to reproduce this affect in not only radio with superheterodyne systems but=
 also with acoustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a commercial p=
roduce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.

          Fascinating! I've had this idea that th=
e EVP are often not recorded by the microphone but somehow make their way i=
n at the actual point where the storage is made, whether it be analog (tape=
) or digital. 

          So much we don't know ...
