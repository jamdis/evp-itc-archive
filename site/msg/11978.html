<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>What some on here are calling &quot;elementals&quot; I have seen myself, and
have seen captured on film personally once.

My niece while on vacation last year in FL, took a picture of our
cousins house. She took lots of other photos. Digital camera.  When
she got back home and started going through them, she just couldn&#x27;t
believe her eyes on this one.  Now, I saw it on the camera, still on
the media card myself. I know that my niece doesn&#x27;t have the computer
skills to photoshop this. To me, it appears that she caught a pic of a
fairy/sprite, or &quot;elemental&quot; of some kind.

It&#x27;s one of the most fascinating and intriguing pictures I&#x27;ve ever seen.
