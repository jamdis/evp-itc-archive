I think it works pretty \n&gt; well. But I LOVE the Mini-Box!&quot;\n&gt; -----\n&gt; \n&gt; Just thought I&#39;d share.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;April Slaughter&quot; &lt;aprilrebuilt@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am very excited for this! I think it will be a good, informative\n&gt; &gt; show. I was able to deliver the very first of the production\n&gt; &gt; mini-boxes to Rosemary this past Sunday while on the Queen Mary. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We spent time with all the different devices. The RadioShack Hack \nwas\n&gt; &gt; very surprising!! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; All of this technology is fantastic. So glad to see so many minds\n&gt; &gt; working out there to combine and create ideas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Have a great show Rosemary!!! :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
