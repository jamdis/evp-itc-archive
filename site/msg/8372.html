10	SECRET HELPERS
15	VALUE GOOD  
21	KRISTIN GOOD 
31	LOOK AT YOU GO 
36	THEY TEACH  
39	They teach?
42	SPIRIT IT IS ____ FUL SPIRIT
54	PLEASE JUST FORGET 
102	FORGET IT
112	PLEASE DON&#x27;T WORRY ABOUT THEM (IT)
119	SPIRIT FOR TRUTH TRUTH
130	GOOD LUCK  IN
133	INTERGALATICIAL
142     YOUR RIGHT

150	I dont understand this  - undescernable 
156	IT IS CLEAR (THAT YOU WERE..)
200	YES WE ARE DONE.</pre>
