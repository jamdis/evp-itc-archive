So you have had an NDE yourself?  I have never spoken to  a person that has experienced this.  I have heard about it and read stories about it.
   
  I have a question. Or many perhaps.
   
  My father passed away in 1987. Since I got my radio, I have been trying to contact him.
   
  Do they hear us, or how does that work? I mean, how would I get in touct with him to let him know I have this radio, and that I want him to come by when I play it?
   
  Do you have regular contacts that you speak with, and how did you get to that level of friendship?

                    Hmm Michael I will try to answer some of you questions. Depends on what religion you are is what you believe will happen when you die.  Yes there is a light that you go into to cross to the other side. As me having a near death yes you see your loved ones and you also see your pets. Yes you can see them in physical form. You will see them the way that you last remembered them. I don't know about the food and the wine.  Traveling the globe I feel you will be able to do if you wanted to. I suppose it would be the same for the moon and the planets and the oceans.  
   
  Our purpose is to help others and learn so we can take that to other lifetimes. That is my belief. If you want to reincarnate I don't know the process of that one I am sorry.  
   
  If you have any other questions I will try to answer them.
  Hugs

  Hi I am new to the group.  Now that you have your box, what type of questions have you asked?  Like, "What happens when we die? Where do we go? Is there a light? Do we meet with our loved ones, and can we see them in a physical form as we did when we were in our bodies, or do we just see light/energy and know it is them? After we see our loved ones, what happens next? Can we eat food there? Drink a nice glass of wine there? Enjoy a beer? Travel the globe and see all the tourist attractions on the planet? Can we travel and walk on the moon or other planets? Can we dive in the worlds oceans, and visit old shipwrecks? What is the purpose of our human life, and can we reincarnate again and how does that happen? I bet you are having a ball with that box. Please keep me in tuned to what you hear back.  Mike Edwards, Cary NC...
