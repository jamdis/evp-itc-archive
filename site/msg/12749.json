I think the draw t=\r\no the box for ghost hunters is that it &quot;appears&quot; to be a communication devi=\r\nce with the dead. I&#39;ve been experimenting a lot with the radio shack hack b=\r\nox and I have been getting a lot. For the most part I am using it to get an=\r\nswers to questions I or others have in areas that have had strange events o=\r\nr just a paranormal nature to them. There is definitely communication at a =\r\nrudimentary level although I doubt that all of it is honest communication. =\r\nI definitely see a lot of the trickster influence with these boxes. It can =\r\nand does tell people what they want to hear, and it seems to be reading the=\r\n minds of the participants. Like someone will crack a joke and the box will=\r\n respond 2 seconds later saying simply &quot;joke&quot;. I was using the box in one a=\r\nrea with a recently married woman and the word pregnant came out of the box=\r\n 3 times during the 2 sessions. I think the box was picking up on her consc=\r\nious or subconscious thoughts. I have not gotten the word pregnant since th=\r\nen. \n\nSo far both radio shack types I have are working spectacularly for me=\r\n. One of the more interesting responses I&#39;ve gotten out of the box is that =\r\nit has said &quot;ovulous&quot; backwards (it said &quot;75&quot; forwards), and that was just =\r\n10 minutes or so after I was playing around with the Ovilus. I don&#39;t know e=\r\nxactly how The Ovilus is supposed to be pronounced but the box pronounced i=\r\nt like I spelled it above.\n\nSo what is going on with these boxes is extreme=\r\nly interesting and not readily explainable by science, but I lean away from=\r\n thinking the communications are coming from ghosts or demons, I am thinkin=\r\ng it is just transferring thought into messages or it is higher beings answ=\r\nering our questions (although not always truthfully). I have to say I was h=\r\nighly skeptical that I would get anything with these type of boxes but I ha=\r\nve been fascinated by the results. I&#39;ve played what I am hearing for others=\r\n and have done sessions with others, and these people have all been impress=\r\ned too. Thanks for bringing this technology to the forefront like you have.=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Frank Sumption \n  To: Group \n =\r\n Sent: Wednesday, November 12, 2008 1:17 PM\n  Subject: [EVP-ITC] The latest=\r\n.\n\n\n   I know, doesn&#39;t fit the latest ghost hunting theories, and it has be=\r\nen poor at attracking the lime lights, but here it is. \n   \n   I have playe=\r\nd with the idea of adding in a tone to act as a foundation for the ghost vo=\r\nices in the boxes, it seems to works.the first example is on my site, http:=\r\n//purplealiengirl.tripod.com/ , noted which one it it there.
