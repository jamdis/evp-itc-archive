These are also =\r\na type of radio and telemetry transmitting wave but the waves also have a p=\r\nhysical effect on our environment by causing molecules to speed up, which c=\r\nreates heat. A little lower than this is IR or infrared it too can cause ph=\r\nysical objects to heat up but usually it just causes molecules to rotate in=\r\n place. All physical things give off IR light.

It wo=\r\nrks off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that diff=\r\ner one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them together you g=\r\net a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is send=\r\ning a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating an un=\r\ntrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate difference fr=\r\nequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz).

The only thing that \n                                seperates them =\r\nis frequency and power. Radio \n                                waves are ra=\r\ndio waves because they occupy a \n                                certain bl=\r\nock of the electromagnietic spectrum. \n                                Soun=\r\nd waves exist on that same spectrum just \n                                f=\r\narther down with much longer waves.

The shorter the \n                =\r\n                wavelength the more ways we can shield against \n           =\r\n                     them.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                                &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                                &lt;DIV&gt;Think of microwaves. These are=\r\n also a type \n                                of radio and telemetry transm=\r\nitting wave but the \n                                waves also have a phys=\r\nical effect on our \n                                environment by causing =\r\nmolecules to speed up, \n                                which creates heat.=\r\n A little lower than this is \n                                IR or infrare=\r\nd it too can cause physical objects \n                                to hea=\r\nt up but usually it just causes molecules \n                                =\r\nto rotate in place.

It works off the \n          =\r\n                      heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic \n    =\r\n                            waves that differ one another in frequency then=\r\n \n                                if you add or subtract them together you =\r\nget a \n                                beat frequency or alternate frequenc=\r\ny. For \n                                example, if a ghost is sending a si=\r\ngnal at 54KHz \n                                and you have an electric fan=\r\n in a room creating \n                                an untrasonic frequenc=\r\ny at 45KHz then you will \n                                have a intermedia=\r\nte difference&nbsp;frequency at \n                                9KHz, well=\r\n within human hearing range (20Hz to \n                                20KHz=\r\n). This was just an example, but all \n                                elect=\r\nronic equipment generates ultrasonic \n                                signa=\r\nls just by turning them on.
