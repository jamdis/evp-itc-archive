<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, wow.. I don&#x27;t know what to say.  I&#x27;ve belonged to the group for 3-4
days. Your reputation and experience/experiments were  the main reason and I
learned afterwards of the others with experience.  I can only apologize if
my question was the straw.  Thank you for explaining the history, Frank.
 Sorry it&#x27;s been so wearing on you.  Hope you find what you&#x27;re looking for.

&gt; Well, for one thing, I don&#x27;t own the group anymore. Due to one of these
&gt; incessent argurments, I had to back away from this some years ago as I
&gt; almost got fired becuase yet someone else that thought they knew so much
&gt; more forwarded all my e-mails to my boss.
&gt;
&gt; Then someone else seemed to be insinuating that I may have tampered with
&gt; the imgaes. Very insulting. This stuff goes on an on, regardless of the
&gt; quality of voices, or the images. I have reached my saturation point. There
&gt; seems to be nothing more to be gained by presenting anything else. Now, I
&gt; can sympatize with Richard Roberts!
&gt;
&gt; The group will continue, as there are a number of box and paranormal
&gt; experts here that are more than happy to tell everyone what this stuff
&gt; really is and how it works.
&gt;
&gt; I didn&#x27;t mean to create bad any feelings.

&gt; &gt; Hi
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank you for getting back to me. I thought I had destroyed the group by
&gt; accident. Awful feeling!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I completely understand and am very grateful that he started this group
&gt; and is willing to share and let share ideas and files. God forbid he should
&gt; leave!! I&#x27;m not used to looking at video this way so it would be easy for me
&gt; to miss a lot. I did see the Upside Down Lincoln and the face at the end in
&gt; the second attachment of &quot;If this is the only one...&quot; I need more practice
&gt; and a more open mind, I think. This is all so far reaching. Thank goodness
&gt; he, especially (and the others in this group) are doing this and sharing
&gt; these ideas. Kudos to Frank for all of his work!

&gt; anyone on what they where hearing but some on here does ALOT...its starting
&gt; to sound as if they feel like they knew more then anyone and most just
&gt; started doing this where..Frank,Steve and some other have been doing this
&gt; for years..Some even have the nerve to try to talk done to Frank..now
&gt; remember this is the man the made the box..so i just think its insulting and
&gt; ignorant. I for one will be really pissed of if they ran him from his own
&gt; group..

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes I did and I saw it. This is new to me and I&#x27;m here to learn so I

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m thinking there is faces embedded in sound, it&#x27;s related to
&gt; speech, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not just EVP. It seems to be a normal function of our own
&gt; minds(living or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dead), the same as reverse speech. I found some faces in old EVPs
&gt; from boxes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and also in music files. The ones from Evanescence are pretty
&gt; impressive in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person, and do not seem to be intentionaly embedded.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know, it&#x27;s not ghost hunters, and most don&#x27;t want to have to
&gt; think.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think most want this stuff in a neat little box, all well
&gt; defined, all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rules and protocols known, but it just won&#x27;t stay in one box, or
&gt; universe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for that matter.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think that I see what you mean. I mean no offense, but I it would
&gt; be helpful to see something a little more definitive that couldn&#x27;t be
&gt; mistaken for matrixing. Is this possible? Is it just me?
