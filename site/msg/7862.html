&gt; hacked it and it is ready to go.

Different people set their up different ways, but this is how I use it:

1.	Since it doesn&#x27;t have a built in speaker, you will need to get a
speaker for it.  Computer speakers work fine.  I use a small speaker
built for mp3 players that I picked up at Big Lots for $6.
2.	You need something to record the sessions into.  Some people use
digital recorders.  I record mine directly into my computer using a
freeware program called Audacity.  http://audacity.sourceforge.net/
via headphones that have a built in microphone
3.	I don&#x27;t have access to Audacity at the moment, but I think it&#x27;s
pretty self explanatory.  If you need further instructions on this,
I&#x27;ll look at the process when I get home.
4.	To do a session, set the Audacity to record.  Turn on your hack and
press the top part of the button on the front until it starts flipping
through the stations continuously.  You can let it go after that.
Hold the speaker a few inches from the microphone.  You can either ask
questions or allow the box to run on its own.  When you are finished,
review the recording to see if you pick up any communications through
it.


I hope that makes sense.
