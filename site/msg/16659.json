Asking questions is the most natural way to find out something from someone.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, Jan 25, 2010 at 10:56 AM, &lt;shipsdrummer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Just adding: thats exactly how it works. When we contact a spirit or see\n&gt; &gt; one they wont talk &quot;unless&quot; a question is asked. Then they will speak or\n&gt; &gt; send a picture or noise or whatever.\n&gt; &gt; Talking to spirits is a series of questions. One you notice that you have\n&gt; &gt; the ability, then people just look at it awhile, then it hits them to ask\n&gt; &gt; questions and then they find that the spirits answer things too. :) The box\n&gt; &gt; is a tool to bring the conversations on the outside of your head. Its a big\n&gt; &gt; deal. How did this first get thought of, Frank? How did Frank get the idea\n&gt; &gt; to ask it questions? That is what mediumship is all about.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My son has built one of the boxes. I am trying to get him on here because\n&gt; &gt; he will do the work for me of building them. I help a little from having 6\n&gt; &gt; months of electronics too. This is really going to go far. This is a brave\n&gt; &gt; new adventure and I am happy to be here.\n&gt; &gt; Thank you\n&gt; &gt; San\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tom_Ray@... writes:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well, I consider myself a &quot;Psychic&quot; too I use a &quot;monitor Technique not\n&gt; &gt; unlike the CIA was said to employ (I discovered it on my own and later read\n&gt; &gt; that the CIA was using a similar method) I use a &quot;monitor&quot; or person to ask\n&gt; &gt; questions and I find I can reply psychically It involves not using the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;questioning/judgemental&quot; part of my brain and staying in the &quot;declaritive\n&gt; &gt; mode&quot;--somehow THAT holds the psychic &quot;conduit&quot; open and I can function as a\n&gt; &gt; medium. The monitor person asks the questions and the replies come. Should I\n&gt; &gt; ask the question myself, however, the conduit shuts. It IS interesting\n&gt; &gt; though, I can ask questions indirectly, staying in declaritive mode, by\n&gt; &gt; saying to my monitor something like &quot;ask me to look at the flag or ask me\n&gt; &gt; what color is his coat---The monitor asks and THEN I get my answer--I stay\n&gt; &gt; concious, but with a slight &quot;buzz&quot; and often the info does not go to my long\n&gt; &gt; term mem ory.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My suggestions on how the boxes work are based on my own years of\n&gt; &gt; experience with random viewing fields. once it became obvious how THEY\n&gt; &gt; worked, it was a simple thing to see the correspondence with audio factor in\n&gt; &gt; boxes. One thing the boxes have taught me, however, is that it is NOT &quot;all\n&gt; &gt; in the head&quot; as these sound files can be shared with others.---This is\n&gt; &gt; making me rethink that my VIDEO random feild stuff may also not be &quot;in the\n&gt; &gt; head, and perhaps may be captured on imagery.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Frank Sumption\n&gt; &gt; &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You&#39;re making alot of presumptuous statements that have no basis in fact.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You&#39;re just jealous cuz you can&#39;t hear the boxes. I don&#39;t need any noise\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hear spirits, and I do just fine seeing through the third eye. It&#39;s just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that same old skeptic BS that it&#39;s all in the brain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; F-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Sat, Jan 23, 2010 at 6:54 PM, Tom &lt;Tom_Ray@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The random sounds make it easier to hear spirit voices in your head. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discovered this effect VISUALLY staining at rsndom dots on a viewing\n&gt; &gt; screen.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the visual mode the spirit only has to suppress the light spots and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enhance the dark spots that do not match the image it is\n&gt; &gt; sending----Light\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and dark spots on the screen that correspond to the image dont have to\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; modulated at all---the result is a SAVING of &quot;psychic energy&quot; on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observers part, perhaps not much, but enough to make the difference\n&gt; &gt; between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seeing and NOT seeing, however. Random sound would work the same way\n&gt; &gt; only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the frequencies that did not match the sounds being sent would have to\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blocked or replaced, the frequencies already present would NOT have to\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; modulated--so SOME energy is saved and not as much effort is needed to\n&gt; &gt; hear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the entity. Effectively enhancing one&#39;s innate abilities. It a lot\n&gt; &gt; easier to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hear a spirit sound if some of the waves are already in place, than it\n&gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be if you had to build the entire word from scratch.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;EVP-ITC%\n&gt; &gt; 40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Jill&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;jjkamp@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That doesn&#39;t surprise me at all.
