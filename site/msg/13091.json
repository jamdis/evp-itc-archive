This should\nbring into serious question any EVPs people have gotten, unless they\nknow those sensitivies beforehand.\n\n\nthat brings into --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, laurie@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; YES!\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; We have had cell phones set off our EMF meters.\n&gt; \n&gt; What made me ban the use of two way radios was when I noticed that\nthey were causing interference on the DVRs..\n&gt; \n&gt; they also cause humming and static on some audio recorders - as do\nsome cell phones.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; For large aeas like Gettysburg, ffort Mifflin, ESP, etc, what we do\nis map out the area ahead of time, with a scheduled rotation of small\ngroups.

This method assumes a level of\nresponsibility and respect on the part of the investigators - I have\nfound that if you are doing an event where others and the public are\ninvited it is essential to have them see the schedule and agree to\nabide by it when they sign up and then again when they arrive. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Laurie\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: &quot;Luis Gonzalez&quot; &lt;almovadar@...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, December 13, 2008 11:40pm\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Of Radio Interference and equipment...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tom, \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; I own a Motorola Razor.

I recieved a phone call that set off the EMF detector and\nit subsequently &quot;spiked&quot; from the color green to red and did so for\neach vibra signal the the phone was receiving... This false positive\nreading led me to make sure that everyones phone was instead turned\noff entirely.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; I have also recieved radio interference or bleed over from other\ntwo-way radios in the area that can be confused as EVP if not\nmentioned when recording audio. Still, I find 2-way radios convenient\nif not necessary for larger scale field investigations. I&#39;m sure my\ncolleagues in the Gettysburg area would agree with me ... but I also\nhear from my friend Bill Murphy that many have resorted to hand held\nGPS systems to mark particular areas of interest when conducting EVP\nor ITC sessions in the field...\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Louis\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 12/13/08, Tom Arnold &lt;topgun0123@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Tom Arnold &lt;topgun0123@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC]cpl question for team investigators\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Saturday, December 13, 2008, 6:34 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have never have had our radios mess with equipment.Cell phones\nnever off on vibrate.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 12/13/08, Rick &lt;rasterer@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Rick &lt;rasterer@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC]cpl question for team investigators\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; Date: Saturday, December 13, 2008, 2:27 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s interesting Laurie.

I can hardly hear\n&gt; anything over them chatting. Also I notice a cpl of their people\n&gt; freak out when they get knocks or other responses... nobody ever says\n&gt; hey thanks for the effort you put into responding or great job or\n&gt; anything like that..its always wtf was that, what the hell is going on\n&gt; in here, etc...do ya&#39;ll say thanks and compliment the efforts of the\n&gt; responding spirits? Ive never been on an investigation with a team so\n&gt; Im kinda curious how different groups work and run things.(wish I knew\n&gt; people in arizona I could go on an investigation with) I know when I\n&gt; do my research here with my radio shack hack I always say thanks and\n&gt; am polite and have never freaked out or cussed in response to one of\n&gt; the responses Ive gotten. Anyways just curious. Hope everyone has a\n&gt; great weekend!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rhonda\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
