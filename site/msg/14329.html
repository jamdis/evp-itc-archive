I always listen to EVP's with high  quality headphones.
 
In the "tomorrow let you know"  EVP, I do hear something...know" can't be 
sure that it is a  voice. I does have a cadence similar to someone speaking, 
but it  could just as easily be something present in the environment-it  
could just as easily be something present in the environment-<WBR>a  na it is 
just too feint. I can't make out any clear words. Sure-I  could probably 
matrix some in, but that is all it would be.
 
For an EVP to be considered proof  positive of spirit communication by the 
community at large, it has to be  clear enough that many people hear the 
same thing, without hints or  coaxing. If you have to have high quality devices 
to make it  out, it just isn't good enough. That does not mean it isn't a 
true EVP,  just that it isn't good enough to stand as evidence.
 
As for the whistle, it sounded like  feedback to me as well, but I will 
have to take you word for it that you  were no where near any other electronics 
or EMF's that could contribute to  feedback. Even so, if I am trying to 
remain unbiased and  objective, there is no way for me to say this is a spirit, 
without  personally being with you when you caught it. The only thing I can 
still  say about it is could be, but for me it is non conclusive.
 
If someone does not hear what you are  hearing, try to remain objective and 
just understand that it isn't  personal. You have to understand that with 
just these recordings alone,  there is no way to scientifically prove what 
you have recorded is  spirit communication. If you could get consistent, 
intelligent  question and answer recordings, then you would be alot  closer.
 
Here again, we are back to the "So  what?" thing. You don't HAVE to prove 
anything scientifically, unless you  want others to completely believe in 
your evidence.
 
The theory that is being kicked around  is that some EVP's are personal, 
and only meant for the person  recording them to hear. If this is the case, no 
matter how clear  something is to you, others may not hear it.

Okay, I can respect that. If you can't hear them then it must be  either 
mechanical (sound card or headphones)or maybe your hearing has  loss in those 
frequencies.Okay, I can respect that. If you can't hear them then it must be 
 either mechanical (sound card or headpho&  your headphones. I have let an 
older man listen (in his late 60's) and  he has heard most all of the audio. 
Same with a few guys at work. Some  hear them right away, and others can't 
until I loop the actually EVP for  a few tries. I personally use a Dell 
Latitude D430 to hear these. I can  hear some on my cell phone. Headphones are a 
must....or you won't hear  anything either way. *But some can be heard on 
cell phone without  headphones. The conversion to MP3 has also caused some 
loss, but I am  still able to hear them when I review from this site (but I 
have the  repetive hearing syndrome in this area no doubt). Although I do have 
 some disbelief (shock) that a few of these are not discernable. Go back  
and listen to "tomorrow let you know" is in a gruffy-robotic melodic  tone at 
the very end but with higher natural volume. And if you couldn't  hear the 
whistle...I would suggest the need to remove the cotton from  the ear :) As
