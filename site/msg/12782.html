<h1>Second week with Frank&amp;#39;s Box</h1>

<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>With permission of my client I have posted several EVP&#x27;s captured using 
my Frank&#x27;s Box.  These were captured using a recorder, same as we do 
doing a regular EVP session.  Please let me know what you think.  All 
of the files on this page came from the same session.

It is truly amazing and a bit disturbing.  The EVP&#x27;s captured corelate 
directly to the case.  There is no doubt in my mind that this was an 
intelligent being giving intelligent answers. 

This case also involves at least two women that disappeared in 1990. 
Thank you so much Frank.  We may really be able to help someone here.
