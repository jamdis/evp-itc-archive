I used to do it often when I was a kid I would wake up in a totally different position than I thought I was laying in when I had my eyes closed. I&#39;d think I was layin on my stomache and realize I was flat on my back or on my side. With gravity its pretty easy to feel which end is facing down and once I am fully alert its a little disorientating at first. I am curious if anybody else has that experience, including those who travel out of body at will.\n   \n  Misty\n    \n---------------------------------\n  Luggage? GPS?
