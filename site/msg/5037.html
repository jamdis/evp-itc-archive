As I stated at the beginning of the MiniBox project, the goal is to 
get as many MiniBoxes into researchers' hands as possible, and 
considered eBay as a marketing possibility. I arranged for two Boxes 
to go on the block with no reserves to see what open bidding would 
bring.

As it happens, both units went to active researchers on this forum, 
so in that respect I'm glad it worked out that way. However both 
units went at low prices, one below cost, so in order to survive we 
had to set a reserve for future auctions.

We have also solicited active feedback from all our users so that 
new ideas and improvements can be added down the line. I'm pleased 
that Bruce and Steve have been extremely helpful with their ideas 
and suggestions.

Also, I want it understood that Frank and I have an ongoing dialog 
regarding designs, uses of the Box, improvements and so on. We have 
a free and open exchange of ideas. I have asked him to let me know 
if he ever has any problems with using his name. Moreover, anyone 
reading the literature and comments regarding Frank that I have made 
can see that they are solely to give him credit for his work, and to 
quote things he has said or written to me.

I think many good things come from persons dedicated to a goal. I 
commend Mike C. for his efforts re: the Shack Hack, and consider it 
a great starting place for those who are technically inclined and on 
a budget. The search for other suitable radios should commence, if 
it hasn't already. The key is to cooperate with each other and share 
information and results. ASUP will be holding an orientation class 
and training session for users of the Box at its next meeting. They 
will be researching using a strict testing protocol, and recording 
each session as it happens. Over time, teams using the same gear 
should be able to collect information which can be collated and 
studied for patterns. This is the next step in ITC research, and one 
which can provide the hard evidence.
