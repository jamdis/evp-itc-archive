<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m hearing &quot;that irks me,&quot; or &quot;that hurts me,&quot; something similar,  
not Sumption. That said, however, I think it&#x27;s fascinating that the  
boxes are still attached to Frank. You would think they could see he  
isn&#x27;t present.

&gt; Well shoot I was hopin it was the same one. Yeah I thought 12 meant  
&gt; number and 5 meant 5th one. LOL just when ya think ya get it all  
&gt; figured out.
&gt;
&gt; Heres a couple I got in my tests yesterday using the sweep tuning  
&gt; method.

&gt; I think that voice was from a later box. I made two of these boxes

&gt; usually the order received or heard. The other one is AM/FM, but  
&gt; the AM
&gt; tuner takes a screwy tuning voltage, so it doens&#x27;t work right. I  
&gt; want to
&gt; just add a different AM tuner, and keep the FM tuner. That one has  
&gt; the steel
&gt; box too, but I don&#x27;t remember if it&#x27;s the wave guide box.
&gt;
&gt; All of the later Boxes are made so the Echo box can be easily  
&gt; replaced, and
&gt; some have front panel jacks to allow the use of other echo boxes. I  
&gt; quite
&gt; putting in those jacks, as most had no understanding of their use,  
&gt; even if I
&gt; explained it.

&gt; &gt;#13 Doesnt look so ugly to me Frank. I think it would be cool if  
&gt; it had the
&gt; &gt;option for both but not a necessity. Is #12 the one you got my  
&gt; name/voice
&gt; &gt;on? &quot;this is Misty Dawn&quot; I still have that sound clip saved hehehe  
&gt; I cant
&gt; &gt;remember but the sound files had 12 at the start of it and i think  
&gt; thats
&gt; &gt;how you were numbering them at one point. I kinda remember 13&#x27;s  
&gt; tests but
&gt; &gt;it wasnt around long enough to gather much info. Was around the  
&gt; time when
&gt; &gt;we tested video itc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway heres the that file from that box 12 if it was indeed as  
&gt; labled.
&gt; &gt;Oh and if it is 12 then when u fix that one let&#x27;s play with it a  
&gt; bit before
&gt; &gt;it goes anywhere LOL.

&gt; &gt; This is a box returned. I replaced the capacitors in the whithe

&gt; &gt;that control the gain, and voila--kick butt box. This is one of  
&gt; two that I
&gt; &gt;tried &quot;ugly construction&quot; , where the components are mounted on an  
&gt; unetched
&gt; &gt;piece of copper clad board in an effort to reduce size. One  
&gt; drawback with
&gt; &gt;this box is it&#x27;s AC powered, so not portable to places wihtout  
&gt; power--like
&gt; &gt;grave yards, so I might convert it. I have one more of these, #12,  
&gt; but the
&gt; &gt;tuner needs to be replaced.
