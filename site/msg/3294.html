Misty,
  Very interesting.  I wonder if a lot of this comes down to some sort of clairaudient ability developing in experimenters.  I mean, the voices are definitely there, but depending on your level of clairaudience (inborn or developing with experimentation) you hear the voices more clearly?  
  Thanks for your insight.

  For me there is no translating. I hear what I hear and sometimes it differs from what others hear. I think perhaps clarity comes over time. They improve on thier end, you improve on yours. 
   
  I still have to xx out the one word I didnt quite understand even tho the sentence was very long and well said. I just document each and move on. They said in one evp that "5 to 1 people dont hear perfectly". I had asked why theres such a difference in perceptions. Reminded me of some test they gave in school where everyone wears earphones and they make you raise your hand when you hear a tone. 
   
  I sometimes get the CLEAREST evp ever and only a couple people hear it as I do. Then there are times when I get messages that I think are "crappy" in quality and yet everybody can hear the same message. I learned a long time ago what each individual hears is thier own perception, and that if they cant hear a message it just wasnt meant for thier ears to hear. Most things we get are for us but there have been times when messages are sent for others. 
   
  As far as translating goes, go with phonetics and work your way up from there. I often get messages in other languages so actual translation must be performed. Just because I speak a few words of spanish or french doesnt mean I can translate spanish or french dialogue without lots of help LOL. Chinese Cantonese German..yeah anything is possible. My experience has been very well rounded. Phonetics have helped in all cases. Especially when they give thier names

      I'm getting voices, but for the life of me I can't translate them. 
I've been listening to the other members' files and reading the 
translations, but while I hear the voices I don't see how the 
translations are arrived at from the voices recorded. What's the 
secret to translating? Is is something that comes over time?
Thanks for any tips,
Ursula
