In 2000 I dug out the magazine, and tried EVP again, using white noise from the radio, and this time someone spoke to me. I�ve been hooked ever since. Using noise, and having to listen at high volume through headphones made my ears ring, so I started searching the web for other methods, and found EVPmaker. I used that program for a couple years, but kept getting messages relayed from spirits that couldn�t use the computer. So I decided to try to come up with a more universal method, and after a couple weeks of thinking about it, my present system kinda popped into my head, fully formed, all I had to do was build it. 
  I still used others methods, because there�s times when some of the methods don�t work, so I switch modes to keep getting the voices. Her at work I can use EVPmaker pretty consistently, but it hardly ever produces anything at home.
