&gt; Misty, can you please remove Nathan&#x27;s access to this site. I just 
spent the last several minutes deleting these e-mails that have 
nothing to do with our mission and research purposes of this site.
&gt;    
&gt;   Not sure about the rest of the members, but this guy is 
interfering with our work and correspondence, and you have given him 
every chance to shape up and respect our wishes.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi guys !!!I hope Bruce does not mind me posting this.I had
&gt; questions whether my RS is working or not,so, I consulted with
&gt; Bruce.He asked me a few questions on my set up and to send a test
&gt; session. So, I let the session run on its own and sent him the raw
&gt; file.Well, sure enough, it is working just fine. I had some static 
and
&gt; learned to move the radio around to a better spot.But amazingly one 
of
&gt; the messages was &quot; I want to see Bruce !&quot;You can hear it clear as 
day.
&gt; Also, I got some vulgar messages and I wonder about this. When 
Debbie
&gt; did a session with me in the beginning she got some eye opening
&gt; messages for me. One was &quot;cut the bull ----&quot;. Debbie said that can&#x27;t
&gt; be !!! but it was right on !!! we were trying to contact my mom and
&gt; that was one of her favorite sayings here !!! LOLHowever, the 
messages
&gt; Bruce recovered in my session were a little more vulgar and not
&gt; something from my mom.I also had events in the house after starting
&gt; recording sessions.The RS box would go on by itself, not while I was
&gt; home, and I live alone. This happened several times, the third time 
I
&gt; came home my computerized clothes dryer locked it&#x27;s control panel, 
the
&gt; RS was on and my wireless router needed to be reset. I now need help
&gt; with Audacity or sound booth. I don&#x27;t know how to use it to clean 
the
&gt; background noise up.Thanks again Bruce (I hope you don&#x27;t mind my
&gt; posting !!??)Holly
