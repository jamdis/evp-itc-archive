<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce.  I hear most the content in your clips as you are.  On this one, I believe it says, &quot;I 
will get us AIR speech.&quot;  I have repeatedly been told with this method that &#x27;air&#x27; has 
something to do with the communication.  

Not sure what Arthur&#x27;s definition of &#x27;air&#x27; is, but it is definitely key to what is taking place.  
He&#x27;s used terms and phrases like &quot;Air-to-air&quot; - &quot;Air Ports&quot; - &quot;Air Portals&quot; - &quot;Helps you 
enter our air&quot; - &quot;They&#x27;ll give you air to us&quot; - &quot;I have air&quot; etc.  MANY references.
