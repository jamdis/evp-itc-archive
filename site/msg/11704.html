Chad,
You are trying to hard. You don't need to add a mix of white noise in=
.
All you have to do is turn it on and just listen. If they want to talk
to=

you ( which I think they will) they will talk . You will be able to tell
t=
he 
difference between the scans and the voices. You can get a microphone
a=
t radio shack if you want.
If you want to talk to the them, just start aski=
ng the questions that
you want answers for. 
You will be surprised if you j=
ust listen.
I have the 469 and 470, and the 12-469 works the best for me.
D=
eb

How do you=
 guys have the 469 set up? I've hacked the radio, but do not
have a port in=
to my sound card. Any suggestions of different
configurations that have wor=
ked well for you. I'm in Atlanta so we
have a lot of stations and I'm getti=
ng what seems like a lot of one
station or another when it scans. Do you fi=
nd it necessary to mix the
raw audio with white noise?
