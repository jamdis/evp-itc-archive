guitar strings idea. ;)

&gt; Hi LC,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!  I sent one Gabs way, but I still have the one with the 
&gt; wires.  I&#x27;m still testing it every once in awhile too.
&gt; I need more time on it though to see if it&#x27;s worth the build.

&gt; &gt; Hey, Mike C...heard your interview on Glimpse Through the Veil 
with 
&gt; &gt; Gab...nice job, buddy!  Loved the cemetery note story...just 
&gt; &gt; brilliant!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; How&#x27;s that little chamber do-hicky working for you, btw? ;)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Ron,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hopefully your sister has received the radio already.  It got 
&gt; &gt; shipped 
&gt; &gt; &gt; priority mail.  Have fun with it.  I really like the way the FM 
&gt; &gt; scan 
&gt; &gt; &gt; rate is....
&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will be traveling to San Diego from Mexico to visit my 
sister 
&gt; &gt; and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; pick up the RS 125 Mike is sending me.  I will be in the San 
&gt; Diego 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and El Centro area from Feb 15 to 19 and I would love to be 
able 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; meet-up with someone from the area who has experience with EVP 
&gt; &gt; &gt; technology.  Mike is sending a box already hacked so we can 
work 
&gt; &gt; with 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the box and hopefully get something recorded.  Since I have 
&gt; little 
&gt; &gt; &gt; experience as a newbie to this, I would love to see how someone 
&gt; &gt; puts 
&gt; &gt; &gt; all of it together...recording, analyzing, etc.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   If you have the time and are willing to give a little on-
the-
&gt; &gt; job 
&gt; &gt; &gt; training, please let me know by email.  By the way, in mid June 
I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; will be traveling from Penn. to NC for two weeks and would love 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; get together with folks over in that area.  I will probably be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; ordering a mini-box to be sent to my folks house in Allentown, 
so 
&gt; I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; will have that to play with.  Let me know.  Ron Lederer
