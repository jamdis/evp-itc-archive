Love the photo Frank!  
   
  I think people get burned out all the time, and some just teeder on the edge.  You just need to know when to step  back and not push it to the limits where it consumes your soul.  
   
  This happened a few month back with him and at that time I told him to take some time and enjoy life and come out of the "Box Cave".
   
  I think that many have forgot they actually have a Life, one where you get up, go to that place they call work, and upon the day's conclusion enjoy quality time with your family.  I remember I time when my children forgot who I was.  I too seen myself obsessed with trying to achieve communication, but soon realized they are always going to be there.  It's my children who are going to grow up quicker than I want, and they are not!
   
  Just my thoughts!

I've heard/seen others use the boxes at the Stanley--the only haunted place I've ever been too, and was surprised at the Q & A, as it worked. Like, dah, forgot about that--sorry!
