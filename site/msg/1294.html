Yep I can hear those. I like twists, its what makes the world go round 
   
  Do they have meaning for you is the question? You know a Chris or Sam? Tight pants? Not sure I wanna know the meaning on that last one LOL. But if you are hearing your name spoken, and references to those around you or directed at you specifically then you know that 1) no that wasnt a fluke radio broadcast tidbit, and 2) yes you actually did accomplish what you set out to.
   
  For me I have heard a few of the same voices using all techniques. It's what others hear and clarity that differs with each method. Sometimes I will get the clearest sounds a few hear them perfect as I do...others hear something but they dont know what. Some people use headphones, I prefer stereo speakers rather than computer speakers. Pc to 5 band equalizer to dual x-bass speakers so when I say I blow my ears off I mean it. Headphones just dont cut it for me, or give me earaches from wearing it too long LOL 
   
  Just keep moving forward. Ask them for suggestions on how to improve they usually will offer guidance to those ask.
