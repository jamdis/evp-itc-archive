&gt; I was hoping to listen to the show but I firgot what day it was on 
&gt; until it was too late I had just missed her and the next guys were 
&gt; on. Then I was hoping to catch it on the replay tonight but the 
radio 
&gt; at work will not dial down 15 to where the station is =/
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to &quot;will&quot; it to go down 15 on the dial from 565 to 540 but 
I 
&gt; just aint that mentally powerful I guess LOL. 
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah I know I should just get a membership over there, there and 
alot 
&gt; of other places who charge fees for info that is public(ahem)LOL. 
Not 
&gt; happening this year. Over a grand on the vet bills, personal loans 
to 
&gt; friends, bills, and now its christmas and I was going to play 
scrooge 
&gt; but they are already askin about what I did last year wonderin if I 
&gt; was doin it for everyone again this year so... 
&gt; 
&gt; Instead I told my bosses to give my hours to those who need $$$ for 
&gt; holidays because they are cutting back everyones hours for a couple 
&gt; weeks. Besides I could use the rest LOL. Doubt they will but I will 
&gt; insist they cut me rather than a fulltime mom with 3 kids who needs 
&gt; every cent she earns and then some.
&gt; 
&gt; So hoping I have a few extra days off this year to listen to you 
guys 
&gt; radio chats. Theres quite a few of them now. Ive downloaded those 
&gt; that would let me so I can listen to them and share them with a 
&gt; friend at work.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has that podcast email me.
