Since \n&gt; &gt; &gt; according to Theosophy the next Astrological Age, the Age of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aquarius, will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) Ray (the \nRay \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes called &#39;The \n&gt; Hierarch \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Age of Aquarius&#39;. According to the Ascended Master \n&gt; Teachings, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Saint Germain is &#39;The God of Freedom for the Earth&#39;.&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Much to do with the Purple Princess, and the seven. I don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; mean \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to sell others short, I just get a different level, and find \n&gt; &gt; &gt; regular &quot;this your auntie&quot; type EVPs kinda useless. Mostly I \n&gt; don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; post every voice I get, just the ones that I thought was \n&gt; &gt; outstanding, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but no one else hears.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Make i&#39;m yours.
