Ron,

If and when you get the chance, try this out. It is an active antenna=
 that acts as a 60' longwire. I believe Sumption may have posted this befor=
e. Ramsey Electronics is a favorite of mine so I cruise their site a lot.

Thanks for the encouragement Bruce.=
  You are correct I have a rs 12-469 and I cut the pin so it scans continua=
lly when needed.   I at times used audacity on my computer to record, think=
ing that speed control would be useful to interpret messages...nice thought=
.   I like the simplicity of your suggestion to just plug the radio directl=
y into the digital recorder.  Not knowing exactly how all this goes down, I=
 thought the radio scan sounds need to mix in the room so that the techs on=
 the other side can respond.  Whatever works.  
   
  The other main questi=
on I have is regarding the radio stations I can pick up here in my part of =
Mexico, on the Yucatan.  I only get several stations during a complete scan=
 of all a.m. or f.m. channels...don' t know if that is enough.  It has been=
 suggested that I somehow can add an antenna to search for more channels, w=
hich I would attempt if it is
 really necessary.  I get mostly Spanish lang=
uage stations and an occasional station from Texas that skips across the Gu=
lf of Mexico.  Not much to scan.  Any thoughts on this?
   
  By the way, I=
 think the work you are doing is, well, extraordinary.    Like pros from an=
y other field of endeavor, you make this stuff look easy to do...not so.  T=
hanks again.   Ron L

      Hey Ron
 L.,
 
In my experience it does not matter what =
language you recieve the signal in.
The entities are using only fragments, =
small bits and pieces of the radio signal
to form the words. Therefore it d=
oes not matter if the radio signal is in spanish 
or english or any other l=
anguage for that matter.
 
Our friends on the other side will manipulate th=
e fragments they need to communicate 
with you in the language you will und=
erstand.
 
Ron you mention that you are using an rs 690 that is not one of =
the hack model numbers 
maybe you have gotten the wrong radio model. Check =
the part number it must be a 12-469
or a 12-470 and if it is the 470 it wou=
ld have to be the older model or it could not be modified.
 
Can you verify=
 that you have modified the rs radio and that it is continually scanning wi=
thout
stopping on any one particular station?
 
Also there would be no need=
 for EVP maker or a microphone to be
 used during a session with the RS box=

all you would need is the RS box and a digital recorder, if you have the 4=
69 you would need speakers to 
record the session or plug the digital recor=
der directly into the radio.
 
Please check your equipment and how it is op=

Don't worry they are jus=

  Bruce, I now have done a =
few days testing with my rs 690, evp maker, audacity, a mic, and my handhel=

 a response.  But from what you and others with experience seem to be sayin=
