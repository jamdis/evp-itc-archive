<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have a modified 12-587 and I have been listening but it is really hard to gather any intelligable speech from the scnning because of the proliferation of radio stations in my area.

I listened to every attached sound file here that I could and some of them do not sound like intelligible responses but gibberish from mised radio words OR even parts of radio sentences.

I understand that the best way is to ask questions and then wait for responses, but some of the audio posted here &quot;seems&quot; like plain radio gibberish.

Can someone help me understand?

As a side note anyone that has an iPhone can get iOVILUS and have a 1000 word database that uses the iPhone sensors to allow entities to manipulate and then produces speech.
