<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes the R is a rolling R and &quot;proving&quot; is high pitched... however just going on my own ears without any suggestions, it could also sound like &quot;hide keira&quot; or &quot;hi keira&quot;, and &quot;we&#x27;re proving&quot; could also sound like &quot;improving&quot;.. either the sound file or the communication is not very clear... does it sound clearer than this in real life, or is the recorder pretty much capturing it as clearly as it can?

&gt;  So somebody does hear it? The r is rolling, kinda like in Spanish. (so I didn&#x27;t know how to spell it)

&gt; &gt; Wouldn&#x27;t that be &quot;Keira&quot; like in the actress Keira Knightley?

&gt; &gt; &gt;  From Ouija Box 4. Check the pronunciation of Kiera, that is exactly what it
&gt; &gt; &gt; is supposed to sound like and never coulds figure out how to spell that.
