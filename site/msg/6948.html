      Frank,
               I have to agree with you on this.  I have attached some clips where I ask what my roll is.  They advised me of several things.  Some of the key words are in the clips and the fact that they acknowledge we need proof is amazing to me.  The tec's as well call them are reflected in the last clip when I asked if I should do a session.  A female say no, and then proceeds to response "you will see".  For whatever its worth, if I get some sort of direction as a response, I comply (by choice and in reason).  I can't help but wonder if sometimes they don't have a best interest at heart?  Whether they do or not, this is extremely exciting to me, and count my blessing everyday that I am was lead on this path and will continue to follow where ever it takes me.

This viewpoint is also shared by many of the "pioneers" and their miraculous contacts of the 80's and 90's. The words such as tech, gatekeeper, facilitator, or whatever may change but the function remains the same. Don't get caught up in the semantics. LOL

If you are looking for proof, ask your heart what is real.

    Hey, thanks Frank R, I'm glad I asked.  Now I want to ask how you know all this, but I'm not going to.  I will work a bit to digest what you just told me.  Cheers   Ron L

          Sure, I was just being considerate. Didn't want to butt in... he he A bridge or contact bridge is a link between you and other entities. Not just spirits who have transitioned but also living entities. You can form a bridge with the help of other researchers and colleagues on the other side of the veil. This is the link you communicate over! A contact field is the field each of us generate to make that link. It is controlled by our desire to make contact. Both concepts will grow in strength and weaken depending on the resonance or harmony you share with others in the bridge.

The technicians or techs that Bruce and others like to call them are facilitators or gatekeepers. They control the window or gate when contact is made or the bridge is activated. A lot of the time you may not even know who they are. My primary guide and gatekeeper does not want to be identified, which is apparent in the message I received when I asked: "It is not important, just know that I love you very much". That is the answer I got when I asked who my primary facilitator was.

I say primary because there seems to be more than one who will operate the "gate". I catch chatter all the time asking who is on the gate or who is operating the gate and so on. Some are more forceful and controlling than others and some are more liberal on who they let through. Just know it is okay to ask them to limit who is let through, how you would like them to speak (clearly and one at a time) or how you want to be addressed.

Regards,

Frank R.

  Any idea what "the bridge" signifies in this message?  I have a connection to that term.
