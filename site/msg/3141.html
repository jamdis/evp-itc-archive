<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Joining me as a special guest on my Tuesday Nov 20th Paranormal Podcast 
was Rick Moran, Director &amp; Coordinator of The Association for the Study 
of Unexplained Phenomenon (ASUP). Rick is also the co-builder (along 
with Ron Ricketts) of The Mini Box, a newly designed &quot;Ghost Box&quot; coming 
into production very soon.
The proto-type Mini Box was recently shown and tested at the Stanley 
Hotel in Colorado. On my recent BlogTalkRadio show Rick Moran joined me 
to talk a bit about the Mini Box and to tell the listeners about what 
happened while the Mini Box was performing at the Stanley Hotel this 
past weekend. This was probably Rick&#x27;s first on-air interview since the 
demonstration at the Stanley Hotel, and it&#x27;s a very interesting one.
