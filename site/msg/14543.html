   Same old crap, these self proclaimed experts have no idea what=

   "Exp=

 provide a raw audio, in the early days, but it was piss poor at best! Forg=
et that crap, you need something that provides human speech bits, and frequ=
encies. Of course you can get direct direct recordings without noise or raw=
 audio, but---it tends to be weak noise that most of time are questionable.=
 

   So just for the record, the box functions by sweeping a radio across =
it's tuning range, the resulting bits of human specch, music and noise is r=

          Been following this unprofessional idiot's =

          This dude is the worst type =

 Frank's box. Then again, it always has bothered me when people take shack =
