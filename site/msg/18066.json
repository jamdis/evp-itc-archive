This is the first  \n&gt; time I have ever tried to do an experiment like this, so I have no clue as to \n&gt;  if I am even close or not. I came up with &quot;a rock&quot;. I will make a folder \n&gt; in my  name and post it so, if by chance it is right, you can listen to it \n&gt; ahead of  time.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is really interesting, even if I came up totally  wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; Beth\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com_ (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) ,  \n&gt; SnowfireL@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; RJ, I did not ask spirit for evidence,  they have nothing to prove to me, \n&gt; &gt; because it is as i said before,  this is subject to the listener for the \n&gt; most \n&gt; &gt; part. They are real  people over there just like here, and for this type \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; communication  to be coming out now was a part of God&#39;s plan. Except it \n&gt; &gt; not. The  Wright Brother&#39;s were laughed at too, people thought flying was \n&gt; &gt; nuts!  Yet here we are today flying all over the place, lol everything \n&gt; &gt;  material in existence today was once first in the realm of spirit or a \n&gt; thought  \n&gt; &gt; like state, I believe Jung called the prototypes of everything,  \n&gt; Archtypes, \n&gt; &gt; Some might think of the Archtype for the person a guardian  angel of each \n&gt; &gt; spirit.sf\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In a message dated  7/11/2010 10:11:49 A.M.
