I have contacted the manufacturer for an explanation, he \ninstructed me to listen to the audio file and view the demo video on \nhis site. After doing so my opinion on this box and the builders \nintentions for it is.\n\nThe box itself is not a knock off of Frank&#39;s box but a cheap and \nineffective version of Joe&#39;s box,It works on an AM band instead of an \nFM band as Joe&#39;s box does. Another big difference is Joe&#39;s box \nactually works and you have all heard the files I have posted from \nsessions with it. After listening to this box and seeing it in \noperation I feel that anyone who purchases this box will be very \ndisappointed and will not receive any contact from it and even if \nthey did they probably would not even realise it for the simple fact \nthat you have to have a certain amount of experience with box \nresearch and operation before developing an ear for picking up real \ntime communication and also creating a bond with the spirit friends \non the other side and also a measure of trust on both sides.\n\nI believe the manufacturer to be a capitalist and only interested in \nthe monetary reward to be gained from offering this cheap and \nineffective copy to unsuspecting and naive individuals who are \ninterested in this medium. I do not like to bad mouth anyone, it \nusually comes back to bite you in the ass but I believe that our \nfriends on the other side know of our intentions and would not allow \nsomeone with the wrong intentions to develop a working tool for \ncommunication. also I believe that a person does not pick the box the \nbox picks the person. \n\nSo let him have his short and lucrative run with this fooling \nunsuspecting clients, bad karma always comes home.\n\n\nBruce"}
