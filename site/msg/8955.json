If that is your motivation, that would be entirely up to you.  ;-)\n\nI fault the buyers much more so than the sellers ... who would not be able to sell units like \nthis at the prices he is, if the buyers would not buy at that price.  \n\nI also try not to judge people without knowing their circumstances.  Most of us could use a \nlittle more money in our pockets, and as long as we come by the money honestly, so be it.  \nHe has set a price.  Obviously others find it fair or they would not willingly pay it.  And \npeople would not bid against one another to the point of the price becoming ridiculous, \nbut they do.  Again, can&#39;t fault the sellers for that.  \n\nAs I said in my early post, goods and services can only be sold for whatever the market \nwill bear.  We are not talking necessities here.  It&#39;s a radio.  A &#39;luxury&#39; item, so to speak.  \nAnd one that could be bought and hacked for half the price.  But for whatever reason, \npeople are willing to buy at this premium price.  \n\nIf you were thinking like a business man, you&#39;d do exactly the same thing and under cut \nhim by $5!  LOL.  Now THAT would make a statement.  Selling at a loss only says, &quot;I&#39;m a \nfool.&quot;  Just my thoughts on the subject.  Sorry.  It&#39;s my corporate mentality coming though.  \nI spent 15-years in the highly competitive field of computer sales where the attitude was \nthat of looking at what is working for others, finding a way to it better, or just as well, \noffering it at lower price that is still profitable to you, and taking as much business away \nas possible from the other guy.  \n\nMargaret   \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Marlboro63@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Margaret,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I realize that but to lose a couple of bucks might be worth it just to  \n&gt; aggrevate this guy.....:)\n&gt;  \n&gt; Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **************Planning your summer road trip?
