I am walking down the hall towards the meeting room with the older lady..=

hear a female voice say "Guys No". 
 Now bear in mind this is a class B EVP=
 not as good as the others. It may not even say what I think it said.....bu=
t.
  That older lady and I had just walked away from Gel,Steph and Elissa a=
nd Jason, who had all just walked out on the patio to confront the "lady" w=
ho was seen sitting outside. Is it possible that she follow that other wome=
n and I down the hall expressing her desire to be left alone?
