<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Pretty good files, Steve.  I love the British sounding accent in 
the &quot;Are you uptight?&quot; file!! For some reason, this one sounded 
more &quot;human&quot; to me than other speakjet files I have heard...  :)

&gt; New Box from Rob showed up today, the Speakjet #4.  I was planning on 
&gt; taking the day off from this, but i got sucked right back in again.  
&gt; The files are a bit rough sounding, i was moving around a lot but got 
&gt; some good files.  I&#x27;m only 2 minutes into a 8 minute session, but i 
&gt; need to eat and sleep.  I posted what i got so far, i didn&#x27;t want to 
&gt; let Rob down by getting it and not posting files from it the same 
day.  
&gt; That&#x27;s not my style, i appreciate him doing that for me and hope to 
get 
&gt; much more from it as i experiment.  Remember deadscience.com is where 
&gt; to go for more info on the speakjet boxes.
