I&#39;d be happy to be \npart of the second test too.\n&gt; \n&gt; One thing I&#39;d suggest: remove any question(s) that you are asking, \nfrom the audio file. Since you&#39;re trying to study how different \npeople will interpret the same file, and are trying not to give any \nhints as to what other people hear in the file, leaving the question \nin could be a factor there. For example, if you are asking a yes/no \nquestion in the audio, then the people listening might be inclined to \nrestrict their answers to having heard a &quot;yes&quot; or a &quot;no&quot; (because the \nquestion implies that is what may follow). But by leaving the \nquestion out, you remove any hints as to what they should expect.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Fri, 1/23/09, nightparanormalrese arch &lt;nightparanormalrese \narch@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: nightparanormalrese arch &lt;nightparanormalrese arch@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Need Volenters Test 2 and Info about ME\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; Date: Friday, January 23, 2009, 6:11 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The first test did not go so well participation levels were not so \n&gt; good and that may be partaly my fault so I would like to try this \n&gt; again .\n&gt; I have a different file I would like to privatly email to anyone \n&gt; willing to listen to it. All you have to do is send me what you \nhear \n&gt; and how clear it was to you.\n&gt; \n&gt; I dont know if I have ever made mention of this before but my time \n&gt; is extremly limited I work Mon-Thurs 6am till 5pm then go to school \n&gt; those days 630 till 930pm so fri sat and sun are the only days I \nhave \n&gt; to answer emails or read the board. also igo by the screan name \n&gt; nightparanormalrese arch (obviosly).The name Northern IL Ghost \nHunting \n&gt; Team is my wife Sarah we are both part of the same nonprofit \n&gt; organization here in our home town (N.I.G.H.T). So if iam a little \n&gt; busy I may have her answer somthing or post somthing if Iam unable \n&gt; otherwise youll always get me first thing friday and sat so if \n&gt; someone has a question on a post for me depending on what day it is \n&gt; you may have to wait till fri or sat. \n&gt; I just wanted to put that out ther so noone thinks Iam ignoring \n&gt; them or not answering emails. \n&gt; Now back to the test I will send out the new file to all those who \n&gt; participated in the last one and any one who would also like to \n&gt; participate let me know via email nightparanormalrese arch@yahoo. \ncom\n&gt; and i will gladly send it to you.If you participated on the last \none \n&gt; but dont want to on this one just ignore the email ill be sending.\n&gt; Thank you to all those who have taken the time to listen to the \n&gt; first one and I truly apoligize that it was a bust but I think this \n&gt; one will be alot better as I have mor time to spend and i wont be \n&gt; rushing.\n&gt;"}
