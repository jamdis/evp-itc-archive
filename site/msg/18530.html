<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes...by definition, literally translated, paranormal means anything outside
of normal. Yes, technically you can call anything you don&#x27;t understand
paranormal, until you figure out a normal explanation for it.


&quot;Thinking the boxes or ghost fit this extremely wide paranormal definition
is is useless.&quot;

If they cannot be explained, then they could fit there. However, ghosts
boxes themselves are not paranormal. We can explain their existence. We know
how they are made and what they do. It&#x27;s their transmissions that are in
question.


&quot; The main problem here are those few that think somehow they are so
much more qualified and superior that they can dictate how and what everyone
else thinks and does. There are sick individuals on both sides, believers
and skeptics that fall into this. I know one guy that has to believe the
boxes and seemingly all things paranormal started with him and he&#x27;ll
threaten violence on anyone that disagrees. Another thinks he is the only
one that properly use the boxes and can determine who uses them. How many
sites are on the web claiming to be the world&#x27;s experts on the box, or the
paranormal?&quot;

I completely agree. There are no paranormal experts, regardless of what some
people tend to label themselves.


&quot; What about the skeptics that can accept no evidence--they too claim there
is nothing paranormal, but they can&#x27;t test any boxes themselves, can not
accept any evidence, and thus having nothing to stand on resort to name
calling to try to get the paranormal to go away. &quot;

People like these are not true skeptics. These people are debunkers, cynics,
whatever you want to call them. They are the ones that would not believe
anything, no matter the evidence presented. Most of the time they won&#x27;t even
look at the evidence as they are so sure they have it all figured out.

True skeptics neither believe, nor disbelieve. True skeptics remain open to
any possibility, whether that be paranormal, or not.


&quot; I remember reading in some books when I was younger how the paranormal and
psychic endeavours are not for everyone, some get into this field and go
insane, and there is evidencee for that.&quot;

Yes. There are crazies in just about any field, religion, etc. but the
paranormal gets more then it&#x27;s fair share I&#x27;d say.

&gt;
&gt;  As far as threatening goes, does anyone realize threatening via e-mail is
&gt; a federal crime? The FBI does in fact have a site set up for reporting these
&gt; crimes.

&gt;&gt;&gt; you think &quot;paranormal&quot; is. Does something have to be presented on TAPS, or

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   Since my personal results do not show anything paranormal,  I ask
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experts to help with the tests: the experts being the people here. That I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; way I can learn.  I have contributed a testing process so far, run several
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; public tests, and even though they were not positive results, I did not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;tout it all over the web&quot;.  I have not criticized.  I just don&#x27;t
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; automatically believe everything people tell me.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t understand why you would think that should be reason to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kicked out of the group.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  That is really obnoxious! Like no one knows all you want to do is build
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up a list of failed predictions so you can tout it out all over the web and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make a name for yourself. There are some here that suggest you be kicked off
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the group cuz you contribute nothing, can&#x27;t do any recordings of your own,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can&#x27;t hear any of the EVPs, can&#x27;t see any of the images, yet are quick to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; criticize and test everyone else.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Same old thing, heard them talking about &quot;it hits the earth&quot; again last
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; night while testing one of those single supply dual sweep boxes, so set up a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The jack thing is Jack FM, 105.5 FM a rock station. Presumable 2012. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; December 21st date from the Mayans seems to be a middle number, there&#x27;s like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a window right around Christmas, as they seem to mention the 17th along with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this stuff. Who knows if it means anything, but what I don&#x27;t like are those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that profess to &quot;know better&quot;.
