  I think the thing is that there are some of us here (well, at =
least one and maybe two) who could care less what the rest of the world thi=
nks. We aren't out to prove anything to the world. We're not intertestid in=
 "studies" or "grants." We know what we can get and we just do it for the e=
njoyment of hearing the EVP/ITC communication ourselves

  I am in this cat=
egory and I have a feeling Frank is to some extent, too.

  Zack.
