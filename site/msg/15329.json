Care to explain?  \n&gt; \n&gt; I hacked the 12-469 but the clicking is driving me crazy... the only good thing is i can count how many channels the answers came across and explain to my teammates that 7 (example) channels were changed while that answer came through.\n&gt; \n&gt; I seen the video on YouTube from Urkel showing 12-587 scanning..looks like it would work good.\n&gt;"}
