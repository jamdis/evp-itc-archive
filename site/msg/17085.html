We aren't very close to you.=C2=A0We had Tom Lynch come here from NH last y=
ear in June. He did not get much in the way of solid proof. HOWEVER, he'd h=
eard parts of what I have discussed here in this message, over the phone wi=
th us. 
=C2=A0
We did get positive Mel meter,( EMF,) IR=C2=A0Thermometer an=
d=C2=A0KII meter readings. We used an, danged if I can think of the name, i=
t uses predictive voice and begins with an O. We used night cameras, EVP re=
corders, Frank's boxes, etc.
=C2=A0
I usually don't have trouble talking to=
 or removing spirits/ crossing them over. This is just so different than an=
ything else I've experienced. We have done the only talking about "it" in t=
he car thing or away from home but it makes no difference.Maybe we are focu=
sing on it too much lately. We aren't sleeping well. We are tired. We are a=
ggravated as a result and Jay works in a very high pressure job and needs t=
o be on top of things. 
=C2=A0
So far, it's quiet today.
=C2=A0

Take every=
 chance you get because some things only happen once...
