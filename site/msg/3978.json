I think it works pretty \nwell. But I LOVE the Mini-Box!&quot;\n-----\n\nJust thought I&#39;d share.\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;April Slaughter&quot; &lt;aprilrebuilt@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am very excited for this! I think it will be a good, informative\n&gt; show. I was able to deliver the very first of the production\n&gt; mini-boxes to Rosemary this past Sunday while on the Queen Mary. \n&gt; \n&gt; We spent time with all the different devices. The RadioShack Hack was\n&gt; very surprising!! \n&gt; \n&gt; All of this technology is fantastic. So glad to see so many minds\n&gt; working out there to combine and create ideas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Have a great show Rosemary!!! :)\n&gt;"}
