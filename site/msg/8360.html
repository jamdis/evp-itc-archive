<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thank you for listening and confirming, Stefan.  I thought the &#x27;talk therapy&#x27; remark was 
very funny as well.  There was nothing removed between that statement and my having 
asked if anybody was there.  The response was immediate.  Very cool.

I like various EVP techniques .... recording in silence, or using various backgrounds, and 
I&#x27;m a big fan of manual radio sweep.  I also have had positive results with the Radio Shack 
hacks, and I&#x27;m having a good time with my MiniBox.  So, now I have added EVP Maker to 
my list.  Fabulous!  :-)

&gt; Hi Margaret,
&gt; 
&gt; yes, you done it right - congrats! :) I can hear it almost like you;
&gt; only the last two parts sound different to me. Instead of &quot;How can I do
&gt; you for?&quot;, I hear &quot;How am I to you? (or)&quot;. The last part is
&gt; unintelligible for my (non-english) ears. The best part is definitely
&gt; the phrase &quot;I&#x27;m at the talk therapy group.&quot; Obviously the `guys do have
&gt; a sense of humor...

&gt; &gt; Thanks so much for the SJ Allophones files, Stefan!
&gt; &gt; I got an amazing response - well, amazing to me, anyway ;0) - right off the bat.  
&gt; &gt; Just posted my first file ever to the forum. Hope I&#x27;ve done it correctly.  Margaret
