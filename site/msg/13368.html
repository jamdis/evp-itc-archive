I found the book.

It is=
 called "The Diary and Sundry Observations of Thomas Alva Edison"=A0 the co=
pyright for the edition I have is 1948.=A0 Since only a limited number of 1=
st printings have Chapter 8, "The Realms Beyond", then I suspect 1948 would=
 be the date of the first printing.

Each chapter ends with the year Mr. Ed=
ison wrote it (it is primarily his diary).=A0 The part about spirit communi=
cation is dated 1922.

Obviously a 61 year old book is a bit fragile so I'l=
l start trying to scan those pages but I'm not going to hurt the book for i=

I suppose I just post them as JPGs in an email?=A0 There is not a place=

I have one of a handful of the Edison Autobiography t=

ly had that version of the biography recalled and reissued it without the l=

Anyway in this last chapter, Edison alludes to a way to commu=

 on how it could be done and the fact that the dead are just on a different=
 wavelength than the living.

Sorry, no links...=A0 This is from that old f=

I can tell you how to find your own copy =

I suppose ultimately, it doesn't really matter if Edison made =
a
telephone to the dead or not. Modern researchers in this field will
have =
to stand on their own results anyway, and if they've managed to
discover so=
mething that Edison never achieved, good for them!

I have also heard varie=
d claims: that Edison did make this box; that
Edison was working on it but =
never finished it; that Edison was joking
when he mentioned working on it. =
So for my own sake, I'd like to know
the real story.

If you have a link to=
 where you got your information from his
assistants and staff, I would real=
ly like to read it. Please make
sure it is as close to the source material =
as possible, and not
someone quoting someone quoting an article. For exampl=
e, here is a
link to the actual New York times article on Edison discussing=
 his
views of life after death: 
http://query. nytimes.com/ mem/archive- fr=
ee/pdf? _r=3D1&res=3D 9903EEDC1F39E333 A25751C0A9669D94 6196D6CF

That is t=
he kind of link I'd be hoping for regarding your statements.

Thanks for an=
