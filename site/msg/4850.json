I was verifying \ncommunication for others to hear.  So i used Babs as an example of an \nuncommon name as well as mine and bruce&#39;s name.  The first file \nprobably got lost on this board at this point with all the audio \nuploads recently....JULI !!!!!  Just kidding, but listen to the 2 new \nfiles from today in the folder and let me know what you guys think.  I \nalready know i have good communication with my two friends on the other \nside named Mike and Lisa, but i want to show others that what i get is \nreal.  If anybody wants to do a test session through Skype just e-mail \nme and we can set something up.\n\nThanx,\n-Steve H."}
