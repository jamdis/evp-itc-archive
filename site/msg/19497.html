Cheers to all,

Has anyone notice any type of increase of activi=
ty just before, during, and after an eclipse? Do you get better quality or =
more evp's during those times or is there no change? If so, what is the "wi=
ndow of opportunity" for using an eclipse for get paranormal activity, be i=
t video, radio, digital recorders, etc. for the eclipse (3 days before, 3 d=
ays after, etc.)?

Does an eclipse influence paranormal activity during tho=
se times? Any insight would greatly be appreciated.

CB
