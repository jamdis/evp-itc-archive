<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well when my friend first started getting Seth she was also getting 08
a lot, as well as hot and fell coming through a lot.

Why would this being gravitate to various Ovilus&#x27;? 

Has anyone got the word devil or the word graphines (whatever that
is)? I&#x27;ve had graphines come up many times, &quot;devil&quot; has come up once
and it was clear as could be but it really didn&#x27;t have any context. Weird.

&gt; - Hi Carol,
&gt; Hello Everyone,I am old to the site but new to posting messages. 
&gt; Things have been to busy around here 
&gt; 
&gt; I also have the Ovilus
&gt; &gt; I heard the names Seth, Amuel,Larry(Demon),Merrick, Samuel, Mott, 
&gt; Mel. I have the full name to the Seth person. He mentions several 
&gt; things so detailed. He also said he was from 1508 he fell, pain, hot, 
&gt; Also his last name is Saxton or he is from the town of Saxton in 
&gt; England?? He also said he was in my house behind me behind the couch. 
&gt; Have you been hearing the same words? I will try to post the session 
&gt; this weekend.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thank you  Maritza
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; I have a puck, and I have been getting the name Seth too.  I also 
&gt; have had
&gt; &gt; my puck give words that are not on the list.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m new here, but have been into paranormal research for 6 years 
&gt; now.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am the type of person that never gets EVP voices with a 
&gt; recorder so
&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought I would experiment with things like the Frank&#x27;s box and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ovilus. I recently got the ovilus and brought it to a cemetery and
&gt; &gt; &gt; field where a church burned down many years ago. I can not get too
&gt; &gt; &gt; specific without having people thinking I am making stuff up but 
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; got fairly wild towards the end of the session. For most of the 
&gt; time
&gt; &gt; &gt; we were there the Ovilus seemed to be spitting out a lot of random
&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff but it kept mentioning the name Seth. After we moved over 
&gt; to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; field where the church was, the ovilus got a lot more active and
&gt; &gt; &gt; started saying relevant words like cross and priest. The Ovilus 
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; &gt; MUCH more active when being used by our female member. Towards 
&gt; the end
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Ovilus said I am Seth, and the woman that was with me told 
&gt; Seth
&gt; &gt; &gt; that she did not want to talk to you I&#x27;ve heard bad things about 
&gt; you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; After that the Ovilus said rather nasty things to her and she 
&gt; started
&gt; &gt; &gt; feeling nauseous and she ripped the headphones off her head. 
&gt; Needless
&gt; &gt; &gt; to say we ended the session and got out of there.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Over the course of our investigation we found that the Ovilus was
&gt; &gt; &gt; saying many words that are not on the 500 word list, so yesterday 
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; did some test recordings to see what words would come up and one 
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the first things that came up was: seth  blamed  rest   I am   not
&gt; &gt; &gt; gare   demon (all in that order). Needless to say this has me
&gt; &gt; &gt; concerned that whatever seth is is still with the box so I am not 
&gt; even
&gt; &gt; &gt; storing this thing inside of my house. I have an MP3 of the ovilus
&gt; &gt; &gt; saying this.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also from my experience about 50% of the words it is saying 
&gt; aren&#x27;t on
&gt; &gt; &gt; the list. Chris Fleming has been getting words not on the list, 
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Barry FitzGerald has stated that just over 50% of the words he is
&gt; &gt; &gt; getting are not on the list. Is there really a much larger list 
&gt; than
&gt; &gt; &gt; advertised or is this thing really magic? Highly doubtful IMO.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; My most important question is is anyone else getting the name 
&gt; Seth out
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the Ovilus? How many people use this device here?
