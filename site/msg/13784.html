<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have had great luck with the Datak chemicals up to about 4 months ago. The
ER-71 photoresist and ER-8 developer did a fine job for boards I made
including some millimeter-wave circuits on 5 mil thick Duroid that required
tolerances to a couple thousandths of an inch.

However, either the quality control of Datak photoresist has gone to hell or
they changed it, because I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble getting even coats of it
on the boards with the newer ER-71. I asked them about it with no replies.

I&#x27;ve gotten lots of G-10/FR-4 board material of all sizes and thicknesses at
hamfests. It&#x27;s usually pretty cheap there. A couple years ago I got some
2-ft square pieces of .062 inch thick G-10, double-sided copper, for $3
apiece.

You can cut grooves in the copper with an X-Acto knife, making individual
pads on the board that work quite well. I&#x27;ve done that too.

&gt;  I really need to get a life! I never did have much luck trying to etch
&gt; boards, probably due to lack of a proper etching tank, but I just use a home
&gt; made wood chissle made out of a ground down saber saw blade to cut the
&gt; traces, or pads. This is actually faster than hand wiring a perf board--and
&gt; more reliable! I do use a drill press, and little micro drills, and if I
&gt; have enough area around a pad I use a dremel tool. This time I&#x27;ve leaving
&gt; out IC sockets, except for the function generator chip. My mother always
&gt; said I had the patience of a saint!
&gt;
&gt;  BTW, the copper board is from Radio Shack, seems like RS is the number one
&gt; supplier of EVP supplies.
