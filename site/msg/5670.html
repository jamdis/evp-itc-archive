Thanks Frank   Another path for me to take.  I keep trying.   I did almost as you discribed last night again with my EVP maker but didn't get anything.  Quite possibly I just can't hear good....which is a given.   Ron L

can be kinda distorted, as the raw audio is chopped up, and played back 
randomly. I save the session and export the aduio to the same folder as 
the session. I use an audio program to copy, and past out the phrases 
and messages. I don't use any filtering, but sometime will slow down 
the playback to make it easier. Sometimes the voices can be 
mulitlayered, which is confusing to listen to. Mostly, just follow the 
instructions! There is a manual that has to be downloaded seperately.
