I managed to pull out 1 file for you that i thought may be something.   I 
believe they say "Ask Bruce----Bruce"

I have posted a direct recording in my file under RS12-469 Direct  Recording. 
 This may be a good opportunity to get help with my technical  challange here 
in Mexico.  I have posted what I recorded from AM signals  along the beach 
here on the Gulf with the recorder patched directly into the  RS 12 469.  Most 
channels are Spanish language although one or two  channels skip across the 
Gulf fromTexas.  So you shouldn't hear many  English words from the radio if any.
 
I am submitting this because, with the help of this group, I recently  
learned that I have been missing all the messages on  my recordings.  That is...I 
couldn't hear anything where others with  experience hear plenty.
 
My previous post was with EVP maker.  If somethng could be heard on  the RS 
recording patched directly into my recorder that would be another  amazing 
event for me.  I of course hear nothing from the other  side.  Ron L
