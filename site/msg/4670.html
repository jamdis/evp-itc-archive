<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Okay, one of my DIY projects this weekend has been to convert my
husband&#x27;s old Olympus to infrared. We&#x27;re not extremely talented in the
electronics area, but we have fun and seem to muddle by. No guts no
glory, huh?

Well, for the most part the operation has been a success. I
photographed every step of the way and taped screws and parts to the
photos so we&#x27;d know how to rebuild everything we took apart, and that
has worked just fine. I located the IR filter, removed it and cut and
replaced it with a piece of glass slide. 

The one problem we ran into is that there were two wires that appeared
to be clipped in place as opposed to being soldered or screwed in like
everything else. When we tried to pry the clips open, instead the
whole thing came off the circuit board. WE HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO PROCEED
FROM HERE. I don&#x27;t know if we can just glue the darn things down and
if so, what type of glue to use, or if we&#x27;re just plain up the creek.

I immediately thought of this group of brainy electronics buffs. I&#x27;m
hoping someone out there can give us some advice, or if you live near
Highlands Ranch, CO, you could help in person &amp; bail us out of this. I
was hoping to take this camera to the St. Augustine Lighthouse at the
end of this coming week.

Is there any hope? I&#x27;ve posted a photo of an extreme closeup of the
clips (one is pink, the other is ivory) and the damaged board -- I had
to sandwich two photos together to get both in focus at the same time
(that&#x27;s why it looks that way). For an idea of scale, the clips are
both the same size, about 4 mm in width, 4 mm tall, 3 mm deep. Not
easy to handle and even harder to see with these middle age eyes.

Any advice would be GREATLY APPRECIATED!!  Deb T.</pre>
