Hi Kay,
 
That's all you needed to do was clip the mute wire and put it back  together. 
 The am does exactly as you say but still works fine.  I get  better 
communication on the fm band no matter what unit I use.  Good luck  and let us know 
your results.
 
Jeff

Did you hack your 12-820 radio? I just did a test on it and I  am not 
totally sure I did the hack right I couldnt find any instructions  so 
I just clipped the mute wire. eeeek!!! I still think the AM band is  
sweeping slower than it should it seems to stay one a station longer  
than it should. I am going to open it back up when I get home and 
take  a second look.
