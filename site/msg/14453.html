I would have to get along more with Jung's philosophies.

I do believe ulti=
mately that science and metaphysics all describe the same facts, just throu=
gh different colored glasses.
 
The problem with scientists is that they ig=
nore things they can't explain, such as the parapsychological areas, even t=
hough ESP and PK have been proven beyond mere chance.

Just because you don=
't understand something, can't dissect it under a microscope, doesn't mean =
it doesn't exist.

    Wait a minute...I see now why you were ta=
lking about "subconscious" as a term. It was because I said it was the scie=

 term. I just meant it was more of a tangible way of explaining it. I guess=
 the true scientific term would be your unconscious mind, or Feud's ID.

  Sorry, I had to mull it over a bit LOL!

        Science people will tell you there is no astral. =
The term "Astral" was coined by the first people who experienced this realm=
. But all words were coined. Even words such as dog or cat. 

        Also,=
 subconscious means below conscious or not conscious. So it isn't incorrect=

        You have to remember that colleges and schoo=

titutions are based on. They reject any term they can't grasp or understand=
 under a microscope.

        All this is besides the point though.
