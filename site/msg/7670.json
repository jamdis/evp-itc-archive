I never thought of boxes being used this way, especially \nto try and find missing and abducted children/people, etc, BEFORE \nthey are harmed.  What a great idea to discreetly work with law \nenforcement behind the scenes to see if it is viable.  ;)\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, juli velazquez &lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike,\n&gt;              I am an advocate for missing children.  I actually \nhave been testing all of the boxes out regarding this, backed up with \nfactual data.  I can tell you the results are amazing.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;              I would be more than happy to speak with you regarding \nthis off the board and share some of my clips if your interested.\n&gt;    \n&gt;              I will tell you, that the box will never be able to be \nused to prove a death or land a conviction, just like you can not \nhave a psychic testify in a court of law.   However, if something \nconcrete is received in a message or response, and does in fact \ncoincide with the coroner&#39;s inquest, autopsy reports and/or police \nreports I have in the past, noted the audio and documented it.  If it \ncould at lease point us in a direction where creditable evidence \ncould be gathered that could solve the case, or lead investigators \ndown the right path to bring the remains of the missing home, then \nthis could be a amazing thing.\n&gt;    \n&gt;              Right now as it stands, it is being look at as an \nadditional resource from a psychics perspective and noted just the \nsame.  Box communication for this purpose is so new, and most of time \nif you do not have access to the formal reports to back up the \nresponses, then you can not verify the messages from the other side \nnor can you actually trust that the information you are receiving is \ntruth.\n&gt;    \n&gt;               This is a very sensitive subject, and you would never \nwant to mislead the families as well as law enforcement on a wild \ngoose chase building up hope in the eyes of families who are will do \njust about anything to find answers and bring closure to grieve.\n&gt;    \n&gt;                I only work with law enforcement in what I do, and \nvery rarely do I ever work with the family.  If I have information \nregarding a case, I will submit it to the authorities and only then \nif something I provide strikes a cord to a case, it is up to them to \ncontact me for further information.\n&gt;    \n&gt;               I hope this answers some of your questions, for it \nseems we all have a common goal of utilizing our communication for \nthe greater good.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Juli\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael Edwards &lt;f1cracker75@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;             As most of you know, I am about two weeks old now in \nthis group, and I love it!  Very happy to be a part of this team of \npeople with like minded interests.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Have any of you used the Ghost boxes to assist with law \nenforcement agencies, and if so, how have they responded to any \nevidence you may have gathered from our spirit friends. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   I know psychics are already working with police agencies now \naround the world, but the Ghost box is a whole different method.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I know the media would have a field day with this, but I would be \ninterested if any of you have received messages that have assisted \nthe police in solving a crime.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Mike Edwards  Cary, NC\n&gt;     \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;   Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo! \nMobile.
