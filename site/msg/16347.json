I&#39;m 57, early-retired due to a disability, and have far more free time than I want or know what to do with. Which is what got me in trouble recently. After watching &quot;White Noise&quot; awhile back, one day I turned on a recorder and turned a radio tuner while asking if &quot;anyone&quot; would like to talk. To my great surprise, I found voices immediately after uploading and playing the file. I know about evps from watching the Ghost Hunters, but these voices were talking to me in a conversational tone and about stuff relational to questions I asked and to stuff I was doing at the time! This progressed over time into a running &quot;conversation&quot; with apparently living beings who are invisible but somehow sharing this house! Can someone here please relieve my anxiety a bit? I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m messing with something that I shouldn&#39;t be messing with. What are the consequences of this -- and can anyone enlighten me about the rules or protocol for dealing with these invisible people? And, has anyone found there is NO WAY to talk about this without sounding crazy??\n\nThanks,\nAl"}
