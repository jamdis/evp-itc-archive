<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>&quot;You all want to communicate with the other side, how about starting 
communication HERE on this side with each other.&quot;

That is the best statement I have ever read on this board and all of 
us could stand to soak it in and live it in our daily lives by 
example, myself included.  ;)

&gt; Hi guys. 
&gt;    
&gt;   Just got back today. Spent the last 2 nights trying to get my pc 
up and running so I could get back online, and came back to see some 
junk had transpired. A few of you seem to completely disagree, a few 
of you seem to wholeheartedly agree.... doesnt really matter with who 
you do or dont agree. I think thats about where we sit.
&gt;    
&gt;   As for Bruce, he has unjoined and can be found over on Jeremy&#x27;s 
group. Feel free to join him if you wish. Nobody will feel bad toward 
you if you do. A couple of you already have. As for his ban...never 
happened. He was just put on suspension for attacking members on and 
off the board, and I have to say it wasn&#x27;t cool at all what was said. 
Just very disappointing.
&gt;    
&gt;   I like Bruce, I think he CAN be a nice guy...I also know he can 
be quite nasty when he gets upset. Even he admits that. A few others 
here have that quality as well. Everyones human, we all make 
mistakes. I like everyone here, I just wish that you guys would show 
more respect for each other with your words. You all want to 
communicate with the other side, how about starting communication 
HERE on this side with each other. If you can improve that who knows 
maybe that link to the other side will improve as well?
&gt;    
&gt;   As for the mods, like it or not there are a couple of them. Since 
Frank S had some things going on and I work alot, two people were 
made mods simply to help out and allow people to join or approve spam 
posts when we arent around. They never thought they would have to 
deal with childish antics, in fact they didnt even have the ban 
buttons in operation. I thought we would never need that here. 
&gt;    
&gt;   They arent dictators, just people same as you and I. They havent 
banned anyone yet nor have I and its gotten pretty nasty here a few 
times and on any other group those involved would be kicked to the 
curb faster than you can say &quot;what happened&quot;.
&gt;    
&gt;   So to answer your questions, no Bruce was not banned, yes he was 
temporarily suspended from posting and yes he did exit voluntarily. 
And yes it is sad to see, very sad indeed.
&gt;    
&gt;   I cant control who says what, nor can I control thier actions, I 
can only try to control myself. If we all had a little more self 
control, conflicts like this wouldnt arise.
&gt;    
&gt;   For those who wanted my input, there ya go. Not much more I can 
say or do on this subject.
&gt;
