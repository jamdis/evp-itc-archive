<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Margaret,

Thanks so much, I was starting to wonder if the exclusion of non 
relevant data was handicapping me. I loaned out my shack hack for the 
night, but tomorrow I am going to try a session with clear intent, 
perhaps a meditation beforehand might help. I will definately focus 
more on specifics rather than a general q and a. Off to listen to more 
files...

thanks again
Andy

&gt; Hi Andy.  I know everyone doesn&#x27;t feel as I do, but I too disregard 
everything that isn&#x27;t 
&gt; relevant when I&#x27;m using any of the sweep methods.  As for any 
special practices, I find that 
&gt; the more clear I am with my intention for the session, usually the 
better results I get.  
&gt; 
&gt; Some of the criteria I use when deciding whether or not to accept 
content in a session as 
&gt; intentional communication is:
&gt; 
&gt; 	The spoken phrase is directly relevant to my preceding 
question or comment.  In 
&gt; some cases it is immediate, just as it would be in normal 
conversation.
&gt; 	The duration of the response spans at least one full cycle of 
the back/forth sweep, 
&gt; sometimes several.
&gt; 	The words are spoken in a single tone of voice.
&gt; 	The intonation and cadence are suggestive of that which is 
considered normal human 
&gt; speech pattern.
&gt; 	The validation by a loved one recognizing the voice and words.  
Though subjective, I 
&gt; find it persuasive.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have examples of various methods I&#x27;ve tried and explanations of 
the clips posted in my 
&gt; folder (Margaret Downey) here on the boards if you&#x27;d like to hear 
some of my results.  I&#x27;ve 
&gt; done a lot of work with the EVPM/allophones combo.

&gt; &gt; I am very intrigued at this idea, it seems to me that when using 
evp 
&gt; &gt; maker in this way it would be easier to detect if the allophone 
file 
&gt; &gt; has been manipulated to produce speech than with the shack box. 
&gt; &gt; Problem I am having (mental block)is that I discard any speech 
from 
&gt; &gt; the box that isn&#x27;t directly related to my questions as just part 
of 
&gt; &gt; the sweep and not part of the communication. I should probably 
relax 
&gt; &gt; and not try so hard, but...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am curious as to if any one has any special practices or tricks 
with 
&gt; &gt; this method that produces great results for them I eventually want 
to 
&gt; &gt; make a speakjet box (or more accurately beg my more electronically 
&gt; &gt; astute friends to build me one).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have been really enjoying the 469 shack hack method, and of the 
only 
&gt; &gt; two sessions I have done, one was uncannily accurate, while the 
other, 
&gt; &gt; well it was good experience :D
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance for the info...
&gt; &gt;
