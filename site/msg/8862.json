I hear beeps in\nyour recording that aren&#39;t part of the original allophones file I made.\nThe recording is also very loud and sounds distorted, and you didn&#39;t\nseem to have used the internal cue list of the file (if it was the\noriginal SJ-Allophones.wav file).\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; To Bruce, Stefan and others using EVPM. I have posted a file of my\n&gt; test with EVPM allaphones under ronriko files. I forward this for two\n&gt; reasons: the first as a request from Bruce to determine recurring\n&gt; words and second because I wanted to have experienced ears hear my\n&gt; recording for comments. Regarding the test, this is just 30 secs or so\n&gt; of a 7 minute recording. Recorded at 90% using EVPmaker with xcross. I\n&gt; was able to hear &quot;art and arthor&quot; a number of times within the 7\n&gt; minutes. This is after requesting no names be spoken.\n   \n&gt; Regarding my experiences with evpmaker and the allaphone file sent by\n&gt; Stefan, I must say my results have been underwhelming. I hear nothing\n&gt; but evp gibberish. I ask that anyone with an ear for this to give a\n&gt; listen and tell me if you hear anything intelligent. I am in a\n&gt; terrible radio zone here in Mexico so I have high hopes on EVP maker\n&gt; and the file Stefan provided. Also excited about the fact that so many\n&gt; others are getting excellent communications. Thank you to anyone who\n&gt; takes the time to listen to and confirm my recordings. I am beginning\n&gt; to feel like I am being blocked out like William had thought. Maybe I\n&gt; am in a true dead zone, no pun intended, or &quot;they&quot; don&#39;t want me in\n&gt; the loop for some reason. Ron L"}
