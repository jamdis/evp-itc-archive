    Wellll, I didn't realize, this is one that's even had a litter under t=
he grounds shed, and one of the guys used to bring it food and water, so no=
 wonder it's almost tame. Anyway, profound for me, I usually scare away chi=
ldren, women and animals. Hopefully it's not the usual eathquake sign, that=
 would be scary! If you look at the shadow guy image on the group home page=
, on his hat is wolf image, and this was just before that big Afghan quake,=
 plus it was showing up in the shower window--in the steam. I used to do Na=
tive American type stuff, so the totem stuff has meaning for me. 

  Angels=
 and Ghost has a psychic prediction page, and one they had listed, a soviet=
 plane crash just happened--Russian plane, but not it in Russia, and anothe=
r is similar to what I'm getting, a big tsunami for the east coast. I can't=
 get the guys to give me a straight answer as to what hits in August--if an=
ything.
