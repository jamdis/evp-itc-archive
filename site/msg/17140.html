<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s the Timex tuner, and AM is very noisy in my location. Plus I had a
white noise generator on the board to add noise to the radio audio.
 I&#x27;m gonna see iof I can remove the mechanical cap, and replace it with
tuing diodes in this older radio.

&gt;  Sounds good Frank. What radio did you use on this one? Most of what I
&gt; heard on the linear am seemed like it was coming through the white noise.
&gt; The random mode seems to work well, it sounded very clear.

&gt;  Wasn&#x27;t the definition of insanity--doing the same thing over and over an
&gt; expecting different results--? Random mode is a little fast, as I only have
&gt; one setting for it at the moment. There is a tiny amount of white noise
&gt; mixed with the audio, as if I need that here.
&gt;
&gt;  Linear aM seems to start out &quot;I will speak to---&quot; can&#x27;t make out the rest.
&gt; Then at 4 seconds &quot;this is good&quot;, they seem to make use of the white noise,
&gt; but this is only the first test.
