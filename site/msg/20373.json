It&#39;s basically the same as what they tell me, but they make no bones about it being 2012. &quot;They&quot; don&#39;t go into anything religous, nothing about only true believers being saved. Sometimes, but very rarely, I get that stuff like Astar command (channeled crap) how the ships will come and save everyone. I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath waiting! Same with the Jesus stuff. Change the names, but it&#39;s same story. I recommend everyone read the book &quot;Messagers of Deception&quot;, before believeing you&#39;re getting the absolute gospel truth. \n\n Yeah, some imply &quot;right now&quot;, other say 2012, other say like someday. \n\n If it&#39;s only for the righteous, ya won&#39;t see me in that number. I won&#39;t sell, or give my soul to anything, I don&#39;t care what they claim it is. \n\n Resurrection is just more of that ancient 5000 years plus old fear based guessing what some deity wants religion and people&#39;s fear of death. It&#39;s Zoroasterism, the roots of the bible go back that far, they even had the virgin birth, eons before Jesus. I think with EVP/paranormal we can see there is no death, so the resurrection thing, non-sensical. When there is 600 plus commandments, you can be sure it&#39;s a guessing game about what some deity wants. You can&#39;t think, you can&#39;t question, you have to fear wearing the wrong clothes--it stupid! \n\n &quot;they&quot; tell me that crap too about how I&#39;ll be transformed into  this woman they talk about--right!  Not holding my breath or selling my soul to be that. Wanting to be one gender or another is illogical, gender is for breeding, it has no other purpose. I won&#39;t play the ego game, and I&#39;ll do the void before I become an instrument of evil. I do not have to exist! \n\nF-S"}
