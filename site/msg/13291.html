I think they really are - isn't there some tone or range of sound that onl=
y kids can hear and shopowners use it to keep teens from hanging out there?=


I saw a show about it but can't remember what it is called now or why the=
y can hear it but most adults can't.

Most religions are based upon the idea that there is a higher power=

 is more than what the eye can see, more than what the ears can hear, is gi=

What they do with that is up to them individually.

I worry more about the =
kids who grow up with parents who are alchoholics, drug addicts, liars, thi=

As for if the effect is positive o=

 each individual whether it be ITC, religion, or life in general.
