I&#39;ve recorded somethings and had\nother people listen to them. I don&#39;t tell them what I\nthink it says. Sometimes they hear things I didn&#39;t\nhear. Sometimes they hear what I believed I did hear.\nI do log time dates location and moon cycles. weather\nconditions...And what I hear....\n\n   What is needed in my own opinion. Is the community\nneeds to stop all the childish infighting and be\nhonest with eachother. I think these methods do have\npotiential to be an asset to paranormal investigation.\nI feel that more research needs to be done and\nstandards need to be set. The only way this is going\nto happen is if we all work together. Putting our\npersonal feelings and beliefs aside. \n\n  I&#39;m stepping down from my soap box now. Thank you\nFrank for allowing me to join the group. I would like\nto get a Real Box so I can further contribute to this\nquest for knowledge......David\n--- Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Dah--FM --time for new keyboard, can&#39;t read the\n&gt; letters.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: evp-itc@yahoogroups.comFrom:\n&gt; franks-boxes@...: Wed, 28 Nov 2007\n&gt; 20:00:22 -0700Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] Re: ADDING TO\n&gt; THE IMPORTANT MESSAGE\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.

Isn&#39;t the idea of\n&gt; posting files to get different theories on what is\n&gt; heard? What are we comprehending in these or any\n&gt; other files anyway? We are just starting to break\n&gt; ground on full sentence answers, so we need to sift\n&gt; through them and make sense. That one about the\n&gt; earthquake is a great file, but what does it mean???\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t make any sense, we have to make sense of\n&gt; these files. Whether it be in reverse, enhancing the\n&gt; audio or whatever. This is our job as researchers,\n&gt; while they laugh their ass off on the other side\n&gt; watching us spend hours on the computer to say there\n&gt; is going to be an earthquake somewhere that doesn&#39;t\n&gt; happen. If they say &#39;Steve likes cupcakes in a tree\n&gt; in east asia&#39;, that&#39;s a great file and it will be\n&gt; clear. But what would it mean and what effect will\n&gt; it have on humanity.Nuff Said&#39;-Steve H.--- In\n&gt; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption\n&gt; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; That&#39;s the problem,\n&gt; get something that is not in human awareness to be\n&gt; recognized, heard, and comprehended.
