I do take it on investigations when I go on any though. \n\nI did one session in my car because a coworker wanted to contact her friend who had committed suicide. I haven&#39;t shared those files because she wants to keep it private, but we did get some good communication that night, and things were said that didn&#39;t make sense to me, but meant something to her.\n\nI try to do a session every other day, but have fallen behind a bit due to heavy holiday work load. \n\n~Draiga\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ursula&quot; &lt;kalinu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I was just wondering weather it be in your home in the park etc? and how often..\n&gt;"}
