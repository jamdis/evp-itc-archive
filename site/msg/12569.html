<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Another Great Video Mike, i wonder if all Sony radios work that way.  
A while back i used my Sony Walkman the same way, but i used a 
clothes pin to hold the button down.  That was model #SRF-M37V if 
anyone is interested, that model is available at most electronic 
store chains.  So, how&#x27;s the 470 hack coming???  I was thinking of 
giving that model another shot, but my local radio shack was out of 
stock yesterday.

&gt; Have you ever been called out to investigate paranormal activity 
&gt; happening in a shower, only when the water is running?
&gt; Or maybe to an area where it happens only when it rains. Don&#x27;t you 
wish 
&gt; you could have taken your ghost box out there with you, but were 
afraid 
&gt; it would get all wet and ruin the sensitive electronic circuitry?
&gt; Well... worry no more. Now you can take ghost box functionality 
with 
&gt; you when you&#x27;re all wet, or at least the environment you&#x27;re in is 
all 
&gt; wet. Now you can listen to those ghosts, singing in the shower.. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Here&#x27;s a video that shows you how to make a waterprroof SONY ICF-
S79V 
&gt; into a ghost box with non-stop sweeping audio.
