<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s the main draw back of the boxes, it relies on plenitful radio
stations for the raw audio. I think the entities know what they are working
with though for any given box/situation though.

A multi-turn rate control works really well, but those run about $15--or
more.

&gt; Hard to get a perfect sweep, because it&#x27;s constantly changing. A sweep may
&gt; be
&gt; good here at say setting #6 with 30 stations. But your sweep may be better
&gt; at
&gt; #8 with only 20 stations. Not to mention atmospheric conditions and whether
&gt; you
&gt; are inside or outside.
&gt;
&gt; If you think that would work well for you, just mark the spot with a dab of
&gt; white out. If the condition changes, you can always scratch it right off.

&gt; &gt; This morning I did some minimal testing of Chris&#x27;s Ghost Box 1 RS-12-589,
&gt; and I must say I did get some good messages, that were so clear that I did
&gt; not have to use Clear Voice at all on them. I actually tested it on a crime
&gt; case.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think I am going to really like this radio, but still have much more
&gt; testing to do before I start using it with my clients.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I sent Chris a note as I am still trying to figure out what the toggle
&gt; switch on top is for.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Chris if you see this note, please tell me what that toggle switch is,
&gt; and I have a suggestion for your next radio.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Steve Hultay you may need what I suggest too.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The silver dial that controls the speed of the scan, if you can add a
&gt; circle label underneath that displays 1/8 line increments in a circular
&gt; pattern, so we can turn the dial to each increment. What this will allow the
&gt; user to do is mark the line increment that works best for recording.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For me I need to be able to turn the device on and record for a client,
&gt; and it will be hard for me to try and find that sweet spot every time I
&gt; record.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am going to see if I can find or make a sticker to place under the
&gt; dial.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Again, so far I love it! Especially knowing I will likely not need to use
&gt; Clear Voice or any other software to bring clarity.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I will keep you informed.
