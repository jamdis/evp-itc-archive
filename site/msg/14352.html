Well, one of these days maybe, I wiill drive up there, I've never been  
there yet, I live in Clare/Farwell area so Old Mission is quite a clip  away.  
They use to have a very deep water area there, called it the  "devil's wash 
bowl,: my great, g. greandfather had a Cherry Grove up there, and  had a big 
white house, called the "summer house" it had pillars I have pictures  of 
it put away, they lived there in warm months of the year, I don't think they  
lived there all year long.  His name was Ep Ransom, he left the place to  
his son W.C. Ransom, then it went to R. Ransom the son, about that time we  
went into a depression, and Robert had money, but he ended up helping people, 
 and died before he ever got the money back, he was married to H. Ward, she 
 was my great grandma, on my mother's side, as a child I only heard the  
story's about the place, all I know is that it was very beautiful up there.  sf

I am wondering if that "child" like voice might have in fact been my  
mother?  Although, I could not hear the tape for some reason as it  did not come 
through, and I am having problems with Gold Wave so, I can't  filter out the 
static,  I have to learn how to operate these other  kind of recording 
software devices. My mother was born in 1927, and  her voice was really light, 
that's one thing our family has in common, the  women all seem to have the 
same type of voice, my daughter sounds, like me, my  cousin sounds like my 
daughter, my mother, grandmother, aunt, we kind of sound  much the same in tone 
and vocalization.  If I could hear that file,  I would know her voice.  
It's probably because of the ancestors, my  grandmother who was Ransom married 
a Stebbins, then 100 years before that  the geneology show's a Stebbins 
married to a Ransom, and this goes back, plus  A Ward/Ransom cross was there, 
and a Stuart/Stebbins, cross, and a  Stuart/Clark, so over the years this 
voice type or sound was kind of some how  got ingrained.  I am wondering if the 
1927 was my mom, her voice was very  light, and that year was very important 
to her, because when she was little  she as a baby crawed out on a pier, at 
a place back then called the "devils  wash bowl" it was where my great, 
great grandfather, a Ransom lived in  Old Misson, MI he had collie dogs, and 
had a big male called Tasso, when  mom as a baby fell in this very deep water 
he jumped in and pulled her to  shore, don't know how she managed to get out 
on that pier in the first place,  but she would have drowned if not for 
that dog.  So, September 4,1927  was/is her birth day, and in 1928 she almost 
drowned, at about 10 or  11 months old.sf
