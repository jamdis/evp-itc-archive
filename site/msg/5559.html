Carol, I guess my confusion is over how a ritual works to stop an entity in=
tent on causing harm.  I'm someone who prays and meditates often, but I won=
der if bad spirits are capable of disregarding the boundaries we set for th=
em.  I do know that when I told my threatening EVPer to go back outside it =
worked; in fact, I haven't been able to record ANY EVP in my house since th=
en.  I've never gotten the cursing so many people describe.  Besides having=
 a bad mouth, did the Waverly entity do other things?
