<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I would like to make all aware  that paranormal underworld no longer
exist, nor dose on line production .  This was my creation. I had the
idea and , brought it to the paranormal community . We have not done a
alive event in over 2 year. Nor has there been  attempt. It was a
great concept. But unfortunately  it never took off . I will not have
my name associated with something that boarders on fraud. 
    I am more than willing to share the temp plates , and the
technology, and what is needed at the location,  and how  I set this
up  for free .I will gladly explain  what server I used, and how to 
present a event what equipment  that is required, and how  it was
promoted ,  also I will tell you the problems I ran in to so you can
avoid them, as well as what I enjoyed about this,  my experience is at
your disposal, all I ask  for is a invite to the event .  
         If any one is interested you can contact me at
shadow71414@.... I will do my best to get back to you in 24
hours. Or I am more than willing to give my cell number out and I do
return calls promptly .

Joel Collins</pre>
