They looked rather unusual \nin the pics, so I was curious. I see from their datasheets that they \nare zener diodes - which was a surprise.\nA curious arrangement youve got for the circuit - certainly a radical \ndeparture from the traditional Raudive diode detector design.\nI think youre onto something with this application... Great discovery.\nI&#39;ll spend some more time with your file, and see if I can hear any \nother segments.\nregards,\nJEFF\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Jeff,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for sharing...\n&gt; The diodes are:\n&gt; Two in the plug tip circuit - 1N3020\n&gt; Two in he plug shield circuit - 1N3023\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike (UFO Geek)\n&gt; My Spiricomp ITC Systems configurations:\n&gt; http://www.ufogeek.com/spiricomp/spiricompsystems.JPG\n&gt; \n&gt;"}
