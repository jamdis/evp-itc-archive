<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s a really good antibiotic, and I get the store brand from 
Vitiamn Cottage. I get sinus infections often, and the Oregano clears 
it every time, usually just one or two doses. However, for chest 
pains, think ya might want to go get that checked.

&gt; I have never heard of Oil of Oregano.  What is it used for and 
where can you buy it?
&gt;   I had some bad chest pains is why I was feeling like shit.

be more

&gt; &gt; I will, I have had this since Monday, and my lady is the one 
&gt; pushing me to go.  I&#x27;m a man (maybe a stupid man) and the only 
&gt; reason I would go to the Doctor is if I&#x27;m kicking the bucket.  The 
&gt; only furneral I will go to is my own, and I&#x27;m not sure if I will 
&gt; even go to that one.lol  I&#x27;ll be ok, and thanks for the concerns.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  I also have acid reflux and it makes me miserable some times.  I 
&gt; take a Zantac and it goes away.  Thats just fine with me.

&gt; &gt; How could the breath air, their not supposed to have any lungs?
&gt; &gt; Who can tell what they have or don&#x27;t have.  Hell my chest has 
been 
&gt; hurting for some reason and if it doesn&#x27;t get any better I might be 
&gt; talking to you from the other side.  Time to go to the emergency 
&gt; room, but work comes first.
