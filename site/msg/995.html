&gt;Cool Frank! =) I know you can handle it more than you thought you could. As 
&gt;for the phone weirdness perhaps these are for you, named a bit improperly 
&gt;but I did it for good reason. Anyway there was one on the 31st about 
&gt;ringing but I dunno if I posted that one because I couldnt comprehend what 
&gt;they were talkin bout LOL.
&gt;
&gt;   Here ya go, have a listen when ya get a chance I think these are 4 you. 
&gt;Its a two parter but one clip goes into the other clip as u will see.

&gt;   Well, had a film crew, and interviewers at the house for almost three 
&gt;hours
&gt;yesterday. I was dreading it, didn&#x27;t really want to go through with it, but
&gt;as usual, not as a bad as I had imagined. We did run the box for the 
&gt;camera,
&gt;and &quot;they&quot; were talking, and saying names of at least some prestent. It&#x27;s
&gt;hard to catch it all live, so I hope it comes out on the video, and DVRs,
&gt;since the recordings were being done from monitor speaker on the box.
&gt;
&gt;It&#x27;s very hard for me to accept being the focus of this kind of attention,
&gt;but I don&#x27;t see the work stopping, so guess I best get used to it.
&gt;
&gt;Even my little Yorkie was fascinated, instead of being scared to death of
&gt;everything, he seemed to be very interestd in the cameras. Usually the dogs
&gt;bark and bark when someone strange comes in the house, none of them acted
&gt;thay way with this crew.
&gt;
&gt;Then there&#x27;s the phone wierdness, maybe realted? for the last couple week 
&gt;my
&gt;cell would ring about 2:30AM, blockled number, and no one on the it did 
&gt;that
&gt;last night, same thing. Then at about 4a, my phone rang, then my wifes cell
&gt;rang, then the house phone, all about a minute apart the last one, and the
&gt;same thing, blocked number. When it&#x27;s answered, it&#x27;s dead quiet.
