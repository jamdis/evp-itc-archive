<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Ron,

From the book, &quot;Voices from the Tapes&quot;:
&#x27; May it suffice to say that the experiments made with a diode were 
probably the best. Dr. Raudive&#x27;s diode which we had carefully 
examined and then had a replica built for the actual experiments, is 
basically a piece of germanium with some metal on it. It will conduct 
elecetricity one way and not the other. It is no more thatn what was 
known as the &quot;cat&#x27;s whisker&quot; in the crystal sets of early radio days. 
It acts in a similar way to a radio, but is not as sensative.&#x27;

It appears he received some good audio type signals using his Raudive 
Diode and his tape recorders, as the book illustrated throughout.

&gt; Hey Mike, I&#x27;m getting lost in your geekiness here. lol Can you 
tell me what I can do with this Raudive diode stuff. And, does this 
have anything to do with the light show. Ron

&gt; Greetings fellow researchers,
&gt; I built another Raudive Diode Device ( #3) this evening. This one 
can be used in two configurations.
&gt; 1) With the plug connected directly into the diode device and then 
into the recording device.
&gt; 2) The plug connected to a cable and that cable connected to the 
diode device. The cable provides some isolation between the diode 
device and the recording device.
&gt; I haven&#x27;t tested it yet... that will be done tomorrow or the next 
day.
&gt; You can see pictures and a schematic, here:
