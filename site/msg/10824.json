Often \nits not on the &quot;clearer&quot; ones that I think everyone will hear. \nSometimes we upload the clearest files and others dont hear it. That \ncan be for a number of reasons. Perception and equipment being used \nfor playback as well as individual hearing differs, etcetera. I know \nwhen I listen to my own files on different speakers or headphones the \nsound quality differs. It&#39;s just clearer on some than others.\n\nMisty\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;   No doubt, no one will hear the same thing I did.
