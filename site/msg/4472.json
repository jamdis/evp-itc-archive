Bruce, you&#39;re getting some awesome EVP&#39;s in real-time - \nanswering your questions! I&#39;m thrilled at your progress!            \nI&#39;ve gotten some saying my first and some saying my last names!!!! \nThat, convinces me it&#39;s not a radio station but actual \nvoices/EVP&#39;s!!!                 I just wish I could find some \ninexpensive amplified speakers for the RS 12-469 I have that could get \nthe volume up (with the speakers I have, I have to turn up the RS Hack \nvolume to max, to hear/record)!  The Philips Sterio speakers at Rite \nAid, ($13.) are round for PC, MP3, & CD&#39;s it says on the box, I&#39;m \nwondering IF I should get them to try out?     =Judy=\n&gt;"}
