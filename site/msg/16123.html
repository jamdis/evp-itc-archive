  File        : /Jim&#x27;s RR-DR60 EVP&#x27;s/I_dont_know-evp.mp3 
  Uploaded by : clockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt; 
  Description : My Cat (my best friend) was DOA to the Animal Rescue Leage here in town. IHe was missing for 4 days and on Friday I went to the pound and found that he had been struck by a car (the first night he didn&#x27;t come home). Severe spinal injury and they had to give him the shot. I asked about him (on the other side)...well seems like they don&#x27;t have the answers either. Glad tjey heard me though.....maybe he does too. Gonna miss him.
