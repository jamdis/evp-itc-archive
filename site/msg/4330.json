The water method. Recording water &quot;noise&quot; is how I got =\r\nmy first evp (i suppose) and has always been my base method, the one I retu=\r\nrn to. The fish tank in the room pumps water continuously thru the filter a=\r\nnd makes a small waterfall effect. The first evp was my mothers voice, a ha=\r\nppy/insane accident, the rest have been on purpose recordings.\n\n  I try alo=\r\nt of different methods, so far all are capable of yielding results but for =\r\nmy ears some methods are capable of better human voice quality tones, and l=\r\nonger sentence clarity. There is no perfect method. I dont think there is m=\r\neant to be a &quot;perfect&quot; method. If we knew everything there was to know, the=\r\nn what is there left to learn about hehehe\n\n  Most have success with the wa=\r\nter method, give it a try sometime. You can use the fishtank (if you have o=\r\nne) pump/filter from the other side of a room as background noise, or you c=\r\nan record while the shower runs, or the sink runs. Dont record too close to=\r\n the bg sound source. In this room I am about 14 feet away from the tank an=\r\nd I set my mics volume to 1/2 sound volume (thats 5 in audacity). Laura K. =\r\nrecorded her pool and a fountain in her house and had some good results. Fr=\r\nank R. also had success using this method. Charli&#39;s coffeepot had a similar=\r\n effect. It pumped the water thru a charcoal filter and they could hear voi=\r\nces emitting thru the noise.\n\n  It&#39;s interesting to me that some of the sam=\r\ne voices carry over no matter what method. Harsh noise, soft noise, no nois=\r\ne.... they still talk. Whether everyone hears them or not LOL\n\n  Test it ou=\r\nt =3D) The p1 filter for clearvoice was made for h2o, it does raise the lev=\r\nel of thier voices and clear up some of the static noise for me so I dont g=\r\net a headache listening. Use whatever works best for you.\n\n  Misty\n\n\n  psi_=\r\nresearch &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n    Misty, I may have missed an ea=\r\nrlier post, what&#39;s an H20 voice? -Bill\n\n    --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n    &gt;\n    &gt; Hiya Frank\n    &gt; \n    &gt; I =\r\ncan hear that.
