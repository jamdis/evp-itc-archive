<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I can hear that tho &quot;it&#x27;s fun&quot; isnt perfectly clear for me on the end

On the other one its pretty clear 
&quot;I&#x27;d like you to know YES&quot; is only difference I hear at beginning and 
at the end Coke-Cola in a singsong way on the end. I found this very 
interesting and a bit of a &quot;coincidence&quot; (if they exist) because last 
night I was just talking to some of the younger generation at work 
about marketing ploys people use and sometimes the advertising wars 
are just a scheme for both sides to make more money. One example I 
gave them was Coke vs Pepsi and they proceeded to ask what drinks 
were coke what were pepsi. 

I think you just took the taste challenge with the other side =)
