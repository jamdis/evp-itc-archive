<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello all! I have been a member of this group for a little while now, and I finally have a question..lol..

I have always been interested in EVP work, but have never really had the opportunity to &quot;try for myself&quot;...I am soo far from mechanically inclined it isn&#x27;t funny, and don&#x27;t have alot of money to spend...

Are there any suggestions on what I can do to start out maybe? Something cheap? That is easy to use? I have an old &#x27;Realistic&#x27;
cassette recorder with variable speech control ( pitch and speed controls)...is this anything that I can experiment with? Will it work (even for now until I can afford something better? lol)

Thanks in advance all!!</pre>
