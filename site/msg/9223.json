But there&#39;s enough Radio Shacks across the country that probably \nhave them.\n\nZack\n\nOn Tue, 8 Apr 2008, Frank Sumption wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hi Frank, I know a lot of us were waiting for you to chime in...... I was at 2 Radio Shacks tonight and there were a lot of 12-469&#39;s on the shelf there. If you need any just let me know. Jeff&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Mostly I was just kidding about y&#39;all buying up all the 469s. What I like about it, is using it as a tuner in a regular box, as I have yet to been able to make an FM receiver. I wish I had the funds to buy maybe ten of the radios, but I can only get one at time past the Ol&#39; Lady.\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Pack up or back up?use SkyDrive to transfer files or keep extra copies.
