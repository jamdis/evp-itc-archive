&gt;             I think its a bit of both actually. There are
&gt; many methods, many tools, and I would say the ghost box
&gt; devices are a great tool to use.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Heres one I recorded recently doing sweep tuning on my fm
&gt; card. Kind of pertains to this conversation and I was just
&gt; sharing it with a friend. Attaching it to this post its too
&gt; long of a filename wise to post here in file section. I
&gt; might upload it to my esnips for those who dont get
&gt; individual emails.

&gt; &gt; Hi Misty,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thank you for your suggestions. ..I would never have
&gt; thought
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; of that on my own! That would reduce all of the
&gt; &quot;ghost
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; phones&quot; to simply being tools rather than devices
&gt; to
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; communicate with a spirit.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; There is a small group of us (paranormal
&gt; investigators) in
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Muskegon, MI. We have had some interesting success
&gt; with
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; photographs. In a month I am taking them in an
&gt; entirely new
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; direction: using your body as a tool for ghost
&gt; hunting. And
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; not for protection, either! LOL. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This would fit right in with this idea of using some
&gt; sort
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; of white noise...even in the field.Or at least, it
&gt; will
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; give them something to really chew on!

&gt; &gt; Hi Misty
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You&#x27;re the only person I&#x27;ve heard mention
&gt; this, and
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; it makes me feel better knowing I&#x27;m not crazy (at
&gt; keast
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; totally). lol Long ago I noticed that running tap
&gt; water
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; sometimes seems to sound like garbled speech. I never
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; tested this with a recorder, but I&#x27;ve caught some
&gt; evps
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; with refrigerator motors and other devices. Audacity
&gt; has
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; the &quot;add white noise&quot; option, which allows
&gt; you to
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; record directly to your computer and allow the
&gt; entities to
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; organize the generic white noise. I&#x27;m eager to try
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; that. An excellent observation you had, Misty. I think
&gt; they
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; must grab hold of any babbling or whirring noise
&gt; available
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; to communicate, whether we&#x27;re able to pick it up
&gt; or
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; not. That&#x27;s why I carry around one of the
&gt; lightweight
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Olympus recorders -- no telling where you&#x27;re going
&gt; to
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; find a babbling-brook or steady motor sound. Good ear!
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sweep tuning can be used on AM FM shortwave etc. I
&gt; have had
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; some 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; success without tuning just allowing them to use the
&gt; static
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; or water 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; noise thats in background. Best advice one cold give
&gt; is try
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; it 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; yourself for a while and see what you come up with =)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Why do you need to &quot;sweep&quot; the AM

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone tried this but without sweeps on the
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; shortwave band? Has 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; any research been done? Could it be that the AM band
&gt; has
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; some sort 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; of &quot;special properties&quot; that would allow
&gt; such
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; communication? 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why is it that the AM band has to be used with a
&gt; radio
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; station 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; playing? There are parts of the spectrum that is just
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; outside of that 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; spectrum that might provide a better form of
&gt; communication.
