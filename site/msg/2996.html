Rod,
 
No disrespect but how do you know what ghosts have
the where with al=
l to do? I speak with them through frank and joe's box on a daily basis and=
 consider the
two that are communicating daily to be friends. I believe you=
 are speaking of grounded spirits not etherals 
and ghosts that are grounde=
d most definately interact with us. residual ghosts and hauntings do not th=
at is why
there is a distinction between the two intelligent and residual h=
auntings. but we are not talking generaly about 
haunting spirits that comm=
unicate through frank and joe's boxes, but all types of entities and don't =
call anyone 
dillusional unless you yourself have experienced your own rese=
arch with the boxes.

I certainly agree with the point of Bruces' statement,  but I fear he's =
being delusional about "friends" from the other side affecting some inter-a=
ction between a box and the user,  not letting one work,  the box chosing i=
t's owner,  etc., etc., etc.  In the first place Ghosts are Not our Friends=
!  That's pure, unadulterated Fantasy.
The Ghosts do not have the where-wit=
h-all to accomplish this in the first place, and even if they did they don'=
t give a rats' rear end what a Ghost Hunter does or doesn't do.  That boy r=
eally needs to get real.  Ghosts simply do not re-act to the living in that=
 way, or much of any other way except to allow us to see or hear them and t=
hen only when they want it to happen.  Their most obvious and biggest trait=
 is to be totally indifferent to our wishes.   Over 40 yrs. of Investigatin=
