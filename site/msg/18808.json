Oh but wait, we can&#39;t e-mail EVPs, unless it&#39;s from a POS digital\nrecorder. At 43 seconds &quot;Wilda she&#39;s back&quot;, that&#39;s my step mother in-law. At\n53 seconds &quot;Wormword coming now&quot;. The Stop file was right at the end, when I\nsignaled I was stopping, a woman said &quot;stop&quot;, but I almost cut her off.\n\n BTW, recorded on analog tape, with an analog tape deck!
