Below is a description of this meter, in case you haven&#39;t heard of it. Any thoughts on this meter?\n\nThanks,\nCountry\n\n&quot;&quot;&quot;The PX EMF meter is a talking ghost box which translate EMF signals into speech.  It uses an internal database of 2000+ words or can translate in Phonetic Mode speech which is not in the dictionary.  It also has a reverse Phonetic mode.  My favorite though is the Touch Mode.  In this mode, if the PX is left alone and someone or something touches it, it will start pinging like a deep sea submarine.\n\n1:  Dictionary Mode the PX has 2048 internal words that are used in this mode\n2:  Phonetic Mode the PX will use phonemes to speak \n3.  Reverse Phonetic Mode The PX will reverse the phonetic output in effect it talks backwards\n4.  Touch Mode this mode is used to detect if the device is being touched\n5.  Voice Change Mode, this mode is the same as #1 dictionary mode except the voice \n     can be altered detected inputs\n6.  Repeat Mode say last words said .. in this mode the PX will repeat the last words spoke from last said to  first \n    up to 400 words.  \n7.  Energy Mode : this mode allows the user to set the sensitivity of the device with one of 3 \n     preset levels. The PX will say LOW then give four beeps pressing mode during this time will set the Energy level low.&quot;&quot;&quot;"}
