This experiment asked for participants to determine what that=\r\n object was. Vague or partial answers would not be counted (for example, ju=\r\nst giving a color, shape, size,  what it&#39;s made of, etc): we&#39;re looking for=\r\n what it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#39;t cou=\r\nnt.  Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other me=\r\nans they chose.  \n\n \n\n In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the =\r\nobject at the start of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (R=\r\nJ folder) of this group.  The idea with this file is that you could downloa=\r\nd it at the beginning of the experiment and &#39;keep it safe&#39; on your computer=\r\n. Then at the end of the experiment, I would post the password so you can r=\r\neveal the contents of the file.
