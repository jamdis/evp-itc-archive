<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce.  I think it&#x27;s wonderful you we able to do this.  I also think it is totally different 
from contacting a complete stranger about whom you know absolutely nothing.  You had 
an &#x27;in&#x27; via someone who already knew the family.  As well, in this instance, we could be 
certain that the family was not only aware of EVP, but would gladly receive any messages.

Sarah has come through to a number of people.  Good to know her work continues from a 
new perspective.  Keep &#x27;em coming, Sarah!  :-)

&gt; Hey Mike,
&gt;  
&gt; I am the only one that I know of that has contacted the family
&gt; member of someone in spirit that I recieved communication from.
&gt;  
&gt; The spirit person was the renowned EVP pioneer Sarah Estep
&gt; I recieved contact from her within days of her transition.
&gt;  
&gt; At the time there was a board member here who was aquainted with
&gt; Ms. Estep in life and verified the recognition of her voice. They also 
&gt; informed me of her daughter and I was able to get in touch with her.
&gt;  
&gt; I sent her a CD of all the messages I recieved from her mother and
&gt; recieved a letter of thanks and her recognition of some of the phrases 
&gt; her mother had used in the messages. We still correspond from time to time
&gt; But I&#x27;m sorry to say I have not recieved any further communication from
&gt; Ms. Estep.

&gt; 
&gt; Amazing I take a weeks vacation and come back to 350 notes, and see this one.
&gt;  
&gt; Both of your arguments are indeed accurate. 
&gt;  
&gt; But it is an added bonus to the recipient or customer to hear their loved one&#x27;s voice on 
tape rather that by word of mouth from a gifted clairaudient, clairvoyant, psychic person. 
That is the icing on the cake.
&gt;  
&gt; What would bother me terribly is if any of us researchers received a message from a 
spirit in which we could actually make contact with their loved one to send the tape, and 
then to try and charge the contactee for the recording.  
&gt;  
&gt; In my opinion if any of us receive such a message with that clarity, we should send/give 
it to the contactee free of charge as doing so is in a sense a spiritual gift from the spirit to 
the contactee, and we are just the messenger.  I have been researching this concept, and I 
myself hope to one day be able to receive clear and concise messages which would enable 
me to contact the spirit&#x27;s loved one to give them that message should they wish to receive 
it. And I gurantee you it will be free of charge. 
&gt;  
&gt; Have any of you received on any occasion enough info from the spirits to be able to 
contact the loved one and give them the recording?

&gt; Jeremy,There will always be a market for less educated people and some to take 
advantage of that. There is a a saying out there---- &quot;Stupid people don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re 
stupid&quot;. How true is that.-Steve --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Early Cuyler 
&lt;ecuyler@ &gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Margaret, I can&#x27;t argue with what you&#x27;ve said. I&#x27;m just saying there 
are those who take advantage and should have no business in doing so. One example I 
can give is Chris Moon. He charges people to do box sessions. I can&#x27;t remember the exact 
fee, but it&#x27;s outrageous that he&#x27;s doing this, not to mention, he does so with a Frank&#x27;s box. 
He is a self proclaimed medium and I&#x27;ve heard from many sources that he is nothing but a 
fake. &gt; &gt; So I attribute my frustration with people of this type, but again I say, as long as 
there are people dumb enough to pay for this, then there will always be those who take 
advantage.&gt; &gt; Personally, I feel anyone who is gifted with mediumship or other advanced 
intuitive abilities should use it as a gift to help others, not for monetary gain.. I&#x27;m not 
being judgmental here, that&#x27;s just how I feel. I have a friend who is also a legitimate 
medium and I don&#x27;t agree that she should use her abilities for gain, but it doesn&#x27;t mean I 
like her any less. My not liking it won&#x27;t change the fact that it happens, it&#x27;s just the way 
things go. &gt; &gt; Do I think that Ron is taking advantage of people? No I don&#x27;t. Ron says he 
uses the best parts available and that the cost of the Minibox is very close to what it costs 
to manufacture it. How close, I have no idea. On the other hand, I don&#x27;t own one as I think 
$399 or $449 for the &quot;crystal enhanced version,&quot; is a lot to pay for a device that, from 
what I&#x27;ve heard, produces the same results as a Radio Shack radio for $25-$40. &gt; &gt;

[EVP-ITC] Re: boxes on ebay&gt; &gt; Hi Jeremy. If everyone knew about these support boards 
and that other resources are &gt; available to them, that would be one thing. Obviously 
everyone here is aware of that. But &gt; not everyone knows this place exists. &gt; &gt; And even if 
they do know about the boards here, how many would have the nerve to ask &gt; for help 
from strangers? As Bruce recently shared, he gives people invitations to contact &gt; him 
privately in case they are too shy just ask a question publicly. Which means, by the &gt; way, 
to some degree they have overcome some of that shyness in order to post whatever it &gt; 
was to begin with, which inspired him to make this offer. What if they don&#x27;t even have the 
&gt; gumption to be anything more than be a look-i-loo?&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m guessing many people are 
just surfing the net, checking out paranormal stuff, and run &gt; across the hacked boxes 
for sale. &gt; &gt; Again, I ask people who are taking the position you and Bruce are regarding 
profits ... do &gt; you have this same harsh sentiment toward Ron Ricketts, who makes and 
sells the &gt; MiniBoxes? I realize he is passionate about this research and helping others. 
Does that &gt; give him amnesty for making a profit? &gt; &gt; Personally I think we need to not 
be so judgmental. At what point does &quot;profitable gain in &gt; the paranormal field&quot; become 
&quot;sickening?&quot; I have a friend who is a medium. I mean THE &gt; REAL DEAL. He charges for his 
services. The fee is reasonable compared to many in his &gt; field. Does he do this because 
he&#x27;s a terrible person looking to take advantage of people? &gt; NO, he does so because he 
has been given a gift that changes people&#x27;s lives for the better. &gt; But he has to make a 
living.... has to support himself in some way. And because he has &gt; chosen to provide this 
service full time (and is not a trust fund baby), he makes a profit. &gt; This allows him to 
help far more people than he could if working some other kind of job &gt; and providing his 
services at no cost on the side. &gt; &gt; I realize this is not exactly the same thing as gouging 
people on the price for a &gt; commercially available product, but making such blanket 
statements about profitability in &gt; the paranormal field being sickening is rather short-
sighted, in my opinion. &gt; &gt; I have a southern friend who likes to say, &quot;It&#x27;s a mighty thin 
plank that ain&#x27;t got two sides.&quot; &gt; I just don&#x27;t think we have the right to claim that simply 
because someone is offering a &gt; good and or service for profit to consumers in the 
paranormal market, that this &gt; automatically means they are taking advantage of other&#x27;s 
vulnerabilities. &gt; &gt; For Pete&#x27;s sake, no one is twisting the people&#x27;s arms to buy those units 
on eBay. They are &gt; perfectly free to buy from whatever source they choose. Since the 
units do work as &gt; claimed, we can argue that people have overpaid, shopped unwisely, or 
whatever. I assure &gt; you this happens every single day throughout the retail market place 
with all types of &gt; products and services. &gt; &gt; I will say I have a fairly heathy dose of 
distain for charlatans/scam artists (of any flavor in &gt; any field) but that is not what we are 
talking about here. We are talking about people who &gt; are offering legitimate products to 
consumers. I&#x27;d rather see people doing this for profit, &gt; even when obscene, than running 
scams that damage people&#x27;s physical, mental, and/or &gt; financial well-being. &gt; &gt;

Very well put, Bruce. Profitable gain in the paranormal field is sickening.. Unfortunately, &gt; 
there are those who continue to support the ones profiting, so it will continue. It makes &gt; 
me sick that people take advantage of others vulnerabilities, especially when it comes to &gt; 
spiritual matters, but that&#x27;s a rant for another time and place.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If someone is afraid 
to try hacking a radio or lacks the proper tools, they are more than &gt; welcome to send 
them to me and I&#x27;ll do it for them and ship it back. As Bruce said, it&#x27;s not &gt; for 
recognition, but it&#x27;s to help further the research. I wouldn&#x27;t be doing this research if it &gt; 
wasn&#x27;t for Frank, Bruce, Steve and the others who put in their time and effort. The &gt; 
possibilities are only limited by our willingness to work together. The more we work &gt;
