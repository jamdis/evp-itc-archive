Given the file folder shortage, I deleted all of my files to give the new comers room.  I hated to do that, given if anyone wanted to revert back to my clips, they could in fact do so and now that can&#39;t.   I also hate to have to send someone a link to find my audio on an additional sight.  \n   \n              Maybe we could comprise and say after &quot;x&quot; amount of days, upon new files being uploaded we could clean house?  I know that not everyone will take it upon themselves to do this, but if they don&#39;t (after an announcement from the groups caretakers), if they disappear, its their own fault.\n   \n               I personally like the single emails announcing each file.  I can go straight to the audio clip and not have to search through previous clips I have already listened to.  \n   \n  Just my thoughts!\n  Juli  \n\nbhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n          Yesterday I decided to post some files so I posted to a sub folder of \nmy main folder in the files section.\nI noticed that some people voiced their dislike of sending post notices \nfor every file , so I sent none.
