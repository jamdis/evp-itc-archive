Wait a minute...I see now why you were  tal=
king about "subconscious" as a 
term. It was because I said it was the  sci=
entific term for the astral. So 
yes, your right, it wasn't a true  scienti=
fic term. I just meant it was more 
of a tangible way of explaining it.  I =
guess the true scientific term would 
be your unconscious mind, or Feud's  =
ID.
 
Sorry, I had to mull it over a bit  LOL!

Science people will tell you there  is no astral. =
The term "Astral" was 
coined by the first people who  experienced this rea=
lm. But all words were 
coined. Even words such as  dog or cat. 
 
Also, su=
bconscious means below  conscious or not conscious. So it isn't 
incorrect,=
 though maybe some  scholarly types will tell you it isn't proper. 
Again, =
all words were  coined.
 
You have to remember that colleges and  schools a=

people, people who think only  scientifically. I know=

reject any term they  can't grasp or understa=

All this is besides the point  though.
