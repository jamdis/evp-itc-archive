I think that is a good idea.  They seem to be very aware of what is going on in our lives.  Therefore, why not try it!

I know you&#39;ll put it to good use and be highly rewarded.  \n   \n  I&#39;m going to listen to my radios simultaneously right now.. just listen with my eyes closed for a few minutes.  I tried doing this last night but promptly fell asleep!  I have my recorder with me too but think I won&#39;t turn it on right now.  I wonder if it helps to ask questions BEFORE you actually start recording.  I used to do that when trying to get regular ol&#39; EVP.\n   \n  Robin\n   \n    ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Jules \n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 7:27 AM\n  Subject: [EVP-ITC] Frank&#39;s Box #12\n  \n\n    I am proud to announce that yesterday I became the bran new owner of \nFranks Box #12.

I know its hard trying to stop \nyourself from asking questions, but let them have their time as well, \nfor the communication should not be one sided, us always wanting \nsomething from them to be answered. If they want you to jump in and \nanswer one of their questions, believe me they let you know (see my \nfile, lets get started).\n\nI have come to realize that many messages are missing when you jump \nthe gun trying to start that immediate two way communication, or you \nstart talking over them, not allowing clear audio to be received. \nTherefore, I would highly suggest trying this as well, you just may \nbe surpised what you get!\n\nAdditionally, I have also observed that when tuning in the boxes, \nplay close attention,they may just give you directions, you don&#39;t \nhave to have the conversation going.
