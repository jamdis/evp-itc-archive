<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This looks like another person with a huge ego but lacking intelligence who
has a voice to the world over Internet that she wouldn&#x27;t have had 30 years
ago.

I find her attitude irritating. Yes, anything can be faked. A photo, an
audio recording, a driver&#x27;s license can all be faked. But does that mean
that ALL photos, audio recordings and driver&#x27;s licenses are fakes? A person
who accuses others of misdeeds is often found guilty of the same misdeeds.
Maybe we&#x27;d better have a look at her driver&#x27;s license.

I can often hear things in recordings that others can&#x27;t. It comes from years
as a radio amateur trying to hear extremely weak signals in extremely noisy
backgrounds. This includes EME (Earth-Moon-Earth) which can be some of the
most difficult to hear. I heard things in some recordings I made at a
haunted place and sent them to some other people. They couldn&#x27;t hear them.

Having said that, I&#x27;m not a fan of &quot;orbs.&quot; I spent a lot of time exploring
how to get photos of &quot;orbs&quot; with a digital camera with flash. I&#x27;d say 99.9%
of the orb photos are due to natural causes. There IS that 0.1% I can&#x27;t
explain, though.

Anyway, Happy New Year to all!

&gt;  I was lead to believe this person had an interset in the box, and she
&gt; brought her &quot;boyfirend&quot; that just happen to be local, to our meeting the
&gt; other day. I let them &quot;barrow&quot; #63, now  I&#x27;m sure she will claim she tested
&gt; the box &quot;scientifically, and can prove it does not work.
&gt;
&gt;  Karen had contacted me via e-mail requesting a meeting. I thought she was
&gt; someone off the group and has an interest in EVP and the boxes. She did
&gt; mention she was a skeptic, but I didn&#x27;t think debunker, or a professional
&gt; skeptic--wonder who pays these twits?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  These skeptics don&#x27;t allow themselves to hear anything, yet will proclaim
&gt; that as proof the boxes and EVP don&#x27;t work, as if their hearing is somehow
&gt; better than the average persons ear. If a person doesn&#x27;t want to hear it,
&gt; they won&#x27;t, and because they can&#x27;&#x27;t hear EVP that means no one else an
&gt; either.  Yeah, real scientific!

&gt;  Gonna have to remember Google-googel-google!!
