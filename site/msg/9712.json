This is a common item at Radio Shack.  I think you are \nlooking for 1/8&quot; male \n&gt; connectors on both ends.  It runs about $5.  Do you have a store \nyou can walk into?

Just use \nthe patch cord I \n&gt; described in my previous response ... connect it from the \n&gt; &gt; headphone jack on the recorder to the mic jack on your computer. \nOpen Audacity (or \n&gt; &gt; whatever), hit the record button, then hit the play button on \nthe recorder to play the \n&gt; &gt; session into the computer. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When you&#39;re done, press the stop button on the recording \nsoftware, the stop button on \n&gt; &gt; the recorder itself, and then save your session. From there, you \ncan begin to work with \n&gt; it, \n&gt; &gt; without worry of losing any data. Just be sure when you close \nthe file DON&#39;T SAVE \n&gt; &gt; CHANGES on the original, so you always have the raw version to \nrefer back to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can do this same thing with any recorder that has an \nearphone jack. Just go with the \n&gt; &gt; one you are drawn to. There are a bunch of them on eBay. If you \nare doing sweep, you \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t even need a digital recorder, just plug in a mic into your \ncomputer and record on \n&gt; it. \n&gt; &gt; This saves you all the time and hassle of moving the file from \nthe recorder into your \n&gt; &gt; computer. That&#39;s what I do. You really only need a digital \nrecorder for traditional work \n&gt; or \n&gt; &gt; portability (unless you have a laptop, which is pretty easy to \ntake with you.) :-)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Margaret\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Can anyone tell what would be the best way to transfer a \nsession I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; recorded on an older microcassette recorder to my computer? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I did my first recorded session last night. All went great \nexcept for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the lousy reception. I didn&#39;t realize just how much you miss \nduring a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; real time session when you play back what you recorded. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I got two different Steve&#39;s one sounded Australian and a Mike. \nI also \n&gt; &gt; &gt; got the number &quot;Seven&quot; I am sure there is lots more there but \nmy \n&gt; &gt; &gt; reception was so bad I can&#39;t hear everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also what would be a good digital recorder (relatively cheap) \nto get \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that you can easily transfer to your computer?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Any help would be appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kay\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
