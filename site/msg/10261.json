Let the friggin&#39; entities talk, and you might get \nsomething more meaningful, but then that wouldn&#39;t justify the ego \ncrap, and the so called theories, and paranormal expertise.  So what \ngood is it doing to ask all the &quot;right&quot; questions when you get vague \njunk back!? You have to let go the presumptions, and everything you \nthink you know. \n\n What makes you two(Steve and Bruce) think you are so special that \nyou can get the answers to technology questions when they don&#39;t even \ntell me, Stefan, Bill, Ron, or any physical techs anything! At least \nwe could implement any technical suggestions. Y&#39;all wouldn&#39;t know \nmicrofarad from a microbus(VW). \n\n I think your guides quit talking cuz you&#39;re both are ego tripping \ninto outter space. Yet you&#39;re pissed cuz I wouldn&#39;t allow myself to \nobligated to you for &quot;donations&quot;. \n\n I been tryin&#39; to hold back, but this girl&#39;s still got hair trigger!\n\n So &#39;nuff public venting!\n\n Frank-S"}
