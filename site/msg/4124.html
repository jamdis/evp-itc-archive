Hi April   Can you be more specific on the "marked differences"   ron

:) I think it is fantastic that people are acquiring all sorts of
devices and techniques in this field. Yes, the RS Hack is $24.95 (a
huge difference in price from the $399 for the mini). But, considering
the amount of work that goes into the production of the Mini (not as
simple as just an AM radio, quite a bit of engineering went into the
design and they are hand assembled) it is more than reasonable. They
are marked differences in performance (in my experience).

I am not speaking for Frank, but I think he is pretty supportive of
all of the new technology. It's exciting to see so many people coming
together and working toward positive spirit communication.

Just my two cents :-)
