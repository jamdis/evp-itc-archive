Subject: [EVP-ITC] Intro and question

Greetings all! I rece=
ntly joined the group after becoming very interested in EVP and basically 
=
the whole idea of after death communication. Thus far I have only used a di=
gital recorder to 
record at random times during trips to cemeteries etc. w=
ithout success.Now I would like to 
try some more controlled efforts as far=
 as set times, set questions and have purchased a 
hacked radioshack 12-469=
? 

My questions if anyone can help

my hacked radio has no external speake=
r only a place for earbuds, is there some kind of a 
cord or connecter I ca=
n get that will hook it to a external speaker? how about some kind of 
cord=
 to hook it to a digital reorder..or a spit cord to do both?? I am very, ve=
ry electroncially 
challenged so do these exists?? what are they called? an=
d where can I buy them?

my next question has to do with attempting to reco=
rd EVP , anything you have noted which 
seems to encourage success?

thanks=
 in advance!
