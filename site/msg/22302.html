Seems the angels are looking for lost people over there in the lower  
darkened plains, other's in lower plains seem to want to hold on to them, but,  
in the last file it sounds like a group of angels are telling some one, the  
"Don't marvel where they or we found him, Patrick's  through won't  give 
back"  They are also talking about a guy they call, "Joe" that he is  not a 
slave" "he transferred"  Joe must have got into the light too.   sf
