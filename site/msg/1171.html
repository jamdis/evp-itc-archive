that sounds very plausible to me  there are undoubtedly all kinds of related matters that we cannot know at this stage and will not know if every reasonable possibility is not considered.
   
  btw, no matter how you wire up a mrf901 to function as spook detector, it functions as a common-collector amp with a dc short across input AND functioning in regen mode just on the verge of oscillation.  when voices break in it jumps to a spot between regen and superregen where loud , distorted voices come in that are not radio crossmod.  all bipolar transistors have greatly extended high frequency capability in common-collector mode compared to common emitter common base.  voltage amplification must , obviously, be by output transformer with extra low primary impedance at audio frequencies.
   
  the spook radio "eats" EFI, RFI and converts it to signal.; the computer and keyboard RFI is reduced to faint white noise.  many other interfering junksignals are reduced and the irreducible residue is uniform spread spectrum white noise.
   
  thats very good for detecting weak signals in an electrically noisy environment

Yeah, weird how the "box", or the entities that come through have their 
groups too. I guess they have to set their vibration to the user. It could 
mean what Chris gets is valid for his group, I just don't happen to agree 
with it, hopefully I'm not being an ego jerk.
