<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I would like to express my profound condolences to the family and 
friends of Sarah Estep. 

Although I am not saddened by her crossing, because I know she will 
have a special seat at the table.

I did not know Ms. Estep personally but I knew of her and her 
accomplishments in the field of EVP.

She was a trail blazing pioneer that forged a way of light for all that 
would follow. She and her wisdom will be sorely missed.

I&#x27;m sure that we have not heard the last from this amazing woman.
