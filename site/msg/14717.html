Well, everything is done for a reason, I believe this gift of communication 
 has been given to us for a reason, not just to sell tickets, but to help  
ourselves still in the world, by moving those other's on, we in a sense  
move ourselves on to better and higher vibration.

We all have our own beliefs. I make no judgements on the living or the  
dead. I just communicate and record. I am an Empath, not a priest. Many,many  
spirits have asked me for help. If they can help themselves, they do not seem 
 to know how. The prisoners believe that they would be trapped. if they 
died  there. Are they imprisoned by their own beliefs?

In a way, I agree. "Stuck" implies  accidental. If a ghost is hanging 
around, it there by choice, whether it is  fully aware of that or not.

I don't believe in trapped/lost souls, I think that's  Hollywood. The 
trouble with doing investigations, I think, is you get  the evidence you expect 
to get, so it will tend to support the concept of  stuck souls. When I record 
it supports my concept of sprits travel, and  hauntings are for show. Which 
is correct?--both at one time or another.  

I did a recording at lunch time, at home, and in it a voice says  
"ghost--right behind you". I was recording open air with the test board  running.

Well, stand outside the thing, and help  those poor souls out, here they 
are making money at the cost of lost souls  who are asking for help.  Shame on 
them, don't they realize  how  many lost souls there are out there, 
waiting, go back (a few thousand  years worth of them,)  were I to name all the 
tribes, country,  religions, throughout the years, people that died trapped, in 
various  places over century's, and yes there are thousand's of them in the 
world,  just dwelling in a cell of their own making, no progression, no 
light, no  hope, without people they love, and who wait still loving them, they 
 exist in these dark places without God.  This mission should be to  help 
them get back to God, back to the light of God, light of Universe  however, 
we want to call it, but in that light is love and  happiness.  Just my take,

Yes, you need special permission. I was there for an all night  ghost hunt 
as a guest of Eastern Paranormal. The place can be rented at  night but 
believe me when I say "it ain't cheap". Plus I don't think the  prison would 
appreciate me releasing the inmates before their  eternal sentence has been 
served..

Does one need special permission to get in  there?  You folks should go 
back, and release them since a few of  them already know you Steve, this is 
Steve?  Right?   sf

Unfortunately I did not get to attempt to cross them. After my  
demonstration, another group that was also there started complaining  that the box made 
too much noise and was hendering their investigation  so I turned it off. I 
wouldn't want my direct communication with  the deceased inmates to mess up 
their EVP work, now would I? I  apoligized and put it away for the rest of 
the night.
 According to the prison staff, the inmates firmly believed  that if they 
died in prison their souls would be forever trapped  there. This belief was 
so strong that the prison officials would take  the elderly inmates who were 
dying of natural causes  to a local hospital so they would'nt have to die in 
the  prison. Maybe their beliefs were well founded.

This is a wonderful recording, were  you able to free any of them?  So sad 
to see them still there  behind bars, must be very lonely for them, they 
should be moving on  so, they can start to work on making up for things on the 
other  side.  You folks should go up there again, and hold a small  prayer 
vigil for them, of course they would no longer be ghosts  trapped there, but 
there are plenty more around.  sf

I was invited to spend the night in the West Virginia  Penitentiary this 
past weekend... I was asked to give a short  demonstration with my Optimus 
12-797 hacked radio. Deep inside the  prison surrounded by concrete and steel, 
the radio could not pick up  any radio stations in manual mode. I wasn't 
sure how this might  effect the demonstration. I was pleasantly surprised with 
the  results. I recorded the session and the results can be heard at this  
link. _http://www.youtube. com/watch?  v=KwDYu4RULlk_

         <P>I was invited to spend the night in the West Virginia 
        =
    Penitentiary this past weekend... I was asked to give a short 
        =
    demonstration with my Optimus 12-797 hacked radio. Deep inside the 
   =
         prison surrounded by concrete and steel, the radio could not pick =
up 
            any radio stations in manual mode. I wasn't sure how this m=
ight 
            effect the demonstration. I was pleasantly surprised with=
 the 
            results. I recorded the session and the results can be he=
