&gt;           Hey.. it was my honor and pleasure to have our very own 
Bruce Halliday 
&gt; on my Ghost to Ghost PM internet radio show tonight.
&gt; Bruce has helped many of us here, and was kind enough to give me 2 
&gt; hours of his time. You can hear that show here:

&gt; It will begin playing automatically once you are on the website.
