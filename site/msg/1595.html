<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ok, it wasn&#x27;t directed at you personally as you are not the only one 
asking for a box.  I offered you my version of the box even though i 
don&#x27;t know you and i paid to have it built, but you wouldn&#x27;t drive 
15-20 minutes away to come get it.  Let me post a bit of your e-mail 
from back in march about the box.
You Wrote:

I took a look at the schematics for the box you mentioned and all it 
is is a white noise transever. it collects a signal and emmits white 
noise in actuality it is an am radio tuned to an off station. a 
radio shack hand held transister radio will do exactly the same 
thing. I do extensive evp research and you will never hear a spirit 
voice just because you are listening to white noise or any other 
color noise for that matter if you can hear a spirit voice without 
the aid of a voice recorder then the spirit is capable of forming 
the voice in the first place and you would hear it without any 
assistance. most spirit voices are captured as evp on recorders and 
even then need some editing help most of the time to decifer them, I 
have heard voices of spirits at investigation locations with my 
naked ear and caught it on the recorder as well. so if your gonna 
hear them your gonna hear them !
__________________________

Does that sound familiar?  I guess i was more interested than you 
huh?  Shot it right down and made fun of the idea, so i guess a 
person who doesn&#x27;t believe in the box should get one...your right.  
I was interested in doing investigations and needed a team to join 
to gain experience and that&#x27;s why i contacted you.  As far as 
ripping off Frank&#x27;s design, i don&#x27;t even know his design to begin 
with.  I&#x27;m not an engineer, i was just looking for help just like 
everyone else and happened to find it.  And i even gave you my 
contact for my box.  Different box and different results, not a rip 
off it&#x27;s just another persons idea and that&#x27;s what this about.  I&#x27;m 
sorry i don&#x27;t have all your experience, i&#x27;m only 33 and just have 
recently started documenting stuff.  And my web site i built myself 
and am pretty proud of it.  All the EVP&#x27;s on there are from the past 
month and a half of research.  I&#x27;m sorry you don&#x27;t get results like 
that, that&#x27;s not my fault.

I&#x27;m sorry Misty, but i had to defend myself.  I was trying to get 
the board back to what it was meant to be, peoples research and 
different ideas and not how many times we can ask Frank for a box.

&gt; Steve,
&gt; I know that your post about &quot;begging for a box&quot; was directed at 
me. 
&gt; Frankly I am insulted, I thought we had developed a somewhat off 
the 
&gt; group friendship. Your response to my post to frank for a box was 
not 
&gt; begging but I believe that your obvious attempt at ass kissing is 
&gt; more insulting to frank than my asking for a box. it seems to me 
that 
&gt; you are afraid that I may get a box before you do and that for 
some 
&gt; reason you deserve one more than anyone else. I don&#x27;t understand 
that 
&gt; being you already ripped off franks design and had some one build 
you 
&gt; a number of boxes on your own. As far as serious evp research goes 
I 
&gt; have dedicated many many hours, much more than you have I&#x27;m sure 
to 
&gt; evp research and other forms of itc. matter of fact if anyone 
takes a 
&gt; look at your site the couple of dust orb pictures you have and the 
&gt; only evps I have heard are recent ones gleaned from the boxes you 
had 
&gt; made do not make you a dedicated seasoned pro at PI. I also 
remember 
&gt; not long ago you contacting me for advice and asking to join my 
team 
&gt; so in some way you must have recognised my professionalism. I will 
&gt; end by saying, If you want a box from frank be honest and ask like 
I 
&gt; did instead of trying to cuddle up next to him with your own 
version 
&gt; of his box and make it like you care about his feelings or 
protecting 
&gt; him from any annoyances. who made you the frank police anyway. 
steve 
&gt; just be real lets all work together and help each other do not try 
to 
&gt; sabotage anyone else hoping to further your own ambitions, you 
work 
&gt; with auto parts all day while I am doing evp research so you tell 
me 
&gt; who is more qualified to work with the box me or you?
&gt; 
&gt; I hope I didn&#x27;t piss anybody off this is just my opinion!
