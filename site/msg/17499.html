<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank,

Yeah, you do get them talking about you.  It seems like there is a lot of conversation between many voices here and they are talking about calling.  At .08, somebody is tee&#x27;d off.  

There is something to labeling affecting subliminal interpretation.  When I read your interpretation of the &quot;jesus&quot; line at the beginning, that is what I heard through the speakers first and foremost.  I turned the speakers off and used studio grade headphones for analysis.  Voila, no Jesus.  I guess he was resurrected from this clip!  I often wonder if the sound waves between speaker and listener are manipulated in some way.  This is why I like to listen in enclosed headphones, that way your ear is directly against the sound source.

That said, this is what I hear from your clip:

@.01: &quot;He&#x27;s calling you, he&#x27;s a (unclear)&quot; (male, electronic)
@.03: It amounts to scheisse
@.05: &quot;Make sure he has the date&quot; (male)
@.06: &quot;May Eighteenth&quot; (electronic)
@.08: &quot;Fuck this guy&quot; (male)
@.09: Singing - &quot;He doesn&#x27;t call her, call her (?anymore?)&quot; (female)
@.12: He doesn&#x27;t seem to reply (male)
@.13: Steve (?Coogle? - unclear)

I know you typically don&#x27;t interact with the box by asking questions, but have you ever tried telling them to communicate one at a time?   It works for me most of the time when multiple voices crowd the box.  Regardless, they definitely like communicating with you.  I find the electronic voices and tones you get most interesting; they remind me of spiricom audio.

&gt;  A 6 seconds &quot;make sure he has the date--the 17th&quot;, as two seem to talk back
&gt; and forth. Yet another pick up date? I keep saying I still have stuff to do,
&gt; but now the talk about using force.
&gt; 
&gt;  Starts out &quot;he calls like I&#x27;m Jesus..&quot; it gets head warping weird.
&gt; 
&gt;  I really doubt these are acidental &quot;captures&quot;, as I don&#x27;t have a set time
&gt; to record.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have found that they do talk among themselves all the time. A lot of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; time, they are talking about me like I am not even there. In some of those
&gt; &gt;&gt; clips, you can definitely hear them talking amongst themselves.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; The main voice you hear (especially in clip 4) is my technician, or as I
&gt; &gt;&gt; call him, my facilitator. He is the one telling Raudive to ask his question
&gt; &gt;&gt; and telling an Other to wait. I have numerous clips where I will ask a
&gt; &gt;&gt; question and I can hear him ask the same question of the Others. This is all
&gt; &gt;&gt; the personal proof I need (besides my name and facts about my life coming
&gt; &gt;&gt; through a broken radio). To hear your own words coming through the radio in
&gt; &gt;&gt; a different voice is something that should be considered impossible...but
&gt; &gt;&gt; then to get an answer back from those reiterated words, well, I consider
&gt; &gt;&gt; that pretty damn good evidence that there is an intelligence trying to
&gt; &gt;&gt; communicate.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; But then again, any scientist can easily say that I was experiencing
&gt; &gt;&gt; nothing more that a Ham radio operator having fun at my expense. My only
&gt; &gt;&gt; come back to this is that since I still a ghost hunter, I have traveled
&gt; &gt;&gt; extensively to different locations. I have been bringing my box out in to
&gt; &gt;&gt; the field for location experiments. Guess what? My facilitator speaks in
&gt; &gt;&gt; every spot, in every state that I have tried this in.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Tim,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks for sharing your files - I heard a lot of different names in your
&gt; &gt;&gt; clips Nos. 1-3, including the names Tim, Mark, and Steve; in clip No. 2,
&gt; &gt;&gt; sounded like they&#x27;re mostly talking among themselves. In No. 1, I heard
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;This is Tim ... what is that... enough power.... settled.&quot; Nos. 4 and 5 are
&gt; &gt;&gt; very clear - heard what you heard.
