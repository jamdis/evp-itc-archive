 Just a light that shows when it's in AM, or off when in FM. The radio boa=
rd is inside a box, so you can't readily see what band it's on. Then I also=
 wanted to be notified if battery voltage was getting too low, so added the=
 low battery warning lights.
 
 So far this year, removed the audio AGC- re=
sulting in clearer voices
 added tone control, resulting clearer vocies,
 p=
erfected the AM radio design, resulting in clearer voices,
 added automatic=
 power on for the 469 when used as a tuner module
 added band indication fo=
r the 469. 
 
 Just using the 469 as a tuner module, instead of the hack, r=
esults in better voices, plus it has AM and FM.  
 
 So what part of advanc=
ing the technology is this not a part of. 
 
 Oh yeah, made the RoboBox--a =
Speakjet based system. Bill C. still has the distinction of being the first=
 to use that chip in his EVP system. Yeah, there is work being done outside=
 the group, and outside New Jersy!
