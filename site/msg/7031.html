<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>With all due respect, I am going to put my 2 bits in on this.  

I love the sharing of info, but have elected to post less and retire 
to reading more. :)

That said, I must agree with Ann that the initial post, though 
perhaps posted to be humorous, came off as disrespectful (in my 
opinion as a reader looking in on this forum) not only to BH but to 
FS.  BH does get animated at times, but he also brings some good 
input in here, too. 

We need to learn how to get along and work together.  Look at your 
initial post from someone else&#x27;s point of view and unban the poor 
fella&#x27;, won&#x27;t ya&#x27;?  ;)

&gt; I brought up a point in a lighthearted way, and it was NOT ABUSIVE, 
but
&gt; being abusive and attacking and degrading ones character is a 
totally
&gt; different scenario. There are 3 Mod&#x27;s on the board, and we discuss, 
before
&gt; choices are made. I am sorry if you are feeling conflict with is 
forum, if
&gt; your unhappy and want to un-join the choice is yours, we would 
certainly
&gt; hope you will re consider and have a better attitude with more 
harmony and
&gt; respect to all that post without defamation of character and abusive
&gt; language.

&gt; The person who began the issue with an offensive comment of her own 
comment
&gt; ought not to be the one suspending Bruce for responding to it. My 
opinion.
&gt; Your milage may vary.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Misty, this is a decision for a list owner. I think that is you and 
no

&gt; Jeff,
&gt;  
&gt; Mind your buisness and go back to the kiddie table.
&gt; your not supposed to get involved in real peoples conversations.
&gt;  
&gt; before you open your mouth read the post that this post was in 
reply too.
&gt; who are you to suggest anything, when was the last time anybody
&gt; saw any research or files from you? OOPS I forget nobody EVER did.
&gt;  
&gt; Stop sticking your mouth where it does not belong.

&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; That lost comment was uncalled for and extremely rude.  If you want 
to make
&gt; comments like that then I suggest you make it offline in private 
email.

&gt; DON&quot;T BE HATIN!!
&gt;  
&gt; First off the reason I got a new box From Frank is because he 
recognises
&gt; that 
&gt; I am a serious researcher, It does not have anything to do with 
being a man 
&gt; or woman. It has to do with being deserving of a Frank&#x27;s box and 
evidently!
&gt;  
&gt; Well do I have to spell it out? Start putting some time into your 
research
&gt; instead of
&gt; taking tantrums and maybe someday you&#x27;ll have a Frank&#x27;s box, But I 
doubt it!

&gt; hey guy&#x27;s 
&gt; 
&gt; I have been lucky enough to not only have Frank&#x27;s box #12 but now 
Frank 
&gt; has gifted me with a brand new box #29.
&gt; 
&gt; Here are the first files to come out of it. And it has not even 
been 
&gt; imprinted by mike and lisa yet. These files are from the first 30 
&gt; seconds of the first session.
&gt; 
&gt; let me know what you think.
