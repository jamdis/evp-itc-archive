I disconnect the\n&gt; processor board, after determining the function of the signals going to the\n&gt; radio board. You have to be able to turn on the radio itself with no\n&gt; processor board, then find the band change connection, the tuning voltage\n&gt; connection.\n&gt;\n&gt;   In the first boxes I used tuner modules removed from car stereos, then\n&gt; after the hack was &quot;discovered&quot; I started using other radios, such as the\n&gt; Radio Shack models, but I would only use the radio board, and disgard the\n&gt; rest. I have used walkman style radios as well, again, disgarding the\n&gt; processor board.  Usually there is a ribbon cable to the radio, you just\n&gt; have to determine what voltages are needed to operate the radio, and supply\n&gt; these from a power supply or voltage regulator.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I use Arm Band radios, Headphone radios, alarm clock radios that have\n&gt; digital tuning. I try to find radios that have a seperate tuner board.\n&gt;\n&gt;  So far radios that use a square chip seem to be software controled, so I\n&gt; avoid those. Not all digital radios are usable. The car tuners tend to be\n&gt; noisy.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Sometimes you can find the tuning voltage in a radio and just cut he\n&gt; connection, then insert an external tuning voltage from a sweep circuit. I\n&gt; have a Aiwa home stereo system that I made into a box using this method.\n&gt; It&#39;s not portable, but it works well, it has the advantage of a built in\n&gt; tape recorder.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; F-S\n&gt; On Tue, Sep 28, 2010 at 10:36 PM, Luis &lt;luispucp098@yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One question Frank , its posible make a frank box whith an analogic radio\n&gt;&gt; ?\n&gt;&gt; ... its a problem make it here in Peru . The digital radios are all whith\n&gt;&gt; the &quot;Mute&quot; , and the &quot;beep&quot; , its a problem , i cant still make , Are\n&gt;&gt; there\n&gt;&gt; any simple radio can i build ? ... whith a simply chip , in u.s.a are the\n&gt;&gt; radio shackÂ´s radios , its are simply to hack , but here in peru , there\n&gt;&gt; are\n&gt;&gt; only radios like &quot;walkman&quot; style , or discmans ,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;"}
