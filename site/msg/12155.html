<DIV>Hi Zack,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Read my review of the Ovilus 1.  The common mistake is that everyone turns it on and expects to get immediate results.  Well all that comes out is random names and what some people may term "garbage" at that time.  You have to let the spirits around you learn how to communicate thru the box and this can take a good 30 to 60 minutes.  At that time all the randomness will have died down and you can now start to communicate thru the Ovilus 1.  If this step is overlooked then you just sit there staring at this unit thinking you just pissed away $200.00.  And that is not the case.  It takes time for the spirits to learn how to communicate regardless of what device is used.  Now if you use this device in the same location over and over again you only have to do it once.  When I first got mine it was spewing out all kind of random garbage that made sense.  But once I did this the communication flowed
 fluently.  It even gave me the name of the little girl who's spirit inhabits our house and when I called her name after hearing it this little girl came and stood in the hallway looking at me in amazement.  The best was when my cat jumped up by me and the Ovilus 1 and wanted attention the Ovilus 1 said "good cat".  Then when my dog ran into the room and wanted my attention over the cat the unit said "bad dog", LOL.  So it does work and ask around to people who have them about their experiences.</DIV>
