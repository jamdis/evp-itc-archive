The AM is staticy, but the FM sounds ok.  I really don&#39;t like this radio model much, the sweep circuit if fine but the radio is iffy for sound quality on AM.\n\nI&#39;m willing top let this go for cheap to the first person who contacts me about it.  No Ebay auction this time, just a straight up sale.\n\nI&#39;m looking for $75 plus shipping costs.\n\n-Steve H."}
