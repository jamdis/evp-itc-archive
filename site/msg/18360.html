You asked several questions, so I'll take them one at=
 a time:

1) you hope what? that i made a fool out of myself or that i call=

I hope you called it in. Your resistance =
to giving the police information you said you thought you had on a child ab=
ductor, even after several prompts, makes me hope you did call it in, and d=
idn't just say that to stop me from prompting you. I don't know of course, =
I am not there. I have no desire that you make a fool of yourself, but if i=
t helps save a child from am abductor, I think it would be worth it.

2) Wh=

=A0 However, people continue to say there is more to it than my experience.=
=C2=A0 And so, I am keeping an open mind and trying to examine the evidence=
 you provide.

3) Why are negative people on
 these lists anyway. if you gu=
ys don't believe in this type of technology, why the heck are you all here?=
 

If I had absolulely no belief that there might be something interesting =
going on with the technology, I would not have been so insistent that you g=

ience, not prompt you to give that information to the police?=C2=A0 Again h=

Wouldn't the really negative thing be t=
