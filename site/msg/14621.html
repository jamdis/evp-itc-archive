&gt; Shane I listened to your first clip again and in the middle -probably around
&gt; the 15 sec mark I hear something although it is hard to make out. It could
&gt; possibly be STIFF..  Can&#x27;t be sure though.  As for the longer 2nd clip I can
&gt; really only hear the whisper that says YES right before you state &quot;you&#x27;re
&gt; gonna go now&quot;. I know there was someone trying to communicate because there
&gt; were a couple times I heard something but it was indiscernible to me.

&gt; thanks for the feedback btw in the first one did you hear around 15 seconds
&gt; .. thanks?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyhow here is the rest of that piece. The whisper makes sense now thanks to
&gt; the Name given I went back and listened and it does sound like Carson to me
&gt; .. I thought it was Mark lol thanks again.
