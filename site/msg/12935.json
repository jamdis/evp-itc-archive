The 12-470 has a TV audio band segment=\r\n, which now when hacked sweeps the TV audio in your area. &lt;BR&gt;After the sta=\r\ntions stop broadcasting their analog signals, 12-470 owners may have an add=\r\nitional opportunity to be able to sweep the following frequencies, with no =\r\ninterference from those high powered signals. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Channel - Audio Frequ=\r\nency &lt;BR&gt;2 - 59.75 MHz &lt;BR&gt;3 - 65.75 MHz &lt;BR&gt;4 - 71.75 MHz &lt;BR&gt;5 - 81.75 MH=\r\nz &lt;BR&gt;6 - 87.75 MHz &lt;BR&gt;7 - 179.75 MHz &lt;BR&gt;8 - 185.75 MHz &lt;BR&gt;9 - 191.75 MH=\r\nz &lt;BR&gt;10 - 197.75 MHz &lt;BR&gt;11 - 203.75 MHz &lt;BR&gt;12 - 209.75 MHz &lt;BR&gt;13 - 215.=\r\n75 MHz &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Who knows what type of signals we may be able to hear when t=\r\nhese frequencies are open and clear.
