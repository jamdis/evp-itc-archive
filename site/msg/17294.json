Also, I&#39;m a little\n&gt; chagrined that I&#39;d previously heard so little about the box, and what I had\n&gt; heard... well, it didn&#39;t encourage me to explore the subject.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, that&#39;s my point: Demanding personal proof and/or trying to silence\n&gt; speculation, data and results...
