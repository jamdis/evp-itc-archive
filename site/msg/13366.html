I have done original research into the question of Edison, EVP, ITC, Psychophones and mediumship. A white paper has been written and will be posted shortly. I'll post a link here when it is ready.

Briefly, Edison appears to have been interested in the problem. No device survives and the drawings that did surface in the late 20th century are suspect according to one of the world's leading Edison experts. At least four accounts are known involving Edison's potential post-mortem contacts through mediums. Some are quite interesting in terms of the information he provides and the consistency of what he says. These mediums are unknown to each other as far as can be determined and the communications range over a period of 60 years.

Edison did describe a technology at one point and the drawing that survives seems consistent with that description. However it is not in Edison's style and would not have been drawn by Edison given that it is a schematic. At the same time, Edison professed clearly his interest in the problem and his belief that science had a duty to explain the world of the mind as clearly as it had the world of matter.
