I have to be careful when I start thinking about having fun.  It usually involves \nthe prior curiosity &quot;I wonder what would happen if I tried.....&quot;  It&#39;s a miracle that to date, \nI&#39;ve not set anything on fire, damaged any of my equipment, or zapped the cr@p out of \nmyself on something.  LOL.\n\nThanks for the compliment on my ITC images.  I kinda miss working on that, but I&#39;m all \ncaught up in the two-way stuff for the moment.  Glad to read that I&#39;m not the only person \nlosing sleep around here!!  \n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mrs. Margaret\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I just playing with you, I didn&#39;t mean nothing bad.

What is said, and still maintain this opinion, is: \n&gt; \n&gt; My best (clearest, longest, most meaningful) responses have come via the manual radio \n&gt; sweep technique. My next favorite is the MiniBox. Third on my list of preferences is the \n&gt; hacked Radio Shack models. This is not to say I do not like them, but I like them least. \n&gt; \n&gt; This also does not mean that I&#39;m not open to experimenting with another model (I \n&gt; currently own both the old and new 469&#39;s and the old 470&#39;s, so I have based my opinion \n&gt; on experience and not just uninformed bias).\n&gt; \n&gt; I would place EVP Maker with the allophones file ahead of the shack hacks as well, but I \n&gt; don&#39;t consider that method to be among the &#39;radio sweep&#39; methods for comparison. \n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Margaret\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I though you didn&#39;t like RSGhost Boxes, I knew you would come around, kinda like \n&gt; when I said I would never buy a Mini Box, and now I&#39;m in the market to buy one of those \n&gt; too.lol\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rees\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Oh noooooo, Kay and Jeff. I&#39;m having a vision that making another purchase at \n&gt; Radio \n&gt; &gt; Shack is in my near future. ROFLOL. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Looking forward to hearing some 820 examples once they start coming through for \nyou.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Margaret\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Margaret \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The diffence between the 12-820 and new 12-469 is amazing. There is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; no clicking what so ever on either band. The Am band is so quiet I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; had to look at the radio to make sure it was still sweeping! I tried \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it out this morning for a bit but didnt get anything. I hope they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; like the new radio.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the update, Kay. I&#39;ve also noticed varying sweep times \n&gt; &gt; &gt; between AM & FM on other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; models. Not sure if the actual rate of sweep differs, for just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the amount of channels there is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be swept on one band versus another, so it takes longer to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; complete one full cycle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Margaret\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Tired of spam?
