http://www.danssmallpartsandkits.net/ A source for some components, like t=
he 100pf varactors. Most the other parts I get from mouser.com, jameco.com =
 or Radio shack, and the radio chip is from bdent.com  Of course, I'll have=
 to write up a parts list! but the schematic can be followed, I recommend u=
sing perf board from Radio Shack to start with, I'm always finding mistakes=
 in the drawings, and with perf board one stage at a time can be built and =
tested. I use the same proceedure on the SMT stuff. On the PCB I'm using 12=
06 reisitors, "C" size tantalum caps, and 3/8" square trim pots converted t=
o SMT use (make a J in the legs). There's no reason why someone could not c=
hange the layout to use surface mount trimmers, but the last time I tried t=
hat, Express PCB didn't have the correct footprints, so I had to kinda gues=
s at it making my own, and I had trouble with the trimmers holding up to mu=
ltiple adjustments. The layout is easy to do, and maybe it would be worth m=
aking one using all through hole components, except board price goes up to =
over $300 for two (min. order), as price is based on square inches. Cost is=
 the only reason I used SMT as much as possible, to reduce the size of the =
board.
 The number one problem I have in making this stuff is time. I'm alr=
eady spending every waking moment in the basement workshop, and believe me,=
 the Ol' Lady is beginng the complain! That's why the reluctance to take or=
ders, or sell this stuff.  Frank-S
