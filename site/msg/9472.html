That is funnny.. Yeah, I am amazed they can see us, and to think even before I got involved in Box EVP, I never thought once that they are right here in the room with us.
   
  Have a question for you. Margaret had mentioned in one of her posts that once we start Box Research, if we never have before, we are more likely to become chairaudient.
   
  Last night, was amazing for me while lying in bed. I heard them talking to me for the first time. It was really neat.
   
  Has this happened to you yet, or even to Kristin since the three of us are relatively new at this?
