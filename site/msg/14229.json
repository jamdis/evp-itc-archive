I have a question. I have 2 EVP&#39;s that have cursing words in them. The &quot;F&quot; word. One is from a female saying &quot; I hit it.....Fu$k&quot; and another Male (?) sorta mechanical (original mechanical voice without editing) that says &quot;HEY....we don&#39;t give a fu$k&quot; CAN I UPLOAD these (are very clear) female is lower audio, but the male is easier to hear (although his vowles are not as clear) Or would this be PROHIBITED. I don&#39;t want to offend anyone, just would like to give the true results as they are....we DO get some &quot;negative&quot; results sometimes. Please advise. Thanks. Jim H"}
