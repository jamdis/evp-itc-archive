dont ever say that again! it has not a dang thing to do with being smart frank! You have been doing this for years and build your own equiptment.....that makes you very intelligent! You just dont know what they are saying is true or not, who knows it sounds like most of the time they are have discussions on these matters, so even they have different opinions, theyre "people" too................lol
  and as we saw yesterday, some of them like to talk smack!  lol

              Hi all;
  
   I was trying to upload some of those predictions I�ve been getting, but started having problems getting to yahoo. I might have to do this stuff form home. 
  It�s not that I think the predictions are absolutely true, but they seem important, and it�s been my experience that when I try to judge what is crap, and what�s real, I�m usually wrong. I wanted to share these from my site, but there�s a weird problem with Internet Explorer, and ActiveX controls that locks up people�s computers that try to hear the voices. There is always a possibility that the predictions are from a fear mongering group on the other side, but I�m not smart enough to figure that out.
