<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>We did that on another group I&#x27;m on. We did about 20 tests for &quot;remote
viewing&quot; and several people got the correct answers in a much higher
probability than expected.

And it was fun!

&gt; Thats a REALY small sample size.
&gt; You would likely need several dozen experimenters to get any solid results.
&gt; But, nice try anyway.

&gt;  &gt; Thanks to everyone who participated in Experiment 3.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On Friday, 7/30/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer monitor,
&gt; right in front of me, and left it there until noon Denver time on Monday,
&gt; 8/2/2010. This experiment asked for participants to determine what that
&gt; object was. Vague or partial answers won&#x27;t be counted (for example, just
&gt; giving a color, shape, size, what it&#x27;s made of, etc): we&#x27;re looking for what
&gt; it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#x27;t count.
&gt; Participants could use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means
&gt; they chose.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the object at the start
&gt; of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this
&gt; group. The idea with this file is that you could download it at the
&gt; beginning of the experiment and &#x27;keep it safe&#x27; on your computer. Then at the
&gt; end of the experiment, I would post the password so you could reveal the
&gt; contents of the file. That way, you were in control of the original image
&gt; during the entire time, not me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Passworded pdf:
&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100730.pdf
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The password for that file is: 867530Nieine
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So to the results:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Number of participants: 2
&gt; &gt; Total tries: 3
&gt; &gt; Ambiguous answers: 0
&gt; &gt; Correct answers: 0
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Object: A Pot
&gt; &gt; Object picture:

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let
&gt; me know. Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this experiment.
