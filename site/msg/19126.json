That also affects the sweep. Rechargables are best, but that adds\ncost, and a charger.  I have this clip-leaded to a 12 volt gel cell.  At 2\nseconds, sounds like &quot;poor princess they want you again&quot; followed by what\nsounds like a wierd language, can&#39;t make it out.\n\nF-S\n\nI sen all my good, o newe bna e ies o Rolling Hills, and was unning his box on almos dead ba e ies, he ol age was down o 10 ol s o he pack.
