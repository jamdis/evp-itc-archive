I haven&#39;t had one of those since i started building this stuff.  I usually just record a sample anymore, yet they still get messages through.  It still amazes me how it&#39;s done, not sure how they do it but i&#39;m glad they can.\n\n-Steve\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;draiga1&quot; &lt;blackwing@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Steve, I hear both files too. That&#39;s cool on a test. It looks like they didn&#39;t want to wait for a formal session. \n&gt; \n&gt; ~Draiga\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, urkel23@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; While listening to the sample i caught a couple files that seemed relevant  \n&gt; &gt; to me.  My Dad used to always call me &quot;Stevie&quot; so that might be him, could  \n&gt; &gt; also be wishful thinking i suppose.  But the help file is very clear.   My \n&gt; &gt; Dad passed away last November, my guys keep telling me that he is helping  \n&gt; &gt; over there.  I hope that it&#39;s true, but i&#39;m sure nobody will hear these  \n&gt; &gt; except maybe Frank.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Steve Hultay\n&gt; &gt; _www.keyportparanormal.com_ (http://www.keyportparanormal.com/) \n&gt; &gt; _http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/_ \n&gt; &gt; (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/) \n&gt; &gt; _www.stevehultay.com_ (http://www.stevehultay.com/) \n&gt; &gt; _www.rtscresearch.org_ (http://www.rtscresearch.org/)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
