What happened to "pray for them that use you, do good  for those that 
despitefully use you" "pray for the enemy, "love your enemy's as  you love 
yourselves" forgive them"?  Oh don't worry they must make up  for what they have 
done in the past, no one gets away with anything in life, we  all must face 
Our Maker one day, but in not moving them on is only slowing  things down.  
Don't worry, we all pay for all, and any harm we have  caused while here.  We 
all have to pay the piper, in leaving them  there does not help anyone 
except those selling tickets  And who knows once  they have crossed over they 
may go back to make amends for those murders, rapes  and crimes  .sf

Those "poor ghosts" in that prison were  murderers, rapist, etc. They put 
themselves there. They have the capacity to  free themselves if they would 
realize it. In fact they would probably learn  something by doing it 
themselves, as opposed to getting it handed to them  without working for it.
 
I wish them neither harm nor foul, but I  will not go out of my way to help 
any such soul.

Isn't this kind of like a poor person on  the street, living in a cardboard 
box, or in poverty, sure they put  themselves there, many disowned by 
family, lost of jobs, no education, lack  of motivation when they were children, 
a drunken family that was nothing but  selfish, didn't care about their own 
children, nor the future of the  children.  These are ignored by strangers, 
and the community, look  away, no one sees them so, they are don't exist.  
Bums the lot of  them!  Is this how it's to be forever?  Poor ghosts of 
society,  they should be helped in any way we can, prayer is like sending 
positive  wishes, thoughts are things, negatives bring more negatives, positive  
thoughts do help others.   And so nothing changes, nothing  improves...

Yes, you need speical permission. I was there for an all night  ghost hunt 
as a guest of Eastern Paranormal. The place can be rented at  night but 
believe me when I say "it ain't cheap". Plus I don't think the  prison would 
appreciate me releaseing the inmates before their  eternal sentence has been 
served.
Steve

Does one need special permission to get in  there?  You folks should go 
back, and release them since a few of  them already know you Steve, this is 
Steve?  Right?   sf

Unfortunately I did not get to attempt to cross them. After my  
demonstration, another group that was also there started complaining  that the box made 
too much noise and was hendering their investigation  so I turned it off. I 
wouldn't want my direct communication with  the deceased inmates to mess up 
their EVP work, now would I? I  apoligized and put it away for the rest of 
the night.
 According to the prison staff, the inmates firmly believed  that if they 
died in prison their souls would be forever trapped  there. This belief was 
so strong that the prison officials would take  the elderly inmates who were 
dying of natural causes  to a local hospital so they would'nt have to die in 
the  prison. Maybe their beliefs were well founded.

This is a wonderful recording, were  you able to free any of them?  So sad 
to see them still there  behind bars, must be very lonely for them, they 
should be moving on  so, they can start to work on making up for things on the 
other  side.  You folks should go up there again, and hold a small  prayer 
vigil for them, of course they would no longer be ghosts  trapped there, but 
there are plenty more around.  sf

I was invited to spend the night in the West Virginia  Penitentiary this 
past weekend.. I was asked to give a short  demonstration with my Optimus 
12-797 hacked radio. Deep inside the  prison surrounded by concrete and steel, 
the radio could not pick up  any radio stations in manual mode. I wasn't sure 
how this might  effect the demonstration. I was pleasantly suprised with 
the  results. I recorded the session and the results can be heard at this  
link. _http://www.youtube. com/watch?  v=KwDYu4RULlk_

            <P>I was invited to spend the night i=
n the West Virginia 
            Penitentiary this past weekend.. I was ask=
ed to give a short 
            demonstration with my Optimus 12-797 hacked=
 radio. Deep inside the 
            prison surrounded by concrete and stee=
l, the radio could not pick up 
            any radio stations in manual mo=
de. I wasn't sure how this might 
            effect the demonstration. I w=
as pleasantly suprised with the 
            results. I recorded the sessio=
n and the results can be heard at this 
            link. <A title=3Dhttp:/=
