Raudive Diode", "author": "Country", "timestamp": "2010-11-03T00:42:13Z", "full_text": "Hello everyone....\n\nI was wondering if anyone had tried this piece of equipment to help them get EVP&#39;s and what their experience was like (good, bad, neutral)? I have read some about the original creator or discover of this method for EVP&#39;s. Anyway, I saw this listed on Ebay:\n\n&gt;&gt;This device re-creates two authentic Raudive Diode circuits in one unit that you can record together using any stereo recording device with a microphone socket. Unique dual circuitry gives you two different receivers in one unit. Connects to a microphone jack on a PC or tape recorder.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nThanks very much for your help and/or input!\nCB"}
