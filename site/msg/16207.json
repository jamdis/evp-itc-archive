But I find it hard to believe that entities on the other side \n&gt;  who are not dead people would go to so much trouble to impersonate my dead \n&gt;  friends and relatives -- why bother? If they truly seek attention, why not \n&gt;  come up with something more attention-getting than my dad&#39;s friend? Why not \n&gt;  impersonate my brother, who is really the one I&#39;m trying to reach? And \n&gt;  anyways, there are hundreds and hundreds of stories of people believing they \n&gt;  have seen or heard or spoken to the ghost of their dead family members (my \n&gt;  mother being one of them). They can&#39;t all be wishful thinking.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I find it much easier to believe that I&#39;m somehow unconsciously \n&gt;  making this happen (via the process Phenom Investigator describes) using the \n&gt;  box. But since it&#39;s equally possible for me or a discarnate dead person to \n&gt;  influence the box (via me and PK) (because, after all, we are no different \n&gt;  from the dead people except we still have our bodies), I will probably never \n&gt;  know if it&#39;s me or them making it happen. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I do know that I \n&gt;  hear things on the tape that are repeated over and over and over again, in \n&gt;  some cases twelve times in a row, which tends to rule out pareidolia. I also \n&gt;  have very clear sentences which anyone -- ANYONE -- without prompting could \n&gt;  understand and hear (I&#39;ve tested this with friends and family, letting them \n&gt;  listen and asking what they hear). And, like I&#39;ve said, the names I&#39;ve gotten \n&gt;  have mostly been of obscure dead friends and relatives, not the ones I&#39;m \n&gt;  trying so desperately to contact.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; So I&#39;m leaning toward the \n&gt;  dead people theory for now.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, \n&gt;  &quot;April Abercrombie&quot; &lt;april@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Maybe \n&gt;  you&#39;re not, but most EVP&#39;s you hear are just matrixng, which is why mostly no \n&gt;  one hears what the person recorded it thinks that they hear.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; But your proof here is subjective.

Then I realized that he \n&gt;  is now dead (last I saw him he was very much alive), and that he&#39;d been saying \n&gt;  Gordy all along (confirmed by playing back the old tape). I certainly didn&#39;t \n&gt;  expect to hear him come through, and yet he did, so I can&#39;t see how I could&#39;ve \n&gt;  expected to hear his name.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Jill\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, \n&gt;  &quot;phenom_investigato r&quot; &lt;phenom_investigato r@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Why do you disagree that PK is responsible for \n&gt;  most true EVPs? \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What about EVPs and/or PK tells you this \n&gt;  might be so?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, \n&gt;  &quot;April Abercrombie&quot; &lt;april@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;  &gt; &gt; I agree in that much of EVP is just pareidolia, or the listener \n&gt;  hearing what he wants to hear.

This could include discarnate agents. \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When you carefully consider \n&gt;  what is being heard, the themes often seem to reflect what may be subconscious \n&gt;  concerns of the operator or the listener. If external sources additionally \n&gt;  inform this process of perception, it is quite possible they influence both \n&gt;  what is recorded and how is later perceived. This would also nicely explain \n&gt;  why some people hear the same things on a recording while others hear quite \n&gt;  different things and more importantly while one person hears different things \n&gt;  from the same recording at different times.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; It would also remove the requirement that discarnates manifest \n&gt;  the phenomena. If discarnates are indeed non-physical, it is unclear how they \n&gt;  would modify the physical world. On the other hand, we have good evidence \n&gt;  demonstrating the ability of living individuals to alter their environments in \n&gt;  profound ways, apparently with their minds. So it seems to make more sense \n&gt;  that this might indeed by the underlying mechanism to EVPs rather than \n&gt;  discarnate manipulations.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- \n&gt;  In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, \n&gt;  &quot;mrscaptainjack2&quot; &lt;jjkamp@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m \n&gt;  wondering if a haunting-type situation such as yours would be different from \n&gt;  talking to your ancestors four or five generations back?

This would also nicely explain \n  why some people hear the same things on a recording while others hear quite \n  different things and more importantly while one person hears different things \n  from the same recording at different times.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; It would also remove the requirement that discarnates manifest \n  the phenomena. If discarnates are indeed non-physical, it is unclear how they \n  would modify the physical world.

So it seems to make more sense \n  that this might indeed by the underlying mechanism to EVPs rather than \n  discarnate manipulations.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- \n  In &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;/a&gt;, \n  &quot;mrscaptainjack2&quot; &lt;jjkamp@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m \n  wondering if a haunting-type situation such as yours would be different from \n  talking to your ancestors four or five generations back?
