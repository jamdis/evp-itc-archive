She was not the first one to claim the voices were fake, the\nfirst I heard of that was from Haunted Voices, the &quot;other&quot; magazine. My\naim was that if theses debunkers claim all my voices are fake, all I\nhave to do is provide one that can&#39;t be explained, or duplicate to make\nthe debunkers liars. \n\n\n It&#39;s true I can get upset, and rant and rave, but I never lie. \n\n\n Frank"}
