<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I checked to see what it would cost to sell one of ebay. To list it 
it is $1.00 for $25.00-449.00 plus 8.75% of the initial $25.00 
($2.19), plus 3.50% of the remaining closing value balance ($25.01 
to $1,000.00)
 

I would be willing to list the one I have plus give the information 
on the free hacking and that fact that you can get one at Radio 
Shack for $24.99 just to shut this guy down. At the most I would be 
out $1.00 to not sell it!!!! Well worth it I&#x27;d say.

Can someone send me the written instructions on how to hack the 12-
249.

&gt; Either that, or anyone willing to make them for $25 + shipping 
with 
&gt; no profit?  You could then list them just like the ones that are 
&gt; selling...so they pull up identical to the listings that are up 
&gt; there.  :)

&gt; &gt; I was thinking if someone would list a FREE DOWNLOAD of 
&gt; instructions for the various hacks 
&gt; &gt; on the Radio Shack units, it could put an end to the business 
for 
&gt; sellers that are taking 
&gt; &gt; advantage of people who are unaware that they could probably 
hack 
&gt; the units for 
&gt; &gt; themselves.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have seen &quot;downloads&quot; of various things listed before.  Why 
not 
&gt; this?
