But anyway, I don&#39;t know if I should name names, in an attempt to be a \nnicer bitch. I don&#39;t get it, I made the damn things, gave them away free, \nyet I can&#39;t be trusted to fix it, or at least verify the box works for me. I \nthink there may indeed be a limit, or at least a certain state of mind for \nusers. So I guess these people are left with ugly little door stops? I tried \nto e-mail  but one e-mail came back, the other ignored,  so I&#39;m thinkin&#39; \nblocked maybe, which does not show they are anymore honest then the user \nthey all hate------without naming names. BTW-Steve&#39;s not one of these \npeople.\n\n\nThis probably sounds vague, but they know who they are, and I don&#39;t get a \nresponse any other way, so probably a mis-use of the group, sorta.\n\n\nI didn&#39;t realize just how crappy car tuners were until I got the homebrew \ntuner working. I don&#39;t have anywhere near the static and noise in the HB \ntuner.\n\n\n  Frank-S\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nA new home for Mom, no cleanup required.
