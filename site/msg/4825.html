&gt; Thanks Ann, I&#x27;m trying.
&gt;
&gt; I would like to set up a group participation for a group session in  
&gt; this up and coming month.  I would like to get a series of  
&gt; questions together and have everyone with the same box&#x27;s do a  
&gt; session at the same time using these questions.

Might be interested. I&#x27;m game.


&gt;
&gt; It would be interesting to see what we all get as well as if some  
&gt; of the same voices come through for all of us.
&gt;
&gt; I know I have heard Steve come through when we were doing a session  
&gt; at the same time, and his and Bruces tecs voices have been verified  
&gt; by them and have come through to verify things if I had a problem  
&gt; during my sessions.

When you say this--you&#x27;re referring to Steve&#x27;s technicians or guides  
or whatever you want to call his regulars, right? Or is this a spirit  
Steve?

I&#x27;ve been steadily hearing &quot;Seven,&quot; &quot;Lisa,&quot; &quot;Rick,&quot; and &quot;Steve&quot; on my  
end. Today I heard from someone named Charlotte twice.
