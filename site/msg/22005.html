&gt; Hello EVP-ITC friends
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry it has been so long since I posted but life has been keeping me quite busy and Frank has been kind enough to step in and take over his group again. He is in complete control of running this show after returning from his short hiatus. 
&gt; 
&gt; I see some new faces here, I also see some old ones. I just thought I would take a moment to say hello to you all while I am here and remind you that you are not alone in your quest for knowledge. You have each other. That is why you are in this group. Work together not against each other. Embrace the possibilities within each persons ideas. Allow questions to spawn answers. Most of all have fun =)
