<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>hi everyone,

I have been experimenting with the manual FM sweep method for a good 
two weeks and have gotten some amazing results, but I can&#x27;t help but 
wonder if the manual movement of the dial no matter how consistent you 
try to make it results in some lagging and getting caught on a full 
word or phrase that is coming from an actual broadcast. The majority of 
messages I have been getting are direct answers to questions or a 
phrase or sentence that is obviously put together by different bits and 
pieces of the FM signals. I would like to know what you think of the 
manual sweep versus the automatic, I know Steve does his research using 
the automatic FM sweep box and I have been working with the manual 
method. When I listen to Steve&#x27;s captures they seem to be very fast and 
that to me makes it harder to understand and gives the opportunity for 
mistaking the sound of a word. the manual method on the other hand is 
slower and may give the opportunity to catch a broadcast word or two 
like I said so the question is which one do you think is more reliable ?
