Glad she made it thru but sorry it had to be this way. I understand how that feels. Yes on the training part too, I have gotten that quite often over the years when new spirits begin to speak sometimes the others help them or even speak for them if they arent getting across clearly. Sometimes its very detailed instructions that blow my mind. But it is interesting to listen to thier conversations there. 
   
  I also used to notice that sometimes when I would try a new method it would be almost as if my close contacts would go to another broadcasting station, go in, introduce themselves and announce they were there to speak to me or the relation to me then take over the session. Sometimes I think different methods invite new contacts/entities. However many of the contacts remain the same and will use any method I choose. 
   
  Losing so many people on this side only strengthens the bonds to that side more. Of that I have no doubt. It's the ties that bind. Very true statement. For those who havent experienced loss its a bit of a different experience overall. Theres nothing that can compare to hearing a voice thats been dead for so long or that you thought you would never hear again in this lifetime. Some of you know how that feels. It just hits such a high note that it resonates thru your spirit sometimes. In my case I have too many best friends, loved ones, relations who went before me and did keep thier promise to stay in touch whatever it took. 
   
  Only when we were all making those promises so many years ago we were just saying it more for the joke of it rather than the reality of it. One by one they all crossed over, and one by one they have kept thier promises. 
   
  So, that being said
  "If I die before you die I'm coming back to haunt you all"

          Yeah, since i start using the Radio Shack radios i have been getting 
full sentence conversations with them. I've been trying to contact 
my ex-girlfriend that passed last year at 29. That does sound like 
her voice, she has been coming through since Sunday night and i 
actually heard them through the radio telling her to talk and she 
said "Hi Steve". They were like training her to use the radio, 
pretty weird stuff but it was good to hear from her in her own 
voice. The response time is remarkable with these radios, they seem 
to answer right away very "frank's box"-like. These will keep me 
occupied while i wait for #27---the #13 replacement. I'm really 
excited about that one, it may be the one to live up to for all 
future boxes. I'm sure Frank could buy a radio shack box and add a 
sound chamber, that would probably really enhance the voices. These 
other boxes and radios are great, but there's only one Frank's Box 
for all others to try to live up to. I don't think a 10 Minute mod 
on a $25 dollar radio will ever replace the time and effort frank 
puts into his boxes. But anybody can try these radios and that's 
what is important, but without Frank there would have been no 
advancement in ITC. Someone had to break the ground work.
