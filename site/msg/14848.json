Hopefully he will do the same. It makes us all sad to see such distractions take away from the research. Put that energy it takes to argue into your work instead and everyone benefits from it. \n\nMisty\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I fixed that, I filtered his e-mail so it deletes automatically Bwahahaha!\n&gt; \n&gt;  Haliday is no box expert, nor does he have any long experience with the\n&gt; boxes, if memory serves, his first experiecne was like two years ago, and\n&gt; conned a box out of me be claiming to be a 9/11 first responder.  The\n&gt; paranormal is full of these jokers, all wanting to be the only experts.\n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Jun 4, 2009 at 2:05 PM, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    Snowfirel,\n&gt; &gt; I was responding to your message and got disconnected (storming down here\n&gt; &gt; LOL) so not sure if any of it made it thru so I will repeat what I can of my\n&gt; &gt; original response.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bruce is no longer a member of the EVP-ITC group. When responding to his\n&gt; &gt; messages please post ONLY in his group or wherever you are responding to. I\n&gt; &gt; know that you like to cross post to all groups at once.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He is no longer allowed to post here because of his vicious attacks on\n&gt; &gt; members and we definitely do not tolerate attacks on our founding member\n&gt; &gt; Frank S who started this group in the first place. Bruce lost his posting\n&gt; &gt; abilities a long time ago because quite frankly we had seen enough of the\n&gt; &gt; attacks. He would attack someone, unjoin then rejoin and apologize, it would\n&gt; &gt; be calm a while then the cycle would repeat itself. I think you will see the\n&gt; &gt; same if you check the archives of any group he has been a member of.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank likes to vent too. He often gets tired of these attacks in his inbox\n&gt; &gt; or things people say upset him. I personally have no problem with people who\n&gt; &gt; vent its when they email members privately and threaten them that it becomes\n&gt; &gt; a problem. Unfortunately this is why I can not let bruce rejoin our group\n&gt; &gt; even tho he has tried to many times. It makes me very sad.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I understand your wishes for everyone to work together. We all have a\n&gt; &gt; common goal when it comes to the research, but sometimes people are not\n&gt; &gt; focused on the research they have other things on their minds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That being said Bruce is no longer allowed to post here and members of this\n&gt; &gt; group who post for him risk the same consequences. As you notice if frank\n&gt; &gt; copies what crap bruce is emailing he is at least nice enough to leave the\n&gt; &gt; guys name out. Those who know Bruce know who it came from. Those who dont he\n&gt; &gt; has a chance for a fresh start with and I hope he uses it wisely. I wish him\n&gt; &gt; luck and hope the best for him but theres no more I can do to help. I tried\n&gt; &gt; many times to stop the fighting between everyone and it may end for a short\n&gt; &gt; while but then things like this start to happen.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Please refrain from posting responses to bruce in our forum. I dont say\n&gt; &gt; this to upset you any further... instead I say it because the research we do\n&gt; &gt; is far more important than anyones ego or being the right one in an\n&gt; &gt; argument. I think you agree with me there since you wish they would all kiss\n&gt; &gt; and make up. I&#39;d like nothing better but at this point I dont see them doing\n&gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I cant change people from being who they are, all I can do is change\n&gt; &gt; myself. I am sorry for any distress this causes you. Believe me I\n&gt; &gt; understand. I am not telling you to stop being friends with anyone either,\n&gt; &gt; if anything they could use such a postive spirit in their lives. Lead by\n&gt; &gt; example, dont follow blindly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Love and Light!!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Misty\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On *Thu, 6/4/09, SnowfireL@... &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: SnowfireL@... &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: [RTSC] a copy of my final e-mail to Frank sumption I\n&gt; &gt; will go no further!\n&gt; &gt; To: RTSC@...m, inside_the_box_rtsc_talk_radio@yahoogroups.com,\n&gt; &gt; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, June 4, 2009, 3:25 PM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   *Sorry to hear this Bruce, I sure hope things get better,  I had no idea\n&gt; &gt; there were so many problems when I joined all these lists,  I think you are\n&gt; &gt; all great people, you folks together are making history don&#39;t you all\n&gt; &gt; realize this?  There are so many people out there that have never heard of\n&gt; &gt; this type of communication, thousands out there!  My friend just lost her\n&gt; &gt; mother a couple of weeks ago, when I told her about the work you all are\n&gt; &gt; doing, tears were replaced with a smile, she is looking forward to hearing\n&gt; &gt; from her mom now too.

I have made the same challenge to your friend moon\n&gt; &gt; who we all know is behind this tirade he has time and again refused or\n&gt; &gt; ignored the request for any type of audio file\n&gt; &gt; to be publicly posted for revue and continues to take advantage of innocent\n&gt; &gt; unsuspecting people with his con game and charging large amounts of money\n&gt; &gt; for sessions where he fabricates and makes up content as he goes along.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was the only one to confront him in public and expose him for the fake he\n&gt; &gt; is and this is his feeble attempt at retaliation. I and other researchers\n&gt; &gt; like me have brought this research light years from where it was when you\n&gt; &gt; and I first met, moon just continues to use it to rip people off and has not\n&gt; &gt; contributed a thing to the research of ghost box communication beside lining\n&gt; &gt; his own pockets.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just the fact that he has you doing his dirty work shows the type of guy he\n&gt; &gt; is. I can remember a time when you publicly came out against any type of\n&gt; &gt; money making using your boxes and even refused moon when he wanted to\n&gt; &gt; manufacture and sell them for large profits yet now you condone his robbery\n&gt; &gt; of innocent unaware people and actually act foolish on his behest.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank you are better than this, just concentrate on developing a better box\n&gt; &gt; and forget about moon and his tricks and lies, he is finished in the\n&gt; &gt; paranormal and he knows it, everyone is wise to his game and he is\n&gt; &gt; practically an outcast.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank you are hitching you wagon to a dead horse. Get away from these bad\n&gt; &gt; influences before they ruin your reputation as well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We have had this moon discussion in the past and once he has exhausted his\n&gt; &gt; need for you he will screw you again like he has done so many times before.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank, I like and respect you and I hope you will consider what I have said\n&gt; &gt; in this e-mail and I sincerely hope you post this one on the evp-itc group.\n&gt; &gt; I will be posting it on my group and others I belong to.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your former friend\n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Limited Time Offers: Save big on popular laptops at Dell&lt;http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100126575x1221354145x1201369495/aol?redir=http:%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fclk%3B215221161%3B37268813%3By&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
