Hi All;
 
 I feel like I'm getting pulled inmultiple directions, each want=
ing to validate, and endorse their version of the box, and/or the results. =
It's nerve wracking, and making me nuts. I don't know what is the correct u=
se, function, or output of the box, I know only how I use it. I get what mo=
st others get, and more. What everyoe else does wiht it is up to them. The =
box is an ITC devcie, my orignal use was to use for my own communications. =
It seemed rel;ated to EVP, so i shared my results on various EVP web sites,=
 and groups. I regret that, I  wish I would have kept it to myself. Humanit=
y doesn't even understand their own minds, and yet they want to comunicate =
with the higher realms. The other uses, such as spirit communcation, I tend=
 to stay away from, it's too unpredeictable, and you can't tell who/what is=
 talking. Personally I think 90% is your own minds talking back to you, and=
 giving what is expected.  
 
 I've reached a point where I've had enough p=
ublic interaction. Everyone wnat to beat up Moon, yet everyone wants to do =
the same friggin' things, and I'm stuck in the middle.  I don't vcare about=
 demons, bad guys, or saints coming through, I have my own group that comes=
 through, and that's what the box was made for.
