<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes sound can be a carrier as well as the silence. People have recorded evp using a variety of methods and tools and conditions. I&#x27;ve even had an instance that chainsaw noise was being used and I was able to record some of the speech.
Musical instruments such as guitar and piano tones have also yeilded some results. Ive posted some in the files section here of a few methods and alot on esnips. Links are to the left.

&gt; Hi Misty
&gt; 
&gt; You&#x27;re the only person I&#x27;ve heard mention this, and
&gt; it makes me feel better knowing I&#x27;m not crazy (at keast
&gt; totally). lol Long ago I noticed that running tap water
&gt; sometimes seems to sound like garbled speech. I never
&gt; tested this with a recorder, but I&#x27;ve caught some evps
&gt; with refrigerator motors and other devices. Audacity has
&gt; the &quot;add white noise&quot; option, which allows you to
&gt; record directly to your computer and allow the entities to
&gt; organize the generic white noise. I&#x27;m eager to try
&gt; that. An excellent observation you had, Misty. I think they
&gt; must grab hold of any babbling or whirring noise available
&gt; to communicate, whether we&#x27;re able to pick it up or
&gt; not. That&#x27;s why I carry around one of the lightweight
&gt; Olympus recorders -- no telling where you&#x27;re going to
&gt; find a babbling-brook or steady motor sound. Good ear!

&gt; 
&gt; Sweep tuning can be used on AM FM shortwave etc. I have had
&gt; some 
&gt; 
&gt; success without tuning just allowing them to use the static
&gt; or water 
&gt; 
&gt; noise thats in background. Best advice one cold give is try
&gt; it 
&gt; 
&gt; yourself for a while and see what you come up with =)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Why do you need to &quot;sweep&quot; the AM spectrum? 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Has anyone tried this but without sweeps on the
&gt; shortwave band? Has 
&gt; 
&gt; any research been done? Could it be that the AM band has
&gt; some sort 
&gt; 
&gt; of &quot;special properties&quot; that would allow such
&gt; communication? 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Why is it that the AM band has to be used with a radio
&gt; station 
&gt; 
&gt; playing? There are parts of the spectrum that is just
&gt; outside of that 
&gt; 
&gt; spectrum that might provide a better form of communication.
