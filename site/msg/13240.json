This group\n&gt; tended to be more ghost hunter oriented, or it seemed that\n&gt; way to me. So just to avoid arguements I dropped off for\n&gt; awhile. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  I&#39;ve been trying to combine aspects of Spiricom with\n&gt; boxes, such as mixing fixed tones in with the radio audio.\n&gt; So far, there does seem to be some entities that use the\n&gt; tones to enhance voices. The troubel is I have no idea what\n&gt; frequencies to use, so I started with a set of eight in the\n&gt; leatest test, tuned to the lowest G major scale that would\n&gt; register on my auto-chromatic tuner. I have a couple systems\n&gt; that use tow tones. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Windows Live™ Hotmail®: Chat. Store. Share.
