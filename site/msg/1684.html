<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I don&#x27;t know what kind of breakthroughs you&#x27;d expect to make. My system is 
pretty much like EVPmaker, and you can do the same thing by tuning a radio 
across it&#x27;s band manually, while recording. There&#x27;s not really a special 
technology you need. It&#x27;s mostly providing something the spirits/entities 
can use to form thier voices, and they have most of the control on their 
side. I think most of all, you can&#x27;t approach it like you already know 
everything about the paranormal, I think it takes an open mindedness, an 
almost childlike attitude. You have to remember the people you are 
attempting to contact have all their mental faculties, we on the hand are 
quite limited. I think maybe you&#x27;re basing your expectations on what Moon 
claims, most of which is highly exagerated.

I&#x27;m just now having a go-round with people that claim to be paranormal 
experts, they won&#x27;t use the boxes as I recommend, yet proceed to tell the 
world how it really works. It always creates hard feelings on both sides.  I 
suggest you work on some of the simple methods first, they can be just as 
effective as an electronic system, and you may learn more. I&#x27;m not even sure 
I want to make any more boxes.

&gt;Mr Sumption, I desire very much to obtain a &quot;box&quot;. What would it take to 
&gt;get one??? I am a serious researcher with over 40 yrs. of investigation 
&gt;under my belt. After reading and reviewing everything I could find 
&gt;concerning your device, I, personally, have the greatest confidence in 
&gt;making milestone leaps of progress with it. I would be very pleased to hear 
&gt;back from you soonest. Thank you in advance.    --Roderick Pyatt, Ph.D
