Or maybe there is also a learning curve on the other side with figuring 
out how to use the box effectively.

One thing I want to experiment with is to feed them through a voice 
recognition program.  Years (OK, decades) ago when I got my degree in 
linguistics, I took some graduate coursework in how the brain perceives 
spoken language.  There is a degree to which a sound can waiver from the 
actual target but still have the brain recognize it.  The recordings we 
get remind me a lot of experiments I did in college where we would 
program a computer to pronounce a word with a sound somewhere between, 
for example, "b" and "p", combine it with some more sounds to make a 
short word, like "bat" or "pat", and see which way the subject perceived 
it.  If the spirits have trouble getting the message through clearly on 
their end, looking at ways to interpret it better on our end might help.

I'm green with envy. =)

I'll be looking forward to hearing them.  One tip - if you are using a 
hand-held recorder, be careful to keep it far enough away from your box 
that it doesn't cause interference itself.  I noticed a big difference 
in how staticy my recordings out in the field were over the weekend vs. 
the ones I've been recording directly into my computer.  I guess I ought 
to invest in an external mic for the hand-held.
