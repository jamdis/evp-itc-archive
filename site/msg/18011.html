I see your points.=C2=A0 Perhaps these experiments, in finding out more wha=
t works and what doesn't, can be used to increase enjoyment in the long run=
, and make the best use of the resources and time each person has?

experiments and protocols

ve
                    the protocol RJ suggested initially. Using a test 
 =
                   target is one way of establishing a 
                   =
 truth in time, which is the basis of this experiment. 
                   =
 But there are a couple of issues.
                    =C2=A0
             =
       It is quite possible that someone could discern the 
               =
     target through remote viewing alone.
                    This would ne=
gate the need for involvement of a spirit 
                    communicator=
 or discarnate entity.
                    Outcomes=C2=A0depend on the word=
 of those reporting. 
                    The true skeptic (not cynic) woul=
d 
                    therefore say that this experiment contains a basic =

                    flaw in that it=C2=A0does not uniquely 
              =
      indicate that the information was obtained in the 
                  =
  prescribed manner. Providing access
                    to the raw audio =
file would not necessarily constitute 
                    proof either, si=
nce many of these 
                    communications can only be heard by =

                    =C2=A0
          =
          If the audio file were quite clear, 
                    timing=
=C2=A0=C2=A0becomes an issue. In other words, when was 
                   =
 
                    the audio actually recorded?=C2=A0 This issue can be =

                    mitigated simply by requiring any
                    =
claimant to email the audio file to a trusted party 
                    be=
fore the test ends. It would be best 
                    if the trusted pa=

it was=C2=A0 their duty 
                    simply to=C2=A0collect the cla=
ims. Once all claims had 
                    been collected they could be =
posted 
                    publicly for review=C2=A0by the community in

                    The important detail however is that this =
experiment 
                    does not completely answer the 
           =
         question. It is a first attempt and certainly can be

        improved on successive trials.
                    =C2=A0
         =
           Successive trials are always a good idea, since it 
            =
        provides replication. And it would be
                    best if o=
thers replicated the experiment using a very 
                    similar p=
rotocol. If these were to
                    succeed, the community could =
then state that out of X

                   some definition of success) potentially=C2=A0giving a 
 =
                   success rate above that expected

 random chance. This would make the outcome
