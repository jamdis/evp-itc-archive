I think we are going to come to the\nconclusion that the human component is far more important then the\nother components, although they all work together. \nWe have all heard others stating their own inability to &quot;make the box\nwork&quot;. These statements have been followed by claims of fraud and\ndeception. \nI suppose that I should not concern myself with that. I know that the\ndevice works and I doubt that anything could convince me otherwise.\nYet, I remain concerned. I am concerned for those who have been\nsuccessful. Right now, we have few that have been willing and able to\nbuild the device themselves, hence few that have been able to claim\ndeception. What happens to the credibility of the few when many are\nunsuccessful? Should that concern me? I am extremely passionate about\nthis field, sometimes to a fault I would suppose. \nOne brief glance around this community shows the fragile egos at work\nall clamoring to move up some invisible ladder via whatever means\npossible. There is little support amongst investigators and\nresearchers. Lines have already been drawn as a result of this device.\nI am not confidant in my psychic abilities at all but I feel pretty\nsure that there is going to be some major fall out as a result of this\nmini-box being sold to whoever wants it. I hate the &quot;wait and see&quot;\napproach. I&#39;m too much of a control freak!

You can do the\nsame thing the box does by hand, and at times I think the manual\nmethod works better. It&#39;s not the technology that matters, it&#39;s not\ncontacting departed loved ones that matters, it&#39;s not proving a\nhaunting that matters, it&#39;s only proving to oneself that life is\nforever.  What possible difference does anything else make?\n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: bulletbabea@...: Fri, 16 Nov 2007 21:18:58\n-0800Subject: [EVP-ITC] LOL\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Oh my gawd, you people.. I love ya all but I wrote at least 4 reply\nemails and deleted them as soon as I finished LOL\n&gt;  \n&gt; Hmm so I will just say\n&gt; 1)We are mostly all adults tho some younger folks may have joined.\nLets try and remember that\n&gt; 2)Franks box is what it is. The first of many. It is always evolving\nand changing and that is how it is presented by Sumption himself. A\nfree design for any and all who care to build it.\n&gt; 3)Working together as a group is important, otherwise why bother\njoining here.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Let me know if I need to give ya 4 its a doozy hehehe\n&gt;  \n&gt; Really guys and gals, I am mega busy at work so I basically do a run\ndown thru every post before/after work and sometimes it just has me \ndismayed.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I know you all are capable of better, and able to work together in a\npositive way. Ive seen it many times. Dont worry about what everyone\nelse thinks, just worry about what YOU think. Dont try and form the\nopinion of someone else, instead work on discovering your own. And\nresearch.... well? Get back to it!  and share, you just might make\nsome connections.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;GROUP HUGGGGGG&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; LOL\n&gt; Misty Dawn\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Never miss a thing.
