Thanks Joe! I have a bar antenna I&#x27;m using now, and I think the main problem 
is I&#x27;m trying to use too large of tuning cap, maybe the the varactor is even 
bad(?). Trying to resonate the antenna with the varactor is like feeding a 
short, I get nothing. So far I have to put the bar antenna across the choke, 
showin in the schematic for the LA1816. The choke provieds a DC path for the 
RF Vcc, I get nothing without it, but just putting a finger on the choke 
results in good loud signals.

The bar has 30 turns #34 that is across the choke, and another 120 turns 
like a primary, with one end grounded, and the other end just goes to a 
longer wire. Just connecting the large end across the input results in less 
signal. I got good clear signals late last night with this. The clarity of 
some of the voices even surprises me.

Then there&#x27;s problems with a bad connection on the main board, and if I push 
on the board, the audio clears up. I think I have it working well enough to 
show the PCB design will work ok, so I can order the PCBs, which will 
eliminate some of the problems. I added extra &quot;holes&quot; so there&#x27;s alternate 
antenna connection possiblities, while leaving the original RF amp idea in 
place.

I do have antenna rods of various sizes in the junk box.

Like I said, I ain&#x27;t no engineer!

&gt;Hi Frank,
&gt;
&gt;I wonder if you have the small bar antenna I suggested awhile ago? That
&gt;antenna has two coils and can be used in any way two windings on the same
&gt;coil can be used. These antennae are resonated with parallel caps. I&#x27;ve
&gt;resonated two windings in series with a parallel varactor diode to get a
&gt;high impedance tank circuit. Total series inductance 600uH, in parallel 
&gt;with
&gt;100pf diode. The larger coil (500uH) can be resonated with 140pf tuning 
&gt;cap.
&gt;These antennae are used without input windings because they rely on the
&gt;concentration of flux in the ferrite core to gather radio signal.
&gt;
&gt;The long replacement rod antennas have two windings, one for AM MW
&gt;(broadcast) and a smaller one for SW. These windings are separately
&gt;resonated with  tuning caps on there respective bands.
&gt;
&gt;These antennae are not viewed as input transformers, but as signal 
&gt;gathering
&gt;tank circuits. However, I believe they can also act as broadband magnetic
&gt;loop antennae. In this mode they are not sharply tuned to each channel, but
&gt;are meant to develop a broadband output. The characteristic impedance is
&gt;high compared to the tuner input and might need matching for good results.
&gt;
&gt;I suggest the use of a grounded foil shield to reduce static pickup.
