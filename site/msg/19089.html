Thanks for responding. I thought it was too good to be true. So sad these d=
evices are way overpriced, only to find out they do not work.

The on=
y paranormal device I have seen that really works that was tested on a para=
normal show, is the Frank's Box which was tested on an airing of Paranormal=
 State by Chris Moon, and on Psychic Kids tested by Chip Coffey.

Greetings:

I have a RT-EVP and can give you my thoughts on this. I initi=
ally found this box to be difficult to learn how to use it; I didn't find i=
t user friendly but I am not a tech-noid either.

Second, I tried the FM sw=
eep feature but it never swept fast enough to be a useable feature.

Third,=
 while I haven't used this box a lot, I have caught very few EVP's using th=
is box and typically one word EVPs in general.

And last, the box promotes =
real time evp's because you wear earbuds so can hear responses to your ques=
tions. The problem is you can't hear what is being said, you know you caugh=
t something but it is not loud enough to make out what is being said. This =
also happened with Ghost Lab, one of the newer ghost chasing TV programs; t=
hey caught the name of a private from the Civil War in Gettysburg but could=
 not make out what he was saying until they downloaded it onto their comput=
er and opened it with some type of audio program.

In spite of all of the a=
bove, I really think a person needs to try different types of boxes or reco=
rders and find out what works best for you. I think the user has some input=
 (whether it is a person's energy or vibes or connection or?) into how well=
 something works. What may not work well for me, may work well for someone =
else and vice versa.

Hope this helps,
CB
