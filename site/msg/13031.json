Lucky for\nme... I was in attendance and got to meet and listen to those who wear\nlots of stars or are appointed to positions of our Nation&#39;s power base.\nUnfortunately, the conference wasn&#39;t about EVP, ITC, or spirit\ncommunication. But, who knows... maybe someday they (at the top) will\nhold a conference like that.\n\nAnyway... I wanted to give an update on my latest direction for those\nwho e-mailed me or messaged me while I was on the east coast last week.\nFirst... I&#39;d like to thank that documentary production company for\ncontacting me, asking about the use of my prototypes, but I have to\nrespectfully decline your offer as I only do this for my own research,\nproviding the information FREE to all who desire to built there own\ndevices. And after having been led astray by a not-to-be-named\nparanormal radio show venue about a certain Stanley Hotel conference,\nI&#39;m a bit gun-shy at getting involved with such ventures.  Also, for\nthose who wrote and asked about me selling products,  I don&#39;t build and\nsell anything. I just provide FREE information for my fellow\nresearchers.\n\nOkay... on with my story.\nWhile sitting in my hotel room last week I continued to read one of\nSarah Estep&#39;s books. In one of the chapters she writes about the plane\ncrash into the Potomac River, which happened a number of years ago. Many\npeople died when the airplane went into that frozen river, and she\nexplains how she and others began receiving messages from the crash\nvictims at almost the exact time time crash occurred, even though she\ndidn&#39;t know about the crash at the time.\n\nShe then writes about the crash of two jumbo jets, where hundreds lost\ntheir lives instantly, or soon after the accident. And how the spirit\nworld was filled with communication because of this large disaster.\n\nThat got me thinking...\n\nI too have always been super sensitive about deadly plane crashes,\nfeeling for the families of the victims, as well as, and especially for\nthe victims themselves.\n\nOne crash in particular put me into the extensive research mode about\nthe crash and the victims. So-much-so that I contacted the wife of the\nplane&#39;s pilot, where I was able to help put some closure into her world\nafter a number of contacts. (Not wanting to discuss too much, let me\njust say I was able to view things she was not allowed to view. And\nafter doing so I was able to describe things to her that she always\nwondered about.)\n\nThe commercial aircraft in question crashed so violently that remains of\nthe passengers were never all recovered. And after years of legal\nbattling, the settlements were made and the entire aircraft wreckage was\nreleased to a salvage company.\nI was there, at the warehouse, when the many trucks left with the many\npieces of plane, enroute to their salvage yard.  And while there I\ntalked with the attorney and investigative lead, who were both on-scene\nto over-see the finalization of this effort.\n\nTo get off topic for a bit, I for one am of the opinion that in the\nspirit communication world, an object is key if communication with a\nspecific entity is desired. I know many do not agree, and think that\nopen communication is possible anytime, anywhere... but I&#39;m not one of\nthose people.\n\nI may be wrong or I may be right, but I think an object or location are\na must when specific communication is desired. hence, the reason I stand\nnext to a certain grave site, or location where a death actually\nhappened, or have a related object in hand or near where a session is\nbeing done.\n\nOkay... having said that, while I was observing the movement of the\nplane crash debris, I was offered a small piece or two by those who now\nowned the salvage material. (No longer in litigation and no longer owned\nby the airline company).  I refused acceptance of anything at the time,\nbut asked if the salvage company had, by chance, forgotten something in\nthe warehouse or on the grounds, was it okay for a person to possess it.\nThey told me, yes.\n\nLater that evening, when all the material had been moved out of the\nwarehouse, I once again visited the scene. Looking around I found they\nhad done a very good job at clean-up, only leaving a few pieces of small\nmetal, wire, paper, and fabric near the large doors.\n\nI picked up the few items that were still there and headed toward the\nlarge trash container that was on the property, my intensions to drop\nthose items into the trash. But, while holding them I received a very\nstrong feeling, a very emotional sensation that would not allow me to\nput them in the trash. It was so strong in-fact, that I began crying. \nIt just flowed through me, consuming me as it went.\n\nMy emotional feeling was just like it had been earlier in the day when I\nplaced one hand on one of the engines that were mangled and filled with\nimpacted dirt that was once the ground in the place that became the\nfinal resting place.\n\nOnce I arrived home, I carefully placed the small amount of debris\nmaterial (metal, wire, carpet fabric, paper, etc.) into a sealed glass\ncanister, where it remains to this day.\n\nWhere am I going with this story...???\n\nTwo weeks from now, I have a two week vacation coming... which will be\nspent at home.\n\nAfter reading Sarah Estep&#39;s book, especially the chapter about the plane\ncrash victims, I&#39;ve decided to use those objects I acquired from the\nwarehouse grounds, as the objects that may help me make some specific\nspirit contacts.\nI have already researched that crash, and I have all the victims names,\nalong with some information of there life&#39;s. Maybe I will be able to\ngain information and answer some questions... so I can contact others,\nbesides the original contact with the pilot&#39;s wife, as I told you about\nearlier in my writing.\n\nAll I can do is try... and see what happens.\n- Mike C.
