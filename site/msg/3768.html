I have "reversing decks" and I do it on the computer with normal speech, a=

If someone could take a digital speech recordng, stored in memory, and chop=
 it up, and play it back over a speaker, I think it would work just as well=
 as radio. You could get live voices, answers to questions, and never repla=
ce the raw audio. This is in fact EVPmaker, but it would be nice to have it=
 portable. EVPmaker pretty much took all the mystery out of this, and it's =
all but igonred. My system, and analog version of EVPmaker using technologi=

f I mispell some things in this post, I'm currently running the production =

100 things at once!Okay... According to some, "...the Spirit Technicians an=

at the Telephone to the Dead technology works, is by spirit energy manipula=
ting the random voltage generator (RVG) and using white and pink noise, as =
well as radio fragment, to create real time voice answers to questions pose=
d from our side. The most important aspect to this device is the medium ope=
rator who works as an antenna or "interpreter" for living individuals askin=
g the questions."So, that said (or copied and pasted) I have decided that m=
y next attempt with the older version of the 12-470 will be the following:1=
) Add a method of variable voltage used to adjust the tuning circuit, simil=
ar to the RVG mentioned above. I went out and purchased another older 12-47=
0 today, to do just this.(Frank... I did some measurements of that VT and f=
ound a range to work with.. I hope!)2) Add that white or pink noise to be m=
ixed with the sweeping raw audio already available from the modified 12-470=
.3) Add an internal antenna for the 12-470.4) Add an interface so the user =
will be a active/passive part of the radio. As mentioned above, as the ante=
