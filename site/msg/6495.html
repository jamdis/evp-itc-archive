&gt; Jeremy,
&gt;  
&gt; Like I said there is no need for that fancy setup.
&gt; Just use the box and a digital voice recorder next to it and do your
session.
&gt;  
&gt; Do one 5 minute session like that and send it to me, I would like to
hear what a plain session 
&gt; with your signal sounds like without direct recording or more than
one box.

&gt; Bruce, I used an older 12-469, the gray and white one. I had
ithooked up to a Behringer Xenyx 1622FX mixer along with a Shure
SM58microphone running to the computer and recorded in Audacity. I
live in Dayton, Ohio. There there are a handful of AM stationsaround.
The most prominent being 700 WLW out of Cincinnati. Theproblem I&#x27;ve
run into is that the stations that come in clearly startanywhere from
2-4 bands before and after their actual frequency.I also have a RS
20-125. I&#x27;m getting ready to do another session in afew minutes so
I&#x27;ll use the 20-125. I know it probably won&#x27;t makemuch of a difference
as far as signal goes, but I&#x27;m gonna try it out.Jeremy--- In

wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Jeremy,&gt; &gt; Are you using a 12-469 or 470 ?&gt; If you are
using a 469, what is the set up&gt; are you recording directly from the
box and &gt; using a splitter with a speaker attached ?&gt; &gt; Or recording
from the stand alone 470?&gt; &gt; The reason I ask is because other than
the single word response you&gt; are receiving, I hear no indication of
the RS box sweeping the stations.&gt; It is all static noise except for
the message. &gt; &gt; You are not getting any signal at all.&gt; you should be
hearing the different stations change and continuousfragments of
speech&gt; while the box sweeps the band.&gt; &gt; Let me know where you are
and how you are setting up for a session.If you are getting that
response without any clear signal&gt; think of how you will communicate
with even a half way decent signal.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; Bruce Halliday &gt; &gt; &gt;
