None of this is proof. None of this evidence say that all, or even most EVP=
's are caused by PK. You even used words like "potential link" and "strongl=
y implicates."  This doesn't mean it is proven.

--------------------------=
------------------------------------------------------


[Now let's turn to=
 the evidence for PK as an explanation for the EVP. A close colleague of mi=
ne, a respected parapsychologist in Los Angeles, was working years ago in a=
 well-known haunted site in the Hollywood area. He recorded the voice of th=
e home's owner, while standing next to the man. During this interval the ma=
n did not speak; no one heard what was recorded until it was played back. T=
his sounds like a classic EVP thus far. The playback was easily heard by al=
l. The man recognized his own voice, including swear words; he had a pencha=
nt for swearing in his normal speech.]

Not personally having seen or heard=
 of  any documentation of this experiment, I am skeptical of it. But lets j=
ust say it is true and this really happened and as portrayed. This still do=
esn't prove in any way that most EVP's are caused by PK. Again, as I said e=
arlier, I am open to the possibility that it might happened in some rare ca=
ses.

---------------------------------------------------------------------=
-----------


[This anecdotal story would suggest that PK could be an expla=
nation for EVPs based on this single example alone.]

It only suggests that=
 PK *could* have played part on this particular case. To say that PK is res=
ponsible for most EVP-there has to be way more experimentation and testing =
that renders consistent results.

-----------------------------------------=
---------------------------------------


[Lastly we'll consider a recent e=
xperiment by Dr. Dean Radin. In this experiment, ...

This implies that ret=
rocausation could be at work during EVP production. And that suggests the i=
nvolvement of the operator as opposed to discarante entities manipulating t=
he environment.]

I have heard of this experiment. Still, it does not prove=
 that most EVP's are due to PK. All it *suggests* is that PK itself may be =
possible.

----------------------------------------------------------------=
----------------


IMO, if it were the case that most EVP's were caused by =
PK, we should have been able to prove that by now.

    Let's examine the supporting evidence a bit more closely. Fir=
st consider the potential link between healing and PK. Both phenomena can o=
ccur due to a local or distant agent. Absent healing for example would be t=
he distant analogy to distank or remote PK. Both have been studied in contr=
olled experiments. Dr Larry Dossy in Texas is one of the primary investigat=
ors in healing research. Both healing and general PK are reliably observed =
to be either intentional or spontaneous. So both exhibit similar traits. Bo=
th involve apparent manipulation by the mind of the physical environment. A=
nd certainly healing strongly implicates an indirect effect on complex syst=
ems. So it makes some sense that the two may indeed be related.

  Now let'=
s turn to the evidence for PK as an explanation for the EVP. A close collea=
gue of mine, a respected parapsychologist in Los Angeles, was working years=
 ago in a well-known haunted site in the Hollywood area. He recorded the vo=
ice of the home's owner, while standing next to the man. During this interv=
al the man did not speak; no one heard what was recorded until it was playe=
d back. This sounds like a classic EVP thus far. The playback was easily he=
ard by all. The man recognized his own voice, including swear words; he had=
 a penchant for swearing in his normal speech. This anecdotal story would s=
uggest that PK could be an explanation for EVPs based on this single exampl=
e alone. 

  Lastly we'll consider a recent experiment by Dr. Dean Radin. I=
n this experiment, mediators were asked to influence which paths photons wo=
uld take passing through one of two very tiny slits. You would expect this =
to occur normally by random chance, producing an equal distribution of phot=
ons in two regions on the target photograph. When uninfluenced, this is exa=
ctly what happened. When the mediator tried to 'block' one of the slits, th=
e distribution shifted, indicating success. But this is not what's importan=
t - it is necessary background. For the next trial, the machine was turned =
on and the exposure taken with no influence attempted. In fact, the mediata=
tor was not even present. The following day the mediatator was asked to inf=
luence the machine. He was not told the machine was turned off and could no=
t even record at that time. The next day the image was inspected for the fi=
rst time - the meditator again was not present. The image revealed a patter=
n similar to the one produced when the mediatator successfully "blocked" th=
e slit in the first trial. Theoretical physicst Dr. Richard Stroup suggeste=
d this indicated to him a demonstration of what he calls "retrocausation" -=
 a notion in theoretical physics that the future actually impacts on the pa=
st (as well as the past impacting the future as most people believe). Dr. R=
adin raised an interesting point with respect to designing experiments. He =
now wonders if investigators are so entangled with experiments that they un=
wittingly can influence outcomes even before the experiment is designed. Re=
member, these are trained academicians at the top of their respective field=
s. 

  This implies that retrocausation could be at work during EVP product=
ion. And that suggests the involvement of the operator as opposed to discar=
ante entities manipulating the environment.

  I have no problem with the n=
otion that external influences may indeed in some way mediate what is done;=
 I simply wonder if they are really manipulating sound directly.

  This is=
 what I could consider the evidence for the position I stated.

When you carefully consider what is being heard, the themes often seem to r=
eflect what may be subconscious concerns of the operator or the listener. I=
f external sources additionally inform this process of perception, it is qu=
ite possible they influence both what is recorded and how is later perceive=
