In my opinion, (based on years of experience with the paranormal and spiri=
ts in particular) I can say that it is very rare to run into any spirit bei=
ng that is any more "evil" than the average person,

My questions are:

 Wh=
at does evil sound like?

How do you 'know' something is evil from a record=
ing or an ITC session?

 

Spirits are like people - most of them ARE peopl=
e without bodies. They were not happy when they were alive and dying didn't=
 make them happier - same goes for mean people, dying doesn't make them nic=
e.

 

Some spirits, like people, enjoy scaring and intimidating others. Th=
ey want you to belive they are sonme big, bad demon when really they are an=
 insecure bully whose parents didn't care about him (or her)...

I see more "evil" amongst the living than anwhere else=
. As for negative 
speaking entities, I tend to ignore them the same as the=
 live negs. 
Sometimes its just a part of a persons character to take the n=
egative 
approach. The same goes for cussing, some people do it more than o=
thers.
