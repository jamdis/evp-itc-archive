Poltergeist phenomena could also explain why it gets quieter after ritual,
especially if the person from which the energy is stemming is involved in
the ritual. The ritual lets the person release this energy in a constructive
manner. After a while though, it builds back up.

Also, people have reported seeing glimpses of apparitions even in
poltergeist cases. So it is something for you to consider. That Jay sees the
apparition could mean that the energy is coming from him.

The good news is that if it is PK energy, it should go away eventually.
Since it seems to relax after ritual, you may try some experiments with
that. Have Jay do some personal ritual work and see if the phenomena
subsides. If it doesn&#x27;t subside, then do some personal ritual yourself and
see what happens. Just see if you can effect or find some patten to it. If
you are able to establish that it does consistently respond to ritual work
by either of you, then that may be your answer. You just need to do some
kind of regular ritual work to release the energy constructively.

Even if it is an actual entity, since ritual does seem to affect it, this
may still be your answer-maybe you can make a ritual around communicating
with it.

If it is an actual being, unfortunately there just is no sure fire method to
make them leave. I am sure you have run into this before in your work as a
medium - you can ask them to leave, but it&#x27;s just like asking a living
person to leave. If they don&#x27;t want to go, they won&#x27;t.

My suggestion in this case would be to keep trying to communicate with it.
Eventually hopefully you will get through to it.

&gt;
&gt; Have you considered that it may just be energy, and not a sentient being?
&gt;
&gt; It sounds like a typical poltergeist case.

&gt;&gt;  I am Annie. I have not written much but have visaully followed this
&gt;&gt; group over the past year. I have much experience in the realm of the
&gt;&gt; paranormal.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Here is the issue. Our home has an inhabitant that we cannot seem to
&gt;&gt; remove. It does not speak to us on the frank&#x27;s box nor will it communicate
&gt;&gt; through either me or my partner, Jay. We are both mediums. It slams and
&gt;&gt; bangs in the house almost ceaselessly at night. It hits the walls, windows,
&gt;&gt; the tv, the bedside tables and the doors. I am at a loss as to how to
&gt;&gt; otherwise communicate because as I said with the 2 boxes we have, it won&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; speak.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am open to any and all suggestions. We have told it to go, tried many
&gt;&gt; different suggested rituals and to no avail. It will go quiet for a day to
&gt;&gt; three days after ritual work but begins again, only louder.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Please, if anyone can help or direct us to someone who can I would be most
&gt;&gt; grateful.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sincerely,
