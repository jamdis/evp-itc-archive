Search for missing Moline woman &#x27;too dangerous&#x27; around dam
By Dustin Lemmon | Wednesday, September 24, 2008

UPDATED: Capt. Greg Hunter of the Illinois Conservation Police said a 
Moline woman was about 25 yards upstream when she was sucked in to 
the Rock River current and went over the Milan Steel Dam.

He said one conservation officer is searching the river today with 
local fire departments. They will probably search the water&#x27;s surface 
for Kristina Ornelis for three days before calling it off. She 
disappeared into the stream about 3 p.m. Tuesday.

Hunter said it is too dangerous around the dam to continue to drag 
the bottom or send in divers. He said two rescue workers had to be 
rescued from a boat yesterday after it was sucked into the flow.

&quot;It&#x27;s just too dangerous to do a recovery effort around that boil,&quot; 
he said. &quot;You simply can&#x27;t endanger the safety of the rescue workers.&quot;

A hydraulic just below the dam spins the water in a circle, kicking 
objects back toward the dam, Hunter said. He said even experienced 
rescue workers would be lucky to escape the hydraulic.

A boil or rise in the water that forms just past the hydraulic is 
considered the point of no return, Hunter said. Once past that point, 
a boat or person will be sucked under and trapped in the spin.

Mhisho Vuong of Davenport, said she was at the scene fishing with her 
boyfriend and his brother shortly before the incident happened. She 
didn&#x27;t know Ornelis or the two women she was with but said the women 
had a little boy and were wading into the water. She said her 
boyfriend had to help one of them out after the current started to 
pull the woman downstream.

&quot;We left just because we didn&#x27;t want to be there if something 
happened,&quot; she said, noting her boyfriend warned the women to be 
careful.

Hunter said Milan police are investigating to find out what happened 
before Ornelis was pulled downstream by the current. He noted that 
the dam is dangerous and that people should not be swimming or wading 
in the water when it is as high as it is now.

&quot;The public needs to realize how dangerous these are,&quot; he said. &quot;Low 
head dams are structures that need tremendous respect.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Hello Tammi,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am very sorry this has happened to you and your family.  I pray 
&gt; for 
&gt; &gt; the safe return of her, but if that is not possible I hope for a 
&gt; &gt; recovery so there is closure.
&gt; &gt; I also hope someone in our group is able to help locate an area 
to 
&gt; &gt; search.  I&#x27;m sure there are some in the group who are already 
&gt; working 
&gt; &gt; on your request.
&gt; &gt; We have many here who have been very successful at contacting 
those 
&gt; &gt; who may be able to help, using the numerous devices available.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m sure those involved will contact you if an answer is found.
&gt; &gt; Again, I pray for things to work out, you are in all our prayers.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; - Mike Coletta
