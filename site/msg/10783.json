You \nreceive what you are to receive for a purpose.  Others receive what \nthey are to receive, for a purpose. \n\nIt will all wash out in the end, Purple Princess of the Seven.  :)\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; From; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_St_Germain &#39;Saint \nGermain is always associated with the color violet, the jewel \namethyst, and the Maltese cross rendered in violet (usually the iron \ncross style cross patee version); he is also regarded as the &#39;Chohan \nof the Seventh Ray&#39;[13]  according to Theosophy, the Seven Rays are \nseven metaphysical principles that govern both individual souls and \nthe unfolding of each 2,158 year long Astrological Age. Since \naccording to Theosophy the next Astrological Age, the Age of \nAquarius, will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) Ray (the Ray of \nCeremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes called &#39;The Hierarch of \nthe Age of Aquarius&#39;. According to the Ascended Master Teachings, \nSaint Germain is &#39;The God of Freedom for the Earth&#39;.&#39;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Much to do with the Purple Princess, and the seven. I don&#39;t mean \nto sell others short, I just get a different level, and find \nregular &quot;this your auntie&quot; type EVPs kinda useless. Mostly I don&#39;t \npost every voice I get, just the ones that I thought was outstanding, \nbut no one else hears.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Make i&#39;m yours.
