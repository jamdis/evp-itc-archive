Especially the radio sweep\nmethod and EVPmaker are discussed quite controversially in this issue.\nAlec MacRae for instance wrote:\n\n---- begin quote ----\nLike EVPmaker, the swept receiver method is capable of producing EVP,\nbut it is also even more capable of producing false results. Some years\nago, I did a series of experiments with EVPmaker.... What EVPmaker does\nis take a few seconds of speech, chop it into little pieces called\nphonemes and then randomize these phonemes. If you are lucky, you will\nfind EVP.\n\nWhat some people do, frustrated at not getting very much, is they make\nthe slices wider, so then what you are getting are actually sizeable\nlittle chunks of the sentence. Actual words are still there. In that\ncase you seem to be getting more EVP, but what you are getting is simply\na rearranged sentence.\n---- end quote ----\n\nMy comment on this:\n\nIf only phonemes are used, as is the case for the SpeakJet allophones\nfile, this won&#39;t happen, since this source material definitely doesn&#39;t\nalready contain speech. In order to rule out doubts as to getting &quot;false\nEVPs&quot;, only audio sources should be used in the future which aren&#39;t\nalready finished speech. So perhaps using SJ allophones are one step\ntowards the right direction. Interesting, that this comes up right now...\n\nStefan"}
