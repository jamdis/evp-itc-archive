A \n&gt; floor model was all that was available at my local radio shack.  I \n&gt; was getting a pretty crappy AM signal because of the rain, but it \n&gt; works.  I try to leave the files barely touched to leave the \n&gt; authentic value for listeners.  I can get plenty 469&#39;s, i can always \n&gt; pick one up and send it to you.  The original files from saturday \n&gt; were from the FM from the 469, that mod took less than 5 minutes to \n&gt; do.  The 470 old style is probably your best bet if you can find it \n&gt; because it has the built in speaker, but it&#39;s really hard to find.  \n&gt; It&#39;s not the black one, it&#39;s grey.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; These are very clean.
