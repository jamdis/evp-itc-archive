That&#39;s why I put in both modes (on new boxes), I think at times \nrandom will better, and at other times, linear will work better. Sometimes \nthe aluminum echo box works better, and sometimes you need something else, \nlike the wave guide box. Maybe it also depends on what level is coming \nthrough. There seems to be various level of spirits, like seperate \nexistances. I used to get my mother in-law on EVPmaker, but in one session \nthey said &quot;she got a new body and moved up two steps&quot;, and never heard from \nher again. There&#39;s so many variables!\n\nFrank-S\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Box 13 voices.\n&gt;Date: Thu, 12 Jul 2007 04:50:45 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;I don&#39;t know Frank, call me a fan of retro tech gear - I think it look\n&gt;really cool plus it&#39;s got an illuminated meter. And even though you&#39;re\n&gt;now embracing linear sweep, RVG still seems like a way for the spirits\n&gt;to manipulate the energy to assemble messages through the tuner. -Bill\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nhttp://imagine-windowslive.com/hotmail/?locale=en-us&ocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_mini_pcmag_0507"}
