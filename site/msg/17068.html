<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Whenever I think I have an EVP, I always run a poll on all my message boards
to see first if people hear anything at all, then second, what it is they
think they hear.

If most people hear the same thing, then you can be reasonably certain it
isn&#x27;t just pareidolia. On my last round, everyone unanimously agreed they
heard a male voice, but what they thought it said varied widely. But I was
satisfied because no men were present when it was recorded, so I know at
least there was some other voice there. In this case, what it said wasn&#x27;t as
important as just knowing it was there.

If no one or only a few hear the same thing though, then I have to assume it
is just paredolia.

&gt; Are your recordings EVPS?  If so, if you&#x27;d like to post some of them, I&#x27;m
&gt; sure people here would be interested in listening, and you might benefit
&gt; from a third party&#x27;s interpretation, to see if it matches your own
&gt; interpretation.  Sometimes, when you are with other people, and one person
&gt; says they hear a word on a recording, the others start to hear it too (but
&gt; not before). As has been mentioned, a possible reason is what has been
&gt; called paradolia (same kind of thing when you point to a cloud and say you
&gt; see a dragon, then someone else is able to see it too).
&gt;
&gt; For this kind of test though, please don&#x27;t tell anyone what you think the
&gt; recording says when you post it, and don&#x27;t name the file with a name that
&gt; describes it. That&#x27;s the cloud-dragon danger if you do.

&gt; Lizzie, I don&#x27;t write here often. In fact, this is my third time in
&gt; responding to other than my question yesterday.
&gt;
&gt; I HEAR what you are saying. I was skeptical , even as a medium, of my
&gt; abilities, what I would see, hear, feel and receive, even when witnessed by
&gt; others and including physical manifestation.
&gt;
&gt; I got some &quot;hard evidence&quot; last June and throughout the rest of 2009. We
&gt; obtained/ photographed and have unretouched photos from within our home, K
&gt; meter readings, videos of our lights &amp; stereo/tv turning itself off and on ,
&gt; including changing channels with NO person being responsible, NO
&gt; intereference that could have caused it and outside witnesses to said
&gt; activities.Please bear with me if I am not overly clear or you feel things
&gt; are left out, I will always answer questions! * smile * We have hours of
&gt; recordings, both video and audio, of the goings ons in our home and those of
&gt; others, my partner Jay &amp; I have met.
&gt;
&gt; Let&#x27;s talk, discuss this. Okay? I am more than willing to hear you out.

&gt; No I don&#x27;t have a spirit box, a Franks Box or anything like that.  And no,
&gt; I do not want one.
&gt;
&gt; I have been involved with this research a long time, been a paranormal
&gt; researcher for a long time, with ten years of real investigative work under
&gt; my belt to boot.
&gt;
&gt; I am not cutting anyone down at the knees here, not insulting anyones work
&gt; or personal beliefs.
&gt;
&gt; But this onslaught of betterment against logical thought and questioning is
&gt; a bit troubling, do you not think?  Can we not hear both sides?
&gt;
&gt; Not every Skeptic is out to get you!  But you might be asked a few
&gt; questions.  And in the long run of things, what is will be.  There is no one
&gt; &quot;OUT TO GET YOU&quot;
&gt;
&gt; That is not the nature of discovery or of Science.  If, people are talking
&gt; to dead people with (Effectively) broken radios, lets see the facts and
&gt; analyze it.  Let&#x27;s test it! Let&#x27;s get to the bottom of it.
&gt;
&gt; Let us really, really look at it.
&gt;
&gt; If anything like that was ever able to be proven as a solid Scientific
&gt; principle or fact, it would be monumental.  It would be Earth shattering and
&gt; completely change how we view logic and science as we know it.
&gt;
&gt; So if this is real, lets look at it. Lets try and be objective about it?
&gt;
&gt; What is wrong with that?

&gt;  Do you have a spirit box and do sessions to communicate with the spirits?

&gt; I am angry because I feel personally berated, as a Human with a thinking
&gt; mind or brain!
&gt;
&gt; Why am I here?  To see if there is really anything to this idea and
&gt; theory.  So far I am not seeing a whole lot other than people being pissed
&gt; off at the questioning of ideas.
&gt;
&gt; If this is real, lets see it.  Get over all this &quot;Skeptic&quot; crap and prove
&gt; the point.  I am gong to say it one more time, if this is a question of
&gt; faith or religion, WONDERFUL!  Best of luck with it!  I got no problem with
&gt; the idea.  If you don&#x27;t want your ideas questioned, or it is a mater of
&gt; Faith, that is fine. But say so, and while you are at it, don&#x27;t kick the
&gt; rest of us that are honestly looking at thing for what they are, not what we
&gt; want them to be!
&gt;
&gt; But, when you put it out there as a statement of fact, and then ride the
&gt; asses of anyone that questions it, I got more than a problem with it.
&gt;
&gt; I have sat back and been a member here for a long time. Keep my mouth shut,
&gt; but this is more than crossing the line.
&gt;
&gt; If it is real, than lets look at it.  But when we look at it, lets look at
&gt; what we know to be the truth and lets take all of that data into
&gt; consideration and discernment before coming to a conclusion.
&gt;
&gt; That is not to much to ask!

&gt; I am confused about two issues. First, Why the angry emails?  I don&#x27;t think
&gt; I have seen this before with this group. Also, I don&#x27;t get why anyone who is
&gt; a skeptic would belong to this group.? I mean no disrespect , just curious.

&gt; You are ever bit as bad as Randi or any of them!  You are just the
&gt; flip-side of the coin!
&gt;
&gt; Your misuse of the word, &quot;Skeptic&quot; has taken on a totally new meaning.  You
&gt; see anyone that has a problem with your half baked ideas, and insanity, yeah
&gt; I said it, as a &quot;Skeptic.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Maybe it would do you some good to research the word and idea behind it
&gt; before you go off half cocked as you are.  The world is not out to get you
&gt; or your damned box!  If there is any truth to it, the let&#x27;s see the evidence
&gt; of it.  Lets look at it for what it is, NOT WHAT YOU OR ANYONE WANTS IT TO
&gt; BE!
&gt;
&gt; What it is, no more and no less!
&gt;
&gt; I am a Skeptic, it the true sense of the word.  And I have been holding my
&gt; tongue hoping you would pull out of this crap.  Frank, get a grip!
&gt;
&gt; Not everyone that disagrees with you is out to get you!  I have real
&gt; problems with the whole theory, but I have never questioned your heart
&gt; or integrity over it.  (Well, other than letting Moon play the dance he is
&gt; playing with YOUR BOX!)
&gt;
&gt; But, lets analytically look at this for what it is and find the truth of
&gt; it?  If you want to turn it into a religion that is on top of some mountain,
&gt; so be it!  But other people are not going to see the subject in black and
&gt; white standards.
&gt;
&gt; Give it a rest and thinks about it.  The world is not out to get you Frank!

&gt;  I know what it is, even though I can&#x27;t even spell it or pronounce it. It&#x27;s
&gt; what the skeptics and debunkers tout as the answer to all paranormal
&gt; experience. I think we ought to pull our claws back in, especially me!
&gt;
&gt;  I have gotten &quot;voices&quot; that I thought were perfectly clear, and no one
&gt; else could hear it, and some I found was just a snippet of music, so yeah,
&gt; that happens, but it does not eliminate or explain everything from the
&gt; boxes, and other EVP methods, you  just have to be aware of the possibility.
&gt; Anotherr problem is broadcast fragments, sometimes they are just what they
&gt; sound like, an ad for one thing or another, sometimes they can have
&gt; sychronistic meaning, and sometimes they can be altered in some way to form
&gt; a messages, such as the recent one I had about learning sex, which was
&gt; seemingly ignored by all cuz it has the &quot;s&quot; word--I guess. The fragments can
&gt; also be distorted as the radio tuning is swept across a station, I don&#x27;t
&gt; accept every word and syllable as meaning something. You have tio judge
&gt; mnessage by content and personal meaning.
&gt;
&gt;  I have seen faces stand up in a carpet right in front of me, not something
&gt; I just happened across, something that happened live as I watched. For
&gt; someone to suggest that&#x27;s imagination I find very offensive.
&gt;
&gt;  When I first switched to a linear sweep in the boxes, I could hear nothing
&gt; but gibberish, then suddenly I could hear &quot;them&quot; speaking. I doubt that is
&gt; all imagination either, I think the mind(which is not brain) has to
&gt; reprogram the ears, which are brain, to hear.  I also think the skeptics can
&gt; not allow this programming to take place, hence they can&#x27;t hear. I would be
&gt; very surprised if any of the hard core skeptics even turned on a box for
&gt; fear that they may hear something that&#x27;s not there. Rorke(the Phd) implied
&gt; as much when he wanted a box to test, or more like debunk. That crap is
&gt; frikkin&#x27; pathetic!

&gt; this pseudo scientific BS for 10 years, so I&#x27;m a bit touchy. Science
&gt; explains the paranormal away, and yet people continune to photograph images,
&gt; and get their names, and the names of deseased loved ones through EVP, as
&gt; well as questions answered, and science(althogh not all scientists) just
&gt; ignores these inconvinient facts and focuses on that we might see things
&gt; that are not there, which I disagree with as well.
&gt;
&gt;  Did you even bother looking at the image on the group home page. That was
&gt; from sweeping a TV tuner with a random voltage and video recording the
&gt; monitor screen. So explain away why there is a wolf image embedded in the
&gt; guy&#x27;s hat, an image of an alien below his ear, and why in God&#x27;s name does he
&gt; resembles the classic description of an MIB or Shadow Person?  Pareidolia no

 I know wha i is, e en hough I can&#x27; e en spell i o p onounce i . I &#x27;s wha he skep ics and debunke s ou as he answe o all pa ano mal expe ience. I hink we ough o pull ou claws back in, especially me!

 
 I ha e go en &quot; oices&quot; ha I hough we e pe ec ly clea , and no one else could hea i , and some I ound was jus  a snippe o music, so yeah, ha happens, bu i does no elimina e o explain e e y hing om he boxes, and o he EVP me hods, you  jus ha e o be awa e o he possibili y. Ano he p oblem is b oadcas agmen s, some imes hey a e jus wha hey sound like, an ad o one hing o ano he , some imes hey can ha e sych onis ic meaning, and some imes hey can be al e ed in some way o o m a messages, such as he ecen one I had abou lea ning sex, which was seemingly igno ed by all cuz i has he &quot;s&quot; wo d--I guess. The agmen s can also be dis o ed as he adio uning is swep ac oss a s a ion, I don&#x27; accep e e y wo d and syllable as meaning some hing. You ha e io judge mnessage by con en and pe sonal meaning. 

 
 I ha e seen aces s and up in a ca pe igh in on o me, no some hing I jus happened ac oss, some hing ha happened li e as I wa ched. Fo someone o sugges ha &#x27;s imagina ion I ind e y o ensi e.  
 
 When I i s swi ched o a linea sweep in he boxes, I could hea no hing bu gibbe ish, hen suddenly I could hea &quot; hem&quot; speaking. I doub ha is all imagina ion ei he , I hink he mind(which is no b ain) has o ep og am he ea s, which a e b ain, o hea .  I also hink he skep ics can no allow his p og amming o ake place, hence hey can&#x27; hea . I would be e y su p ised i any o he ha d co e skep ics e en u ned on a box o ea ha hey may hea some hing ha &#x27;s no he e. Ro ke( he Phd) implied as much when he wan ed a box o es , o mo e like debunk. Tha c ap is ikkin&#x27; pa he ic!
