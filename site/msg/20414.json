It&#39;s really\ntricky to get varactors to gang-tune both at the same time. You&#39;d need\nto put trimmers in parallel with the varactors and then try to get\nthem to track.\n\nSome of the air variables also have the last set of plates on one end\ncut with slots so separate sections of the capacitor are bent to\nfurther fine-tune the tracking. So the air variables may not even\nchange at the same rate.This is difficult to do with varactors.\n\nIt could probably be done but I wonder if it&#39;s worth your time.\n\nGood luck!\n\nZack\n\n\nOn 1/27/11, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  This one leaves much to be desired, for one thing, it&#39;s only getting the\n&gt; top third of AM, even though the oscillatro is coveriing the band. Can&#39;t\n&gt; get the antenna to resonate. Sooo, had a couple junkers with the saem chip,\n&gt; TDA2003 so I&#39;ll try one from scratch.\n&gt;\n&gt;  At 5 seconds &quot;I feel for Frank---So sad&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; F-S\n&gt;"}
