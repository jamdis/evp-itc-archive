<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

However, without people (such as the TAPS team and Chris Moon, etc.) who are willing to give up their privacy to interest others in this work, we wouldn&#x27;t have as many people (and new research discoveries) in this field.

For over a year, I&#x27;d heard about the box from many people, all of whom told me it was about the same as the Shack Hack.  Umm... no. Chris Moon is the one who showed me how it really works, and I&#x27;m grateful for that.  

However, I&#x27;m mostly enjoying this gorgeous holiday weekend, and I hope everyone else is having a fine May weekend, as well.

Cheerfully,
Fiona

&gt;  Yeah, I know. People that think they can make a name for themselves
&gt; debunking, and the ones wanting to sell their own versions of the box. Many
&gt; want to be TAPS and Chirs Moon. I don&#x27;t understand it. One thing though,
&gt; without Moon, no one would know about the box! It&#x27;s these skeptics and
&gt; debunkers that try to make him look bad.
&gt; 
&gt;  I don&#x27;t know what the answer is.
