&gt; I alway had the EVP thing happen to me on a nomal radio. I tried to explain that 
&gt; I had EVPs on the radio since the early 70&#x27;s. Back then people would think EVP 
&gt; was evil and many would attack me even though I was under age. I also explained 
&gt; EVP to many people because I had a vision of how too do Ghostbox by flipping the 
&gt; radio dial. I also explained: Songs can be used like Tarot cards! Anything can 
&gt; speak to a person like the wind for example..
&gt; 
&gt; Besides having visions I also used to sing songs on the radio years before they 
&gt; came out. The news recorded me many times singing songs and warning of things 
&gt; before they happened. That&#x27;s how I got to do movie/rock star readings and warned 
&gt; of things like 9/11 to politicians and put things in the media like &quot;The plane! 
&gt; The plane!&quot; on Fantacy Island. http://youtu.be/_xG7Qwv23sg that would warn of 
&gt; the 9/11 terror attacks or actually warning of the conspiricy with-in and that 
&gt; someone was doing something.
&gt; The 9/11 emergency phone number is also a warning of  9/11 terror attacks and 
&gt; the feeling someone was going to do something.
&gt; What I am saying is I was there (in the 70&#x27;s)with the politicians in Canada 
&gt; warning of 9/11 to Americain politicians saying we would make the emergency 
&gt; phone number the same accross north America and what the number meant. 
&gt; 
&gt; We also spoke of the TV shows that warned of 9/11. Fantacy Island, SCTV and many 
&gt; other tv shows or songs that would have a 9/11 feeling. SCTV is a great example 
&gt; of this where all of Canada was saying &quot;Take-off eh. Like you know eh, you 
&gt; hosers you know.&quot; It even became a hit song. http://youtu.be/1BFPt001PYU Rush 
&gt; sang with the SCTV comediens Bob and Doug and it became a large part of a 
&gt; Canadian&#x27;s identity, &quot;Like you know,eh?&quot;(a psychic expression like we all know)
&gt; I did this type of thing for many TV shows, movies, songs and politicians of 
&gt; many countries. I put my image in some of it and it shows too.
&gt; The whole time people have been trying to dismiss me, get me to loose me 
&gt; jobs,loose  girlfriend and  friends. And People tried to kill me. My 
&gt; ex-girlfriend said my baby it not mine and everyone believes her, so I lost my 
&gt; kid!
&gt; Now I am a psychic for adviser network.

&gt;  I don&#x27;t know how many hundreds of box voices I have posted over the years, and 
&gt; few if any are heard by anyone, yet if I use other methods, like EVPmaker, or as 
&gt; recently, just pushing the buttons on my truck radio while recoding,  others 
&gt; hear what I hear.
