<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just FYI. I am no longer connected to Haunted Times in any way, except Chris 
Moon can keep and use the Ghost Boxes he has, I won&#x27;t be supplying anymore.  
I very much dislike the concept, and activity of &quot;ghost huning&quot;, there too 
many egos, associated wiht it, to many that think they are the worlds only 
paranoramal experts, and way too much focus on the negative, and &quot;scary&quot; 
aspects.  My systems are not designed for that ....stuff, and I can&#x27;t 
support those activities, even it means that I don&#x27;t personaly put any more 
of my boxes out there in the public. The information for making this stuff 
is out there, and others can build this stuff, and do whatever they want 
with it. I doubt if there will be many &quot;Frank&#x27;s Box&quot; clones out there, while 
the circuits are straight forward, it takes the &quot;certain understanding&quot; to 
get it to work.

Frank
