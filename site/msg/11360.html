<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi everyone, 

My name is Angela, I am 30 years old, married mother of two. Been 
interested in the paranormal for as long as I can remember. Was 
recently in an investigation group but the leader was a very pushy, 
obnoxious individual that basically scared everyone off. Anyway...

I was listening to some of the files. Nice work! However some of them 
won&#x27;t open, when I try to open some of them I get a message that 
says &quot;Windows Media Player cannot find the file&quot; or cannot open the 
file something like that...anyone know why some files play and others 
won&#x27;t? 

Also...I am interested in capturing EVPs myself. However I don&#x27;t have 
much equipment. 

I have a computer of course, and a pair of stereo quality headphones 
with microphone attached (like the kind a call center would use) My 
computer is right next to our air conditioner so that could provide 
the &quot;white noise&quot; 

Could I possibly record with nothing more than a headphone mouthpiece 
and a freeware program like Audacity? Or do I need something more 
extensive? 

Also are there any risks of doing EVP in one&#x27;s home? I don&#x27;t suspect 
paranormal activity here but I read Tom and Lisa Butler&#x27;s book &quot;There 
is No Death and There are No Dead&quot; where they talk about making 
contact with &quot;The Other Side&quot; even in locations that are 
not &quot;haunted&quot; such as one&#x27;s home. 

Any suggestions, tips, advice, input would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks! 
Angela</pre>
