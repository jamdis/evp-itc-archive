<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Most of the time I&#x27;m so busy building the junk I don&#x27;t take time to
actually use it. My right ear has about 1/4 the sensitvity of the left ear,
maybe less, I miss alot. Some of these voices are my ET guys and some are
posers that confuse everything.

&gt; Frank,
&gt;
&gt; Yeah, you do get them talking about you. It seems like there is a lot of
&gt; conversation between many voices here and they are talking about calling. At
&gt; .08, somebody is tee&#x27;d off.
&gt;
&gt; There is something to labeling affecting subliminal interpretation. When I
&gt; read your interpretation of the &quot;jesus&quot; line at the beginning, that is what
&gt; I heard through the speakers first and foremost. I turned the speakers off
&gt; and used studio grade headphones for analysis. Voila, no Jesus. I guess he
&gt; was resurrected from this clip! I often wonder if the sound waves between
&gt; speaker and listener are manipulated in some way. This is why I like to
&gt; listen in enclosed headphones, that way your ear is directly against the
&gt; sound source.
&gt;
&gt; That said, this is what I hear from your clip:
&gt;
&gt; @.01: &quot;He&#x27;s calling you, he&#x27;s a (unclear)&quot; (male, electronic)
&gt; @.03: It amounts to scheisse
&gt; @.05: &quot;Make sure he has the date&quot; (male)
&gt; @.06: &quot;May Eighteenth&quot; (electronic)
&gt; @.08: &quot;Fuck this guy&quot; (male)
&gt; @.09: Singing - &quot;He doesn&#x27;t call her, call her (?anymore?)&quot; (female)
&gt; @.12: He doesn&#x27;t seem to reply (male)
&gt; @.13: Steve (?Coogle? - unclear)
&gt;
&gt; I know you typically don&#x27;t interact with the box by asking questions, but
&gt; have you ever tried telling them to communicate one at a time? It works for
&gt; me most of the time when multiple voices crowd the box. Regardless, they
&gt; definitely like communicating with you. I find the electronic voices and
&gt; tones you get most interesting; they remind me of spiricom audio.

&gt; &gt; A 6 seconds &quot;make sure he has the date--the 17th&quot;, as two seem to talk
&gt; back
&gt; &gt; and forth. Yet another pick up date? I keep saying I still have stuff to
&gt; do,
&gt; &gt; but now the talk about using force.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Starts out &quot;he calls like I&#x27;m Jesus..&quot; it gets head warping weird.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I really doubt these are acidental &quot;captures&quot;, as I don&#x27;t have a set time
&gt; &gt; to record.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I have found that they do talk among themselves all the time. A lot of
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; time, they are talking about me like I am not even there. In some of
&gt; those
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; clips, you can definitely hear them talking amongst themselves.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The main voice you hear (especially in clip 4) is my technician, or as
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; call him, my facilitator. He is the one telling Raudive to ask his
&gt; question
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and telling an Other to wait. I have numerous clips where I will ask a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; question and I can hear him ask the same question of the Others. This
&gt; is all
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the personal proof I need (besides my name and facts about my life
&gt; coming
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; through a broken radio). To hear your own words coming through the
&gt; radio in
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a different voice is something that should be considered
&gt; impossible...but
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; then to get an answer back from those reiterated words, well, I
&gt; consider
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that pretty damn good evidence that there is an intelligence trying to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; communicate.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; But then again, any scientist can easily say that I was experiencing
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; nothing more that a Ham radio operator having fun at my expense. My
&gt; only
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; come back to this is that since I still a ghost hunter, I have
&gt; traveled
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; extensively to different locations. I have been bringing my box out in
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the field for location experiments. Guess what? My facilitator speaks
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; every spot, in every state that I have tried this in.
