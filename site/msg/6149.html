&gt; Ann  I will be happy to ask.  This is actually the first (two)  
&gt; messages that I personally believe I heard so it will be a stretch  
&gt; for me, probably, to both ask a question and get a response.  Nice  
&gt; thought...someday, maybe...hopefully.  I will test it tomorrow at  
&gt; the same time of day and location outside...probably no rain  
&gt; though.  From Mexico   Ron L

&gt; Ron,

&gt; I do have someone close to me on the other side names Helen who I  
&gt; have been asking after. Perhaps you can ask if this Helen is for me.

&gt;&gt; I am posting two short sessions for hopefully others to comment  
&gt;&gt; on.  This is completed with a RS 469 going directly into my  
&gt;&gt; handheld digital recorder.  Coincidentally, I am outside in a  
&gt;&gt; light rain so maybe it is ideal for me here in Mexico where I get  
&gt;&gt; few signals.
&gt;&gt; At first I thought I heard the word BUENO (hello in Spanish) but I  
&gt;&gt; now hear DINO with is my wife&#x27;s name...short for Dinorah.  She is  
&gt;&gt; normally not with me for sessions and was not with me for this  
&gt;&gt; session so I doubt what I am hearing.  Any comments would be  
&gt;&gt; appreciated.
&gt;&gt; The other recording I hear the name HELEN.  I don&#x27;t know anyone  
&gt;&gt; with that name.  Ron L
