I can&#39;t make  out any clear words. Sure-I could probably \n&gt; matrix some in, but that  is all it would be.\n&gt; \n&gt; For an EVP to be considered proof  positive of spirit communication by \nthe \n&gt; community at large, it has to  be clear enough that many people hear the \n&gt; same thing, without hints  or coaxing. If you have to have high quality \ndevices \n&gt; to make it out,  it just isn&#39;t good enough. That does not mean it isn&#39;t a \n&gt; true EVP,  just that it isn&#39;t good enough to stand as evidence.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for  the whistle, it sounded like feedback to me as well, but I will \n&gt; have  to take you word for it that you were no where near any other \nelectronics  \n&gt; or EMF&#39;s that could contribute to feedback. Even so, if I am trying  to \n&gt; remain unbiased and objective, there is no way for me to say this  is a \nspirit, \n&gt; without personally being with you when you caught it.  The only thing I \ncan \n&gt; still say about it is could be, but for me it is  non conclusive.\n&gt; \n&gt; If someone does not hear what you are  hearing, try to remain objective \nand \n&gt; just understand that it isn&#39;t  personal. You have to understand that with \n&gt; just these recordings  alone, there is no way to scientifically prove \nwhat \n&gt; you have recorded  is spirit communication. If you could get consistent, \n&gt; intelligent  question and answer recordings, then you would be alot \ncloser.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Here again, we are back to the &quot;So what?&quot; thing. You don&#39;t HAVE to  prove \n&gt; anything scientifically, unless you want others to completely  believe in \n&gt; your evidence.\n&gt; \n&gt; The theory that is being  kicked around is that some EVP&#39;s are personal, \n&gt; and only meant for the  person recording them to hear. If this is the \ncase, no \n&gt; matter how  clear something is to you, others may not hear it.\n&gt; \n&gt;  April\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----  \n&gt; From: _James W.

I does have a cadence similar to someone \n  s=\r\npeaking, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; but it could just as easily be something present in the \n=\r\n  environment-&lt;WBR&gt;it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; could just as easily be something present in=\r\n the \n  environment-&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;a na it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; just too feint. I c=\r\nan&#39;t make \n  out any clear words. Sure-I could probably &lt;BR&gt;&gt; matrix som=\r\ne in, but that \n  is all it would be.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; For an EVP to be con=\r\nsidered proof \n  positive of spirit communication by the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; community=\r\n at large, it has to \n  be clear enough that many people hear the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nsame thing, without hints \n  or coaxing. If you have to have high quality d=\r\nevices &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to make it out, \n  it just isn&#39;t good enough. That does not=\r\n mean it isn&#39;t a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; true EVP, \n  just that it isn&#39;t good enough to st=\r\nand as evidence.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As for \n  the whistle, it sounded like fe=\r\nedback to me as well, but I will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; have \n  to take you word for it t=\r\nhat you were no where near any other electronics \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; or EMF&#39;s that =\r\ncould contribute to feedback. Even so, if I am trying \n  to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; remain=\r\n unbiased and objective, there is no way for me to say this \n  is a spirit,=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; without personally being with you when you caught it. \n  The only=\r\n thing I can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; still say about it is could be, but for me it is \n  n=\r\non conclusive.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If someone does not hear what you are \n  he=\r\naring, try to remain objective and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; just understand that it isn&#39;t \n=\r\n  personal. You have to understand that with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; just these recordings=\r\n \n  alone, there is no way to scientifically prove what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; you have r=\r\necorded \n  is spirit communication. If you could get consistent, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; i=\r\nntelligent \n  question and answer recordings, then you would be alot closer=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Here again, we are back to the &quot;So what?&quot; thing. You =\r\ndon&#39;t HAVE to \n  prove &lt;BR&gt;&gt; anything scientifically, unless you want ot=\r\nhers to completely \n  believe in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; your evidence.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; T=\r\nhe theory that is being \n  kicked around is that some EVP&#39;s are personal, &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; and only meant for the \n  person recording them to hear.
