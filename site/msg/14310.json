The  labels you give can influence the listeners: \nwhen you have a sound that  could be several things, and you note that it \nsounded like &quot;keep it moving&quot;,  the listener can find it nearly impossible to try \nNOT to hear what you  heard, and so not be able to give a fresh perspecive \nto help your research  methods.\n\n--- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) ,  &quot;James \nW.
