<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

I hear &quot;date is&quot; then &quot;Hebron,&quot; very clearly.  Then there&#x27;s something I still can&#x27;t get -- two words -- and the word &quot;run&quot; (or something like it) seems to be in there.  After that, it&#x27;s too choppy for me to understand.  

However, my experiences so far have been a few Shack Hack sessions, only one of which impressed me, as well as listening to Chris Moon&#x27;s conversations with a Frank&#x27;s box in Canada during May.  The box spoke so clearly in Canada, I&#x27;m still astonished.

So, I don&#x27;t have enough experience with EVP/ITC to identify anything except the most clear voices and speech.

What I listened for in this recording was what I heard in Canada, and what I&#x27;ve heard on several recordings posted to this list: A consistent voice in terms of tone, accent, and speech patterns.

In this recording, &quot;Date is,&quot; &quot;Hebron,&quot; and something before (and including) the word &quot;run&quot; all sound consistent to me. I&#x27;m hearing that exact same voice tone (male) towards the end of the recording, but I just can&#x27;t make out the words.  I hear a K sound, but that&#x27;s all I can say for sure.

Meanwhile, at the PEAR/Global Consciousness project, I&#x27;m seeing more downward spikes than normal, as of Monday.  (Tuesday&#x27;s data isn&#x27;t online yet, but yesterday&#x27;s movie was pretty good. Watch the egg blips around South America and Japan.)

I&#x27;m not sure if this is enough to signify an event about to happen.  Usually, the numbers make the most sense in hindsight.  That&#x27;s part of the learning curve as people try to understand what&#x27;s causing the RNG spikes.

For those who just can&#x27;t get enough predictive intrigue, there&#x27;s also a linguistic-based anomaly study, the Web Bot project, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Bot (further explained at http://www.halfpasthuman.com/altaprocess.html )

According to Wikipedia, July 8th is predicted as significant.  I don&#x27;t have the current Shape report (http://www.halfpasthuman.com/), so I don&#x27;t know what (if anything) they&#x27;ve predicted for June.

I hardly ever watch the news, but I may start watching for a few days, out of curiosity.

It&#x27;s funny, but watching for events around the 17th has some of the anticipation of the first day of school, with a hefty dose of similar anxieties as well.

Cheerfully,
Fiona

&gt; We&#x27;ll do a little test, see if anyone else the world hears what I do.
