<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Actually, it was not cool at all!  This spirit attached to my 23 year old
daughter in a very hostile and perverted way.  I have an evp I got in her
room...I had asked, &quot;Why are you here?&quot;  I got &quot; to f--k.&quot; in a very
gutteral tone.  It was awful.  Thank God he is gone now and can never
return.

&gt; That sounds interesting, and Carol you said the spirit followed you home
&gt; from Waverly... Thats cool, and I would try to get to know the
&gt; energy/spirit.

&gt; Andrea,
&gt; I have experienced this before. In my case it had to do with a spirit
&gt; that attached itself to us while at Waverly. It became very strong, and I
&gt; had to have assistance to rid my home of him. We also experienced very
&gt; dense, black masses moving towards us.

&gt;&gt; Hi Andrea,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sounds like a vortex may have been opening up in your hallway. Have you
&gt;&gt; had
&gt;&gt; any paranormal ativity in your house before?

&gt;&gt; Hi All,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am Andrea Carr who is a 41 year old wife and mom of 1 daughter. I am
&gt;&gt; sorry
&gt;&gt; I have not written before but I have a terrible year and haven&#x27;t had the
&gt;&gt; time to concentrate on EVP like I had prior. I won&#x27;t get into the
&gt;&gt; details
&gt;&gt; but it
&gt;&gt; has left me in the midst of OK just trying to pull through all of this
&gt;&gt; BS
&gt;&gt; &amp;
&gt;&gt; I will get back to it when I can.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Unfortunatley I am leaving for the weekend tomorrow morning and won&#x27;t
&gt;&gt; see
&gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt; e-mails until Monday morning.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have a question for any one here. I believe in aliens, spirit and
&gt;&gt; ghost
&gt;&gt; communications via evp but tonight I had an experience I never had
&gt;&gt; before.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I woke up at exactly 2:22 by my stove&#x27;s clock and went and cleaned my
&gt;&gt; sink
&gt;&gt; of dishes while I heated up some cream chipped beef (albiet not too
&gt;&gt; exciting)
&gt;&gt; but while I sat there after in the dark with my family sleeping my
&gt;&gt; hallway
&gt;&gt; ilummating a light clored blue several times. Anyone else ever seen
&gt;&gt; this?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I look forward to any responses.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks!
&gt;&gt; Andrea
