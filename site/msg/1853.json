These first two are to make it works, and every thing&#39;s cosher.\nYou have to draw the layout using their cad software, then e-mail it with \ncredit card #.\n\nFrank-S\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;bhali333&quot; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] a couple of new evp&#39;s from fm sweep(one about purple \n&gt;lady)\n&gt;Date: Mon, 13 Aug 2007 20:46:49 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;hey guy&#39;s\n&gt;here are a couple from the last session. I believe I am having great\n&gt;sucess with this method. I am in the process of trying to get a box\n&gt;built but the the electronics companies I have contacted seem to be too\n&gt;busy to do one board. If I&#39;m doing so well with this manual sweep I\n&gt;can&#39;t wait to see how a box works out. anyway give a listen and let me\n&gt;know what you think.\n&gt;\n&gt;bruce\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nSee what you���re getting into���before you go there \nhttp://newlivehotmail.com/?ocid=TXT_TAGHM_migration_HM_viral_preview_0507"}
