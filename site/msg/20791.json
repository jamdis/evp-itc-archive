With very very low frequencies (long timing periods), the internal leakage of the capacitor starts to degrade the short term accuracy of the timing - but this would be for a sweep period waveform of 3 minutes or more, so its not really a problem for the usual sweep periods of 3 to 10 seconds or so.\nHope this helps.\nregards,\nJEFF\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Luis&quot; &lt;luispucp098@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; hi , i have an important question , in linear sweep circuit , whith opamp , what is the minimum frecuency it can have ?... i ask this because , considering the recomendation of time 3 s 0-8v , the frecuency will be 0.16 hertz . This circuit can work whith this frecuency ? ...\n&gt;"}
