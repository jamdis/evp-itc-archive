<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, that worked. The story is a bit misleading (my misused word 
this week.) What I got when I went to the GHU there last year was it 
was two lesbian lovers, and a boyfriend or husband caught them in 
the act. But that conflicted with the &quot;mystery&quot; and romance 
surrounding the main story of the haunitng, so it was dismissed. It 
was the first clue I got that my boxes were being mis-used, and mis-
represented to the public by this particular user, who tends to pick 
and choose the &quot;evidence&quot; that comes through, and even create what 
he wants to hear.

 Thanks for the story!
