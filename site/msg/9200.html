<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce.  The same action can be taken (sharing the information about how to hack the 
radios) for the purpose of education, in the spirit of furthering the research OR in the 
spirit of punishment.  Some might think that the first reason is positive and the second 
negative.  But, in truth, there probably is not be a clear line of distinction in this instance.  

I realize you did not initially suggest researchers on this board take any action, but you 
did take a strong stance about doing &quot;nothing,&quot; (which might be considered an act of 
&#x27;inaction&#x27; if you think about it) and now you&#x27;re somewhere on the middle ground ... do 
something, but don&#x27;t do it on eBay.  All, reasonable positions to take, I might add.  

I understand what you are saying about not wanting to generate negative energy.  I guess 
at this point we are talking about the motivating emotion behind a chosen action as the 
determining factor as to whether or not the same action would be construed as positive or 
negative (or stone throwing, as you call it). 

With ANY of the choices in this matter, there is a corresponding consequence, or 
consequences.  Over the last couple days, a number of options have been thrown out 
there.  The problem is, the situation is complicated, and I don&#x27;t think there is any one 
correct, or even &#x27;best&#x27; solution, because any choice made carries with it some 
responsibility and ownership on the part of the decision maker, including the choice of 
inaction.

In a group a large as this it would likely be impossible to come to a consensus of a &quot;best&quot; 
solution.  And should that monumental task be achieved, and a single best solution 
agreed upon, it would be highly unlikely that there would be a unified motivation behind 
people&#x27;s opinions as to WHY that solution is best.  

Perhaps the most positive thing that has come from all of this, thus far, is the potential for 
introspection this discussion has brought forth, such as you recognizing your desire to 
&quot;inflict punishment.&quot;  What a marvelous gift that insight is. :-)

So, here is what we&#x27;ve come up with so far and the progression of suggestions:

Sell hacked units on eBay at cost or at a small loss

Sell hacked units for profit, but undercut other sellers

Do nothing

Offer hack instructions on eBay for free

Offer hack instructions in more places, but exclude eBay 

Did I miss any?  (probably)

Wow!  Lots for people to think about.  Seems at this point, it is up to each individual 
person to search within, decide for themselves what action (or inaction) will be taken and 
why.

&gt; Margaret,
&gt;  
&gt; In my initial reply I voiced my disdain for low lives that take advantage of unwary people
&gt; but did not advocate any action by any researchers on this board.
&gt;  
&gt; My goal is not just pacifism for it&#x27;s own sake, believe me any of the old timers here can 
attest to my temper.
&gt; My concern is for the negative disruption in the energy flow of the communication.
&gt; I think that following the example of &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; will be very well received on 
the other side and therefore 
&gt; contribute to strengthening the bridge.
&gt;  
&gt; In the past couple of days I know Kristin has received messages about the seven and the 
circle, 
&gt; these are metaphors for peace, harmony and cooperation of energies within the 
communication.
&gt;  
&gt; It is not the first time we have received messages with these examples, I personally have 
received numerous 
&gt; messages pertaining to circle, circles and the power of seven. It has been contemplated 
in length here more than once.
&gt;  
&gt; I have, through interpretation of communication over a long period of time, come to 
PERSONALLY believe that the urgence of 
&gt; harmony and positive energy is the fertilizer of the growth of our communication with 
the spirit world.
&gt;  
&gt; I&#x27;m sorry, I drifted off the subject at hand, but my reason is relevant to this commentary. 
&gt; Taking any action against this ebay fool will first and foremost serve our ego&#x27;s and 
secondly
&gt; may help to provide information to unwary buyers that is contrary to what this thief is 
putting out.
&gt;  
&gt; But could that not be accomplished through other venues that would help to educate 
many more people that
&gt; are would be box researchers and do not look to ebay as a source for an RS hack. But 
are seeking general knowledge.
&gt;  
&gt; And Margaret to thine own self be true, when this was brought up my first reaction was 
to figure out a way to sabotage
&gt; this guy&#x27;s business venture. After thinking it over and asking myself what the first 
reason for doing that would be. My answer
&gt; Was, to get this asshole that is exploiting something that I hold very dear, and in turn 
help to steer unaware buyers away from getting screwed.
&gt;  
&gt; But still my initial and primal reason was to inflict some sort of punishment on a person 
that I felt was unscrupulous. And I decided that this was
&gt; a negative emotion and would generate negative energy, no matter how I tried to 
convince myself it was in the name of justice.
&gt;  
&gt; That goes without even mentioning the fact that we are not the say all and do all of this 
research. There are other entities involved that I would think 
&gt; have better influential power than we do. If they want it stopped they will find a way to 
stop it. I know what your going to say, maybe we are the 
&gt; tools they are using to stop this injustice. That may very well be, and if so then that is 
the way it will play out.
&gt;  
&gt; I think you mistake what I am implying. I am not saying do nothing, quite the opposite. 
It is actually our duty to do something. All I&#x27;m saying is there 
&gt; are alternative ways to educate unwary possible researchers that would be 100% positive 
and not entail any type of stone throwing tactics.
&gt;  
&gt; I have said my piece now at the expense of boring everyone to death. So I will see how 
this unfolds, and during my daily session will inquire about how our friends feel about it.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Bruce. I don&#x27;t see this so much as an assault on anyone, as it is simply bringing 
awareness into a forum (ebay) where it is desperately needed. Was it not you who recently 
stated sellers who take advantage of others in this way are &quot;no more than thieves without 
guns&quot; and &quot;should not be patronized no matter the circumstances.&quot; You have 
characterized them as &quot;wolves&quot; and &quot;demons&quot; but now are saying &quot;do nothing.&quot; Which, 
honestly, I could understand if my suggestion was coming from a place of vengeance. It is 
not.THIS IS ABOUT EDUCATION FIRST AND FOREMOST, and standing up for those who are, 
unknowingly, being taken advantage of. The byproduct of providing this education will be 
allowing consumers to make an informed decision and if that hurts the sales of 
unscrupulous sellers, then so be it. Ann has just echoed some of my remarks in earlier 
posts in support of sellers rights to take advantage of the market ... that some people may 
find it&#x27;s worth it to pay more to someone to receive a previously hacked unit. I would 
venture to guess, this educational information will A) help prevent those who are capable 
of doing the hack themselves from being duped, and B) force sellers who do offer pre-
hacked units to do so for a more &#x27;reasonable&#x27; fee. This is neither spiteful nor aggressive, 
and it&#x27;s certainly not any kind of vengeance driven on my part. It&#x27;s standing up for the 
uninformed, leveling the playing field for sellers, and it&#x27;s bringing more people the 
knowledge that doing &#x27;box&#x27; research is not an exclusive club that only the rich can take 
part in (and given the pricing on the bids for these units, people are under the false 
assumption that you have a pay a high price to get your hands on a limited resource, 
when that simply is not the case.)I can see nothing but positive benefits coming from 
educating people about their options.Margaret--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com,

the back and forth posts about ideas on how to &gt; deal with the individual selling the 
hacks on ebay for inflated &gt; prices.&gt; &gt; I posted my thoughts on that individual yesterday. 
I would now like &gt; to render my opinion as to the subject of what we or anyone can do &gt; 
about it.&gt; &gt; My suggestion is DO NOTHING! Now before everybody&#x27;s jaw hits the &gt; floor, 
hear me out.&gt; &gt; A couple of months ago I would have been the one to lead the charge &gt; 
in the assault on this guy in the name of box justice.&gt; &gt; I can now say with confidence, 
That is not the way to handle it.&gt; Let me explain why I believe this way. Without going into 
a lot of &gt; detail, I was a tough street kid that grew up on the streets of &gt; Brooklyn, I also 
served my country proudly for six years as a us army &gt; green beret, then to a career as a 
FDNY Fireman whose heart and &gt; health where both broken at 911.&gt; &gt; My point is, I have 
always lived my life believing that anything I &gt; did not agree with or that did not fit my 
sense of right and wrong&gt; whether it be right or wrong, could be easily solved with 
aggression &gt; of some kind.&gt; &gt; It took a long while and much sole searching and a lot of 
&gt; communication interpretation from our friends on the other side.&gt; But I have come to 
learn that aggressive action in any form is &gt; detrimental to the harmony and peace of the 
whole involved.&gt; &gt; Guy&#x27;s like this guy on ebay do not and can not last in the face of &gt; 
good and well intentioned people that are here and willing and trying &gt; to get the word of 
this miraculous research and spirit communication &gt; out to as many people as are in need 
or want of it.&gt; &gt; That is how we can stop people like this bottom feeder. By spreading &gt; 
the knowledge of this research from one person to the next. Our &gt; friends have stated 
time and time again that any negative energy will &gt; be detrimental to the communication 
and the research, and positive &gt; harmony and vibration will serve to strengthen the bridge 
between our &gt; worlds.&gt; &gt; So even if you are not religious and do not believe in Jesus 
Christ &gt; as I do, these words ring true no matter what context they come from&gt; this 
wisdom was spoken by my lord two thousand years ago.&gt; &gt; &quot;do not check the splinter in 
your brothers eye, until you have &gt; checked the plank in your own&quot;&gt; &gt; Truthfully, 
anything we could do to sway this individuals sale of &gt; these boxes would be minimal. 
Negativity and greed always find a &gt; crack to seep through.&gt; &gt; My suggestion is lets try a 
little harder to spread the word of the &gt; research and educate individuals that are or may 
become interested, &gt; through all the various outlets available to us on the web concerning 
&gt; the paranormal research community. There are endless chat boards, &gt; groups and 
forums plus websites and word of mouth. &gt; Instead of trying to stop this idiot from 
defrauding innocent &gt; unknowledgable people. Lets make sure the knowledge is out there 
for &gt; them and we are here to help them and guy&#x27;s like Mr. ebay will &gt; disappear on their 
own.&gt; &gt; And we will not have expended an ounce of negative energy in the &gt; process.&gt; 
That&#x27;s how I feel, but that&#x27;s just me.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt;
