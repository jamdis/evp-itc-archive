<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Those of you who have listened to Coast to Coast AM for many years will 
know who Art Bell is. He was one of the first to openly talk on the 
radio about the kind of stuff we ITC researchers enjoy so much.
Some sad news was announced on the show last night.

Art Bell&#x27;s mother passed away - Jane Lee Bell
It was announced on Coast to Coast AM last night that Art Bell&#x27;s mother 
had died on 23 December 2008.
Condolences to Art Bell and his family. Mrs. Bell was seen by those 
attending and watching the induction of Art Bell into the Radio Hall of 
Fame, last month. She congratulated her son in a video taped message.
