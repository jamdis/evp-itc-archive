This is at work\n(don&#39;t tell the boss!). \n&gt;  \n&gt; The one about the male dog might refer to the mate to this female \npoodle we have now. For those unfamilar, our daughter in-law knows \nsomeone that rescues dogs, and she was tryuing to get rid of some of \nher too many animals. The daughter in-law at first gave us the male \npoodle a few weeks ago, but he was deaf, blind, and someone, \nprobably the puppy mill he came from, pulled all his teeth. He was \ntoo much to deal with, he fell down our stairs twice, and we felt he \nwas suffereing too much, so we took him to the Dumb Friends League. \nNow we have his mate, but she has most of her teeth, and can hear, \nsee and is a little sweetie. #4 is hopefully accurate. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Help yourself to FREE treats served up daily at the Messenger \nCaf.
