Ok I finally finished listening to the radio show and just wanted to say you guys did a great job of representing the work being done in this field. It was great to hear your voices and George's amazement that Franks Box works so well. Cant wait to hear George Noory and Richard Hoagland tuning in to thier own boxes (if they are ableto do so).
   
  Great job guys!
