<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Clara.  You might start with exploring the manual sweep method.  As Charm 
mentioned, just about any radio will do.  Here&#x27;s some instructions I&#x27;ve previously written 
out.  Keep in mind that researchers each have the own &quot;style&quot; and preferences, so what I&#x27;m 
sharing is my way of going about things, but certainly should not be considered the 
&#x27;only/best/right&#x27; way... it&#x27;s just ONE way.  ;-)  I&#x27;ll just copy/paste them here:

     Turn on your radio to AM or FM, depending on your reception. Some areas don&#x27;t receive 
AM very well.  I&#x27;ve had good results using either band.  Start your recorder.  I record into 
my computer using Audacity (it&#x27;s a free download) and the built-in mic. Quickly move the 
dial from one end to another so only fragments of each channel currently broadcasting are 
heard coming through the speaker(s). Be mindful of the volume.  You want it to be not too 
loud nor too soft. 

     I&#x27;ve noticed this technique works best with radios which allow for quickly moving 
through the channels. My favorite handheld radio is the Duracell KP028.  The dial is small 
and easily moves  through all the stations. I think that&#x27;s key, that there not be long gaps 
between the stations or that it takes so long to move from station to station that multiple 
words can be heard from each broadcast (some more expensive stereo units seem to be 
like this). Also, it seems to not work well when there is a lot of static between stations.  So 
if need be, switch from AM to FM. 

     While you are moving the dial back and forth, talk as you would if you were having a 
conversation with someone in the room with you, only speak a little more slowly.  Wait a 
short time between each question or comment. Somewhere between 10-15 seconds 
seems to be good, but you could wait as long as 30 seconds. 

     When reviewing the session, you&#x27;ll want to listen for a voice that stands out from the 
rest of the radio sweep, and also for the words/phrases to be relevant. Sometimes the 
voice will be choppy, as if formed from the snippets of broadcasts. [Opportunistic EVP]  
Other times, the voice will float above the sweep sound. [or even take over the sweep 
sound completely -Transform EVP]  Listen first to an entire segment, starting with your 
voice and ending just before you speak again.  Then go back and listen to that segment a 
few seconds at a time.  Less clear responses can easily be missed during the first pass.
 
     I have a tendency to discard almost all single words because they could have been from 
an actual broadcast, but when I hear a phrase that is longer, I know it could not have come 
from a single broadcasting station because I&#x27;m sweeping the channels too quickly for 
more than one syllable to be picked up by the microphone.  

Please, have patience if you try this.  Even if you are an experienced researcher, it takes 
practice to learn to hear the responses, just as it does to become accustomed to listening 
for and hearing EVP.  

----- I hope this helps some.  After a while, you will probably notice you are able to hear 
more responses &quot;real-time&quot; because your ears will become more attuned to any method 
that you work with a lot.

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I am Clara and I live in Central California. I have been a paranormal
&gt; investigator since 2006 and I have been very fortunate to record many
&gt; messages with digital and analog voice recorders.
&gt; 
&gt; Within my investigative groups, I have always been the EVP tech. I
&gt; have discovered that there are many more angles to EVP than just
&gt; straight recording.
&gt; 
&gt; I joined your group to learn more and boy I have been so fascinated
&gt; with all the talk among you all with your equipment.
&gt; 
&gt; How should I start? Who can give me some good advice on what I should
&gt; try next? I am not gifted to be able to build things, maybe unless
&gt; they are very easy.
&gt; 
&gt; I would travel (with time to plan it) if I was able to learn more
&gt; about other methods for capturing evp.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for your time to read my message and hopefully you can help me.
