There&#39;s menu on the left side that \nshould have it listed. \n\n Those RS radios are prabably the most economical way to start \nexperimenting with that method. \n\n Frank-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;msm00&quot; &lt;fvshkatie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m Katie, the founder of Fox Valley Spirit Hunters in Oshkosh WI.  \nI \n&gt; have developed a lot of interest in the audio/video aspect of \n&gt; investigating and was pleased to find this group.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a request.  I have been reading up on Frank&#39;s box and the RS \n&gt; hack and have been curious to experiment with a gadget of this \nsort. \n&gt; However, I haven&#39;t gone ahead until now, since I just unexpectedly \n&gt; found an older model 12-470 in our local RS store and snapped it \nup. \n&gt; \n&gt; What I need are written instructions (versus the video) for the \n&gt; modifications needed.  Unfortunately, hubby and I live in the stix \nand \n&gt; do not yet have high speed access. THe videos look wonderful but \nsimply \n&gt; take far too long to download on dialup for us.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is someone out there in possession of written instructions and \nwould \n&gt; they be willing to share them?  I would really appreciate it.  Thx!\n&gt;"}
