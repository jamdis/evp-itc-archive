<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I saw a very good test done once on tv and it was shocking to me.  The person had 2 cameras at a location, a 35mm and a digital.

They took several pictures at the same time side by side, the digital had several &quot;Orbs&quot; and the 35mm caught no anomaly&#x27;s at all in any of the pictures.

I believe what could be called an &quot;Orb&quot; for the most part can be debunked quickly as dust, rain, bugs....etc

At least 99 percent anyway.  I think we have more luck in the field using different types of audio for evidence.

Just my thoughts

&gt; One photo has multiple &quot;orbs&quot; - this indicates it is most likely dust particle reflections. The other one, probably dust, too. Did you take multiple photos from the exact same spot to compare?
