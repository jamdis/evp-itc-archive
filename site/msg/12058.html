Yes definitely they are helping. They often will suggest settings for software or filters or methods to use to record or even times when they will be more active. I just dont always understand what they mean until it smacks me in the face later LOL I am not a technical type person so I find myself using google alot to look words/subjects up that make no sense to me. Even then I am just feeling my way around in the dark when it comes to the how or the why. I dont ask how or why anymore I just focus more on the &quot;who/what&quot;. No matter the method I get the same group of talkers (+/- the strangers who pop in to say hello).

&gt; Hi Misty,
&gt; Thank YOU for the simple, concise explanation. It appears
&gt; that whoever or whatever is &quot;controlling&quot; the
&gt; sessions on the other side, they seem to be helping organize
&gt; the best method of recording by each individual who is
&gt; recording. It almost seems as if there were some sort of
&gt; organized effort to help, doesn&#x27;t it? :)

&gt; Franks box sweeps the band either linear or random and
&gt; grabs snippets of stations and for me is much louder
&gt; fragments of speech that I often hear live as I record. With
&gt; this its just on no station, recording what sounds like
&gt; nothing or the occasional buzz whoosh that comes thru. Frank
&gt; will have to be the one to explain the difference in detail
&gt; he knows alot more about the subject when it comes to how
&gt; his box functions.
&gt; 
&gt; I know some have had loud conversations using DRV I think
&gt; theres even a youtube video of someone doing that. But I did
&gt; not hear them like a broadcast the way they did, I didnt
&gt; hear them at all until I played it back and was surprised to
&gt; hear our names and speaking directly to me or my friend. Its
&gt; interesting. It would be nice to get to that level of
&gt; clarity that some claim to have had. I do believe the
&gt; possibility exists to expand in many areas and this will
&gt; just be one more I will be adding to my agenda.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; I was wondering what the difference between the DRV
&gt; sessions
&gt; &gt; and a recording made through the &quot;Frank&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; Box&quot;, or any other box might be? 
&gt; &gt; Thank YOU!

&gt; &gt; I did a DRV session last night and I just wanted to
&gt; share
&gt; &gt; some of the 
&gt; &gt; results with the group. They came thru quite clearly
&gt; even
&gt; &gt; tho they had 
&gt; &gt; some difficulty making the link to where I was tuned
&gt; off
&gt; &gt; station in 
&gt; &gt; the &quot;dead&quot; zone. I usually start and end my
&gt; sweep
&gt; &gt; sessions off station 
&gt; &gt; but they had been coming thru quite clear there so
&gt; last
&gt; &gt; night I did the 
&gt; &gt; entire session that way. As always Tony was there to
&gt; lend a
&gt; &gt; hand.

&gt; try
&gt; &gt; downloading 
&gt; &gt; then playing.
