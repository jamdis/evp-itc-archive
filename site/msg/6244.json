I have orb photos from a \nlady right after her teenage son passed.  They were gray-ish and \nswirly, the gray color indicating (IMHO) that the light was only \nsomewhat covered over by some darkness.  You can see the light and \nthe dark in them.  That to me is a ghost orb of a person who had not \nyet moved unto the light, but was held earthbound due to his funeral \nand grieving family.\n\nDarkness to me means &quot;lack of understanding - lost.&quot;  The condition \nof darkness could best be described as &quot;mis-thinking,&quot; thinking \ncontrary to truth.  I think the more a person &quot;mis-thinks,&quot; the more \nthe light is covered over.  The light is still there, but hidden, so \nto speak.  So, in that sense, it is possible for some orbs to be \nghosts and not just spirits, as I believe the boy&#39;s orb indicated.\n\nJust my opinion, after looking at these for years. ;)\n\nLC\nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;eastern_paranormal&quot; \n&lt;eparanormal@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I like the &quot;What are orbs one.&quot; Do you think he meant ghost or \nspirits \n&gt; as their is a difference.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gab\n&gt;"}
