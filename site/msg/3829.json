If you must know, yes I&#39;ve confronted darkness face to \nface. What some would call evil... calling my name. \n\nI was but a small child at the time, looking through crib slats. Long \nago but never forgotten. Something I now know was a war for my soul \ntook place, as much as that is odd to relate. Pleasing terror yawned \nwide, like sharp toothed jaws on one side, yet a light of infinite \npower and truth, a lighthouse within, finally sent her away, along \nwith a simple decision I made, to embrace the highest and best.\n\nThat&#39;s about as much as I wish to say, since many will not understand \nlet alone believe, until such a thing is revealed to them, as it was \nto me. It is so difficult to put such forces from within and beyond \ninto words, and even harder to understand.   \n\nLOL!\n\nSuffice it to say I am a believer.\n\nMy quest in this life is to play a small part, a singular role, like \na tiny ripple in the vast sea.\n\nNothing more. Nothing less.  \n\nLance\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@...m, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; But again, Lance, I am talking about personal experiences, not \nother  \n&gt; people&#39;s alleged experiences.

I personally don&#39;t like to \nfocus\n&gt; &gt; on evil entities, even though I believe 100% that lower astrals\n&gt; &gt; exist. Not only that, Tibetan shamans, among others, have \nrepeatedly\n&gt; &gt; shown that thought forms can be given form and a measure of life.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The way I see it, if we keep a higher focus, such things as rage,\n&gt; &gt; hate, and destruction among other things will be far removed. \nOuija\n&gt; &gt; Boards have many times been the source of horrible experiences. \nJust\n&gt; &gt; from listening to all the hundreds of callers on C2C over the \nyears,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d say over 95% of the stories weren&#39;t good.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; George did make a good statement to the effect that it&#39;s not good\n&gt; &gt; giving a loaded gun to a child.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lance\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, lisby@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He may very well have changed it.
