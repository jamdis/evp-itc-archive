<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Aluminum seems to work the best. I got a voice that sounded like Raudive
saying copper. I have used plastic and wood. Different materials seem to
allow different levels, but it&#x27;s hard to tell for sure who/what is talking.

 Folding the tube seems to make it act like a larger tube. With just a long
straight tube the sound tends to be tinny. I made a chamber 12 inches square
and 4 feet long from MDF board lined with aluminum foil years ago, the
voices were almost demonic sounding, so I took it apart.

 The only difference with the hacked radio is the sweep. With the hack radio
the sweep steps so the radio is tuned in 10khz increments. With the box it&#x27;s
a continuous sweep, linear uses a triangle wave.

&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s just a chamber, an enclosure, anything can be used depending on how
&gt; &gt; much room you have. The effect is like a mechanical sound filter. The
&gt; larger
&gt; &gt; the siaze the lower tyhe effected frequencies. I use tubing so it can be
&gt; &gt; made smaller to fit inside a cabinet. I don&#x27;t even measure anything when
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; make an echo chamber, it&#x27;s just made to fit whatever cabinet I&#x27;m using.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The boxes work without the chamber, but the chamber seems to add
&gt; something,
&gt; &gt; maybe a space where the sound can be more easily manipulated.
