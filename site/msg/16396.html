  What humans don't get =
is there is more than their punny little intellects/egos here, When "nothin=
g happens" it'll be because we were successful! That is not we as in human!=

 
 Just like Y2K, if no one had taken it seriously, and done no corrective=
 programming, who knows how bad it may have been. 
 
 Don't forget, the May=
ans, and every other culture that has these predictions plotted the orbits =
of the planets and stars, and knew the position of the earth inside the dam=
n galaxy without any freaking computers. There ain't one of you brainiacs a=
live that could do that, yet you'll break out pompus and all knowing!
