Greetings All,  My name is Ken & I've been reading the group for a few days=
 now.
I have some observations & a couple of ideas I'd like to share:

It a=
mazes me how like minded intentions attract the same.
Like Rick Moran, Fran=
k, & Ron.  I too am a licensed Ham Radio Operator and 
am very interested i=
n EVP,etc.  I'm also a Remote Viewer, Sensitive, & dowser.
My studies have =
taught me that these things basically work on the same principles.
In Physi=
cs there's something called Quantum entanglement.  In a nutshell, Its the 
=
idea of all things being familiar & related due to their physical make up. =
 Like identical 
twins separated at birth, all things are connected and awa=
re of one another, even though
miles apart & separated for years.  Also, ju=
st as time & space exists in a vacuum, all
things live forever.  Once a wor=
d is spoken or an attitude is acted out its effects can be 
witnessed forev=
er, (Like dropping a pebble in water & watching the ripples).  When I was 
=
teen I overdosed on some chemically treated weed.  I had an OBE & saw the t=
unnel of 
white light thing, had the whole experience.  Ever since then I'v=
e understood that we are 
multidimensional, nothing dies, it only evolves o=
r changes energy forms.

People will always shy away from & fear that which=
 they don't understand.  
They try to label things as evil, good, right, & =
wrong.  Things are relative.
Your intentions are what makes things what the=
y are.  You will always find
what you look for.  Keep up the good work, its=
 all very interesting.
