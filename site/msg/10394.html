Thank you, but I'm thinking because his wife crossed over before him.  Then maybe I might have a good chance of contact!  You never can tell.

adjustment period after crossing over. The general recommendation is
that you don't try to contact them immediately (funny - I am listening
to a paranormal radio show and they just said the same thing as I was
typing that) as they have a lot to get used to and need to concentrate
on that. I figure at worst, if they aren't ready to be in contact
again yet, they will be shielded from it and you just won't get
anything. However, I know of cases where they were able to be back in
contact within a few days, and sometimes as litte as 24 hours.
Usually, the less traumatic the passing, the quicker they are able to
be back in contact. If they had led a full life and aren't afraid of
dying, it's easier, too.

The other consideration with the ITC is that it may take him awhile to
get the hang of manipulating whatever it is they manipulate to
communicate with us. I don't imagine that that is high up on the
checklist of things to do once you die.

My condolences to you and your family

Nellie
