This experiment is for those who want to try different methods, and see wha=
t works.
I thought you'd agree with that, since you say so on the home page=
 here.

There is of course more than one possible outcome: 1 or more people=
 can get the right result, and 1 or more people get an incorrect result.=C2=
=A0 The goal would be to continue experiments, and allow those people to co=
ntinue to try different methods, and different opinions on what works and w=
hat doesn't=C2=A0 (like yours), and see what works.

If you're not really i=
nteresting in trying different methods and seeing what works, feel free to =
ignore our efforts.

It is quite possible that someone co=

This would negate the =

=C2=A0
If the audio file were quite clear, tim=

=C2=A0
The important detail however is that this ex=
periment does not completely answer the 
question. It is a first attempt an=
d certainly can be improved on successive trials.
=C2=A0
Successive trials =
are always a good idea, since it provides replication. And it would be

 if others replicated the experiment using a very similar protocol. If thes=

succeed, the community could then state that out of X trials Y ha=

by random chance. This would make the outcome=
 quantifiable and measureable 
and thus meaningful.
=C2=A0
But also importa=

I=
