I figure that if this \nperson is going to sell them and people are going to pay these prices, \nthen that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen.  That market isn&#39;t going to go on \nforever, and sooner or later people are not going to pay that much, if \nanything, for his product if they figure out it can be done more cheaply. \nLet supply and demand meet until demand diminishes. So I agree with the \n&quot;Do Nothing.&quot;\n\n(Note it&#39;s not me selling them - I only have one eBay logon and it&#39;s w9sz, \nsame as my ham radio callsign.)\n\nZack"}
