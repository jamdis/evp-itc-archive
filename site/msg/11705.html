Chad,
Just make sure you go into that investigation with a clear mind.
If a=
nything happens and you don't feel comfortable then you step
outside.
Email=
 me, and I can help you with a few pointers.
Deb

I am sched=
uled to do an investigation on Saturday. Let me say, I have
very little exp=
erience with investigating, and have really only
started very recently. I a=
m going with an experienced group to
investigate a residence described as v=
ery active. Lots of class A
EVPs, supposed incubus/succubus activities, des=
cribed as an
infestation. What are your thoughts on known demonic entity
in=
vestigations?
