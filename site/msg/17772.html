<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Sorry I haven&#x27;t been involved for the last week or so.  I have been up to my eyeballs in the paranormal lately and I needed a break. I am going through the posts now and I see it was a lively week.

As for these clips Frank, the first one is exceptional.  I hear it slightly different from you.  To me it sounds like: &quot;Here is Edison everyone.&quot;

Could he be announcing himself to the group who was using the box?  Or was someone introducing him?

Good stuff.

Tim
