Chris Moon really rates well below my theory for humanity! I was invited once to write for his mag. I sent them an email asking how they wanted the copy to be submitted. Either by email or file.
Three years later, I am STILL waiting for the reply to my request!! 
But, I do agree with you however. It is to bad that Frank didn't have everyone who bought a box to sign a waiver that would prevent the box from being potentially abused by them. 
I wonder, how often is it that Moon actually books a paid session? I know that Moon has been going to different Universities. Most college kids today don't have that kind of money laying around!

I am concerend because Chris Moon is using Frank's box under his name to make money. He 
charges $250 for a half hour session with this box. I wouldn't be so irritated had he just 
called it something else, but this is Frank's and it should be up to Frank how this box is used. 
I think using it to make money is wrong. I am not saying it would be wrong for Frank to 
market it it, at a reasonable price, but to charge $250 for a session that is under the 
interpretation of Chris Moon is just playing on those who are suffering from a loss and 
looking for a connection.
