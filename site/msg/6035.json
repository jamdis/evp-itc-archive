You may look at me\n&gt; as a stirrer of whatever you want to say I&#39;m stirring. If it causes\n&gt; one of you to consider the validity of the research then that is\n&gt; great. One of you were very surprised to discover that time is being\n&gt; removed from posted files. One of you freaked out when I suggested\n&gt; that raw files should be whats posted. One offered to post both. One\n&gt; said no way! One of you has files incredibly clearer than anyone \nelse.\n&gt; One of you is beginning to look a little less on the up and up. Two\n&gt; have emailed me their own concerns for the integrity in research. \nCall\n&gt; me what you will but, if integrity is what has you riled up, if a\n&gt; desire for raw true files to be posted causes an issue then so be \nit.\n&gt; Maybe your smelling the shit I stirred and maybe thats because you\n&gt; just might be standing in it. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday\n&gt; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ann,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t apologise and don&#39;t be sucked in!\n&gt; &gt; she&#39;s a spy and a crap stirrer, the less she is here the better.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She has no concern for the research or how it is conducted.

I think I hear a track silenced, too.\n&gt; If so, why did you do that?&quot; Then I get to answer and explain why I\n&gt; did it that way, offer the raw clip, or whatever. It doesn&#39;t come \noff\n&gt; as a broad attack--just a friendly question. Even Bruce wouldn&#39;t rip\n&gt; out your living eyeballs for that. (Well... maybe he wouldn&#39;t, \nanyway.\n&gt; ;) ) \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I agree with your search for The Truth. I really do. That&#39;s why \nyou\n&gt; see me get all rough-and-tumble over stuff like the Luminator when I\n&gt; think it is it lacking convincing evidence. But it&#39;s waaaaaay too\n&gt; early in &quot;boxology&quot; to try to make it perform as a pet circus \nanimal.\n&gt; Hell, we&#39;ve been studying traditional EVP for 30 years and it still\n&gt; won&#39;t perform on cue for the scientists or anyone else. But if you\n&gt; just listen to what you get on your own and what all the others are\n&gt; getting, it becomes very clear indeed that a real phenomenon is\n&gt; occurring. Sure, some things we get that we think are paranormal may\n&gt; be just radio fragments, but one radio fragment does not negate all\n&gt; box communication. One tweaked clip is not indicative of a culture \nof\n&gt; researcher deceit. One &quot;I am Bazoozoo! Time to fry, foolish mortal!&quot;\n&gt; does not mean that the RS hacks are pathways to Satan&#39;s indoor\n&gt; plumbing. There are no easy answers yet--and there may never be any.\n&gt; And I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re at the stage yet where we have the right to\n&gt; demand The Truth or whether we would even see it if it was staring \nus\n&gt; in the face.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; All right, enough joy in myself one-hand clapping.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; LC is right that if you want to try to pursue this in the way you\n&gt; want to pursue it, then you need to find some people who share your\n&gt; mindset and go to it. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to find those \npeople\n&gt; here, necessarily--at least among the old guard. We&#39;re the beatniks \nin\n&gt; black leather, smoking ciggies and reading bad poetry to the beat of\n&gt; bongos, HMO.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Jan 21, 2008, at 1:37 PM, babiarz3 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just to clear things up.. the file I&#39;m referring to is not from\n&gt; anyoneinvolved in this group so when I say that occasionally I hear\n&gt; theirvoices become shaky, that is not a comment on anyone here.\n&gt; Also,please don&#39;t misread what I actually said.

Too many\n&gt; layers,too fast, etc. I have the luxury now of sitting and analyzing\n&gt; the filein my own time. As for fear being a factor... I do believe\n&gt; that the attitude of theinvestigators present during a session does\n&gt; effect the outcome. EvenBruce who would rather cut my eyeballs out\n&gt; with a razor has said thesame. If you think that I am scared, fine. \nIf\n&gt; I&#39;m missing one thing itis probably a healthy dose of fear. Don&#39;t \nmake\n&gt; the mistake of missingthe points by name calling.
