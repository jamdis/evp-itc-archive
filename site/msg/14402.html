Wish I knew how to "enhance" the correct way,  because they sure have a lot 
to say over there, and I all ready had my mom come  through loud and clear 
last night again, even a little boy and dad maybe from  this neighborhood 
talked directly to me, although for me it sounded like they  were in a tin 
can.   There is plenty of other stuff coming through as  well, what do I care 
if people don't believe this, I do because, I know this is  meant to be, and 
I am sure of it it's going to be something for other's  like seeing is 
believing and there is nothing we can do for them, it's like the  Wright 
Brother's flying for the first time here people, they said how in the  world will 
that big heavy thing get off the ground?  I say lets go for it,  a machine 
will be found to make them come in loud and clear one  day.  sf

Now I may be biased to the "investigation" way of doing things.  I do  
clean up evps if I hear something and can't make it out do to ambient  noise.  
So hear is my question.  When do you stop cleaning up?   Wouldn't to much 
enhancing "taint" the results?  To me the more enhancing  you do the less 
convincing it becomes.  I hope no one finds this  offensive, it is not meant to 
be I am just really curious.  The way I  look at it is that if you have to do 
so much enhancing to find anything, was  there really something there to 
begin with.  Are we just making ourselves  believe there is something there??
