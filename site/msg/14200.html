Hi April,

I have been out today, first day my poison ivy would let me back out of the house.  I made good on my escape, LOL.  If everyone will bear with me I think I recall the files, involved.  This happened just a little over a year ago, and I think I still have the files.  When I find them I will let you know the file types and the destination and origin of the files.  I had a computer crash since that time and I will have to back to backup files to extract and restore the files. I think that I got a copy of the file that our member had that was a total loss as a copy, with the data loss.  The data loss was great enough that the file did not come close to the original.  I got in my car and drove over to my team members home to listen to the file I ad sent him by e-mail through Yahoo I believe. I 'll verify that too.

I will try to get you guys the information on the files by tomorrow night.  I hope everyone had a great weekend.

 
Regards,
Jon in Texas

I have not personally experienced the loss 
myself. Jon from this list is the one who originally told me about it. I 
have also heard of it happening to a few other people. After my 
conversation with Jon, I talked to a computer professional, and he told me 
that you can experience loss in attached files.
 
I don't know if you would be able to tell 
loss of quality in an audio file with a bit-level comparison. Just because the 
data has been replaced, doesn't have to mean it is perfect.
 
Did you listen to the before and after 
results?
 
Jon-Please relay your experience with the 
loss of quality on emailed files.

I can't vouch for your computer or servers, but I just  did some tests, and sent a 2.1MB wav file from MSN to Yahoo and back,  once allowing compression, and once turning it off.   I was  able to verify that one was compressed and one was not, by checking the  sizes when they arrived at Yahoo. Once they came back to MSN, I then did  a bit-level comparison of the original, and the ones sent around  email.  They were all identical, which indicates lossless  compression.

If you have a file you'd like me to test for you,  let me know.  But I wouldn't take someone's word for how your  server's work, without testing them yourself.

For executables, you may be right.  However, for wav files, the compression during email is not loss less. 
 
I used to think as you do, in that  the emailed attachment of a wav file would not loose anything.  After a lengthy discourse with another member here, I learned that I  was wrong. The reason why I did not realize it in the first place  is that when I would email a wav file, I would intentionally keep it  in very small segments, to keep file size down. This was just for ease  of transfer. But because of this, I had not experienced any noticeable  loss.
 
Now it may be in some cases,  depending on the servers or what have you that the file goes through,  that the loss may be less or more. But once the attachment is  downloaded, the quality has been found to be less then  the original wav.
 
Again though you can only really  tell when the wav file is large.

The kind of compression that occurs during an  email attachment is "lossless": it compress the file cleverly  without losing information.  For example, if I had a  program in some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it could  compress it.  But if it lost even one bit, the resulting  exe file would not execute again after it was uncompressed on  the other side.

This kind of compression does things  like looking for common patterns in the file, and replacing  them with a token.  A rough example would be if it found  "Howdy Neighbor" in a file 20 times, it could replace all the  occurances with say $HN1.  And also write a little  dictionary in there someplace that says "$HN1=Howdy  Neighbor".

When the file gets to its destination it can  be uncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are replaced with  "Howdy Neighbor".  So it was compressed (instead of 14  characters each, it only needed 4, plus the dictionary), but  lost no data.

Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not  lossless.  Depending on the level of compression, some  level of data is lost, and so cannot be recovered or  reconstructed later.

Another  thing:
 
I recently found this  out. When you email a file, if it is not saved as a  compressed format, the email filtering process will actually  compress the file automatically.
 
So even if you have  attached a wav. file, it will loose resolution over the  email process. It will not sound exactly the same as the  original wav. file. How much it differs depends on the size  of the file you are attaching. If it is a very large  file, it will sound much different.
 
The only exception to  this is if the wav. file is small enough that the filtering  process will ignore it. It has to be pretty small though,  like under 1 MB (I am not exactly sure of the  threshold).
 
The best way to share  files over the internet if you want them as close to  the original as possible is to upload them directly to a  website.

Pixelization doesn't clean-up the  data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking a picture  of a field of flowers, and beginning to add levels  or pixelization to the picture.  Soon, you  would not be able to tell there were flowers there  at all.  You would see a lot of colored  blocks.

Or in the other direction, imagine  you are looking at a competely randomize bunch of  pixes on your screen: a complete screen of truely  random static snow.  Pixelizing this, after a  while, you would again start to see colored  blocks.

What's happening is that it is  processing an area of the image, taking (for  instance) the average value of that entire area, and  replacing all the blocks in that area with the  average.  In video processing, this would  result in a field of multi-colored flowers being  replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish  block, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the  noise example, it maybe replace all the random  pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.   If you did not know beforehand what the original  picture was, you couldn't tell whether your  pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a  chevy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of  pixels.

It works the same with the sound  files.  Taking something as complex as speech,  and replacing frequencies with their averages, loses  the speech the farther you go, until you head  strange fluctuating square waves.  Doing the  same to random static will eventually produce the  same thing.  And random fluctuating square  waves can sound a bit like speech - or at least, you  could have fun sharing with each other what you  thing they 'sound like'.

I always save the whole file in wav format  then do my clips as mp3. Then I have the  original for analysis. 
 
As far as pixelization of non sounds/white  noise whos to say that isnt being manipulated by  them as well LOL. Water is a form of white  noise. I seem to remember some experiments done  with blank tapes/film, no recording done  yet there were voices/images there. I find it  all interesting.
 
Just a thought. Ok off to work now!

Be a bit careful of formats like  mp3 if you are doing a detailed analysis of the  sounds though.   While some formats  (like wav) can store the audio very close to the  way it was recorded, formats like mp3 compress  the file, and in so doing lose some of the sonic  details.  This may not be a big deal in  music, where the audio is fairly clear to begin  with.  But with sound sources with a lot of  noise (like evps), this can not only obscure any  real sounds, but pixelize non-sounds (like white  noise) and make them start to sound like  speech.

So mp3 might be good for sharing  the data, once you've already formed an opinion  based on an analysis of the wav file.  But  mp3 is not good as a medium for analysis.   It can lead to many false positives and  misinterpretations.

 You will get the hang of it. Kristen  is right thats how you save it. For most  softwares its under save as or export as. If you  still have trouble use one of the links I posted  to help ya out.

                          <td valign="top"><br>Pixelization doesn't clean-up the 
                            data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking a picture 
                            of a field of flowers, and beginning to add levels 
                            or pixelization to the picture.  Soon, you 
                            would not be able to tell there were flowers there 
                            at all.  You would see a lot of colored 
                            blocks.<br><br>Or in the other direction, imagine 
                            you are looking at a competely randomize bunch of 
                            pixes on your screen: a complete screen of truely 
                            random static snow.  Pixelizing this, after a 
                            while, you would again start to see colored 
                            blocks.<br><br>What's happening is that it is 
                            processing an area of the image, taking (for 
                            instance) the average value of that entire area, and 
                            replacing all the blocks in that area with the 
                            average.  In video processing, this would 
                            result in a field of multi-colored flowers being 
                            replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish 
                            block, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the 
                            noise example, it maybe replace all the random 
                            pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.  
                            If you did not know beforehand what the original 
                            picture was, you couldn't tell whether your 
                            pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a 
                            chevy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of 
                            pixels.<br><br>It works the same with the sound 
                            files.  Taking something as complex as speech, 
                            and replacing frequencies with their averages, loses 
                            the speech the farther you go, until you head 
                            strange fluctuating square waves.  Doing the 
                            same to random static will eventually produce the 
                            same thing.  And random fluctuating square 
                            waves can sound a bit like speech - or at least, you 
                            could have fun sharing with each other what you 
                            thing they 'sound like'.<br><br><br><br><br><br>---

                                mp3 if you are doing a detailed analysis of the 
                                sounds though.   While some formats 
                                (like wav) can store the audio very close to the 
                                way it was recorded, formats like mp3 compress 
                                the file, and in so doing lose some of the sonic 
                                details.  This may not be a big deal in 
                                music, where the audio is fairly clear to begin 
                                with.  But with sound sources with a lot of 
                                noise (like evps), this can not only obscure any 
                                real sounds, but pixelize non-sounds (like white 
                                noise) and make them start to sound like 
                                speech.<br><br>So mp3 might be good for sharing 
                                the data, once you've already formed an opinion 
                                based on an analysis of the wav file.  But 
                                mp3 is not good as a medium for analysis.  
                                It can lead to many false positives and 
                                misinterpretations.<br><br>--- On <b>Sun,
