<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I used to use shortwave radios in the 70&#x27;s (my dad had a small
collection) to try to tune in other wordly beings. I guess today
people would refer to the entities I was trying to reach as ethereals.
I believed then as I do now the non-physical beings are all around us.
  The possibility sparked my imagination but I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what
I was doing, I even used to speak to my radio even though there was no
mic as I suspected I could connect psychically. -Bill

&gt; &gt; &gt;  Who&#x27;s the brainiac that put a link the group on C2C!? I might have 
&gt; &gt; to keep my group e-mail turned off, the temptation to do e-mail at 
&gt; work 
&gt; &gt; might be overwhelming! I need the job to pay for box junk!
