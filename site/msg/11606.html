&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m Becca, and I&#x27;m a new member to the group. I live in S. GA. I&#x27;m a
&gt; wife, mother of one, artist (photographer, and professional
&gt; soap-artisan). I&#x27;ve had a life long interest in the
&gt; supernatural/paranormal/occult. I&#x27;ve looked into joining a few local
&gt; paranormal groups which have sprung up this year, but thus far haven&#x27;t
&gt; entered membership level with either. Soooo, instead of just being
&gt; stagnant and doing nothing, I&#x27;m interested in putting together more
&gt; equipment/&quot;know-how&quot; from a techie standpoint of view for doing my own
&gt; investigations with family and close friends. (Pretty much all members
&gt; of my family are interested in this sort of phenomenon.) I have a very
&gt; techno-knowledgeable husband who could pretty much put together
&gt; whatever equipment we need. Of course, being that we&#x27;re pretty much a
&gt; one income family, the more we can build ourselves, lowering the cost,
&gt; the better. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; I have lots of side interests, background, etc. but that sorta covers
&gt; where I&#x27;m coming from.
&gt; 
&gt; And yes, I&#x27;m finding all this information (out &quot;there&quot;) so over
&gt; whelming!  Trying to figure out the right place to start. I do plan on
&gt; having my techie-hubby check out Frank&#x27;s schematics, because I do hear
&gt; over and over that his box is still &quot;da&#x27;bomb.&quot;  :D
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; 
&gt; Becca
