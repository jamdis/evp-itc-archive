I just got the chance to listen to it Frank!  The first part I didn't hear too clear, but the 'make a fuckin ding" that was CLEAR as a bell and you're right, that isn't something they would play on the radio.  The rest of it I could hear clear too, I just had a hard time hearing the very first part, but that one part was so  clear I was like wow wow!

 Same old story, get a voice that should be extra-ordinary, and not one friggin' comment. I was wondering over the weekend if I've spent enough time on this. The boxes produce little that anyone seems to hear, and if it's too clear, I'm sure some, or maybe many don't believe it. I guess it has to be that whispery s--- that you have to filter into oblivion to be a "true" EVP, and I think that's what most are listening for, it has to fit the paradigm of current ghost hunting knowledge, or it's rejected. I've reached a point where I'm tired of working on something that seems so pointless. What if what I hear think I hear is only my own mis-perceptions!?
