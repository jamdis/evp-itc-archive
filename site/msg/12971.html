<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree, W!  I asked one of my communicators the other night what kind
of being he considered himself to be.  The answer was, &quot;Ex-human.&quot;  I
took that to mean a person who was formally in a physical body but is
no longer. But who knows!?! 

I do believe that our loved ones and other person&#x27;s no longer residing
in the physical world can come through.  I&#x27;m also fascinated with the
idea of, as you mention, multiverses (reminds me of Drake&#x27;s Equation)
and I&#x27;m open to the possibility that other physical beings are somehow
communicating with us.  

There&#x27;s just so much that we simply do not know or understand.  What&#x27;s
the old saying, &quot;You don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know.&quot;  LOL.

&gt; Ditto to all you said Margaret, and I&#x27;ll further add that many times  
&gt; people
&gt; record all sorts of voices that we would consider &quot;non-human&quot;. I&#x27;m not  
&gt; sure why people
&gt; insist on stereotyping voices. Probably the ridiculous shows on the  
&gt; Travel &amp; Sci Fi Channels and superstitious religious
&gt; dogma.
&gt; 
&gt; There are many dimensions and Multiverses around us. No one can judge  
&gt; a voice based on it&#x27;s sound,
&gt; tone, or anything else. It&#x27;s too bad the media can&#x27;t simply report on  
&gt; the incredibly fascinating
&gt; research we are doing without wanting creepy drama.

&gt; &gt; For whom do you write? Where can we read some of your previously
&gt; &gt; published material?? Based on your question, I&#x27;m assuming you aren&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; looking to do the field of EVP/ITC or other paranormal research any
&gt; &gt; favors. What is your intention???
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How about focusing on something positive? That would be a nice change
&gt; &gt; of pace from the media. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find anyone here that is
&gt; &gt; willing to help perpetuate the negative stereotypical views on our
&gt; &gt; research or other nonsense that is a distraction from the fact that
&gt; &gt; there are valuable EVP/ITC advances taking place.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone ever get an elemental, demon, or otherwise &quot;inhuman&quot; voice?
&gt; &gt; Anyone hear from
&gt; &gt; &gt; someone with a dire warning? Anything else otherwise weird? I am a
&gt; &gt; journalist and would
&gt; &gt; &gt; LOVE to interview you about it!
