<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all, I&#x27;m a newbie to the site but not evp work. I&#x27;ve had great 
sucess with the standard recording style of using a handheld digital 
recorder. I have over 1,200 clips to date but needed a better way of 
recording evp&#x27;s. So I have purchased many microphones, a mixing board 
etc and it works great!I also have a Spiritcom and am slowly conducting 
experiments to improve the sound quality. This type of device allows 
two way communication but does not use a radio device. It uses only 
naturally occuring sound. I had read about the ITC and I made a simple 
pvc tube echo chamber and found the voices very clear from the 
recordings. The first one I got was a female saying &quot;I hear you in 
Plymouth.&quot; I frequently go to burrial hill in Plymouth Mass where so 
many 17th and 18th century graves are.This was a very clear voice. I 
will post it when I figure out how. I am experimenting with all kinds 
of techniques using the echo chamber and mics but the manual turning of 
the volume on my short wave radio is just great.That&#x27;s how I got the 
first voice.</pre>
