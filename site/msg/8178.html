&gt; If you use a recording program ...like Goldwave...you can actually 
slow them down while you listen to the playback, can ever listen to 
them backwards.  But I dont know of a way to slow down the sweep.  
Are you using the AM or FM band? And have you tried switching to the 
other band(the one ur not using)?  Ive tried a session on the FM band 
but it doesnt really seem to work for some reason but the AM does 
good and Ive gotten a response that indicates that they agree with 
the AM being better here.
&gt;    
&gt;   Rhonda           Hi Rhonda, I&#x27;m not sure what Goldwave is (is it 
used on a computer?)! I am currently online at the local library&#x27;s PC 
as at home I only have a Webtv unit to go online &amp; that&#x27;s limited! I 
have a Laptop, but it&#x27;s not connected to the internet - as I use it 
with DVD&#x27;s or software programes only.   =Judy=

&gt;           Hi All, Have been doing sessions and sometimes get a 
voice or more that 
&gt; just jumps in and says a word or two durring the scan, but most of 
the 
&gt; time it seems it&#x27;s like a room full of people talking very fast and 
&gt; thus I can&#x27;t seem to hear them well enough to hear if they are 
giving 
&gt; me any messages! Am I the only one with this issue? How can I slow 
this 
&gt; down to hear better? =Judy= P.S. I only use the RS 12-469 with 
&gt; portable folding Craig speakers &amp; a Sony cassette recorder with 
&gt; earphones (cups over ears). I sometimes use an external mic or just 
the 
&gt; cassette recorder&#x27;s mic.
