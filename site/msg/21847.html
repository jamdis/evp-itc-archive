Hello. I'm sort of new to the group. I've been observing but =
not posting much. Most of my experiences have been personal and I have deci=
ded to take it up a notch and join a group. My trouble has been that most g=
roups I have encountered are simply unorganized or unmotivated (in it for t=
he t-shirts). I went with a group recently to an old cabin for what turned =
out to be an hour and a half investigation. I got around 8 EVPs, some photo=
s, and a couple of noise responses on my recorder. My first attempt with a =
flash light got me a half an hour worth of consistent responses. When I got=
 my first recorder I got 3 EVPs while reading the instructions. I'm a magne=
t and for the first time in my life it doesn't scare me. What does scare me=
 is that my kids are just as effected. So I want to learn as much as I can =
on an interactive level so I can not only educate myself but protect my kid=
s. Is anyone in the Toledo area interested in doing investigations?

Here i=
s my personal page. It's a freebie website that I recently started to organ=
ize some of my evidence. Don't mind the construction. But here's a link to =
my EVPs on my recent investigation I mentioned above. I very much would app=
reciate any feedback or comments.

click here to see me recent evps

I woul=
d like to also know if anyone is familiar with the name "Attoy" (guess of s=
pelling)

I recently tried communicating on a box I got off of Ebay. I aske=
d for a name and heard "toy". I asked again and I again heard "toy".
I didn=
't think much of it until later that day my 2 year old climbs on my lap, lo=
oks at an empty space, gets very excited, starts waving and says "toy a toy=
"
I later asked my 3 year old if she knew anybody named "toy" and she corre=
cted me by saying "Atoy. He's a boy." I asked her how old he was. She looke=
d confused for a second and replied "He's still 4." She said he's happy, no=
t sick, little like her, and only says nice words. When I asked her where s=
he met him she replied "the living room." When I asked her how long he's be=
en there she unhesitatingly began to reply "5 years" but only said "5 ye" S=
he doesn't understand the concept of a year. She did say he's been there as=
 long as she can remember. I can remember my older daughter in a previous h=
ouse smiling and saying "hi" to nothing as a baby. I have EVP's of breaths =
from the house as well. They all sound like children. One I have is of what=
 I believe to be cheyne stokes. I only recognized this because I'm a nurse.=
 It's a particular breathing pattern that people sometimes have with immine=
nt death. I would appreciate any suggestions on how to communicate
 more wi=
th him.
