<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m not in it to be scared; I&#x27;m in it to hopefully learn something. I don&#x27;t
scare easily.

I have tried for dozens, maybe hundreds of hours to get an EVP recording at
my home with a regular digital voice recorder. I have never gotten a peep
there that way. I have also tried in locations that would not be suspect of
being haunted, like random open country roads and fields. I never got
anything in those either.  I have gotten many EVP&#x27;s in cemeteries and in
some buildings that were supposedly haunted. This makes me think that this
method does tap into something that is localized and exists only in small
areas.

I guess my house isn&#x27;t one of those locations.
:-(

I have gotten names on EVP&#x27;s a few times and in each case the name could be
associated with the location from past records (newspapers, hospital
records, etc.) These were names of real people long dead.

The radio scanning boxes may tap into a different kind of entity. I don&#x27;t
know. But my experiences indicate that &quot;ghosts&quot; do only inhabit certain
small areas and they do not go outside those areas.

&gt; I don&#x27;t mean paranormal activity, I mean--875 members and no one texting. I
&gt; think most are ghost hunters or &quot;investigators&quot; and waitng for something
&gt; scary to happen.
&gt;
&gt; If you want to &quot;investigate&quot; EVP, try staying home and recording. All the
&gt; fears about demons and what not entering your home is pure BS! I&#x27;ve been
&gt; doing ths stuff since 2000, don&#x27;t go the bogus haunted hot spot, record at
&gt; home almost daily as I test my junk, no frikkin&#x27; problems! Fro the most part
&gt; spirits, and the various entities exist in a higher level or demension, they
&gt; have full access to us anyway, there are no &quot;portals&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Yeah, I know, might as tell it to my dogs!
