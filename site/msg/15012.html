I have a running theory that EVP is carried o=
n an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest=
. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves th=
at differ one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them togethe=
r you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost =
is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creatin=
g an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate differ=
ence=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). =
This was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic=
 signals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP w=
ere generated within a few inches of the recorder.

We are able to repro=
duce this affect in not only radio with superheterodyne systems but also wi=
th acoustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce c=
alled the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.
