I have an older digital Walkman=\r\n AM/FM board. It use to be an AM/FM cassette, but I took the board out, and=\r\n threw the rest away. I ran acorss the board a month or so ago while lookin=\r\ng for FM radios that I could rob parts from. The Walkman board has been sit=\r\nting on my shelf for a couple years, I forgot all about it. I can use a swe=\r\nep generator to sweep the tuning on both AM and FM of this Walkman. Then ju=\r\nst make an amplifier for the headphone output to drive speakers. This is ho=\r\nw I make cheap systems, albeit one of a kind. I also want to experiment wit=\r\nh a diffenent method of making the sweep--get rid of the dual supply system=\r\n!\n \n Frank-S\n______________________________________________________________=\r\n___\nYou keep typing, we keep giving.
