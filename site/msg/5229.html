<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I purchased an am coil antenna from ebay called a &quot;select-a-tenna&quot;

It works by puting it in proximity to a radio or in our case a box 
and turning a tuning dial until the signal gets stronger.

It does not run on ac or batteries and does not hook up to the radio 
in any way. So I&#x27;m figuring how is this thing going to be any good, I 
get sucjh a crappy am signal that I was willing to try anything and 
have.

Well I recieved this antenna this morning and decided to take it to a 
part of the house where I have never gotten a signal, my basement.

I turned on the 470 and as usual nothing but static, so I placed this 
disc looking antenna about 8 inches from the 470 and started to turn 
the knob on the antenna. I was asking mike and lisa if they could to 
please come through. as I was turning this dial I began to hear the 
rs sweep the stations and mike said &quot;here&quot; I almost jumped out of the 
chair with excitement. I asked mike or lisa to tell me when the dial 
was right and as I slowly turned it mike yelled &quot;STOP&quot; after a few 
minutes of small talk I ended the session with lisa saying &quot;it&#x27;s good&quot;

That is testimony enough for me!

anyone that has even a slight problem with your am reception which I 
consider to be the best band to use. you have to get one of these.

Just go to ebay and search SELECT-A-TENNA it cost me 52.00 with 
delivery. to me it&#x27;s priceless.
