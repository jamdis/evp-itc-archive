If EVPmaker is set up to use the embedded cue list, the other settings such as Overlap, Zerocross, Crossfade, Segment size etc. don&#39;t apply, thus they will be greyed out. These options, and the &quot;Use Cue List&quot; option, exclude each other. If &quot;Use Cue List&quot; should be greyed out, then uncheck the other options.\n\nStefan\n\n----- original Nachricht --------\n\nBetreff: [EVP-ITC] Re: New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\nGesendet: Mi, 26. Mr 2008\nVon: Steve Hultay&lt;urkel23@...&gt;\n\n&gt; Stefan,\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s a great file, i&#39;m going to do a test session with that today.  \n&gt; Hopefully i&#39;ll get some good stuff, how did you have EVPmaker set.  \n&gt; Such as (overlap, z-cross,x-fade) and the number settings.  I&#39;m going \n&gt; to test out different ones, but was curious of how you set it up.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; &gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; &gt; group.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   File        : /Stefan/I little Sir help you eclipse.mp3 \n&gt; &gt;   Uploaded by : evpfan &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Description : Possible EVP (?) from an EVPmaker test session \n&gt; using the SpeakJet allophones as a source file.
