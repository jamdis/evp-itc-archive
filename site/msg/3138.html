<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My husband Allen and I were so pleased to be able to share time with 
you on the MiniBox at the Stanley Hotel this weekend. It was important 
for our engineer Ron, as well as our team at ASUP for you to see it and 
we deeply appreciate your cooperation and support.

So many of the main players in paranormal research were impressed with 
the device, and most of them will be the proud owners of the MiniBox 
soon. They were impressed with the quality of the construction, the 
portability, and the performance considering the more than reasonable 
cost of the unit. 

Thank you again!
