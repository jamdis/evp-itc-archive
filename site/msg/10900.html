&gt; This is pretty much directed to everyone.
&gt;    
&gt;   Hmm lets see I worked 2pm-11 last night then turn around and got 
up at 4 am to work 6-3 today so if we do the math we will see Misty 
just spent 18 of the last 24 hours on my feet and running around 
having to be in charge LOL. So please dont think I am going to spend 
my few hours freetime playing babysitter here.
&gt;    
&gt;   Quite frankly all involved have been told I do not have time for 
thier online dramafests. They can go fight each other all they wish 
to somewhere else its stupid. I am not thier mother and tho it is 
Mother&#x27;s day I do not feel any motherly tendancies towards anyone 
and that includes my friends. 
&gt;    
&gt;   As for research, while everyone is so wrapped up in the feeding 
frenzy against one another elsewhere, I still use my freetime to do 
research or spend time with those I actually get along with. I would 
suggest they give it a try. If they enjoy fighting...good for them 
more power to them and have fun...someplace else. 
&gt;    
&gt;   People here seem to think I am the boss. I tell you all now YOU 
are the boss of YOURSELF. You speak for yourself, your own actions 
and everything you say and do will be a representation of who you 
really are. Have a good look in the mirror to make sure that image 
doesnt resemble some of the things you hate about others. Positive, 
negative, good, evil, its up to you just like it is up to all 
spirits to choose how they treat others.
&gt;    
&gt;   I cant choose for you. But I will say I am here to learn more 
about ITC and do research. What are you guys here for? If its not 
one of those things then you simply joined the wrong group. Keep 
going you will find the right one they pretty much have one for 
everything these days.
&gt;    
&gt;   As for the BS we have been subjected to enough of it so people 
who post junk against each other simply will get it deleted and 
posting privledges moderated or removed. Find something better to do 
or someplace better to do it. 
&gt;    
&gt;   I do not control you all. Nor do I wish to. And I do not have to 
take a side in a fight I dont believe in.
&gt;    
&gt;   So my side is, at the end of the day I am tired. The fighting is 
dumb. And I am done wasting another minute discussing it. Those who 
post here should be posting about ITC or do not bother to post. If 
you feel that you have to fight with each other, fine go fight...I 
just dont want to be forced to read it nor do the members of this 
group who are here for the RIGHT reasons.
&gt;    
&gt;   On that note I hope that you all have a great day. For all the 
moms out there HAPPY MOTHERS DAY! I certainly hope it was a good one 
=)
&gt;
