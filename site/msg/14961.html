No biggie, in the internet is hard to read body language and facial express=

Sorry Frank,
It's just the way you worded =
your statement. made it seem like she was of no value. That's okay. I am ce=
rtain that I read a bit more into what you wrote. Sorry! 
I suspect that sh=
e may not have a lot going on in her life at the moment. Things are really =
tough up here in Michigan. We have the worst economy in the US. There are a=
lso other reasons, I am sure. But we may have all that she had going, you k=
now. 
Would like to add, God Bless her and all that she does.
