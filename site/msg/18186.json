Vague or partial answers would not be =\r\ncounted (for example, just&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; giving a color, shape, size, what=\r\n it&#39;s made of, etc): we&#39;re looking for what&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; it is. Answers a=\r\nnyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#39;t count.&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; Par=\r\nticipants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n &gt; &gt; they chose.&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; In order to keep me ho=\r\nnest, I took a picture of the object at the start of&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; the exp=\r\neriment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group.&lt;br&gt;\n =\r\n&gt; &gt; The idea with this file is that you could download it at the begi=\r\nnning of&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; the experiment and &#39;keep it safe&#39; on your computer.=\r\n Then at the end of the&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; experiment, I would post the passwor=\r\nd so you can reveal the contents of the&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; file. That way, you =\r\nwere in control of the original image during the entire&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; time=\r\n, not me.&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; Passworded pdf:&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &lt;a r=\r\nel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.pdf&quot;&gt;http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EV=\r\nP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ20100716. pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; The passw=\r\nord for that file is: 2plus2isFour&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; Instructions, if you need=\r\n them for the other files, are also in that RJ&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; folder.&lt;br&gt;\n =\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; So to the results:&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; N=\r\number of participants: 6&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; Total tries: 29&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; Ambi=\r\nguous answers: 0&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; Correct answers: 0&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n &gt;=\r\n &gt; Object: Chair&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; Object picture:&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &lt;a rel=3D=\r\n&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP=\r\n-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.jpg&quot;&gt;http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC=\r\n/files/ RJ/RJ20100716. jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; As a little si=\r\nde experiment, on Monday I also asked if anyone had gotten&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; a=\r\nny answers that might indicate an article of clothing (though I did not say=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; why I was asking). One theory is that the human operator ca=\r\nn be influenced&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; by things they already know or suspect, and =\r\nso interpret audio with their&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; own personal &#39;educated guesses=\r\n&#39;, that would differ from what they would hear&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; had they not =\r\nknown those things. This side experiment did indicate some&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; s=\r\nupport for that theory, since before I mentioned &#39;articles of clothing&#39;, no=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; one included an article of clothing in their results. But a=\r\nfter I mentioned&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; it, several reports of clothing began to ap=\r\npear. I did not add these tries&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; to the results above.&lt;br&gt;\n &=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas =\r\nfor improvement, let me&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt; know. Again, thanks to everyone who =\r\nparticipated in this experiment.&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n &gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n                 \n&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n       &lt;/div&gt;\n  \n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb=\r\n(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n \n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n      \r\n--0-1997864720-1279633475=:88831--"}
