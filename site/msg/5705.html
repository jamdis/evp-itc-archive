&gt; Robin,
&gt;  
&gt; It&#x27;s never a good idea to invite any spirits into your home.
&gt; Some demonic spirits have to be invited in before they can 
&gt; enter, there are instinces where people have heard knocks on thier
&gt; front door only to answer the door and have no one there.
&gt; The knocking by an entity and the opening by the physical being 
&gt; symbolises the request to come in and the invitation of the open 
door.
&gt;  
&gt; If you give out a ready made invitation, it could be like that 
annoying
&gt; relative that comes to visit and never leaves.
&gt;  
&gt; So be very careful whenever summoning any unknown entities.
&gt;  
&gt; If you need help with your box research or have any questions
&gt; don&#x27;t hesitate.

&gt; Yes Bruce, &quot;We want to kill you&quot; is word for word what I hear.  
Thank you for being the first person ever to validate this for me, 
because now I know it&#x27;s REAL, I&#x27;m not crazy, and it isn&#x27;t my 
imagination.  This was captured on a digital voice recorder while I 
was heating coffee in the microwave oven nearby, and I felt that the 
microwave must have been a powerful energy source for the &quot;speaker.&quot;  
It may be important to note that I had just invited spirits inside 
the house from outside, and that after I listened to this message I 
told them to go back outside because they were too rude to continue 
talking to.  I&#x27;ve tried to replicate this experiment a number of 
times since then (without the verbal invitation into my home) and 
have had no luck whatsoever.  
&gt;  
&gt; Gleefully moving on to box research!
&gt;

&gt; Robin, In the evp file you posted I believe I&#x27;m hearing &quot;we want to 
kill you&quot;please let me know if that is what you hear. Robin, I am 
glad to hear that the protection ritual will be utilized by you in 
the purpose it was intended. To give any individual that wants to 
anopportunity to use it. You will find many forms of interaction on 
this group, running the gamut from total agreement to calm 
debate /discussion. To full blown arguments.  That is what makes a 
group, If everyone followed one single ideology and the ideas of any 
single person without questionit would not be a group it would be a 
cult. Welcome to the wonderful world of box research robin, I&#x27;m sure 
you will be a valued member and researcher in this community. Bruce

&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m still giving this topic a lot of thought because I absolutely 
believe in the power of prayer, the power of positivity, and the 
power of ritual.  When I first started recording EVP a couple of 
years ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when it 
happened to me I felt elated rather than frightened or distressed.  I 
will ask again:  What physical or psychic harm is a disembodied 
entity capable of doing?  Please listen to the one EVP I&#x27;ve posted on 
this board and tell me what, if anything, you hear.  I know what I 
hear, and I consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is the 
response that has created the determination in me to continue 
researching the unknown.  
&gt;  
&gt; Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings.  I only want to learn as 
much as I can from you and the other dedicated researchers on this 
board.  It never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in the 
past, and that&#x27;s about all I can say.  I will probably use one from 
this point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract 
goodness.  
&gt;  
&gt; So, thank you for this contribution.  I think the debate has been 
an excellent one, and I&#x27;ve appreciated the opportunity to be 
enlightened.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; I swore I would not get wraped up in this debateBUT!The reason I 
came up with this whole protection ritual was that some of the new 
researchers whereexpressing a rational concern for negative responces 
that they were recieving through thier boxes.The short protection 
ritual that I posted is not meant to quell irrational histerical 
fear, and I agreewith rosemary that anyone suffering from such fear 
should rethink thier involment in the paranormal research field.that 
being said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal comfort to 
those new individuals that had never expperienced spiritual 
negativity. And to help ease them into aproaching a session 
eventually with confidenceand determination as well as full 
curiousity for all types of the communication we recieve.My initial 
post of the ritual file was done with the best of intentions and 
meant to be another tool available for those who felt they needed or 
wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer ritual, I don&#x27;t 
think it is really worthy of all this debate.Use it, don&#x27;t use it. 
It&#x27;s there if you want it. Also I must say there are two kinds of 
fear the kind that is natural and a god given emotion for self 
preservation, ie the fright and flight reflex that is an instinctive 
trait in all of us. Then you have the irrational dibilitating phobic 
fear that can turn an individual into a frozen statue. That type of 
fear I believe is unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt with and 
learned how to harness. I also believe that anyone that harbors that 
type of fear would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a 
case of such fear it would already be present and doing a small 
protection ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take it for 
what it is, something to utilize in our box of tools like an emf 
meter.you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the bottom of 
your tool box at home that you inherited from your grandfather and 
have never usedbut if you come across that odd nut that needs 
tightening somedsy you will be glad you have it.Bruce
