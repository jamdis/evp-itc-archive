<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey guys  I am wondering how has the research been working with the 
EVPMaker, and what is the different settings that everybody has been 
using to get the best results?

Myself, I haven&#x27;t had too much luck with it, but I&#x27;m still working with 
it. I haven&#x27;t use it but 3 times. I know some people here has been 
getting great results, and I was wandering if they could post their 
settings they have been using to get these results.  Please share the 
knowledge!
