I am  \nsitting here checking my email so i just thought i&#39;d\nturn it on  \nand... not check my email.  Anywho.... Then right at\nabout 6:20 i  \nheard a voice say  &quot;Nicholas Etheridge please turn off\nthe dsfnlsd&quot;   \nnot quite sure what word it used... possibly portal. \nI just thought  \nit was weird.  Also under all of the jumble and this\nvoice speaking i  \nheard a deep male voice almost chanting &quot;seven&quot;.  Not\nsure if I  \nactually heard this or its the want to have an excuse\nto stay home  \nand not take the HSAs.\n\nAnyway.. just curious if anyone has gotten heard this\nor if they know  \nsomething I don&#39;t about using the box in the morning.\n\nPeace,\nNick\n\n    \n          \n\n\n    \n          \n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nNever miss a thing.
