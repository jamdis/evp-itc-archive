I hear you can get the parts at\nRadio Shack. If you know what I&#39;m talking about, please give me some\ninfo. Also, if anyone can make a Frank&#39;s box, I&#39;d be more than willing\nto buy one. Being not of technological mind, I can&#39;t decipher the\nplans. I am part of a fledgling group in GA, and we are dying to get\nour hands on one of these things."}
