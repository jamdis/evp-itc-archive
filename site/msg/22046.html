=C2=A0 

For having 900 members, this board is a ghost town=
. When i first joined this 
group in 2007, it was the only group dedicated =
to this and it was a rockin' 
forum. 


We used to get between 1500 to 2000=
 posts a month, now it gets like 15 to 20 
posts a month. Not sure what hap=
pened here. If each member here posted twice a 
month, it would be like 180=
0 posts.

I'm sure that somebody has to have something to say.
