Hey Steve, so sounds like they need a radio to speak with us.
   
  I have listened to your EVP and I think I said this before, you seem to have a good set of regular spirits communicatong with you on a regular basis.
   
  Have you yet determined if the group you link with have a group, ie like the EVP-ITC group we have her on the earth plane, and if they do, have you been able to determine what their intent is to reach us?
   
  For example, we tend to want to know what happens when we die, and where we go, if our loved ones meet us, and then what happens after that, or some of us tend to want to help either the living contact their loved ones in the spirit world, or to help the spirits contact the living or even help spirits move on from where they are.
   
  When they contact you, Steve, what is it that they want from us? Same I would imagine, but are any of them trying to tell us to change our ways, or warn us of anything to come, etc...
   
  Some of us on this group are already helping others here and there, and some are even helping the police agencies with what they learn.
   
  If they have a team like us,  what is the name of their group of like minded spirits?  What can all of us learn from them that we can share with humanity? 
   
  To all on cc, are any of you or have any of you written books on your EVP experiences which share what you have learned?
   
  Please share what all of you have learned from them that can help humanity move forward in a positive way.  
   
  Like do they advise what we can do to bring about world peace?
   
  Mike Edwards Cary, NC
