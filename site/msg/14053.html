<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was just sayin&#x27;!  So why would anyone in this field completely ignore
methods that work, irregardless of whether science accpts it? That&#x27;s the
thing, say anything and I&#x27;m the one being negative. Question these other
experts and I&#x27;m being negative--on and on.

 Same old story--don&#x27;t accept the evidence, don&#x27;t accept that that
someone-like me-does in fact at least understand what conditions to create
to make these communications possible. Yet y&#x27;all wonder why I have a case of
the ass all the time. All the pompus self proclaimed egotisical little
dweebs out there chasing the damn fame and fortune--not facts.

 I have gotten so much friggn&#x27; voices that can&#x27;t be explained as anything
but spirits/entity communication--not good enough!

 You hear that crap(any proof...) from every scientist/debunker--well if the
evidence was there we&#x27;d be the first to celibrate it-yeah right, rihgt after
they burned, burried, and debunked it. There is more than enough
evidence--all of it is ignored.

 The stuff is simple-provide something for the enitities to make their
voices out of and they will speak, no friggin&#x27; mystery, no magic, no secret
tecnology, no high priest(ess) needed.

&gt; Frank, I think you misunderstood or misread something somewhere. The
&gt; AAEVP/Sarah Estep Research Fund is not for AAEVP to do the research, it&#x27;s
&gt; for them to fund OUTSIDE organizations for THEIR scientific research on the
&gt; study of EVP. The Windbridge Institute received some of this sponsor money
&gt; for what they called &quot;Real-time EVP Conversations: A Pilot Study.&quot; The
&gt; method for this communication was *not* based on radio sweep, nor
&gt; traditional methods, so it&#x27;s not based on what I assume many people here are
&gt; doing. And in fact, it *was* based on the creations of someone outside of
&gt; the USA, so I&#x27;m a little confused as to why all the hostility toward AAEVP
&gt; for putting up the money.
&gt;
&gt; Sadly, radio sweep methods don&#x27;t, and may not for a long time, get the
&gt; respect of the scientific community that it deserves (then again, seems no
&gt; form of EVP does), but at least this current research is a step in the right
&gt; direction. I hope, when Windbridge concludes their study, that it will
&gt; support the notion that there is apparent communication formed in ways that
&gt; cannot be explained by currently known and understood laws of nature. THAT
&gt; alone, in my opinion, would be a big plus for all ITC communities,
&gt; regardless of the method from which that communication was received. What&#x27;s
&gt; the old saying? &quot;It takes but one white crow to prove all crows are not
&gt; black.&quot; Any proof, derived from any EVP method, would be greatly welcomed as
&gt; far as I&#x27;m concerned.

&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s the same old stuff, everyone wants to completely ignore absolutely
&gt; all
&gt; &gt; work that has been in this field since the caveman and act like they just
&gt; &gt; discovered spirit and EVP. Completely ignore all the work in this country
&gt; &gt; and in Europe, and if anyone says anything, oh well, you&#x27;re just being
&gt; &gt; negative! Why everyone knows there no EVP/ITC research outside AAEVP!
