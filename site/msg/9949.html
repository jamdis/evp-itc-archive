&gt;  Sorry Ann, I don&#x27;t understand the way you use the word Charity.   
&gt; How is it charity when your trying to get all your investment  
&gt; back?  No offense Bruce

&gt; Oh, and I want to jump in here and say that if anyone thinks that  
&gt; Bruce shouldn&#x27;t try to get his investment in his mini back on ebay  
&gt; or any other sales venue, I suggest practicing such charity oneself.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; A few people have seen my ebay listing and commented about the  
&gt;&gt; price
&gt;&gt; &gt; listed.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Ebay will not allow you to change a description after the item has
&gt;&gt; &gt; been listed. They do however allow you to add and amending  
&gt;&gt; statement.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Which I have done In Big Bold Red Letters, the price listing was a
&gt;&gt; &gt; mistake. I am certainly not trying to misrepresent the item or  
&gt;&gt; make a
&gt;&gt; &gt; profit on it.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I have also lowered the reserve price on it as a result of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; mistake.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Believe me I will be taking a loss on the box.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I have already sent my apologies to Rick Moran from Paranormal
&gt;&gt; &gt; systems.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; And now extend my apologies for the mistake to anyone that was
&gt;&gt; &gt; interested in it.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; The reason for selling the MB was not the money, it was the  
&gt;&gt; guilt of
&gt;&gt; &gt; having this excellent piece of equipment go without the  
&gt;&gt; attention it
&gt;&gt; &gt; deserves. And the hopes that someone or some group can utilize it
&gt;&gt; &gt; more than myself.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; But I could not as much as I would have liked to, give it away.
&gt;&gt; &gt; My intention was to get back at least a decent amount of my
&gt;&gt; &gt; investment.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I hope no one gets the wrong idea and thinks ill of me.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Bruce
