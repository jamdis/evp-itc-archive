One good and helpful and the  \nother not.\n\nYeah, it&#39;s a good site. I think we&#39;re all mediums to a lesser and  \ngreater extent. Some seem to have a natural knack at being sensitive  \nand some don&#39;t - some are in between. I tend to feel it&#39;s a talent  \nlike being a natural musician, singer, or artist. Some have it  \nnaturally, some don&#39;t, some can learn by being taught, but aren&#39;t ever  \nas good as the naturally gifted.\n\nw.\nOn Aug 18, 2008, at 12:46 PM, Ron Lederer wrote:\n\n&gt; w. I just finished a couple hour review of the web site you sent for  \n&gt; Sandra Belanger at http://www.heliumraven.com/home    Man did that  \n&gt; answer a lot of questions I had about how this technology can work  \n&gt; with mediumship/spiritualism.  Also renewed my hope in working with  \n&gt; evpmaker.  The case history that Sandra recounts on the site should  \n&gt; be a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone serious about evp.itc.  I would like to  \n&gt; understand more about the relationship between evp and mediumship.   \n&gt; Does a &quot;good&quot; evper need to be a &quot;sensitive&quot; or medium or does it  \n&gt; just give someone with the sensitivity the edge over someone else?   \n&gt; Even Sandra now says that she had a certain amount of &quot;sensitivity&quot;  \n&gt; before she started using evp technology and that now she actually  \n&gt; &quot;communicates directly&quot; with spirit.  To me that means she is a  \n&gt; medium....no?\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, regarding the Fish Group...I was taken back to read on her  \n&gt; website that The Fish Group was helpful in having her &quot;solve&quot; the  \n&gt; Lacy Peterson case.   Chalk a good deed up to The Fish Group.    \n&gt; Thanks for the web site.  Ron l\n\n\nI 's because o he wo k and some o F ank S.'s s u ha I ha e o wonde i he e a e 2 \"Fish G oups\".
