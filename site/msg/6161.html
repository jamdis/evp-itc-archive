I don&#x27;t know what to think, honestly.  I was very surprised to hear 
that response directly after my question.  There was no cutting or 
enhancement, except trimming it out of the original audio and 
normalizing it to 60db after direct recording it.

My guess would be that whatever agenda is being driven by 
the &quot;voices,&quot; they may already have enough people in place (or even 
in mind) with what they wish to do.  The reason I say this is 
because it seems many of the people are receivng the same techs 
through these devices.  I personally believe I received responses 
yesterday from &quot;Mike &amp; Lisa.&quot;

Yet, I still wonder if they are referencing the time being short, 
with respect to whatever is coming.  Maybe they mean the thinning of 
the veil between spirit and physical??.

How many technicians are out there?  How many have been identified?  
I know mine have been male-female sounding...others?

&gt; Wow. Nice and clear, LC.  What&#x27;s your interpretation on the 
comment?  
&gt; That it&#x27;s already a done deal or it&#x27;s too late?
