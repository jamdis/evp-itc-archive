I think the answer depends on your plan for the f=\r\nile.  If it just for yourself, then I guess any name will do, that helps to=\r\n best organize your data, and helps you in your overall research or goals. =\r\n \n\n        And when sending it to others, it also depends on your goals.  I=\r\nf you&#39;re in phase of wanting to get confirmation of what you believe you ha=\r\nve captured, or general input on your technique, then maybe labeling it by =\r\nthe content works for that.  If you are in a phase where you want to improv=\r\ne your technique, and want verify, as objectively as possible, what you hav=\r\ne recorded, then naming it by perhaps the date and time and some sequence I=\r\nD number would be better, so as to remove as much potential as possible tha=\r\nt the name would influence the listener?\n\n        --- On Sat, 4/4/09, Paran=\r\normalEarl &lt;paranormalearl@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n          From: ParanormalE=\r\narl &lt;paranormalearl@...&gt;\n          Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Is pr=\r\nide so wrong!?\n          To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n          Date: Saturd=\r\nay, April 4, 2009, 2:57 PM\n\n\n          reading Rick&#39;s and Frank&quot;s comments =\r\nhere i started to wonder.\n          what is the best way to post EVP&#39;s ??\n =\r\n         i know to crop out the segment that has the EVP you want others to=\r\n hear \n          and see if they can make it out.\n          So do we label =\r\nthe file what they are saying or just mark it with a \n          number and =\r\nkeep track in a log file what that Number file says.??\n          I do like =\r\nthe idea of not labeling the file what it is saying to see if \n          th=\r\ney come up with what i think i hear.\n          But then again some times I&#39;=\r\nm tired and knowing what the file says when \n          I&#39;m listening to it =\r\nfrom some one else does help.\n          Earl..\n\n\n       \n\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_0070_01C9B69C.A776BD60\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18702&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 =\r\nface=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;I name mine with the recording time that the \nanomaly o=\r\nccurs and the machine it was recorded on.
