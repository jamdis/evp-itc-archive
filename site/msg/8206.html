Mike,
 
These are the responses as i heard them, listed in the order they =
apear in the folder.
 
1. NO
 
2.HEY MIKE
 
3.WHAT NAME
 
4.MIKE
 
5.YEAH (=
woman)_I SEE HIM (man)
 
6.MIKE_ said 2x
 
the responses are faint, you may=
 want to raise the volume of the box
or move the recorder closer to it, but=
 the responses are there.
 
After a while you will gain more experience in =
listening during a session,
as your ear becomes trained you will hear more =
communication in real time.
 
There is a tech on the other side, he happens=
 to be my tech and his name is Mike.
To insure he is not sending you his na=
me and in fact they are saying your name.
Next session ask that they call y=
ou a nickname of your choosing, to validate that it is you they are speakin=
g about.
 
good work.

I too am trying t=

I wonder where they go?
 
I am going to take =

Hey Mike
 
I had a good, q=
uiet Easter with just me and my son...he is 13 so we didnt do the easter eg=
g hunt or basket...and didnt do anything fancy for dinner....just stuffed b=
ell peppers and I made him some deviled eggs earlier in the day too.  Hope =
yours was a good one.
 
I just did my first session with the RS 12-470 yest=
erday. Before I turned the radio on....I started talking to the spirits tha=
t might be around..."Hey everybody, just wanted to let you know Im gonna do=
 a session with this new 470 box in about 10 mins....now Im new to it so do=
nt get frustrated if I dont hear you clearly"  
 
Then right before I turne=
d the 470 on I just started out imaging a white light surrounding me and pr=
otecting me from any negative energies or spirts out there. And I asked out=
loud for God to keep me safe and asked the spirits to please keep any negat=
ive spirits or energy away and to keep my house safe.  Then I said "OK I'm =
gonna turn on the box now and let it warm up a bit so you can get used to i=
t"  Turned it on(and my recorder...which Im using my pc right now for that)=
 and let it run for a couple mins, just so they could get used to how it wo=
rks...I figured since I was new to this then they probably were too. 
 
I a=
lso figured it couldnt hurt to talk to them beforehand...so they get to kno=
w my personality a bit.  Then I gave an invite for positive spirits to come=
 forward and feel free to check out and try the box and send any messages t=
hru they had....Then I  just introduced myself..."Hi everybody my name is R=
honda"(waited and listened for a bit)...."Is there anyone here who would li=
ke to say hello?" (waited for a lil bit and got a couple of Yes's and a No =
lol).  Just talked to them like they were sitting right here in my living r=
oom and we have known each other....joked around a bit..."Come on you know =
you wanna say hi"  
 
I tried to get them to say my name but that didnt hap=
pen...but if I turned it on and heard "Hi Rhonda!" I would prolly pick my j=
aw up off the floor and say HI!!!.  Also I felt it was polite to say thank =
you whenever they answered me...kind of a treat them how you would like to =
be treated(I do that in my normal everyday life anyways so its easy to be p=
olite).
 
Just kept any questions short and to the point...and my point was=
 a short get to know each other session...which Im gonna do a few more of..=
.dont wanna overwhelm them or me(lol).
 
I found too that I got the best re=
sults using the AM band...but I did a short stint in both bands to try it o=
ut. When I went to switch bands I asked them "do you find that the AM band =
was working best for us?  Heard a clear "Yes"  so I said "Ok...thank you...=
so Im gonna change it back to AM, is that ok with you?" Heard an "Ok"
 
I a=
ctually heard Frank mentioned but it was in my first part of my session whe=
n I had the box too far from the mic and the mic not on loud enuff to pick =
up either the box or me. So it wasnt recorded.
 
Im also an avid CBer by th=
e way...and ya its kinda like that...driving around gettin to know people, =
asking names(handles in CB lingo), if anyone is out there, and just shootin=
 the breeze like you would do if you were talkin to ur CB friends....and ju=
st letting them get to know you and vice versa.  I honestly wasnt expecting=
 to get much of anything...but was happy as a pig in poo with what I got.  =

 
So basically my whole goal or plan is just to make friends with them and=
 give them a chance and oppritunity to pass on their messages be it to me o=
r others(which I could pass on to them).  
 
I had come here with hopes tha=
t Id be able to contact my mom, who passed away Feb 21st of this year...but=
 I know that when I was doing EVP you dont always get in contact with who y=
ou are trying to and I started thinking...that maybe our loved ones have mo=
ved on to a different part of heaven...or maybe there is some kind of "prob=
ation" time for them before they can get out there and use the boxes and ra=
dios and do EVPs....not in a bad probation sort of way, more of a get used =
to not being on earth and being in heaven kind of way.
 
Everyone who has d=
one this on here has said dont go into a session if you are frustrated or a=
ngry, upset, irritated or even overly tired...cuz that can attract negative=
 energy to you....like a big flash light in the dark saying come on over Im=
 wide open...and thats not a good thing.  If you find yourself getting frus=
trated or upset during a session I would think it would be better to finish=
 up your session. 
Gotta remember, that its not easy for them to use energy=
 and those fragments of speech going by so quickly...it takes them time to =
get used to it just as it takes us time to get used to listening and gettin=
g our "ears". Practice makes perfect...but its sometimes not gonna be perfe=
ct and you cant let that frustrate you.  Most of the others on here have be=
en doing this for a long time and have a strong friendship with their techs=
/guides.
 
I think Id also compare it to meeting someone in person for the =
first time...for me, Im a shy person, very shy at times...until I get to kn=
ow someone then ya cant get me to shut up!  But it takes time to form that =
friendship and get them to open up...and takes time to get our "ears".
 
An=
yways I have prolly rambled on way too long for you....but wanted to give y=
ou my input...and like I said im new to the ghost box type communication bu=
t have done conventional EVPs for a while now.  Hopefully I havent steered =
you wrong and Im sure if I have someone will correct me =3D)
 
Also before =
you shut off your box you ask everyone who came across to please go back to=
 their side, give them a minute to do that and then ask them if its ok to s=
hut the door(shut your radio off)...when you get a conformation(I heard a l=
oud and clear "Do It"...then you thank them and say bye and shut er down.  =
That way you dont take the chance of leaving anyone behind in your house.
 =

Hope my ramblings helped ya a bit.

Hi all, and hope you all had a good Easter!
 
I keep =
listening to everyone's recordings and since they are clips of what you are=
 doing, my question is how do each of you start a recording to even get the=
se responses?
 
I write procedures and education instruction, and I am miss=
ing this piece.
 
So you pull out the radio
You plug in the external speake=
r
You turn the radio on
Then set the recorder to record
But how do you star=
t the recording?
 
I mean, do you start off by saying, "hi everyone this is=
 Bruce, or Kristn or Rhonda. Is anyone one there?"  Or do you start calling=
 out names, or do you even pray the night before that you plan to turn the =
radio on at 9am on such and such a date, or is it when you turn it on they =
are waiting for you?
 
Also lets say you turn the radio on, and a spirit sa=
ys hi Rhonda!. From there what is your response? What types of questions do=
 you ask? 
 
Is it more like a phone call to a family member, friend, or ev=
en just talking on a CB radio to truckers passing by trying to learn who th=
ey are etc.....
 
I am trying to step out a method for myself and it is fru=
strating me that I dont have a plan when I turn that rradio and recorder on=
.
 
Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!
