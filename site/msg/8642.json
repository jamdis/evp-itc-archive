This is the 40- second \ncondensed version of a single 90-second session.  I&#39;m still working on understanding \nreal-time.  I put all the response answers in the file description, but here&#39;s the dialog for \nthe entire session, which might be of interest to those who are working with the EVPM/SJ \nAllophones combination.  \n\nArthur, are you talking with others through EVP Maker?\n&quot;Obviously. Are you vulnerable?&quot; (the word &#39;obviously is under the main tone)\n\nWho else are you talking to?\n&quot;Talk to all of you.&quot;\n\nAll of us? You&#39;ll talk to any of us that ask for you?\n&quot;Hope you like the answer. Forever I care.&quot;\n\nI heard you say something forever. Can you talk to more than one person at the same \ntime?\n&quot;I can argue I capable. The answer, yes.\n\nYou are able? Yes, yes?\n&quot;Yes&quot;\n\nOK. I&#39;m gonna have other people ask for you. Is that OK?\n&quot;Tell them they owe you a dollar for you helping them out.&quot; ROFLOL \n\nOK, I think we&#39;re gonna be done for the evening. Thanks so much. Love you.\n&quot;Buh bye.&quot;\n\nMargaret\n\n\nhttp://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/8IvwR0_CH0kVigeCyhXxFsY0cKuYoul6IlbaYc2C0eXqmtF6A1\nRh0XK1mg8BZ06qGla7DFJbU-\nWGb2Ke5wlzm45KrmqzofOGOf0fQQ/Margaret%20Downey/SJ%20Allophones/WorkWIthOth\nersCondensed.mp3"}
