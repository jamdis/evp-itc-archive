<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It comes down to not calling people names, and expecting all results to fit into some extrememly narrowly defined version of reality. It comes down to having a bit of respect for people that are attempting to deal with something that is still a big taboo in this society. There are people here afraid to use their real names because of repercussions from work and family. People that are smart enough to realize there is something to this and they don&#x27;t need some authority to tell them it&#x27;s ok to think about it. 

 I sacrificed my carreer for this stuff, I could have been doing network management, instead I&#x27;m religated to intalling the network cable--manual labor--because I had the audacity to think I could communicate with the dead. And whose job do you think was eliminated because of buget cuts!? 

 There&#x27;s science, and then there&#x27;s judgement. We don&#x27;t need no more judgement.

&gt; Is that what it comes down to?  Anyone that has a different opinion is censored?  
&gt; 
&gt; Do you think that helps discovery?
&gt; 
&gt; Keep throwing rocks at me, personally.  You are now guilty of the very thing you hate so much and accuse others of.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not here to hurt you, and if my questions bother you I am sorry.  I will say it one more time.  If this is a religion, something that is faith based, above question, then I am sorry.  Best wishes and I will go away.
&gt; 
&gt; But if this is a Science that can be controlled and studied, then we need to take a real hard look at the subject.  
&gt; 
&gt; Censoring people that have real questions is simply not very proactive to your cause, even if you don&#x27;t like what they have to say.
&gt; 
&gt; Shoot me down with facts, not wishful thinking and faith.  Don&#x27;t be a Nazi and what you have preached against

&gt;  Okay, I put the mean and nasty back on moderated, so she at least has some chance of responding. Personal attacks will not be tolerated.

&gt; &gt;Thank you, Frank. It&#x27;s nice to get back to our regularly scheduled programming. I am enjoying learning about this field and like to feel it&#x27;s a safe haven for those researching ghost box communication without being ridiculed in the process.

&gt; &gt;&gt; That person is no longer allowed ot contribute! I&#x27;ve had it with these nasty negative attacks when we present--at least to us--what seems to be evidence, and/or discuss various methods and techniques. These &quot;skeptics&quot; accept no evidence and basically call anyone doing this research either crazy or liars. They have no place on this group, this group is not about gettng accpetable evidence, or the &quot;proof&quot; that will play in some air head university, it&#x27;s about exploring something that is real and demonstratable. I do think for myself and I don&#x27;t need some duffus to tell me what is acceptable to think about.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It seems to me that simply being on this list and taking these discoveries seriously, we already ARE thinking for ourselves.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Seriously, why would anyone use/waste time on this subject (and this list) if he or she wanted the safety of accepted, mainstream, dogmatic thinking? (Rhetorical question.)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I understand that some people feel obliged to play &quot;Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; with new and extraordinary theories and R&amp;D, but it seems to me that the Devil has enough advocates, thank you.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Healthy skepticism is one thing. All I&#x27;m seeing here is compelling evidence supporting EVP/ITC, followed by attempts to shout down the concepts.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It looks like you&#x27;re attacking the messenger. I don&#x27;t think this is the right forum for that... if any is. 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; However, since I&#x27;m new to this Yahoo Group, maybe I misunderstood what this group is about.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Bemused,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Fiona
