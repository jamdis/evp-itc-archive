Rather than adding the white\nnoise at the computer recording stage, I have a standalone dvd player\nwith a looping track. I have experimented with white and pink noise\ntracks, but was just curious which you have had the most success with.\nI also made a brown/red noise track, and wondered if you had\nexperimented with that at all. \n\nThanks in advance, you work has been very helpful in getting me\nstarted down this road.\n\nThanks,\nAndy\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot;\n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; For those who care to see...
