&gt; I am new here but I have had excellent success with using
&gt; running water in the background.

&gt; 
&gt;   Sweep tuning can be used on AM FM shortwave etc. I have
&gt; had some 
&gt;   success without tuning just allowing them to use the
&gt; static or water 
&gt;   noise thats in background. Best advice one cold give is
&gt; try it 
&gt;   yourself for a while and see what you come up with =)

&gt;   &gt; Why do you need to &quot;sweep&quot; the AM
&gt; spectrum? 
&gt;   &gt; Has anyone tried this but without sweeps on the
&gt; shortwave band? Has 
&gt;   any research been done? Could it be that the AM band has
&gt; some sort 
&gt;   of &quot;special properties&quot; that would allow such
&gt; communication? 
&gt;   &gt; Why is it that the AM band has to be used with a
&gt; radio station 
&gt;   playing? There are parts of the spectrum that is just
&gt; outside of that 
&gt;   spectrum that might provide a better form of
&gt; communication.
