 I'm 
done with this...
BY THE WAY I didn't say YOU SAID it was foul play i=
nvolved...I said "Well 
well...there it is! you have not had any luck on th=
e box so right away it 
doesn't work. Or there has to be a some foul play i=
nvolved. If I could suggest 
you find someone who does has had many session=
 with the box and sit in. But I'm 
sure you would find some excuse why it s=
aying whats its saying...what' s your 
take on it wait don't tell me...cb r=
adio lol" That was a statement I made on my 
own. Where does it say I said =
YOU said this!!
