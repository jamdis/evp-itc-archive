<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello

I&#x27;m a newbie at this place and would like to know the meaning of some 
of my EVPs, as I have many of them, one of the last ones says: &quot;COME 
WITH US, RECALL&quot; then I asked who were they, and they told me &quot;Ummitta 
people&quot;, I have seen ufos, but I don&#x27;t know if they can give messages 
as the ones of EVP, the very last one, says: CAN YOU HEAR ME ? Wow ! I 
want to know who is trying to communicate with me, as the voice is so 
human that it doesn&#x27;t seems to be a spirit, although they speak with 
low voice. But I am very astonished with the one of &quot;come with us&quot; 
and &quot;Recall&quot; I don&#x27;t know what do I have to recall, I do my EVPs with 
my cell phone, I have time with this practice but lately the 
communications are so clear that I doubt that they can be of the spirit 
world, can some of you help me to understand the message please ???

Kind regards
Neli</pre>
