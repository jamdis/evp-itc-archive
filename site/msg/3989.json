I think it will be a good, informative\n&gt; &gt; show. I was able to deliver the very first of the production\n&gt; &gt; mini-boxes to Rosemary this past Sunday while on the Queen Mary. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We spent time with all the different devices. The RadioShack Hack was\n&gt; &gt; very surprising!! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; All of this technology is fantastic. So glad to see so many minds\n&gt; &gt; working out there to combine and create ideas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Have a great show Rosemary!!! :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Hi Rosemary & All,  I enjoyed hearing  you on C2C tonight talking about Frank&#39;s Box, the Mini Box, & the &quot;RS Hack&quot;! I am testing/researching with my RS 12-469, now and have gotten a few clearly audible EVP/voices!  Seems it&#39;s trail & error to get the voices . . . . practice, practice, practice helps I feel.  =Judy="}
