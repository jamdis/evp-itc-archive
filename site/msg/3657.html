I think your mistaking the 12-469 f0r the 12-470
 
they are different in function and price and you 
can no longer get the 12-470 old model.

      hey guy's if anyone wants a 12-470 old style white and silver the 
modifyable model. I have four extra, who ever wants one e-mail me and 
you can have it for what I paid 40.00+ shipping and I'll send it to you.

I guess the only fair way to do it is the first four e-mails gets it.
