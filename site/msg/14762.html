I think the bottom line is we all know that Chris Moon is probably just try=

  Exactly my point... You don't charge anyt=

  and Chris Moon charges people for using it....
  If it=
's not perfected then Chris shouldn't charge either......
  If he wasn't so=
 public with it, then people like me wouldn't dislike him so much.

  The o=
nly people that have your boxes (that the public hear about)
  are the well=
 known paranormal groups and famous people.
  I am sure that you have given=
 boxes to researchers who are not in the popular
  paranormal community ,an=
d don't want to be. Those are the ones that should
  get respect.  And of c=
ourse YOU are well respected by us lowly researchers. ( Kissin up , so you =
won't get mad)

  And I am sure that you are sick of hearing about Chris Mo=
on and how
  alot of people thinks he sucks. And everyone wants a box......=

  But you have to expect that. You are the only one out there that is hone=
st and
  doesn't want to be famous.
  I know this is like beating a dead ho=
rse, so I will shut up now.... :)
