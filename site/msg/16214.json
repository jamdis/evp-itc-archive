I=\r\n certainly do not claim to be a braniac or a know-it-all, as you have calle=\r\nd me in your post.\n\n          In fact I am saying the opposite: I am saying=\r\n that I do not know:  I am saying I do not know how anyone can believe thes=\r\ne 2012 predictions when all they have is stories and questionable claims.  =\r\nI don&#39;t know how they can believe this stuff when they actually DO have evi=\r\ndence that all the similar claims in the past have been shown to be false. =\r\nI do not know why they believe this claim is any more justified than all th=\r\ne others,\n\n          I do not know how the group can say on its home page &quot;=\r\n It&#39;s one thing to be skeptical, it&#39;s another to ignore and deny all eviden=\r\nce.&quot;, yet it is the people who are certain of the 2012 prophecies that seem=\r\n to be ignoring and denying evidence that it is only one more in a long lin=\r\ne of unsupported failed predictions, not those who are skeptical of it.\n\n  =\r\n        I do not know how it justifies you referring to me as  a &quot;wanne be =\r\nbrianiacs claiming to know all&quot;, when the group home page suggests such att=\r\nacks get people banned.  I do not know how being skeptical of a future prop=\r\nhecy makes one a know it all. And I do not know how prompting people to jud=\r\nge for themselves makes me a know it all. \n\n          And I don&#39;t know why =\r\nthe group home page says a good argument is ok, yet you start name-calling =\r\noffended when someone questions something you do not agree with, or propose=\r\ns a theory alternate to your own.\n\n          So call me ignorant.  Obviousl=\r\ny I really don&#39;t know very much at all.  \n\n          But of the very few th=\r\nings I do know, I now it is good to question, and not take everything, espe=\r\ncially prophecies, at face value.  And I know the best way to test a prophe=\r\ncy, and the people making them, is to see if they actually come to pass.  A=\r\nnd I know that since no evidence can support a prophecy&#39;s truth until it co=\r\nmes to pass, and since all past end-of-world prophecies have no evidence of=\r\n their success, that those who think they know something special about why =\r\n2012 is different, certainly know more than I.\n\n          And so I hope the=\r\ny (or you, if you count yourself among them) will post your evidence, and y=\r\nour predictions, and your dates.  And we won&#39;t have to argue about it.  We =\r\ncan just put that person, and their predictions, and their dates, on our ca=\r\nlendars, and judge when the date comes, who was really acting as a know-it-=\r\nall.  \n\n          One thing I think we can all agree on:  one knows it all.=\r\n Not me, not you, and certainly not a collapsed MesoAmerican civilization.\n=\r\n\n          Rj\n\n\n\n\n\n          --- On Wed, 10/14/09, purplespacefriend &lt;purpl=\r\nealiengirl@ gmail.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n            From: purplespacefriend &lt;purple=\r\naliengirl@ gmail.com&gt;\n            Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: 2012 is not the en=\r\nd!\n            To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n            Date: Wednesday, Oc=\r\ntober 14, 2009, 6:56 PM\n\n\n              \n            I stopped getting the =\r\ngroup e-mail months ago, I should also stop reading the posts as well.
