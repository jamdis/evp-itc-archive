<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You&#x27;re right and i&#x27;m not here to argue with anyone.  You obviously 
don&#x27;t know me, but dislike me.  That&#x27;s ok, i like to get along with 
people; it helps the research move forward.  I would love to hear some 
of your files from your frank&#x27;s boxes and compare notes on what we&#x27;ve 
been getting.  My results are in the files section here.

&gt; So have I. So has Misty. So has Frank. Mike too. I could go on &amp; on.  
&gt; There are many here and on other lists who have contributed years of  
&gt; free time way before you showed up on the recording scene.
&gt; Does it matter? No.
