I think it might be interesting to see how others are using \ntheirs.\nI shared how I use my three 12-469 radios through a mixer, with white \nnoise and into a laptop.  http://www.ufogeek.com/?p=108\nHow about anyone else? How are you using yours?\nLet&#39;s get those ideas flowing!!! :-)\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve completed my first audio test of my &quot;Spiricomp&quot; (not Spiricom) \n&gt; setup.  It&#39;s three Radio Shack 12-469&#39;s, a mic, and white noise fed \n&gt; into a mixer, then output into a laptop running audio capture \n&gt; software.
