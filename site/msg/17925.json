I woul=\r\nd post one \n  if it ever actually seemed proof &lt;br&gt;&gt; of intelligent comm=\r\nunication to me: \n  for example, a bunch of consistent &lt;br&gt;&gt; predictions=\r\n, posted before the \n  event, read by all, then confirmed afterwards. &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; That would be the only \n  worthwhile thing to post that I can think of.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Since I have \n  never gotten anything like that, I have n=\r\not posted it.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; And I \n  notice neither have you.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; --- On Fri, 7/9/10, Frank \n  Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@ =\r\ngmail.com&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; \n  From: Frank Sumption &lt;=\r\npurplealiengirl@ gmail.com&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: \n  [EVP-ITC] Last night=\r\ns files,&lt;br&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;br&gt;&gt; \n  Date: Friday, July=\r\n 9, 2010, 9:12 AM&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; So \n  RJ--where&#39;s your=\r\n EVPs?
