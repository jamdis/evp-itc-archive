I just had to return a pedometer for lack of doing \n&gt; research first. The stupid thing kept resetting itself throughout the day. I \n&gt; looked up reveiews because it was doing that to me, and it turns out that was a \n&gt; common problem with that brand.\n&gt; \n&gt; With bigger purchases I do research first, not after like the pedometer.
