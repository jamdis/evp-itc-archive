Both\nsessions only lasted about 15 to 20 minutes all together but I got 20\nclips!  Not all are great but some are pretty damn cool if you ask me.\n Juli helped me with a few already and found stuff that I didn&#39;t hear\nthe first time out.  SO thx Juli!\n\nIf you have time on your hands take a listen to my 20 plus files!! \nFeedback appreciated but not expected :-).  Although I will be\nchecking my email every 2 minutes LOL!  \n\n2nd day and all I can say is WOW!  Look for &quot;Kristin&#39;s Files&quot;.\nTHX!\nk"}
