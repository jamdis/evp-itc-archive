I will be in the San Diego \n&gt; and El Centro area from Feb 15 to 19 and I would love to be able to \n&gt; meet-up with someone from the area who has experience with EVP \n&gt; technology. Mike is sending a box already hacked so we can work \nwith \n&gt; the box and hopefully get something recorded. Since I have little \n&gt; experience as a newbie to this, I would love to see how someone \nputs \n&gt; all of it together...recording, analyzing, etc. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you have the time and are willing to give a little on-the-job \n&gt; training, please let me know by email. By the way, in mid June I \n&gt; will be traveling from Penn. to NC for two weeks and would love to \n&gt; get together with folks over in that area. I will probably be \n&gt; ordering a mini-box to be sent to my folks house in Allentown, so I \n&gt; will have that to play with. Let me know.
