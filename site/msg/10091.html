&gt; I listened to it too, and my first thought was this is a hoax. But 
if anyone here can test it, that would be interesting.

&gt;           Thanks Guy, I have heard a few people mention that O&#x27;Neil 
hoaxed it 
&gt; but I don&#x27;t know enough about this to really pass any sort of 
&gt; judgement. Looking forward to seeing your website.

&gt; &gt; In regards to the Spiricom story - I have to assume you&#x27;re 
&gt; referring to 
&gt; &gt; the Mark IV model as diagrammed/written up in the Spiricom manual 
&gt; (as 
&gt; &gt; opposed to the INCORRECT diagram made by Polish researcher 
Wojciech 
&gt; &gt; Drewniak...http://www.worlditc.org/k_06_spiricom.htm ).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; While my research is still not finished (and I&#x27;ve been working on 
&gt; this 
&gt; &gt; for a little over 2 years), I&#x27;m leaning toward the Mark IV 
&gt; &gt; conversations as having been hoaxed by Bill O&#x27;Neil. HOWEVER - I 
&gt; believe 
&gt; &gt; he acted alone and that none of the other members of the 
&gt; Metascience 
&gt; &gt; Foundation were involved with this hoax. As to O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s 
motivation 
&gt; for 
&gt; &gt; the hoax - I still don&#x27;t know. But I will also say that the 
&gt; veridical 
&gt; &gt; evidence that O&#x27;Neil claims to have received about Dr. George J. 
&gt; &gt; Mueller through clairaudience is amazing and it is tough to see 
how 
&gt; &gt; O&#x27;Neil would have gotten this information given his finances, 
&gt; location, 
&gt; &gt; the timeframe, etc.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve been promising to get my personal website up and operating 
for 
&gt; &gt; some time now but have been busy. Hopefully soon. Then I&#x27;ll start 
&gt; &gt; posting what I have found out so far.

&gt; &gt; P.S. The recordings of the Spiricom cassette that can be found at 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; GOS website ( http://www.ghostpix.com/spiricom/spiricom.html ) 
are 
&gt; very 
&gt; &gt; poor. Scott L over at Ghostly Talk pulled much a much cleaner 
&gt; version 
&gt; &gt; directly from a source cassette provided to him by Mark Macy ( 
see 
&gt; &gt; Ghostly Talk show archive noted as a &quot;Bonus&quot; and &quot;Repost&quot; for 
&gt; August 
&gt; &gt; 22, 2006: http://www.ghostlytalk.com/node/616 ).

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m new on this group. Not too sure whether this topic was 
&gt; &gt; &gt; discussed already or not but I wanted to get your oppinion on 
the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Spiricon device. Does anyone know more about it?
