<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Actually I&#x27;ve been there many times but still don&#x27;t see written 
directions. I see the links to the videos, which look wonderful, but 
on a dialup connection, take far too long to download.  Am I missing 
something there? Is there a direct link to the written instructions?

Thanks so much.

&gt;  Hi, and Welcome Katie;
&gt; 
&gt;  There&#x27;s instructions on ufo geek&#x27;s site, just do a goole on UFO 
&gt; geek, and you&#x27;ll go right to it. There&#x27;s menu on the left side that 
&gt; should have it listed. 
&gt; 
&gt;  Those RS radios are prabably the most economical way to start 
&gt; experimenting with that method.

&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m Katie, the founder of Fox Valley Spirit Hunters in Oshkosh 
WI.  
&gt; I 
&gt; &gt; have developed a lot of interest in the audio/video aspect of 
&gt; &gt; investigating and was pleased to find this group.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have a request.  I have been reading up on Frank&#x27;s box and the 
RS 
&gt; &gt; hack and have been curious to experiment with a gadget of this 
&gt; sort. 
&gt; &gt; However, I haven&#x27;t gone ahead until now, since I just 
unexpectedly 
&gt; &gt; found an older model 12-470 in our local RS store and snapped it 
&gt; up. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What I need are written instructions (versus the video) for the 
&gt; &gt; modifications needed.  Unfortunately, hubby and I live in the 
stix 
&gt; and 
&gt; &gt; do not yet have high speed access. THe videos look wonderful but 
&gt; simply 
&gt; &gt; take far too long to download on dialup for us.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is someone out there in possession of written instructions and 
&gt; would 
&gt; &gt; they be willing to share them?  I would really appreciate it.  
Thx!
&gt; &gt;
