&gt; So I submitted a request to join the RTSC yahoo group, and it was denied. I
&gt; continue to be blown away by the fears and insecurities and cliches of some
&gt; of the people involved in RTSC. The group says:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;This Board is dedicated solely to the research of Real Time Spirit
&gt; Communication. Any form of devices that are used in 2-way communication are
&gt; welcome here openly for all to share. This group is for the discussion,
&gt; promotion and development of new ideas to further this research. This group
&gt; was designed to take the next step in EVP to get away from conventional
&gt; methods. -Steve Hultay&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I suggest it add:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Unless you ask questions, experiment outside our box, or don&#x27;t agree with
&gt; what we state is so. Then you can&#x27;t join&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Amazing.
