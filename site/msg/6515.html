<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yep I agree with a few files there is some loss in conversion. Thats 
why I sent out that program because it has next to no loss in the 
conversion. But again I will say I would rather post 1 meg of files 
than take up the entire groups space by posting 15 megs of files. 
When I want to share more complete audio I just use my esnips.com 
account to do that. It is just as easy for people to click on my 
esnips hotlink in a notification post as it is to click on the files 
link to the left.

You are right we just have to manage ourselves better.

&gt; I post in wav. format I believe when you convert the file from wav 
to mp3.
&gt; certain aspects of the file are lost. If an mp3. file is a tenth of 
the size of
&gt; a wav. file where does the other 9/10&#x27;s go.
&gt;  
&gt; If it is compressed then it definitely loses quality. 
&gt; I think every nuance in a box file is crucial for the 
&gt; correct interpretation of the file, sometimes the a word created by 
the entity is not only
&gt; comprised of radio fragment but also static noise mixed with the 
fragments of radio vocal
&gt; to form the message the entity wishes to leave. I don&#x27;t know the 
technical aspects of the file 
&gt; change but I think it&#x27;s common sense that when you try to pour a 
gallon of water into a shot glass
&gt; all you wind up with is a shot glass full of water the rest is 
spilled and lost.
&gt;  
&gt; I keep my files posted for 5 or less days, just long enough for 
anyone that wants to listen can.
&gt; If your going to leave your files posted indefinitely and keep 
adding to the folder then of course it will
&gt; put pressure on the storage space.
&gt;  
&gt; As far as posting a notice for every file, some of us may wish to 
listen from their e-mail or not 
&gt; have to go to the file section to listen, That&#x27;s probably why that 
option is given.
&gt; If I didn&#x27;t like the notices cluttering up my e-mail in box you can 
change that feature in the group
&gt; membership options. So if anyone does not want that feature they 
can turn it off and only read posts on the group.
&gt;  
&gt; It&#x27;s not the lack of space is the mismanagement of it by all of us. 
&gt; when I change my files from wav. to mp3 I hear a distinct 
difference, do it in an audio editor and you can visually see the 
difference.

&gt; That&#x27;s a great idea Steve and it was mentioned before but either no 
one noticed Misty&#x27;s post or it was ignored. It would be a shame 
though if people start loosing files because they are not paying 
attention to the owners instructions.Regards,Frank R.

&gt; 
&gt; Misty,I have and idea. One solution is to post Mp3 files instead of 
Wav. files or any other format. It seems like the Mp3&#x27;s sound the 
same and are only 1/10th of the size. I think that would probably 
clear up 90 percent of the board right there. If i actually have more 
than a couple files from here on out, i will be attaching them to an 
e-mail and not the board to save space here. And also, if people do 
post files maybe we can all just have one post that says we have 
uploaded files to our folder instead of 30 audio announcements in a 
row that just seems to waste a lot of e-mail space in the individual 
e-mails. And it also pushes the current topic on the board to another 
page and is lost for those who wanted to share. Just my thoughts on 
helping the subject. I know we are all excited, but misty is right. I 
went to add a file the other day and the group was at 93 percent 
capacity, so it won&#x27;t be long before we run out of space.-Steve H.---

a little friendly reminder that you all need to organize your &gt; files 
better in the files area. Space is limited here and you are all &gt; 
nearing the 100% mark so try to keep your section under 5 megs. If &gt; 
you need more space use www.esnips.com and you can store 50 gigs to &gt; 
share with the group or public.&gt; &gt; I think it is great you guys have 
so much to share I just wish that &gt; our yahoo group wasnt so limited 
on space (and that I wasnt so &gt; limited on time). But I have found a 
way around it. If just a few &gt; people signed up and shared using 
esnips they can invite others to &gt; visit thier files and once they do 
they also get 50 gigs of free &gt; space for audio pictures or video or 
whatever you want to post.&gt; &gt; I was considering setting up 
one &quot;group&quot; account to start with and &gt; inviting all members who post 
files to join it and be able to post to &gt; the account. It will 
automatically notify everyone thats a member &gt; when a file is added 
to it just like the yahoo group does. It also &gt; allows you to share 
with the public or privately if you so choose. &gt; You can even allow 
your friends to post to your account if you wish.&gt; &gt; This group has 
grown and expanded and we just need to make a few &gt; changes to how we 
do things to keep it running more smoothly for the &gt; future. I am 
hoping that you all will help me in this endeavor. I &gt; know many of 
you have already adapted the idea to help us organize &gt; and maintain 
the group.&gt; &gt; I want you to keep sharing and to be able to share 
more! &gt; &gt; So please organize and not post stray files that are 
targets for &gt; deletion once the que is 100% full. And for your own 
sake, if no one &gt; elses, be respectful to each other.&gt; &gt; MD&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo! Mobile. 
Try it now.
