Pixelization doesn't clean-up the data: it replaces it.=A0 Imagine taking =
a picture of a field of flowers, and beginning to add levels or pixelizatio=
n to the picture.=A0 Soon, you would not be able to tell there were flowers=
 there at all.=A0 You would see a lot of colored blocks.

Or in the other d=
irection, imagine you are looking at a competely randomize bunch of pixes o=
n your screen: a complete screen of truely random static snow.=A0 Pixelizin=
g this, after a while, you would again start to see colored blocks.

What's=
 happening is that it is processing an area of the image, taking (for insta=
nce) the average value of that entire area, and replacing all the blocks in=
 that area with the average.=A0 In video processing, this would result in a=
 field of multi-colored flowers being replaced by, for instance, a big grey=
ish-bluish block, with no resemblance to flowers.=A0 In the noise example, =
it maybe replace all the random pixels with another big greyish-bluish bloc=
k.=A0 If you did not know beforehand what the original picture was, you cou=
ldn't tell whether your pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a ch=
evy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.

It works the same w=
ith the sound files.=A0 Taking something as complex as speech, and replacin=
g frequencies with their averages, loses the speech the farther you go, unt=
il you head strange fluctuating square waves.=A0 Doing the same to random s=
tatic will eventually produce the same thing.=A0 And random fluctuating squ=
are waves can sound a bit like speech - or at least, you could have fun sha=
ring with each other what you thing they 'sound like'.

Be a bit careful of formats like mp3 if you are doing a detailed ana=
lysis of the sounds though.=A0=A0 While some formats (like wav) can store t=
he audio very close to the way it was recorded, formats like mp3 compress t=
he file, and in so doing lose some of the sonic details.=A0 This may not be=
 a big deal in music, where the audio is fairly clear to begin with.=A0 But=
 with sound sources with a lot of noise (like evps), this can not only obsc=
ure any real sounds, but pixelize non-sounds (like white noise) and make th=
em start to sound like speech.

So mp3 might be good for sharing the data, =
once you've already formed an opinion based on an analysis of the wav file.=
=A0 But mp3 is not good as a medium for analysis.=A0 It can lead to many fa=
lse positives and misinterpretations.
