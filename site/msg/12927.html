&gt; Well, if we think scientifically according to physics, all 
we &quot;see&quot;  
&gt; with our body&#x27;s eyes is a illusion... waves of light and there are 
an  
&gt; unknown amount of dimensions coexisting with us all the time, our  
&gt; experience - or what we perceive as &quot;experience&quot; becomes a 
powerful  
&gt; illusion.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;d probably use the term &quot;active&quot; area if forced, but are there  
&gt; really areas and some energies are residual and not intelligent at 
all  
&gt; - just a glitch of what we perceive as time and not intelligent.
&gt; 
&gt; I think it&#x27;s important to really keep an open mind in this 
research.  
&gt; We are so confined and limited by our own energy&#x27;s perception via 
our  
&gt; experiences encased in this form of a body that we simply can&#x27;t  
&gt; stereotype our research with terms based on common Hollywood/TV 
shows  
&gt; like Ghost Hunters or religious ideas.
&gt; 
&gt; We know so little! We &quot;record&quot; and &quot;listen&quot;, some try to 
stereotype   
&gt; or label energies with other&#x27;s ideas of what they are hearing or  
&gt; talking with. That&#x27;s impossible at this point to prove. So I beg 
all  
&gt; of you to keep an open mind ALWAYS.
&gt; 
&gt; What may sound like your Aunt, Grandmother, or child, may not be 
and  
&gt; probably isn&#x27;t. It could literally be anything or anyone from 
anywhere  
&gt; and any space in time. We simply have no clue... yet!
