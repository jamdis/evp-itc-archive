<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I just did my first &#x27;469 today too, but I did major surgery on it, 
so it&#x27;ll be alot different than the usual &#x27;469.

&gt; Well I went yesterday after work and picked up a RS12-469. Did the 
hack this afternoon surprising simple!! So if anyone can please help 
me with what else I need to get started I would appreciate it.  I do 
have some PC speakers and a small microphone to use. Not sure how to 
set it up.
&gt;    
&gt;   Thanks

&gt;             For me it was the 12-469, It has worked well with me.  
I did buy a 20-125, and hacked it correctly, and I didn&#x27;t like it.  I 
also didn&#x27;t get very much reception.  The 20-125 has a long anntena, 
and the 12-469 you can hold it in your hand, and you act as the 
anntena.  That way you get better reception.  Only problem with the 
12-469 is that it clicks a little, but I can&#x27;t hear it anymore.  I 
train not to hear it.

&gt;         I am looking at getting either the 12-469 or 20-125. Which 
would be the best to get for someone who is just starting out. I will 
be doing the Hack myself with a little help and instructions. I want 
to get something fairly easy to hack and use for a beginner.

&gt;         Radio Shack 12-469, 20-125 then you would have to modifiy 
it.  Some peps here can tell you how to do it, or you can go to 
ufogeek.com, and watch a video on how to do it.
