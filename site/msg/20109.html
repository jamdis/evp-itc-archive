<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s because there was nothing there to hear, no big deal.  It&#x27;s just one file, there are others to listen to.

&gt; I&#x27;ll have to check out the original file, i only listened to  the one Snow 
&gt; posted. It sounded like it was under water, i heard no  recognizable box 
&gt; sweep. I honestly thought it was a traditional evp  recording, i couldn&#x27;t make 
&gt; out any words in the clip it was just  noise.

&gt; &gt; as you can see  nothing has been done to this file...I don&#x27;t know what 
&gt; snow did to the  part she sent me..I don&#x27;t do anything to my files..I have 
&gt; been told  this is the clearest real time some have ever heard..this is a real  
&gt; post because snow told me something she heard but I didnt...That one  of 
&gt; the reason why don&#x27;t do anything to my files people sometime think  that it 
&gt; messing with quality I agree...but usually i don&#x27;t have to  just maybe amp it 
&gt; and if i find my self having to filter Ill through  it out..this file in 
&gt; many opinion is perfect..
&gt; &gt; Â 
&gt; &gt;  Â 
&gt; &gt; oo also this is from a frank&#x27;s box with live  communication.its also live 
&gt; real time communication...

&gt; &gt; I hear no  communication in this file, but traditional EVP&#x27;s are hard to 
&gt; make out  especially when they are overprocessed like this one.
