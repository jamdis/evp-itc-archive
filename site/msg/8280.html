<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Stefan,

That&#x27;s a great file, i&#x27;m going to do a test session with that today.  
Hopefully i&#x27;ll get some good stuff, how did you have EVPmaker set.  
Such as (overlap, z-cross,x-fade) and the number settings.  I&#x27;m going 
to test out different ones, but was curious of how you set it up.
