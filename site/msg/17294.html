<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>We&#x27;re not trying to silence anything. On the contrary science is always
asking &quot;what if&quot; then it attempts to see if &quot;what if&quot; is in the realm of
possibility.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; At this stage, a lot of paranormal research seems to be in the &quot;hmm...&quot; and
&gt; &quot;what if..?&quot; areas. I like that. It keeps things interesting.
&gt;
&gt; Trying to silence those with data and results to share... to me, that seems
&gt; counterproductive.
&gt;
&gt; Many of my best discoveries were reached by overcoming my own closed-minded
&gt; approach to the research.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m new here, so I&#x27;m very dazzled by what Frank is sharing, and the amount
&gt; of information I&#x27;m seeing in this group&#x27;s Archives. Also, I&#x27;m a little
&gt; chagrined that I&#x27;d previously heard so little about the box, and what I had
&gt; heard... well, it didn&#x27;t encourage me to explore the subject.
&gt;
&gt; But, that&#x27;s my point: Demanding personal proof and/or trying to silence
&gt; speculation, data and results... I&#x27;m not seeing an up side to that kind of
&gt; effort.
&gt;
&gt; Baffled,
&gt; Fiona
