I&#39;ve had better results thus far with the 20-125 than I\nhave the older 12-469.  But, like Steve says, the AM seems to sweep\nslower than the FM on the 20-125.  I have not done a session with the\nFM yet, but will soon.  \n\nJeremy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I just had a Select A Tenna delivered to me in Mexico by a friend. \nUnfortunately this one functions by dialing in the channel you want so\nit isn&#39;t functioning in a way that can be used with a scanning EVP\nsetup.  I think a non dialer is available with the same company and\nthat is what I ordered but I need to go back in a check.  Another $60\ndown.  I hope to use it to get Coast to Coast from San Antonio so it\nisn&#39;t all lost.   \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Jeremy   I listened to your posts and you got some great captures\nthere.  I am encouraged because Mike is sending me a RS 125 for me to\npick up in San Diego next month.  Sounds a lot better than my 469.

Somehow you are supposed to be able to boost your signal\n&gt; without any external device such as a Select-A-Tenna. I need to read\n&gt; into it further. \n&gt; \n&gt; I am very seriously considering buying a Select-A-Tenna.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeremy\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I understand that sun interference would affect the day signal and a\n&gt; big factor is radio stations in the u.s. can boost their signal\n&gt; strength in later hours.

The\n&gt; &gt; &quot;very bored&quot; part, at least if I&#39;m hearing it correctly, proceeds as\n&gt; &gt; soon and the name &quot;Tim&quot; is ending and is at a lot lower decibel level.\n&gt; &gt; Could be one of those things meant for me to hear, as in I was boring\n&gt; &gt; them. It&#39;s any body&#39;s guess.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I got better reception as I did the session at around 8:45pm. \n&gt; &gt; Nighttime seems better for reception around here. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jeremy\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday\n&gt; &gt; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jeremy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hear the &quot; TIM&quot; very clearly but not the &quot; VERY BORED&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tim may be your assigned technition, next session ask for\n&gt; &gt; conformation about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a permanant tech and who Tim is.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@: ecuyler@: Tue, 29 Jan 2008 10:20:26\n&gt; &gt; +0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now that I&#39;ve listened to it some more, I think I hear more stuff,\n&gt; &gt; butI&#39;m not sure what.
