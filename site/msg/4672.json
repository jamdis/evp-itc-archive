It&#39;s possible the repair company wasn&#39;t forthright in thei=\r\nr explanation to me, but they claimed to have cleaned it over a period of s=\r\neveral days hoping to get it to work.  I guess at this point I&#39;m wondering =\r\nif the phone can be transformed into a ghost box (just kidding).  I don&#39;t q=\r\nuite understand why it can&#39;t be repaired anyway--Is it that expensive to ju=\r\nst replace the guts of the thing?  You&#39;re right that the problem is that it=\r\n turns on and then shorts out or drains the battery after a short time.  \n\n=\r\nAnyway, I&#39;ve been studying your videos and radio hack pictures and have to =\r\nsay thanks again!  I think I might actually be able to follow the instructi=\r\nons for a couple of things you describe.  I&#39;ve been learning a lot from you=\r\n already and have only been here a few days!\n\nRobin\n\n\n  ----- Original Mess=\r\nage ----- \n  From: M.A. Coletta (Mike)&lt;mailto:michaelcoletta@...&gt; \n  =\r\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n  Sent: Sunday=\r\n, December 30, 2007 7:05 AM\n  Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: OT ?

Now, water can damage a \n  piece of electronics equipment if the eq=\r\nuipment is on when the water \n  makes contact. The water could act like a c=\r\nonductor and make \n  connections internally where connections would not nor=\r\nmally be made, \n  causing components to go bad because of excess current, v=\r\noltage, etc.\n  But, if a unit is off, water may or may not do damage depend=\r\ning if \n  there is something that can be damaged just by getting wet (like =\r\n\n  speakers, etc.)\n  But, since your unit appears to work, just draining th=\r\ne battery to \n  quickly... I have a very hard time understanding the &quot;water=\r\n damage&quot; \n  thing they told you.\n\n  Since a new battery is doing the same t=\r\nhing as the old, that phone is \n  draining the battery because something, w=\r\nhich uses a lot of current, \n  appears to be on all the time, or something =\r\nis being shorted (or \n  turned on) causing current drain (even if the phone=\r\n appears to be \n  off), while still allowing the phone to function while on=\r\n.\n\n  What that exact problem is can not be guessed from afar though.\n\n  Sor=\r\nry I couldn&#39;t be more specific.
