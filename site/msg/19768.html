&gt;  I know ya think everyone should believe, and I get the Jesus voices, too,
&gt; I just don&#x27;t buy it. The concept of not believing in a savior and being
&gt; either forever dead or condemned to hell just don&#x27;t make any sense. EVP, and
&gt; just about everything paranormal proves that life is forever, no strings
&gt; attached. I don&#x27;t care how much they sugar coat the stuff, it&#x27;s still giving
&gt; your soul, spirit.--freedom, to some unkonwn entity, and that ain&#x27;t good.
&gt; Everyone I know, with out exceptiion the was &quot;born again&quot; became someone
&gt; else, someone evil that would back stab freinds and family for the slightest
&gt; gain. Lie cheat and steal. What about all the really evil, vile
&gt; televangelists out there? Preaching hell&#x27;s fire during the day, chasing
&gt; little boys and doing drugs at night. Try doing some reverse speech on these
&gt; freaks! We have one of those evil clowns right here in Colorado. Why don&#x27;t
&gt; your Jesus keep evil away for these little megolomainiacs? That&#x27;s cuz he is
&gt; that which you fear in the ultimate diguise! Think about it, call the being
&gt; from the white light evil and lure all others into darkness. It&#x27;s not rocket
&gt; science!
&gt;
&gt;  I have to side with Hultay, go make yourself a group just for true
&gt; believers.
&gt;
&gt;  Freedom of religion is by definition freedom from religion!
