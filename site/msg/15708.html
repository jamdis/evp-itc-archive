<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank  Just heard the C2C show and just wanted to tell you I didn&#x27;t get that impression at all about you and Bill coming across as doomsdayers.  Not at all.  Was short, to be true, but I thought you guys came off well.  Ron

&gt;  Well, our show time seems to have been cut short by what I think was
&gt; favoritism by Noory- Murphy and I were not allowed to present anything to
&gt; support what we were saying, and made to look like were doomsday crazy or
&gt; something. No more firggin&#x27; radio shows!
&gt; 
&gt;  Remember what I&#x27;ve said about self proclaimed experts in this field!
