I see things have changed since\n&gt; I been away. Seems more civilized and that&#39;s a good thing. Well juat\n&gt; wanted to tell you all about some EVP&#39;s I got at my place of work. It\n&gt; seems we have a portal to Hell or something in our men&#39;s room LOL. I\n&gt; have gotten quite a few EVP&#39;s(Tradional) in the men&#39;s room. This past\n&gt; few days I got a couple of interesting ones. I was on break from work\n&gt; so I took my DR60 digital recorder and decided to check the room for\n&gt; any spirits. I was in the stall(lol) asking if there were any spirits\n&gt; there with me, when I looked at my recorder and didn&#39;t see it pick up\n&gt; anything(have it on VOR activation)so I decided to go to the sink area.\n&gt; I start asking if there are any spirits here with me and I said Is\n&gt; anyone here? I saw that the recorder was picking up sound. So I played\n&gt; it back and I heard someone say ( mind you I was all alone )&quot; Here\n&gt; comes Lucifer&quot; then after I asked &quot; Is anyone here ? &quot; A weird voice\n&gt; says &quot; There are all kinds of Spirits ... here (here is kind of hard\n&gt; to hear).&quot; So I&#39;m thinking if the first voice said &quot; Here comes\n&gt; Lucifer &quot; the second voice might have been &quot;Lucifer&quot; himself saying of\n&gt; all the Spirits there. It&#39;s a creepy EVP to say the least. So what do\n&gt; you think could it have been Lucifer and could I be picking up a\n&gt; straight line to Hell or what ? Just something to think about. I got\n&gt; goose Bumps just thinking about it. Well anyways that&#39;s what went on.\n&gt; I hope you people are all doing okay. I also think I have taken a\n&gt; picture of a shadow person down in Gettysburg in the Triangular Field\n&gt; this past Nov. I&#39;m still studying it. Hey it&#39;s nice to see everyone\n&gt; getting along that&#39;s great. You all take care and I will let you know\n&gt; of what other things I get in my search for the Paranormal.
