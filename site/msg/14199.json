The scientific method!\n\n      =\r\n  This was a good example of how a couple people, with differing opinions b=\r\nut open minds, can follow an objective methodology to root out the right an=\r\nswer.\n\n        1) Observation.  We heard (indirectly) that someone has seen=\r\n wave files experience lossy compression when sent through email clients.\n\n=\r\n        2) Hypothesis.  The theory is that the email client, and/or email s=\r\nervers, perform lossy compression on their attachments for wave files.\n\n   =\r\n     3) Predictions.  Based on this hypothesis, this should be observable b=\r\ny attaching and sending large waves files through some email servers, and c=\r\nomparing both the originals, and the final files.  If original files and th=\r\ne final files should experience differences in contents.\n\n        4) Experi=\r\nments.  We sent different files, of different sizes, through different clie=\r\nnts and servers.  \n\n        5) Analyze results.  We compared the originals =\r\nat the byte level, and found no loss.\n\n        6) Interpret.  No compressio=\r\nn was observed in our tests, and so no compression is being done with the s=\r\nervers and clients and environments in which we tested.  This does not make=\r\n any claims about other tests or environments, but provides good testing an=\r\nd predictions for what would be expected based on our tests.\n\n        Witho=\r\nut this kind of method, we could have just gone back and forth giving subje=\r\nctive or emotional arguments, with no real evidence.  But following this ki=\r\nnd of method, we get to what we really both wanted: reliable interpretation=\r\n of phenomenon.\n\n        And this doesn&#39;t mean we need to close the books f=\r\norever.  More prediction, more experiments, more results can be tried by mo=\r\nre people, published, and reproduced.  The body of knowledge then grows wid=\r\ner, deeper, and more reliable.\n\n        This is why I push the scientific m=\r\nethod even with EVP studies, even while others continue subjective or emoti=\r\nonal arguments: to improve the study, and to allow progress to be made by a=\r\ns many people as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n        --- On Sun, 5/10/09, April Abercrom=\r\nbie &lt;april@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n          From: April Abe=\r\nrcrombie &lt;april@...&gt;\n          Subject: Re: [EVP-I=\r\nTC] File uploading rules\n          To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n          Da=\r\nte: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 4:23 PM\n\n\n\n          Sweet!

For example, if I had a program in some .exe files, and =\r\nI sent it over email, it could compress it.  But if it lost even one bit, t=\r\nhe resulting exe file would not execute again after it was uncompressed on =\r\nthe other side.\n\n                                This kind of compression d=\r\noes things like looking for common patterns in the file, and replacing them=\r\n with a token.  A rough example would be if it found &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot; in a =\r\nfile 20 times, it could replace all the occurances with say $HN1.  And also=\r\n write a little dictionary in there someplace that says &quot;$HN1=3DHowdy Neigh=\r\nbor&quot;.\n\n                                When the file gets to its destinatio=\r\nn it can be uncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are replaced with &quot;How=\r\ndy Neighbor&quot;.  So it was compressed (instead of 14 characters each, it only=\r\n needed 4, plus the dictionary), but lost no data.\n\n                       =\r\n         Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not lossless.  Depending on t=\r\nhe level of compression, some level of data is lost, and so cannot be recov=\r\nered or reconstructed later.\n\n                                Rick\n\n\n\n     =\r\n                           --- On Sun, 5/10/09, April Abercrombie &lt;april@ab=\r\nercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n                                From=\r\n: April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt;\n                =\r\n                Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n               =\r\n                 To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n                             =\r\n   Date: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 10:26 AM\n\n\n\n                                =\r\nAnother thing:\n\n                                I recently found this out. =\r\nWhen you email a file, if it is not saved as a compressed format, the email=\r\n filtering process will actually compress the file automatically.\n\n        =\r\n                        So even if you have attached a wav. file, it will l=\r\noose resolution over the email process.

Imagine tak=\r\ning a picture of a field of flowers, and beginning to add levels or pixeliz=\r\nation to the picture.  Soon, you would not be able to tell there were flowe=\r\nrs there at all.  You would see a lot of colored blocks.\n\n                 =\r\n               Or in the other direction, imagine you are looking at a comp=\r\netely randomize bunch of pixes on your screen: a complete screen of truely =\r\nrandom static snow.  Pixelizing this, after a while, you would again start =\r\nto see colored blocks.\n\n                                What&#39;s happening is=\r\n that it is processing an area of the image, taking (for instance) the aver=\r\nage value of that entire area, and replacing all the blocks in that area wi=\r\nth the average.  In video processing, this would result in a field of multi=\r\n-colored flowers being replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish bloc=\r\nk, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the noise example, it maybe replace =\r\nall the random pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.  If you did no=\r\nt know beforehand what the original picture was, you couldn&#39;t tell whether =\r\nyour pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a chevy, the sky with c=\r\nlouds, or a random bunch of pixels.\n\n                                It wor=\r\nks the same with the sound files.  Taking something as complex as speech, a=\r\nnd replacing frequencies with their averages, loses the speech the farther =\r\nyou go, until you head strange fluctuating square waves.  Doing the same to=\r\n random static will eventually produce the same thing.

But if the number of bytes are \n                 =\r\n               the same, it tends to indicate the files are \n              =\r\n                  likely the same, but you still need a low level \n        =\r\n                        file comparison to be sure.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My method is \n  =\r\n                              to compare the files using the CMP command in=\r\n \n                                unix.&nbsp;
