<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think the significance of 2012 Mayan calander (long count) has to do with our &quot;galaxy&quot; making ONE complete revolution....on that date (Mmmmm.....my Birthday too) :)  Or was it our Solar System revolving around our Galaxy the &quot;One&quot; revolution----YEP, that was it. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;April Abercrombie&quot; &lt;april@...&gt; wrote:
&gt;
&gt; Does Nostradamus agree with the Mayan calendar about a coming change?
&gt; 
&gt; By Stephen Wagner, July 13, 2009
&gt; 
&gt; On July 10, 2009, The History Channel aired a two-hour documentary on the prophecies of Nostradamus and how they might relate to 2012. It was the latest in a growing heap of information, theories, fears, warnings, enlightenment and anxiety about the year 2012, so perhaps it&#x27;s time I throw in my two cents. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have never put much stock in the supposed Mayan prophecy that 2012 will mark the end of the world, the end of an era or however you want to view it. I mean, haven&#x27;t we been through this countless times? Some predicted May 5, 2000, as doomsday because the planets were in rough alignment. Then there was the hysteria over the millennium and Y2K. And of course various religious cults have named date after date when the world would surely end, all of which came and went without so much as a hiccup. 
&gt; 
&gt; The year 2012 will be no different. Yes, the subject is selling a lot of books, drawing large audiences for talk radio and counting up lots of hits on websites, but I think that&#x27;s the most drama we&#x27;ll get out of 2012. It, too, will come and go without a major shift on the planet. Don&#x27;t we all really know that? 
&gt; 
&gt; Those promoting the 2012 changes have thrown out a wide range of possibilities for what might happen - everything from a literal end of the world, to dramatic social, economic, political and climatic upheaval, to a &quot;spiritual awakening,&quot; which, of course, could mean almost anything.
&gt; 
&gt; Why 2012?
&gt; 
&gt; And what is it based on? Primarily, it&#x27;s based on an ancient Mayan &quot;long count&quot; calendar, carved on stone, which according to calculations ends on December 21, 2012 and marks the end of a 5,126-year era. Without a doubt, the ancient Mayans were remarkable mathematicians and astronomers, but can we really take this &quot;prophecy&quot; seriously? First of all, it&#x27;s not even a prophecy. It happens to be when their long count calendar ends. Why should that hold any significance for us? 
&gt; 
&gt; The second reason proponents of this coming apocalypse say it is on its way is that in 2012 there will be an alignment of sorts with the center of our galaxy. Because the Earth wobbles slowly as it rotates (once about every 26,000 years) the sun will appear to rise in alignment with the center of the Milky Way. Interesting, yes, but there seems to be no cosmological evidence of any kind that this should have an effect on our planet, physically, socially or even spiritually. 
&gt; 
&gt; The third reason touted is that the sun is scheduled to be at a &quot;solar maximum&quot; in that year, a time when sun spots and solar flares are very active. This kind of activity really can cause problems. Such activity can disable and damage satellites and can have a dramatic effect on the Earth&#x27;s weather. The schedule is based on past patterns of such activity, but we have no way of knowing whether it will happen in 2012, and if it does how severe it might be. 
&gt; 
&gt; Strained Interpretations
&gt; 
&gt; Back to the Nostradamus documentary for a moment. As usual, the Nostradamus experts quoted a selection of his quatrains - those that feature famine, pestilence, war, etc. - and strained to tie them into 2012. Not successfully, in my opinion. The world has always been plagued with famine, pestilence, war and the rest of it, and I saw no quatrain that even remotely indicated that what Nostradamus was talking about was the year 2012.
&gt; 
&gt; Aside from the quatrains, the documentary focused mainly on the so-called &quot;Lost Book of Nostradamus,&quot; which was discovered in a modern library in Rome in 1994. Dating to 1629, the manuscript, filled the bright watercolor drawings, is titled Nostradamus Vatinicia Code and has on the inside the name Michel de Notredame as the author. First of all, although this &quot;lost book&quot; is thought by some to be the work of Nostradamus, there is no definitive proof or scholarly consensus that he was actually the author; some experts have serious doubts. So to make this book the platform for this documentary puts it on very shaky ground. 
&gt; 
&gt; And then the lengths to which the talking heads on the show reached and strained to connect the drawings to 2012 was positively ludicrous. For example, the drawing of a sword, held pointing up and around which is looped a banner or scroll (see illustration above) - this was interpreted as the sun&#x27;s alignment with the galactic center in 2012. Really? The other drawings were likewise twisted and mangled to fit the interpretations needed for the argument. We all know that we can take such enigmatic drawings - and quatrains - and interpret them to fit virtually any scenario that we want. 
&gt; 
&gt; So What Will Happen?
&gt; 
&gt; Why are some people obsessed with 2012 (apart from its marketing aspects)? Why are they obsessed with apocalypse and the end of the world? Why is it always seen as right around the corner? 
&gt; 
&gt; I think the answer is that we both fear and want great change. As wonderful as the world can be, it is, as noted earlier, continually plagued by war, economic difficulties, famine and climate shifts. This stuff is not new. They are continuing problems that ebb and flow on the planet. While we fear that it&#x27;s going to get worse (and it certainly can get worse), at the same time we have the hope that it&#x27;s going to get better. We fear the catastrophes of an apocalypse, yet we hope for that spiritual awakening that will save us from our own human nature. 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m no Nostradamus, but here&#x27;s my prediction for 2012: the world will continue on pretty much as it has in the past. There will be dire problems and there will be great joys. Perhaps some problems will get a bit worse than they are right now, but there will be no earth-shattering catastrophe. If there is a spiritual awakening, it won&#x27;t be on a planetary or mass scale through some unspecified miracle, as some hope, it will be as individuals. (But that has nothing to do with 2012.) The best we can shoot for is that as individuals we do our best to make our own small fragments of the Earth better places. This has always been the case and ever shall be.
