Looking forward to seeing your website.\n&gt; \n&gt; Alex\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Guy&quot; &lt;yzzzguy@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In regards to the Spiricom story - I have to assume you&#39;re \n&gt; referring to \n&gt; &gt; the Mark IV model as diagrammed/written up in the Spiricom manual \n&gt; (as \n&gt; &gt; opposed to the INCORRECT diagram made by Polish researcher \nWojciech \n&gt; &gt; Drewniak...http://www.worlditc.org/k_06_spiricom.htm ).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; While my research is still not finished (and I&#39;ve been working on \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; for a little over 2 years), I&#39;m leaning toward the Mark IV \n&gt; &gt; conversations as having been hoaxed by Bill O&#39;Neil. HOWEVER - I \n&gt; believe \n&gt; &gt; he acted alone and that none of the other members of the \n&gt; Metascience \n&gt; &gt; Foundation were involved with this hoax. As to O&#39;Neil&#39;s \nmotivation \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; the hoax - I still don&#39;t know. But I will also say that the \n&gt; veridical \n&gt; &gt; evidence that O&#39;Neil claims to have received about Dr. George J. \n&gt; &gt; Mueller through clairaudience is amazing and it is tough to see \nhow \n&gt; &gt; O&#39;Neil would have gotten this information given his finances, \n&gt; location, \n&gt; &gt; the timeframe, etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been promising to get my personal website up and operating \nfor \n&gt; &gt; some time now but have been busy. Hopefully soon. Then I&#39;ll start \n&gt; &gt; posting what I have found out so far.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Guy Jackson\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; P.S. The recordings of the Spiricom cassette that can be found at \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; GOS website ( http://www.ghostpix.com/spiricom/spiricom.html ) \nare \n&gt; very \n&gt; &gt; poor. Scott L over at Ghostly Talk pulled much a much cleaner \n&gt; version \n&gt; &gt; directly from a source cassette provided to him by Mark Macy ( \nsee \n&gt; &gt; Ghostly Talk show archive noted as a &quot;Bonus&quot; and &quot;Repost&quot; for \n&gt; August \n&gt; &gt; 22, 2006: http://www.ghostlytalk.com/node/616 ). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;alexrondini&quot; &lt;alexrondini@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new on this group.
