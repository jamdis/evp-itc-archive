I dont know of any specific alter=
natives to the Panasonics.
Ive got a QR100 and 200, but I did buy an Olympu=
s DS-40 a while back. Not as good as the QR's but it does get evps.
A guide=
line I can suggest is to look for older recorders that dont have USB (earph=
one jack only, like the QR's). The older recorders are more likely to have =
codecs that are less efficient at conversion, subsequently generate artifac=
ts, and therefore more likely to be better at evp.
Good luck Urs.
