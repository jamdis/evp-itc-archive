The amount of heat produced inside \n&gt;    &gt; the planet is nearly equal to the total _solar radiation_ \n&gt;    &gt; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation)  it  receives._[29]_ \n&gt;    &gt; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter#cite_note-elkins-tanton-28)   This additional heat radiation is \n&gt;    &gt; generated by the _Kelvin-Helmholtz  mechanism_ \n&gt;    &gt; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin-Helmholtz_mechanism)  through _adiabatic_ \n&gt;    &gt; (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_process)  contraction.
