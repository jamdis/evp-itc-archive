A simpler e=
xplanation is that, when listening to ambiguous audio, you tend to interpre=
t the noise in the context of your current state of mind. It is a simpler e=
xplanation to explain hearing a difference in ambiguous audio from week to =
week under that assumption, than to attribute the change to spirit activity=
 in the electronics or on the media.


Seems to me.
