You don't have to name names.. I remember!  Are they really demonic?  Do yo=

  Thank y=

  because now =
I know it's REAL, I'm not crazy, and it isn't my

aptured on a digital voice recorder while I

crowave oven nearby, and I felt that the

  It may be important to note that I=
 had just invited spirits inside 
  the house from outside, and that after =
I listened to this message I 
  told them to go back outside because they w=
ere too rude to continue 
  talking to. I've tried to replicate this experi=
ment a number of 
  times since then (without the verbal invitation into my=
 home) and 
  have had no luck whatsoever.

ateBUT!The reason I 
  came up with this whole protection ritual was that s=
ome of the new 
  researchers whereexpressing a rational concern for negati=
ve responces 
  that they were recieving through thier boxes.The short prot=
ection 
  ritual that I posted is not meant to quell irrational histerical =

  fear, and I agreewith rosemary that anyone suffering from such fear 
  s=
hould rethink thier involment in the paranormal research field.that 
  bein=
g said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal comfort to 
  those new=
 individuals that had never expperienced spiritual 
  negativity. And to he=
lp ease them into aproaching a session 
  eventually with confidenceand det=
ermination as well as full 
  curiousity for all types of the communication=
 we recieve.My initial 
  post of the ritual file was done with the best of=
 intentions and 
  meant to be another tool available for those who felt th=
ey needed or 
  wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer ritual,=
 I don't 
  think it is really worthy of all this debate.Use it, don't use =
it. 
  It's there if you want it. Also I must say there are two kinds of 
 =
 fear the kind that is natural and a god given emotion for self 
  preserva=
tion, ie the fright and flight reflex that is an instinctive 
  trait in al=
l of us. Then you have the irrational dibilitating phobic 
  fear that can =
turn an individual into a frozen statue. That type of 
  fear I believe is =
unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt with and 
  learned how to harne=
ss. I also believe that anyone that harbors that 
  type of fear would not =
be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a 
  case of such fear it would al=
ready be present and doing a small 
  protection ritual would not fuel it a=
ny further. So lets take it for 
  what it is, something to utilize in our =
box of tools like an emf
