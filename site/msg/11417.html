<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s been my expereince that you need to supply something for the 
entities to form voices out of, doesn&#x27;t matter how you do it, they 
will use what you use. I use radio a convinient source of this raw 
audio, that&#x27;s the only reason I use radio tuners. It&#x27;s possible some 
of the vocies come in on an RF carrier, but I can&#x27;t tell.

&gt; Spelling corrections, information corrections... Thanks for the 
edit
&gt; and for the information. I&#x27;ll make sure before I post again that I
&gt; have all the information straight. Not here to argue or anything 
as a
&gt; matter of fact I want to thank you for giving me the facts as they
&gt; should be. It&#x27;s been a while since I actually read anything from 
WITC. 
&gt; 
&gt; As I said, I was searching out ways to bring all the devices and 
their
&gt; uses into one unit. It might help prove that the phenomena is real 
if
&gt; I could get multiple confirmations on one unit. Of course you can
&gt; always just use many units at once and get the same effect. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the info.

&gt; &gt; There is NO research anywhere which shows that germanium diodes 
are 
&gt; &gt; superior to silicon diodes as far as the &quot;diode method&quot; is 
concerned.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Konstantin Raudive didn&#x27;t pioneer the &quot;diode method&quot; (sorry - 
exactly 
&gt; &gt; who did escapes me for the moment). I have a copy 
of &quot;Breakthrough&quot; 
&gt; &gt; which is the only English translation of any of Raudive&#x27;s books 
and 
&gt; &gt; the &quot;diode method&quot; is described in an appendix. The diagram in 
the 
&gt; &gt; appendix note shown there (and I can scan in the page in the 
book and 
&gt; &gt; post here, if anyone likes) shows a typical 1N914 diode which 
uses 
&gt; &gt; silicon as the base semiconductor.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The only &quot;transcommunication device&quot; I&#x27;m aware of that 
specifically 
&gt; &gt; called out for the use of germanium was the one diagrammed by 
the 
&gt; &gt; spirits in one of the Scole Experiments (and even then - it was 
a 
&gt; &gt; block of this material - not a component diode).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; By the way - it was &quot;Konstantin Raudive&quot; (with a &quot;k&quot;), &quot;Franz 
Seidl&quot; 
&gt; &gt; (not Seidle...See Jean de Muelder&#x27;s website for original 
diagrams of 
&gt; &gt; the Psychofon from Seidl&#x27;s book 
&gt; &gt; http://jeandemeulder.transcommunicatie.nl/psychophone2.htm) 
&gt; &gt; and &quot;George Meek&quot; (no &quot;s&quot;). Additionally - George Meek&#x27;s 
Metascience 
&gt; &gt; Foundation developed at least 5 different models of the Spiricom 
&gt; &gt; (most people are only familiar with Bill O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s Mark IV).

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure RetroCom,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; According to WORLDITC there are many different devices using 
&gt; &gt; different
&gt; &gt; &gt; aspects of the radio and white-noise spectrum. Constantine 
Raudive
&gt; &gt; &gt; used germanium diodes to capture EVPs. Siedle built his 
psychophone,
&gt; &gt; &gt; George Meeks had the Spiricom tone device. Now you have the 
diode 
&gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt; &gt; white noise, radio wave HF static, and a tone device. I am 
&gt; &gt; attempting
&gt; &gt; &gt; to build an all in one audio recording and communication 
device. I 
&gt; &gt; am
&gt; &gt; &gt; doing this to see if by having a combined unit you can get 
contact
&gt; &gt; &gt; with either one or the other or perhaps multiple contacts at 
one 
&gt; &gt; time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is my first post. I was wondering if anyone had created 
an 
&gt; &gt; all in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one ITC EVP device. I know that researchers such as Seidle 
had 
&gt; &gt; created
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the psychophone that seemed to cover many aspects of ITC but 
I 
&gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yet to see all ways of communication in one device.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have created an all in one design that covers most of the 
&gt; &gt; devices
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used. If you wish I will share the design.
