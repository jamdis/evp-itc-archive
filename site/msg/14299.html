It's amazing how these people that die, stay around in the same place they  
died, one would think they would be free of the sick physical body, go  
exploring, or look for loved ones, why do they want to hang around an empty old 
 building?

One of the most fascinating ones I ever got was recorded in the ruins  of a 
former mental hospital. The building is shaped like an "H" and  our group 
of about 10 people was standing in one arm of the "H" looking  through the 
windows to the opposite arm. We saw a shadow moving around inside  the 
building in the other arm. We were just discussing this when a hoarse  voice came 
in THREE times on the recording and said "It's Harold Wing."  This voice was 
not audible to our ears at the time of the  investigation.

Later on, one of the members of our group was able to access old records  
for the mental hospital and found there was indeed a patient named Harold  
Wing who died there of typhoid fever in 1936. There is no way any of us  
could've known that at the time and it's doubtful anyone living would've known  
about it at the time, either.

Playing acrh skeptic, what value is a voice for survival evidence if  you 
don't know who it is? How do you know where it came from? Or can say  beyond 
doubt that it's even "paranormal"? People have millions of these  voices by 
now.

have captured some brilliant evidence for survival.The first voice i  
captured was that of a little boy saying ''hello''at 1.30 am.It was so  clear 
that others could agree on and the voice could be still heard some  fifteen 
feet away from the recorder.I have captured other voices too, just  as 
impressive.UnfortunI have been experimenting with EVP for about a year now (in my
