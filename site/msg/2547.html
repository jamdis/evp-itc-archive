&gt; Hello Everyone... My name is April Slaughter and I am so happy to 
be 
&gt; a part of this group. Thank you for allowing me to join! 
&gt; 
&gt; Paranormal phenomena and I are no strangers to one another. It has 
&gt; always been an intrinsic part of my life as far back as I can 
&gt; remember, so what is considered to be out of the ordinary for most 
&gt; people is actually a pretty normal way of life for me. 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m an investigator with quite a bit of experience behind me in the 
&gt; field. Years ago, I was under the assumption that EVP happened 
around 
&gt; everyone, and could be easily captured by any individual attempting 
&gt; to collect it. But I have come to find that many people find it to 
be 
&gt; just as elusive as our crypto friend Bigfoot. For one reason or 
&gt; another, it has never been difficult for me to obtain it in most 
any 
&gt; situation or location. I will post examples of what I have 
collected 
&gt; over the years if you are interested in hearing them.
&gt; 
&gt; I have had the privilege of spending some time with 3 boxes, built 
by 
&gt; Frank... and I am always so intrigued by it. 
&gt; 
&gt; I look forward to getting to know you all!
&gt; 
&gt; ~April
