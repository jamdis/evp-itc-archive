Hi Stefan   I used your file.  I just checked the original you sent and there is a beep in the front which probably gets duplicated in EVP maker.  Need to figure out a way to eliminate.  
   
  One question for you.  Have you found newbees like me can do many sessions without results?  I have done possibly 12 to 15 sessions.  Ziltch!  Nada!  I trust the process but it ain't paying off yet.  Gotta make something happen.  I do appreciate your help.  Ron L

          Hi Ron,

what file did you use as the sound source for EVPmaker? I hear beeps in
your recording that aren't part of the original allophones file I made.
The recording is also very loud and sounds distorted, and you didn't
seem to have used the internal cue list of the file (if it was the
original SJ-Allophones.wav file).

Stefan
