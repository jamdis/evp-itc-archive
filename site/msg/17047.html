<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Pareidolia is not psuedo science. It is an actual, proven, natural
functioning of the brain.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia

Please read this article, and more, if you have any questions about it being
psuedo science. I chose the Wikipedia version because I thought it would be
the least offensive to you. Other articles specifically called out EVP and
other things.

For the record, I don&#x27;t think all EVP&#x27;s are due to pareidolia.

&gt;  It was implied that all this stuff is &quot;Pareidolia&quot;, and because you could
&gt; put a name on it that somehow meant it was all explanined. I&#x27;ve been hearing
&gt; this pseudo scientific BS for 10 years, so I&#x27;m a bit touchy. Science
&gt; explains the paranormal away, and yet people continune to photograph images,
&gt; and get their names, and the names of deseased loved ones through EVP, as
&gt; well as questions answered, and science(althogh not all scientists) just
&gt; ignores these inconvinient facts and focuses on that we might see things
&gt; that are not there, which I disagree with as well.
&gt;
&gt;  Did you even bother looking at the image on the group home page. That was
&gt; from sweeping a TV tuner with a random voltage and video recording the
&gt; monitor screen. So explain away why there is a wolf image embedded in the
&gt; guy&#x27;s hat, an image of an alien below his ear, and why in God&#x27;s name does he
&gt; resembles the classic description of an MIB or Shadow Person?  Pareidolia no
&gt; doubt!

&gt;&gt;   I&#x27;m not sure who you&#x27;re talking to about &quot;holier than thou&quot;.  But, you
&gt;&gt; are the one who keeps dismissing any question about results and testing with
&gt;&gt; phrases like &quot;Bite Me&quot;. I don&#x27;t see anyone else doing that, and I certainly
&gt;&gt; never have.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I agree trying new things is good.  And discussing results.  And looking
&gt;&gt; for new directions.   So I&#x27;m still not sure who you are upset with.  Perhaps
&gt;&gt; you could be more specific: quote what you have found objectionable, and let
&gt;&gt; us know why?
