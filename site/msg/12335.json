I \n&gt; was wondering though, if anyone has used this modded radio regularly \n&gt; and can give opinions on it&#39;s performance stacked up against a 12-\n469 -\n&gt; 470 or 20-125. Looks like a more robust design, and that tuner knob \n&gt; looks like a great candidate for manual tuning as well. Any thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; Andy\n&gt;"}
