I live in S. GA. I&#39;m a\nwife, mother of one, artist (photographer, and professional\nsoap-artisan). I&#39;ve had a life long interest in the\nsupernatural/paranormal/occult. I&#39;ve looked into joining a few local\nparanormal groups which have sprung up this year, but thus far haven&#39;t\nentered membership level with either. Soooo, instead of just being\nstagnant and doing nothing, I&#39;m interested in putting together more\nequipment/&quot;know-how&quot; from a techie standpoint of view for doing my own\ninvestigations with family and close friends. (Pretty much all members\nof my family are interested in this sort of phenomenon.) I have a very\ntechno-knowledgeable husband who could pretty much put together\nwhatever equipment we need. Of course, being that we&#39;re pretty much a\none income family, the more we can build ourselves, lowering the cost,\nthe better. ;)\n\nI have lots of side interests, background, etc. but that sorta covers\nwhere I&#39;m coming from.\n\nAnd yes, I&#39;m finding all this information (out &quot;there&quot;) so over\nwhelming!  Trying to figure out the right place to start. I do plan on\nhaving my techie-hubby check out Frank&#39;s schematics, because I do hear\nover and over that his box is still &quot;da&#39;bomb.&quot;  :D\n\nThanks!\n\nBecca"}
