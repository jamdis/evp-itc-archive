I \njust ordered some new chips last night so I can add FM as an additional \nsound source.\n\nThere&#39;s a lot of darkside interaction, and if you start getting a workable \nsystem up and running you get those voices that try to either scare you off, \nor distract you from the real stuff. The darkheads don&#39;t want this stuff to \nwork, preferring humans stay in fear, and fear of death is the most powerful \nfear to have. The manipulations can be very subtle. I don&#39;t want to get \ndistracted on other systems till I have a PCB made, and a production system \nout there.\nI have an idea for a Spiricom like device using audio tones, instead of \nusing radio as a sound source, I think I can adapt my system to it,  using \nthe random vlotage gnerator to sweep an audio VCO using the Intersil 8038 \nchip.  This voice was using a tone generator I had built into one of the \nreceivers years ago, and mixed it with the radio noise.You can hear the 1000 \nhz sqaurewave tone in the background.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nPlay Flexicon: the crossword game that feeds your brain.
