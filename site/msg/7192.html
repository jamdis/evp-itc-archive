&gt; I hear all the pieces, too, Frank, and they do seem to be related.  
&gt; But the message isn&#x27;t clear enough to really understand. I&#x27;m 
racking  
&gt; my brain trying to recall something I told you that might shed 
some  
&gt; light--wait--it says that I told *them.*
&gt; 
&gt; My inclination is that this has something to do with Debbie at www. 
&gt; 1800heaven.com. She got into this because of grief over the loss 
of  
&gt; her son, Joey, and recently she has been experimenting with a 
minibox  
&gt; for the first time.

into  
&gt; &gt; the rythum of the recording, and mentally seperate out the 
gibberish.
