 Tuner with white noise running. There's a little noise pick up, but I had=
 the antenna wire runing very close to the RVG section.  Afterward I replac=
ed the antenna wire with coax to prevent noise pick up from inside the box.=
 Oh yeah, manual tuing. 
 
 I know! There's noisy crappy boxes out there, a=
nd I should have done this testing long ago, but so many wanted to be like =
Chris Moon, and I wanted to get the boxes out there so others could experie=
nce it, and experiment, but they function so poorly as yet, and no one gets=
 anything close to what I do, or what Moon claims. So the TAPS article was =
correct about the things being flawed, but I'm working on it. I don't sell =
the stuff, and never have, so all we've lost is time. I can't make many of =
these, I can handle making them to test, and improve the thing, but I dread=
 just having to wire and wire and build and build endlessly. I can't do tha=
t stuff anymore, just too brain fried. 
 
 The fact is, there are other met=
hods that work as well, and probably better. Often the voices are much clea=
rer with the simple methods, and they can be shared since most can hear the=
m. I am endlessly discouraged when I think I have a perfectly clear voice f=
rom the box, and not another person in the world can hear it.
