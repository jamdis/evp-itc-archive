Remember one thing, we are the light in the darkness!  There will always be people that will try to rain on OUR parade.  We have to be the voice of reason so WE can move forward.  This is not about us!  Its about TRUTH and the light and research.  Thanks for everything you have done and continue to do!!\n  I think personally that these devices work best when the user is not using the device for personal gain, but for everyones best intrests!!\n   \n  Happy New Year!\n\nFrank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n          I don&#39;t know if maybe the audio pick up from the box wasn&#39;t very good, \nbut I can&#39;t make out much of that either.
