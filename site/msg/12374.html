<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rhonda,

Have played it in reverse and at different speeds. Playing it in 
reverse actually helped convince me that it was an EVP. It clearly 
sounds like words being played backwards. Can&#x27;t tell what it says 
forward or reverse though.

Thanks for taking the time to listen to it.

&gt; Wow thats an odd one, can hear that someone/thing is trying to 
communicate but no clue what the voice is saying...really wasnt all 
that creepy to me...just seemed like they were having a hard time 
making comms clear with what they had to work with...have you tried 
playing it backwards or slower/faster speeds?

&gt; &gt; Hi Patrick,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The recorder was sitting on a nightstand near a set of bunkbeds in 
a 
&gt; &gt; child&#x27;s room.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks for taking the time to check it out. Let me know what you 
&gt; &gt; think.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Rob

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am new to the group and have an EVP I want an opinion on. 
The 
&gt; &gt; file is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; posted on the folder ROB STONE&#x27;S FILES. Not sure what the 
&gt; &quot;voice&quot; 
&gt; &gt; is.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If anyone has time to take a listen I would greatly appreciate 
&gt; it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for your help.
