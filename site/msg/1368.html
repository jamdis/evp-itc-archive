&gt; One of your fellow countrymen (Lance Reed) came up with a great 
method
&gt; called the light feedback method that has really shown a lot of
&gt; promise. He has posted some examples and the setup over on the
&gt; ITCBridge Forum.

&gt; Take a look, he has done a great job.

&gt; &gt; A big hello to everyone,
&gt; &gt; I am the founder of the circle uk evp group
&gt; &gt; I have been recording Evp and capturing images for awhile now
&gt; &gt; Mind you i seem now to be hitting a blank wall with my images 
these 
&gt; &gt; past few months as i am working on a transparent method in the 
loop
&gt; &gt; Frustration can be an understatment on bad days,lol.
&gt; &gt; So i thought i would get a wee bit of advice on these other 
techniques 
&gt; &gt; people are now using,I also work with water and results there 
seem to 
&gt; &gt; be getting on fine.
&gt; &gt; I am not very techie minded although i try:-)
&gt; &gt; On the Evp side of things i have no problems as i get good/bad 
days 
&gt; &gt; like anyone else.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   Take Care
&gt; &gt;   Cat:-)
