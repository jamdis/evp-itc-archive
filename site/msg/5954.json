Put the fricking  \nradio down and go get another hobby. Leave it to those of us who  \naren&#39;t afraid and don&#39;t care if someone calls us a bitch or a slut  \nand tries to pawn themselves off as Bazoozoo.\n\nJust. Stop. Listening. And.

The layers of voices are, in many cases, multiple. Often, the\n&gt; listener hears very little of what is actually said. The voices can be\n&gt; mocking or downright crude. I have not yet formed an opinion fully but\n&gt; it would seem to me that these models are easy devices for lower level\n&gt; entities to figure out how to use. I can not speak of the attitudes or\n&gt; fears of those investigators present although at times, their voices\n&gt; are a bit shaky.\n&gt;\n&gt; Babs\n&gt;\n\n\nOh dea .
