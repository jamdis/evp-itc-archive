<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>What you are describing is known in audio engineering as 
 beam-directed ultrasonic demodulation. The principle has been well
 described over the years and was in fact mentioned at a recent
 conference in Finland in 2008. The technology is most commonly 
 applied to parametric loudspeaker arrays typical of Audio Spotlight.

 Audio signals are modulated selectively onto an ultrasonic carrier 
 which tends to be in the 10 to 20 KHz region. This is explained by  
 simple physics and seems to have to do with the way in which bone  
 conductance occurs in humans.

 So it is possible for humans to hear in the range well above 20
 KHz. Studies of brains of animals well-known for their ultrasonic
 abilities confirm the neurotopology involved.

 Now as to the possibility that this same thinking can be applied to
 some form of vibrational transformation. As I say often &quot;anything
 is possible, it&#x27;s just a matter of probability&quot;. So how probable is
 what is proposed? It seems that such things could indeed happen.
 But is this necessary? 

 Many people including myself have suggested for many years that a
 probable source of disembodied voices may be psychokinesis. 
 In other words the phenomena is actually self-produced and often  
 self-directed. 

 Just a little while ago I got off the phone with a colleague on the
 West coast who is well known in the parapsychology community. He
 was telling me of a case over 20 years ago where a man&#x27;s voice was
 heard on an audio recording made when the man and my colleague were
 standing not a few feet apart. Even though the man was not
 physically speaking, his speech was clearly heard on the tape. 
 Even the speech style was clearly audible and consistent with his
 penchant for swearing. This was not in the noise; this would be
 classified as a Class A EVP. And it was not heard at the time of
 the recording, so it is an EVP as defined by this group.

 Given this, I think the more probable explanation is that what is
 occurring at least some of the time is PK in fact and likely not
 discarnate communications. I am not saying it never happens, just
 positing an interesting alternative explanation which has a basis
 in factual observation of very high quality in a site that has been
 well-documented even on recent television programs in Los Angeles
 as having paranormal disturbances which go back many decades.

&gt; Interesting find, though not completely surprising. This very well could be an explanation for why two people in close proximity perceive different things. It can also be explained by simply not focusing ones attention or having a persons expectations manifest via personal perception.
&gt;  
&gt; I did a little research a while ago on using an ultrasounic, non-linear acoustic signal as a carrier wave for audible sound. What happens with this phenomena is an audible signal is embedded and transmitted through the air and is calculated to demodulate at certain points in three dimensional space. In other words we could transmit sound that is inaudible to anyone else around and have it manifest in a 3D bubble where ever we wanted. A person standing only 2 feet away could not hear the music or speech that the person in the beam could.
&gt;  
&gt; If for some reason you believe it impossible take a look at the work of Dr. Joseph Pompeii. He use to work for Bose and since received his PhD from MIT in aucoustics. He invented and owns exclusive rights to what he calls the audio spotlight (google it). 
&gt;  
&gt; Now, I said all that to say this...if it is possible to do this with sound of a low vibration riding energy of a higher vibration then could it also be possbile for a entity of a higher vibration demodulating to a lower vibration and manifesting physically. All things in the universe consist of energic vibrations oscillating at different rates and at different vectors, even what we perceive as solid! Is this possible, if not why?

&gt; Thought these comments might be interesting in light of recent
&gt; threads. Dr. Sam El-Khazen recently published an article in the
&gt; Journal of Neuroquantology (study of brain function at the quantum
&gt; mechanical level). In this paper entitled &quot;DNA The Gateway to
&gt; Time&quot;, El-Khazen talks about the relationship between the structure
&gt; of DNA, time, conscious perception and gravity. There is credible
&gt; evidence that these are intimately correlated. 
&gt; 
&gt; An important finding for this group has to do with how we may in
&gt; fact detect external influences in the physical world. If El-Khazen
&gt; has it right, two EM waves must align in order for the preception
&gt; process to even begin. If this does not happen, there is nothing to
&gt; perceive, even though we may be impacted by an external potentially
&gt; influencing EM wave. The second wave is generated from borrowed
&gt; energy within our brain cells and is modelled upon the structure of
&gt; DNA strands. So yes we are impacted by billions of EM signals per
&gt; second but we actually detect only a small portion of these that we
&gt; later process in the late-stage perceptual processes. 
&gt; 
&gt; This would nicely explain why two people would perceive events
&gt; differently despite the fact that they were literally side by side
&gt; witnessing the same event. Again this is strictly a matter of
&gt; random probability, it seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with
&gt; volition or intention. That is more the focus of the later
&gt; perceptual processing which is in turn dependent upon this
&gt; probabilistic process.
&gt; 
&gt; This could also explain why it is that EVP and ITC signals are
&gt; perceived differently by different people even when no physical
&gt; alteration to the media has occurred and why different things are
&gt; heard more easily at different times by the same person.
