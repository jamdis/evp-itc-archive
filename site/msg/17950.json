Around here they think anyone that has a tip must be a suspect.\n\nI apologize. I saw that so many people addressed you as &quot;Snow&quot; that I thought it was fine with you. It was not meant as a slight or disrespect in any way. Please address me as &quot;Draiga&quot; not &quot;Dra&quot;.\n\nThank you,\n~Draiga\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@...m, SnowfireL@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thank you Dra, I still have many other&#39;s I did it on the first day the Annie became missing, I called police on the second day they found her body about 8 or 9 days later in a wall at the science tech area of the school, I let the police hear all my files, but of course police thought I was in some bar and all the people were talking about the missing girl.  The cop on the line said, &quot;well, it&#39;s only been one day, and we hope we find her alive.&quot;  Just what he said, so I did feel badly because spirit told them she was already dead.  I&#39;m glad i saved all the files, i have even the originals too. that was before i knew how to change them to mp so they are still in wav format.  This is the real thing people, and it&#39;s not only Coke either! sf\n&gt; \n&gt;"}
