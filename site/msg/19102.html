<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I do one recorded session a week for 6-8 minutes.  I usually do longer sessions during the week, but i don&#x27;t record them.  If i do, i will feel obligated to go over it.

&gt; I think Frank said it best when he said it gets tedious with longer
&gt; sessions.  As you do more sessions, you will want to continue conversing
&gt; with the Others for as long as possible.  But, upon playback, careful
&gt; analysis (with headphones and Adobe Audition) takes me an hour for every 5
&gt; minutes.  So three sessions a week at 15 minutes a session can eat up a lot
&gt; of time.  So I try to keep my home sessions to 10 minutes or less.  There
&gt; are times when they are not too communicative and I keep pressing on past 15
&gt; minutes and I always dread it when I do because there is so much more to
&gt; listen to.
&gt; 
&gt; In the field, it is a different story.  Session times can go from 15 to 40
&gt; minutes and leave you with a helluva lot of audio to consider.  Being very
&gt; active in investigations and home sessions can make going over the audio a
&gt; very dreadful process if you inundate yourself with longer sessions.
&gt; 
&gt; So my advice?  Keep it under ten unless you are getting something fantastic.
&gt;  Also, keep a word file on every session file that documents the time and
&gt; communication received in the session for future reference.  Sometimes
&gt; people and messages come across that I got over a year ago and I would have
&gt; never known it if it weren&#x27;t for the files I keep.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps.

&gt; &gt; I would go at least 10 to 15 minutes, but that&#x27;s just in my own experience,
&gt; &gt; which is not very extensive. What do some others on here have to say? I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; actually curious about this question myself.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have recently started doing EVP Maker sessions in my home and have
&gt; &gt; gotten results (Rudy&#x27;s Folder) from two of the first four sessions. I have
&gt; &gt; only been doing five minute sessions at a time. Is this too long or too
&gt; &gt; short of a session time?
