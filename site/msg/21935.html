&gt; This is an EVP Maker recording done August 25, 2011 at 4:45 p.m. You have to
&gt; play this at about 1.5% of the normal speed to hear it properly. Listed
&gt; below is what I think I hear, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I think I&#x27;m right.
&gt; It&#x27;s just a guide. Comments are always welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; There are some interesting things here about Elenin, perhaps. It sounds
&gt; almost like there are to males talking to each other at times. I have a
&gt; second part to this audio, which I will post tomorrow.
