&gt; guys&#x27;. So which is it, false communication, which is no  
&gt; commnunication, or is it evil spirits. To make it worse, this idiot  
&gt; implies he has the backing of the -------, and the church believes  
&gt; we are letting evil into the world.
&gt;
&gt;  I took this as a severe slap to the face, very insulting to me,  
&gt; and every paranormal researcher in the world. He claims the &#x27;real  
&gt; voices&#x27; he gets are made out of white noise combined with broadcast  
&gt; fragments. Duffus!! That is exactly the kind of voices the living  
&gt; mind creates to get the voices it wants to hear. Yet only his are  
&gt; the real voices! My old friend, you can take your &#x27;serious session&#x27;  
&gt; and your bishop, and shove &#x27;em.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  My apoplogies to the group, but I know this will get forwarded,  
&gt; and this bozo finds me so easy to dismiss, that normal e-mail would  
&gt; be useless.
&gt;
&gt;  I had to cut some out for nice sakes.
