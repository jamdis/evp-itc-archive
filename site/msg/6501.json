If i actually have more than \n\na couple files from here on out, i will be attaching them to an e-\n\nmail and not the board to save space here.  And also, if people do \n\npost files maybe we can all just have one post that says we have \n\nuploaded files to our folder instead of 30 audio announcements in a \n\nrow that just seems to waste a lot of e-mail space in the individual \n\ne-mails.

Space is limited here and you are \n\nall \n\n&gt; nearing the 100% mark so try to keep your section under 5 megs. If \n\n&gt; you need more space use www.esnips.com and you can store 50 gigs to \n\n&gt; share with the group or public.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; I think it is great you guys have so much to share I just wish that \n\n&gt; our yahoo group wasnt so limited on space (and that I wasnt so \n\n&gt; limited on time). But I have found a way around it. If just a few \n\n&gt; people signed up and shared using esnips they can invite others to \n\n&gt; visit thier files and once they do they also get 50 gigs of free \n\n&gt; space for audio pictures or video or whatever you want to post.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; I was considering setting up one &quot;group&quot; account to start with and \n\n&gt; inviting all members who post files to join it and be able to post \n\nto \n\n&gt; the account. It will automatically notify everyone thats a member \n\n&gt; when a file is added to it just like the yahoo group does. It also \n\n&gt; allows you to share with the public or privately if you so choose. \n\n&gt; You can even allow your friends to post to your account if you wish.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; This group has grown and expanded and we just need to make a few \n\n&gt; changes to how we do things to keep it running more smoothly for \n\nthe \n\n&gt; future. I am hoping that you all will help me in this endeavor. I \n\n&gt; know many of you have already adapted the idea to help us organize \n\n&gt; and maintain the group.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; I want you to keep sharing and to be able to share more! \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; So please organize and not post stray files that are targets for \n\n&gt; deletion once the que is 100% full.
