<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, I know. People that think they can make a name for themselves
debunking, and the ones wanting to sell their own versions of the box. Many
want to be TAPS and Chirs Moon. I don&#x27;t understand it. One thing though,
without Moon, no one would know about the box! It&#x27;s these skeptics and
debunkers that try to make him look bad.

 I don&#x27;t know what the answer is.

&gt;   I guess the format of this site is the best we can have for sharing this
&gt; stuff. EVP&#x27;s are one thing, but info from the real-time gathering seems more
&gt; plentiful in intelligence we are receiving. I personally was able to get
&gt; feedback from a deceased loved one on whether they wre ok on the other side
&gt; and so on by whomever the messenger was. I do get quite disgusted with the
&gt; ones scrambling to score a carreer in this stuff and the ones who go as far
&gt; to infiltrate groups with their own team &#x27;plants&#x27; to steal info and scoop
&gt; ideas and so on. You&#x27;d be surprised at who they are.
