<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Oooh, that would be cool. I&#x27;ve always wondered if the power of a
spirit has to do with its ability to communicate through EVP. Perhaps
light is an easier medium to manipulate. I like doing computer
generated noise played randomly. I had an idea too. What if you
managed to record the live feed of the random noise, then subtracted
that from the playback version, so all that would be left is the
difference made by entities. The hardest part would just be finding a
way to record the live feed without the entity changing it too.

&gt;  But what if one used a solar panel as a source of tuning voltage,
using a pot to set a spot on the AM or FM band, so the tuning range is
farily narrow, requiring less change in light, then see if the
entities can manipulate the tuning(light) enough to get a message
through?
