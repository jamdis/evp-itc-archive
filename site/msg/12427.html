<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You honestly don&#x27;t need sponsors for these types of things, I&#x27;ve run
several such events over the years (including a traveling event).  You
just need a coordinator(s) in a proposed location to do the legwork,
find a cheap meeting place (there&#x27;s plenty of free ones as well) and
collect donations to cover the cost.  The cost should be minimal.

&gt; The first step should be to see if there are any sponsors 
&gt; interested.  That would take care of many of the $$$ issues.  I know 
&gt; there are some on this forum who have been involved in these type 
&gt; meetings.  I wonder if any of them would be willing to consider 
&gt; taking on this effort.
&gt; 
&gt; Don&#x27;t ask Radio Shack though... Their lawyers have already contacted 
&gt; me with one of those legal threats.

&gt; &gt; To rent a space, money can be donated prior to dates being set. It  
&gt; &gt; takes planning, dedication, and organization. And of course 
&gt; willing  
&gt; &gt; people who can afford to take time off from work and also travel.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I for one would not have any interest in a &quot;certification&quot; 
&gt; program  
&gt; &gt; &gt; or any fee involved with one.  I do believe a fee for direct  
&gt; &gt; &gt; expenses such as meeting room, coffee, equipment rental, gas  
&gt; &gt; &gt; expenses for the coordinator etc. is not only appropirate but  
&gt; &gt; &gt; esential for a group meeting.  I also heartedly believe that a 
&gt; small  
&gt; &gt; &gt; fee for direct expenses is important for demonstrating 
&gt; appreciation  
&gt; &gt; &gt; of value on the part of participants.  If zero is paid, it&#x27;s too  
&gt; &gt; &gt; easy to say &quot;yes, I&#x27;m in&quot; and then never show.  The money is a  
&gt; &gt; &gt; token.  That&#x27;s been my experience.  But that&#x27;s just me.   ron
