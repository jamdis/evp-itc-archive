          Frank you really impressed people with your research, your passion for
ITC, and especially your recordings. Thanks for being a big part of
the retreat and giving everyone a heartfelt talk about your work.

Also a thanks to Bill for being there and showing up with his array of
digital dowsing gear and data logging software. It was interesting to
have both of you side by side showing alternate approaches to audio ITC.

By the way, in excess of $15k was donated to the Shriner's Children's
Hospital from this event.

I loaned a box to another group, and they also got entities to answer
questions, and interact.
