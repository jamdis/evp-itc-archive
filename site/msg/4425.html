<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Oh, Bruce...I agree.  

The stuff I have been working on outside this ghost box stuff was 
completely led by &quot;spirits&quot; on the other side.  My job, if you will, 
was to begin a website and build it for the sole purpose of getting 
others to consider that there might be more than the physical realm.  
That led to Angels &amp; Ghosts in 2004, and I had no idea why that name 
was given, but I went with it.  I love the tech side, but have felt 
the goal of A &amp; G was to make people think and decide for themselves. 
There are plenty of the debunkers, TAPS type investigators out there, 
and that was not the vision I had been given (though I like that 
approach).  We recieve submissions from all over the world of audio, 
pictures, videos, stories, etc, and then I post much if it monthly.  
Again, the site&#x27;s flavor is &quot;you decide.&quot;  In the digital age, there 
is no way to authenticate what&#x27;s absolutely truth, from fiction.  So, 
again my mantra has been, &quot;You decide.&quot;  Do I think everything on A &amp; 
G is of ghosts and spirits?  Nah...not my job to anyway.  I make it 
interesting, and allow the minds of the visitors to decide.  That&#x27;s 
been my job and the spirits&#x27; beckoning.  They want people to begin 
looking for more than what the five sense can bring them.  I feel 
they speak often, but we don&#x27;t listen enough.  However, I also feel 
they speak often and we think it is coincidence or better yet our own 
thoughts - LOL. ;)  

January of &#x27;07 began with a dream and a &quot;new technology&quot; I was to 
work on that would be big.  I sort of blew it off as a pizza dream, 
but then was led to contact people from my past for &quot;other purposes&quot; 
of business  This of course unwittingly led back to this whole 
communication box, again.  They (spirits) will not let up on me.

So I am working on projects and I get nudged in the spirit to get on 
this box thing again.  I pop on here, see the latest news with the RS 
Hack (they bugged me as soon as it broke, but I stalled a few days) 
and am now running experiments, etc with it.  I am posting articles, 
videos and audio about it to spread the word.  More to come...

&gt; LC,
&gt;  
&gt; They not only see a bigger picture but have set all the wheels for 
it in motion.
&gt; These new rapid developments are not pure chance or coincidence.
&gt; We as researchers and developers have been set on a path and we 
will follow it until our job
&gt; is done.

&gt; Perhaps those on the other side are more urgent, anxious and 
excited about the box breakthroughs than even we are. Could it be 
because they see a bigger picture coming to pass?- LC--- In EVP-

&gt; There is a certain urgency to Box messages - sort of like they need 
&gt; to convey quickly. The same thing happens in video ITC, it&#x27;s like &gt; 
there is but a moment and we all better pay attention. -Bill&gt; &gt; ---

&gt;&gt; &gt; Willy, Really interested in listening to the new files. I&#x27;ll let 
&gt; you know after.&gt; &gt; Just to throw in regarding EVP maker and 
everything else but the &gt; boxes. I used EVP maker and the water 
method AND foreign language &gt; broadcast method and radio static and 
box fan, etc etc etc before I &gt; got my shack hack and my Joe&#x27;s box, 
and I must admit that I have put &gt; everything else aside even though 
I got good results with ALL of &gt; those other methods. There&#x27;s just 
something very exciting about the &gt; boxes, I think, that makes us 
forsake all others. When I started &gt; using a hack, which Jeff Rezman 
made for me before I got the Joe&#x27;s &gt; Box, I felt it was a nervous 
sort of experimentation--that is to say, &gt; the loud, short, fast 
sound clips had me on edge, as I was used to &gt; quiet static and 
water, but I think now I&#x27;m addicted to the sound and &gt; the frenzy of 
it! Does anyone else feel this way?&gt; &gt; Ursula&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; billliscomb

feedback. &gt; I &gt; &gt; really appreciate you taking the time to listen, 
and for the &gt; &gt; comments, especially noting the dual layers of 
speech. Interesting. &gt; &gt; Frank S. - Thanks for the recent files from 
EVPmaker - nice! &gt; &gt; There hasn&#x27;t been much discussion regarding 
EVPmaker lately, so I &gt; &gt; wasn&#x27;t&#x27; sure if it was a viable tool to 
use. I haven&#x27;t read many &gt; &gt; older posts, but hope to get caught up 
during the holidays. Have &gt; you &gt; &gt; or others considered modifying 
speech synthesis software to &gt; generate &gt; &gt; random sounds? I wonder 
how something like that would work&gt; &gt; On the 16th I did three 
3minute recordings and got 9 clips from &gt; &gt; them. In this session, I 
was asking questions regarding a knocking &gt; &gt; sound I heard while 
going to sleep or waking up about 12 years ago. &gt; &gt; My life situation 
wasn&#x27;t the best at that time. It was always three &gt; &gt; knocks, and 
once a doorbell, but not the doorbell for where I was &gt; &gt; then 
living. Started the Knocking session by telling &quot;Rick&quot; that I &gt; &gt; got 
messages from previous session, got &quot;Well, he&#x27;s got patience!&quot; &gt; &gt; 
for response. Then was told, &quot;Aye, it smells in here.&quot; Next asked &gt; &gt; 
them what sound did I hear back then, and got &quot;it was knocking &gt; 
(maybe &gt; &gt; nothing?)&quot; The best one so far is; &quot;Our earthbound 
forefathers are &gt; &gt; video programs.&quot; A second voice keeps 
repeating &quot;Ent&quot; syllable &gt; &gt; during this one. I have put these files 
in a new folder called &gt; &gt; Knocking, which is under Laptop MP3s. More 
comments there. &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m making progress on getting the software 
needed to do &gt; &gt; linear scanning with the Radio Shark 2 USB am/fm 
radio and hope to &gt; &gt; have it up and running within the next week or 
two. &gt; &gt; Thanks again to all&gt; &gt; Willy&gt; &gt;&gt;
