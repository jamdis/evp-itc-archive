<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi David, if you do a search for &quot;Audacity&quot;, you&#x27;ll find links that 
will allow you to select the version that is correct for your operating 
system. It&#x27;s totally free software and is popular with those who wish 
to record and analyze EVPs. It&#x27;s got the noise reduction features that 
some find useful when wishing to reduce 60 Hz hum.

Regards, Bill Murphy

&gt;  I have been recording evp&#x27;s for over 3 years now and I think I have 
&gt; heard it all, from a little girl that was raped &quot; tore my cloths 
&gt; off&quot;, &quot;I was very scared&quot; then &quot; I died in the snow&quot; to the same 
voice 
&gt; that cusses me out every time I record. Now Im looking for a free or 
&gt; very cheap audio program to help clean the recordings up to make them 
&gt; clearer. any suggestions? thanks.
