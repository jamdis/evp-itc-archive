This has gotten to the point where i can't even do a session anymore becaus=
e i'm so blocked by negative thoughts from this group it's pointless to con=
centrate on the box and get results. Honestly who cares what chris does any=
way, does it really affect everyone's lives that much. I have a job and thi=
s is a hobby that i used to really like, but now this board has brought me =
down. It seems all people want to do is make this like a street fight with =
challenges and negative views and for what reason? If anyone is concerned a=
bout hearing Chris's audio, i have about 2 hours of box sessions from Easte=
rn State on my web site for all to listen to. It's www.keyportparanormal.co=
m and go to investigation and click on eastern state. All the audio is at t=
he bottom of that page and you guys can judge for yourself and i heard a lo=
t come out of that box that night personally because i repeated a lot of st=
uff back to chris that i heard. Enough already, let's move on to the next g=
reat thing. That radio shack hack was a great breakthrough here, let's just=
 be happy we got that before it was shut down. Now we have another avenue t=
