Frank, what you are doing with the boxes is interesting. I think the draw t=
o the box for ghost hunters is that it "appears" to be a communication devi=
ce with the dead. I've been experimenting a lot with the radio shack hack b=
ox and I have been getting a lot. For the most part I am using it to get an=
swers to questions I or others have in areas that have had strange events o=
r just a paranormal nature to them. There is definitely communication at a =
rudimentary level although I doubt that all of it is honest communication. =
I definitely see a lot of the trickster influence with these boxes. It can =
and does tell people what they want to hear, and it seems to be reading the=
 minds of the participants. Like someone will crack a joke and the box will=
 respond 2 seconds later saying simply "joke". I was using the box in one a=
rea with a recently married woman and the word pregnant came out of the box=
 3 times during the 2 sessions. I think the box was picking up on her consc=
ious or subconscious thoughts. I have not gotten the word pregnant since th=
en. 

So far both radio shack types I have are working spectacularly for me=
. One of the more interesting responses I've gotten out of the box is that =
it has said "ovulous" backwards (it said "75" forwards), and that was just =
10 minutes or so after I was playing around with the Ovilus. I don't know e=
xactly how The Ovilus is supposed to be pronounced but the box pronounced i=
t like I spelled it above.

So what is going on with these boxes is extreme=
ly interesting and not readily explainable by science, but I lean away from=
 thinking the communications are coming from ghosts or demons, I am thinkin=
g it is just transferring thought into messages or it is higher beings answ=
ering our questions (although not always truthfully). I have to say I was h=
ighly skeptical that I would get anything with these type of boxes but I ha=
ve been fascinated by the results. I've played what I am hearing for others=
 and have done sessions with others, and these people have all been impress=
ed too. Thanks for bringing this technology to the forefront like you have.=

   I have playe=

ox. 
   
   In this test I used two tones, guessing, about 800hz, and aroun=
d 1khz. The tones are mixed with the radio audio. The exact frequency is no=

   My=

the time. I've said it a thousand times, the box is not the only method, th=

 more of a ghost hunters group, something I don't agree with.
