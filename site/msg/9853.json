Just use the patch cord I described in my previous \nresponse ... connect it from the \n&gt; headphone jack on the recorder to the mic jack on your computer.  \nOpen Audacity (or \n&gt; whatever), hit the record button, then hit the play button on the \nrecorder to play the \n&gt; session into the computer.  \n&gt; \n&gt; When you&#39;re done, press the stop button on the recording software, \nthe stop button on \n&gt; the recorder itself, and then save your session.  From there, you \ncan begin to work with it, \n&gt; without worry of losing any data.  Just be sure when you close the \nfile DON&#39;T SAVE \n&gt; CHANGES on the original, so you always have the raw version to \nrefer back to.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can do this same thing with any recorder that has an earphone \njack.  Just go with the \n&gt; one you are drawn to.  There are a bunch of them on eBay.  If you \nare doing sweep, you \n&gt; don&#39;t even need a digital recorder, just plug in a mic into your \ncomputer and record on it.  \n&gt; This saves you all the time and hassle of moving the file from the \nrecorder into your \n&gt; computer.  That&#39;s what I do.  You really only need a digital \nrecorder for traditional work or \n&gt; portability (unless you have a laptop, which is pretty easy to take \nwith you.)  :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psfponies&quot; &lt;psfponies@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Can anyone tell what would be the best way to transfer a session \nI \n&gt; &gt; recorded on an older microcassette recorder to my computer? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I did my first recorded session last night. All went great except \nfor \n&gt; &gt; the lousy reception. I didn&#39;t realize just how much you miss \nduring a \n&gt; &gt; real time session when you play back what you recorded. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I got two different Steve&#39;s one sounded Australian and a Mike. I \nalso \n&gt; &gt; got the number &quot;Seven&quot; I am sure there is lots more there but my \n&gt; &gt; reception was so bad I can&#39;t hear everything.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also what would be a good digital recorder (relatively cheap) to \nget \n&gt; &gt; that you can easily transfer to your computer?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any help would be appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kay\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
