You just said you "had it with this group" .=C2=A0 

To just dismiss all th=
e people here like that, who have their own beliefs and experiences, and wh=
o are trying to learn, as somehow inferior to you, seems to me pretty insul=
ting to them.=C2=A0 I disagree that the people here are=C2=A0 "idiots" just=
 because they want to test their ideas.=C2=A0 I think I'd rather have a ske=
ptic question my evidence, than someone who just mocks people with differen=
t opinions from their own.
