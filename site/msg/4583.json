I was talking\n&gt; with a friend about EVPs last night, and she mentioned this forum\n&gt; which I&#39;d not heard of before. I&#39;m really looking forward to reading\n&gt; through the posts and seeing/listening to your evidence.\n&gt;\n&gt; I just took a quick look at some photos, which reminded me of what I&#39;d\n&gt; seen on the Scole Experiment book. Doing a search on the word &quot;Scole&quot;\n&gt; in the forum turned up lots of results. I&#39;m so excited to be in\n&gt; contact with people who have actually even HEARD of the Scole\n&gt; experiments! It makes me feel like some of the predictions or messages\n&gt; received in the Scole communications are coming to fruition [as far as\n&gt; that as a world-wide growing awareness of ITC and the possibilities it\n&gt; represents].\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m constantly surprised by the opportunities for connections and\n&gt; knowledge that turn up during my constant quest for answers.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope I can contribute something worthwhile to this forum!\n&gt;\n&gt; Deb T.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\nHi Debbie!
