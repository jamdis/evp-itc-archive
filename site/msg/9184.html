Mis.Lyn told me about his group. Thanks Lyn! I want to build my own Franks Box but I think it is going to be more difficult than I thought.
   Leslie took my digital recorder to the basment to leave it there while she was at work. I am listening to it while I type. We have had a problem with her little boy ghost Robert only whispering when he answers questions. At the begining of the recording I heard her ask Robert to speak up and talk louder LOL!!! I have heard what sounds like a box being shoved across the floor. I will have to show her this.Nobody is at home while this recording is going on.
  Hugs,Elizabeth

Hi Elizabeth,

AHA! You appear here, too!
:-)

No, I haven't done that yet. I dug thru my junquebox of electronic parts 
to gather together what I needed to make one, but didn't have a few parts 
and never got around to ordering them. Maybe one of these days, I hope ...
