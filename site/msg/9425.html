I'm guessing nobody believes me! O well I would like to tell you that it really is true, and I know in my heart, because I was there.  Not sure why them cpu went off, but maybe I had too much infomation then they wanted me too.( I record write on to my laptop, and I don't use any type of digital or analog recorder).  I will prove it again.  Tonight I am going to do everything the same to see if I can get it to happen again.

          Hey guys

I had the most amazing session last night. Me and my fiance 
did a session, and this is how it went. 

We usally do 10 min. of audio, and during the session we first 
contacted a guy named Virgil, and we got him to say both of our 
names. He said "William" for me, and "Leigh" for Ashley. We all 
communicated for the 10 min. He didn't answer every question, but 
he answered 75% of all answerslast night. We told him that we 
wanted to prove that they exsisted on the other side. Life after 
death. He answer "we are over here", very plainly. After the 10 
min. We ask for confirmation so we could shut off the radio, and we 
got this answer "that would be a bad idea". Which freaked Ashley 
out. So we kept the radio on and we had a conversation with this 
preacher, then while the band was still sweeping the preacher came 
through and he talked to us (while sweeping the band), and started 
to preach to us about our side, and how messed up it is.(the band 
was sweeping the whole time, I never stop the band from sweeping) 
He said that we needed to pray for our enemies as well as our 
friends and families. He talked to us for 6 to eight minutes. 
Then we finished the session (Ask for confirmation)when he didn't 
come through any more. We shut down. Then of course I get up and 
put everything back the way it is supposed to be. Leaving the 
session that we just did on the laptop. Then I went to take a 
shower, and I come back. The laptop was turned off and I lost all 
of the session. Sometimes the computer will log itself off, then 
when you get back it is exactly the was it was when you left it. 
But this wasn't the case, some reason the laptop shut itself off, 
and we lost all of the evidence that we had. Didn't have nothing, 
and I couldn't believe that we lost everything. So thats why I am 
sitting here typing away about what happen last night. Instead of 
me posting files about what happen last night. I wish so bad that 
y'all would have been able to hear the communication. It was a life 
changing experience. It made me think a whole lot different about 
box research. I still can't believe I didn't save it before the 
computer turned itself off. That is what happen to me last night, 
and change box research for me for the rest of my life.

Thanks

William Rees Clarke III
