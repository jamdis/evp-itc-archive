<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank,

Well I agree on most of your postings. I&#x27;m a big fan of yours, by the 
way. I am impressed with your ability to adapt your surroundings in 
order to communicate with other energies. I am also very glad to have 
found this Yahoo group.

The only thing I&#x27;m curious about is the term &#x27;ghost hunters group&#x27; 
and why you don&#x27;t agree with it.

I 100% agree that I don&#x27;t need to go anywhere special to do evp. I 
get it walking my dog, going up my stairs, sitting at my table, 
etc... but there is an occasion when someone is upset and scared in 
their own home or business and wants to have someone try to find out 
the nature of what is co-existing with them in that space.

I will respectfully go (with other like minded individuals) to an 
area that I feel has some paranormal activity or to an area I have 
been asked to visit because the occupants feel there is paranormal 
activity. I do not solicit my help and I do not advertise. These 
people seek me out.

When traveling to another location away from my home and entering 
someone else&#x27;s turf, anything can happen and it is always better to 
have a buddy along when you go to locations that are unfamiliar to 
you and you don&#x27;t know the people there. Hence my buddy, or more, 
come with me to observe and/or assist in helping to determine the 
nature of the situation surrounding paranormal events. For free, 
without a tv crew or radio station.

While I am of the opinion that these things aren&#x27;t harmful (nor are 
they all of the same origin), I always attempt to show the person and 
talk calmly with them about some of the possible reasons for the 
activity and why they should not be afraid. It helps if I get evp 
that I can share with them and they can relax and be at peace co-
existing with the energy there. I talk with other curious people who 
have questions also and I share with them your discoveries as well as 
Sarah Estep and her work with EVP. 

I also believe that it is very important to share these experiences 
in person with the masses (as much as one five foot woman) can do.  
Not by becoming a tv personality or anything of that sort but I do my 
best in my local area to bring others to a better understanding of 
the complex and wonderful world we live in.  If they are thrilled by 
the discovery that we are definitely not alone I have no problem with 
being a part of that. I consider it an honor. It is my gift to them.

I have seen people become more spiritual as a result of what I have 
shared with them and I am full of joy over that. They become more 
aware of their effect on others and if they alter their behavior to 
the good of themselves and the others around them then I feel I have 
done a good thing.

I do not believe that the knowledge of spirit communication should 
only belong to one particular sect of individuals. Who am I to hold 
back on sharing with any individual or any group of people who are 
seeking this experience? Or the technical aspects. It&#x27;s denies them 
the &#x27;possibilities&#x27; of observing an afterlife. This defeats the 
purpose for wanting to study EVP. 

If we use your box, or any other piece of equipment we are not bad 
people because there are many of us together instead of just a single 
individual operating it.  

My group spent Sunday October 26th cleaning, praying (in each our own 
way) and showing respects to all the John, Jane and Baby Does in our 
city&#x27;s potter&#x27;s field. As well as paying respects in an old Chinese 
Sam Yup Cemetery next door. It does not matter each person&#x27;s race, 
gender or that some of us are Christian, some Wiccan, some Mormon, 
some Buddist, etc...  As imperfect people we all try to give back, in 
the only ways we have available to us at this time, to those energies 
that help us better understand our world. On that day and every day.

Please don&#x27;t put us all down as bad Frank. We are good people too. I 
can only speak for myself and my group. We wholeheartedly agree we 
are not experts--- we are in this with you and all of EVP-ITC in 
understanding and hopefully enhancing the development spirit 
communication. You won&#x27;t see any of us on a soap box. But we 
are &#x27;labeled&#x27; and it troubles me that we are criticized for being a 
group instead of for individual trespasses.

We admire and respect you much. Hope you maybe change your idea about 
all &#x27;ghost hunters groups&#x27;.

Thank you,
Clara

&gt;  I know, doesn&#x27;t fit the latest ghost hunting theories, and it has 
been poor at attracking the lime lights, but here it is. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I have played with the idea of adding in a tone to act as a 
foundation for the ghost voices in the boxes, it seems to works.the 
first example is on my site, http://purplealiengirl.tripod.com/ , 
noted which one it it there. The second attempt was wiht box 24, but 
the tuner was som noisy I kinda gave up on that box. 
&gt;  
&gt;  In this test I used two tones, guessing, about 800hz, and around 
1khz. The tones are mixed with the radio audio. The exact frequency 
is not all the important, as these are square waves, which contain 
all harmonics. This is manual sweep only, the sweep circuit is not 
build yet. 
&gt;  
&gt;  My approach is testing and developing, I don&#x27;t try to sell this 
stuff at this point, and I can&#x27;t make boxes for very many requesters, 
I just don&#x27;t have the time. I&#x27;ve said it a thousand times, the box is 
not the only method, there are many related methods of using raw 
audio. This group has turned into more of a ghost hunters group, 
something I don&#x27;t agree with.
