I am no longer connected to Haunted Times in any way, \nexcept Chris \n&gt; Moon can keep and use the Ghost Boxes he has, I won&#39;t be supplying \nanymore.  \n&gt; I very much dislike the concept, and activity of &quot;ghost huning&quot;, \nthere too \n&gt; many egos, associated wiht it, to many that think they are the \nworlds only \n&gt; paranoramal experts, and way too much focus on the negative, \nand &quot;scary&quot; \n&gt; aspects.  My systems are not designed for that ....stuff, and I \ncan&#39;t \n&gt; support those activities, even it means that I don&#39;t personaly put \nany more \n&gt; of my boxes out there in the public. The information for making \nthis stuff \n&gt; is out there, and others can build this stuff, and do whatever they \nwant \n&gt; with it. I doubt if there will be many &quot;Frank&#39;s Box&quot; clones out \nthere, while \n&gt; the circuits are straight forward, it takes the &quot;certain \nunderstanding&quot; to \n&gt; get it to work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Exercise your brain!
