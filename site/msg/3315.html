<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree. As an author, I am attacked all the time for &quot;exploiting&quot; 
Chicago&#x27;s haunted history and those who have had personal experiences 
with the paranormal phenomena at the sites about which I write.  But I 
have found that it is only one&#x27;s jealous colleagues (or wanna-bes) who 
complain. Those who are honestly interested in the phenomena and in 
learning about its meaning in their lives are grateful for what you do.
I am such a shy person, and I loathe the natural attention that comes 
from what I do.  But you have a duty as a researcher to bring your 
findings to those who are interested in them.  When you do, the jealous 
and the skeptical will attack you, make no bones about it, and 
(ironically) they will say first off that you are arrogant and self-
serving, and that you love the limelight.  Some people who love 
attention thrive on that negative attention; for me it&#x27;s torture.  But 
I have to deal with it, and so do you!

I would like very much to have you publicly talk about your research.  
What good is it if it doesn&#x27;t help idiots like us figure out how to do 
our own?:)</pre>
