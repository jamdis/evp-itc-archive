<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi everyone ...
I&#x27;m David Koenig. I will be a co-host on a new internet radio show with
Paranormalist Jim Callahan from the TV show Phenomenon (He was the guy who
got in a fight with Criss Angel)
We would love to play any good EVP&#x27;s or other communications that you&#x27;ve
recorded.
Thanks

&gt; Nothing. But scientific methodology implies not assuming anything - not
&gt; assuming the presence or absence of anything paranormal.
&gt;
&gt; If you read this woman&#x27;s blogs, she&#x27;s already assumed there&#x27;s nothing there
&gt; before even beginning to test things.

&gt;&gt;   What&#x27;s wrong with testing the box using a scientific methodology?

&gt;&gt;  I was lead to believe this person had an interset in the box, and she
&gt;&gt; brought her &quot;boyfirend&quot; that just happen to be local, to our meeting the
&gt;&gt; other day. I let them &quot;barrow&quot; #63, now  I&#x27;m sure she will claim she tested
&gt;&gt; the box &quot;scientifically, and can prove it does not work.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Karen had contacted me via e-mail requesting a meeting. I thought she was
&gt;&gt; someone off the group and has an interest in EVP and the boxes. She did
&gt;&gt; mention she was a skeptic, but I didn&#x27;t think debunker, or a professional
&gt;&gt; skeptic--wonder who pays these twits?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  These skeptics don&#x27;t allow themselves to hear anything, yet will proclaim
&gt;&gt; that as proof the boxes and EVP don&#x27;t work, as if their hearing is somehow
&gt;&gt; better than the average persons ear. If a person doesn&#x27;t want to hear it,
&gt;&gt; they won&#x27;t, and because they can&#x27;&#x27;t hear EVP that means no one else an
&gt;&gt; either.  Yeah, real scientific!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Gonna have to remember Google-googel- google!!
