There&#39;s a patch cord available from radio shack for about $5.  You connect one \nend to the ear jack of the recorder and the other to the &#39;sound in&#39; on the computer.  I use \na freeware program called Audacity to record.  Just play the file into the computer (rather \nthan doing an actual transfer).  Hope this helps some.\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;lunalamia&quot; &lt;rainspirit1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all, new comer Laura here.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have an older version digital voice recorder.\n&gt; Panasonic RR-QR 160.\n&gt; I have used it for regular evp, but now want to listen to recordings on \n&gt; my computer...an hopefully post them to the group.\n&gt; \n&gt; This model has no usb, only 2 plug in holes on top, headphones and mic.\n&gt; Is there an adapter cord of a sort that I can get to run from the mic \n&gt; in the voice recorder to the mic in the computer and record? \n&gt; I&#39;d really like to actually use it and post, etc.  \n&gt; \n&gt; If there is not, or no one knows of an adapter, anyone know of a better \n&gt; voice recorder to get that is cheap!  lol\n&gt; \n&gt; I am in the middle of hacking a 20-125, thanks to some help from Bruce, \n&gt; and I want to record and post what I get .....\n&gt; \n&gt; Any suggestions anyone? \n&gt; ~ Laura\n&gt;"}
