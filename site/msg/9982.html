<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Wow, I guess I&#x27;ve really stirred up a hornets&#x27; nest with my comment on
editing EVP... sorry for that! ;-)

Well, much has been said, and I see both sides: One side are messages
themselves which serve to gain knowledge about the spirit world (or
whatever we are contacting). The other side is the scientific aspect of
this research. In my view, both sides are equally important.

Especially in the field of borderland sciences, transparency is most
important to maintain credibility. It&#x27;s not about convincing skeptics
but to be taken serious by really interested people. We shouldn&#x27;t give
them unnecessary reasons for doubt in this important research if it can
be avoided easily.

&gt; Hi all,

&gt; just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I would
&gt; suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, in
&gt; order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can for
&gt; instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (including
&gt; the experimenter&#x27;s voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, but
&gt; not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP match
&gt; with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should always
&gt; be provided along with the edited version.

&gt; But that&#x27;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to express, as
&gt; we should always be able to present our results to a critical public.
