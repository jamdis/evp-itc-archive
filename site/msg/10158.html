<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Steve,

the CW decoder gets mainly the letters E, I and T.
I also noticed that the beeps are all the same length in your file.

So I made a raw audio file for EVPmaker that contains three cues: The
&quot;dit&quot; and &quot;dah&quot; beeps, and an &quot;intra-character gap&quot;:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Stefan/Morse%20code/morse.wav

The &quot;Use Cue List&quot; option must be checked in EVPmaker to use this file.

Now it sounds a bit more like actual morse code, and CwGet is able to
decode more letters. Perhaps some former ham operators &quot;over there&quot; are
able to use it... :)

&gt; Here&#x27;s the program if anybody wants to play around with it.  It also 
&gt; picks up stuff without playing the file through evpmaker and converts 
&gt; it into letters just by using the microphone on the computer.  I&#x27;m 
&gt; going to try and figure this out later, you can also cancel out 
&gt; certain frequencies too.  It&#x27;s worth exploring into this a bit.  For 
&gt; those who don&#x27;t get what i&#x27;m trying to do, i&#x27;m running my frequency 
&gt; file through evpmaker and it than sounds like morse code.  Than i&#x27;m 
&gt; using a program to try and convert the jumbled morse code sounding 
&gt; file from evpmaker into coherent messages typed on the computer 
&gt; screen.

  
&gt; The program is called Cwget.  I grew up on Ham Radio, so this doesn&#x27;t 
&gt; sound so far fetched for me.  But sorry if i&#x27;m losing some people on 
&gt; this method.

&gt; p.s.  The program was too large for yahoo, so here&#x27;s a link:
