It is now 7/10/2010.  I will leave it there 4 days, and remove it Noon Denver time, on Wednesday, 7/14/2010.\n&gt; \n&gt; All you have to do is ask your boxes/spirits/aliens/etc, what it is.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have taken a picture of it, and posted it to the files section here, so there is no way I can squirm out of the results:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip\n&gt; \n&gt; Please do not try to open the file before noon Wednesday.  But feel free to download it to your computer beforehand, so you can be sure I won&#39;t change it during, or after, the test.\n&gt; \n&gt; Answers anyone reveals after noon Wednesday don&#39;t count. Partial answers (like just the color, or shape, or some emotion vibe) don&#39;t count.  Just tell me what it is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best of Luck. I hope for this to be a regularly occurring experiment, and I hope we all can learn from the results.\n&gt;"}
