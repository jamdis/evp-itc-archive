<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for posting the info, Frank. 
Ive had a play with the MK484 a while ago. It seems very quiet compared to superhet chips, but havent connected a sweep waveform to it.

&gt;  It&#x27;s in my folder here, I just uploaded it. It worked as a radio, and the audio was really clean. Don&#x27;t foget you have to tweak the antenna turns, and positon on the ferrite core to get optimimum results. If you do a google on the MK484, there&#x27;s some source of kits for this radio.
&gt; 
&gt;  Joe--I foget his last name--that make&#x27;s Joe&#x27;s Box, had a version with this chip for AM reception.

&gt; &gt; Hi Frank,
&gt; &gt; Have you posted the schematic of the TRF circuit? I may have missed this if so. Would be interested to see it. Presume you used the MK484 TRF chip?
&gt; &gt; Incidentally, I heard comment a while ago that the Minibox uses the MK484 chip.

&gt; &gt; &gt;  If all this EVP stuff is imagination, how come I don&#x27;t hear squat for ghost
&gt; &gt; &gt; voices in the audio from the TRF radios? The audio is loud and clear, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; broadcast fragments easily decernable, but few, if any ghost voices. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; thought I got some with a single tuner, but with the double tuner--nothin&#x27;!
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  I have to wonder if the down conversion process in the standard radio
&gt; &gt; &gt; design is part of the box EVP. In super hetrodyne radios, the original RF
&gt; &gt; &gt; signal is converted to a lower fixed frequency, usually 455khz. So just
&gt; &gt; &gt; providing the raw audio seems to be only part of the box functions, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; other tuned circuits must play a parts--the IF transformers being tuned
&gt; &gt; &gt; circuits, plus the antenna, and the oscillator. Somethin&#x27; th think about!
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  I tried an LA1135 chip this morning, same as the car tuners use, and it
&gt; &gt; &gt; sounds like a car tuner--so it&#x27;s back to the LM3820.
