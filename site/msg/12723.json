I know that he is not coming from a totally\nskeptical place with what he was saying, however, even if everything\ncould be totally repeatable in a lab, no evidence will ever be good\nenough. Everyone called Marconi &quot;crazy&quot; when he was down in marconi\nmeadows, a part of city park in New Orleans, but radio was still born.\n\nI say let them call us crazy and say what they want to. They will do\nit anyways. We know the results that we are getting. If the world\ndoesn&#39;t want to recognize it yet, its their problem. We will just be\nlaughing at them through one of your boxes that someone digs out of an\nattic in 100 years from now...lol\n\njon\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, suzanne bibb &lt;suzyq6819@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Everyone in favor say &quot;Frank&quot;!\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Mon, 11/10/08, purplespacefriend &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: purplespacefriend &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Chris Moon and his use of Franks Box gets slammed\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Monday, November 10, 2008, 8:45 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; A moron with title and degree--like that&#39;s any differnt! \n&gt; \n&gt; F-S\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Chris Moon and his use of Franks Box gets slammed\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Last night on Coast to Coast AM George Noory had Dr. Stephen Rorke\n&gt; &gt; on-air. He discussed the field of instrumental transcommunication\n&gt; &gt; (ITC), his study of the Spiricom case, Frank&#39;s Box, and EVP \n&gt; capture.\n&gt; &gt; It was during his discussion of Frank&#39;s Box where he brought up \n&gt; the name\n&gt; &gt; Chris Moon. He also brought up exactly what he thought of Chris \n&gt; Moon&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; use of the Franks Box he calls his telephone to the dead.\n&gt; &gt; Better than writng about it, I&#39;ve placed a link to the audio from \n&gt; last\n&gt; &gt; night, at my post below.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://ufomagazine. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/chris- moon-and-\nhis-use-of-\n&gt; franks&#92;\n&gt; &gt; -box.html\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://ufomagazine. blogspot. com/2008/ 11/chris- moon-and-\nhis-use-of-\n&gt; frank&#92;\n&gt; &gt; s-box.html&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Mike (UFO Geek)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
