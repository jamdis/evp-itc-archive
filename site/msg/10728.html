Agreed.  I've been wanting to visit Dr. Moody for a while or at least build the same type of room he did.  I probably won't though, or at least won't for a while.

The ancient Greeks were way ahead of Nostradamus with their 
psychomanteum work (more recently resurrected by famed NDE researcher - 
Raymond Moody...see his book "Reunions" for more details). One of the 
major Psychomanteums (big "P") that Moody visited was a huge complex 
which culminated in a large, darkened room containing a huge, bronze or 
copper kettle filled with water wherein particpants could commune with 
their ancestors.
