Nice job. Had to lol at the point\nwhere the seagull flew over your studio. :)\n\nYour new SJ box looks, and sounds nice. Did you already receive EVPs\nwith it? How did you build up the EMF part of the device?\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Hello:\n&gt; I just finished my portable (field use) Speakjet box.  You can see it\n&gt; in my pictures and hear it in my audio files.  Both are under Dead\n&gt; Science.\n&gt; I have to say this thing is very neat!  It really does take EMF and\n&gt; produce words.  I will do sessions with it and post.  If you need any\n&gt; information on the box please feel free to email me or just wait for\n&gt; my next Podcast at www.deadscience.com and I will talk all about it.\n&gt; Rob."}
