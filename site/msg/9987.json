You can for\n&gt; instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (including\n&gt; the experimenter&#39;s voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, but\n&gt; not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP match\n&gt; with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should always\n&gt; be provided along with the edited version.\n\n&gt; But that&#39;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to express, as\n&gt; we should always be able to present our results to a critical public.\n\n&gt; Stefan\n\n\n\n                           \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
