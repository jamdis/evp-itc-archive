<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I deleted several &quot;responses&quot; because I wanted to put an end to the 
arguements, but kept canceling. I don&#x27;t want to take this &quot;research&quot; 
that serious. 

 I just use the cut and try method for my stuff, there is no 
objective research to it. I am fascinated by the voices, and try 
everything I can to improve reception. I&#x27;m not all that concerned 
whether anyone accepts what I do or not. 

 After eight years of doing this stuff, I have no idea how these 
voices are made. Nor do I see any self proclaimed experts out there 
that actually know anything about the paranormal, that makes us all 
about equal. 

 I agree with banning those that insist on arguing, and name calling.

&gt; Sorry guy&#x27;s 
&gt;  
&gt; Was just finishing up deleting my files from the files section when
&gt; I saw this post and being an italian from brooklyn just could not 
live with
&gt; myself if I didn&#x27;t
&gt; respond.
&gt;  
&gt; Michelle be carefull what you say, if you are looking for a fraud 
you need
&gt; look no further than the end of your nose, which is where you will 
find the
&gt; asshole of the biggest fraud in the buisness.
&gt; your lord and master, need I mention the name, if you actuall took 
the time
&gt; to shut that sewer you call a mouth and listened to my files you 
would
&gt; realise that most of them I repeat the real time answer I hear 
fluidly.
&gt;  
&gt; If you have the balls which I think you do, tell your little buddy 
to come
&gt; to jersey because as a real man I was disabled saving lives so I 
can not go
&gt; to him or I would have been there already. instead of sucking my 
mama&#x27;s tit
&gt; like your mentor.
&gt; have him come to jersey and I will accomidate him in a live box 
session him
&gt; with his me with mine and we will see who the fraud really is. 
&gt;  
&gt; p.s. you would think after all that mouth action your jaw would be 
tired.

&gt; 
&gt; You&#x27;re correct Bruce, I only own a RS Hack 12-469 that I am testing.
&gt; You are incorrect about my concerns for research. You may look at me
&gt; as a stirrer of whatever you want to say I&#x27;m stirring. If it causes
&gt; one of you to consider the validity of the research then that is
&gt; great. One of you were very surprised to discover that time is being
&gt; removed from posted files. One of you freaked out when I suggested
&gt; that raw files should be whats posted. One offered to post both. One
&gt; said no way! One of you has files incredibly clearer than anyone 
else.
&gt; One of you is beginning to look a little less on the up and up. Two
&gt; have emailed me their own concerns for the integrity in research. 
Call
&gt; me what you will but, if integrity is what has you riled up, if a
&gt; desire for raw true files to be posted causes an issue then so be 
it.
&gt; Maybe your smelling the shit I stirred and maybe thats because you
&gt; just might be standing in it.

&gt; &gt; she&#x27;s a spy and a crap stirrer, the less she is here the better.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; She has no concern for the research or how it is conducted. Her 
only

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So maybe if we don&#x27;t pay attention to her she will go back where 
she

&gt; &gt; Also she can not post any box files because she does not have any.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If I misunderstood, then I certainly apologize. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Perhaps we&#x27;d react differently if you participated here more
&gt; often--posting your own files and asking questions of researchers. 
For
&gt; example, &quot;Hey, Ann--that file you just posted, I hear what you do, 
but
&gt; is anything clipped out of it? I think I hear a track silenced, too.
&gt; If so, why did you do that?&quot; Then I get to answer and explain why I
&gt; did it that way, offer the raw clip, or whatever. It doesn&#x27;t come 
off
&gt; as a broad attack--just a friendly question. Even Bruce wouldn&#x27;t rip
&gt; out your living eyeballs for that. (Well... maybe he wouldn&#x27;t, 
anyway.
&gt; ;) ) 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I agree with your search for The Truth. I really do. That&#x27;s why 
you
&gt; see me get all rough-and-tumble over stuff like the Luminator when I
&gt; think it is it lacking convincing evidence. But it&#x27;s waaaaaay too
&gt; early in &quot;boxology&quot; to try to make it perform as a pet circus 
animal.
&gt; Hell, we&#x27;ve been studying traditional EVP for 30 years and it still
&gt; won&#x27;t perform on cue for the scientists or anyone else. But if you
&gt; just listen to what you get on your own and what all the others are
&gt; getting, it becomes very clear indeed that a real phenomenon is
&gt; occurring. Sure, some things we get that we think are paranormal may
&gt; be just radio fragments, but one radio fragment does not negate all
&gt; box communication. One tweaked clip is not indicative of a culture 
of
&gt; researcher deceit. One &quot;I am Bazoozoo! Time to fry, foolish mortal!&quot;
&gt; does not mean that the RS hacks are pathways to Satan&#x27;s indoor
&gt; plumbing. There are no easy answers yet--and there may never be any.
&gt; And I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re at the stage yet where we have the right to
&gt; demand The Truth or whether we would even see it if it was staring 
us
&gt; in the face.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; All right, enough joy in myself one-hand clapping.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; LC is right that if you want to try to pursue this in the way you
&gt; want to pursue it, then you need to find some people who share your
&gt; mindset and go to it. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to find those 
people
&gt; here, necessarily--at least among the old guard. We&#x27;re the beatniks 
in
&gt; black leather, smoking ciggies and reading bad poetry to the beat of
&gt; bongos, HMO.

&gt; &gt; Just to clear things up.. the file I&#x27;m referring to is not from
&gt; anyoneinvolved in this group so when I say that occasionally I hear
&gt; theirvoices become shaky, that is not a comment on anyone here.
&gt; Also,please don&#x27;t misread what I actually said. The point I made, or
&gt; triedto make, about the investigators not hearing what I heard...
&gt; Iwouldn&#x27;t have heard all of it in real time either. Too many
&gt; layers,too fast, etc. I have the luxury now of sitting and analyzing
&gt; the filein my own time. As for fear being a factor... I do believe
&gt; that the attitude of theinvestigators present during a session does
&gt; effect the outcome. EvenBruce who would rather cut my eyeballs out
&gt; with a razor has said thesame. If you think that I am scared, fine. 
If
&gt; I&#x27;m missing one thing itis probably a healthy dose of fear. Don&#x27;t 
make
&gt; the mistake of missingthe points by name calling. I post my thoughts
&gt; here because it is an active group of peopleworking with this form 
of
&gt; ITC. You can call me a shit stirrer orwhatever you want. The point 
is
&gt; that I see issues that could beaddressed fairly easily. You can 
ignore
&gt; it or deflect all you want.For me, it&#x27;s not about being friends, 
it&#x27;s
&gt; about the research. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Ratka

&gt; this simple: if you are scared of lowerentities and you think that 
the
&gt; hacked radio you are using is really achannel for demon or whatever,
&gt; then just stop. Put the fricking radiodown and go get another hobby.
&gt; Leave it to those of us who aren&#x27;tafraid and don&#x27;t care if someone
&gt; calls us a bitch or a slut and triesto pawn themselves off as
&gt; Bazoozoo.&gt; &gt; &gt; Just. Stop. Listening. And. Worrying.&gt; &gt; &gt; And on top
&gt; of all that, in this quote below, you seem to be sayingthat the rest
