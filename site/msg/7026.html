I will be traveling to San Diego from Mexico to visit my sister and pick up the RS 125 Mike is sending me.  I will be in the San Diego and El Centro area from Feb 15 to 19 and I would love to be able to meet-up with someone from the area who has experience with EVP technology.  Mike is sending a box already hacked so we can work with the box and hopefully get something recorded.  Since I have little experience as a newbie to this, I would love to see how someone puts all of it together...recording, analyzing, etc.  
   
  If you have the time and are willing to give a little on-the-job training, please let me know by email.  By the way, in mid June I will be traveling from Penn. to NC for two weeks and would love to get together with folks over in that area.  I will probably be ordering a mini-box to be sent to my folks house in Allentown, so I will have that to play with.  Let me know.  Ron Lederer
