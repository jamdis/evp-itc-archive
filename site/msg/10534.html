<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just exagerating a bit, cuz one was scared of it. Misty says her 
guys would talk about 33 all the time, like it was a pivotal event.

&gt; Why do you call 33 the Devils Box, everybody is scared of?

of boxes actually spawned the hack, so everything for a

&gt; hack is almost as good, it does the job. 
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe, if I quit going off on tangents, and just get some boards 
&gt; professionally done....
&gt; 
&gt; I did have a couple boards made last fall for the LA1816, but the 
&gt; radio turned out to be just c-r-a-p-p-eee, I just set them aside. 
&gt; One all the wiring is done, and one is just the bare board. They 
are 
&gt; mostly SMT components. If there are some real techno-gurus out 
&gt; there, I don&#x27;t have a problem giving these boards away. The AM 
band 
&gt; works, but it&#x27;s kinda noisy, which could be just the wrong choice 
of 
&gt; IF cans, or maybe the RF amp. These are second gen boards for the 
&gt; LA1816, the first one I had the pin spacing too close for the 
radio 
&gt; chip. They have RVG, and linear, which also may contribute to 
noise. 
&gt; Randy Schnieder has one of these, that was 25, now I can&#x27;t 
remember 
&gt; what I did with 26, the ones I have on hand would be 28, and as 
yet 
&gt; an unassigned number. Oh yeah, Randy went halfers with the cost, 
so 
&gt; he has 26. 
&gt;

&gt; &gt; I think it is all an alter ego problem, certain people think 
they 
&gt; are blessed to have one of your boxes. Hell I could only wish to 
&gt; have one myself, but I know that their is not enough to go around, 
&gt; and also know that I probably will never be able to get one. So 
I&#x27;m 
&gt; content to have my Radio Shack Hack, without the ego problem. 
&gt; That&#x27;s fine with me, I feel great about being a member of this 
&gt; group, and making some friends. Maybe some day I might be able to 
&gt; use what I learn from y&#x27;all to build something for myself. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Later Guys, and have a great day

&gt; &gt; Hi All; We have been warned by others from time to time 
&gt; about unbridled box use, as it supposedly brings in negativity. I 
&gt; don&#x27;t want to believe that, but there are a few cases of people 
&gt; using boxes made by me, as well as the hack radios, and going 
whacko 
&gt; big time. Its&#x27; either all ego--I&#x27;m the onlyest one that can use 
&gt; this, or like the more recent example. I don&#x27;t know if these 
people 
&gt; were like this to start, or if it&#x27;s an external influance, but 
it&#x27;s 
&gt; discouraging. There seems to be a similar reaction with systems 
not 
&gt; made by me--so I&#x27;ve been told.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Soooo, maybe burn some white candles, and maybe get a Rosary. My 
&gt; guys talk about the Catholics, and the Purple Princess has a 
&gt; Catholic connection on the etheric levels, although the church 
&gt; imposes too many limits on her. I wouldn&#x27;t want to go into a state 
&gt; of fear, but a little protection stuff couldn&#x27;t hurt. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Not only do I not have the time to mass produce boxes, I&#x27;m 
&gt; beginning to think it&#x27;s not a good idea anyway.
