  "...
  Early telegraph lines intercepted earth energy with great regularity, often connected distant sacred spots together. We find all too numerous anecdotes and collections of reports in telegraphic trade journals, which indicate that an anomalous ground energy was entering the system components at certain critical seasons. These reports affirm that an earth "electricity" was energizing telegraph systems without the need for battery power at all.   Other reports tell of strange, automatic telegraph signals, which suddenly manifested during night hours. Still others report the peculiar ability of telegraph operators to "know who would call ... why they were calling ... and what the nature of the message would be". This phenomenon would be repeated in later years, when wireless operators began experiencing the very same things. The heightened consciousness experienced near these large grounded systems had everything to do with the reappearance of phenomena anciently observed
 along the meandering paths between sacred spots. The rediscovery of these anciently known truths was again making its appearance during the industrial revolution. ..."
