"Hi Frank, I know a lot of us were waiting for you to chime in...... I was=
 at 2 Radio Shacks tonight and there were a lot of 12-469's on the shelf th=
ere. If you need any just let me know. Jeff"
 
 Mostly I was just kidding a=
bout y'all buying up all the 469s. What I like about it, is using it as a t=
uner in a regular box, as I have yet to been able to make an FM receiver. I=
 wish I had the funds to buy maybe ten of the radios, but I can only get on=
e at time past the Ol' Lady.
