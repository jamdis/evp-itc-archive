On the hack radios you could just cut the VT wire and insert\nthe sweep voltage. I do that to other radios, find the tuning line with a\nvolt meter or scope, try to trace it back to it&#39;s source than interrupt it\nand insert the external sweep voltage. You can use a pot and a 9 volt\nbattery for manual sweep.
