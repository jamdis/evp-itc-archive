Frank,
 
Have you checked into nickel-metal hydride batteries.  The kind we use  in 
remote control car racing?  They come 6 cell at 7.2 volts or 7 cell at  8.4 
volts.  You can get individual cells and make your own packs and they  hold quite 
a bit of power.  Just a thought.

This  might work and the price is right. I actaully have two boards I want to 
 make, the sweep board, and the AM tuner board. Then I might want to make a  
complete board, tuner and all. I was working on a board made to fit a RS  
project box, so the sides taper slightly. I had to make two seprate boards,  the 
sweep is on a smaller daughter board-both using perf board.  

I hate it when that excitement starts setting in! It  usually means days 
without sleep. 

BTW, I don't  think I would want 30 of any given board, all at once anyway, 
but would want  them available to others--they can order their  own(?) 


The next problem is power, using the  AA-8 packs is kind of poor, sometimes 
they melt down, and the life isn't long  enough. 1.2ah gel cells are good, but 
pricy. $50 just for batteries. The boxes  require a + and - supply, or two 12 
volt batteries.  

Frank-S
