<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>hey Frank,
thanks for the reply to my post. I am disabled from toxins I breathed 
at ground zero during rescue and recovery efforts, I was a first 
responder so we got the worst of it and it has left me with a lung 
disease and two heart attacks but I&#x27;m not handicaped I have total 
mobility I just have to take it easy. So as you may see I have alot of 
time for experimenting and have been doing evp research as well as itc 
for some time now and your box has touched a special cord with me it 
just feels like I should have and be using one. Don&#x27;t ask me to explain 
it&#x27;s just this wierd feeling like something is telling me you are meant 
to use this tool. If you can ever see your way clear as to building one 
for me I would be more than glad to pay for your time labor and 
materials and would be forever appreciative.

your friend 
Bruce Halliday</pre>
