Instead I approach it as I am the researcher, I am the student, I am learning. \n   \n  I no longer waste my time talking to people who interfere or have a negative approach to the results we all get. I would much rather spend my few hours of free time talking to you guys or conducting more experiments.\n   \n  I know it can be hard to ignore negativity but if you do not ignore it then you yourself can become part of that negativity or be consumed by it entirely. So share, but do not react to negative feedback...enlighten but do not seek to impress.\n   \n  You are doing fine I see you uploaded a bunch of files I see some have personal details...is this proof for Y O U...thats what is important.
