Ralph,
 
Mike and lisa have been my tech's since I have started doing box =
research.
 
Over time you build a relationship with your tech or in my case=
 tech's like you would 
with a new friend here in the physical.
 
Early on =
in my research I had asked a series of questions pertaining to mike and Lis=
a's background in the 
physical. I was told that mike died in 1995 from exc=
essive blood loss and lisa died in 1912 from choking.
 
they then changed t=
he subject and never broached it again. My theory on the reason for this is=
 that
a spirit contact wants to remain in our thoughts and emotions as a hi=
gher being to develop a certain ammount of trust
being sight unseen. So to =
give us all the details of there physical life or even their last name, tha=
t could allow us to
gather information on who they where while in the physi=
cal and that in our minds would put them on an even level with us.
 
So the=
 thoughts and feelings of there being superior spiritual entities would fad=
e.

r the researchers ????




Hi everyone,I have been hearing the word " Purpl=
e " alot lately in my sessions.Does anyone in the group know what it pertai=
ns to ? It's been bugging me alot. Could that be a special group on their s=
ide ? I have no clue. Also has anyone questioned the voices if they have a =
last name ? All I hear on the RS boxes are first names and haven't recieved=
 anyone telling me their last name. Does Mike and Lisa have a last name ? D=
id anyone here ever ask the question " Are you Demonic Spirits ? " What was=
 their reply if any ? I did one time and got a response saying " All of us =
are ". Don't know whether I believe that Spirit or not. Probably a Joker sa=
ying that. I have asked for specific people for them to find so I could tal=
k to and got an answer " We're looking. " Then I never heard from them afte=
r that. I'm still waiting to be contacted by Telephone so far nothing yet. =
They make me laugh sometimes. I had the RS-12-469 on the one day I was just=
 listening to what they were chatting about. I found my daughters old Fart =
Machine and was playing with it while the RS radio was running to see if it=
 still works which it did. All of a sudden after I made it " Toot " I heard=
 a female voice say " Phew !!! ."LOL, I guess she thought I really passed o=
ne. Also, the other day I was on the RS 12-469 and I said " Hello Lisa how =
are you doing today ? " Then a few seconds later I hear a female voice say =
" Bruce ? " like she thought that I was Bruce talking to her. I told her no=
 it's me Ralph from Harrisburg,PA she replied "Oh, okay fine. " I hear all =
the time voices calling for Lisa she must be a very Popular Technician. Oh =
well I guess it was more than one question LOL. Hey you all take care and "=
 Keep the Sweep " a new slogan for here LOL. just kidding. You all have a g=
reat day.Regards,Ralph the Ghost Hunter
