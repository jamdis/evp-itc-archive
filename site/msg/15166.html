<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Misty, could I send you the file &quot;come to the fair.....someone said&quot; ? I haven&#x27;t uploaded it here because it is so very low audio (sorta) but with your &quot;water&quot; filters you might have what is needed BEFORE it is amplified. I would like to send it as a WAV file so you can receive the most information. In wav format it is 511kb. I can hear it pretty good...but I am in question as to if the little girl actually says &quot;someone&quot; OR &quot;some woman&quot; said. You can do any enhancements that you might think will bring out the audio. If you have time. Thanks. Jim H</pre>
