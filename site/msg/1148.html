hmm ok ya had me all the way up til roaches, now im on board, got the oars, and I am rowing the boat your way LOL
   
  They have those giant palmetto bugs down here and tis the season and they are basically a roach that flies right at ya out of the blue... and note to all...if one flies at me and you are in my way I WILL run you over. So you could say it makes my skin turn green and I'd still raise my hand to be test dummy rofl
   
  Sounds cool Ken cant wait to hear more details. And the other benefits are amazing. I think perhaps that relates slightly to what we spoke about recently, the energy field and the healing sun couch.
   
  The chinese call it Chi, some people call it the chakras, I call it the soul energy field. I think some are able to tap into use of this field at will, moving it, influencing with it. It has resonance with the body but is not fully contained in it. Accupuncture applies needles to certain points in the body which focuses the energy field and unblocks it when needed. A bit like small antennas to resonate or act as recievers?

  the whole secret is to leave micropower radio-evp running and getting mostly radio cross talk for hours days or weeks.  eventually it drenches the surroundings wiyh "something"
   
  people start commenting on how fresh the air smells in the house.  mild actinic irritation to eyes and suntan without sun.  clogged earwax liquifies and drains out , hearing improves proportionately.
   
  foliage (green) and SOME car taillights(red) seem very intensely colored
   
  pest insects disappear from house (roaches,flies,mosquitoes) traditionally "fortunate" bugs move in (crickets spiders)
   
  acute arthritic symptoms vanish and stay vanished till you leave the house for 4 to 6 hrs then begin returning IN THE EXACT REVERSE OF THE ORDER THEY APPEARED
  some APPARENT rejuvenation effects after prolonged exposure but CERTAINLY no negative effects
  effects are detectable in entire area covered by one electric power meter
  etc,etc,etc,etc 
   
   
  no qualms about signing my name to it either
   
  dont know yet how to hook it to frank box.
