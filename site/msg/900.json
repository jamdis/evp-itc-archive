In particular they can make use of \ncertain instruments to propel thier voice across. So last night I \nplayed a short clip of Joe Satriani&#39;s &quot;always with you always with \nme&quot; it contains music only, no vocals. I discovered that in the first \nfew seconds of the clip the voices were able to sustain a loud, \ncomprehensive line of communication until Satriani kicked it into \nhigh gear and the guitar notes were too loud and drowned everything \nout. Some could be heard on regular playback, most could be heard \nclearer at a slowed down rate of -74% & -30%. I then did a session \nwith no music. Both sessions lasted under 1 minute and both sessions \nhad a yeild of about 18 clips/sentences. The difference being that \nmore of the music clips were louder and clearer to understand for me \nand hopefully for you too. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Heres a few of the evp clips for you to download and evaluate. \nMany are very loud so I recommend you lower the sound DOWN... ALOT \ntil you play it once to see what volume level it has. I use stereo \nspeakers so I am used to blasting my head off LOL so careful you dont \nblow a speaker or your eardrums. Even I usually turn them down \nbecause the level of vibration and noise may be too much for my dogs \nears. The process I used was the same, p1 filter only, amped at +15 \nwhich works differently depending on what comes across and what I \nused for background sound. When using music the noise level is \ndefinitely alot higher and you will need to lower your sound for \nthose LOL\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Only sharing some of the ones I think others can hear. The music \nsession had alot more than the nonmusic session. I will send a short \nclip of satriani (the first part where the voices were the best) so \nthat if anyone wants to give it a try they can.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Misty\n&gt;    \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Check out the all-new Yahoo!
