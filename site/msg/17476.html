Thanks for the pointer - it sounds interesting.

My understanding of this i=
dea is that there are weird things along those lines that happen with indiv=
idual atoms and below that level.=C2=A0 But this does not apply (has never =
been observed) in normal life.=C2=A0 For instance, all the quantum theories=
 or disbelief in the world is not going to save us=C2=A0 if we lie down in =
traffic.=C2=A0 :)

      Frank did have a point there. There is some schools of th=

I am not sure how much of it I agree with, but there is some tr=

If you have not seen =
this movie, I can recommend it. Even of you don't agree with all of it, it =
does give you some interesting food for thought.

Fiona,

Sorry to butt in, but I'm curious. If this is happeni=
