Mike Coletta, I am forwarding you a note of Correspondence I have had with =
David od Spirit Lab.
=A0
He has done some experiments with EMF and EVP.
=A0=

I dont have an EMF reader, but for those of you that do have one, have you=
 run it against radios/devices that appear to get better EVP than other rad=
ios/devices.
=A0
I wonder of Hgh EVP is the catalyst that makes EVP capture=
 possible

LOL=85.Mike=
,
You will always have noise. The trick is lifting the EVP out of the noise=
 floor. The radio thing clouds the findings, as it can be anything but para=
normal, and there is no way to differentiate. I have thought about this for=
 years, and there is just no way to confirm any findings as genuine. Too ma=
ny people can set you up even without your knowledge. Like I suggested, RF =
spectrum analysis is vital to eliminating any man made RF. Using the proces=
s to speak by a dead person is a violation of physics. There are explainati=
ons that are allowable under QM and those are the ones I am pursuing as the=
y have the best chance of being accepted by the scientific community.

David, this is my second note. I just now read your wri=
te up on EMF. I have cc two of my peers who have same interests. FYI=A0=A0=
=A0=A0=A0=A0 http://www.spinvestigations.org/EMF-EVP-CORRELATOR.pdf

=A0

I=
 have been thinking about this too, and I kinda think what you are doing he=
re is trying to find what has been bugging me no end. The catalyst that may=
 I say enhances a deceased person's message loud enough that the recorder c=
an pick it up. Correct me if I am wrong.

=A0

Traditional EVP I understand=
 is capturing spirit messages on a recorder. 

=A0

But with what I and oth=
ers call EVP-Radio, EVP that is captured using lets say AM radio in scan/sw=
eep mode, the common explanation for this as noted in my first note, is the=
 spirits somehow form messages from the speech fragments in the radio sweep=
.

=A0

Intuitively I dont want to believe that.=A0 

=A0

I could be wrong=
, but I believe there is something that occurs in that radio sweep that is =
providing EVP the ability to be captured on recorder.

=A0

In your researc=
h, have you taken a radio like mine, for example, the Radio Shack model 12-=
469 - hacked, and set it up for sweep, and then check to see what the EMF r=
eadings are?=A0 And then take a digital recorder and check to see what the =
EMF readings are?

=A0

If the radio in sweep mode is generating=A0 more EM=
F than the digital recorder alone, then that may be what what is enhancing =
the EVP to be captured. Now I feel like Doc Brown on Back to the Future..

=
=A0

I am really fascinated with your work!

=A0

So, if that is true, then=
 how does anyone build a device to capture joyously good quality EVP minus =
radio traffic?

=A0

I would love to have a device like that for my missing=
 person cases. I am spending way too much time weeding our radio traffic fr=
om my recordings with victims for good leads, but if a radio free device ca=
n be built, that would be awesome!..

=A0

David, please comment if you hav=
e tested the radio sweep hacks, mini boxes, and recorders each alone to see=
 what the EMF readings are as that may very well be what allows for good qu=
ality EVP to be captured on recorder.
