Wisteria,
=A0
Years ago while in meditation I heard that voice for the firs=
t time, and she yelled at me, and I could heard her foot steps very out lou=
d. In that time I didn't use my cell, I have using my cell just 2 months, t=
o record voices or do EVP.
I can't hear them without my cell, just in that =
occasion (4 years ago) I heard that woman, that I know perfectly that was a=
 spirit, or at least it seemed that. (maybe I'm wrong)
=A0
And about my cel=
l voice insutling me, I think it was my subconscious mind that projected my=
 past thoughts and were caught by my cell. But just in that occasion. 
=A0

Normally they call my name, or I know that the message is for me, we have t=
o use the intuition sometimes.
=A0
I always prove the info that they give, =
and its very accurate.
