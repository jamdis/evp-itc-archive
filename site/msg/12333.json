This \ngroup has limited space and all files are subject to deletion to make \nroom. For those who would like to post larger files or multiple files \nyou can make use of esnips.com for file sharing. Once uploaded you can \nsimply post the link to your files just as it does when you upload \nhere. Esnips is free and they give you 50 gb of space and allow \nmultiple file formats as well as larger files. The yahoo group only \nallows 100 mb for the ENTIRE group to share so posting rules had to be \nimplemented.\n\nMisty"}
