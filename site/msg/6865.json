Since doing the research, have you noticed an increase\n&gt; in your &quot;intuitive&quot; senses?  By that I mean, has your hearing been\n&gt; heightened to the point of hearing conversations when you are alone? \n&gt; Or seeing things more clearly spirit wise?  Or am I just nuts and need\n&gt; to be committed?  \n&gt; \n&gt; I had to ask.  It&#39;s a very strange thing.  These things have been\n&gt; happening to me and I&#39;m wondering if you have experienced the same\n&gt; thing or close to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeremy\n&gt;"}
