If you want one, you have to cough up $400-$500, just\n&gt; &gt; like I just did. That fee alone is enough to deter casual users. The\n&gt; &gt; people who buy these are not going to buy them on a whim.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Nov 24, 2007, at 12:07 AM, Frank Sumption wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s not that concerns are not considered, I think no one knows\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what to do with it. There&#39;s not enough box users, and ITC\n&gt; &gt; &gt; researchers out there to really good feel for what the pitfalls\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are. So far after seven years of EVP/ITC work I can say onlly that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; these dark entities, or wahtever it is talk bad, and threaten, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that&#39;s about all they do. They threaten, I tell them to bring it,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and....nothin&#39;! Paper tigers I say.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as some fears that portals are opened, and all kinds of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evil comes in, I don&#39;t believe that either. They are already have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; full access, they already exist in more demensions, making this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; physical level about the lowest level of spiritual existence/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evolution. Just about all these worries are old fear crap to keep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people in church.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to with hold the stuff cuz of a few nut\n&gt; &gt; &gt; jobs, you have the same problem with everything from bicycles to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; airplanes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I had that concern about selling my boxes, but how would you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; screen users? You can&#39;t. Not everyone can use a quija board, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not too many unbalanced ding dongs get in trouble with those  \n&gt; anyway.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: babiarz3@...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Fri, 23 Nov 2007 19:58:45 +0000\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Family hour around the radio\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am a fairly quiet person, most of the time. I have my  \n&gt; thoughts and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; opinions on topics but feel strongly about &quot;to each his own&quot;.  \n&gt; Unless\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something strikes me as completely wrong, I won&#39;t debate. No  \n&gt; one here\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has heard from me other than recently with this mini-box yet, I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; here several times weekly reading and offering my energy in  \n&gt; support of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the research.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However...something is striking me here and again, I can&#39;t keep my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mouth shut. The discussion about the family hour with the box  \n&gt; has led\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the way for people to mention negativity and even &quot;the dark  \n&gt; guys&quot; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be fun if not taken seriously.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I ask you to consider the fact that many who purchase the mini-box\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will not be of the right frame of mind. Most will not be in  \n&gt; harmony.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many will take &quot;the dark guys&quot; seriously. Yet, you feel it&#39;s a  \n&gt; good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; idea to let anyone who wants a box have one? All in the name of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sharing technology.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I know that my previous posts expressing my concern over the mass\n&gt; &gt; &gt; marketing of the box, was barely given consideration. Realize  \n&gt; that I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; am not being selfish- I do not own a box. EVP is my passion and  \n&gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been from day one 6 years ago when I jumped fully into the  \n&gt; field. I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; successful in capturing EVP, always have been. I still do it  \n&gt; the &quot;old\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fashioned way&quot; with open air techniques. Would I love to be  \n&gt; able to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hold real time 2 way communications with the other side? Of  \n&gt; course.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I do not think enough research into the possibilities has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been done to warrant the approval let alone production of these  \n&gt; boxes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Those of us who have been on countless investigations with many  \n&gt; people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will quickly admit that there are some people we&#39;d rather not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; investigate with. When they are present, negative things tend to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happen. We all know one or two people who we can say &quot;felt  \n&gt; dark&quot; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the first meeting. We all admit that being mentally sound is an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; important quality in this field. If you have mental issues,  \n&gt; this may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not be the area of research for you. We don&#39;t bring children on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; investigations for obvious reasons. BUT! If you want a box that  \n&gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possibly open up a portal and bridge the gap between here and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dark, sure! Anyone who wants one should have it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You might feel that I am over reacting or being overly dramatic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s fine. My concern is not what you think of me but that you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consider the possibilities here. Many of which we do not know.  \n&gt; Can you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be 100% sure that this is a good idea or that it&#39;s worthy of  \n&gt; saying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;well, we&#39;ll see what happens&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bill,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You have the right idea, I recently have dealt with a lot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of negativity from my Frank&#39;s box.
