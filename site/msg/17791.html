<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I missed the original post on the PCB, or couldn&#x27;t find it. Anyway, I use a company called ExpressPCB  http://www.expresspcb.com/ $60 for 3 their of mini boards. I can fit all functions minus the tuner on a mini board. I use SMT with the mini boards, and theat&#x27;s not difficult using 1206 components. mouser carries all the SMT parts.

 But mostly I use perf board and use the money I would have spent on PCBs for parts. 

 I did find a schematic for the function generator kit others have been using for sweep, and converted to use the LM324, 1N4148 diodes and added a DC offset and amp. I made a board to see how the sine wave functions as sweep instead of the triangle wave.

&gt; i wonder if there is a way to get a copy of a pre eched board to iron it onto a new pcb.

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m an electrical engineer and also a radio amateur so I make a lot of pc
&gt; &gt; boards, both at work and at home.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yes, that board should work. If you have a single-sided board pattern, after
&gt; &gt; you&#x27;ve developed the photoresist (or ironed on the toner, if you do it that
&gt; &gt; way) spray the other side of the board with spray paint and let dry. I like
&gt; &gt; to use the clear coat paint but it doesn&#x27;t really matter.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; After you&#x27;ve etched one side, clean the paint and the photoresist off (clean
&gt; &gt; both sides) with acetone, MEK, etc. Do this in a well-ventilated area! Then
&gt; &gt; drill your holes.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you are going to make a double-sided board, drill a few of the holes that
&gt; &gt; have common pads on both sides to orient the pattern on the other side and
&gt; &gt; repeat whatever method you use to put a resist on that side. After it&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; developed/ironed on, spray the already etched side with paint and etch the
&gt; &gt; other side. Clean off the board and drill holes.

&gt; &gt; &gt;   hay thanks zack where do you fine that stuff.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  what i have now is a two sided copper clad board (not sensitize)  will it
&gt; &gt; &gt; work with that as well? Would hate to wast them.
