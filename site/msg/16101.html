<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I tend to agree regarding the definitions of beliefs. There seems to be a continuum: at each end are people with closed minds who operate from a dogma of philosophy and beliefs. In each case their positions are relatively unshakable. One end is the staunch believer and the other end is what I and others have come to call the &#x27;pseudoskeptic&#x27;. It is this latter type of person who often labels themselves a &#x27;skeptic&#x27; and who tries to argue from what they term positions of &#x27;logic&#x27;, say they are &#x27;critical thinkers&#x27; and demand &#x27;evidence&#x27; placing their faith in their version of &#x27;science&#x27;. All of these terms are of their own definition and are maleable depending on the situation. In the center of this spectrum are what I think of as the true and only &#x27;open-minded critical thinkers&#x27;. I suppose one could label these individuals as &#x27;skeptics&#x27; but this kind of clouds the issue. I am sad to say that I really believe the size of this third group is well under 1/3 of everyone. Just my opinion of course.

&gt; In my mind the word &quot;skeptic&quot; is a misnomer. There is a difference between a
&gt; skeptic and an unbeliever.
&gt; 
&gt; If I said &quot;I&#x27;m skeptical about your rebuilding that engine&quot; I would admit
&gt; that it&#x27;s possible, just doubt that you&#x27;re going to do it.  An unbeliever
&gt; wouldn&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s even possible to rebuild engines.
&gt; 
&gt; I think most of the &quot;skeptics&quot; we see in any sort of paranormal sphere are
&gt; really unbelievers. As Frank pointed out, they don&#x27;t even believe or
&gt; recognize that we ARE spirits, so how could a ghost exist and how could the
&gt; box work? A ghost could hit them in the head with a 2X4 and they still
&gt; wouldn&#x27;t believe it.

&gt; &gt; Not to mention that when they want to &quot;test&quot; something they are already
&gt; &gt; skeptical about, then they will come up with impossible criteria. The day I
&gt; &gt; finally stopped caring why a ghost box worked and just accepted that it did
&gt; &gt; was the start of rewarding sessions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think most of us are beyond the point where skeptics can make a dent in
&gt; &gt; our searching for answers. Skepticism can be good, but sometimes it can be
&gt; &gt; self defeating. More people just want to make a name for themselves by
&gt; &gt; trying to be the one that brought down this or that device. If they would
&gt; &gt; try some of these methods with an open mind and a brief suspension of
&gt; &gt; disbelief, then they might get their own rewarding experiences as well...

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well then, just build youself a box and test the hell out of it!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve said all along that one has to be careful not to create the
&gt; &gt; voices/answers one wants to hear. We are, despite appearances, spirit, and
&gt; &gt; we can create our own spirit voices just as easy as any other entity. But
&gt; &gt; what do I know, I just make the damn boxes and I don&#x27;t even believe in ghost
&gt; &gt; hunting!?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Whatever these brainiacs claim that want to do all this testing--they
&gt; &gt; never-ever ask the freaking inventors! They can&#x27;t even get their heads
&gt; &gt; around EVPmaker, so pretend that doesn&#x27;t even exist, even though the box
&gt; &gt; came later. Probably they think it would be easier to disprove the box. Some
&gt; &gt; duffus puts a DR. in front of his name and I&#x27;m supposed to be impressed, it
&gt; &gt; just means all intellect has been programmed out. After all , they &quot;know&quot;
&gt; &gt; there are no spirits, so it has to be something else--anything else!
