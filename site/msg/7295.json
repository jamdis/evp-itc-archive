In the 1980s, a Luxembourg couple, Maggy Harsch-\nFischbach and Jules Fischbach, began experimenting with \nelectromagnetic tape.  They were contacted by ethereal beings who \ncalled themselves The Seven, part of a fraternity called the Rainbow \nPeople, who were interested in facilitating interdimensional \ncommunication.  The Seven work in Time Stream, a collaboration of \nnonhuman beings and the human dead willing to work with the human \nliving to form a bridge across realities.  Key to the success of this \ncommunication, they said, is the consciousness and purity of motives \nof the living researchers. &quot;\n\nhttp://www.visionaryliving.com/articles/otherside.php\n\nLC\nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com"}
