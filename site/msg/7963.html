I heard that.  Do what you want.  Life to short, play hard, and have fun.  Do what make you happy!

capable of creating these voices, conciously, or unconciously.

These boxes are all made by hand, and are exceedingly tedious to 
make. I get a bit burned out giving these things to people who want 
to parade the damn things all over the country, instead of just using 
it. It really torques my jaws to have some bozo proclaiming himslef a 
great medium while he's standing on my head!

There's too many other methods and systems out there that work, 
sometimes as well, sometimes better, than the so called box. That's 
why I don't feel obligated to drop everything, and spend every waking 
moment building boxes to give away. While, I might add, not having 
time to solve any of the problems with the stupid things.

And yeah, I hear the Steve voices too, and am unable to bend it 
around in my mind to say anything else, and I have tried! That 
doesn't mean it's God talking, and it's certainly not one of the 
sisters. That also doesn't mean I completely rule out the possiblity!

As I say, allow the force(spirit)to provide the answer.
