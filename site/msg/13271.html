<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Oh ok.  I didn&#x27;t realize is was just some ocmments at that site,
rather than a more formal study.  So thanks anyways.  If you come up
with the reference though, I&#x27;d be happy to check it out.

&gt; Interesting - do you have a link to that blind test? 
&gt; I&#x27;d like to learn more about their methodology.

&gt; Sounds good. Count me in on the test. By the way, some here might
be interested in knowing that the American Association of EVP did a
similar blind test and their results showed about a 33% hit rate for
people getting the same words from a file. That would be a pretty
good number to match, I would think. Sarcasum can be an effective way
to make things happen at times.And that&#x27;s not being sarcastic.

&gt; Reading the posts from the last week as I do every sat morning it is my 
&gt; opinion that some of them have a very polite condescending tone to 
&gt; them.This group and the people in it have always been very helpful and 
&gt; a joy to do research with I hope it stays that way I would hate to see 
&gt; it become one of &quot;those&quot; boards if you know what I mean (my 1 cent had 
&gt; to do it). so anyway
&gt; One productive idea that I saw from one of this weeks posts was to send 
&gt; the same file privitly to a few people and see what they hear in it. 
&gt; Unpromtide by file names or other posts about it. I have a couple files 
&gt; that I feel are pretty clear. So if you would like to volunteer just 
&gt; send me an email with your email adress and I will send you a file not 
&gt; too long but it will be unedited and in its original form.
&gt; I will not amplify it or edit or change it in anyway from its original. 
&gt; Those who recive the files do the same NO editing untill you render 
&gt; your opinion to me about it after that you can do what u like with it.
&gt; Remember after listening email me DO NOT post what you hear on the 
&gt; board I will do that later when I have everyones opinion.
