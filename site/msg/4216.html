<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, you did what you needed to do--you spoke to him and you told  
him what you believe to be true. Now just let it go. I know you&#x27;re  
mad, but when you calm some, and breathe some, I think you&#x27;ll feel  
better for having confronted him.

I think our discussions--some heated--on this list over the last few  
weeks have purged us of the need to argue about he said/he said  
issues concerning the boxes. We know they work. Let&#x27;s just move on in  
positive direction.

&gt;  After a long discussion, and at times a yelling match with Chris

&gt; basically I think it came down to he said-she said type deal. I  
&gt; could agree with some of what Mr Moon said, but the bottom line is-- 
&gt; I don&#x27;t care! I have had enough of these endless pissing contests,  
&gt; one person telling me one thing, someone else telling me something  
&gt; else. I&#x27;m not wise enough to tell who is telling the truth. I&#x27;m  
&gt; done, I&#x27;m not discussing this stuff anymore, I&#x27;m not making boxes  
&gt; anymore. I have absolutely no interest in the so called paranormal.  
&gt; I don&#x27;t sell this shit, I don&#x27;t make any money, all it does eat all  
&gt; my time and piss me off. I&#x27;ll finish this last box I&#x27;m working on,  
&gt; and that&#x27;s it. No more e-mails, no more discussion--I have had it!
&gt;
&gt;  Mr Moon said he would be glad to come on the group and answer  
&gt; question--so there ya go, now is your chance. I&#x27;m not going to be  
&gt; the go between, nor will I participate.
