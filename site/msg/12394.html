<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ya know, after thinking about the comment, the one point I can agree
on is that a person should be of a responsible, generally positive
mindset. More of a common sense thing, I could agree that box research
isn&#x27;t meant for everyone nor is it everyone&#x27;s cup of tea. Reckless use
can bring negative results and that is a very real possibility, so
definately not for the faint of heart.

That being said, the training issue boils down to a user&#x27;s intent and
responsibility to learn and take precaution. And I didn&#x27;t even need 30
qualified operators to tell me that, lol. BTW, blind leading the
greedy comment....epic :D

thanks, 
Andy

&gt; Last night on Haunted Times Magazine radio , guest Brian Harnois (Ghost
&gt; Hunters International) told the radio listening audience that he didn&#x27;t
&gt; think anyone should use a Franks&#x27; Box, (or a ghost box is what he was
&gt; insinuating) unless they had training from Christopher Moon.
&gt; So... that is the topic of my blog write-up this morning if you care to
&gt; read it.
