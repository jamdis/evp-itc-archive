<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hmmm. This could very well be, Bruce. (And thanks to everyone who has  
replied--all great ideas and suggestions.) I heard seven again today  
and every time I did, I asked, &quot;Who is Seven?&quot; but got no  
distinguishable reply. I&#x27;ll keep trying. :)

&gt; Hi Ann,
&gt;
&gt; I am a little late with this reply. I went back over some older  
&gt; files that I remembered mentioned the number seven
&gt; and it was at a time when I was engrossed with Mark Macy&#x27;s book  
&gt; &quot;Miracles in the storm&quot; It was the biography of the original time  
&gt; stream
&gt; team and ITC researchers such as Macy,hersch-fischbach,george meek  
&gt; and sarah estep. Macy lists communications from  higher (angelic)
&gt; entities that referred to themselves as the seven. they where the  
&gt; guardians of spirit to earth communication and oversaw all aspects  
&gt; of it.
&gt;
&gt; I had received messages during the time of reading this book and  
&gt; asking questions during sessions about the seven and the circle of  
&gt; light.
&gt;
&gt; I believe your guides may be trying to tell you to do some research  
&gt; into the origins of what we are doing to better understand the  
&gt; gravity of it.
&gt; And I also believe it is a warning for us not to let happen to us  
&gt; the same thing that brought an end to that fantastic communication  
&gt; given to
&gt; those original researchers. You see they where cut off from that  
&gt; advanced communication due to a disharmony among them from jealousy,
&gt; envy and a need for recognition.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m sure they do not want us to fall into the same trap, I believe  
&gt; that this is our second chance.

&gt; 7 is my lucky number. 7 is important to me in many things in my life
