  Derek,

  Remember that old maxim "Thoughts are things!" Doesn't h=
ave to be religious in nature. One may just have to wish to help another sp=
irit out by offering positive thinking. Also, it is possible to sent though=
ts to the spirit that are supportive in nature. The Universe will take your=
 intent and transfer your intent to the spirit. that intent will become act=
ionable by the spirit. Call it another form of spirit rescue, if you like. =


  Not everything in this Universe has to be measured in religious terms! =
Has more to do with one's own deep sense of Spirituality than religion.

  I've noticed this type of message is a constant theme within EVP =
transmissions.

  I am intrigued by the "robotic" voice, this could support=
 the holographic universe theory:

  I think it's worth approaching this field with a mind to helping those r=
equesting assitance. 

  But what does helping mean ? 
  Perhaps prayer or =
for those of an agnostic nature postive thoughts focused on the recipent do=
 have a tangeble effect, our "materialistic" nature may give a form of heav=
y duty thought energy which for those on the other side can effect "real wo=
