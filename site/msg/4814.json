My 12-469 is sitting in the corner and i&#39;ll probably\n&gt; never touch it again because that constant pulse noise is very\n&gt; distracting to get past to hear any audible messages. That&#39;s just my\n&gt; personal opinion anyway for what it&#39;s worth. If you listen to my\n&gt; radio shack files from today you will hear the difference between the\n&gt; two boxes. The sweep between the two are both linear, but one has\n&gt; the pulse sound and one is just a clean sweep without the pulse. Ask\n&gt; your local radio shack if they have any 12-470 older style models,\n&gt; they are gray with a white top and also has a built in speaker. The\n&gt; new 470 is all black and can&#39;t be modified as of yet but i think Mike\n&gt; C. could figure it out if he didn&#39;t have 500 other projects going at\n&gt; the same time....lol Any questions just shoot me an e-mail and i\n&gt; will help the best i can.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;babiarz3&quot; &lt;babiarz3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Steve, hope your holidays were wonderful.

You are still choosing one channel and it is still a linear sweep\n&gt; &gt; right? Technically, what would be the difference in choosing AM on\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; 469 and AM on the 470?

Hey babs, i think you\n&gt; should\n&gt; &gt; &gt; give the RS box a little time and maybe you will start to get\n&gt; stuff.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Although i have a 12-469 also and it really sux compared to the\n&gt; 12-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 470. The constant pulsing noise in the 469 model just drives me\n&gt; crazy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough to not concentrate. Try looking for an older style model\n&gt; of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 12-470, that&#39;s probably the best radio i own hands down. Instant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; results always and consistently. All my boxes work, but they are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; finicky sometimes.
