onse is for Mike E. but will benifit all new researchers

                M=
ike,
 
Yes I have spoken to my father, grandmother and a number of aunts, u=
ncles and friends.
When you become a box researcher and begin to do session=
s, your box or any box
when it is turned on, opens a direct line of communi=
cation, A doorway if you will
between our side and the spirit world is esta=
blished in order to facilitate the conditions
we need to create real time c=
ommunication.
 
For that reason we are assigned what the spirit communicato=
rs themselves call technicians.
What a technician is , is a spirit that is =
assigned especially to you as a researcher and my
theory is based on commun=
ications over many sessions with my techs. It is based on harmony of energy=
 and spirit
between yourself and your technician. The tech acts as a modera=
tor or go between for your communication sessions
guarding that open doorwa=
y and assisting in any way that is needed to help get your communications a=
cross and
the responses that you receive will either come through him or he=
r, or your tech will help facilitate communication
between another spirit a=
nd the researcher.
 
On your next session ask about your tech and if you ha=
ve been assigned one, if so what is their name. 
If you have been getting a=
 name that has been coming through consistently that is probably your tech.=

As you become more experienced and over the course of many sessions, like =
any other person you deal with on a regular basis
you will develop a relati=
onship with him or her. The stronger your bond becomes the better your comm=
unication will get.
Also a very important factor in strong communication is=
 state of attitude, to have strong and beneficial communication you need to=
 approach 
a session with a positive and open attitude. Good vibrations str=
engthen the bridge, negative vibrations weaken it and attract negative ener=
gy.
 
I have been involved in the paranormal in one sense or another for al=
most ten years. I started as a field investigator and progressed to the poi=
nt I am at today.
When I discovered real time spirit communication, or box =
research it was still in it's infancy. the only box being used by only a co=
uple of individuals was Frank's box
through contacts I made I became acquai=
nted with Mr. Sumption and was lucky enough to receive a Frank's box #12 Al=
so at that time Joe's box had been established 
and I received one of those=
 and started my research. At that time there where only about three of us t=
at where doing continuous research and stumbling around
Trying to figure ou=
t what, when, why and how! but that's what led us to helping develop the co=
mmunication. And eventually learn enough to be able to help 
others that be=
come interested in becoming box researchers.
 
As far as conducting your se=
ssions, you are only just starting out. You need time and our friends on th=
e other side need time to get to know each other.
Each of us has our own un=
ique spiritual energy and like someone that joins say a softball team just =
as an example. you will be treated cautiously but it will take time to get =

familiar with your team mates and become an accepted member of the team.
S=
tart with short common questions and comments and expect short and sometime=
s no response in the beginning. that is not due to their lack of wanting to=
 communicate
but like I said it takes time to build that bond and make the =
channels of communication strong and reliable. Ask basic questions that wil=
l most likely result in you hearing 
and understanding the answers in real =
time, this will not only develop your confidence as a researcher but also g=
ive you the personal validation that we all need to know
that in fact we ar=
e communicating.
 
AND record everything!! I can't stress that enough. In t=
he beginning until your ear is developed for filtering out the communicatio=
n from the crap, you will need to
refer back to the recording to confirm wh=
at you believe you heard.
 
I hope this helps.

Bruce, have you been able to contact your personal friends and family memb=
