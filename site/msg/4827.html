<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Now I am sure you arent aware of who I am being, noone else other 
than misty welcomed me to this group. Being I am not professional at 
e.v.p.s but yet have gone through listening to many of them from 
trustful resources, your e.v.p.s make me a bit leery. NOt trying to 
be rude, so dont go get all upset right off the bat. In your e.v.p.s, 
this one especially, alot of them sound like you, not the part where 
you asking questions, but where your dad is supposively answering 
you. NOw everyone has their own right to opinion so there is now need 
to get defensive, if all is real there would be nothing to get mad 
about. I just cant help but notice how odd it is that your e.v.p. 
questions to your father, seems to answer right away when you ask the 
question. Also, i notice that after you ask the question i hear 
something being turned on that has contains the answer to that 
question. Whether it be your dad or not. I feel its you that is 
answering, but let me tell you why i figure this.. and please you 
would like to defend you side of things that would be great, maybe i 
would be able to change my opinion on the matter. But as of now, 
e.v.p.s are usually done on the same tape that the questions are on, 
then in a rewind you can hear you and the e.v.p. but to me it sound 
like you put the e.v.p. response on another tape. i am not trying to 
start any kind of fight or be cruel, maybe i could learn something on 
behalf of how you do your work... thank you</pre>
