<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bill, 
I too can be idealistic and am usually dumbfounded by some of the
things that happen within the paranormal community. But, for whatever
reason, I am not idealistic when it comes to the possibilities of the
distribution of the box to whoever has the money to pay for one.
IMO, this reeks of money over-riding responsibility. This is a huge
step-forward in our field and I applaud the research and abilities
being shown. 
Like absolutely attracts like. And, as we all know, egos abound in
this field. The energies present when the box is turned on has a huge
effect on who comes through. I know this to be true.
Now, I don&#x27;t have a proposed answer to my dilemma. I do not know how
to regulate the people who purchase. The only answer I can come up
with is time. Time to fully research the possibilities. The possible
psychological effect on untrained users, scares me. And although I get
that the onus of responsibility ultimately falls on the owner of the
box, I can&#x27;t help but feel the responsibility falls on all of us. True
professionalism, I believe, would have the builders and distributers
testing the units over a period of time, at the very least. I&#x27;m pretty
sure Frank didn&#x27;t call everyone on day one.

&gt; Hello all, although I didn&#x27;t anticipate the direction this thread has
&gt; gone, it is an important subject. There are those in the physical and
&gt; non-physical planes that do not have the best intentions. It is
&gt; unfortunate and sometimes I am idealistic and wish the world would be
&gt; a place where everyone can work, live, and research together. But
&gt; that&#x27;s not the way it always is.
&gt; 
&gt; I was brought up in a wonderful home where the possibility of the
&gt; existence of supernatural beings was accepted by my parents. Now,
&gt; decades later, in our home we also accept this possibility and our
&gt; kids, even though grown, are making up their own minds. The research I
&gt; do is not taken lightly but we attract those that have similar values
&gt; to our own. Even in the spirit world. This technology that Frank has
&gt; brought forth is another form of ITC, and anyone with a video camera
&gt; and tv can engage in video ITC. I don&#x27;t think it would be possible to
&gt; regulate who can have a camera and tv, just as we can&#x27;t regulate who
&gt; has access to any other technology including radios.
&gt; 
&gt; It&#x27;s more of a matter of personal responsibility instead of the means
&gt; we use to communicate.

&gt; &gt; babiarz3,
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; I believe the posts you are referring to about family hour with
the box
&gt; &gt; where written in a light manner in jest. I do not presume to speak
&gt; for anyone 
&gt; &gt; else on this group I&#x27;m sure they can speak for themselves.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; you speak of responsibility with any form of open communication, I
&gt; believe the individuals that are
&gt; &gt; studying and distributing the mini box are sufficiently experienced
&gt; and know who they should sell to and who not.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t believe they mean to put the mini box on the shelves in toys
&gt; r us. Anyone that uses a box whether it be a Frank&#x27;s box
&gt; &gt; A Joe&#x27;s box or a mini box will probably have done some research into
&gt; this method of evp and will probably have some intimate experience
&gt; &gt; with the paranormal field and if not I&#x27;m sure they will seek advice
&gt; from those of us that have that experience. There is never a lack of
&gt; advice here.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; as far as dark heads go I know through personal experience that they
&gt; can be deceiving and manipulative with someone that does not know any
&gt; better
&gt; &gt; I have a Frank&#x27;s box and a Joe&#x27;s box and do serious research on a
&gt; daily basis. My opinion is the good spirits out weigh the negative
&gt; ones and anyone
&gt; &gt; that experiments with a box will tell you that you do forge strong
&gt; bonds with what I call my spirit guides or technicians, the same two
&gt; spirits communicate 
&gt; &gt; with me during every session and protect me from negativity. As long
&gt; as I do not feed the darkies with my own negativity I am fine.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; Also I believe that the people who are distributing the mini box
&gt; have set that price to deter any average person that&#x27;s completely
&gt; ignorant of the paranormal
&gt; &gt; away from purchasing this device.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; I have never met bill personally but know of him, he is a well
&gt; respected researcher and is well aware I think of the pitfalls as well
&gt; as the rewards of box communication.
&gt; &gt; and I don&#x27;t believe he would ever endanger himself, his family or
&gt; anyone else by carelessly using the box for entertainment purposes.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; that Is my opinion for what it&#x27;s worth.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am a fairly quiet person, most of the time. I have my thoughts
&gt; andopinions on topics but feel strongly about &quot;to each his own&quot;.
&gt; Unlesssomething strikes me as completely wrong, I won&#x27;t debate. No one
&gt; herehas heard from me other than recently with this mini-box yet, I
&gt; amhere several times weekly reading and offering my energy in support
&gt; ofthe research.However...something is striking me here and again, I
&gt; can&#x27;t keep mymouth shut. The discussion about the family hour with the
&gt; box has ledthe way for people to mention negativity and even &quot;the dark
&gt; guys&quot; canbe fun if not taken seriously.I ask you to consider the fact
&gt; that many who purchase the mini-boxwill not be of the right frame of
&gt; mind. Most will not be in harmony.Many will take &quot;the dark guys&quot;
&gt; seriously. Yet, you feel it&#x27;s a goodidea to let anyone who wants a box
&gt; have one? All in the name ofsharing technology.I know that my previous
&gt; posts expressing my concern over the massmarketing of the box, was
&gt; barely given consideration. Realize that Iam not being selfish- I do
&gt; not own a box. EVP is my passion and hasbeen from day one 6 years ago
&gt; when I jumped fully into the field. I amsuccessful in capturing EVP,
&gt; always have been. I still do it the &quot;oldfashioned way&quot; with open air
&gt; techniques. Would I love to be able tohold real time 2 way
&gt; communications with the other side? Of course.However, I do not think
&gt; enough research into the possibilities hasbeen done to warrant the
&gt; approval let alone production of these boxes. Those of us who have
&gt; been on countless investigations with many peoplewill quickly admit
&gt; that there are some people we&#x27;d rather notinvestigate with. When they
&gt; are present, negative things tend tohappen. We all know one or two
&gt; people who we can say &quot;felt dark&quot; fromthe first meeting. We all admit
&gt; that being mentally sound is animportant quality in this field. If you
&gt; have mental issues, this maynot be the area of research for you. We
&gt; don&#x27;t bring children oninvestigations for obvious reasons. BUT! If you
&gt; want a box that couldpossibly open up a portal and bridge the gap
&gt; between here and thedark, sure! Anyone who wants one should have it!
&gt; You might feel that I am over reacting or being overly dramatic.That&#x27;s
&gt; fine. My concern is not what you think of me but that youconsider the
&gt; possibilities here. Many of which we do not know. Can yoube 100% sure
&gt; that this is a good idea or that it&#x27;s worthy of saying&quot;well, we&#x27;ll see
&gt; what happens&quot;? --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce
