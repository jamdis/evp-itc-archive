<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I haven&#x27;t experienced the EVP/ITC, but many cemeteries have guardians that 
try to ward you off in various ways.  From my experience, if they finally 
decide you&#x27;re not there to do harm they will kind of back off and leave 
you alone.

A simple thing like straightening a skewed tombstone or cleaning up a mess 
will convince them you&#x27;re not there to harm. Also, tell them that you&#x27;re 
not there to do damage.

&gt; Just wondering if you guys have ever experienced anything like what
&gt; I&#x27;m about to describe.
&gt;
&gt; I was doing an investigation at a cemetery the other night. My
&gt; girlfriend was using the 469 with headphones. It started to spook her
&gt; a little and she gave me the box. I put in the headphones and didn&#x27;t
&gt; hear anything out of the normal radio scan. Then I heard footsteps
&gt; circling me. I started looking around and asked if anyone else was
&gt; hearing them. I then got attacked by an entity in the cemetery. It
&gt; felt a lot like a schoolyard bully circling you before he hits you,
&gt; and then a big rush of  energy. I can&#x27;t really describe the feeling.
&gt;
&gt; Then, the other night I was on a separate investigation and was in a
&gt; bathroom. I was hearing water dripping, but when I checked the
&gt; possible sources they were bone dry.
&gt;
&gt; Is it possible that these noises can come clearly through the 469? I
&gt; do not have any psychic ability I know of. They are very real, and are
&gt; definitely happening, not being imagined. Maybe it has something to do
&gt; with the headphones? I cannot explain this. Have any of you had a
&gt; similar experience?
