<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have shown you what I did with my three modified 12-469 radios, in my 
videos I have shared on the web.  As of yesterday morning I had not 
tried my modified (older version) 12-470 yet. Well, I took it to our 
local city cemetery yesterday afternoon to see what I could get. I 
visited gravesites of people I knew had died tragically and quickly.  
They say those spirits never had a chance to express prior to being 
taken, it was just too fast.
Anyway, I just downloaded the third file and listened.  Oh my.... it 
gave me chills when I heard her voice at the last second of the 
recording.  Am I hearing what I think I am hearing?  Can someone 
confirm what is being said? (It is the last voice, I think saying three 
words just before I turned the 12-470 off.
I&#x27;ve placed the file in the folder UFO Geek Files in the file section. 
It&#x27;s named leah_ann_3.wav
Thanks!
- Mike</pre>
