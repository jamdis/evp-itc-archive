 they where hearing but some on here does ALOT...its starting to sound as i=
f they feel like they knew more then anyone and most just started doing thi=
s where..Frank,Steve and some other have been doing this for years..Some ev=
en have the nerve to try to talk done to Frank..now remember this is the ma=
n the made the box..so i just think its insulting and ignorant. I for one w=
