<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Winter vacation over! Not really a vacation, but the school district closes 
down for the holidays, plus the added snow days!! I have the two proto types 
boards complete, and funtional, at least as far as the individual sections 
go, now to test them in sessions. I must be getting older, cuz this stuff 
seems to take me forever anymore.  I kept the shortwave converter, and I 
think I have a version that works better. I think I&#x27;ll order three more of 
the micro boards, and combine those with home made radios to get some more 
systems put together quicker.  I had three systems that I made using all 
surface mount components, and they were the most stable systems so far, and 
the most compact. I gave the first ones away, DOH!
