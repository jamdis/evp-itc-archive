Their Koestler Parapsychology Unit hosts considerable psi-related\n&gt; research.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * Hertfordshire - Professor Richard Weisman researches luck and\n&gt; paranormal-related phenomena at the University of Hertfordshire.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; USA\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * Arizona - The Center for Consciousness Studies at the University of\n&gt; Arizona offers many courses that focus on issues related to alternative and\n&gt; paranormal studies. These include web-based courses as well as on-campus\n&gt; resources.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * New Jersey - Princeton University takes a slightly different approach\n&gt; with Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR), with a focus on the\n&gt; &quot;Scientific Study of Consciousness-Related Physical Phenomena&quot; including\n&gt; paranormal studies and remote perception.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * North Carolina - Duke University&#39;s Rhine Research Center is &quot;an\n&gt; Institute for the Study of Consciousness,&quot; and offers many psi-related\n&gt; courses, workshops, and seminars.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; JAPAN\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * The International Society of Life Information Science (ISLIS) offers\n&gt; academic symposia and parapsychology research opportunities.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; NETHERLANDS\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * Amsterdam - The Psychology department at the University of Amsterdam\n&gt; has offered courses in paranormal studies. In July 2006, parapsychology\n&gt; courses were not featured at their website, which is in Dutch. With further\n&gt; research, you may find their courses, or they may feature them later.

Bierman at the University of Utrecht (UU)\n&gt; offers an Internet-based introduction to parapsychology.
