I am no longer connected to Haunted Times in any way, except Chris \nMoon can keep and use the Ghost Boxes he has, I won&#39;t be supplying anymore.  \nI very much dislike the concept, and activity of &quot;ghost huning&quot;, there too \nmany egos, associated wiht it, to many that think they are the worlds only \nparanoramal experts, and way too much focus on the negative, and &quot;scary&quot; \naspects.  My systems are not designed for that ....stuff, and I can&#39;t \nsupport those activities, even it means that I don&#39;t personaly put any more \nof my boxes out there in the public. The information for making this stuff \nis out there, and others can build this stuff, and do whatever they want \nwith it. I doubt if there will be many &quot;Frank&#39;s Box&quot; clones out there, while \nthe circuits are straight forward, it takes the &quot;certain understanding&quot; to \nget it to work.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nExercise your brain!
