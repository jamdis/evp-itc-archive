Hi Frank,
 
You are absolutely right.  I have a woman who works for me who is  intrigued 
by all of this.  I started to do a few box sessions with her and  have great 
results.  She says she doesn't hear a lot of things but a lot of  things she 
does hear.  And now she says she is a believer.  And once  she made that 
statement we reached a different plain of all religious ramblings  and singing.  This 
is something new for me but when I am with her doing  this that is all we get 
mixed in with messages.  We have gotten some great  results and then they 
start singing to us and it is all good  communication.  Think I will keep her 
around for more sessions.
 
Jeff

Look,  if you look around it won't take long before you find this type of 
hate laden  speech. It stems from fear and misunderstanding. It is invited by 
those who  seek validation. You can explain to them your ideas till your blue in 
the face  and they still won't get it.

My point is, don't try to convince the  unconvincible. Seek people of like 
mind and spiritual nature and you can't go  wrong. I remember reading this blog 
among others and I have to say, I am not  impressed by their logic or 
argument. Follow your own  path.

Regards,

Frank R.

That was the very point with my previous post I was trying make!   But little 
old me knows nothing, hummmm!
 
I guess Frank is the only one who people choose not to listen to.   Maybe he 
is a wise old owl (no pund intended Frank on the old part,  lol).
