<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Opinion follows:
I think what most people forget when they view the reality TV shows 
such as Door to the Dead, Ghost Hunters, Paranormal State, etc., are 
that these ARE Reality TV shows and nothing more.  I watch them as 
entertainment, and nothing more.
Yes, there are some real investigations going on concerning the 
paranormal, EVP, ITC spirit communication, entity dicovery, etc., but 
99.9% of the time you will not be witnessing a real investigation 
going on in a reality TV show. (G.H. DttD, P.S., etc.)
These type venues are about making money in the form of advertising 
dollars.
Your REAL investigations are being done by &#x27;unknowns&#x27; and people, and 
groups with nothing more than a few tools and a cheap video camera; 
not TruTV, Discovery Channel, or History Channel.
You usually don&#x27;t see REAL investigations on TV.

Yes, Ghost Hunters is the self proclaimed number one paranormal venue 
on the tube, but do you really think they are following REAL 
investigative techniques?
If you&#x27;ve seen the show... you should have that answer.

G.H. is scheduled to come to a local Inn near me; an Inn that has 
very very few incidents of paranormal activity in its past history.
BUT, I bet when I see that episode on G.H., there will be more 
activity in the first hour of the show than has gone on in the entire 
history of the INN.  WHY???  Becasue it&#x27;s reality TV and to make 
money they have to induce activity and action... otherwise no one 
will watch.

So... bottom line.  Don&#x27;t view shows like G.H., Door to the Dead, 
Paranormal State, and the others as the definition of an 
investigative series... watch them for the entertainment value, and 
you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.....

Okay... stepping off the paranormal soapbox now.
Thanks for listening!

&gt; I am pleased that the outcome for the family was positive. And I am 
not surprised. The key I think is that a belief system was 
successfully altered. This in turn likely impacted the focal person, 
who based on the limited information presented could have been the 
young man. 
.........to achieve them most likely.

&gt; Thank you for your interest as this is an important topic of 
discussion.
