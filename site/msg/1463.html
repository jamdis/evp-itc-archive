&gt;
&gt;Bill said something that had me thinking. He mentioned that when he first 
&gt;got his box it called Franks name repeatedly. That isnt the first time I 
&gt;saw someone say that. I know quite a few of you now have been given a box 
&gt;or even constructed your own versions like Steve based on the work Frank 
&gt;did.
&gt;
&gt;   I have heard a couple of peoples results here but I would like to hear 
&gt;more so I am going to ask if you have one you comment on your use of it and 
&gt;how you think the results went as well as maybe post a few sound files that 
&gt;I can hear. I have spent years listening to the box voices but its 
&gt;refreshing to hear others results and see the variations as with any other 
&gt;evp method, it differs by user/location. LOL you know who you are and I 
&gt;wont name you all but I do hope you will share with us.
&gt;
&gt;   Thanks!
&gt;   Misty
