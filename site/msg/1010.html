<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just to add to what others said -

If you&#x27;re talking about speakers on your computer, it quite often is a
driver problem as well.  I have a Soundblaster X-FI (with the front
panel I/O) for example, and the drivers are notoriously finicky under
XP.  The last time it went out, it was just like you described - loud
pop through the speakers then no sound.  I build my own PC&#x27;s and work
in software, so troubleshooting is down my alley and I proceeded to
troubleshoot after that happened.  Reseated the card, uninstalled and
reinstalled the drivers, etc. etc.  Wouldn&#x27;t work right until several
weeks later after another reboot everything finally was mapped right.

&gt; Hey,
&gt; I am having an unbelievable time with fried equipment. Now my sound
is blown! No speakers or headphones work. I heard a pop and
then(silence is not always golden for us evp types!) I have been
through alot of hardware this month! Thats not mentioning screwed up
software, digital recorders and sound files and emails that just seem
to go missing! I hear from other researchers that this is not
uncommon.Im losing stuff quickly. Ill be outta business before long!
Is there a safeguard for this? Anyone had these things happen to them?
&gt; Ive wondered if emf protection might be in order...I hope I dont
sound completely madd!(besides, its the Madd Hatter thats got that
covered. Im actually more like Alice...clueless! So...SOS!
&gt; in other words...
&gt; HELP!
