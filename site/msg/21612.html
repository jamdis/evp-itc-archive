<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Fact is, I started with all the old stuff, white noise, and read Raudive, Jorgenson, and anything else I coulkd find on the web.I quickly found better methods, such as EVPmaker, and if you claim that doesn&#x27;t work you&#x27;ll just be announcing your ignorance. From EVPmaker I came up with the box idea, the theory behind the box, as well as EVPmaker is provide a &quot;raw audio&quot;, that is sound that contains bits of human speech, and &quot;they&quot; will talk. &quot;They&quot; being various entities and spirits. 

 Why would anyone want to go back to old shit!?
