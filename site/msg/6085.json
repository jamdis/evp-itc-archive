I am not sure whether that is a \nhealthy thing or not, the other posts pertain to seriousness of \nresearch in the sense that some individuals believe and practice \ntheir research on a solely scientific and antiseptic basis.\n\nMy definition of serious research is to do my best everyday to truly \ntry and make the communication, technology and relationship between \nour world and the spirit world better and to continue to advance it.\n\nI know that our spirit counter parts are working a 1000% harder to \nsend the communication than we are to receive it, my technitions have \nliteraly told me so. With that in mind I believe they deserve our \nrespect, gratitude and full effort and cooperation. To me that \nentails a high level of seriousness when approaching this research.\n\nIf we are not completely serious about this gift of communication \nwith other realms, then it is not research but a hobby, and in my \nopinion if your looking for a hobby take up needle point.\n\nAnyway that&#39;s the way I approach this research, just wanted to make \nmy opinion known.\n\nAS USUAL!\n\nBruce"}
