<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I just received this note today from the AAEVP:

&quot;AA-EVP founder, Sarah Estep, was taken to the Hospital on Christmas
 day.  The doctors have given her just a few days to live.  Her family
 hopes to bring her home to care for her until her transition. If you 
want to be kept up to date on this please email us back at ----------,
 otherwise we will post general information in a second broadcast.  Our
 prayers are with Sarah for an easy crossing. We know that there will be
 many who will be waiting to greet her.  Our prayers are also with her
 family to help them through this difficult time.



Tom and Lisa Butler&quot;
