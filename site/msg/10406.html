 Yeah, firggin' wierd, and sad. When Bruce was calm, and rational he had s=
ome real good commentaries, and box instruction. I don't know what the deal=
 is, and hope it is not box related, that still concerns me, as I wnder if =
maybe this stuff is not for everyone. What if there are dangers? I've done =
my share of angry e-mails cuz I thought the boxes were not being used 'prop=
erly', but realized everyone is different, the most important thing is the =
personal messages one might get. I've heard/seen others use the boxes at th=
e Stanley--the only haunted place I've ever been too, and was surprised at =
the Q & A, as it worked. Like, dah, forgot about that--sorry!
