<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I guess police still use those codes. Emergency agencies such as ESDA now
follow the FEMA Incident Command System/National Incident Management
System which requires all communications to be in plain English (no codes).

&gt;    Tonight at work I was talking to a state trooper, there had been an
&gt; accident. I asked him if there were any deaths (it was very very bad) and he
&gt; said he didnt know so he got on his radio and called in and asked them if it
&gt; was a 7 at the site. They told him negative, and he told me the little boy
&gt; who was the worst off was still alive. I asked him why did you ask them if
&gt; it was a 7. He said code 7, I was asking them if they were dead. So if you
&gt; ever hear anyone call 7 over the radio that means someones dead.
&gt;
&gt; Just thought I would pass that on. I find it interesting since I know alot
&gt; of us have heard this before when used to describe who is speaking rather
&gt; than a name they say seven.
