I have attached some clips where I ask what my roll is.  They advised me of several things.  Some of the key words are in the clips and the fact that they acknowledge we need proof is amazing to me.  The tec&#39;s as well call them are reflected in the last clip when I asked if I should do a session.  A female say no, and then proceeds to response &quot;you will see&quot;.  For whatever its worth, if I get some sort of direction as a response, I comply (by choice and in reason).  I can&#39;t help but wonder if sometimes they don&#39;t have a best interest at heart?  Whether they do or not, this is extremely exciting to me, and count my blessing everyday that I am was lead on this path and will continue to follow where ever it takes me.\n   \n  Juli\n   \n             \n\nFrank Ratka &lt;warrior18eii@...&gt; wrote: \n              I don&#39;t mind telling you.
