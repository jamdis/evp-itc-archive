    Carradine Death Was Accidental

    IMDb, June 4,=
 2009

    David Carradine died during a sex game that went wrong, accordin=

  =
  Carradine's body was discovered in a hotel suite and local reports sugges=
ted he committed suicide. 

    He was discovered by a maid, naked and hang=
ed, but the suggestions his death had a sexual twist were strongly disputed=
 by the star's close friend, attorney Vicki Roberts, and his manager Chuck =
Binder, who insisted he died of natural causes. 

    But a statement from =
Carradine's representative now indicates the actor died during a sex act.

=
    The spokesperson tells TMZ.com, "We can confirm 100 percent that he nev=
er would have committed suicide. It was an accidental death. Everybody is i=
n shock." 

    Rumours Carradine died attempting auto-erotic asphyxiation-=
-where victims achieve heightened sexual pleasure by restricting their air =
supply are backed up by a quote a Bangkok police officer gave to British ne=
wspaper The Sun. 

    The cop tells reporters, "A rope was attached to his=
 neck and also to his penis". 

    Rocker Michael Hutchence was rumoured t=
o have died attempting the same sex act in a Sydney, Australia, hotel room =
back in 1997--although his death was officially declared a suicide.
