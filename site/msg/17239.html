<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Welcome Fiona!

 Personally, I dopn&#x27;t believe in hainted hot spots, or portals. I think the
spirits and entities exist ina higher demension, and so have full access to
us and our speace, with virtually no linmitations.

 I don&#x27;t go to hanunted areas to record, or test boxes, I do it from home
and have no shortage of contacts.

 Paranormal activity is whereever one expects it to be.

 There does seem to be conditions that limit contacts via EVP, similar to
radio propogation, which might make it seem like activeity is spiking. From
me, my ET contacts have about three month interval.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m new to this group, but not new to paranormal studies. Depending on how
&gt; willing I am to reveal my age, I admit to between 20 and 30 years&#x27; active
&gt; research in ghost-related fields.
&gt;
&gt; Today, most people seem to associate me with my research to analyze &amp;
&gt; predict locations where paranormal activity will spike. (It&#x27;s not just ley
&gt; lines.)
&gt;
&gt; My goal is to refine those predictions so people can be in the right places
&gt; at the right times, to use devices that will prove (and/or analyze) that
&gt; something paranormal is going on.
&gt;
&gt; Right now, one of our big problems is not knowing where to investigate for
&gt; the best and most consistent results, and when to have the equipment set up.
&gt; (It&#x27;s like surfing: I keep hearing people say, &quot;You should have been here
&gt; yesterday...&quot;)
&gt;
&gt; Though I&#x27;ve generally dismissed most EVP in the past, seeing Chris Moon&#x27;s
&gt; work at a recent event... that got my attention in a hurry.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m very interested in anything that provides a voice to whatever-it-is
&gt; people (including me, for convenience sake) tend to call &quot;ghosts.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ve seen several not-impressive demonstrations of the Shack Hack, and then
&gt; one that was vastly better, but it didn&#x27;t make me run out and buy (or make)
&gt; one. I may need to revisit that.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ve used an Ovilus, which seemed to work okay for me, but I haven&#x27;t seen
&gt; the same compelling results in others&#x27; hands... even with the same Ovilus.
&gt; (Then again, I don&#x27;t ask questions. I&#x27;ll talk to whatever-it-is,
&gt; conversationally, but that&#x27;s my limit. To me -- at least at this point -- it
&gt; feels rather rude to demand a performance on cue.)
&gt;
&gt; The box that Chris Moon had... it impressed me, big time. I&#x27;d like to
&gt; understand who (or what) are talking, where they&#x27;re actually talking from,
&gt; and why they think it&#x27;s important to tell us whatever they&#x27;re saying.
&gt;
&gt; My background is art and writing, not electronics. So, I&#x27;m not quite sure
&gt; where to go from here. I can manage simple electronics tweaks, but diagrams
&gt; are beyond me, at least for now.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, that&#x27;s who I am and where I am with this concept. I&#x27;m delighted to
&gt; find this group, and I can see lots of hours ahead, reading the Archives,
&gt; etc.
&gt;
&gt; Cheerfully,
&gt; Fiona Broome
