<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ann,

I tried to relocate the post in which you asked me about my negative
experiences. After 10 minutes searching... new topic.

As it relates to the box, I really only have two personal experiences
that might be considered negative. 

The first one is contained in a posting I just made prior to this. I
will refer you back to it, if you don&#x27;t mind. The experience is
contained in the copy and paste from my April 17, 2007 blog. It did
not effect me personally  but I did witness the effects of negative
energy on what/who came through the box. 

The second negative experience is one I have not spoken of to anyone
besides who was there that day and one close trusted friend. This
occurred in September of this year:
Chris, myself and four others who will remain nameless, were gathered
in a hotel room. For the sake of the story, I will refer to the main
subject as Mary. 
Mary had been experiencing severe negative phenomenon for years. This
included poltergeist type activity, personal harm and had since moved
into effecting her young son. I can not get into the exact details of
this negativity but suffice it to say that all accounts led everyone
to believe that Mary was dealing with a demon or demons. 
This was the second time Mary had sought out Chris for assistance. 
The first time she had noticed a change for a short time but then
&quot;things&quot; had returned as before and in some instances had worsened.
This particular day Mary found herself surrounded by trusted friends
and was ready to try again. There was a psychic medium, a healer and,
myself, a sensitive along with another person with no stated
abilities. Our goal was to turn on the box and receive some direction
about what to do and how to help. I won&#x27;t reveal the details of what
was said as they are not relevant to the post topic. 
As some time went on and we moved into a second session with the box,
Chris became noticeably weaker. It was obvious that his energy was
being used. I noticed that I was becoming quite weepy. You&#x27;ll have to
take my word on this when I say I am not a weepy person. Sensitive or
not, I do not become emotional. Yet as time passed, I found I couldn&#x27;t
control the tears falling. I rationalized it by recognizing I was
probably becoming emotional with compassion as Mary discussed very
private issues. 
The psychic medium present told us at this point that we should place
our hands on Mary. Not considering that I was in no state to offer
energy/help to anyone, I placed my hand on Mary&#x27;s leg. Suddenly, I
began to feel what I can only describe as &quot;thick&quot; energy move into my
hand, up my arm, through my chest and then settle into my stomach. As
it sat in my stomach I could literally feel it turn into sludge. It
began to churn and move up into my throat. At this point, I knew I was
going to vomit and I knew it would be black. I knew this was evil.
Fortunately, some focus switched to me at this point because I felt
paralyzed. I was removed from the room and brought outside where, with
assistance, I was able to let go of what was not mine. It took
approximately 30 minutes before I felt myself again.
Back to Mary for a moment; After the sessions that night, she had a
noticeable physical change, in particular to her face. It shocked me.
Where she had appeared hard or almost calloused in her expressions,
she was now much softer in appearance. Her life improved dramatically.
She has had one more session with Chris and the box and things
continue to improve.
The TTTD or Frank&#x27;s Box or whatever you want to refer to it as, is a
powerful device. It has the ability to connect to other dimensions. It
can be a wonderful thing. It can also be quite scary in the wrong
hands. I believe that just as good can be called upon to help, so can
dark and we know that there are many people out there who are far more
concerned in working with lower levels than the higher.</pre>
