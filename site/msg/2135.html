Wow, that's a very good question. I didn't even think of that. Very good Ly=
nn! I guess the way to solve that would be to use another recorder to recor=
d the responses. If the recorders are spaced sufficiently the receiving rec=
order should not register something as soft as an EVP from the sending devi=
ce. I guess to some though it would leave enough doubt as to skew any resul=
ts they may get.

Hello all,
      I know I =
do not post much here, so let me start.  Going along these lines of thought=
, if you are recording the questions onto an audio tape and leaving 20 seco=
nds of silence between them, you are still recording you and possibly your =
thoughts as well as any spirits that might be around you or your recording =
environment at that time.  So how do you know that what you listen back on =
is from the location you placed the recorder in and not from the location y=
ou recorded the questions in or from your own creation?  Just something to =
think about.

Back when I still investigated haunted sites, our te=

ave our audio equipment recording in several "hot spots" all over the house=
 and then leave for an hour or two. I have to say, in our experience we nev=

 EVP when we reentered the house saying, "here they come, lets go". I don't=
 necessarily understand why a ghost or spirit would talk with no one presen=
t to receive the message unless during setup you explained what you are try=

tried explaining). A piece of machinery (recorders) in an empty room does n=
ot have a consciousness or spiritual presence I would be interested to see =
if you get different results.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] EVP Experiment =
planned in October.

    To try and rule out that the EVP researchers are i=
mprinting voices 
psychokinetically on audio players mistaken as ghosts voi=
ces, I will 
pre-tape an interactive evp session.

I will record a bank of =
thirty questions, 20 seconds of silence 
after each question, on a cassete =
tape and played on a cassette 
player that will be utilized in all three bu=
ildings in a known 
haunted location just outside of Phoenix, Arizona.

The=
re will be digital recorders, cassette recorders, omni 
directional microph=
ones, condensor microphones, as well as an 
electrocet boom microphone pres=
ent in
 all of the sessions. There 
will be no human agents in the building=
s when these sessions take 
place.

My hope is to:

Record an authentic EVP=
 with no human agent in the building. 

If this is phenomena driven, will t=
he phenomena communicate by 
responding to questions from a machine rather =
than a human agent? 

If you have any ideas to enhance this experiment, ple=
ase feel free 
to let me know. This experiment will take place on October 2=
7th. 

James
