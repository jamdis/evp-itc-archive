I did not insist he bring the boxes back after our last falling out. Although I did suggest he should return them, as I just did again. However, he still insists he&#39;s testing them. So why does charge $500 and hour for a test? I don&#39;t care what he does with the boxes, until he tells me my use of the box is wrong! When he says I only get demons, or implies that, then I get pissed. I believe I am in the &quot;other users&quot; group. No onje has a right to take what I made, and claim to be the only authority on it. \n&gt;  \n&gt;   I suggest we drop it, current use of related technology, and the results will show what is true and what is not. Sooner or later Pen and Teller may show up at a GHU, and that will be that.

HMMM? IS this a lie, too??? Just wondering what&#39;s up? =Judy= Oh! He also says there that this is for Entertainment, too!!!! What???!!! %-/ \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Your smile counts.

Hi Frank & All,  Thanks for clarifying this, as since Chris says on his site that he&#39;s been allowed to KEEP the box(es), I guess, for &quot;testing&quot;! I agree with how you feel about your machine, &quot;Frank&#39;s Box&quot; and YOU are the True Authority on it, NOT some Entertainer/Paranormal Investigator (making people pay a high price to participate!). Well, when we all can do our own Paranormal Investigating or testing & SHARE it with others, he will loose out (It&#39;s Karma). I don&#39;t buy the Chris-tianized ideas/beliefs he&#39;s appearently promoting about the &quot;dangerous&quot; entities/demons or Portals opening up - this is NOT a Ouija Board!!!!! One really doesn&#39;t need an &quot;interpriter&quot; to hear the EVP&#39;s/voices! He&#39;s acting like a bad Medium, I feel. Plus, putting all of us &quot;others&quot; down in our researching/testing . . . like inexperienced researchers = ugh!!! If it wasn&#39;t for YOU, we all, including HIM, wouldn&#39;t be here! I&#39;m sorry, to find out How he&#39;s conducting himself, now.  =Judy="}
