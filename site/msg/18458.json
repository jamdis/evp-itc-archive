I have had things happen and it always seems to be after I have spent some time trying to communicate with one of those methods. Does this kind of communication bring spirits into your home? Has anyone else had similar experiences to Rick?\nThanks,\nCountry\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rick Wegrzyn &lt;rickwegrzyn@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been investigating for 33 years...The day I got that &quot;BOX&quot; really changed \n&gt; things...I don&#39;t take everything I hear as spirit,if I catch it on EVP and it&#39;s \n&gt; clear I&#39;ll take it under my wing for some sort of response,BUT on the other hand \n&gt; We&#39;re getting our names called and asnwers to &quot;Do You Know Where You Are ?&quot; An d \n&gt; the response made us stop and wonder...reponse was &quot;In the basement&quot;......HELLO \n&gt; we&#39;re in the Basement......Also I believe it will bring out the EVIL \n&gt; SIDE...which we did..and both my house as well as our partners seems to have \n&gt; someone that has followed us,turning on lights in the kitchen and opening the \n&gt; kitchen cabinets up,It made me feel sick all day and affected our cat...not to \n&gt; mention simular things at our partners home...Be careful what you say and ask \n&gt; for...cause you might get more than you want.....Love Ya Frank....Rick\n&gt;"}
