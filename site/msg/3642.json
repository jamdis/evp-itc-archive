Before a female voice there is a clear male voice that \nsounds like it says &quot;GET OUT&quot;\n\nFollowed by that is what sounds like a female voice, much softer, \nsaying &quot;sprits [something] us&quot;  The something sounds rather \ndisturbing...which is why I don&#39;t want to say it without a cleaner \nversion of the audio.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have shown you what I did with my three modified 12-469 radios, \nin my \n&gt; videos I have shared on the web.  As of yesterday morning I had not \n&gt; tried my modified (older version) 12-470 yet. Well, I took it to \nour \n&gt; local city cemetery yesterday afternoon to see what I could get. I \n&gt; visited gravesites of people I knew had died tragically and \nquickly.  \n&gt; They say those spirits never had a chance to express prior to being \n&gt; taken, it was just too fast.\n&gt; Anyway, I just downloaded the third file and listened.  Oh my.... \nit \n&gt; gave me chills when I heard her voice at the last second of the \n&gt; recording.  Am I hearing what I think I am hearing?  Can someone \n&gt; confirm what is being said? (It is the last voice, I think saying \nthree \n&gt; words just before I turned the 12-470 off.\n&gt; I&#39;ve placed the file in the folder UFO Geek Files in the file \nsection. \n&gt; It&#39;s named leah_ann_3.wav\n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; - Mike\n&gt;"}
