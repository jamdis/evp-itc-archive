I am a ghosthunter and I have had great success in recording \nEVP&#39;s recently. I have included a link to one of our recent \ninvestigations and recorded an EVP at a restaurant that said &quot;Say \nGoodbye!&quot; as an investigator and myself were walking away from the \narea.This is an authentic EVP.\n\nIt came from a cassette tape and has not been altered or filtered in \nthe least. I have been an active ghosthunter for about 3 years now. \nHere is the link. Would like to know what you all think of it.\n\n\nhttp://www.arizonaparanormalinvestigations.com/MSG.htm\n\n\nQuestion: I am noticing a strange echo reverberation when I record \nloud EVP&#39;s. When I record &quot;whisper&quot; type EVP&#39;s I don&#39;t get this echo.\n\nWhat do you all think casuses this strange echo quality?\n\nLook forward to talking to all of you!\n\nJames"}
