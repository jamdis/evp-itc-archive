In fact it just before you \n&gt;posted about wolf possibly having something to do with a quake. One of the \n&gt;researchers present with us named Maxx is a Native American is referred by \n&gt;others in his tribe as Grey Wolf. You had not yet posted about wolf meaning \n&gt;quake so we thought perhaps the messages we were hearing were for Maxx.
