 OVILUS








I do not have an ovilus or a puck - I was going to get one,=
 but I participated in many sessions alternating puck, ovilus, and radio de=
vices.

 

Although at times we would get relevant responses on the puck an=
d ovilus, more often than not it would be confusing, irrelevant, and disjoi=
nted.


We would invariably return to the the radios and have much better r=
esults, so at this time I have decided to concentrate my efforts on radios =
and a couple of other methods and areas I am still researching.

 

I alway=
s encourage people to do t heir own research, though. If you want to, go fo=
r it!

Just let us know what happens.
The results I talked about were not m=
eant to discourage you, just to tell you what we experienced. Maybe some pe=
ople do better with the puck and ovilus. Not everyone is meant to do everyt=
hing.

I personally have not used thi=

e has used it only a few times but the results were encourageing. On her fi=
rst recorded session, when asking "why are you here", the reply that she re=
cieved certainly seemed relevant. The Ovilus stated " fell running down sta=
irs, broken neck". Ano ther interesting response from the recording was in =
reply to the question "who are you?" The response from the Ovilus was "ghos=
t". However, she also recieved responses that did not seem relevant to the =
questions she was asking at the time. She sends me all of her recordings fo=
r review so I will keep you posted on the results. Personally, I can't wait=
 to get my hands on one to try it out for myself.
