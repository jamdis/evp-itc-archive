&gt; Hi all;  I got a call, actually my wife got the call since I was at 
work, from a guy claiming he got my phone number from a &#x27;hack&#x27; box. It 
could have been fake, but--- I had on my dresser a portable tape deck 
with a session dated 08/03/08, and at the spot I stopped was this 
voice talking about &#x27;John (or jon)&#x27; calling. An example maybe of what 
I call &quot;talk as if live&quot;, or voices on old tapes talking about the 
present moment. Weeeeeird!
&gt;  
&gt;  This stuff never ceases to amaze me.
