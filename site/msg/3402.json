I have my thoughts and\n&gt; &gt; opinions on topics but feel strongly about &quot;to each his own&quot;. Unless\n&gt; &gt; something strikes me as completely wrong, I won&#39;t debate. No one here\n&gt; &gt; has heard from me other than recently with this mini-box yet, I am\n&gt; &gt; here several times weekly reading and offering my energy in support of\n&gt; &gt; the research.\n&gt; &gt; However...something is striking me here and again, I can&#39;t keep my\n&gt; &gt; mouth shut. The discussion about the family hour with the box has led\n&gt; &gt; the way for people to mention negativity and even &quot;the dark guys&quot; can\n&gt; &gt; be fun if not taken seriously.\n&gt; &gt; I ask you to consider the fact that many who purchase the mini-box\n&gt; &gt; will not be of the right frame of mind. Most will not be in harmony.\n&gt; &gt; Many will take &quot;the dark guys&quot; seriously. Yet, you feel it&#39;s a good\n&gt; &gt; idea to let anyone who wants a box have one? All in the name of\n&gt; &gt; sharing technology.\n&gt; &gt; I know that my previous posts expressing my concern over the mass\n&gt; &gt; marketing of the box, was barely given consideration. Realize that I\n&gt; &gt; am not being selfish- I do not own a box. EVP is my passion and has\n&gt; &gt; been from day one 6 years ago when I jumped fully into the field. I am\n&gt; &gt; successful in capturing EVP, always have been. I still do it the &quot;old\n&gt; &gt; fashioned way&quot; with open air techniques. Would I love to be able to\n&gt; &gt; hold real time 2 way communications with the other side? Of course.\n&gt; &gt; However, I do not think enough research into the possibilities has\n&gt; &gt; been done to warrant the approval let alone production of these boxes.\n&gt; &gt; Those of us who have been on countless investigations with many people\n&gt; &gt; will quickly admit that there are some people we&#39;d rather not\n&gt; &gt; investigate with. When they are present, negative things tend to\n&gt; &gt; happen. We all know one or two people who we can say &quot;felt dark&quot; from\n&gt; &gt; the first meeting. We all admit that being mentally sound is an\n&gt; &gt; important quality in this field. If you have mental issues, this may\n&gt; &gt; not be the area of research for you. We don&#39;t bring children on\n&gt; &gt; investigations for obvious reasons. BUT! If you want a box that could\n&gt; &gt; possibly open up a portal and bridge the gap between here and the\n&gt; &gt; dark, sure! Anyone who wants one should have it!\n&gt; &gt; You might feel that I am over reacting or being overly dramatic.\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s fine. My concern is not what you think of me but that you\n&gt; &gt; consider the possibilities here. Many of which we do not know. Can you\n&gt; &gt; be 100% sure that this is a good idea or that it&#39;s worthy of saying\n&gt; &gt; &quot;well, we&#39;ll see what happens&quot;?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday\n&gt; &gt; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bill,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You have the right idea, I recently have dealt with a lot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of negativity from my Frank&#39;s box.
