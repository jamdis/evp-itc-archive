<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank..
Take a big breath and relax a bit...at this pace you will have a stroke.

I am one of the lonely members that sit back and read what others are 
getting.
I don&#x27;t have a box of any kind.
but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from reading what others are getting.
I was lent a RS box at one time and i have to say it did freak me out 
for a second then i played with it for a day and had to give it back.
during that time i did have some good responses.

The first thing i did was turned the box on and and said out load my 
name is earl can some one repeat my name please.
and within a second or two it did..i heard my name Earl coming back to me..
Now the name Earl is not that common of a name now days.so what is the 
odds of hearing someone coming back to me just after asking someone to 
do so??
it did freak me out for a few minutes .told the wife what happened then 
turned it on and did some more.
My son came over and we did some testing. it was fun and very 
interesting what we were getting back.
but in the most part it did seem to replay to most of what we were asking .
the wife and i live off SSD so money is tight..but some day i will get a 
box of some kind and be able to do some more research.
Until then i will just read what others are getting..
sorry for being so long winded.just wanted to say take it easy on you&#x27;re 
self ..life is short..
Earl</pre>
