<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Aaron,

&gt; Stefan/Ron L.: That definately does sound like a good idea. I will
&gt; see if I can try that. Maybe when I get home, I will see if I can 
&gt; copy and paste the text that is supposed to be read to the group. If 
&gt; I can, anybody that can help in synthesizing the allophones to read 
&gt; the text, that would be a great help. To do that you have to have 
&gt; Adobe Audition correct? Or is there anything else you can use/build?

Adobe Audition or Cool Edit. However, I have read that the newer
versions of Audition don&#x27;t have a Play List anymore. But instead of
using the Play List, the individual allophones can also be combined by
using &quot;copy and paste&quot;.
