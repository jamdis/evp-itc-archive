&gt; Well, I&#x27;m sure you guys know already that there is a comet, ElLninne sp, 
&gt; and also an astrode, and not to mention some planet x that some think is 
&gt; hiding behind the sun?  These are going around our planet orbit now, the comet is 
&gt; moving very close to earth on the 21st of this month, May, and again in 
&gt; Sept. And nov. every time it does this we had earth quakes, that were those big 
&gt; ones.  Only two days ago, hundreds of dead animals were found in 
&gt; Yellowstone Park, and look at the thousand of animals and fish all over the world 
&gt; dead, this is a wild year.  Something is defiantly going on, and it&#x27;s nothing 
&gt; that is good. sf
