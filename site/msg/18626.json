As I switch to TRF a\n&gt; &gt; voice says &quot;People do listen&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Try to answer these skeptics and all they can do is accuse me of attacking\n&gt; &gt; them, while they accept no evidence, no one else&#39;s results, and break out\n&gt; &gt; all smug and arrogant.  Nothing paranormal eh!? Well explain just how\n&gt; &gt; something would know when I was going to switch and make a meaningful\n&gt; &gt; comment at that instant.  Actually don&#39;t bother explaining, I don&#39;t wanna\n&gt; &gt; hear your crap science answer.  Most thinking people here can see/hear there\n&gt; &gt; is something to the paranormal and it is not imagination.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  This is what I call the &quot;History Box&quot; as I tried to incorporate all\n&gt; &gt; functions I&#39;ve been using into one unit. It almost works, been working on it\n&gt; &gt; since last December. Arm Band tuner, TRF tuner, and car tuner, random and\n&gt; &gt; linear sweep, random still needs work.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  F-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
