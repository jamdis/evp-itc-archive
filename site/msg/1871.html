<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>When I do an fm sweep recording I pause for a second at each end of the 
dial it kind of breaks the recording don into managable sections of 
about 5 seconds each. As I was going over the last recording I happened 
to notice a distinct whisper during one of the pauses. I have a fish 
tank in the room that makes a running water sound but it is very faint 
and on the other side of the room from were I do the recordings. I 
amplified this small segment and low and behold an evp I believe it 
says &quot; why can&#x27;t you hear me &quot; please give a listen and let me know 
what you hear.
