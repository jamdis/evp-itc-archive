okay, now I know. no names needed.
Hmmm. I bet no one else thought about th=
e steel ship problem.....
I was thinking about going just cause it is cheap=
, and you were going to
be there.
I am sure that I am not alone in hoping t=
hat you do go......
I was looking forward to meeting you, and asking you a =
BILLION
questions..... LOL
However, you are right about the debunkers......=

I think Moon took his ( gift) box (that's what I call it) because it was
g=
iven to him as a gift. LOL
And his box worked ( but, that was on TV)
 
PLZ =
go Frank....You don't go to many of these, and there are some FS
followers =
who just
want to pick your brain....

 He's listed on the Darkness =
