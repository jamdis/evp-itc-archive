<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>&quot;The proof&quot; is in what comes through, what is the meaning to the individual.
I don&#x27;t think you can prove a spirit is talking. The skeptics out there that
try to debunk this stuff put alot of doubt in people&#x27;s minds. All you can, I
think is use the stuff and report your results.  Often information is
received that tends to prove something talks that shouldn&#x27;t be
there--ignored by the skeptics.

&gt; So last Saturday I had my first ghost box session with an experienced box
&gt; user who also claims to be an empath medium. It was successful, in that
&gt; there were too many intelligent responses from the radio for it to be &quot;a
&gt; coincidence&quot;. Despite this, there are some people I&#x27;ve talked to about this
&gt; who, even after having heard the recording of the session, still want to
&gt; hold on to an old way of thinking at any cost to logic and reality. Just
&gt; because it is too amazing to be true, doesn&#x27;t ALWAYS mean that it is. For
&gt; those of us that have experienced the paranormal in our life, we know that
&gt; not all things in life are too incredible to be true. But for others, it is
&gt; harder to accept...
&gt; Tonight I hacked my first ghost box, a Radio Shack 20-125, it was an easy
&gt; hack despite claims that it is difficult, and the fact that I am completely
&gt; new to this area of research and know next to nothing about electronics. I
&gt; could really see myself spending a lot of my future life immersed in this,
&gt; so can anyone tell me... what do I say to somebody that wants to claim that
&gt; ghost box communication is a technological government conspiracy akin to the
&gt; conspiracy of using Christianity to brainwashes the masses... (i.e. to keep
&gt; them believing in the next life, so they can be &quot;raped&quot; and willingly give
&gt; to Caesar in this life). What is the proof and evidence against this being
&gt; the case?
