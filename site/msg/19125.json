I used to work at a recording\n&gt; studio that had 4 reverb plates from the 1950&#39;s.  They were so big that they\n&gt; had to be hung in a semi trailer.  All audio outboard reverb&#39;s available\n&gt; today function on the same principle as your echo chamber, but the use solid\n&gt; state circuitry and chips to accomplish the task.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it possible to include an echo chamber section that is separate from the\n&gt; internal component section of your box?  A box connected to your box but is\n&gt; separated by thick wood?  This may cut down on your problem of portability,\n&gt; but may not entirely get rid of the problem because waves are so large that\n&gt; they conduct through wood (put your ear to the back of an electric guitar or\n&gt; bass and strum it, you will still hear a little).  If you attached your\n&gt; chamber to the box, had it separated by solid wood, and gave it ventilation\n&gt; slits, you might not have this problem anymore.\n&gt;\n&gt; The demonic sound is not surprising.  Most commercial reverbs allow for\n&gt; pre-delay (the sound and then the reverb) in milliseconds, and decay (how\n&gt; long the sound lasts after).  Your echo chambers don&#39;t have this so if you\n&gt; build it on a big board, it is like the reverb is equivalent to yelling in a\n&gt; concert hall versus if your echo chamber was built on a smaller board it\n&gt; would sound like yelling in a bathroom.  The safe effect, only the result is\n&gt; curtailed.\n&gt;\n&gt; The original reverb plates which are kind of like your current echo chamber\n&gt; were built in a wooden box that had limited width but were significant in\n&gt; length and height.  Inside of the box were two metal plates.  The sound was\n&gt; fed into the box and the amount of reverb was controlled by turning a wheel\n&gt; that moved the plates closer to each other or farther apart, and this\n&gt; controlled the amount of the reverb.\n&gt;\n&gt; Your boxes will always sound better with reverb, it is like singing in the\n&gt; shower.  Because of the reverberation the voice sounds fuller.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, Oct 27, 2010 at 12:14 PM, Frank Sumption &lt;\n&gt; purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  [Attachment(s)&lt;https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&view=js&name=main,tlist&ver=vDkaykVSG9w.en.&am=!yGvcqUNUUxexhZ5ijtQ2ZMKIZroesisZtoKH5kognAihF0mgsh4P&fri#12bee8b0d0dc6caa_12bee77d4833b4b9_TopText&gt;from Frank Sumption included below]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  Feedback is the big problem with the internal echo chamber. For a while I\n&gt;&gt; was leaving out the echo chamber, but trying to provide external chambers\n&gt;&gt; was a problem too, it makes the box less portable. The chamber adds\n&gt;&gt; &quot;something&quot;, kinda like a filter, plus &quot;they&quot; seems to be able to make their\n&gt;&gt; voices easier. Usually I can drill holes in the cabinet to relive the\n&gt;&gt; feedback, with this box I had to seal the whole thing with silicone. I had a\n&gt;&gt; better seal between the battery compartment and the main compartment, so I\n&gt;&gt; guess sound was finding other ways to interact.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  The chamber speaker is less than an inch in diameter, and the mic just a\n&gt;&gt; standard electret.  I use three tubes, instead of the two shown in the\n&gt;&gt; diagram so I can get more separation. The larger the chamber the more\n&gt;&gt; pronounced the enhancement effect, the voices are almost scary. I made one\n&gt;&gt; once that was 12 inch by 48 inch MDF board lined with aluminum foil with\n&gt;&gt; crystals and magnets glued on the insides, OMG  I had to take to it apart!\n&gt;&gt; That was frikkin&#39; demonic.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  That&#39;s one reason I don&#39;t have a fixed design, there&#39;s just too much to\n&gt;&gt; this.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  F-S\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Wed, Oct 27, 2010 at 6:12 AM, Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a simple concept as to why the vents cut down on feedback.  As a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; former live sound engineer, feedback was quite the nemesis.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If I remember reading right, you have a small microphone and a small\n&gt;&gt;&gt; speaker in your &quot;echo chamber.&quot;  A feedback loop happens when a speaker\n&gt;&gt;&gt; produces audio and a microphone pics that audio up.  The thing is, if the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; speaker and microphone are not far enough apart from one another, a feedback\n&gt;&gt;&gt; loop occurs where the audio loop between microphone to speaker keeps\n&gt;&gt;&gt; building up and frequencies start to converge into feedback.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Considering that your echo chamber is right under the batteries, the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; microphone in the echo chamber is probably picking up the audio from the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; main speaker output at the same time as the output that is in the echo\n&gt;&gt;&gt; chamber.  The two sources picked up at the same time is causing the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; feedback.   By venting the battery chamber, the soundwaves from the main\n&gt;&gt;&gt; speaker  are being released easier from the hollow design of the box.  This\n&gt;&gt;&gt; allows for the natural reverberation caused by speaker output to stop\n&gt;&gt;&gt; reverberating around inside the box, it is this bouncing around of audio\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that is= eventually picked up by your echo chamber microphone at the same\n&gt;&gt;&gt; time and becomes feedback.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The same thing happens during a concert when a performer gets his\n&gt;&gt;&gt; microphone to close to the floor monitor.  A feedback loop occurs because\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the singer hear&#39;s his voice in the floor monitor at the same time as it is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; coming out of his mouth.  A loop occurs where the frequencies build upon\n&gt;&gt;&gt; each other and feedback happens.  In your case, the microphone inside the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; echo chamber is simply picking up the main speaker at the same time as the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; speaker in your echo box, causing the same audio pattern.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hope this helps,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Tim\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Wed, Oct 27, 2010 at 2:38 AM, Frank Sumption &lt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  [Attachment(s)&lt;https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&view=js&name=main,tlist&ver=vDkaykVSG9w.en.&am=!yGvcqUNUUxexhZ5ijtQ2ZMKIZroesisZtoKH5kognAihF0mgsh4P&fri#12bed9ab56331f24_12bec6a7bae7ff88_TopText&gt;from Frank Sumption included below]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The battery box is on top of the echo chamber, and venting the door\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; helps cut the feedback for some weird acoustical reason.
