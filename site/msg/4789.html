Good files Frank.  I noticed that the flow is good on these, especially the one with Bruce being in doubt.  The communication is constantly flowing through, instead of waiting as if it was scaning  a station.

There seems to be more static on the AM band tonight, part of that is cuz I think this board has more RF gain at the antenna then the previous board. It probably depends on the type of core I used for the coil, and since they are from the junk box, I have no idea what the permeability rating is for these cores. The core being a ferrite bobbin that I wind the coil on.
