 awesome.. that sounds good.. i do have k2's.. the last time i was there my emf ( which is the black one with the red end that lights up) well i left it on and in one area of the room.. it did go off a few times randomly.. but we didnt have our cameras up and recording at that time.. thanks for that idea.. we will use it..

to record your findings, keep in mind that the land and building was used in the 1700's
so they might not know what you are using, or what it does, Just tell them what you are 
doing , using , and what it does.  this has helped me in the past. I went to an old building it took 5 times before i got anything. so hoped this helped. good luck

      hello all... i am looking for a few ideas to try.. a few ppl from my 
group will be staying at the labahia in goliad pretty soon.. i have 
stayed 5 or 6 times already and never have got good proof of any 
thing.. i have seen alot and heard things there.. even got cold gust of 
wind rush thru the room.. but never get great evp's or great videos.. i 
do get nice orbs on a digital camera.. so if any 1 has any ideas for me 
and the group to try i would appreciate it greatly..

Thanks, Steven
