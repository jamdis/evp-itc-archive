There&#39;s really not a lot to it. Get\na radio with electronic tuning capability and build a sweep circuit.\nFrank just posted a circuit for a sweep the other day. You could even\ndo manual tuning with an analog radio by tuning the knob up and down.\n\nWhy do you need to record above 20 kHz? You can&#39;t hear it. No one that\nI know of has captured any EVP or ITC even close to that range. Most\nof my EVP have been in the lower normal human voice range.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn 3/8/11, Farrukh &lt;farrukhnaik2000@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi!\n&gt; Can anyone help me out in making a Frank&#39;s Ghost Box...with easy steps of\n&gt; assembling the components...i would really appreciate ur efforts..\n&gt; Secondly i have a question for u guys....i am using sony IC recorder model\n&gt; ICDPX820 533 hours recording for EVP but the limitation of this IC recorder\n&gt; is that it records in MP3 format which is not required as wav format is more\n&gt; reliable and is closest to what u actually hear. and the next is its\n&gt; frequency range is 75 hz to 20 k and above 20 k it does not record any\n&gt; thing...\n&gt; so what is the best model available for EVP recording and is there anything\n&gt; which can be modified in the sony IC recorder so that it can record freq of\n&gt; more than 20 k...\n&gt; Hey i know it is time taking to answer these questions..but i ill be obliged\n&gt; if somebody out of u help me out....\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Farrukh\n&gt; www.thenightwalkers.org\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
