I have some very good &quot;CLEAR&quot; EVP&#39;s to share. I will convert them to Mp3.....but what is the LARGEST size it will accept before it will be deleted? It doesnt really say. I&#39;m only sharing....not trying to hog space. I have plenty on my PC :) Only problem now with me uploading again.....I won&#39;t include much info about the EVP (I am a slow typist....and won&#39;t go through the trouble at the moment) But I will edit and add info later. I was up late last night to upload. It may take awhile. You guys will really like them. Please use headphones as I have NOT enhanced them (only the ones where no voices where initially heard, and enhancement needed to find information) when I heard a pop,fuzz,bang,or clap sound....so I dug in with Audacity and FOUND the voice. With slow speed,change pitch,add bass, and amplification.....I was able to clean up audio without the squirrely sound that some EVP (enhanced) sound like."}
