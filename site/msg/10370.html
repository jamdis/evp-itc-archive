I subscribe to About.com and received this article.  I just thought I
woul=
d share.  I am not into the photo end of the paranormal, but it is
very int=
eresting if in fact this has not been manufactured in anyway.
  [Caf=E9 Pha=
ntom]  from Jodie McNamara Caf=E9 Phantom These are four
pictures I took in=
 quick succession at a caf=E9 near my house. I'm a
photographer and was tak=
ing pictures for artistic purposes when I
captured these. I remember taking=
 these photos, but do not remember
anyone or anything walking or otherwise =
passing past the lens. I was
left with the impression, in fact, that they w=
ould be unimpressive and
that they'd be deleted (though I waited, as usual,=
 until later to assess
my work).
They were taken without a flash with a Can=
on Rebel XTi (fps 5), a
shutter speed of =BC of a second, and without a tri=
pod (though I was
sitting still in a chair). After consulting a couple of o=
ther
photographers about the photo, I have yet to come up with an
explanati=
on. It was noted that the motion blur on the figure suggests
movement to th=
e right though the figure went left. There also appear to
be features sugge=
sting a face in the third frame, though there are
clearly no such markings =
in the first or second. It's also noteworthy
that everything else in the ph=
oto (including the two girls behind the
figure, one of whom was talking and=
 =96 between the second and third
pictures =96 had moved her hand) is in pe=
rfect focus.

Taking all this into consideration, we concluded that the fig=
ure,
whatever it is, seems to be twisting =96 fast and continuously - in a
=
counter-clockwise direction and that it covered about 8 or 9 feet of
space =
doing this in 1.8 seconds (given the shutter speed and fps speed
of the cam=
era). This without I, nor the two girls at the table, nor my
friend (whose =
elbow is in the bottom left hand corner) noticing.

I have all four of the =
originals. They were taken in RAW format on a
digital SLR and thus have sav=
ed the most information possible to have a
record of for each of these four=
 photographs (including the color
information).

Please let me know what yo=
u think. It looks like a ghost, smells like a
ghost=85does it sound like a =
ghost to you?
