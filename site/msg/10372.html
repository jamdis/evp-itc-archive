Hi Misty
   
  I converted all mine over to mp3 last night. I didnt have a lot of files to do but it sure made a huge different on the amount of spaced used.

  Hiya LC

Yeah sorry about that I was pretty tired after dealin with work and 
junk. That's definitely an idea to consider. Frank S. mentioned 
perhaps we can all just delete stuff after a set amount of time to 
keep it continuously clear like post stuff for couple weeks then it 
gets moved over to another server like esnips or elsewhere. All good 
ideas. 

I already started my transition and have moved many things over as 
well as deleted. I am considering making a group account that only 
group members can upload to (esnips allows that type of file sharing 
between friends) I just havent had the time or focus to put into 
setting it up (thats alot of emails to type in to add as friends 
LOL). Plus they are in middle of massive changes/updates so waiting 
for the dust to settle. I also considered getting a private server 
sharing system set up so people could upload thier stuff but seems 
complicated for most who arent used to using ftp.

Keep sharing ideas tho because eventually maybe we will make it 
better for everyone.

I rather not set limits on sizes but when ya hit 96% full somethings 
gotta go LOL so we start small and work our way to the resolution. I 
still attach most stuff to my posts for those that get individual 
emails it comes as a simple file attachment in email. So do many 
others here. That also helps.
