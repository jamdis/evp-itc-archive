Descriptions vary: two people said it was &quot;yellow&quot;, one person may have said &quot;straw,&quot; another said &quot;Greek,&quot; and one said &quot;circular.&quot;  I think someone also guessed that it is a bra.  I also heard &quot;petticoat,&quot; although that is a word you don&#39;t hear very often.  I said, &quot;This is exciting!&quot; and someone shot back, &quot;No, it isn&#39;t.&quot;  lol ~Athena~"}
