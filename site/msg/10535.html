&gt; &gt;  So humbling to try to talk to this group with so many years 
&gt; experience, and the intellects! Very humbling! 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  If I may be so bold as the to suggest this voice is Raudive, as 
he 
&gt; has a very distinctive tonal quality. Secondly, there was concerns 
&gt; that little technical advice is received, just my small minded 
&gt; opinion, but we have the electronics, and the boxes in various 
forms 
&gt; work. There is little more to this type of device, except as in 
this 
&gt; voice, some minor tweaking of components.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  &quot;A copper box&quot; go to Radio Shack, buy copper clad circuit 
board, 
&gt; cut to desired size, solder togother with gun type soldering iron 
(I 
&gt; think it&#x27;s 120 and 300 watts). Drill holes for mic and speaker. Of 
&gt; course, that&#x27;s just the way I would do it. There has to be a much 
&gt; simpler, cheaper, and better way. 
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;  Thank your for you time, sorry for the intrusion.
