A true medium can give you a lot of the details that Ouija boards can&#39;t. They can also give you complete names, dates, info that is totally unknown to others (except for those directly involved). \n&gt; There are some excellent readings on YouTube and I don&#39;t mean the crappy ones...I forgot what this one guy&#39;s name was (he is in spirit now) but he could tel you details!!
