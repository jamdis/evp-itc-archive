Science people will tell you there is no astral. The term "Astral" was coin=
ed by the first people who experienced this realm. But all words were coine=
d. Even words such as dog or cat. 

Also, subconscious means below consciou=
s or not conscious. So it isn't incorrect, though maybe some scholarly type=
s will tell you it isn't proper. Again, all words were coined.

You have to=
 remember that colleges and schools are mostly made up by people, people wh=
o think only scientifically. I know-not all people in colleges think this w=
ay, but that is what learning institutions are based on. They reject any te=
rm they can't grasp or understand under a microscope.

All this is besides =
the point though.
