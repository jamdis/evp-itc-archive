until I realized I'd already missed Frank's return *and* his departure.

I don't know if he will come back again. And I won't try to convince 
him.

But if Frank does come back, I hope you all can understand that you 
are all in the same place at this time *because of Frank.*

He doesn't owe anyone an explanation for why he does what he does, 
with whom, and for whom. He doesn't need to believe that anyone is 
more special than anyone or more deserving.

Things *are* getting a little messianic around here, HMO. And the one 
thing I can say from watching this field for 30 years is that 
messiahs come and go and never really are. What is are the little 
glimpses of life after death, in other dimensions, and seemingly all 
around us, invisible. That is the *only* verifiable truth of this, 
HMO: *Something* is out there and it will talk to you, if you let it. 
Beyond that, we are in no way prepared to make definitive statements.

No one should be asking Frank for anything at this point. He should 
be free to gift his boxes on whomever he feels is the one that should 
have it--or not at all.

Before anyone jumps on me, yes, I used to ask for a box from him, 
because there were no other alternatives then and because we had 
known each other on several other lists for about five years and were 
friends.

Bu now there are alternatives--lots of them. Buy a minibox, like I 
did. If that $400 price tag is too heavy, go to Radio Shack and make 
a hack. The radio, rechargeable batteries, and an adaptor cost us $70.

No one should be asking Frank for anything at this point. He should 
be free to gift his boxes on whomever he feels is the one that should 
have it--or on no one at all. He doesn't owe anyone anything. He 
already founded this feast.

Okay, enough out of me. I'm going to go weep in my tea.
