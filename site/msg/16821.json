There is a\n&gt; &gt; different energetic feeling I receive when connecting with someone who has\n&gt; &gt; truly crossed over and is now &quot;in spirit&quot; versus someone who has not.\n&gt; &gt; Those who are stuck either do not realize they have died or they are\n&gt; &gt; attached to our Earth plane (be it a particular person or event) and don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; want to or know how to leave.  I believe it is those stuck individuals who\n&gt; &gt; are often behind the rattle & clatter in hauntings---although this topic is\n&gt; &gt; still new to me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For those who have actually crossed over (and I believe this is the\n&gt; &gt; majority of souls), they return to Spirit and become the light & love they\n&gt; &gt; came from.  Spirits have much better things to do than haunt us, they\n&gt; &gt; continue to learn and evolve on the other side.  However, they do enjoy\n&gt; &gt; communicating with us, especially letting their loved ones know they are ok.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best,\n&gt; &gt; Alyson\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Thu, Mar 4, 2010 at 12:05 PM, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Just like I am skeptical about hauntings, not that I don&#39;t believe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; something is going on, I don&#39;t think there are stuck spirits, so I think\n&gt; &gt;&gt; hauntings are a show for the living.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   On Thu, Mar 4, 2010 at 10:32 AM, Michelle Ayers &lt;diver4skynsea@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Wow, Tom...excellent way to sort and define the differences.

A\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; pseudo Skeptic is characterized by a person who clearly does not know the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; subject area other than through what may be termed &quot;common knowledge&quot; or, at\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; best, a brief overview of the literature.  A  Pseudo skeptic&#39;s &quot;opinions&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; are based primarily on an emotional attitude towards the subject matter\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; rather than what few &quot;facts&quot; he knows.  Its a psychological defense he uses\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to shore up his status, the validity of his work, and to cope with things\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that frighten him.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; A real Skeptic is a friend with a difference of opinion based on a\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; genuine desire to help and sufficient data on the subject at hand to know\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; what he/she is talking about.  We, as Scientists must always have a health\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; dose of real Skepticism.  Otherwise we risk being the exact inverse of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Pseudo skeptic---the &quot;FLAKE&quot;.  The Flake is the type who will believe\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; anything.  Just as the Pseudo Skeptic has a need to reject things on\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; emotional grounds, the Flake has a need to accept EVERYTHING on emotional\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; grounds.  Any shadow,  sound, or corner of the eye flash just HAS to be a\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ghost or spirit. ----or whatever.  I think you know the type, and   these\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;flakes&quot; are what Pseudo skeptics accuse us who are serious about paranormal\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; studies  of being.  Perhaps its one of the reasons they get us so angry.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   *Rj &lt;rasterer@...&gt;*\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Sent by: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 03/04/2010 09:48 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   Please respond to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;    To\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; cc\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   Subject\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Re: [EVP-ITC] What the skepdicks r missing\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   I&#39;ve heard the same said for the evp researchers!  But it&#39;s not that\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; simple in either case:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the last block that you reference has small print that says &quot;Compare the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; hypothesis to the experiment&#39;s conclusion&quot;.  Which of course you can&#39;t do\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; unless you already visited the hypothesis block and have a hypothesis to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; which to compare.  That in turn has small print which says &quot;predict the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; outcome of the problem&quot;, which of course you can&#39;t do either unless you&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; already visited the earlier block of Purpose (&quot;state the problem&quot;).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful to deny good evidence, whether it is good\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; evidence from someone claiming to have detected spirits, or whether it is\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; good evidence from someone claiming that people can mistake noise for speech\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; or random radio tunings for spirit control.  That&#39;s why the scientific\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; method is valuable: it keeps both the skeptic and the believer real.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; --- On *Wed, 3/3/10, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] What the skepdicks r missing [1 Attachment]\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; To: evp-itc@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Date: Wednesday, March 3, 2010, 8:25 PM\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; They all just skip to tbottom.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  F-S\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
