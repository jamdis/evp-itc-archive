Frank,
              I have to agree with you on this.  I have attached some clips 
where I ask  what my roll is.  They advised me of several things.  Some of the  
key words are in the clips and the fact that they acknowledge we need proof 
is  amazing to me.  The tec's as well call them are reflected in the last  clip 
when I asked if I should do a session.  A female say no, and  then proceeds 
to response "you will see".  For whatever its worth, if I  get some sort of 
direction as a response, I comply (by choice and in  reason).  I can't help but 
wonder if sometimes they don't have a best  interest at heart?  Whether they do 
or not, this is extremely exciting to  me, and count my blessing everyday 
that I am was lead on this path and will  continue to follow where ever it takes 
me.

80's and 90's. The words such as tech, gatekeeper,  facilitator, or whatever 
may change but the function remains the same. Don't  get caught up in the

If you are looking for proof, ask  your heart what is real.

this, but I'm not going to.  I will work a bit to digest what  you just told

The  technicians or techs that Bruce and others like to call them are  
facilitators or gatekeepers. They control the window or gate when contact  is made 
or the bridge is activated. A lot of the time you may not even  know who they 
are. My primary guide and gatekeeper does not want to be  identified, which is 
apparent in the message I received when I asked: "It  is not important, just 
know that I love you very much". That is the answer  I got when I asked who my 
primary facilitator was.

I say primary  because there seems to be more than one who will operate the 
"gate". I  catch chatter all the time asking who is on the gate or who is 
operating  the gate and so on. Some are more forceful and controlling than others 
and  some are more liberal on who they let through. Just know it is okay to ask 
 them to limit who is let through, how you would like them to speak  (clearly 
and one at a time) or how you want to be  addressed.

Any idea what "the bridge" signifies in this message?  I have  a connection 
to that term.
