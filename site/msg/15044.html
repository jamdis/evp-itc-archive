So everything can be defined as from one of these forces. Objects from thes=
e forces can omit sound waves.

Does that sound like a correct statement? J=
ust trying to get my mind around it.

        April, standard physics to=

                  Tell me where the seperation on=
 the spectrum takes place between 300Hz and 300KHz. Yes, soundwaves cause p=
ressure waves that our ears read as vibration and our mind translates as so=
und. The waves are still on the electromagnetic spectrum. Even subsonic geo=
magnetic waves are present on the scale. What I mean by power can be direct=
ll translated to volume or amplitude. The only thing that distinguishes sou=
ndwaves from any other wave is the fact that we can hear them.

                          No. Sounds waves are not on the electromagnet spe=

 pressure waves in the air (or in other substances).  Our ears detect these=
 pressure waves and translate them into sounds we here.  Our ear do NOT hea=

                A mistake that a lot of people make is thinking that there =
are two different types of energy at work when it comes to sound waves and =
electromagnetic waves. The only thing that seperates them is frequency and =
power. Radio waves are radio waves because they occupy a certain block of t=
he electromagnietic spectrum. Sound waves exist on that same spectrum just =
farther down with much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic waves can pene=
trate almost anything because of their wavelengths. The shorter the wavelen=
gth the more ways we can shield against them.

                            =
    Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and telemetry trans=
mitting wave but the waves also have a physical effect on our environment b=
y causing molecules to speed up, which creates heat. A little lower than th=
is is IR or infrared it too can cause physical objects to heat up but usual=
ly it just causes molecules to rotate in place. All physical things give of=
f IR light. Its a way the total system conserves energy by spontaneously em=
itting IR radiation.

                                Here=
 is some food for thought. I am currently reviewing my audio from our May 3=
0th investigation.

                                It was me and another g=
irl teammate present in the room. I picked up a 3rd female voice on my digi=
tal voice recorder that I carry with me. We were standing right next to ano=
ther digital video recorder that I leave beside my night vision camera. Tha=
t recorder did not pick up this 3rd voice. I have asked the girl that was w=
ith me to check her recording to see if she picked it up.

                =
                I have long felt the true EVP does not come from sound wave=
s in the environment, or then it wouldn't be EVP, but a disembodied voice. =
Somehow EVP's are appearing directly on the recordings.

                  =
              This instance with the recorders may back that theory up. Tha=
t other recorder should have picked that voice up if it were sound waves in=
 the environment.

                                I am attaching the clip =
of this 3rd voice. The file that is named "01-02-17 Clip" is the full clip.=
 You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah", and then another comes in right af=
ter that. I think I know what it says.

                                Aga=
in, I was live monitoring my audio, but still did not hear this until playb=
ack. It isn't clear, so I am not as excited about it as my one's from the l=

                                I have a run=
ning theory that EVP is carried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exact=
ly where they want it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. I=
f you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequency then if=
 you add or subtract them together you get a beat frequency or alternate fr=
equency. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have =
an electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then yo=
u will have a intermediate difference frequency at 9KHz, well within human =
hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic=
 equipment generates ultrasonic signals just by turning them on. From this =
theory I always felt that EVP were generated within a few inches of the rec=
order.

                                We are able to reproduce this affec=
t in not only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with acoustics an=
d audio as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce called the "audi=

A mistake that a lot of people make is

        electromagnetic waves. The only thing that

                    =
            waves are radio waves because they occupy a

            =

   =
                             and subsonic waves can penetrate almost anythi=
