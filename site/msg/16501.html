<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>If any of those people who&#x27;d made comments in response to the &quot;challenge&quot; had had my experiences, they might change their minds.  For instance once, when I asked if it was OK to wrap up the session, I was very clearly told &quot;Turn off the device.&quot;  Clear as day and in direct response to my question.  No hearing what I want there. 

Then again, if any of those commenters had an open enough mind to hear anything at all, I would be surprised.

&gt;  I wouldn&#x27;t bother with that crap, there&#x27;s no way anyone is going to get an
&gt; honest eval from Randi.
&gt; 
&gt;  To me, you judge a box, or anything else by what it&#x27;s personal meaning is.
&gt; Do the messages have meaning and coherence, or are they just random
&gt; disconnected words? When I here my name, and the names of others through to
&gt; box, I&#x27;d have to be a real duffus to think that was just broadcast
&gt; fragments.
