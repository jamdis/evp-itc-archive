Im replying to two topics here, two birds with one stone so to speak.
   
  It's a public forum and you dont have to be a member to read the posts here yet so anyone can freely read whats said and probably only have to join to post.
   
   The Grassharp group is not responsible for the actions of the few so let's just leave thier group name out of your arguments. Even tho I havent rejoined the group yet I plan to do so some day because there are some really nice people there and it is not thier fault that all of this has happened anymore than its mine or the others on this group.  
   
  As for the hate mail you are getting, I told yall just stop replying to it LOL it takes two to make a war and only one to end it. See that button that says delete...use it my friends it can come in handy.
   
  Peace was always a better concept than war anyway

          Apparently we still have one or more Grass Harp duffus spies here 
reporting back everyword to their hypocite leader. Guess they have to 
sneak onto other groups cuz they can't get their own voices, and 
spirit contacts. Needless to say, I'm still getting hate mail from 
these vile little minds. I might have to start screening new members.
