<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve been with people who do protections and some who don&#x27;t and my  
personal feeling is that it&#x27;s not religion that matters so much as the  
intention of the person(s) reciting the words. It could be Catholic or  
Hebrew or Hindi or Wiccan, to me it&#x27;s the good energy that&#x27;s released  
for protection. A lot of psychics will try to send a white light for  
protection, and to me it&#x27;s the same thing as prayer. I spent a little  
time with Chip Coffey at the Waverly in August, and he does protection  
before investigating plus others are known to do it after to tell  
spirits they are not welcome to hitch a ride back home with you.

&gt; &gt; As someone who has never used a protection ritual (even though I  
&gt; consider
&gt; &gt; myself a very spiritual person), I&#x27;m not sure I understand what  
&gt; the ritual
&gt; &gt; is intended to protect the person invoking it from. I&#x27;m not being  
&gt; a smart
&gt; &gt; ass; I&#x27;m simply trying to learn. Can we be hurt physically or  
&gt; psychically
&gt; &gt; by certain spirits, or can our experimentation open a dark portal  
&gt; that&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; not meant to be opened? My instinct has always been that if I don&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; acknowledge evil it can have no power over me, but perhaps that&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; ignorant. I once invited spirits into my house from outside and
&gt; &gt; immediately recorded a negative EVP while heating a cup of coffee  
&gt; in the
&gt; &gt; microwave. I was too ecstatic to be frightened by the message, but  
&gt; since
&gt; &gt; then I&#x27;ve wondered what kind of spirit would want to say such a  
&gt; thing to
&gt; &gt; me and if I should be more cautious in the future. I would love some
&gt; &gt; feedback on this recording.

&gt; &gt; Bad idea! In my opinion. You just create fear with that crap, and
&gt; &gt; fear feeds itself. Once again, you will create what you expect to
&gt; &gt; get. If you use protection BS, you&#x27;ll have convinced yourself that
&gt; &gt; there is something to be affraid of, and so you will tend to creat a
&gt; &gt; thoughtform to fulfill that expectation.

&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have written up the short protection ritual I use before every
&gt; &gt; &gt; session, I have been using it for quite a while now and have had  
&gt; no
&gt; &gt; &gt; problems with dark heads other than the occasional curse word.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend that all researchers experienced and new use this or a
&gt; &gt; &gt; similar protection ritual before every box session if you are not
&gt; &gt; &gt; already.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; hey it&#x27;s better to have it and not need it , than need it and not
&gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; it!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I will post it in the files section in a folder marked
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;protection ritual&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks guy&#x27;s
