I was \nlistening to Mike&#39;s show online on my office computer (I only have dial-\nup at my home computer).  Great show, Mike, especially for those of us \nnew to ghost boxes.\n\nHappy New Year,\nSharon\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Got an hour to listen to my latest internet radio show while you work \n&gt; or play on your computer? I talk about the new methods used to make \n&gt; communication attempts with entities & spirits and the other devices \nI \n&gt; have been building (Micro Box and Shadow Detection).\n&gt; Then I demonstrate each of the 5 different Radio Shack Hack Ghost Box \n&gt; System configurations I have put together in recent weeks. Hear some \n&gt; for the first time on my show Ghost to Ghost PM.\n&gt; Hear it here:  http://www.ghosttoghostpm.com\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt;"}
