<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for the feedback everyone!  I&#x27;ll be interested to see what 
rolls in through the TAPS magazine.  The issue will be featured next 
weekend at the next Ghost Hunters haunted event, at Eastern State 
Penitentiary in Philly.  People will be getting it, and it&#x27;s sure to 
generate some converation. (Bill, Randy &amp; I will be there).  BTW, 
Randy alerted me that the hot link for the pdf includes a period 
which makes it not work, and I don&#x27;t know how to edit the original 
post, so I would suggest highlighting &amp; cutting the period out.  My 
apologies.  I fixed it on itcbridge.com under Forum/EVP/Ghost Box.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Mark Macy has posted two articles I wrote about Frank&#x27;s Box,
&gt; &gt; &gt;concerning the controversy the box has caused in the paranormal
&gt; &gt; &gt;investigation community.  The articles are published this month 
in
&gt; &gt; &gt;TAPS Paramagazine.  The pdf can be viewed at
&gt; &gt; &gt;http://spiritfaces.com/x200706ParamagArticl.pdf.  For those not 
in
&gt; &gt; &gt;ghost work, TAPS is The Paranormal Atlantic Society, members of 
whom
&gt; &gt; &gt;star in The SciFiChannel&#x27;s  popular Ghost Hunters reality show.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Briefly, at a Ghost Hunters haunted week at The Stanley Hotel in
&gt; &gt; &gt;Colorado in March, the 200+ attendees were given demonstrations 
of
&gt; &gt; &gt;the box by Chris Moon.  There were two open mike nights in which 
lots
&gt; &gt; &gt;were drawn for people to come up and ask questions via the box.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Chris interpreted answers, and was assisted by medium Chip 
Coffey.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Many of the attendees had never heard of the box, and most of 
them
&gt; &gt; &gt;had never seen it in operation, and it caused quite a stir.   
Chris
&gt; &gt; &gt;also took the box into one of the hotel&#x27;s more active haunted 
rooms,
&gt; &gt; &gt;as part of the featured ghost investigations.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;There were two other boxes present on site for part of the time,
&gt; &gt; &gt;owned by Randy Schneider and Bill Murphy.  Fortunately, these 
boxes
&gt; &gt; &gt;were not pressed into service for paranormal tap dancing.  I was
&gt; &gt; &gt;especially happy to be able to participate in small group private
&gt; &gt; &gt;sessions with both Randy and Bill (and one of which included 
Mark),
&gt; &gt; &gt;which I found far more illuminating.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;One article concerns the controversy over the box (for example,
&gt; &gt; &gt;should it be used in haunted places to provoke ghosts; can it 
dial up
&gt; &gt; &gt;the dead on demand), and the other is a Q&amp;A interview I did with
&gt; &gt; &gt;Frank.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Personally, I agree with Frank&#x27;s vision for the box as an ITC 
tool.
