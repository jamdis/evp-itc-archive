AM is the kicker.=A0 With amplitude modulation, and high power (being close=
 to the tower) any device will pick up those voices.

AM basically is the s=
ame as real speech except that the carrier is not air but a relatively high=
 frequency EMF.=A0 FM does not have this problem because the words and musi=
c are created by varying the frequency and not the amplitude.=A0 (a primer =
for those not into the geeky side of radio)

            That close to a commercial transmitter, any device i=

are pretty tight against RF interference at higher frequencie=

suck at high power long/medium wave signal rejection, especially a=
