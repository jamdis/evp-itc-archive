&gt; Hi, my name is Wes Kellington, and I am from Waynesboro, VA.  This 
is my
&gt; second post since joining the group
&gt; on March 1.
&gt; 
&gt; I came here specifically to listen and learn from Frank Sumption 
and to
&gt; likeminded individuals.  I am a ham radio operator,
&gt; although I have not been active in years since the CB&#x27;ers kind of 
took over
&gt; with their new no-code rules, and am a
&gt; computer technician.  I have been passionately pursuing paranormal 
interests
&gt; since I was a child.  So, Frank, please
&gt; keep on supplying us with your knowledge and foresight.  I look 
forward to
&gt; your posts; and I read all of them.
&gt; 
&gt; I read all the posts, even by the guy with the gall to ask for 
someone to
&gt; send him a radio.  Yes, I would give anything
&gt; to have one; but I would not dare ask someone to do that for me.  
That&#x27;s
&gt; just wrong!  And as far as threatening
&gt; personal emails, what the Hell has been the matter with people?  My 
wife is
&gt; the business manager of a local
&gt; psychiatric practice.  The day of the full moon, they had more 
patients and
&gt; admitted more people to the psychiatric
&gt; wing of the hospital than ever!
&gt; 
&gt; This is off-topic.  I have been dealing with a personal problem for 
the past
&gt; several weeks.  I had a chest X-ray; and
&gt; on it they found a 2.5 cm nodule in one of my lungs.  My catscan is 
May 8th
&gt; to make sure I do not have lung cancer.
&gt; The waiting is killing me.  It&#x27;s like being on death row and 
waiting to see
&gt; if the phone rings.  So, I have not had the
&gt; energy to do anything lately.  I am only waiting...
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully, there will be a positive outcome, and then I can delve 
into this
&gt; further and begin some research of my own.
&gt; 
&gt; Frank, please stick around.
&gt; 
&gt; Wes
