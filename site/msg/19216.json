The oscillator coil is too small, so\nit gets the very top of the band, here the last station is 107.5MHZ. So,\nsweeping above the FM seems to result in --something--, mostly I think it&#39;s\npick up in the IF stages of the radio, but at 1 second &quot;Hi--something&quot;.\n\n\n The tuning capacitor values are not given in the data sheet, so it&#39;s guess\nas to what varactor to use, with this version it&#39;s two 13.5 pf varactors\nback to back--or in series, so probably need to add some caps in parallel to\nbring to oscillator frequency down. Just one of the varactors covered close\nto half the band, but the tuning voltage range was less that a volt. Think\nI&#39;ll try a larger coil first. Just as easy to make this sweep below the band\nas well.\n\n F-S\n\nTes ing a home made AM/FM une on FM.
