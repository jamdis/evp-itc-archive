I  \n\nthought, &quot;now I am finally going to find out what really happened and  \n\nbe awed by the incredible evidence.&quot; Only Mark&#39;s book offered none of  \n\nthat for me. I was just looking at the customer reviews for the book  \n\non Amazon, because I thought I had written a review of it there at  \n\nthe time. I didn&#39;t, but here is one from someone who pretty much sums  \n\nup what I think about it: &quot;Macy&#39;s book focuses mainly on the  \n\npersonality conflicts that undermined an attempt at high-tech  \n\ncommunications with the spirit world. His style is readable and  \n\nbrisk, his tone sincere and unaffected, but he provides little or no  \n\nevidence that the phenomena he describes are authentic. The main  \n\nresearchers he depicts come off more as enthusiastic dilettantes than  \n\nserious scientists. For me, Macy forfeits nearly all credibility when  \n\nhe casually declares that the history of the human race can be  \n\nunderstood by integrating some of the spirit communications with the  \n\nwritings of Erich von Daniken (p.140)! Von Daniken, of CHARIOTS OF  \n\nTHE GODS fame, is an entirely discredited huckster. If Macy can be  \n\npersuaded by von Daniken&#39;s pop-culture writings, he will probably  \n\nbelieve just about anything. There is an unfortunate messianic tone  \n\npervading the book - the message that a new dawn of humanity is  \n\ncoming, courtesy of the spirit communicators and the mortals who  \n\nspread their message. You&#39;ll probably find MIRACLES IN THE STORM  \n\nenjoyable and easy to read (hence three stars), but it will convince  \n\nno one who isn&#39;t already a believer.&quot;\n\n\n\nI mentioned $cientology wryly, and I should have put in a ;) or  \n\nsomething--my bad--but I do stand by the similarity in message and  \n\ntone. I&#39;m not conflating the two, I&#39;m just pointing out what makes me  \n\nwary, and the sentence, &quot;our progress toward a free, wealthy and sane  \n\nfuture in which humanity would have stripped off the chains of  \n\nintolerance and cruelty&quot; is especially redolent.\n\n\n\nIn short, while I do believe that we all need to evolve into more  \n\nloving and spiritual beings, and I have tried all my life to do so  \n\nwith a few limited successes, I still find that becoming &quot;better&quot; is  \n\nnot tantamount to becoming less critical or buying into every  \n\nmessiah&#39;s momentum. As I&#39;ve said before, I want to believe, but I  \n\nwill not believe only because I want to. And I&#39;m not even saying that  \n\nthe whole INIT thing was a fraud. It wasn&#39;t. But I do think that  \n\nthere are aspects of it that were, or that were highly inflated. And  \n\nwe have to be honest about that or we can&#39;t really be honest about  \n\nwhat is unshakable in paranormal research.\n\n\n\nAnd this is just my own opinion, and we know what opinions are like,  \n\nand perhaps I am one.
