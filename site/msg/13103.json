I could \nhear the DJ talking, the intros to the music he gave, the music, the \nconnercials, everything.  I doubt you are only going to get a single word \nor few words from a radio station close by if it is getting into your \nunit.

At a quarter mile away or more I couldn&#39;t hear it in \nthe recording.  I also tried the local police and some microwave towers, \nright under the towers, and heard nothing from those sources. But they \nare on much higher frequencies than AM or FM radio and are not known to \nget into any electronics around here.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Mon, 15 Dec 2008, Tom Arnold wrote:\n\n&gt; To The Group,\n&gt; �� This as stated prior this puts in to question everybodys evp&#39;s that have been recorded.Because how can people tell if it is a am or fm or cell phone or cb or ham radio that they hear.It could be just about anything that uses the airwaves.

That way we know where everyone is at all times. So far this\n&gt;&gt; has been successful for us. This method assumes a level of\n&gt;&gt; responsibility and respect on the part of the investigators - I have\n&gt;&gt; found that if you are doing an event where others and the public are\n&gt;&gt; invited it is essential to have them see the schedule and agree to\n&gt;&gt; abide by it when they sign up and then again when they arrive.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Laurie\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Luis Gonzalez&quot; &lt;almovadar@. ..&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Sent: Saturday, December 13, 2008 11:40pm\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Of Radio Interference and equipment...\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Tom,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I own a Motorola Razor.
