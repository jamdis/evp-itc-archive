I have one of a handful of the Edison Autobiography that has the last ch=

Anyw=

PS but don't spend alot.=A0 The info in the last chapter is=
 not worth much.

            I suppose ultimately, it doesn't really matter if Edison=

have to stand on their own results anyway, and if they've managed to

d=
iscover something that Edison never achieved, good for them!



I have also=
 heard varied claims: that Edison did make this box; that

Edison was worki=
ng on it but never finished it; that Edison was joking

when he mentioned w=
orking on it.  So for my own sake, I'd like to know

the real story.



If =
you have a link to where you got your information from his

assistants and =
staff, I would really like to read it.  Please make

sure it is as close to=
 the source material as possible, and not

someone quoting someone quoting =
an article.  For example, here is a

link to the actual New York times arti=
cle on Edison discussing his

views of life after death:

That is the kind of link I'd be hoping for regarding y=
