<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Folks,

Recently I did an investigation at the Lincoln Theater in Decatur, IL
with my Mini-Box, and got some interesting clips from the basement
area.  The files are too large to be uploaded to the forum here, but a
short video with the audio clips has been posted on You Tube by Joey
Tito, a Chicago researcher who filmed the investigation.  The audio
clips are at the end, and Joey matched them to a transcript of what I
picked up.  I sent the clips to Frank, and he picked up even more.

The You Tube link is www.youtube.com/xflexx1  Joey has a short version
and a long version; pick the short one.

I have a report on the investigation posted on my blog on MySpace at
www.myspace.com/rosemaryellenguiley  and Joey&#x27;s video is on my home
page there as well.  The blog also has my report on a similar
investigation at Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield; the clips from
that are posted on this forum in my folder.

Regards,
Rosemary</pre>
