I will see if I can ask them to speak as one,  \nbecause I think you hit the nail right on the head -- I do hear them speaking  \nover each other, half in male, half in female, so maybe things would improve  \nlike you said if they organized into one collective voice. Can they still  \nanswer questions about individuals this way, or are you limited to \ngeneralized  queries?\n\nRegarding your statement: &quot;Quite often when a new  speaker\ncomes forth a bit of a training session can be heard for how they  can\nspeak so that my physical self can hear what is said.&quot; So by this, do  you \nmean it&#39;s possible it takes a couple of sessions for the entity to master  \nthis new method of communication? For instance, I got my grandmother&#39; s name  \n(among others) during Tuesday&#39;s session, but she said nothing, wouldn&#39;t \nanswer  our questions; Wednesday, she suddenly started talking and was the \nprimary  person we communicated with, even correctly answered my mother&#39;s \nquestions  about her childhood pets. Could this be because there&#39;s a learning \ncurve  involved with talking through the radio? Does it take a session or two \nbefore  they &quot;get the hang of it&quot;? Or is it all dependent on my skills?\n\nOh, and  wanted to say I&#39;m going out tomorrow to buy all the canned goods \nat the  grocery store in anticipation of the nuclear winter we are about to \nendure...  Just kidding. Hearing about all that stuff they are predicting, it \ndoes make  me wonder, though, why they would go to such trouble to tell you \nall that  again and again -- what&#39;s to gain from it? It&#39;s not stirring \nanybody up.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n-------------------------------1250255438\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3DUS-ASCII&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Type&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18812&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot; id=3Drole_body =\r\n\nbottomMargin=3D7 leftMargin=3D7 rightMargin=3D7 topMargin=3D7&gt;&lt;FONT id=3Dr=\r\nole_document \ncolor=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;did you play your=\r\n file back ?&nbsp; if you recorded it I would bet there \nwas all kinds of i=\r\nnfo on it, sometimes they start, at least for me, they started \nlike more e=\r\nvp&#39;s&nbsp; then real time, now they do both, and at times,&nbsp;they \nare a=\r\nll chating at once it seems.&nbsp; I think they are talking to each other, =\r\n\nnot just to us. sf&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In a message dated 8=\r\n/14/2009 8:53:51 A.M.
