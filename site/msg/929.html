<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The file came through very clear Frank. It would be great to have instructions on modifying a modern radio like you mentioned. I don&#x27;t think I have a radio in the house any newer then 1979 vintage (ha). BTW I am still testing the manual linear &#x27;spin&#x27; technique. The faster the spin of the dial the more &#x27;spikey&#x27; the voices become. Makes me wonder if modulated pulses chosen randomly would also work. I have a crude 5 channel optical switch and will test this theory during the weekend.

I don;t like the way the image looks after converting to jpeg, all smudgy, 
so I&#x27;m seeing if zipping is more better. I used Freezip.

This one is re-drawn from scratch, using the original trangle generator 
schematic I found on line for reference. I added the output buffer, made the 
frequency adjustable, and use a different chip for it. This is what I do for 
all my circuits, modifying as needed.

The point of this circuit is to use Retro Dave&#x27;s limear tuning experiment 
with voltage tunable radios, incase anyone has one like I use lying 
around.......doh. Think I&#x27;m going to have to do a proceedure on modifying an 
existing radio for voltage tuning.
