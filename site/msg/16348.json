After watching &quot;White Noise&quot;\n&gt; awhile back, one day I turned on a recorder and turned a radio tuner while\n&gt; asking if &quot;anyone&quot; would like to talk. To my great surprise, I found voices\n&gt; immediately after uploading and playing the file. I know about evps from\n&gt; watching the Ghost Hunters, but these voices were talking to me in a\n&gt; conversational tone and about stuff relational to questions I asked and to\n&gt; stuff I was doing at the time! This progressed over time into a running\n&gt; &quot;conversation&quot; with apparently living beings who are invisible but somehow\n&gt; sharing this house! Can someone here please relieve my anxiety a bit? I&#39;m\n&gt; wondering if I&#39;m messing with something that I shouldn&#39;t be messing with.\n&gt; What are the consequences of this -- and can anyone enlighten me about the\n&gt; rules or protocol for dealing with these invisible people? And, has anyone\n&gt; found there is NO WAY to talk about this without sounding crazy??\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Al\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nTell us mo e please.ThanksDa eOn Sa , No 28, 2009 a 2:59 PM, Alo bama alge ha is@...> w o e:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÂ \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n Hi, my name is Al, and I'm new o his lis .
