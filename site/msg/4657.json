Whether the seller knew it had a \nproblem or not is one for the guessing game.  If the seller used the \nphone on a regular basis, more than just turning it on, I&#39;m sure \nhe/she knew of the short charge time... but if they just deal on ebay \nin used phones they may have just done a quick funtional test and \nthen turned the phone off, not knowing the problem existed, then \nputting it on ebay.\n\nAnyway... to the problem itself.  I&#39;m assuming from your post that \nthe phone does work, but will just not work for very long, draining \nthe battery within a very short period of time.\nIf this is the case, (IMHO) I have to wonder where they get \nthe &quot;water damage&quot; explanation from..??  Now, water can damage a \npiece of electronics equipment if the equipment is on when the water \nmakes contact.  The water could act like a conductor and make \nconnections internally where connections would not normally be made, \ncausing components to go bad because of excess current, voltage, etc.\nBut, if a unit is off, water may or may not do damage depending if \nthere is something that can be damaged just by getting wet (like \nspeakers, etc.)\nBut, since your unit appears to work, just draining the battery to \nquickly... I have a very hard time understanding the &quot;water damage&quot; \nthing they told you.\n\nSince a new battery is doing the same thing as the old, that phone is \ndraining the battery because something, which uses a lot of current, \nappears to be on all the time, or something is being shorted (or \nturned on) causing current drain (even if the phone appears to be \noff), while still allowing the phone to function while on.\n\nWhat that exact problem is can not be guessed from afar though.\n\nSorry I couldn&#39;t be more specific.  I hope this helps a bit.\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robin Henson&quot; &lt;MudPuddleFarm@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I apologize up front for this, but it occurred to me some of you \n&gt; electronics nuts might be able to give me a definitive answer about \na \n&gt; bad purchase I made through Ebay a few months ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; My kid desperately wanted this particular phone for his birthday, \nso \n&gt; I \n&gt; bid and &quot;won&quot; it.  Described as brand new, box never opened, yada \n&gt; yada.  It arrived in seemingly perfect condition, and it took about \na \n&gt; week for us to get it through our pea brains that it wasn&#39;t holding \na \n&gt; charge. There was a lot going on around the house, and probably \n&gt; another \n&gt; couple of weeks went by before I decided it just needed a new \n&gt; battery. \n&gt; So I replaced the battery and got a cute little phone case to boot. \n&gt; \n&gt; You might guess that the new battery didn&#39;t solve the problem.  By \n&gt; this \n&gt; time I had been in contact with the seller, who seemed genuinely \n&gt; sympathetic and suggested I send it back to Cingular/ATT since it \nwas \n&gt; still &quot;on warranty&quot; (yeah, right).  Instead, I sent it to an online \n&gt; cellphone repair company that promised they could repair any kind \nof \n&gt; damage for $29.95.  Two weeks later they contacted me and said they \n&gt; were very sorry but the phone had suffered irrepairable water \ndamage, \n&gt; and they could dispose of it for me and give me a $15. credit \ntowards \n&gt; merchandise or send it back.  I had them send it back, probably \njust \n&gt; to \n&gt; torment myself with the reminder that altogether I wasted close to \n&gt; $350.!!! I just kept digging the hole deeper and deeper..\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, I did contact Ebay and PayPal, but I had waited too long to \nfile \n&gt; a \n&gt; formal complaint with either company because I simply couldn&#39;t get \nit \n&gt; through my head that someone would misrepresent what they were \n&gt; selling.  \n&gt; \n&gt; So my question is, IS IT TRUE A WATER-LOGGED CELLPHONE CAN&#39;T BE \n&gt; FIXED??  \n&gt; \n&gt; Robin\n&gt;"}
