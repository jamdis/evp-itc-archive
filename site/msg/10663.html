Sticking my 2 cents in!
 
Since first being introduced to Franks's Box several years ago, I immediately became curious and was drawn to the voices in which eluminated from the box.  I had no idea of how this could possiblly work or in fact why it does.  As time progressed I realized that in my opinion that somethings are not ment to be explained and faith could actually play an important roll in not only this form of communication but in our everday lives.  I look back on how I came to have gotten involved in the paranormal community and know had I not made certain life choices I would not be where I am now with real time communication.  
 
In the beginning I truly believed and supported a man who had several of Frank's Boxes. As time progressed I unfortnately seen  a good man with good intentions turn in a different direction and over the edge. Financial revenue and his ego became the most important thing to him, and those who chose not to support his new endeavors, severed their ties with him, and became the subject of hate mail and nasty phone calls.  As a a result, many people today have formed an oppinion regarding two way communication and box research because of their dislike for this man.  I have gotten in countless debates with people regarding my strong convictions, and although we still in the end disagree, I can only hope that my theories on the subject possbility opened up their minds just a little that there could be more than meets the eye.  I have given up the notion that I could sway them beyond a shadow of a doubt, and know that the the only thing that matters is that I
 stay true to myself and continue to follow the path in which I believe I was to take.  
 
Many times I felt very guilty because I was mislead as well as others and almost felt obligated to try and fix or repair the damage that this individual has done in misleading people.  I thought if there was just one person I could help regardless of what it was, then maybe all of the scruteny we have be subject to has not been in vain.  I don't know if there is a roll to be played with this communication, or not, but if there is, then just maybe those on the otherside know are intension are pure and that no matter what, we already have faith in the communication.

I know I will never be able to verify who I am speaking with, or even if the messages are true, (I can only assume).  If there is one thing I do know for sure, is if in fact this is real communication from the otherside we are truly blessed to see what others choose not to.
 
I have attached two files of audio from the case that I have been asked to work on from the families advocate.  These are questions that Mike Edwards asked and for the record the names were verified in the case as well as the messages.  It's responses like this that certainly give me hope that what was originally started as curiousity of voices through a box just maybe could help in bringing a child home.
 
Thanks Again Mike for you help and efforts!
 
Juli

To add to that.
 
Kay, since starting box research this past January, 2008, I have had one close friend already tell me the responses are nothing but CB or two way radio traffic, and another close friend who is devout Catholic said that I am speaking to the devil. Go figure. 
 
My wife listened to the recordings and says she can not hear the responses.
 
I no longer discuss box research outside the EVP/Paranormal friendships I have.
 
Its just like UFO's. Some people believe they exist and others believe they are military test vehicles.
 
For the past week and a half, I have been assisting Juli in a missing person case, and have been doing the box recordings for her. I conected with the boy right away who has been missing for over a year, and the info he has given us is info only the police detectives know, as it has not been released to the press. The boy has answered every question posed to him.
 
Either you believe in spirit contact or you do not. Some people believe in God and others do not. 
 
It seems to me the people that do not believe in spirit contact whether through a medium, box devices or personal experiences, are those that have never had an experience.
 
I have had a handful since my youth and adult life, and from the first one I had, I was hooked and never looked back.

Hi Kay. Your boyfriend's opinion is one of the reasons why I put great weight on relevance 
of content in a session. For example, when I recently asked for Rees' great uncle to say 
his name, and an immediate reply of "It's Chuck Clarke" is heard (even though Rees 
referred to him as Charlie, both are nicknames for Charles) I think the odds would be quite 
astronomical of that being coincidence. Same goes for any of us asking a question, any 
question, and receiving a relevant response ... it would be highly unlikely for it to be from 
stray signals (of whatever flavor.) 

Then again, if he has trouble even hearing and/or agreeing on the content, it's going to be 
hard for you to get him to view an answer as relevant, even when it is.
