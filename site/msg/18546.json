Some tuners have different sweep requirements for each band, so\n&gt; sometimes have to add a pot to adjust the max level for one of the bands.\n&gt; AM=530 to 1710 Khz and FM 88.5 to 108mhz, but you don&#39;t have to cover the\n&gt; entire band, all that is required is enough to provide the raw audio bits\n&gt; the entities use to make their voices.\n&gt; \n&gt;  A Danish researcher back in the 80s was just &quot;wobbling&quot; between a couple\n&gt; stations to make contact. His name was Stein and there&#39;s more info on the\n&gt; German VTF site. Stein also has his sweep circuit there.\n&gt; \n&gt;  The best sounding systems seem to be the way Steve Hultay makes his, by\n&gt; adding sweep to a complete radio. see keyportparanormal.com. I take the\n&gt; tuners out of the radio, and supply my own amplifier and sweep. At present\n&gt; I&#39;m making a box using a Timex clock radio tuner, the triangle sweep, and\n&gt; computer sound amplifier and speaker system for the bass response. I just\n&gt; started this project yesterday. I use Timex model T309T AM/FM/nature sounds\n&gt; clock radios when I can find them in thrift stores cheap. I found a Timex\n&gt; model T313T this morning, and hoping it has the seperate tuner board inside,\n&gt; as the 300 series has so far.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I used to use car stereo tuner modules, but those tend to be too noisy. Box\n&gt; 13, that Hultay just got back is based on a car tuner. He did a YouTube\n&gt; video of it.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I&#39;m still pretty much an amateur at this, there are so many variables.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Aug 20, 2010 at 6:35 PM, Luis &lt;luispucp098@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am very glad for your atention Frank , i will make a box and i need it be\n&gt; &gt; very good , for best results .
