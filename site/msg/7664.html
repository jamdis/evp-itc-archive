<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Mike.  You have a couple options.  You can use this free converter program (I&#x27;ve not 
tried it but have read from others that it&#x27;s good):

http://www.softwarepile.com/audio_converter.html

Or you can play the file into Audacity via a patch cord from the ear jack of your recorder to 
your sound-in jack on your computer (rather than transferring the file using the USB).  If 
you want to export a file from Audacity as an MP3, you will also need to download and 
install the LAME add-on.  

http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/

Hope this helps some.

&gt; I used my 12-469 for the first time this morning, and ran a 4 minute tape session. One 
of the questions I asked was, &quot;When a person dies, do they see a white light?&quot;  After I 
asked this question the second time, I got a very distinct and crisp YES.  How can I save 
just that section of the file? Do I need to do that in the recorder, or can I do it in the .wave 
file I now have saved on my computer of the whole recording.
