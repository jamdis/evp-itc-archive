It must be a Class B, then, as I am hearing "husband".  That fits with 
the other one where he says I'm his wife.  He has been trying to 
convince me for over a year that I am the reincarnation of his long dead 
spouse, so I was quite intrigued to get these as some of the results 
from my very first day trying ITC work.

Or it could just be that I have been nagging him to hear his voice.  
Like I said, I'd never managed to get even one evp out of him in 15 
months of trying.  He's pretty clever, so I couldn't imagine that he 
couldn't figure out how to.  The sense I was getting from him was that 
since he was shot through the throat during the Civil War, he was 
concerned that he would sound scary if I ever heard him.  It actually 
means a lot to me that he finally let me hear him in his own voice.  I 
guess he now trusts me not to freak out.  As if I ever did.

Thanks!  Actually, it was your site that convinced me to break down and 
give ITC work a try.
