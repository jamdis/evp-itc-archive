I can&#39;t hear much beyond that. If anyone can,\nhave a \n&gt; tech check the power supply voltages at the board, there should be\nplus and \n&gt; minus 12 volts for the RVG, and pus 12 for the audio/tuner section.\nLook at \n&gt; it with a scope, maybe there a bad regulator, or bad power switch\nsection. \n&gt; The way it is, that box is about useless.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Messenger Caf  open for fun 24/7.
