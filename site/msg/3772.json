I personally don&#39;t like to focus \non evil entities, even though I believe 100% that lower astrals \nexist. Not only that, Tibetan shamans, among others, have repeatedly \nshown that thought forms can be given form and a measure of life. \n\nThe way I see it, if we keep a higher focus, such things as rage, \nhate, and destruction among other things will be far removed. Ouija \nBoards have many times been the source of horrible experiences. Just \nfrom listening to all the hundreds of callers on C2C over the years, \nI&#39;d say over 95% of the stories weren&#39;t good. \n\nGeorge did make a good statement to the effect that it&#39;s not good \ngiving a loaded gun to a child.  \n\nLance\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, lisby@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; He may very well have changed it. Maybe he&#39;ll tell us why himself, \nif he chooses, since he&#39;s a list member.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can I ask you what personal experiences you have had with evil \nentities that make you so concerned? Not other people&#39;s alledged \nexperiences, but your own? I&#39;m really curious. It&#39;s not a trap of any \nkind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt;From: babiarz3 &lt;babiarz3@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Dec 3, 2007 6:35 AM\n&gt; &gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: MiniBox - General Recommendations\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Not misinformation. The page has been changed as of Dec 3rd! \nImagine\n&gt; &gt;that. The article did indeed state that children and high school\n&gt; &gt;students would be part of the testing groups as well as skeptic,\n&gt; &gt;believers, etc. \n&gt; &gt;Yes I did notice the discrepancy between the asup article and the\n&gt; &gt;disclaimers on the paranormal sytems page. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, so much for the &quot;Oh Noes!1!!

Do not allow children under the age of 16 to use this device\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2. Although individual sessions are effective, group sessions \nare more\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; productive.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 3. This is not an &#39;electronic Ouija board&#39; - no harm can come \nfrom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; using it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 4. Some voices will use coarse language so be prepared for it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 5. Always use a recorder to tape all sessions\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 6. Keep a notebook with the times and locations of your \nsessions.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 7. The MiniBox will call you by name so don&#39;t be startled by \nit.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Lance\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
