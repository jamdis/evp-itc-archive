<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Wasn&#x27;t the definition of insanity--doing the same thing over and over an
expecting different results--? Random mode is a little fast, as I only have
one setting for it at the moment. There is a tiny amount of white noise
mixed with the audio, as if I need that here.

 Linear aM seems to start out &quot;I will speak to---&quot; can&#x27;t make out the rest.
Then at 4 seconds &quot;this is good&quot;, they seem to make use of the white noise,
but this is only the first test.
