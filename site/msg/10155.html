All good points chuck.=A0 I am wondering what your reaction is to the quest=
ioner who gets an immediate and appropriate response to his question as Mik=
e just did regarding equipment.=A0 His question was well designed and the r=
esponse was direct and immediate.=A0 He would then have time to "just liste=
n" no?=A0 Can't we do both?=A0 Ask, as times, and listen at other times?=A0=
 Also, Frank, I know you discussed this in the past but what has the histor=
y of SW radio usage and EVP results?=A0 Ron L

Frank=
, I understand where you are coming from, as I often get 
frustrated when I=
 hear myself or another asking a question and there 
is an answer within th=
e same audio from the spirits. So I agree with 
this. I only hear about 10%=
 of the answers live, and find re-
listening to the recording at least two =
times is beneficial to catch 
everything.

However, we were at a lighthouse=
 that was supposed to be haunted, and 
a lady asked if there was a "Captain=
 Babcock" with us. About 8 
seconds later, the reply, "Spirit of Babcock" c=
ame through clearly. 
The file is in my folder here. So I do see value as w=
ell in asking 
questions. The downside is we have a tendency to talk over t=
hem 
sometimes, yet, it is nice to provide the earthbounds direction to 
he=
lp them speak what we need to hear (to help them). If people think 
they do=
 not need help, then they haven't been doing this enough in 
places where p=
eople in spirit are in trauma. Believe me, some of 
them truly are and are =
in need of help - period. 

Perhaps there are two ways to do this, dependin=
g on what one is 
trying to accomplish. At a haunted location, I seem to he=
ar 
enlightened spirits, as well as earthbounds coming through. This 
type =
of situation can be especially helpful to ask questions in my 
experience, =
as it helps to ferret out what's going on there and 
provide "evidence" of =
intelligent responses to the questions. This 
worked well to prove the spir=
it box as legit to the group who 
accompanied me.

When just trying to get =
"higher" messages from spirits, etc at home 
or elsewhere, I do think just =
letting it run and record is a great 
way to work with it, too. This way, t=
here are no expectations, just 
taking the time to listen for direction, me=
ssages of truth, hellos, 
etc. Sometimes this way will really surprise you,=
 especially when 
something comes through "off the cuff" and you are not ex=
pecting it. 

Frank, I hear your advice captain, but also want to throw in =
some of 
my personal experiences into the discussion.
