&gt; Hello all, I am new to the group and I have uploaded an EVP file I 
made 
&gt; with my new Digital Voice recorder in my bedroom this morning.  I 
had a 
&gt; really kick butt one that I sent to TAPs.  A little girl, clear as 
a 
&gt; bell but there was nothing I could do with it.  Hopefully TAPs can 
do 
&gt; something with it.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, the file I put up, if you listen REALLY close when I ask a 
&gt; question there are tiny bell sounds right after the question.  I 
have 
&gt; another almost 10 minute EVP where I left the recorder in the room, 
no 
&gt; windows or doors open and when I went in to turn it off there was a 
&gt; very strong scent of old fashioned tea rose.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone could bump up the 2nd one to see what the low voices are 
&gt; saying that would be great, drop me an e-mail.  I am a sensitive 
but 
&gt; would love to learn how to also use some equiptment to help me out.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you 
&gt;
