What is Platinum like or Iridium or the Iridium Platinum mix?  Just  
wondering.

Silver is the best conductor known, with a conductivity of 63.01 E06  
Siemens per meter. Copper is next best at 59.6 E06 S/m. Gold is not the best,  at 
45.2 E06 S/m. Aluminum is much farther down, at 37.8 E06 S/m.
 
Silver and gold are expensive. They are usually used to plate RF  
assemblies where the skin effect takes place (current doesn't flow  uniformly through 
a conductor at RF frequencies but mainly travels at the  surface of the 
conductor). Gold has the advantage that it never tarnishes  or corrodes with 
most things it is exposed to. It's used a lot in contacts for  rotary switches 
and relays.

my old man on a many job sinhce I was 8 and  never had seen anything like 
that. Copper is the only way to gold only  better conductor is Gold. but who 
can handle that in a house. worste  case of emf I have ever seen was a fancy 
chandaler that someone had  over sized bulbs in and that thing flared up 
the whole house to very  dangerous levels. when they say 60 watt max they mean 
it for your own  safety. this thing had around 10 100 watt bulbs in it and 
the emfs  were causing all kinds of nice images after 30 minutes in the 
house we  were having them too.

copper is a great conductor

I bought a transformer at Gateway Electronics in St.  Louis some years ago 
that looked like a great transformer for  a high-current 12 volt supply. The 
secondary appeared to be wound  with #8 enameled wire. I found out the 
secondary was wound with  aluminum wire. After I built the power supply and 
tried to  get 20 amps from it but couldn't, I gave up on it and got another  
transformer wound with copper wire.

 What if that house has aluminum wire?

Yes.  Also faulty wiring, which is  even more dangerous.
Also with flakey transformers  or other power distribution in the area, or 
power  lines.
Perhaps you can check with some neighbors,  and see how their power is 
doing.

Hi  All,
 
Is there someone  here that can answer and electrical question for  me?
 
During the case  that I recorded those possible EVP's-there was a  loud 
tapping noise that seemed to come from the 2nd  bedroom. Upon checking my logs, 
every time one  of  these clicks were heard, there would be an  EMF spike 
in the livingroom. The 2nd bedroom is  upstairs, the livingroom downstairs. 
The home owners  have also reported that they have a touch lamp that  comes 
on all the time by itself and the lights in  the Kitchen will dim 
occasionally.
 
Now these taps  are not consistent in timing, loudness or rhythm.  Could 
this be the work of faulty  breakers?
 
Thanks!
April
