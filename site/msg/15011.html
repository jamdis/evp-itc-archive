Yes, you are right. Sorry, I am just beginning to learn about this area of =
research. Everything omits radiation at different levels. 

What I should h=
ave said is that true EVP aren't produced via sound waves in the range of h=
uman hearing. But the fact that one recorder would pick up something and an=
other recorder just inches away would not does support the theory about it =
being transmitted right next to or directly on the electronics that write t=
o the media.

Sorry, my knowledge is very limited in this area so my terms =
may be incorrect or insufficient. Please correct me at will so I may learn =
all this properly.

April

        It sounds like she's saying =
"one, two, ....."

        A mistake that a lot of people make is thinking =
that there are two different types of energy at work when it comes to sound=
 waves and electromagnetic waves. The only thing that seperates them is fre=
quency and power. Radio waves are radio waves because they occupy a certain=
 block of the electromagnietic spectrum. Sound waves exist on that same spe=
ctrum just farther down with much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic wav=
es can penetrate almost anything because of their wavelengths. The shorter =
the wavelength the more ways we can shield against them.

        Think of =
microwaves. These are also a type of radio and telemetry transmitting wave =
but the waves also have a physical effect on our environment by causing mol=
ecules to speed up, which creates heat. A little lower than this is IR or i=
nfrared it too can cause physical objects to heat up but usually it just ca=
uses molecules to rotate in place. All physical things give off IR light. I=
ts a way the total system conserves energy by spontaneously emitting IR rad=

          Here is some food for thought.=
 I am currently reviewing my audio from our May 30th investigation.

      =
    It was me and another girl teammate present in the room. I picked up a =
3rd female voice on my digital voice recorder that I carry with me. We were=
 standing right next to another digital video recorder that I leave beside =
my night vision camera. That recorder did not pick up this 3rd voice. I hav=
e asked the girl that was with me to check her recording to see if she pick=
ed it up.

          I have long felt the true EVP does not come from sound=
 waves in the environment, or then it wouldn't be EVP, but a disembodied vo=
ice. Somehow EVP's are appearing directly on the recordings.

          Thi=
s instance with the recorders may back that theory up. That other recorder =
should have picked that voice up if it were sound waves in the environment.=


          I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. The file that is nam=
ed "01-02-17 Clip" is the full clip. You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah"=
, and then another comes in right after that. I think I know what it says.
=

          Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but still did not hear th=
is until playback. It isn't clear, so I am not as excited about it as my on=
e's from the last investigation.

                  I have a running theory that EVP is c=
arried on an untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to =
manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic =
waves that differ one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them=
 together you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if =
a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room=
 creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediat=
e difference frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20=
KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultr=
asonic signals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt that=
 EVP were generated within a few inches of the recorder.

                 =
 We are able to reproduce this affect in not only radio with superheterodyn=
e systems but also with acoustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a=
 commercial produce called the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.
