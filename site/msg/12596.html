<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree there is probably a mundane explanation for the face in this article, however, there 
is no chance of that with my technique, as I&#x27;m taking video directly into a pot of water.  
Others have been successful in replicating my simple set-up and have also gotten curious 
results.  One of my images was even confirmed by a forensic lab as being that of my GG-
grandfather.  Here is a link to my 3-min YouTube video:

It&#x27;s so easy.  I wish more people would try it!  :-)

&gt; I had a photo like that myself from an aquarium. Hate to burst  
&gt; bubbles, but it&#x27;s simply a reflection of a person on the glass who is  
&gt; close to the glass and looking up. Great effect though. :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; I saw this on the c2cfm web site and thought of Margaret.  If they  
&gt; &gt; knew your sucess with
&gt; &gt; water and video they would not be so surprised and mystified?  Nice  
&gt; &gt; clear face through.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; hope you can access the site here
