O well I would like to tell you that it really is true, and I know in my heart, because I was there.  Not\n&gt; sure why them cpu went off, but maybe I had too much infomation then they wanted me too.( I record write on to my laptop, and I don&#39;t use any type of digital or analog recorder).  I will prove it\n&gt; again.  Tonight I am going to do everything the same to see if I can get it to happen again.\n   \n&gt;   Rees\n\n&gt; reesclarke_69 &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;       Hey guys\n\n&gt; I had the most amazing session last night. Me and my fiance \n&gt; did a session, and this is how it went. \n\n&gt; We usally do 10 min. of audio, and during the session we first \n&gt; contacted a guy named Virgil, and we got him to say both of our \n&gt; names. He said &quot;William&quot; for me, and &quot;Leigh&quot; for Ashley. We all \n&gt; communicated for the 10 min. He didn&#39;t answer every question, but \n&gt; he answered 75% of all answerslast night. We told him that we \n&gt; wanted to prove that they exsisted on the other side. Life after \n&gt; death. He answer &quot;we are over here&quot;, very plainly. After the 10 \n&gt; min. We ask for confirmation so we could shut off the radio, and we \n&gt; got this answer &quot;that would be a bad idea&quot;. Which freaked Ashley \n&gt; out. So we kept the radio on and we had a conversation with this \n&gt; preacher, then while the band was still sweeping the preacher came \n&gt; through and he talked to us (while sweeping the band), and started \n&gt; to preach to us about our side, and how messed up it is.(the band \n&gt; was sweeping the whole time, I never stop the band from sweeping) \n&gt; He said that we needed to pray for our enemies as well as our \n&gt; friends and families. He talked to us for 6 to eight minutes. \n&gt; Then we finished the session (Ask for confirmation)when he didn&#39;t \n&gt; come through any more. We shut down. Then of course I get up and \n&gt; put everything back the way it is supposed to be. Leaving the \n&gt; session that we just did on the laptop. Then I went to take a \n&gt; shower, and I come back. The laptop was turned off and I lost all \n&gt; of the session. Sometimes the computer will log itself off, then \n&gt; when you get back it is exactly the was it was when you left it. \n&gt; But this wasn&#39;t the case, some reason the laptop shut itself off, \n&gt; and we lost all of the evidence that we had. Didn&#39;t have nothing, \n&gt; and I couldn&#39;t believe that we lost everything. So thats why I am \n&gt; sitting here typing away about what happen last night. Instead of \n&gt; me posting files about what happen last night. I wish so bad that \n&gt; y&#39;all would have been able to hear the communication. It was a life \n&gt; changing experience. It made me think a whole lot different about \n&gt; box research. I still can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t save it before the \n&gt; computer turned itself off. That is what happen to me last night, \n&gt; and change box research for me for the rest of my life.\n\n&gt; Thanks\n\n&gt; William Rees Clarke III"}
