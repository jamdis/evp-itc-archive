We will be sharing clips from box work at several of supposed\nhaunted locations and discussing why we think we get different levels there.\n\nAs always the chat will be open and calls are welcome. Here&#39;s how to party like\na rock star:\n\nhttp://www.stevehultay.com/rtsctalkradiogolive.html\n\nCall in number is 732-587-7041 \n\nCome over and get involved, heck it&#39;s Sunday night.
