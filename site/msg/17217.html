<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I set up this radio because it has a line input and wanted to connect the
Sony ArmBand radio to it, but-- It has shortwave so i turned that on the see
if anything was coming through, the shortwave bands were active. Sometimes I
use a method known as teh foreign language method where you tune in a
foreign language on shortwave that you don&#x27;t understand, and record directly
from the speaker, using the foreign language as the raw audio. In &#x27; &#x27;1854 at
10 seconds &quot;Big waves are comin&#x27; &quot;, I was tuned into a Chinese broadcast for
that one. Note the truncated word, my guys almost always use this form of
speech.

 In &#x27; &#x27; 1855 I used Spanish-- I think  and at the end something about
&quot;Peoples got sick I didn&#x27;t know that&quot;.

BTW, the Sony was nothing but noise when connected to this thing&#x27;s line
inputs.

 Ahhhhm they joy of putting up more skeptic fodder!
