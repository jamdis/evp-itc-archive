My name is Beth and I am new to this group! Thank you to the\n&gt; owners/moderators who approved my membership! I was looking for a group of\n&gt; paranormal investigators who enjoy talking about the paranormal as much as I\n&gt; do. My family and friends seem to be sick of me talking about it and\n&gt; whenever I mention something that I&#39;ve captured I get the roll of the eyes.\n&gt; Lol! \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve always been interested in ghost and ghost hunting. When I was little my\n&gt; mother would tell me that she would always hear boxes being thrown around in\n&gt; the basement and thought it to be a ghost. She also said that she would hear\n&gt; footsteps and feet being dragged across the long plastic runner that we had\n&gt; in front of the basement door. She would get up thinking it was one of us\n&gt; kids and we would be sound asleep. So, naturally my interest grew. I never\n&gt; seen anything unusual but I would always &#39;feel&#39; something in that house.\n&gt; When I got older, married, and had my own kids I lived in a questionable\n&gt; house for 11 years. We would hear footsteps in the attic, the kids would\n&gt; complain of seeing &#39;uncle Sam&#39; standing in the bathroom doorway, or a man\n&gt; walking through the bedroom. Of course I never believed them. I asked my son\n&gt; when he got older and he remembered the man in great detail. Turns out it\n&gt; was a man/spirit in period clothing with a long white beard and top hat.\n&gt; Hence the &#39;uncle Sam&#39; character. I have seen a female child apparition\n&gt; standing in the doorway to which I had a witness, my sister-in-law who saw\n&gt; the same thing at the same time. We thought it was one of our kids and\n&gt; quickly counted heads and it wasn&#39;t one of our own. The apparition vanished\n&gt; and we never saw it again. I have heard music playing in the basement and a\n&gt; man coughing when I&#39;ve been home alone. A roommate of mine had her shirt\n&gt; tugged on and she thought it was me but I wasn&#39;t home from work yet. She\n&gt; locked herself in her room, scared to death until I came home. The stories\n&gt; go on and on. \n&gt; \n&gt; I moved from that home and now I am having strange things occur in this\n&gt; house. I should note that I am over a thousand miles from my previous \n&gt; haunted&#39; home. I&#39;ve lived here 4 yrs and one day I seen a little ball of\n&gt; light (ORB) shoot out of my bedroom and go into my husband&#39;s chair. I have\n&gt; seen a few shadows and have felt that creepy feeling where my hair stands on\n&gt; end many times. So, I decided to get a digital recorder. Not thinking that I\n&gt; would ever capture anything. I also wanted to use it to debunk EVPs and find\n&gt; some Scientific explanation for them. I was wrong. I captured my first EVP\n&gt; in the master bedroom of my home. It said, &quot;I have no love&quot;. Ok, that got my\n&gt; attention. I tried to debunk it and could not. I decided to perform many EVP\n&gt; sessions in my bedroom and have caught a lot of them. I have asked questions\n&gt; and ask to knock for yes to certain questions. By doing so I figured out\n&gt; that it was a Hispanic woman who had been murdered. After some research I\n&gt; have since found out that yes someone had died in this house. One of the\n&gt; previous tenants claimed there was a ghost here and even went so far as to\n&gt; get the house cleansed. I must have brought it back by summoning it while\n&gt; conducting my EVP sessions. \n&gt; \n&gt; My fascination grew now that I was actually capturing real evidence. I have\n&gt; since went on tours of supposedly haunted places such as: Vulture Mine,\n&gt; Arizona, The Bird Cage Theatre Tombstone, Arizona, the San Carlos Hotel,\n&gt; Phoenix, and Goldfield Ghost Town, Arizona. I am new at this so I haven&#39;t\n&gt; been on any investigations on a team. I do it alone. The only equipment that\n&gt; I&#39;ve been using is a digital camera and recorder. My main interest is\n&gt; capturing something paranormal on film or EVPs. \n&gt; \n&gt; I have recently made a couple of trips to a local cemetery, during the day,\n&gt; middle of the afternoon and have caught amazing EVPs. I have captured many\n&gt; different voices and personalities. Some nice, some not so nice. Some women,\n&gt; men, and children. It amazes me because I cannot debunk them. I know for a\n&gt; fact that I&#39;m the only one there so they can&#39;t be explained. I know it wasn\n&gt; t me who I was hearing, so who is it? I&#39;m not sure if ghosts really exist or\n&gt; if they are all residual energy. Since capturing the voices actually\n&gt; answering my questions I am leaning toward that they really exist. There&#39;s\n&gt; just no denying. I now believe that some are residual and some are\n&gt; intelligent spirits. I enjoy EVPs because they are much harder to debunk.\n&gt; With photographs there is always that &#39;what if&#39; or well it could be a glare\n&gt; or a glitch in the camera. But with EVPs they are unmistakable. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m looking forward with getting to know everyone and sharing my experiences\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Beth\n&gt;"}
