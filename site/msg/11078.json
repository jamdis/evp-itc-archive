I suggest you try working at home, \npatiently, and with a verity of methods. Usually you need somekind of \nbackground sound that &quot;they&quot; can use to form voices, in the past that \nwas white noise, and that will still work, but now various swept \nradios are being used for louder, and clearer messages. \n\n I have tried for years to get people out of that crazy ghost hunter \nmentality--to no avail! \n\n Frank-S\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ghostmom65&quot; &lt;ranjan65@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have been to lots of haunted places like Gettysburg, Eastern \nState \n&gt; Penitentiary, and many other documented haunted places and have not \n&gt; captured any evp&#39;s at all. Just wondering if it is just me or am I \n&gt; doing it all wrong? I bring a voice recorder that uses a standard \n&gt; recording tape and can&#39;t hear anything unusual. Any suggestions on \nhow \n&gt; I can try to get some voices would be great. I am open-minded to \nthe \n&gt; spirit world and have seen spirits but not heard from them. Would \nlike \n&gt; to try to capture some voices. Any suggestions would be great!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks very much,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jan\n&gt;"}
