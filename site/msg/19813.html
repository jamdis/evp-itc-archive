<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m interested in EVP/ITC/Spiricom so that I can get audio recordings
proving that Spirit exists, that each natural-born man or woman of the  Spirit IS a differentiated spirit (either with, or without a physical body) and that after physical death the spirit body continues on, especially if the physical body was subjected to death before its time.

In particular I met, and fell in love with on first meeting (and only physical meeting) a woman in 2000 whose physical body died as a result of traumas caused by landing on rocks from 40 feet above;
it appears likely that she was murdered instead of the public story which was that it was &quot;an accidental fall from a height&quot; with &quot;no foul play&quot; involved. In 2008, she returned to find me and did find me. I saw her in spirit walking up and down the main road near where her physical body had gone off the cliff. I thought it was maybe just my imagination 
but then some months later she showed up in my house, laying on my bed. I could see her there in full (yet fully transparent) colour, moving slightly. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes but having been very spiritually sensitive and open all my life, it was almost .. almost second nature and I just about jumped on her on the bed to give her a big hug. It may sound crazy but we stayed together the whole day and talked psychically about everything under the sun, moon and stars, then fell asleep in each other&#x27;s &#x27;arms&#x27; at the end of the day; I woke up at 6:01 the next morning to find out she was still there! I was then reminded of the whole experience, and burst out with total emotion and asked her with total sincerity to marry me ... and she accepted saying &quot;Yes!!!&quot; ... (I quickly noted down the exact date and time so I could always know and remember our anniversary, which we&#x27;ve now celebrated every year since then). 

Now after almost 3 years of being together, she and I are VERY restless about making her communication (and our communication) much more tangible. She&#x27;s very capable of doing EVP etc. (possibly with a little coaching on how to do it from me, if I can learn enough about how it works myself), based on what she&#x27;s told me, and the fact she&#x27;s shown many manifestations of being really here and alive ... it&#x27;s just hard to convince others of this without tangible evidence.

So that is in essence what brought me to the EVP-ITC forum. 
Thanks for having me here!
