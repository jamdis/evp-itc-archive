I was wrong. Doo=\r\nr to the Dead has exceeded my worst expectations.\n\n  Generally, I respect J=\r\nohn Oliver&#39;s work as a medium. While I have no personal experience with him=\r\n, in the past he has looked and acted more genuine than not, the rolling of=\r\n the eyes put aside for the moment.\n\n  I do take exception to the character=\r\nization of the talking box as an Edison device. I have documented the histo=\r\nry of Edison, ITC and EVP  elsewhere. This is however the smallest concern =\r\nI have with this show.\n\n  Prior to wathcing I had just had a conversation w=\r\nith a respected colleague on the West coast regarding interesting phenomena=\r\n he and others are constantly observing in sites with phenomena similar to =\r\nthat on Door to the Dead. None of those measurements were made by this team=\r\n. The use of thermal in this situation is not indicated as well.\n\n  The rea=\r\nl concern is that no attempt was made to help this family in a broader cont=\r\next. The skeptic did and said nothing skeptical as far as I could tell. Key=\r\n questions were not asked (at least on-camera) that would reveal the psycho=\r\n-dynamics of this family. We know fairly well at this time that PK phenomen=\r\na is often centered on a focal person who can exhibit specific characterist=\r\nics. That the team seems unaware of this is quite disturbing to a person li=\r\nke myself.\n\n  A real research opportunity was lost in this case, as was an =\r\nopportunity to educate the public on the right way to approach such situati=\r\nons. Continually sending the messages that phenomena is based on &#39;demons&#39; a=\r\nnd &#39;spirits&#39; exclusively does nothing to further the position of serious in=\r\nvestigators, which is perhaps most troubling of all.\n\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_016B_01C98EA0.C14BC650\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.=\r\nw3c.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-eq=\r\nuiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META conte=\r\nnt=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6001.18183&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY style=3D&quot;BACKG=\r\nROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;Comic S=\r\nans MS&quot;&gt;I find most paranormal shows&nbsp;have \nbecome BS and I don&#39;t watch=\r\n any.
