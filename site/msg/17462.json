I have come to the realization that skeptics cannot be avoided and my audio needs to get out there for feedback.\n\nFor those who don&#39;t know me, my name is Tim Woolworth.  I have been (sigh) a ghost hunter for years.  I discovered ITC a couple of years ago  and I was relegated to using a Shack Hack until 6 or 7 months ago.  At that time, a Minibox Plus found its way to me and my view of ITC and the afterlife has changed entirely.  Since I have been practicing ITC, ghost hunting just isn&#39;t that much fun anymore.\n\nI now do sessions about three times a week.  I have been keeping my audio clips to myself until now.  I have posted clips on other boards and I almost never get replies.  One thing I have noticed about this group is that everyone is good at listening to clips and responding so I decided to start posting only at this forum instead of the others.  \n\nI have started a folder today.  The clips put in there are from last night.  I recorded a ten minute session after writing the reply to the skeptic last night.  These are five short clips, and a transcript, from that session which had activity the entire time.  The clips include konstantin Raudive, the Others talking about using the Ghost Boxes, a warning for me, and my new favorite clip: a rapper comes through at the end to say good-bye.\n\nThank you for listening.\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Tim%20Woolworth/June%202010/\n\nTim W."}
