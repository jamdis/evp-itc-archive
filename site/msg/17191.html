Subject: [EVP-ITC] Some  offended.



 
I get reque=
sts for boxes, and I think some get offended that I  don't just 
whip out a=
 box and throw it at them for "their research". Trouble  is, 
there's too m=
any whack jobs out there wanting to be the  world's onlyest box 
expert, or=
 the ones desperately grieving, or  lately, religious nuts! 
 
 I've said i=
t over and over and over and over and over and  
over--expectation will cre=
ate the voices you want to hear. If you are  seeking Jesus, that 
is exactl=
y what you are going to get and you'll swear  it's God gospel 
freaking tru=
th, and the rest of us should bow down to you. I  think y'all know 
who I'm=
 talking about. 
 
 I am uncertain if one can ask for certain spirits, or i=
f even  that tends 
to create what one wans. I think maybe it works the sam=
e as the  above. I 
don't ask for any specific spirits/entities, I don't as=
k questions,  I just 
let them talk and try not to influance it. If I have =
question, I  might think 
it, and most of the time they'll answer, wiht out=
 me  asking.  That could be 
just creating want I want to hear as well--don=
't  know.
 
 I don't have to be on these groups and I don't have make   box=
es, except 
for my own use. I think the messages are personal in  nature, n=
o one is going 
to hear it the same, and it's about worthless as  "evidence=
". We get enough 
that's shareable to show others that it's real,  and I th=
ink that is about 
the best that can be hoped for. I think, and it is  only=
 my opinion, that 
"evidence" at so called haunted areas is just what is  e=
xpected, I really 
don't think it proves anything.
 
 Then, there the bulli=
es that want all this to conform to their  wishes, 
and we saw more example=
s of that with the recent e-bay auction,  and y'all 
know who you are! If n=
o one sells boxes, no one builds boxes, its'  that 
simple! Parts and radio=
s are not free, and why the hell should we be  expected to 
spend endless h=
ours on this stuff for nothing!?
 
 I know, I know --sacrilege!I know, I kn=
