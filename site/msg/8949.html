  This guy who sells on Ebay does get 55.00 a unit for them.  He is out f New York.  He originally wanted 129.00 for it.  I was considering posted a 12-469 for 24.95 plus shipping and I will modify it for free or if anyone wanted too I was going to post the instructions to modify one on the same add just to screw with this guy.  What do you thing?

On ebay.de I saw one for €25 (about €40), what is still expensive for
such an old and low-quality device.

You could also try a schottky diode which is more sensitive than a
german diode. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schottky_diode
