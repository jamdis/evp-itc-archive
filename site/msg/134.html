I agree.  I'm not one to go cemetaries.  And I did tell my contacts what I =
would be doing.  I get images of it being almost like an amusement park for=
 them.  Where they can go to have some fun with the physical. 

But the ene=
rgy here was amazing! It didn't feel bad at all. The only part of the cemet=
ary that gave me bad vibes was this old tree in the back. My husband said t=
hat by the way it looks it could have been a hanging tree.  They hung the c=
riminals there and buried them in the woods.  So that was more of a psychic=
 imprint from the past.

  HI Frank,
  =
I don't think they do naturally hang around graveyards.  I think they are t=
here when we record or just let them know of our presence.  I know that Bra=
den and friends come to talk just about wherever we are, and that includes =
the graveyard.  Bayview Cemetery is considered one of the most haunted in W=
ashington state and is just down the road from me and Mary Jo.  Once we wen=
t into the mausoleum there, where it was pretty darn scary.  Neither of us =
got an EVP or an anomalous photo there, despite the strange vibes.  Vicki
