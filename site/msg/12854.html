(Misty... you may remove =
this post if it is against the forum rules)

Greetings fellow researchers,
=

I normally don't get into petty matters such as the following, but an 
ind=
ividual (Bruce Halliday) who was banned from this forum is asking 
me to st=
op my claim of being the originator of the hack of the 12-470.
He wants me =
to remove that claim from my website, etc.
Bruce's e-mail to me was one of =
surprise.
Why... it was on this very forum that Bruce admitted that his 
at=
tempted hack of the 12-470 did not work, after I had shared my 
success wit=
h all of you.
I've included the forum messages from last year with their da=
te and 
time stamps. The messages are still right here on this forum.
Bruce=
 says he hacked the radio first and then posted his hack on his 
website.
B=
ut, as you can see in the following messages, Bruce told me his 
attempt di=
d not work, posting this after my hack.

I would not even mention this if B=
ruce's e-mail to me wasn't so 
threatening. .. I just wanted to get the rec=
ord straight.

Okay... I spent the money :-) and yes, it (the 12-470) can be
m=
odified to sweep the AM, FM, TV, and Wx bands. I just completed the
mod on =
the 12-470. Unlike the 12-469, the 12-470 has a built in
speaker too!
I'll =
post a video of me doing both the 12-469 mod and the 12-470 mod.

Thanks..
