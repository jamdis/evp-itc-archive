<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Everyone!

I&#x27;m new and I stumbled onto this group after doing some research
online into EVP.  I consider myself to be a paranormal skeptic, but I
have heard some very interesting EVP evidence and would like to look
into it further.  I joined this group because I am interested in
submitting EVP data to some rigorous scientific analysis.  I&#x27;m an
electrical engineer and mainly work in the areas of signal processing
and communications so all of this is extremely interesting.  

I am interested in collecting some of my own data (at some point) by
building a ghost box based on Frank Sumption&#x27;s designs.  I am working
from the &quot;Ghost Box Notebook&quot; from 2007, but I am having a hard time
getting started.  Has anyone built one of these and are there any
parts lists or more complete schematics floating around? I would
appreciate any build help or advice any of you might have.

Regards,

Anna</pre>
