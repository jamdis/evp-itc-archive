Yep ever since Frank Sumption and Retro Dave mentioned trying it and I did,=

I hope you'll give m=
anual sweep a try. As I've mentioned in other posts, I have a number of the=
 automated sweep devices, and the manual sweep results can give any of them=
 a run for their money. You can try just about any radio that has a tight e=
nough dial to rapidly move back and forth across the band. 

There is also =
one known unit out there (probably more yet undiscovered) that all you have=
 to do is hold down the tuner button (and keep holding) and it sweeps autom=
atically without being hacked. See if you can pick up a Sony #SRF-M37V. I k=
now other researchers who've gotten good results with that. Just add batter=
ies and you're good to go. Oh, and an external speaker too.
