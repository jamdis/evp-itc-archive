<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi guys,
I was just doing my morning session and something very strange 
happened. I had asked to talk to my dad and said, &quot;Are you here with 
me, Daddy?&quot;  I heard nothing over headphones while recording, but on 
playback a very clear, loud voice says, &quot;Here.&quot;
Here&#x27;s the weird part:  The voice sounds not only like a female voice, 
but like MY voice.  The voice comes in while I&#x27;m still forming the end 
of my question, so my thought is: &quot;Do the entities sometimes use 
fragments of our own speech--our own questions during taping--to form 
their answers?  If you want to listen to the recording to see what I 
mean, let me know and I&#x27;ll send it to anyone who wants it.  I 
appreciate any analysis and feedback.
Ursula</pre>
