It \nworked better than I thought it would.\nIt&#39;s not a microphone but it picks up energy in the area and produces \nwaveforms.\nI&#39;ve produced a short video showing a demonstration of what it \ncaptured in two modes.  You can see that video, here:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqRI0F59uDk\n\nThanks,\n- Mike (UFO Geek)\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; My prototype design of an EVP capture device using diodes, coils,\n&gt; resistors. This allows for the capture of EVP without a microphone.\n&gt; Plugs into a tape recorder, digital recorder, or computer. Similar \nto\n&gt; the Raudive diode device used in the 1970&#39;s.\n&gt; If you&#39;d like, you can see it here:\n&gt; http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/2008/11/mikes-diode-evp-capture-\ndevice.h&#92;\n&gt; tml\n&gt; &lt;http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/2008/11/mikes-diode-evp-capture-\ndevice.&#92;\n&gt; html&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Now... on with a few tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike (UFO Geek)\n&gt;"}
