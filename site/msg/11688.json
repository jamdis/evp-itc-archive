I&#39;ve \nbeen using the built-in flash on my D70S but think it&#39;s about time to get \none of the Nikon speedlights to go with it.\n\nZack\n\nOn Mon, 11 Aug 2008, Elizabeth wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Mon, 11 Aug 2008, Chad wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey Guys,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Any of you still use a 35mm to take pictures with? I have 2 of them\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and tried over the weekend to utilize them in an investigation. The\n&gt;&gt;&gt; exposure time on these things is like 30 seconds. It&#39;s such a pain in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the butt. If you do use the 35mm, what kind of settings do you use?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Any advice? I am totally new to night photography. Has everyone gone\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to digital now or what?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Chad\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I use a digital SLR (Cannon Digital Rebel xti) with a big flash\n&gt; mounted on it either directed up at the ceiling or with a diffuser\n&gt; attached to avoid dust orbs. Occasionally I also will set it for a\n&gt; long exposure to capture some cool architecture or something, but I\n&gt; won&#39;t use any of those photos as evidence just because there are so\n&gt; many normal things that can happen during a long exposure to make\n&gt; something odd show up in the pic.\n&gt; In most situations with the right lens (I love my Canon 50mm f1.8) you\n&gt; can adjust the iso and f-stop to take a good picture in low light with\n&gt; a fast shutter speed without needing the flash. If you don&#39;t\n&gt; understand how all the settings (f-stop, iso speed, shutter speed)\n&gt; work together I&#39;d suggest getting yourself a basic photography book or\n&gt; taking a class at your local camera shop. You&#39;d be amazed how many\n&gt; &quot;ghost pictures&quot; will start just looking like camera operator error to\n&gt; you after a while. haha\n&gt;\n&gt; ~Elabeth\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
