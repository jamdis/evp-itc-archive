Hi Elabeth,
 
You have to remember much of what the Ovilus 1 said probably ended up on  the 
editing room floor.  But it does work.  I get great responses from  mine.  
The (7) different modes on it work very well.  But if you know  anyone who wants 
one please let me know.  I was informed I have to  sell some of my toys to 
afford to buy new toys...LOLOL  I would sell it for  $165.00 and it is in brand 
new condition and only used a few times.
 
Jeff

I thought it was pretty neat that it repeated the word "worry" when
Ryan  asked if it was worried they'd bring in a priest.
What are the odds of that  just based on environmental readings? If I
had an extra $200 laying around  I'd be buying myself one to play with.
