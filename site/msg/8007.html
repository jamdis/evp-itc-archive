<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree with some of what Bruce said. But dont go throwing out 
everything you have learned about ITC research it STILL applies no 
matter what method you are using you are building a bridge of 
contact. I get alot of the same voices coming thru no matter what 
method I use. There are many ways they can manipulate sound whether 
its using evpmaker, the boxes, water, laser, spiricom, etc.

As for it being the only live method that is not quite true either 
some of the other methods allow you to hear some of the feedback you 
get live too (if you can hear them).

The basic rule of thumb is to remember there are no experts. Try it 
and see what works best for you and your own hearing.

&gt; mike,
&gt;  
&gt; I&#x27;m sorry I was not around when you started, I guess no one took 
the time to explain boxes and box research to you.
&gt; Well here is a crash course!
&gt;  
&gt; I don&#x27;t know what your experience is with evp_itc or any other form 
of spirit communication, but whatever you have learned about 
capturing and analyzing traditional EVP, has to be thrown right out 
the window. 
&gt; Box research is a horse of a whole different color. The basic 
premise for traditional evp capture is that the spirit or entity that 
is grounded or in visitation at a set location, will manipulate the 
ambient energy available to it that surrounds the recording medium, 
be it a digital or analog recorder. It uses this energy, usually 
thought to be EMF energy to place an asimally of a voice onto the 
recorder. The recording is then uploaded to a computer and is gone 
over by the researcher/investigator to search for these little 
whispered voices on the recording. This traditional way of gathering 
spirit communication serves it&#x27;s purpose or at least has served it&#x27;s 
purpose. 
&gt;  
&gt; When you decided to pick up a box, everything you ever learned 
about spirit communication ceased to apply.  Box communication in a 
nutshell, no matter what type of box you use is run on the same 
premise. The box or radio is made to sweep the dial fast enough so 
that no stable or whole radio signal is captured. The signal is 
therefore fragmented into small bits of sound and fragments of human 
speech. The idea is for our spirit friends to be able to manipulate 
the fragments of sound to form intelligible words, phrases and 
messages that we can understand clearly.
&gt;  
&gt; As you know the major factor in the difference between box research 
and traditional EVP is the fact that you can and most certainly do 
hear spirit communication through a box live and in real time.
&gt; That&#x27;s what sets this apart from any other paranormal communication 
research in the world or even the history of paranormal research.
&gt;  
&gt; The research you are embarking on now will take time and patience 
to become accustomed too but eventually with experience comes 
stronger communication, a better relationship between you and your 
spirit tech/guides and a better ear for hearing and discerning spirit 
communication from ordinary radio noise.
&gt;  
&gt; this is just a quick explanation but don&#x27;t worry anyone here that 
knows me can tell you there will be much more to come.
&gt;  
&gt; The reason I started this reply was your reference to class a EVP, 
in box research there is no such thing, you either hear it or you 
don&#x27;t.
&gt;  
&gt; Mike my ears and my mouth are always open so any questions, don&#x27;t 
hesitate.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Bruce, yeah I am new to the group. 4 weeks now.  I have other 
files loaded, and only load what is closer to class &quot;A&quot;  EVP.  
&gt;  
&gt; I am using the radio shack hack 12-469.
&gt;  
&gt; I record usually in the morning. I work from home, and wait until 
the kids and wife are out of the house, so I have no interruptions.
&gt;  
&gt; My personal interest is to make contact with my family members and 
friends that have passed on. I have so many questions to ask them, 
etc....
&gt;  
&gt; Tips are welcome.. I still am playing with the sound of the radio 
when in scan mode. Trying to get the volume just right where if i did 
hear a spirit, the sound of the radio does not drown it out.
&gt;  
&gt; Any advice you can give me after listening to my files, that would 
be great!

&gt; Hi Mike, I have just returned to this group after a short 
absence.My name is Bruce I have exstensive experience with box 
research and do my own research with every type of box that is 
available including the newest Frank&#x27;s box that is out.I hear a 
female response saying &quot;YES&quot; at the very end of the file. What box 
are you using? if you can Mike keep your questions as short and to 
the point as possible, the longer your speaking the more chance of 
stepping on a message or answer.Plus the shorter and more direct the 
question the easier it will be for them to answer in a reasonable 
ammount of time. If you don&#x27;t mind me asking, how long are you 
involved in box research? I do not remember you the last time I 
participated here. If you have any questions or I can help you with 
anything just let me know. Bruce
