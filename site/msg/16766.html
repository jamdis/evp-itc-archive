<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hmmmmm, I hope this is going to be a common way to upload files when the &quot;ghost boxes&quot; are used....I mentioned this months ago-we need to upload ALL the &quot;BOX&quot; audio files in -slow motion audio- to help HEAR what is said. THANK YOU!! I can actually UNDERSTAND a ghost box now!! Hahaha :)

&gt;  Years ago there was a couple doing EVP research in Europe, and they claimed
&gt; the higher spirits connected their equipment to ours. In EVPmaker they used
&gt; to talk about the cable connection. I&#x27;m wondering if since I don&#x27;t use one
&gt; box, or the computer consistently, I either don&#x27;t have that connection, or I
&gt; get something/someone else connected, so I get crapola voices and
&gt; predictions. The couple are the ones Macy used to work with, something like
&gt; Harsh and Fischback--probably obliterating the names though. What if others
&gt; sporadic, or lying EVPs come from this lack of/or broken connection? So far
&gt; these lower voices are not worth the trouble, and any information is
&gt; useless.
&gt; 
&gt;  I think I&#x27;ll try having a box that is always left in the same spot.
