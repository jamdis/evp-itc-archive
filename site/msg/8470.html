For me it was the 12-469, It has worked well with me.  I did buy a 20-125, and hacked it correctly, and I didn't like it.  I also didn't get very much reception.  The 20-125 has a long anntena, and the 12-469 you can hold it in your hand, and you act as the anntena.  That way you get better reception.  Only problem with the 12-469 is that it clicks a little, but I can't hear it anymore.  I train not to hear it.

  Thanks
