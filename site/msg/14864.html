Arrogant!? Sumption? You have a warped view of Sumption if you see arroganc=
e. He is in your face and speaks his mind but he has never claimed to be an=
ything other than "the box" creator. Does he talk shit about people who cla=
im to be experts? Hell yeah! That's one of the reason we like him.

Hi All
=A0
I have to admit that I share the same opi=

 the UK using old reel to reel methods and obtaining excellent results. I l=

ed on me...what is life all about. I went on to research every evp pioneer =
i could, listen to hours/days of recordings and it changed my outlook on li=
fe. tears were turned to smiles and then I realised what all this research =
is for. it was a big step for me spiritually. 
=A0
I dont know if there is =
anyone else on here using old fashioned methods but if anybody would like t=
o hear recordings please ask. I am using a reel to reel sony "Hi frequency"=
 recorder and trying various types of tones, backgrounds e.t.c.
=A0
Good lu=
ck to everyone with their research, you are right we are changing history w=
e are discovering new things. if it wasnt for individuals such as raudive, =
jurghenson to name a few, maybe we wouldnt have discovered this. it takes a=
 brave individual to tackle an arrogant human race blunted with science.

guys,

Sorry to burden you with this nonsense but =
this group and the RTSC group are my only venues to respond to posts on oth=
er groups and have my account heard, I hope you do not mind to much.

Here =
is a copy of my final personal e-mail to Frank Sumption which by the way is=
 meant for him but he see's fit to post them publicly in an attempt to disc=
redit me.

I want you to read it first hand so there are no chance of it be=
ing altered before it is posted else where.

I will not address Frank again=

------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -

Frank,

=
This is getting ridiculous now, you should stop writing these posts, all yo=
u are doing is making yourself look ridiculous.

I have offered many times =
to make my raw recordings available for review by anyone who wants them. I =
have made the same challenge to your friend moon who we all know is behind =
this tirade he has time and again refused or ignored the request for any ty=
pe of audio file
to be publicly posted for revue and continues to take adva=
ntage of innocent unsuspecting people with his con game and charging large =
amounts of money for sessions where he fabricates and makes up content as h=
e goes along.

I was the only one to confront him in public and expose him =
for the fake he is and this is his feeble attempt at retaliation. I and oth=
er researchers like me have brought this research light years from where it=
 was when you and I first met, moon just continues to use it to rip people =
off and has not contributed a thing to the research of ghost box communicat=
ion beside lining his own pockets. 

Just the fact that he has you doing hi=
s dirty work shows the type of guy he is. I can remember a time when you pu=
blicly came out against any type of money making using your boxes and even =
refused moon when he wanted to manufacture and sell them for large profits =
yet now you condone his robbery of innocent unaware people and actually act=
 foolish on his behest.

Frank you are better than this, just concentrate o=
n developing a better box and forget about moon and his tricks and lies, he=
 is finished in the paranormal and he knows it, everyone is wise to his gam=
e and he is practically an outcast.

Frank you are hitching you wagon to a =
dead horse. Get away from these bad influences before they ruin your reputa=
tion as well.

We have had this moon discussion in the past and once he has=
 exhausted his need for you he will screw you again like he has done so man=
y times before.

Frank, I like and respect you and I hope you will consider=
 what I have said in this e-mail and I sincerely hope you post this one on =
the evp-itc group. I will be posting it on my group and others I belong to.=


Your former friend
Bruce
