          Misty,
 
No problem I'll make a main folder now.
 
What I try to do is leave the files posted for a week and then delete the old and replace them with new.

        Cool will try and check those out. Hey Bruce can ya please make yourself one folder there in the main directory and call it Bruce's files or Bruce Halliday's EVP, trying to keep that section organized so its easier to find peoples stuff. You can make as many subfolders in your folder as you like, one for each box type if you like.
   
  Gonna do some cleaning on there soon and get rid of some of the ones that are no longer posting here or unjoined. Dont want to do that but we need the space. Im thinking of other alternatives for us to have more space tho in the future =)

      Hey boy's and girls,

Here are some new Frank's box files. You may find the ones about sweep 
rate interesting.

There are quite a few good ones, New researchers please take note of 
the different sound between Frank's box and the RS boxes. The operation 
of the box and the sound and files it produces are very unique to each 
FB.
