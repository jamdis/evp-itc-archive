Oh yeah-sure....if it is for someone else, no harm in delivering it. Then b=

    Yep =
thats pretty much how it goes unless they press me to share it with who the=
 message is for and even then the timing has to be right. May be then, may =
be a year later but the messages always get thru to who they are meant to.

          As far as I am concer=
ned, for what it is worth-you seem to be going about it the right way. As l=
ong as you remain open mindedly skeptical about any knew info, just as you =
did with the messages that were for you, there is no problem with it at all=

          It sounds like you don't discount it and you don't buy in=

                  There is no doubt in my mind =
about that. You are right April =3D) In the beginning I did seek some proof=
 for my own sanity. But time and time again I have learned much more than I=
 ever expected to. For me its become more than about contact with my dead l=
oved ones, its more about learning and growing from the experiences. That d=

                    I would definitely call that proof. The strength o=
f the proof is in the part that you knew nothing about what the message wou=

u had not known prior.

                    IMO, in this case there is no w=

ear, that it was real information conveyed through an intelligent source.

                    mothers voice and no boxes were involved. The box is a =

                      tool/method and there are many ways to get their voi=

                      heard. So in the different methods I have used, =
yes I have 
                      heard voices that resemble their lifetime=
 charachteristics 
                      and tones. Is it always that way? =
No. <BR>> <BR>> 
                      Most often the group will spea=
k as one voice because I 
                      have requested they do so. =
One voice tone will begin a 
                      sentence and another wil=
l end it. So I may hear my female 
                      friends voice star=
t off a thought and an unknown male 
                      voice finish the=
 sentence. And vice versa often they speak

which do not even come close to what they sounded 
                      li=
ke in life. Quite often they are spirits I didnt know in 
                 =
     life. I may get someone saying This is edison, and then 
             =
         find an old recording he did where he starts it off saying 
      =
                This is edison, but for me I do not know the man so there

                      is no recognition for me. I document it and file it a=
