After processing the sound through EVP Maker I then recorded the session by playing the sound though my computer and amplified speakers and recording with a small unidirectional mic and a small handheld digital recorder.  \n   \n  Sorry but I tried to cut out my questions and ramblings on the recording but it didn&#39;t happen.  I don&#39;t think I got anything on the recording but the EVP Maker noise.  Maybe someone with a trained ear can listen in a bit.  I am open to any suggestions on how to improve what I am doing.  Maybe it is better to bag it all until I fix the RS 690 that I trashed a few days ago.  ron l  \n\n       \n---------------------------------\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?
