&gt;  I think you can move it forward by standing on someone else&#x27;s head. 
&gt; Yet another self proclaimed expert using my stuff, and other&#x27;s stuff 
&gt; for his advancement, and agandizement. Same old story over and over. 
&gt; 
&gt;  Bruce has only had a box since last fall, and just joined this group 
&gt; last year, by his own admission doen&#x27;t know how the technology works, 
&gt; but will tell everyone he&#x27;s the world onlyest expert! With years 
&gt; experience, while many here, to me, seem to seek the spotlight along 
&gt; with him.  
&gt; 
&gt;  I have a site to share information on what I&#x27;m doing, that way these 
&gt; clowns can continue to claim it as their own.
