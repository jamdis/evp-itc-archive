<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>There is NO research anywhere which shows that germanium diodes are 
superior to silicon diodes as far as the &quot;diode method&quot; is concerned.

Konstantin Raudive didn&#x27;t pioneer the &quot;diode method&quot; (sorry - exactly 
who did escapes me for the moment). I have a copy of &quot;Breakthrough&quot; 
which is the only English translation of any of Raudive&#x27;s books and 
the &quot;diode method&quot; is described in an appendix. The diagram in the 
appendix note shown there (and I can scan in the page in the book and 
post here, if anyone likes) shows a typical 1N914 diode which uses 
silicon as the base semiconductor.

The only &quot;transcommunication device&quot; I&#x27;m aware of that specifically 
called out for the use of germanium was the one diagrammed by the 
spirits in one of the Scole Experiments (and even then - it was a 
block of this material - not a component diode).

By the way - it was &quot;Konstantin Raudive&quot; (with a &quot;k&quot;), &quot;Franz Seidl&quot; 
(not Seidle...See Jean de Muelder&#x27;s website for original diagrams of 
the Psychofon from Seidl&#x27;s book 
http://jeandemeulder.transcommunicatie.nl/psychophone2.htm) 
and &quot;George Meek&quot; (no &quot;s&quot;). Additionally - George Meek&#x27;s Metascience 
Foundation developed at least 5 different models of the Spiricom 
(most people are only familiar with Bill O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s Mark IV).

&gt; Sure RetroCom,
&gt; 
&gt; According to WORLDITC there are many different devices using 
different
&gt; aspects of the radio and white-noise spectrum. Constantine Raudive
&gt; used germanium diodes to capture EVPs. Siedle built his psychophone,
&gt; George Meeks had the Spiricom tone device. Now you have the diode 
for
&gt; white noise, radio wave HF static, and a tone device. I am 
attempting
&gt; to build an all in one audio recording and communication device. I 
am
&gt; doing this to see if by having a combined unit you can get contact
&gt; with either one or the other or perhaps multiple contacts at one 
time.

&gt; &gt; Can you define with some detail &quot;all ways&quot; ?

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is my first post. I was wondering if anyone had created an 
all in
&gt; &gt; one ITC EVP device. I know that researchers such as Seidle had 
created
&gt; &gt; the psychophone that seemed to cover many aspects of ITC but I 
have
&gt; &gt; yet to see all ways of communication in one device.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have created an all in one design that covers most of the 
devices
&gt; &gt; used. If you wish I will share the design.
