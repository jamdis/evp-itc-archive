The great thing about statistical hypothesis testing is that you can have a=
n opinion or even a biased and it doesn't matter because the data will tell=
 the tale. If your going to do this study correctly then you need to setup =
you study correctly. What is your hypothesis? You need at least two indepen=
dent variables to make the test viable. Is this going to parametric or non-=
parametric (are there certain assumptions being made and adhered to)? How a=
re you going to test the data (ANOVA, Z-test, t-test, etc)? What is your sa=
mple size going to be like? How will you set up a control? Is the compariso=
n distribution going to resemble the classic bell curve?
=C2=A0
My point in=
 writing all this is to demonstrate that there is a lot more information an=
d "procedure" that goes into testing samples and setting up a study to be t=
ruly objective. The tests are designed to be objective because people by na=
ture are not capable of objectivity. That is why I say you can have a biase=
d and it doesn't matter, the data will tell the tale. If your going to pres=
ent evidence or do a half-assed survey to convince yourself or others, don'=
t! You are doinbg yourself and the people you are trying to convince a diss=
ervice and that is misleading.
=C2=A0
As you said, the fact that they didn'=
t hear the correct words is not the big deal. It is that they heard somethi=
ng! That is a start! These communications are very subjective and in my opi=
nion meant for the person who records them. The message heard and understoo=
d is for that person.

Hi Frank, I finally heard back from all the people I sent that recording to=
. This was the one that we thought said "ghost boxes". I thought I heard th=
is very clearly myself, but after all, you had told me these words=C2=A0in=
=C2=A0your email before I listened to the attached=C2=A0audio, so I knew I =
couldn't be totally objective about it. I sent the audio=C2=A0part of=C2=A0=
your video=C2=A0clip to 6 other people I know who are interested in this st=
uff. I did not tell them in advance what it was supposed to say or anything=
 about how it was recorded. 
Here's what I heard back from them:
=C2=A0

JD=
 - This sounds like it's from a sweep device such as the mini box or Frank'=
s box. I hear something like: "Mi=C2=A0 Mi -Chael Fine"=C2=A0 Then somethin=
g at the end.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
SR - The first word, "up", perhaps?=C2=A0 And th=
e second word either "goes" or "comes".=C2=A0 I think the third word was "m=
arket".=C2=A0 Someone using a spirit broker to predict the stock market?=C2=
=A0
=C2=A0
VM - It just sounds like radio static to me... like a frequency =
going in and out....=C2=A0
JL & ME said basically the same thing =E2=80=93 =
Just sounds like twirling the knobs on a radio.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
DC - I hear on=
e voice saying "Ghosts" ... Not sure what the rest says .. sounds funky .. =
not the usual EVP rhythm ...
=C2=A0
So 3 out of 6 people couldn't make out =
any words at all. One heard "up goes market" instead of "ghost boxes" and o=
ne heard something completely different. One person did come up with the wo=
rd "ghost", that was Debbie Caruso and she's the one of these 6 people with=
 the most experience EVP experience, in fact she has a version of a radio s=
weep box she calls a mini-box and has several recordings made with this dev=
ice posted to her website. (www.1800heaven. com)
=C2=A0
So I sent debbie th=
ose other audio clips=C2=A0you sent more recently, the ones with=C2=A0the "=
Nibiru" stuff,=C2=A0thinking that =C2=A0maybe she had "the best ear" for he=
aring the same things you hear. I renamed the audio file so she wouldn't ha=
ve any advance clues as to what it was supposed to be saying. Here's her re=
sponse:
=C2=A0
The second recording (the shorter one) is a part of the firs=
t one.=C2=A0 It's the same voice throughout that part of the recording but =
I can't understand what is being said.=C2=A0 "Kind of" heard the word "stre=
ssed"=C2=A0 but the phrase doesn't make any sense to me....=C2=A0 
=C2=A0
O=
f course to really be scientific about this we'd need to use more samples a=
nd survey a lot more people, but so far the evidence seems to confirm the p=
redictable results that some people are better than others at finding patte=
rns and meaning and secret messages=C2=A0within a set of random data. The s=
ame thing is true for EVP in general as well, people seldom agree on what t=
he "words" they hear actually say, but to me the significance of EVP is npt=
 the "content" of the message anyway, it is the fact (alleged fact?) that s=
omething showed up on the recording that can't be explained by any ordinary=
 methods or processes. 
=C2=A0
Well Frank, I know you're not gonna like=C2=
=A0this analysis and will probably find arguments against it, I'm just tryi=
ng to be honest, objective, and realistic. Hope you understand."
