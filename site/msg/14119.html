&gt; You mean the radio&#x27;s ? The problem is getting the chips and the coil sets.
&gt; I&#x27;m not a manufacturer, and that limits access. Using the same chips as
&gt; these radios I use, such as the car tuners, just results in a noisy radio,
&gt; most of the time they are not usable for boxes. This latest one though seems
&gt; promising...

&gt;&gt;   The problem I have is that it&#x27;s very time consumming to build the
&gt;&gt; boxes, I just don&#x27;t have time to make many. Now with RS discontiuing the
&gt;&gt; 469, and 820, I have to get my own radio design going.

&gt;&gt; Start out with the basics! cheapest as possible! any of these methods can
&gt;&gt; works as good as any other, like the water method, white noise, radio tuned
&gt;&gt; between stations, foreign language, IT DOES NOT MATTER--spirit will use what
&gt;&gt; you use. Don&#x27;t forget EVPmaker. You also have to develope an ear for the
&gt;&gt; voices, take your time!
