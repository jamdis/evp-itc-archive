They curse all the time, \nthat to me is proof enough that it&#39;s not the radio station.  I&#39;m not \na fan of them cursing, but that shows progress.

Everything is meant for a reason, the \nusers, the modifications and certain locations may be better at \ndifferent times of the day depending on the atmosphere and weather \nconditions.
