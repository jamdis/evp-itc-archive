<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce. I thought the images in your IAH gallery were very intriguing when I first saw 
them, seems like over a year ago.  I didn&#x27;t realize they were already posted here, nor that 
wouldn&#x27;t want a link to them posted.  Sorry about that.  

I do think the person on the other site brought up some valid concerns over how much 
enhancement has taken place, but as you pointed out, you have stated step by step what 
your process is so this allows others to freely decide to what degree they feel the original 
content has been altered.

I, myself, have been accused of photoshopping my images.  The main difference being 
that I haven&#x27;t done anything except for crop them from the larger frame in which they 
were originally seen.  The colors and images are as they were discovered during the review 
process.

And like yourself, I&#x27;m into the two-way stuff now.  I still squeeze in a few sessions here 
and there, but my ITC work has definitely taken a temporary back seat to other research.

&gt; Everyone,
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; This took place about a year ago the guy stole my images from IAH and put up this page 
in one day.
&gt; He was immediately put down and discredited and never surfaced again.
&gt; The images where there for everyone to scrutinize and they were posted on almost a 
daily basis for a while.
&gt; It&#x27;s like anything else in the paranormal, there will always be self appointed so called 
seekers of truth.
&gt;  
&gt; If you notice mine is the only item on the whole site. I don&#x27;t mind sceptics or 
questioning about how I got these images 
&gt; but this guy was an idiot. If he just would have asked, I would have explained what 
process I went through to bring 
&gt; the images out of the glare of the sunlight. As a matter of fact I had done a whole step 
by step instruction page on my previous website about the process. This creep was a self 
proclaimed photoshop expert and claimed my images were touched up.
&gt; So I gave him a raw image of mine and asked him to come up with the same result. That 
was the last I heard from him.
&gt;  
&gt; I did not put these images up to have to defend them, I just thought because of the 
interest that arose regarding Margaret&#x27;s images 
&gt; reminded me of my itc days, which are now long gone. My only interest is box research.
&gt;  
&gt; I don&#x27;t feel it was necessary to did up that idiots website and post the link with my IAH 
gallery, I did not post these pictures 
&gt; to prove anything just for curiosity sake.

&gt; Hi Bruce. I tried to find the gal&#x27;s website I saw before, but am not seeing it now. Just 
this:http://specterweb.tripod.com/specter/id19.html--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, 
&quot;bhali333&quot; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Margaret,&gt; &gt; Before I became 
engrossed in box research I had done tons of research &gt; with every method of ITC 
imaging.&gt; &gt; I did Video Loop, water reflection, crystal, mirror, you name it.&gt; And got 
pretty good results from most.&gt; &gt; My most astounding visual itc came from a dicovery in 
my home.&gt; I have a crystal window in the front door of my house facing west, &gt; when the 
sun starts to go down it shines through this crystal window &gt; and projects onto the walls 
in my family room.&gt; &gt; I was sitting watching tv one day and happenned to look over at &gt; 
something that caught my attention, when I looked over there was a &gt; face looking back. I 
ran to get my digital camera and that started a &gt; year long process of experiments and 
spirit images I name VPI (visual &gt; projection imaging) I have literally hundreds of detailed 
images of &gt; spirits that where reflected through the crystal onto the walls in my &gt; home. 
as far as I can discern the spirits were forming the images &gt; inside of the crystal window, 
and the sun was acting as sort of a &gt; slide or movie projecter. Projecting their images 
onto the walls when &gt; it came through the window.&gt; &gt; I had a page on I am haunted for 
the longest time, and drew quite a &gt; following for my images. Alas since I discovered box 
research I have &gt; not done one imaging session.&gt; &gt; What got my attention was the 
mention of the horse image. I also &gt; captured the image of a horse, very detailed and a 
cat that you would &gt; think was sitting right in the room.&gt; &gt; Maragaret, please post the 
link to your site I did not get it and I &gt; would love to take a look.&gt; &gt; If anyone is 
interested let me know and I&#x27;ll post some of my images.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt;
