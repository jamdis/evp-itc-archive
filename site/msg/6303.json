I bought it and hacked it at the table at the pizza place at \nlunch, it took like 3 minutes to do.  If anybody is interested than \nsend me a private e-mail and i will explain further.  I&#39;m 2 for 2 with \nmy efforts so far in duplicating the original idea by Sum, maybe i&#39;ve \nbeen put on this path by them ????\n\nThanx Guys,\n-Steve H."}
