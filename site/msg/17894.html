Hey Fiona, yes EVP is the focus of the group yest it is. So, what does that=
 have to do with superstitious nonsense? Please tell me? Can we not keep th=
e subject about EVP?
=C2=A0
I am sorry but I thought this was a serious gro=
up about EVP phenomena. Instead its a sympathetic shallow collection of you=
ng minds. 
=C2=A0
I am moving on and Snowfire may Jesus save you from the b=
east and from his dad.

Hi,

I'm generally in lurk mode due to some offline priorities that need my=
 immediate attention. I'll probably be fairly silent through mid-July, but =
I had to speak up when this email crossed my desk.

While I don't share Sno=
wfire's views in most cases, I've always enjoyed the links & banter. The re=
cordings are always interesting... and isn't that the focus of this group?
=

I'm not thrilled with ultimatums, as if the group isn't big enough (or big=
-hearted enough) to include diverse views, respectfully shared.

My two cen=
ts: Snowfire, please don't leave!

In haste,
Fiona
