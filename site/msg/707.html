<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>well so far,   the voices call our name when we are either watching tv,
working on the computer or trying to sleep.
they call the cats too, and the cats go running to them.
they are crystal clear voices, and just come about at the oddest times.,
but they call family members by name.  they usually are behind the
person....and will then call their name.   its become a running joke in our
family now  as this has gone on for 10 years.
I bought a voice activated tape recorder... in hopes of capturing this on
tape. but no luck yet,.
I was told to take Pics around the house to look for orbs and such.  we have
never &#x27;seen&#x27; anything, but we&#x27;ve seen activity,  books that get picked up
off the shelf, suspend in air and then drop to the floor (that one scared my
son &amp; I as we were eatchign tv when it happened), doors that open and close
thru out the day &amp; night when I am only one home.
chair cushions that were yanked down while I sat there and watched it... and
the one that surprised us all is our house has an odd freestanding fireplace
with a round platform with white rocks.   something kicked the rocks one
evening while we watched tv, and the rocks flew across the room.___
I  was impress in ghost hunters and how they captured voices on recorders.
and thought that might help us solve this.    we dont have ghosts, we dont
have orbs,m we just have something that calls us by name, calls the cats,
and moves things in the house.

&gt; Welcome Lyn;
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m not sure how to advise you. Sometimes you need some kind of background
&gt; nosie for the spirits to make a voices out of, like running water, a fan,
or
&gt; white noise. I have my own method I use, but I don&#x27;t have anything I can
&gt; offer at the moment. Often it takes several attempts before you get
results.
