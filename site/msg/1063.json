This is a prototype dual \n&gt;phototransistor optical mic. It&#39;s a very simple device. I turned up the \n&gt;levels on the radio and now I can hear some &#39;control tones&#39; between voices. \n&gt;I have heard these tones in the past very faint. The first voice is robotic \n&gt;the second normal\n&gt;&quot;Good testing his circuit....That&#39;s awesome&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Dave\n&gt;\n&gt;--- vfp19968@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;From: &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Optical?\n&gt;Date: Thu, 5 Apr 2007 12:27:40 -0700\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, the speaker is about a foot from the lamp/phototransistor combo. \n&gt;Volume has to be adjusted so the mic does not overload, it is a touchy \n&gt;adjustment of audio and flame level. If the flame is set too high the unit \n&gt;generates lots of noise from the flutter of the flame. Also the room should \n&gt;be dark and computer monitor turned down to reduce noise the mic will pick \n&gt;up produced stray light sources.\n&gt;\n&gt;--- franks-boxes@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;From: &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Optical?\n&gt;Date: Thu, 05 Apr 2007 13:17:13 -0600\n&gt;\n&gt;So you play the audio from the radio out in the room, and record with the\n&gt;optic setup?\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Exercise your brain!
