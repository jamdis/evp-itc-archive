 Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: New file uploaded to EVP-ITC


    I have been a lu=
rker here for sometime... I find the subject fascinating, but my tecnnical =
skills are so limited I rarely feel like I can contribute anything to the g=
roup. This post touched me so deeply, though, I felt I had to reply.

  I h=
ave lost a number of well loved animal companions over the years, from Blac=
k Labs to White Ferrets to cats of various persuasions. (The most recent be=
ing a tawny colored short-hair named O'Rafferty, who looked like a pigmy pu=
ma.) 

  While I have little experience with animal EVP's, I have no doubt =
that I will see them all again someday. If they are not waiting for me on t=
he other side, I'm not going...

  Would love to see posts from anyone that=
 has experience with animal EVP's or other proof of companion animal surviv=
al. Do those on the other side have anything to say about this subject?

  =
I deeply sympathise with your loss... Just reading your post brought tears =
to my eyes.
