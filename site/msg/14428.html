The problem with it Jim is that there is no way to "clean" the audio withou=
t effecting the stuff you want to keep as well. At least not with the cheap=
y softwares. I head the Adobe Audition is much better at it, but still not =
perfect.

But again, enhance all you want, just make sure you keep the orig=
inal unaltered.
