Haha cheers Zack. yeah I got to admit Im only just starting to get vocal on=
 here but I definately want to keep up to date with Franks work. I had a be=
e under my bonnet from a comment chris moon made and also when I question h=
is experiment and he couldnt answer he acted like a complete ass. Well i de=
finately want to learn more about the methods! im in the UK and to be hones=
t not much goes on here in the field of paranormal apart from pointless tv =
shows where people bump into each other and freak out.

once again sorry fo=
r the mix up guys :-)


Kind Regards

This is getting ridiculous now, you should stop writing these posts, all =

I have offered many time=

I have made the same challenge to your friend moon who we all know is behin=

type of audio file
to be publicly posted for revue and continues to take ad=

I was the only one to confront him in public and expose hi=

it was when you and I first met, moon just continues to use it to rip peopl=

Just the fact that he has you doing =
his dirty work shows the type of guy he is. I can remember a time when you =
publicly came out against any type of money making using your boxes and eve=

Frank you are better than this, just concentrate=

he is finished in the paranormal and he knows it, everyone is wise to his g=

Frank you are hitching you wagon to =
a dead horse. Get away from these bad influences before they ruin your repu=

We have had this moon discussion in the past and once he h=

any times before.

Frank, I like and respect you and I hope you will consid=
