 Finally got the radio to work, as near perfect as possi=
ble. It's like a
big DAH! I kept trying to use an antenna amplifier, and it=
 was
overloading the radio, making it sound like crap. Curiously, I drew my=

schematics with no antenna amp! The MK484 final IF works kick butt!
 
 I w=
as playing with the radio last night and just couldn't make it work
right, =
so turned it off and went to take a shower, while in the shower
it occured =
to me what I was doing wrong. Yet again, no help from the
outisde! ---or wa=
s there? Edison could not have made "a box" in his day,
I think most fo the=
 radios were TRF, and I couldn't get any ghost voices
with the TRF radio. O=
f course, that's just one researcher, and a couple
tests. If the box only f=
unctions as a raw audio source, any radio should
work. 
 
 The MK484 IF was=
 off an oriental site, it was the only thing not in
Chinese/Japanese.
