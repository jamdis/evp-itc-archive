I had \n&gt; asked our technicians Mike and Lisa if they can bring John Lennon \n&gt; foward to speak with me and they did.  John Lennon has been my idol \n&gt; all my life and today is the 27 year anniversary of his death.  Mike \n&gt; and Lisa work very well with me in contacting the ones i try to get \n&gt; to.  In the next post you will hear the file i got, which may be the \n&gt; best file i ever got with any radio or box.  I asked if John was aware \n&gt; of how he died and he responded &quot;Yes, Bullet&quot;.  As everyone probably \n&gt; knows that John Lennon was shot outside his home in NYC in 1980.  I \n&gt; can&#39;t believe that our friends on the other side are so comfortable \n&gt; with me, that they keep exceeding my expectations of what i will hear \n&gt; through any of these devices.  I also have other files from this \n&gt; session, but this was the most important one and proves that i am \n&gt; speaking with spirits on another plane.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;\n = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = WOW! Steve, congratulations on contacting John Lennon, that&#39;s SOoooo Cool! I hope he can continue to give some messages, so as to prove life after death and help us communicate with the Spirit Entities there!  &lt;[8-D    =Judy="}
