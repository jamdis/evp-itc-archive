While doing some research I came across a very bad schematic of one, that the originator even admitted didn&#39;t work.   I was wondering if anybody had built one or even knew where I could get the drawings for one?   I thought about using a fan motor out of a small fan, but I want something with a little more control.  I&#39;m almost thinking of using the motors and such from a microwave.   They would give off very high emf readings, just not sure how to do it...yet.   Thanks in advance!!!"}
