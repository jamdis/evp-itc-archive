There are some that do have this capability. I believe mine does, though I =
have not used that function. I have the Olympus WM-300. It is a little more=
 expensive brand new, I believe like $160 or something, but I bought mine r=
efurbished for $60.

Anyway, I will try it to make sure, but I am pretty su=
re you can rewind and relisten, not having to go back to the beginning.

      DVR, as in digital voice recorder. I'm no=
