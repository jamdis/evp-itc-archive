<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This is exactly what I expect is happening. Sum said the site would  
be down &quot;in the near term,&quot; which made me think he making  
modifications to be sure that the corporation cannot bother him again.

&gt; If it is in fact a cease-and-desist notice from Radio Shack, it
&gt; wouldn&#x27;t be the first time they (RS) have done this. I receieved a
&gt; cease-and-desist notice from Radio Shack many years ago when I was
&gt; modifying their radio scanner products and posting them on the web.
&gt; Guess what... if you go to scanshack.com you can still see step-by-
&gt; step instructions on how I modified their scanners, with detailed
&gt; drawings I did.
&gt; They (RS/Tandy at that time) lost that battle with me, or I should
&gt; say their lawyer lost that battle with me.
&gt; But, as you said... we shall wait and see what is up with this issue.

&gt; &gt; Judy, and everyone else, too--please don&#x27;t promote or continue

&gt; at
&gt; &gt; all. My concern is that he has received a cease-and-desist notice
&gt; &gt; from Radio Shack, which may have been informed that someone was
&gt; &gt; promoting their product in a way not in compliment with their
&gt; &gt; corporate image, and that his counsel is advising he comply with
&gt; it.
&gt; &gt; What you are telling people to do may be exactly what his own
&gt; legal
&gt; &gt; counsel is advising against and may put him in a precarious
&gt; situation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Please just calm down and don&#x27;t make assumption until he can
&gt; clarify
&gt; &gt; for us. If it comes down to someone making personal threats
&gt; against
&gt; &gt; him, that&#x27;s a whole other matter. But he needs to ask for help
&gt; before
&gt; &gt; everyone goes all posse, OK?
