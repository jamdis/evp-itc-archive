Per sharons request.\nI believe this is a good way to post some files from time to time just \nto see what other researchers hear that you deem clear.\n\nI&#39;m sure this will be interesting given the fact that some people hear \nthe same message differently on purpous if the entity that sent it \nmeant it for the researcher alone to hear. This experiment over time \nwill tell us if messages recieved by individual researchers fall into \nto types of categories IE general and personal.\n\nI suggest we listen to the unlabeled file give an opinion on what we \nhear and when the opinions are in then the file can be posted with what \nthe researcher that recieved it hears and then listened to again  by \nall to see if anyone changes thier mind and how much is the titles \npower of suggestion over the listener.\n\ngood luck and lets try to accomplish this experiment.\n\nBruce"}
