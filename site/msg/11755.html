<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My personal preference is to run the box/hack through a speaker with a
recorder set up to record the box and any questions we ask or comments
we make while listening.  I would keep things as simple as as you can,
so either go straight into the recorder or record the speaker.  You
can certainly experiment, but I like to use the same set-up as much as
i can and keep it as portable as possible since we experiment at
different locations.

&gt; Do you guys think I need to run the 469 and the mic into a mixer, then
&gt; run the mixer into the Olympus. Do you think that would work? If so,
&gt; any suggestions as to a good mixer to use?
