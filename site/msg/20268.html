<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, I remember Steve! There&#x27;s still the occasional argument and
debunker/skeptic that shows up from time to time, and I have my moods in my
old age.

 My focus has always been just the boxes, Just trying to make the stuff
keeps me too busy. I don&#x27;t have alot of interested in haunted objects or
locations, but thanks to TV, like Ghost Hunters, and ghost adventures, I see
enough to make me wonder, plus discussions here.

&gt; Hi Frank, hi group I&#x27;m glad to see there&#x27;s a place this topic can be
&gt; discussed without the nasty junk I&#x27;ve seen spouted in a few places on the
&gt; web and Frank I&#x27;m sorry to see you have to suffer that my friend you do not
&gt; deserve it..
&gt;
&gt; I closed the old forum where Frank kindly came along and shared his
&gt; information with us a few years ago but great to see this forum and thanks
&gt; for accepting me..
&gt;
&gt; We do work with haunted dolls and spirits. My wife has 100 plus dolls and a
&gt; non commercial site haunteddolls.net where we show them and talk about
&gt; them. The few EVP&#x27;s are a little out of date - they were got in the usual
&gt; way but it would be cool to have a ghost box because the spiritual events in
&gt; this place are 24/7..
&gt;
&gt; Apologies if I&#x27;ve missed it and there&#x27;s already a post on the subject but
&gt; whats the best approach to a randomly scanning receiver as opposed to one
&gt; that just scans sequentially ?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks ! Steve Gunn
