No, one doesn&#x27;t usually hear them like two humans speaking aloud. I  
receive a blend of images and meaning. Sometimes, I see words on a  
blackboard--a trick I was taught by my guides when I was very young.

John Edwards is clarvoyant, not claraudient, same as me--which  
doesn&#x27;t mean either of us aren&#x27;t in real communication. The only time  
I hear dead people with my ears is through EVP and my minibox.
