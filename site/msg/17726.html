Yes it is going off topic, but just to make sure all the facts are here:

-=
 Mr Moon does solicit clients and charge for readings.=C2=A0 His Haunted Ti=
mes web site notes that (but doesn't print prices, which is usually a conce=
rn for me when someone doesn't).=C2=A0 So if he's giving out Haunted Times =
magazines, it's like advertising.

- On Chris' blog last year, he announced=
 his=C2=A0 DISCOUNT was $300/hour!:

      Hi,



Chris and I were both speake=
rs at an event in Canada.  (And, for the record: No speaker's fees were inv=
olved.  I think most of us were there to share our latest research, meet fa=
ns, and -- in our spare time -- sit around over coffee and catch up with ot=
hers in this field.) 



Chris' table was across the aisle from mine at the=
 tradeshow; neither of us were "selling" anything.  I was signing autograph=
s (free), posing for photos with fans, and talking with anyone and everyone=
 who had a question or an opinion to share.  



Chris and Dina answered qu=
estions and gave out (free) copies of Haunted Times.



I had ample opportu=
nity to watch and hear pretty much everything that was going on at their ta=
ble.  It was a very small tradeshow, with maybe a dozen tables.  



I hear=
d Chris' presentation both times he talked.  He was hilariously funny, as h=
e described his work in paranormal research, with some references to the bo=
x and how surprised he'd been that it actually worked.  



Chris did not c=
lose with anything even vaguely resembling a pitch for business.  I don't t=
hink he mentioned that he was willing to do readings, during or after the e=
vent. 



At the tradeshow, I never once saw or heard anything that involve=
d "selling," asking people for money, or soliciting "private clientele." 

=


If I'd seen or heard anything questionable, I'd have distanced myself fro=
m Chris in a hurry.  (In case you're not familiar with my standards, my "Sc=
ams and Con Artists" article has been widely reprinted. People who are in t=
his field for the money usually do NOT like me.)



I believe that Chris us=
ually charges for his time, and that seems fair to me. I know one person wh=
o paid him for a reading; it definitely did not involve "hundreds of dollar=
s an hour."  (It was considerably less than what many psychics charge.) She=
 was thrilled with the answers she received, as they resolved a long-standi=
ng question she'd had.  



I heard several other people rave about Chris' =
readings; I'm not sure if they were paid readings or something that -- like=
 my experience -- had been heard in a public setting, out of the blue.



I=
 heard no one say anything less than glowing about Chris.  I did hear negat=
ive things about at least one other speaker, so don't get the idea that eve=
ryone was simply starry-eyed.



This was a low-budget event. Those of us w=
ho were there... we were there for the fun of getting together with others =
who are interested in paranormal studies.  There were crypto specialists, g=
host enthusiasts, vampire experts, and I even got to meet Al Peacock of "Co=
njuring Up Philip" fame.



There is a lot of gossip in this field.  I wish=
 there wasn't... but there is.  People seem to feel safe talking in the thi=
rd person, so I'm sorry if I bristle when I hear "one suspects" or anything=
 that's not a first-person observation.  Too often, it's turned out to be s=
omething taken out of context.  



I try to look at the facts objectively,=
 and usually in-person.



Everyone has a learning curve trying to find a w=
ay to work full-time in this field and still pay the rent. I've made mistak=
es and I'm sure Chris has, too; we all stumble along, seeing what works and=
 what's a Very Bad Idea.



I judge people on what I see when they're in th=
e spotlight and out of it.  I see what they're like when they're upbeat, as=
 well as running on adrenaline and caffeine, during the final hours of an e=
xhausting multi-day event.



I double-check their claims, and I listen car=
efully to people who've had readings with them, if they're giving readings =
(paid or free).



To be blunt, I'm working in a field where we've recently=
 discovered a couple of child molesters posing as ghost experts.  Ick! 



=
"Cautious" is an understatement, for how many of us now look at anyone who =
presents themselves as an authority.  We just can't risk being tarred, even=
 with the "charlatan" brush.



That's all way off-topic here, but I want t=
o be sure that I describe my experiences clearly and completely. 



Sincer=
ely,

Fiona
