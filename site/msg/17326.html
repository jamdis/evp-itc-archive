<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>More than enough to show any one in the world that reads these posts how
100% unreasonable, unyielding, and ignorant these self proclaimed skeptics
truly are. They expect all of us to buy their version of what EVP and the
paranormal really is, all imagination, and anyone that disagrees gets
attacked. Time and time again the three here side steped the issue that they
completely ignore all evidence, and all expereince of just about anyone else
on the this group. Intead over an over imply it&#x27;s all imiagination and
delusion, and only they are smart enough to decern the truth.

 The follwing is right off he home page. I don&#x27;t rmember when I started thsi
group, buyt htis has benn a couple years or so.


&quot;
Try not to get too religious, some discussion will be tolerated as long as
no one is offended. There is a &quot;banned&quot; button for those that get too
obnoxious. I don&#x27;t mind a good argument as long as it&#x27;s not taken too
serious, and people get pissed off, or hurt feelings. Try to be considerate
of others! *If I detect attempts at debunking, I&#x27;ll ban immediately! It&#x27;s
one thing to be skeptical, it&#x27;s another to ignore and deny all evidence.* &quot;

 Ignore and deny is excatly what these three skeptics are doing.
