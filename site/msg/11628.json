Sounded like you used the allophone file for the raw\n&gt; &gt; audio. Ive had some good results using Stefans evpmaker software. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I did. I think that sample was the allophone slowed by 20%.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What else other than white noise / allophone do people use?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ~ Becca\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; ____________________________________________________________\n&gt; Compete with the big boys.
