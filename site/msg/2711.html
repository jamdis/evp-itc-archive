Dave , 
 
 
I think you have my replies to your posts confused with Steve H=
ultay's posts .
I never insinuated that you were a fake or an idiot. if you=
 just look down at my post 
you will see I never mentioned telephones or sh=
uffling or anything in the background of your recordings.
 
as a matter of =
fact I make it a point never to criticise any one's work whether I hear it =
or not I just
offer my opinion on if I do or do not hear what the poster he=
ars. so please make sure you are getting defensive with the right
person. T=
he remark about answering the phone was meant that the voice saying hello s=
ounded like your voice and 
you may have inadvertently recorded your self a=
nd not realized it, it was not meant to insinuate fraud or fake.
 
Also as =
far as you doing paranormal research for 30 years, that may very well be an=
d I respect that but it still does not make
me hear any of the files you po=
sted. How am I supposed to know that you have been involved in this field f=
or thirty years
It sounded to me like you were just getting started as my r=
ecordings sounded when I got started with evp 10 years ago.
A polite no tha=
nk you to my offer of help would have been enough.
 
I find that when ever =
someone offers an opinion in this paranormal investigative community that i=
mmediately the recipient takes 
personal offence and thinks they are being =
accused of fraud, and that includes myself on many occasions.
 
so lighten =
up Dave, we are all friends here.

lo, first off you need to know that I am not new to evp's. I have been low =
budget recording for at least 4 years and involved with the paranormal for =
over 30 years. I use a cheap olympus digital recorder and am very careful a=
bout the conditions i record. There was no " pipe banging" and I wasnt anyw=
here near a telephone All my evp's are " real". Just because you cant ( or =
wont) hear them doesnt mean that they are "shuffling or natural noise". I c=
an hear them and other people can hear them and that is enough for me. As i=
 said i have been involved with the paranormal for many years and this has =
been a problem. If you cant hear what I hear or see what I see doesnt mean =
that im and idiot or faker.
