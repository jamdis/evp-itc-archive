&gt; 
&gt; Hi Kristin. I can hear the &quot;yes it does&quot; part. I looked up some of the
&gt; meanings of the word 
&gt; &#x27;portal&#x27; and found this:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;A portal in fiction is a magical or technological doorway that connects two
&gt; distant 
&gt; locations.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose in this regard the &#x27;ghost boxes&#x27; or radios used in sweep with the
&gt; intent of 
&gt; communication could be considered a portal of sorts, but if that is the
&gt; case, then wouldn&#x27;t 
&gt; our digital recorders (which can be used by those in spirit to produce EVP
&gt; even when it is 
&gt; not our intent) and televisions, camcorders, ordinary cameras, etc (used by
&gt; those in spirit 
&gt; to show their images, again, with our without our intent) also be portals? I
&gt; recently got an 
&gt; EVP voicemail from my next door neighbor&#x27;s mother, saying her name, and when
&gt; reversed, 
&gt; the message is &quot;I love you.&quot; So I guess we&#x27;d have to toss telephones and
&gt; computers onto 
&gt; the list as well.
&gt; 
&gt; I think the truth is, those in spirit can (and do!) basically go wherever
&gt; they want, whenever 
&gt; they choose, and do not require our permission or our technology to do so.
&gt; The only thing 
&gt; the technology does is allow us to be aware of their presence, which in many
&gt; cases would 
&gt; have gone by unnoticed, if not for our use of the equipment. 
&gt; 
&gt; Just my thoughts on the subject. :0)

&gt; &gt; Hey guys -I sent a message that apparently got lost in the
&gt; &gt; stratosphere but I sent this clip because I asked about the radio as a
&gt; &gt; portal thing back in early March and I got a fairly definite
&gt; &gt; affirmative answer on that. But who knows. I have have given
&gt; &gt; completely opposing views before but it is something to chew on.
