In \n#4 I had a square wave generator with variable frequency, that sound \nwas mixed in with the radio audio and seemed to produce \nlouder/longer/clearer voices. I put this function in #24, and 24 \nworks the best out of the systems that used the LA1816 chip for a \nradio. I don&#39;t get that much time to play actually use this stuff.\n \n A square wave is preferred because the output contains all \nharmonics. The circuits are simple, and can easily be made on \nbreadboard, or perf board from Radio shack. The mixer is a very \nsimple circuit as well, or sound mixers can be purchased. \n\n It was with these boxes, and one that I had tried to use a shield on \nthre tuner module, creating RF interference, that produced the \nclearest, and longest messages. \n\n I suggest people really interested in advancing the research go get \na book on basic electronics instead of constantly trying to re-invent \nthe wheel. I&#39;m not saying mechanical methods are a &quot;re-invention&quot;, \nyou just have to have a way to interface it to spirit, and I think \nthat takes electricity/electronics.\n\n Frank-S"}
