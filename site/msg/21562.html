I alway had the EVP thing happen to me on a nomal radio. I tried to explain=
 that 
I had EVPs on the radio since the early 70's. Back then people would=
 think EVP 
was evil and many would attack me even though I was under age. =
I also explained 
EVP to many people because I had a vision of how too do G=
hostbox by flipping the 
radio dial. I also explained:=C2=A0Songs can be us=
ed like Tarot cards! Anything can 
speak to a person like the wind for exam=
ple..

Besides having visions I also used to sing songs on the radio years =
before they 
came out. The news recorded me many times singing songs and wa=
rning of things 
before they happened. That's how I got to do movie/rock st=
ar readings and warned 
of things like 9/11 to politicians and put things i=
n the media like "The plane! 
The plane!" on Fantacy Island. http://youtu.b=
e/_xG7Qwv23sg=C2=A0that would warn of 
the 9/11 terror attacks or actually =
warning of the conspiricy with-in and that 
someone was doing something.
Th=
e 9/11 emergency phone number is also a warning of =C2=A09/11 terror attack=
s and 
the feeling someone was going to do something.
What I am saying is=
=C2=A0I was there (in the 70's)with the politicians in Canada 
warning of 9=
/11 to Americain politicians=C2=A0saying we would make the emergency 
phone=
 number the same accross north America and what the number meant. 

We also=
 spoke of the TV shows that warned of 9/11. Fantacy Island, SCTV and many 
=
other tv shows or songs that would have a 9/11 feeling. SCTV is a great exa=
mple 
of this=C2=A0where all of Canada was saying "Take-off eh. Like you kn=
ow eh, you 
hosers you know." It even became a hit song. http://youtu.be/1B=
FPt001PYU Rush 
sang with the SCTV comediens Bob and Doug and it became a l=
arge part of a 
Canadian's identity, "Like you know,eh?"(a psychic expressi=
on like we all know)
I did this type of thing for many TV shows, movies, so=
ngs and politicians of 
many countries. I put my image in some of it and it=
 shows too.
The whole time people have been trying to dismiss me, get me to=
 loose me 
jobs,loose =C2=A0girlfriend and =C2=A0friends. And People tried =
to kill me. My 
ex-girlfriend said my baby it not mine and everyone believe=
s her, so I lost my 
kid!
Now I am a psychic for=C2=A0adviser network.
Sonn=
y Psychic

=C2=A0

=C2=A0I don't know how many hundreds of box voices I have posted over the y=

few if any are heard by anyone, yet if I use other methods, like=
 EVPmaker, or as 
recently, just pushing the buttons on my truck radio whil=
