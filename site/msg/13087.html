Hi Rhonda,

My opinion follows:
What y=
ou are seeing is for entertainment purposes. The production 
companies know=
 that they can not capture and keep an audience with 
slow or no action, an=
d a theme that drags on.
They need that high energy spark to keep the viewe=
rs coming back, 
especially viewers who are not able to get out and do inve=
stigations 
as much as they'd like or for those that have never done an 
in=
vestgation, but like ghost hunting stuff.

Their show ratings depend on vie=
wer numbers which equate to 
advertising dollars. That is the bottom line f=
or any show and 
entertainment venue on TV or radio.

So... what you are se=
eing with all that over-drama stuff is for 
entertainment and shouldn't be =
taken as serious investigation.

That's how I see it at least, and that's w=
hy I don't usually watch 
those type shows, although I will check them out =
once-in-awhile to 
see if they are using any type of new tool or paranormal=
 device.

Shows like "Haunting Evidence' that don't have screamng, running,=
 and 
constant yapping when none should be happening, don't last.
'Haunting=
 Evidence' was just dropped from the TruTV lineup. They 
tried to be a more=
 serious documentary type show, whether they really 
were or not? But it di=
dn't work for the rating numbers.

I think you'll be seeing more and more o=
f the 'entertainment' type 
investigation shows being put on a number of di=
fferent networks, 
because that's what's selling right now.

Rhonda, the ty=
pe of good manners investigation you are describing 
does happen I'm guessi=
ng in many groups around the world, when a 
production company is not invol=
ved. Get that production company 
involved... and the entertainment factor =
takes over.
