<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Can I do a Scole thing with somebody? I&#x27;ve got Skype-- Can I phone it  
in from Western Maryland?

;)  (But a smidge more than halfway serious)

Anyway, I&#x27;ll listen to the C2C show tomorrow and see how it went. Let  
you know what I think then.

&gt;  We were supposedly working together to do a &quot;Scole&quot; like thing  
&gt; here weekly starting last month, but that quickly bit the dust as  
&gt; Moon doesn&#x27;t seem to understand weekly, nor consistencey, as the  
&gt; first voices requested. He also never said anything about being on  
&gt; C2C again, and &quot;Frank&#x27;s Box&quot; will be  specifically discussed, as  
&gt; mentioned in the show promo on the C2C site. I think niether Moon,  
&gt; nor the C2C staff want facts to interfere with the discussions! I  
&gt; think he can stick his &quot;Scole&quot; meetings, and any other scams up his  
&gt; -----, and may he get the spirit contacts he deserves!

&gt; Paranormal investigator and editor of Haunted Times  
&gt; Magazine,Christopher Moonwill discuss hauntings as well as his work  
&gt; with Frank&#x27;s Box, a device which summons the dead&quot;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Great, once again making public claims about a system he&#x27;s never  
&gt; paid a dime for, makes untold amounts of money with, has no  
&gt; knowledge of how it works, and what it&#x27;s really for....on and on!  
&gt; better hit send before I really get pissed!

&gt; Frank-- are you and he speaking or on the outs? I think I may have  
&gt; missed a rapprochement between you this summer when I was off in  
&gt; the wilderness camping.
