&gt;  After a long discussion, and at times a yelling match with Chris 
Moon on the phone...I have like zero memory for verbal stuff, 
basically I think it came down to he said-she said type deal. I could 
agree with some of what Mr Moon said, but the bottom line is--I don&#x27;t 
care! I have had enough of these endless pissing contests, one person 
telling me one thing, someone else telling me something else. I&#x27;m not 
wise enough to tell who is telling the truth. I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;m not 
discussing this stuff anymore, I&#x27;m not making boxes anymore. I have 
absolutely no interest in the so called paranormal. I don&#x27;t sell this 
shit, I don&#x27;t make any money, all it does eat all my time and piss me 
off. I&#x27;ll finish this last box I&#x27;m working on, and that&#x27;s it. No more 
e-mails, no more discussion--I have had it!
&gt;  
&gt;  Mr Moon said he would be glad to come on the group and answer 
question--so there ya go, now is your chance. I&#x27;m not going to be the 
go between, nor will I participate.
