Trouble is,\nthere&#39;s too many whack jobs out there wanting to be the world&#39;s onlyest box\nexpert, or the ones desperately grieving, or lately, religious nuts!\n\n I&#39;ve said it over and over and over and over and over and over--expectation\nwill create the voices you want to hear. If you are seeking Jesus, that is\nexactly what you are going to get and you&#39;ll swear it&#39;s God gospel freaking\ntruth, and the rest of us should bow down to you. I think y&#39;all know who I&#39;m\ntalking about.\n\n I am uncertain if one can ask for certain spirits, or if even that tends to\ncreate what one wans. I think maybe it works the same as the above. I don&#39;t\nask for any specific spirits/entities, I don&#39;t ask questions, I just let\nthem talk and try not to influance it. If I have question, I might think it,\nand most of the time they&#39;ll answer, wiht out me asking.  That could be just\ncreating want I want to hear as well--don&#39;t know.\n\n I don&#39;t have to be on these groups and I don&#39;t have make  boxes, except for\nmy own use. I think the messages are personal in nature, no one is going to\nhear it the same, and it&#39;s about worthless as &quot;evidence&quot;. We get enough\nthat&#39;s shareable to show others that it&#39;s real, and I think that is about\nthe best that can be hoped for. I think, and it is only my opinion, that\n&quot;evidence&quot; at so called haunted areas is just what is expected, I really\ndon&#39;t think it proves anything.\n\n Then, there the bullies that want all this to conform to their wishes, and\nwe saw more examples of that with the recent e-bay auction, and y&#39;all know\nwho you are! If no one sells boxes, no one builds boxes, its&#39; that simple!\nParts and radios are not free, and why the hell should we be expected to\nspend endless hours on this stuff for nothing!?\n\n I know, I know --sacrilege!-- I should be banned from all groups and box\nwork, burned at the stake, tarred and feathered, run out of town on rail,\nhow dare I say anything!?\n\n Frank S\n\nI ge eques s o boxes, and I hink some ge o ended ha I don' jus whip ou a box and h ow i a hem o \" hei esea ch\".
