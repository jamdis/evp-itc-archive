Frank dont let it get to you, You have balls to create technology which ans=
wers are curisosity, all because people dont get told the stuff they want t=
o hear they cant hold you responsible. i think the boxes are great technolo=
gy, not many people have the "can do" to go and investigate and=A0build som=
ething that captures the unexplained. keep up the good work and ignore nega=
tivity! Im sure you have the backing of people who frequently post on here.=
 I think their has been a massive overeaction in the recent posts and I hop=
e we can move on from it. dont be discourages...you have the majority backi=
ng, seems like EVP frustrates people. I took your advice over the emails we=
 exchanged and just take this as a scientific experiment...not a source of =
faith or answers. they are just personalities like us. im still shocked we =
get voices!!!!

keep up the good work!
