<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>There is no pulsing on the older style 12-470, just clear 
communication.  My 12-469 is sitting in the corner and i&#x27;ll probably 
never touch it again because that constant pulse noise is very 
distracting to get past to hear any audible messages.  That&#x27;s just my 
personal opinion anyway for what it&#x27;s worth.  If you listen to my 
radio shack files from today you will hear the difference between the 
two boxes.  The sweep between the two are both linear, but one has 
the pulse sound and one is just a clean sweep without the pulse.  Ask 
your local radio shack if they have any 12-470 older style models, 
they are gray with a white top and also has a built in speaker.  The 
new 470 is all black and can&#x27;t be modified as of yet but i think Mike 
C. could figure it out if he didn&#x27;t have 500 other projects going at 
the same time....lol  Any questions just shoot me an e-mail and i 
will help the best i can.

&gt; Steve, hope your holidays were wonderful. We haven&#x27;t had the chance 
to
&gt; speak in a few weeks.
&gt; What are the difference in the 469 and the 470 besides 2 channel vs.
&gt; 4? You are still choosing one channel and it is still a linear sweep
&gt; right? Technically, what would be the difference in choosing AM on 
the
&gt; 469 and AM on the 470? The pulsing sound is absolutely annoying.

&gt; &gt; Had a pretty good session today, i&#x27;ve been pretty blocked with 
other 
&gt; &gt; boxes yet i seem to always get great results with the RS 12-470.  
Some 
&gt; &gt; really good responses to my questions.  Hey babs, i think you 
should 
&gt; &gt; give the RS box a little time and maybe you will start to get 
stuff.  
&gt; &gt; Although i have a 12-469 also and it really sux compared to the 
12-
&gt; &gt; 470.  The constant pulsing noise in the 469 model just drives me 
crazy 
&gt; &gt; enough to not concentrate.  Try looking for an older style model 
of the 
&gt; &gt; 12-470, that&#x27;s probably the best radio i own hands down.  Instant 
&gt; &gt; results always and consistently.  All my boxes work, but they are 
&gt; &gt; finicky sometimes.  No need to comment to my posted files guys, 
just 
&gt; &gt; listen and see if i&#x27;m on some sort of a right track with the 
&gt; &gt; communication.
