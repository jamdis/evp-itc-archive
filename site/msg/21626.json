Andy was apparantly bombarded with probes to modify and mine was in the batch with the rest.\n\nI also was informed that this probe that i modified myself is an older model of what Andy used to use, but he no longer does.\n\nThey offered to make good on my lost device, which makes them top notch in my book and i no longer feel taken advantage of. \n\nI look forward to seeing their new work and devices some day.\n\n-Steve  \n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, urkel23@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Did a quick test with the inductive probe, it&#39;s the same one that Andy  \n&gt; Coppock uses.
