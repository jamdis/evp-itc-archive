<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Robin,

I&#x27;m sorry this is happening to you.  Whether the seller knew it had a 
problem or not is one for the guessing game.  If the seller used the 
phone on a regular basis, more than just turning it on, I&#x27;m sure 
he/she knew of the short charge time... but if they just deal on ebay 
in used phones they may have just done a quick funtional test and 
then turned the phone off, not knowing the problem existed, then 
putting it on ebay.

Anyway... to the problem itself.  I&#x27;m assuming from your post that 
the phone does work, but will just not work for very long, draining 
the battery within a very short period of time.
If this is the case, (IMHO) I have to wonder where they get 
the &quot;water damage&quot; explanation from..??  Now, water can damage a 
piece of electronics equipment if the equipment is on when the water 
makes contact.  The water could act like a conductor and make 
connections internally where connections would not normally be made, 
causing components to go bad because of excess current, voltage, etc.
But, if a unit is off, water may or may not do damage depending if 
there is something that can be damaged just by getting wet (like 
speakers, etc.)
But, since your unit appears to work, just draining the battery to 
quickly... I have a very hard time understanding the &quot;water damage&quot; 
thing they told you.

Since a new battery is doing the same thing as the old, that phone is 
draining the battery because something, which uses a lot of current, 
appears to be on all the time, or something is being shorted (or 
turned on) causing current drain (even if the phone appears to be 
off), while still allowing the phone to function while on.

What that exact problem is can not be guessed from afar though.

Sorry I couldn&#x27;t be more specific.  I hope this helps a bit.

- Mike

&gt; I apologize up front for this, but it occurred to me some of you 
&gt; electronics nuts might be able to give me a definitive answer about 
a 
&gt; bad purchase I made through Ebay a few months ago.
&gt; 
&gt; My kid desperately wanted this particular phone for his birthday, 
so 
&gt; I 
&gt; bid and &quot;won&quot; it.  Described as brand new, box never opened, yada 
&gt; yada.  It arrived in seemingly perfect condition, and it took about 
a 
&gt; week for us to get it through our pea brains that it wasn&#x27;t holding 
a 
&gt; charge. There was a lot going on around the house, and probably 
&gt; another 
&gt; couple of weeks went by before I decided it just needed a new 
&gt; battery. 
&gt; So I replaced the battery and got a cute little phone case to boot. 
&gt; 
&gt; You might guess that the new battery didn&#x27;t solve the problem.  By 
&gt; this 
&gt; time I had been in contact with the seller, who seemed genuinely 
&gt; sympathetic and suggested I send it back to Cingular/ATT since it 
was 
&gt; still &quot;on warranty&quot; (yeah, right).  Instead, I sent it to an online 
&gt; cellphone repair company that promised they could repair any kind 
of 
&gt; damage for $29.95.  Two weeks later they contacted me and said they 
&gt; were very sorry but the phone had suffered irrepairable water 
damage, 
&gt; and they could dispose of it for me and give me a $15. credit 
towards 
&gt; merchandise or send it back.  I had them send it back, probably 
just 
&gt; to 
&gt; torment myself with the reminder that altogether I wasted close to 
&gt; $350.!!! I just kept digging the hole deeper and deeper..
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, I did contact Ebay and PayPal, but I had waited too long to 
file 
&gt; a 
&gt; formal complaint with either company because I simply couldn&#x27;t get 
it 
&gt; through my head that someone would misrepresent what they were 
&gt; selling.  
&gt; 
&gt; So my question is, IS IT TRUE A WATER-LOGGED CELLPHONE CAN&#x27;T BE 
&gt; FIXED??
