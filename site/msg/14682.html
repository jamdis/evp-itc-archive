We really don't like to cut the power completely when in someone's home bec=
ause it messes up all their clocks, aquariums, and other stuff. The only ti=
me we really do that is of one of the complaints is directly related to the=
 electricity. Then we let them know ahead of time that it is our intention =
to cut the power.

This tapping/EMF thing was something we just discovered.=
 It will suffice if we alert them to it and they can have someone check the=
 electrical system on their own. At any rate, I am sure it is not paranorma=
l issue, and that is all we need.

And yes-this is an attachment condo.

  Yes, I'd guess that some electrical circuit or dev=
ice failure could cause the tapping and EMF spikes, including a bad power m=
eter. Usually these things occur when something is drawing power. Bad wirin=
g or a bad power meter will not show up if everything in the house is turne=
d off or unplugged. Note some equipment like stereos, some microwave ovens,=
 etc. have an active part of the circuit even when when they seem to be off=
. A bad transformer in a stereo could cause the problem too. When I worked =
in an electronics repair shop, we had a lot of those come in for repair.

 =
 When a group I'm in does home investigations, we try to spend part of the =
time with the power completely shut off. That way we can be reasonably sure=
 that any EMF spikes on the meter or strange popping sounds etc. aren't com=
ing from the house wiring or equipment. It would probably be useless if not=
 impossible to try this in an apartment if it is surrounded by other apartm=
ents.

  If the problem is persistent you can try to track it down by unplu=
gging everything in the house one at a time and see if it goes away when a =
particular thing is unplugged.

      Not likely a faulty breaker but it=
 could be. In the winter electrical devices that heat, such as heat tape an=
d heaters, can do that. It could also be some other faulty electrical devic=
e. It could be a bad wiring connection or even a bad power meter (I had tha=
t happen last winter).

      Those touch lamps usually use some sort of CM=
OS IC or MOSFET device that is sensitive to capacitance. Touching the base =
adds capacitance that they sense and switch as a result. Those devices have=
 a lifetime of maybe 5 to 10 years from my experience and start switching o=
n their own at random.

 Hi All,

        Is there someone here that can answer and electrical ques=
tion for me?

        During the case that I recorded those possible EVP's-=
there was a loud tapping noise that seemed to come from the 2nd bedroom. Up=
on checking my logs, every time one of  these clicks were heard, there woul=
d be an EMF spike in the livingroom. The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the livin=
groom downstairs. The home owners have also reported that they have a touch=
 lamp that comes on all the time by itself and the lights in the Kitchen wi=
ll dim occasionally.

        Now these taps are not consistent in timing, =
loudness or rhythm. Could this be the work of faulty breakers?

        Tha=
nks!
        April
