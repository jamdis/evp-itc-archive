&gt; I know what you mean. I just had to return a pedometer for lack of doing 
&gt; research first. The stupid thing kept resetting itself throughout the day. I 
&gt; looked up reveiews because it was doing that to me, and it turns out that was a 
&gt; common problem with that brand.
&gt; 
&gt; With bigger purchases I do research first, not after like the pedometer. Lol!
