I asked about a cord for \nthat yesterday when I was there and bought the 20-125 I am working on.\n\nThey said no, there was nothing that would do that.  I am going to go \nback and talk to someone else now!  Thank you very much.\n\nI have audacity on my computer, just haven&#39;t used it yet.  So if I \nuse that, I don&#39;t even really need a patch cord?  Just the mic?\nI am VERY new to this....can&#39;t you tell?  ;)\n\n~ Laura\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Laura.  There&#39;s a patch cord available from radio shack for \nabout $5.  You connect one \n&gt; end to the ear jack of the recorder and the other to the &#39;sound in&#39; \non the computer.  I use \n&gt; a freeware program called Audacity to record.  Just play the file \ninto the computer (rather \n&gt; than doing an actual transfer).  Hope this helps some.\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret"}
