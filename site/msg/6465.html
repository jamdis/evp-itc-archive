Sorry to bug you guys but I got zero reply to this email from a few days ago.  I acknowleged that working on one word is a triffle but at this early stage of my testing it would be really important to me have someone else confirm...or not...what I think I hear.  This one word recording is also found in my files.   Thanks   Ron L  
Note: forwarded message attached.

I wish you had a folder with your files (and this one uploaded into 
it, too), as I do not get the e-mails due to there being too many of 
them. Thus, I cannot hear your recording.

Sorry...

Hoping I can get some help from the group to define the word or 
words. Thanks Ron L
