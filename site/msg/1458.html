This is the sweep board that goes with the newest tuner/audio board. I made 
one change not shown, I&#x27;m using a bargraph display for the tuning voltage 
instead of a meter(I had one in the junk box). So for the newest &quot;proto 
type&quot; there is two schematics, sweep, and the tuner. This system is much 
more complicated than I would like, and it still makes it look like exotic 
technology, it is in fact, just a radio, and the tuning system.

I was curious in setting up this latest sweep board, something changed, I no 
longer could use the pull down resistors to compensate for the DC offset 
from the op amps. I used only one pull down on the RVG pulse amp.

I used the tantalum capacitors in the white noise amp, the advantage being a 
faster start up time. Larger aluminum caps can be used, such as 100uf-16volt 
caps. It takes about 20 seconds for the white noise to come up, and it still 
takes one minute before the VT signals comes on. On the other hand, the 
linear sweep is on as soon as power is turned on, and with this sweep 
version, the triangle is on all the time, so modes can be switched wihtout 
the warm up period.

This is how I spend my hoildays----but boring!


FYI---- Mine!  I don&#x27;t have a usable system to run sessions on, I keep 
giving them away! Besides, I&#x27;d like to keep the first home made AM/FM tuner 
board.
