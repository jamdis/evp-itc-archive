You can for\ninstance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (including\nthe experimenter&#39;s voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, but\nnot cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP match\nwith what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should always\nbe provided along with the edited version.\n\nBut that&#39;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to express, as\nwe should always be able to present our results to a critical public.\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these files.\n&gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that \n&gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the message \n&gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise that \n&gt; don&#39;t belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can&#39;t piece these \n&gt; files together to make something it&#39;s not, so i keep them in true \n&gt; form pretty much to the original.\n\n&gt; -Steve\n\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hey Steve Forgot to ask...how much editing was needed to get this \n&gt; file?
