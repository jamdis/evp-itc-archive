I'm=
 going to have to run this one past my father, being he is a Ham 
Operator =
(KA2RHU) in NJ for anyone who wants to know. I took 5 files 
and played the=
m in a sequence and recorded it, it consists of tone 
frequencies ranging f=
rom 100hz, 250hz, 440hz, 1khz and 10khz. They 
were 5 second clips of each =
and than i ran it through EvpMaker and it 
sounds like morse code, but i ha=
ve to brush up on it to see if it makes 
any sense. Is it possible for them=
 to communicate through morse code? 
I've attached a 30 second clip of the =
example running it through 
EvpMaker. I'll also attach my original tone fil=
e i created.
