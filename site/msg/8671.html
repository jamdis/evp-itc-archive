<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rees.  Try these settings with the Speak Jet Allophones file and ask for Arthur. :0)

Segments: USE CUE LIST / Z-CROSS (both check marked)
Play EVP: CONTINUOUSLY
Speed Control: 106%

It takes some practice getting used to picking out the words, but since you are already 
experienced with radio sweep, I&#x27;m thinking you&#x27;ll get the hang of it right away.

&gt; Thanks Stefan, I appreciate it.  Also tonight I haven&#x27;t had much luck with my RS 469.  I 
going to give the EVPm a shot again.  If you have any pointers please let me know?
&gt;   I haven&#x27;t had much time to play with it.
&gt;    
&gt;   Thanks

&gt;           Hi Rees,
&gt; 
&gt; your question isn&#x27;t stupid - and you&#x27;re not the only one who asked it. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; You need the QuickTime Player to watch Frank&#x27;s cellphone videos.

&gt; &gt; This is probably a stupid question, what type of program can I use to open this file?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks

&gt; &gt; I mounted the &#x27;469 guts on a board, and added a 3 volt regulator to run the RS radio 
off the 12 volt supply. I have the sweep working so far, hopefully tomorrow I can test the 
radio with
&gt; &gt; external sweep to see if it actually works. The frequency display is now useless, so it&#x27;s 
face down, and the power and band buttons will be added to a new front panel. I&#x27;m not 
sure if I want to
&gt; &gt; make this direct out, or make it just like any other box. The audio should be more 
better than anything I&#x27;ve done so for, at least it sounded real good when I was using a 
manual control, but only
&gt; &gt; could tune half the AM or FM bands wihtout the negative tuning voltage component. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The radio playing in the background is just C2C on a regular radio.
