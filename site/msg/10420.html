 Hi All; We have been warned by others from time to time about unbridled b=
ox use, as it supposedly brings in negativity. I don't want to believe that=
, but there are a few cases of people using boxes made by me, as well as th=
e hack radios, and going whacko big time. Its' either all ego--I'm the only=
est one that can use this, or like the more recent example. I don't know if=
 these people were like this to start, or if it's an external influance, bu=
t it's discouraging. There seems to be a similar reaction with systems not =
made by me--so I've been told.
 
 Soooo, maybe burn some white candles, and=
 maybe get a Rosary. My guys talk about the Catholics, and the Purple Princ=
ess has a Catholic connection on the etheric levels, although the church im=
poses too many limits on her. I wouldn't want to go into a state of fear, b=
ut a little protection stuff couldn't hurt. 
 
 Not only do I not have the =
time to mass produce boxes, I'm beginning to think it's not a good idea any=
way.
