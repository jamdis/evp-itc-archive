<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The onlyest Box Number one from 2002. The one that started this mess. The
oldest Frank&#x27;s Box.This box never did work quite right, so I repaired the
random sweep this afternoon, and made a new audio board, not tested yet.
Random works on this box as it&#x27;s dual supply, takes a +12 volt, and a -12
volts. I alwasy wanted this to work, so spent some time on it today. It was
t only box I made a home made printed circuit board for.  This one was
random mode only, since linear sweep was unheard of in 2002.
