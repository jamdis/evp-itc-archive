<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Chris Moon aside, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way you have of knowing.
Especially when predicting something to happen in the future. All you can do
is wait and see if it happens or not.

It&#x27;s even more difficult than telling if one of your friends is lying, which
can be difficult enough sometimes.

&gt; If so, and you are one of them, then you shouldn&#x27;t have to ask that
&gt; question. And if not, then I guess asking doesn&#x27;t help.
