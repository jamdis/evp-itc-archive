The RS Hacks were not designed for the purpose of\n&gt; two way communication, where as the actually boxes were. I think in my\n&gt; opinion that the audio gotten then is just as good as the\n&gt; communication we are getting now (which is just my own thoughts).\n   \n&gt; I think that the more people who&#39;s curiosity gets the better of them\n&gt; to try this form of communication, the stronger the audio becomes!\n   \n&gt;        Juli"}
