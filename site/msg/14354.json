I=\r\nn the &quot;tomorrow let you know&quot; EVP, I do hear something....just can&#39;t be sur=\r\ne that it is a voice. I does have a cadence similar to someone speaking, bu=\r\nt it could just as easily be something present in the environment-a natural=\r\n background noise. There is no way for me to tell for certain as it is just=\r\n too feint. I can&#39;t make out any clear words. Sure-I could probably matrix =\r\nsome in, but that is all it would be. For an EVP to be considered proof pos=\r\nitive of spirit communication by the community at large, it has to be clear=\r\n enough that many people hear the same thing, without hints or coaxing. If =\r\nyou have to have high quality devices to make it out, it just isn&#39;t good en=\r\nough. That does not mean it isn&#39;t a true EVP, just that it isn&#39;t good enoug=\r\nh to stand as evidence. As for the whistle, it sounded like feedback to me =\r\nas well, but I will have to take you word for it that you were no where nea=\r\nr any other electronics or EMF&#39;s that could contribute to feedback. Even so=\r\n, if I am trying to remain unbiased and objective, there is no way for me t=\r\no say this is a spirit, without personally being with you when you caught i=\r\nt. The only thing I can still say about it is could be, but for me it is no=\r\nn conclusive. If someone does not hear what you are hearing, try to remain =\r\nobjective and just understand that it isn&#39;t personal. You have to understan=\r\nd that with just these recordings alone, there is no way to scientifically =\r\nprove what you have recorded is spirit communication. If you could get cons=\r\nistent, intelligent question and answer recordings, then you would be alot =\r\ncloser. Here again, we are back to the &quot;So what?&quot; thing. You don&#39;t HAVE to =\r\nprove anything scientifically, unless you want others to completely believe=\r\n in your evidence. The theory that is being kicked around is that some EVP&#39;=\r\ns are personal, and only meant for the person recording them to hear.

If you ca=\r\nn&#39;t hear them then it must be either mechanical (sound card or headphones)o=\r\nr maybe your hearing has loss in those frequencies....Some of these are not=\r\n very clear or loud enough too. But many will depend on your computer sound=\r\n card & your headphones. I have let an older man listen (in his late 60&#39;s) =\r\nand he has heard most all of the audio. Same with a few guys at work. Some =\r\nhear them right away, and others can&#39;t until I loop the actually EVP for a =\r\nfew tries. I personally use a Dell Latitude D430 to hear these.

The co=\r\nnversion to MP3 has also caused some loss, but I am still able to hear them=\r\n when I review from this site (but I have the repetive hearing syndrome in =\r\nthis area no doubt). Although I do have some disbelief (shock) that a few o=\r\nf these are not discernable.

I would rather hear someone say &quot;I&quot; m=\r\nade the whistle....that would be more understandable.

You \n  don&#39;t HAVE to prove anything scien=\r\ntifically, unless you want others to \n  completely believe in your evidence=\r\n.

On a HA=\r\nPPIER NOTE :) I was lucky enough to catch \n  the RR-DR60 taking a nap yeste=\r\nrday...&lt;WBR&gt;.it missed a few evp&#39;s real close \n  together (in a 5 second cl=\r\nip) the Sony ICD-B7 heard a male use a different \n  number than what I used=\r\n. I said 16 (my earlier age I was saying in recorder) \n  and the male evp s=\r\naid 13....then a female laughs. All this was missed by the \n  DR60 (except =\r\nmy 16 was recorded in both recorders) BUT then the DR60 &quot;caught&quot; \n  the B7 =\r\n&quot;napping&quot; at near the end of the 5 second clip....the DR60 heard &quot;let \n  me=\r\n out&quot; in a clear (quite) males voice. So this is very promising piece of \n =\r\n evidence for me. **those 2 recordings have been uploaded to my folder. I w=\r\nill \n  include an Olympus W-10 (soon as arrives), Panasonic RR-US360 (when =\r\nI think to \n  grab it) and my RR-QR80 to go with my RR-QR100, and one more =\r\n(can&#39;t remember \n  what brand-model of this last---due to arrive) LOL. I ne=\r\ned to build a multiple \n  mounting devise to aid in putting these into tand=\r\nem service. Then I think I \n  will use my Olympus DS-50 as my &quot;Control&quot; rec=\r\norder....&lt;WBR&gt;by using it on the \n  HQ settings.
