<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well I guess I am really directing this to Frank since he recently said that people that go to grave yards have some &quot;hollywoodistic&quot; type of &quot;lost&quot; mind set :) And I did kind of &quot;hint&quot; that the Boxes are BS (they don&#x27;t work for me) but my words were more a of a PLAY on anothers &quot;emotion&quot; (his) so he would feel singled out....as he did when he put a LABEL on the people that &quot;do&quot; go to grave yards. And to call me &quot;another seriouse researcher&quot; is just plain argumentive, as it seems to look like that is his only way to express himself.....As for going to a &quot;moldy dark besement next&quot; I do recall that is where HE said he does his research :) Sheeesh......--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:

&gt;  So you&#x27;re saying the boxes are BS, and one has to use the &quot;pure&quot; methods?
&gt; Maybe you should try some moldy dark besement next. Sheeesh, yet another
&gt; &quot;serious researcher&quot;!

&gt; &gt; I for one am new at this...but doesn&#x27;t mean I take this field very lightly.
&gt; &gt; I have recorded once (so far) in a Cemetery...and I took the whole idea
&gt; &gt; &quot;seriously&quot;, and with RESPECT. I can say for a FACT--that the voices I
&gt; &gt; receive are &quot;genuine&quot; and not audible before playback...that to me is more
&gt; &gt; desirable (and credible) than some that take &quot;bits and pieces&quot; of a radio
&gt; &gt; program to try and place the information into a &quot;question&quot; or &quot;answer&quot; then
&gt; &gt; try and sell (my unique) way of reaching the unseen. And for the 2 weeks
&gt; &gt; that I have been doing this...I seem to have gotten some amazing results
&gt; &gt; with my &quot;recorder&quot; type technique. I am getting playful spirits, sadness,
&gt; &gt; needy voices, anger, laughter, my first name spoken, possibly contacted my
&gt; &gt; mother twice (unless is a trickster spirit)...so to say &quot;someone&quot; does this
&gt; &gt; in a form (that others don&#x27;t approve)?? None of us are experts yet...so we
&gt; &gt; will look for ANYTHING to try and find the correct &quot;angle&quot; that works for us
&gt; &gt; :) Even if it includes an old Cemetery or working off the &quot;Broadcast Band
&gt; &gt; Radio Waves&quot; to shack up some type of sentence. I don&#x27;t know...who has more
&gt; &gt; &quot;throw away&quot; audio?? I know ALL of my EVP is &quot;unique&quot;.....I for one have
&gt; &gt; tried the &quot;radio&quot; type of EVP. I tried 2 Shack Mods...no joy here people.
&gt; &gt; For me &quot;I saw it at face value&quot; after just a few minutes. I don&#x27;t mean to
&gt; &gt; offend. But I didn&#x27;t step &quot;first&quot;. Now who can say (for certain) WHO has the
&gt; &gt; better form? What ever gets us closer to ourselves, and our lost FRIEND&#x27;S.
&gt; &gt; That&#x27;s ALL that matters man :) PS...I am a 46 year old male from Iowa. I
&gt; &gt; have died and went to the tunnel (when I was 18)...was told &quot;not my time to
&gt; &gt; go&quot; by a male voice that echoed (in the darkness). I have seen 3 UFO&#x27;s in V
&gt; &gt; formation (during Heavens Gate) *2nd comet of that year (here in Iowa) I
&gt; &gt; have seen 1 &quot;shadow&quot; person (take 1 step and vanish) touched a ghost (snuck
&gt; &gt; up on it)...got a burn on tip of my finger where I reached out to touch top
&gt; &gt; of it&#x27;s head (entity was small like child). I have developed 1 xray plate
&gt; &gt; with my finger tips to make multiple white spots in the film-over 20 spots
&gt; &gt; (naval medical officer was angry when he saw them) hahaha...he didn&#x27;t know I
&gt; &gt; did it when his back was turned :) Lot&#x27;s of fun out here Guy&#x27;s (and GALS)
&gt; &gt; let&#x27;s try and not point fingers now.....Knowbody should feel like they are
&gt; &gt; singled out here...like I said &quot;none of us &quot;here&quot; have ALL the answers&quot;. So
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m not a total &quot;Newbie&quot;...but I will try a grace yard again someday. And I
&gt; &gt; would hope that people will respect me as well as I...of those IN that Grave
&gt; &gt; Yard. --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;April

&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#x27;s just an assumtption on most &quot;ghost hunters&quot; part that the dead would
&gt; &gt; be where they died, or were burried, a Hollywoodism I think. I record in my
&gt; &gt; basement.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a question, why is it that people are always going to grave yards,
&gt; &gt; why would any spirit or ghost want to hang around in a place of so much
&gt; &gt; sadness, when they&#x27;ve got the whole universe to explore. Why don&#x27;t they go
&gt; &gt; to some fun places?
