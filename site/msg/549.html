okay, i finally figured it out.
  i opened it in audacity and got the "telephone" singing whatever lol and the "come" 
  i could hear those
  but i cant seem to get out anything else
  i am just estatic that i got those two words, i am on the right track WHOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
   
  a trick i forgot to do was amp them lol
  and i figured out that what it was doing was opening the orig then saving the cleaned as another file lol, took me a minute to figure that out lol
  so i just went back and amped it then went back to audacity. lol
  how complicated lol
  ofcourse everyone would like class a evp's with them speaking full sentances?! who wouldnt? but isnt this kinda the point? You cant hear them with your own ears, therefore why should you be able to hear them loud and clear on tape? ! It does happen, but i dont really care what people would say, classx is ok if it means something to me or is important or i believe. Im not einstein so it really doesnt matter if anyone else can make it out lol im not trying to change the world here <yet> lol
  im just so happy that i got those voices out myself. Thanks misty, youll never know!
   
  amy
  btw while i was cleaning this, my daughter came and told me that the water in the bathroom turned itself on and off 3 times......................hummmmm
