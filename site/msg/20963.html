<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Oh, OK.

If you want to use a common ground for the power supply, you must put a (+)
voltage on pin 4 and the same (-) voltage on pin 11. For example, +12v on
pin 4 and -12v on pin 11. The input and output will show zero DC volts with
no input, referenced to the power supply grounds.

If you put a (+) voltage on pin 4 and ground pin 11, the input and output
pins will reference to half that voltage. So if you put +12v on pin 4 and
ground pin 11 with a single power supply voltage, then the output will have
6 volts on it and anything referenced to &quot;ground&quot; on a schematic must
actually be referenced to 6 volts. You would have to use DC blocking
capacitors on the input and output to connect to other circuits.

&gt; Well , I think you didnt understand me . My question was , What must be
&gt; conected to pins 4 and 11 ? What voltage ? ... I didnt know if , for example
&gt; , pin 11 must be conected to 0v (ground level), or to
&gt; -12v , That was the question . (I know perfectly read a datasheet )

&gt; &gt; Rule #1 of being an EE: Always get the data sheet. Most manufacturers
&gt; &gt; have the data sheets available free for download as pdf files these
&gt; &gt; days. Back in the old days we had to request them and wait for several
&gt; &gt; weeks until they arrived in the mail.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You can do a Google search for a part number and it will usually come
&gt; &gt; up with a link for the data sheet unless it&#x27;s a really old, obscure
&gt; &gt; part by a manufacturer that isn&#x27;t around anymore.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hi , i have an important question , is about linear sweep circuit ,
&gt; whith
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; opamp tl074 , the squematic dont say where must be conected the pins 4
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 11 , 11 is - amd 4 + . How is the conection ? ... 11 to -12v or 0 . 4
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; +12 ? .... I tried , and conecting 11 to 0 v , i got a triangular wave
&gt; ,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; but , i couldnt get a apropiate dc level , the minimum level i got was
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; almost 14v , when i tried more low dc level , the wave lose the form ,
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the offset pot didnt go ok , it didnt have any effect in triangular
&gt; wave .
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;

Oh, OK.I you wan o use a common g ound o he powe supply, you mus pu a (+) ol age on pin 4 and he same (-) ol age on pin 11. Fo example, +12 on pin 4 and -12 on pin 11. The inpu and ou pu will show ze o DC ol s wi h no inpu , e e enced o he powe supply g ounds.
I you pu a (+) ol age on pin 4 and g ound pin 11, he inpu and ou pu pins will e e ence o hal ha ol age. So i you pu +12 on pin 4 and g ound pin 11 wi h a single powe supply ol age, hen he ou pu will ha e 6 ol s on i and any hing e e enced o &quot;g ound&quot; on a schema ic mus ac ually be e e enced o 6 ol s. You would ha e o use DC blocking capaci o s on he inpu and ou pu o connec o o he ci cui s.
