I guess the format of this site is the best we can have for sharing this stuff. EVP's are one thing, but info from the real-time gathering seems more plentiful in intelligence we are receiving. I personally was able to get feedback from a deceased loved one on whether they wre ok on the other side and so on by whomever the messenger was. I do get quite disgusted with the ones scrambling to score a carreer in this stuff and the ones who go as far to infiltrate groups with their own team 'plants' to steal info and scoop ideas and so on. You'd be surprised at who they are.
