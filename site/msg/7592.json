The box is fitted with a scan rate adjustment knob (so you \ncan speed it up, or slow it down) and knobs to adjust the range of \nthe band (you can narrow or widen the scanning).  \n\nThe issue is if this will work effectively or not, as the audio may \nbe more clear, but am I missing a ton of messages in between?  Am I \ngetting combinations of undesirable disc jockey verbage, etc?  \n\nNot sure, yet, so I am experimenting with it some more.  If it does \nnot prove, out then I will look to go with an incremental sweep. :)\n\nLC\nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Super clear Chuck.
