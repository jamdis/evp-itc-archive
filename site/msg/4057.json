It \nwas easy to do, and I instantly plugged it into my Olympus voice \nrecorder and recorded off of it easily.  Now I want to pipe some \nwhite noise in (and ambient), as well. \n\n1) Is the set-up in your video what has worked best for you (with the \ncomputer and all)?\n2) Will you tell us what free computer programs you used (I think one \nis Audacity)?\n3) What microphone and white noise generator did you use for your \ntravel pack unit pictured on UFOGeek.com (posted on December 8th)?  \nAnd can you give me a layout for the wiring of it - you know, how it \nall hooks together?  I&#39;ll figure it out sooner or later, but I&#39;d \nrather it be sooner!\n\nThanks, LC\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am currently putting together another video, just like my others \n&gt; showing a very practical way to use the Radio Shack Hack devices.\n&gt; You probably saw my 12-469 practical use videos, now I&#39;m going to \nbe \n&gt; sharing a 12-470 practical use video.  This one is of a totally \n&gt; portable system that uses a noise generator, the hacked 12-470, a \n&gt; digital (or analog) recorder, and a microphone which gathers the \nraw \n&gt; audio sweep, white noise (or in my case a special white/pink noise \nfile \n&gt; I created), and any ambient noise within a chamber.. and places \nthat \n&gt; session int a .wav file.  It also includes an ear piece so you can \n&gt; hear, real time, what the digital recorder is recording (the mixer \nof \n&gt; the session sound within the chamber).\n&gt; Stay tuned for that video later today....\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; All my Radio Shack Hack videos can be found at\n&gt; http://www.ufogeek.com\n&gt;"}
