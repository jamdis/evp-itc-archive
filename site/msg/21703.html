From what I got from David the T. says, that we are now getting only  
cert=
ain spirits, I can't get the same amount of spirit people as I use to, and =
 
Steve's spirit people are different now from mine, I am not getting near =
the  
same amount of people here now.  But, as a result I can hear them bet=
ter,  
kind of like talking on the phone, and the same for every one of us,=
 some 
how we  are being separated, example would be we each get 20 primary=
 spirits 
to come  through to each of us, that is not the exact amount, jus=
t example, I 
have  noticed fewer voice's coming through over FM from what =
I use to get.  
 Probably the reason Steve's file was very clear too, he ha=
d some of the 
same  people I use to get over here, but I haven't heard fro=
m them in a long 
while,  they were saying my name, even insulting my house=
, lol as usual.  I 
can't  get them here anymore, because "they are blocked=
"  but it seems Steve 
does  now.  Anyway, we should all start getting clea=
rer voices coming 
through as  a result.  sf

Any news on the Bill yet? Hope he comes back around soon--he's a great=
  
tech. I imagine he is quite in demand over there!
