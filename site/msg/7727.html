<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>There is a way to add in the foundation sound in the electronics. In 
#4 I had a square wave generator with variable frequency, that sound 
was mixed in with the radio audio and seemed to produce 
louder/longer/clearer voices. I put this function in #24, and 24 
works the best out of the systems that used the LA1816 chip for a 
radio. I don&#x27;t get that much time to play actually use this stuff.
 
 A square wave is preferred because the output contains all 
harmonics. The circuits are simple, and can easily be made on 
breadboard, or perf board from Radio shack. The mixer is a very 
simple circuit as well, or sound mixers can be purchased. 

 It was with these boxes, and one that I had tried to use a shield on 
thre tuner module, creating RF interference, that produced the 
clearest, and longest messages. 

 I suggest people really interested in advancing the research go get 
a book on basic electronics instead of constantly trying to re-invent 
the wheel. I&#x27;m not saying mechanical methods are a &quot;re-invention&quot;, 
you just have to have a way to interface it to spirit, and I think 
that takes electricity/electronics.
