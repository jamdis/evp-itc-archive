That is so very true! I feel the same way!

C2C has really declined under Noory. I don't dislike him=
, but he is no Art Bell. Art was a legend, but Noory is a tad too narcissis=
tic for my taste, always seeking validation from guests that he has some su=
perintuitive skill. Back in the Bell days, I usually listened most every ni=
ght, because the guests were thought provoking and his interviewing style m=
ade the shows legendary. Noory unfortunately can have a brilliant guest lin=
eup and still make the show a snoozer. 

I am rambling on, but I thought th=
e segment was a good one, if not long enough. Hell they could have devoted =
the whole show to you and Bill and I would have been happy.
