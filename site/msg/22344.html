&gt; Well, you&#x27;ve changed from director to co-founder now.
&gt; 
&gt; But, even that is not true. Other than some random youtube and forum posts mistakenly making that claim, no authoritative website, no mainline news outlet, not even the JREF itself, says Alvarez was on the staff of the JREF.
&gt; 
&gt; Don&#x27;t believe everything you read on the internet. Research!
&gt; The truth is out there!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The group was infiltrated by Jose Alvarez... An illegal alien who was director of the JREF... He has been arrested by the FBI for fraud and identity theft... You can google. For more on the scandal !!!
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; If by JREF you mean the James Randi Educational Foundation, I googled, and Jose Alvarez was never a JREF director.
