<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics by Hugh Everett III
threw a whole new spin on that.

To put it very simply, the universe is the sum of the observations of
everyone in it. The Schrodinger wave equation never collapses. Schrodinger&#x27;s
cat has been dead for some time.

&gt; I have been silent out of fear. Sometimes the ridicule gets hard to take. I
&gt; know that sometimes mind does influence perception of reality. The other day
&gt; I was brought back to quantum physics. They talk of an observer and how just
&gt; the observer being there can change things. I was thinking it is like when I
&gt; sing. I sing much better when I am alone than when I think someone can hear
&gt; me.
