Help sounds great .. e-mail me \nwhen you have free time ..\n\nDebbie\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Cool Debbie, a bit like Sonia Rinaldi does especially if your using \na duo phone line. You can record straight into the pc too if you hook \nit up right. I tested that out a few times and I had results. Nobody \nis up at 2am to test with me tho LOL so I set it aside. Still have \nall the hookups tho.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   And so very nice to offer it free!!! It&#39;s nice to see some of us \nknow the meaning of &quot;share&quot;.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I&#39;ll be gettin vacation soon so if ya need some help testing give \nme a holler.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; misujoey &lt;Debbie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           I&#39;m testing out the &quot;MiniBox&quot; connected to telephones so \nthat others \n&gt; that don&#39;t have a &quot;Mini&quot; can record with me and try to connect with \n&gt; their loved ones in Heaven. I&#39;ve been calling myself to practice \n&gt; (lol) .. It seems like it has potential and I&#39;m working on clarity \nand \n&gt; longer messages. You can listen to my first recording in the file \n&gt; marked Debbie&#39;s recordings/MiniBox/Messages via Telephone.\n&gt; \n&gt; Debbie\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                          \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Looking for last minute shopping deals?
