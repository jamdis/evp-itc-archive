I have found quite a few voices that I wouldn&#39;t have noticed hadn&#39;t I first heard a &quot;pop&quot; sound. Actually had to do some MAJOR enhancing on 2 of them to even hear them at all. I mean one was impossibly buried in the noise. But after slowing it down I got a &quot;wiff&quot; of it, and through more passes of the Audacity effects I was rewarded with a female voice. It was sad though...she said in a mechanical pattern &quot;can - you - help- me.........please - help. Still, the audio is so painfully low. Hearing her plea will forever effect me. Hopefully I can find someoneone here that can hear them as well as I. That can verify this for me :) I hear it...but is nice to know someone else is there with you :) I went back to that location little over an hour later (after found the voice) Is under 1 mile from me. It&#39;s a real sad thing to hear and not knowing what to do.Jim H\n&gt;"}
