We had\nan EVP group in Cologne where I lived at that time. I&#39;ve written some\nwords about the development of the &quot;chopping method&quot; on my EVP pages:\nhttp://www.tonbandstimmen.de/sprach_e.htm\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Yes, i&#39;m messing around with that now.  Seems like you covered all \n&gt; bases with this little program.  What made you build this program?  How \n&gt; did you get started with EVP?\n\n&gt; -Steve H.\n\n\n\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi Steve,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; [...] You and Frank are definitely on to something with these \n&gt; methods,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; so what&#39;s next? Is there an EVP Maker part 2 in the works with echo?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; There&#39;s an echo function in EVPmaker, but it&#39;s not a &quot;live&quot; echo,\n&gt;&gt; it can only be applied to the source audio file between playbacks.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Stefan\n&gt;&gt;"}
