Yeah some of these are almost like it&#39;s not using the radio \nsounds, or using it so completely normal radio stations can&#39;t be \nheard. \n\n Frank-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dead.science&quot; &lt;dead.science@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; -I hear the clay earth part and I think I hear the go back. \n&gt; I looked at clip in Audition and it is strange.  The loud portion or\n&gt; possible fragment is just over three times longer than any other\n&gt; portion of the clip.  This means it is either very very broad band \nor\n&gt; a very powerful transmission.  It is way to long in duration to be\n&gt; broadband.  The FCC would never let a signal this wide be \nbroadcast. \n&gt; And if its that powerful to saturate the front end of the receiver \nit\n&gt; would 1, be very close to you and 2, be heard all the time!  I think\n&gt; the fact that the time period of the signal is so much longer than\n&gt; that of the scan rate proves this is something else.\n&gt; I use this method on my minibox and it seems to be holding up.\n&gt; Rob.\n&gt; Deadscience.com\n&gt; -- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  This is kinda light blasted by the sunlight, but it&#39;s direct \nmode,\n&gt; no sound chamber, and using the lool antenna.
