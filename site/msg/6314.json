I bought it and hacked it at the table at the pizza place at \n&gt; lunch, it took like 3 minutes to do.  If anybody is interested than \n&gt; send me a private e-mail and i will explain further.  I&#39;m 2 for 2 \nwith \n&gt; my efforts so far in duplicating the original idea by Sum, maybe i&#39;ve \n&gt; been put on this path by them ????\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanx Guys,\n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
