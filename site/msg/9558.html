Nathan, I am amazed yo=

a spirit tells me I am holding a carving in my hand, who would even know I =
turned the radio on? Only my wife knows I record, and we have kept this res=

Hi Nathan. I always look to relevance as a key in determining whethe=
r or not something is appropriate to the session. If this were a hoax, I wo=
uld then have to seek an explanation for how private information is known b=
y the 'hoax perp', particularly information that would require visual aware=
ness. Some of us have examples of appropriate responses being given when as=
king things like, "Can you name something nearby me?" or "Please tell me wh=
at I'm holding in my left hand." A sophisticated multi-transmission two way=
 radio would not explain answers which require 'visual' information of some=
 kind (though I'll be the first to admit my understanding of electronics is=
 limited but I'm fairly confident on this aspect.) Of course, there is alwa=
ys the chance that the person running the hoax is also, or in partnership w=
ith, an extremely talented remote viewer or psychic who is able to glean th=
at visual information from the ether or the mind of the experimenter. And w=
hat of those examples where people have confirmed the sound of the voice be=
ing "just like" that of their loved one in spirit? Surely the hoaxer isn't =
also able to mimic people's loved ones.If you are using EVP Maker with anyt=
hing other than the allophones file, which contains no words to begin with,=
 you are also running the possibility of 'false positives' albeit they woul=
dn't be from a hoax. Again, I look to relevance to be key, and relevant inf=
o that would not come easily to a stranger is even better. For example, I t=
urned on my MiniBox for the very first time and said, "Hello?" and immediat=
ely received the response, "Hello Margaret." If this were a hoax, how could=
 that person know in less than 10 seconds, who I was by name. I had not giv=
en this information out. Not to mention that you have people experimenting =
24/7 and receiving similar responses. How in the world could an organizatio=
n have the manpower, technology, or even the desire, to attempt such a hoax=
? I mean that as a genuine inquiry, because there might be an explanation I=
 have not thought of. I have one example where, via radio sweep, my communi=
cator was able to correctly identify the status and location of a missing p=
erson (who it turns out was alive and well, so we ended up with confirmatio=
n that the info given had indeed been correct - which is much less complica=
ted that trying to track and understand the clues when associated with the =
dead, or missing but not found.) Again, if a hoax, would that have simply b=
een a lucky guess on the part of the hoaxer?Bottom line for me is ... have =
I wondered if it could be a hoax? Or simply a fortuitous tuning of the dial=
? Yes, on both accounts. But there is enough compelling evidence to rule ou=
t both of them as an explanation for the far too many relevant examples rec=
eived by so many of us.Good food for thought, but after digesting it, I'd h=
ave to say, "No, a sophisticated hoax does not sufficiently explain the phe=
nomena on a large scale."Margaret--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Nathan Sha=
