I use x-bass speakers hooked up thru an equalizer to my pc so what I h=\r\near isnt always what others hear on thier systems. I am more surprised when=\r\n they hear it the same as I do. When I listen to some voices on another spe=\r\naker setup sometimes the voices tones are lost and cant hear anything, whil=\r\ne others voice are well recieved on any setup. I am unsure why, nor am I su=\r\nre why some days they come in clearer than others.\n\nAs you requested heres =\r\na couple more water files from a recent session that I found to be very cle=\r\nar. I was discussing Otto and his &quot;replacement&quot; with them that week as well=\r\n as running some experiments redoing a few audio/visual tests I&#39;d done in t=\r\nhe past.\n\nThe session from the next day I was saying hello to my friends wh=\r\no have passed and asked they wish my mother a happy birthday for me that da=\r\ny. My birthday is a couple weeks away from hers so this year I guess its a =\r\nhappy birthday early (I can kinda hear early on the end of that one how abo=\r\nut you?)\n \nMisty\n\n\n--- On Tue, 8/12/08, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n\n&gt; From: Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] A few=\r\n recent captures\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, August 12, =\r\n2008, 7:44 PM\n&gt; Misty, heard pretty much of what you did.=A0 A few words no=\r\nt\n&gt; clear.=A0 I found the water method surprisingly clear.=A0 Full\n&gt; senten=\r\nce, same tone for all words.=A0 Like to hear more.=A0\n&gt; Ron\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Mon=\r\n, 8/11/08, Misty Dawn\n&gt; &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Misty Daw=\r\nn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] A few recent captures\n&gt; To: =\r\nEVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Monday, August 11, 2008, 10:33 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Most of these are very clear for my ears how about you?\n&gt; \n&gt; Not=\r\nes*\n&gt; \n&gt; I wish I could build robotics too LOL but dont think so in\n&gt; this =\r\nlifetime.
