<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>In the history of EVP/ITC, it has been acknowledged by some 
researchers that the first people to have recorded &quot;voice phenomena&quot; 
via magnetic means (i.e. a magnetophone) were the Catholic priests 
Fathers Gemilli and Ernetti back in 1952. (Gemelli received a message 
from his departed father while he and Ernetti were working with 
Gregorian chants). This communication bothered them so they had an 
audience with Pope Pius XII who was quoted as saying: &quot;Dear Father 
Gemelli, you really need not worry about this. The existence of this 
voice is strictly a scientific fact and has nothing whatsoever to do 
with spiritism. The recorder is totally objective. It receives and 
records only sound waves from wherever they come. This experiment may 
perhaps become the cornerstone for a building for scientific studies 
which will strengthen people&#x27;s faith in a hereafter.&quot;

In addition - Friedrich Jurgenson was a very well-known figure to 
both Pope Pius XII (who commissioned Jurgenson to paint numerous 
portraits of him and allowed Jurgenson to do archeologic explorations 
of the ruins of Pompeii) and to Pope Paul VI (who also commissioned 
Jurgenson to paint portraits of him and to produce a documentary for 
him which resulted in Jurgenson receiving the Order of Commendatore 
Gregorio Magno). It is alleged that Jurgenson discussed his &quot;voice 
phenomena&quot; recordings with Pope Paul and that the pope never spoke of 
reservations about the technique but I haven&#x27;t found any definite 
proof of those conversations. You would think, though, that Pope Paul 
had to have known about Jurgenson&#x27;s &quot;voice phenomena&quot; work either 
from first-hand talks to Jurgenson or indirectly via Vatican staff 
members and would have spoken to Jurgenson about any reservations he 
had. Note that Jurgenson&#x27;s recording work occurred from late 1959 
until his death in 1987.

&gt; Hey Mike, tell your Catholic friend that the Vatican, under John 
Paul approved experimentation with ITC. There are several Vatican 
priests who experiment with direct radio voice ITC.zammit

&gt; Roman Catholics were
&gt; given the Church&#x27;s blessing yesterday to &quot;contact&quot; loved ones beyond
&gt; the grave. Leading Vatican theologian Father
&gt; Gino Concetti said it is no longer a sin, as long as mediums, 
fortune teller
&gt; and palmists are not involved.
&gt; The pronouncement
&gt; came after Italian magazine claims that contact with the spiritual 
world had
&gt; produced miracles. Father Concetti dismissed that,  but added: &#x27;We 
can
&gt; pray for our loved ones. They will respond in dreams and 
inspiration. In one
&gt; example, a grandmother advised a girl about her marriage choice in 
a dream. The
&gt; girl did not heed counsel and a grave problem developed. If we pray 
seriously
&gt; in a quiet place, with our hearts and our voices, the departed will 
express
&gt; themselves and advise us.&#x27;

&gt; Mail, 29-Nov-96)

&gt; Recently Father
&gt; Concetti, one of the most competent theologians in the Vatican, 
said in an interview:
&gt; &#x27;According to the
&gt; modern catechism, God allows our dear departed persons who live in 
an ultra -
&gt; terrestrial dimension, to send messages to guide us in certain 
difficult
&gt; moments of our lives. The Church has decided not to forbid anymore 
the dialogue
&gt; with the deceased with the condition that these contacts are 
carried out with a
&gt; serious religious and scientific purpose.&#x27;

&gt; The Pope explains to
&gt; us &quot;What actually happens to us at the moment of death?&quot;
&gt; This question has
&gt; occupied mankind for centuries. Jesus promised that a final 
judgment will come,
&gt; an all-last day. But what occurs to the souls of those who die 
before this
&gt; point in time?
&gt; Pope John Paul II
&gt; explained it in Rome
&gt; before pilgrims. He said:
&gt; &#x27;One should not
&gt; think life begins after death only with the final judgment. Quite 
special
&gt; conditions prevail after natural death. It concerns a transitional 
phase in
&gt; which the body dissolves and where the life of a mirror-image 
entity (the soul)
&gt; begins.&#x27;
&gt; &#x27;This entity is
&gt; equipped with its own consciousness and its own will, so that 
humans exist,
&gt; although they no longer possess a physical body.&#x27;
&gt; A member of the
&gt; international papal theological advises: &#x27;At the moment of death 
humans make an
&gt; enormous discovery. The soul does not only leave the body, but 
humans discover
&gt; the secret of time. Because it becomes timeless, steps into 
eternity.&#x27;

&gt; journal Bild, 1998 October 30 in an article, &quot;The moment of death;
&gt; what occurs to our soul?&#x27;)
