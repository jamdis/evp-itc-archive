Sending all 1.5 million of them to him now hehehe. \nJust \n&gt; kiddin. I wouldnt know where to start/end. \n&gt; \n&gt; I did get one evp last night I am excited about tho. Was a nice \ngift. A \n&gt; repeat of my very first evp from my mother, saying exactly what she \n&gt; said how she said it all those years ago. A bit off on her soft \ntone \n&gt; voice but the message was the same. It is loud and clear and was \nusing \n&gt; ST method which she doesnt like to use usually.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was always a bit disheartened that I didnt know what I was doing \nwhen \n&gt; I got that first message and screwed up on saving it before my pc \n&gt; crashed. I didnt think it would ever be recovered completely to how \nI \n&gt; heard it that night. But for this one I saved it right, no pc \ncrashin \n&gt; goin on, and now I am left with a nice repeat today to hold onto.\n&gt; \n&gt; I may post that to the files area in a bit. \n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;misujoey&quot; &lt;Debbie@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Maury Show is asking for Evp&#39;s and Spirit Video and Photos ..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jeffrey Wands, Chris, and I did a quick &quot;How to&quot; segment for \n&gt; &gt; people &quot;new&quot; to the Paranormal World ...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; www.1800heaven.com/aboutme.htm\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Debbie\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
