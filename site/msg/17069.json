Doubting and questioning results can only\n&gt; make a field of research more  solid in the long run.  It helps to divide\n&gt; the weak evidence and methods from the strong.   While everyone is still\n&gt; free to pursue their beliefs, everyone only has so much time and money,  and\n&gt; getting help with determining the best areas to spend that time and money\n&gt; can be a valuable thing.\n&gt;\n&gt; So for anyone doing research, especially their own personal research, who\n&gt; is not wealthy and does not have 100 years left in their lives, being\n&gt; skeptical about one&#39;s results seems not only a necessity, but I don&#39;t think\n&gt; any kind of progress, especially in a difficult area like the paranormal, is\n&gt; even possible without it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; **\n&gt; --- On *Fri, 4/23/10, JANDANACOSTA &lt;jandan108@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: JANDANACOSTA &lt;jandan108@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] nuff said?\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, April 23, 2010, 8:34 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am confused about two issues.

It&#39;s\n&gt; what the skeptics and debunkers tout as the answer to all paranormal\n&gt; experience. I think we ought to pull our claws back in, especially me!\n&gt;\n&gt;  I have gotten &quot;voices&quot; that I thought were perfectly clear, and no one\n&gt; else could hear it, and some I found was just a snippet of music, so yeah,\n&gt; that happens, but it does not eliminate or explain everything from the\n&gt; boxes, and other EVP methods, you  just have to be aware of the possibility.\n&gt; Anotherr problem is broadcast fragments, sometimes they are just what they\n&gt; sound like, an ad for one thing or another, sometimes they can have\n&gt; sychronistic meaning, and sometimes they can be altered in some way to form\n&gt; a messages, such as the recent one I had about learning sex, which was\n&gt; seemingly ignored by all cuz it has the &quot;s&quot; word--I guess. The fragments can\n&gt; also be distorted as the radio tuning is swept across a station, I don&#39;t\n&gt; accept every word and syllable as meaning something. You have tio judge\n&gt; mnessage by content and personal meaning.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I have seen faces stand up in a carpet right in front of me, not something\n&gt; I just happened across, something that happened live as I watched. For\n&gt; someone to suggest that&#39;s imagination I find very offensive.\n&gt;\n&gt;  When I first switched to a linear sweep in the boxes, I could hear nothing\n&gt; but gibberish, then suddenly I could hear &quot;them&quot; speaking. I doubt that is\n&gt; all imagination either, I think the mind(which is not brain) has to\n&gt; reprogram the ears, which are brain, to hear.  I also think the skeptics can\n&gt; not allow this programming to take place, hence they can&#39;t hear. I would be\n&gt; very surprised if any of the hard core skeptics even turned on a box for\n&gt; fear that they may hear something that&#39;s not there. Rorke(the Phd) implied\n&gt; as much when he wanted a box to test, or more like debunk.
