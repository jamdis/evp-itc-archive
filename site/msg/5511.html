I hope all of you on this group realise that my personality for all 
it's faults is one of overbearing. Believe me hit has gotten me into 
some tight situations in the past, but has also served me well in some 
situations.

Be that as it may, I would like to let everyone here know that when I 
offer advice or an answer to a question and it seems like an order or 
condicending attitude, That is not my inttention. There are many more 
people that have been here longer than me and have more experience 
maybe I should learn when and how to be a bit more humble.

If I have offended anyone please accept my appologies.

Bruce
