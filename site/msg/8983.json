I have posted in my files at Ronriko.  In one file I clearly hear the name R LEDERER.  It is unmistaken because most of my family can&#39;t even pronounce my last name correctly (but not the German pronunciation).    What is also interesting is the name came after I asked who is there to speak to me and before I asked them to say my name.  I do have at least two relatives on the other side with the same first initial as mine.  Interesting that they said R and not Ron.  This answer was heard a little more than half way into the file but I have posted more hoping someone hears more and can let me know.  That goes with the other files I have posted.  \n   \n  One other file posted, I hear ....I WILL SAVE....but I cannot make out what comes before or after.  Two other files have no messages but I am hoping someone will listen and comment.  \n  It&#39;s great to get something I can hear but I am certain I am missing tooooo much.  It&#39;s a start.
