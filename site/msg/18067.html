I must admit I enjoyed the experiment even though none of us got the right answer.  I was thinking about this earlier.  Part of the problem, I think, is that we are dealing with spirits of people.. hopefully... and they have the same limitations I do.  They are just people, so they cannot know everything that is everywhere.  They are not like God who is all seeing and all knowing.  I don't know that we could ever get this answer right.

I still enjoyed doing it though, and I couldn't wait to see what the picture was.  Lol, I didn't think Wed. would ever get here!
