I know, it sounds crazy, but it did use to happen, and it was not\n&gt; a gimmick, Trumpets are made of a hard aluminum pipe light weight long tube,\n&gt; i have a picture of it if you&#39;d like to see it, maybe it&#39;s the same type\n&gt; principle  your using in the box. sf\n&gt;\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Sat, Jul 10, 2010 1:56 pm\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Just the chamber and speaker\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    When I first &quot;got&quot; the idea for the box, using a chamber was poionted\n&gt; out to me kinda telepathicly. It seems to function as a space where the\n&gt; sound can be manipulated easier by the entities, and using different\n&gt; materials seems to get different levels. When I use aluminum, that seems to\n&gt; facilitate ET contact more often than not using the chamber. Using pipe\n&gt; helps make the chambers smaller. Thre seems to be a filtering effect by the\n&gt; chamber that tends to enhance the voices. Most of the boxes I make have an\n&gt; option to use the chambers.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The mind contact that poined out the chamber--I think--was that shadow guy\n&gt; on the group home page.\n&gt;\n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sat, Jul 10, 2010 at 12:30 AM, &lt;SnowfireL@aol.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   Frank, do those pipes lessen the static a bit?
