You might need to convert it to \nmp3, because that will make it a smaller file.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Rees\n&gt; \n&gt; psfponies &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           Hi Rob\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this from a recorder?

I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s real or not...I remember \n&gt; &gt; no one was talking around me at the time...could it have been some \n&gt; &gt; random fabric sound?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If it is real, how likely for someone on the other side to be on an \n&gt; &gt; air plane, and what kind of help would they need?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Rob\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                            \n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
