Check out my newest video, spirit does a great job talking to me,  and 
answering my silly questions, check it out.  One guy in this says, "we  are not 
able to convey, have a heart" it's later in this video, listen  carefully, I 
can even hear my mother, saying my name every so often.   Someone also says 
something about April 5 or 6th, and they also say the word  "comet."  
Yikes!!!  They answer questions about a bird, dog, snow,  spoon, battery's, 
telephone, the TV being fixed, they knew it was in getting  repairs, and one 
fella, says, "you got it fixed."  A guy says, your  Bouvier's, we got em" I use 
to own Bouvier de flanders dogs.  Got to just  love these spirit folk, they 
try so hard to communicate with us.  sf
