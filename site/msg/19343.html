<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Adrea,
have you heard of sleep paralysis? I wonder if sleep paralysis could be caused by leaving astral state too quickly? I had never thought of this as a possible cause but now I wonder.

&gt; Really I haven&#x27;t ever woken up while leaving but when coming back and
&gt; woke up in almost a half awake state feeling trapped because I couldn&#x27;t
&gt; move until I shook it off.
&gt;  
&gt; Well it depends on what you mean about your wife not being gone long
&gt; enough-LOL my hubby can snore really badly and I have had to go in
&gt; another room to sleep. I should have him get that checked though.

&gt;  I read that in one of my Astral books, but have never tried it.
&gt; Everytime I get close, the process of leaving breaks my awareness, and
&gt; I&#x27;m instantly awake. I had started to work on astral projection again
&gt; when the wife was in the hospital, but she wasn&#x27;t in long enough
&gt; (cold!?).

&gt; I had read something about that recently too. If I did astral travel
&gt; last night I don&#x27;t remember it &amp; I did only stay asleep for about  an
&gt; hour at a time. But also when I do astral travel it also leaves me more
&gt; tired than when I went to bed.
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks!

&gt; I thought that was supposed to be good for Astral work, the unsettled
&gt; weather?

&gt; The word quake is made out of noise.
