Thank you, Frank!  There you have it!  The last time I checked, the U.S. of A. was a "Capitalist" country...! That simply means making or buying wholesale a product that will retail for more money than was invested thus making a Profit.  You want an example?  You just have to look at Thomas Edison and Nickola Tesla.  Both were brilliant men,  pioneers in their field,  which was basically the same for both.  One was more brilliant than the other,  in turn the less brilliant "stole" ideas and products from the other.  The most brilliant was not a "Capitalist",  he devoted his time and efforts to "bettering the lives of mankind".  The lessor was indeed a "Capitalist",  his motives were less noble,  however,  and he was willing to "better" mankind,  too,  but make a good profit in the process.  We all know the story...one is foremost in the eyes of the general public,  became personally rich and famous,  while the other died broke and without fanfare.  A shame,  but factual, 
 none-the-less.  Would you work for free?  Would you supply people with something they want without recompense?  I think not.  I certainly wouldn't!  Get real.  Bruce is going to post a capture, he says, from Nickola Tesla.  I predict that it will be a warning... "Don't Do What I Did!  Make a Profit!"    --Rod

           Well...Mean Bitch week was last week, so I was trying to be nice. Yeah, I can make a box for like $50 if it's on perf board, and $100 if it on PCB, the bare board alone is about $46. The only problem I have is the time. It takes two weeks minumum to get a box together and working. Most people would like to get paid for their time. I make about $40 an hour at my real job. ( been here 24 years!) Someday this stuff will get mass produced in China, and be included in every cell phone!

          I realize the time it takes to put things together. Especially units built from the ground up but if you are taking on the duty of spreading the technology to help mankind, to me it would be a labor of love. I can see and accept recovering production costs even, but this guy is looking to make a huge profit. 

You gained your respect and credibility on the fact that you have a system that works and you are willing to give it away when you didn't have to Frank. This guy is coming out of the gate with a cheap imitation of EVP maker and your system (both of which are free) and putting a huge price tag on it. It just don't sit right with me!

Honestly, I know it is none of my business what Ron does but I guess I just needed to register my protest with this seemingly blatant attempt at exploiting good though naive people.

Regards,

Frank R.

 Interesting. I can see the price for early models. This stuff take tons of time to put together. I don't want to fault anyone ---yet. I couldn't figure out how to sell the things, and keep it honest, but all that does is deny everyone from using it.

          $400 to $650 dollars a unit. This guy is retarded! If he is selling this unit, he doesn't get it Frank!

Yeah, I think this stuff is starting to take off with more users "getting it" and more people out there making different designs.
