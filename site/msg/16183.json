Living people perceive the sounds and may in fact alter the nature of the recordings. \n\nPK is the ability to modify the environment with the mind. It is as reasonable to presume that living people are the center of the effect as to presume discarnate entities are controlling things.\n\nIt may be true that the living person is influenced by external sources, among which could of course be discarnates of some type.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mrscaptainjack2&quot; &lt;jjkamp@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry, I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s that my brain isn&#39;t working today or what, but I&#39;m having trouble following your statement below.  Do you mean that living people unconsciously manipulate the box, and the entities telepathically dictate how we manipulate the box?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jill\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;phenom_investigator&quot; &lt;phenom_investigator@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If we presume that much of what is heard is in fact the result of personal PK and not a discarnate voice, we may have an answer to the question of why some sourcse communicate and others do not.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would suggest that while the operator may produce the voice phenomena, that operator may indeed be influenced by external agents. This could include discarnate agents. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When you carefully consider what is being heard, the themes often seem to reflect what may be subconscious concerns of the operator or the listener. If external sources additionally inform this process of perception, it is quite possible they influence both what is  recorded and how is later perceived. This would also nicely explain why some people hear the same things on a recording while others hear quite different things and more importantly while one person hears different things from the same recording at different times.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It would also remove the requirement that discarnates manifest the phenomena. If discarnates are indeed non-physical, it is unclear how they would modify the physical world. On the other hand, we have good evidence demonstrating the ability of living individuals to alter their environments in profound ways, apparently with their minds. So it seems to make more sense that this might indeed by the underlying mechanism to EVPs rather than discarnate manipulations.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mrscaptainjack2&quot; &lt;jjkamp@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m wondering if a haunting-type situation such as yours would be different from talking to your ancestors four or five generations back?  I guess I&#39;m just wondering out loud what makes us connect with some entities, no matter how obscure or nonexistent the connection, and not others?  What makes some &quot;tune in&quot; to talk to us, or hang around on a plane closest to us...or what?  At least in a haunting, you&#39;d be getting the entity that happened to reside at that location.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Never mind me, guys.
