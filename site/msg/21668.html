Well, I have  some info from the peanut =

many of you guys won't understand it,  s=
igning type angel files, I didn't 
want to  believe how a mother could kill=
 her own child,  but it seems she did 
the deed.  Seems from  what the ange=
ls say, the grandma and mom Casey  got 
into a fight, Casey was mad so when=
 the  parents were gone, she put the baby 
into the  truck, and closed the =
lid, she may have been  tied so she couldn't 
get out and or  druged.  In o=
ne of the files, you can hear  Caylee crying 
for her mama, she stills asks=
 for  her mother, and the angels are saying, that 
 "Christ holds the baby"=
  I have lots of  files now, there are but a few.  
I think  the spirit say=
, her mother will "get  life." sf
