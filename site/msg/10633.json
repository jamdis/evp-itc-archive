ANOTHER one out there now)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; OMGosh.  It took me forever to figure out how to do everything to create my YouTube \nvideo, \n&gt; but I finally got it all together and posted.  I&#39;ve never done anything of this nature \nbefore. \n&gt; LOL - sometimes I can be a wee bit on the technologically challenged side!  ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.youtube. com/watch? v=Dmlox_8H5lo\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope you enjoy it if you decide to watch.  I figured another video promoting the \nPOSITIVE \n&gt; side to spirit communication would help counterbalance some of the garbage out there. \n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       \n____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and \n&gt; know-it-all with Yahoo!
