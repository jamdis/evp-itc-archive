That would be sweet. I say since they are sooo in demand, you should be mak=
ing some money on them. This would also help to ensure that people are real=
ly interested in them enough that they would pay for them. If you give them=
 away for free, people will abuse the privilege.

  Sorry Susan, I don't sell the boxes. The ones of mine that are out =
I mostly give away to interested people, but--- I just don't have the time =
to make this stuff on demand, even if I did sell them. 

   However, I am w=
orking with another researhcer to see what we can come with for a kit of so=
rts, or maybe just a low cosr box.
