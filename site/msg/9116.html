Hi Margaret,
 
I am like Bruce in the fact that I have given away radios too.  I am  not 
rich but I gave (4) radios to deserving individuals to help further their  
knowledge and research.  Even if I lost a couple of bucks on the venture I  still 
think it would be worth it for people to know that we are out there and  they 
are not alone when they want to try and get into this research field.   Its 
always nice to know that we are all just an email away.  And I think it  would 
send a message to this guy in New York that there are people out here that  take 
this very seriously and are not in it for the monetary gain but for the  
educational and research end of it.  
 
Jeff

Hi Jeff. Sorry for my blasting you. I still feel that taking a loss on a  
product is not sending 
any meaningful message to the guy, and would only  possibly prevent one sale, 
for every 
unit sold at a loss ... but providing  a listing at a minimal fee (with no 
hassles of money up 
front, going to  the post office, etc.) would work great. 

Again, sorry for being  Devil's Advocate. :-( As I posted to Bruce and 
Jeremy... essentially, 
I am  on the same moral page with the rest of you! 

Margaret
