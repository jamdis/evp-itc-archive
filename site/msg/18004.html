&gt;  I am sorry now that I got involved in this testing, this is not a science
&gt; class, and I am sorry list members, I was unaware of what they were up to.
&gt; no wonder David (the tech) did not want to get involved.  We don&#x27;t know
&gt; who people are on these lists to begin with, and I should have been more
&gt; careful, getting old.  sf

&gt;   Your points are well taken John.  And I agree it is a first attempt and
&gt; certainly can be improved on successive trials, and cannot determine the
&gt; origin of the messages.
&gt;
&gt; For this first experiment/protocol , I thought we would go as generic as
&gt; possible: it doesn&#x27;t matter really here where the information comes from, or
&gt; how different people interpret it: just determine the object in the specific
&gt; timeframe.  We&#x27;ll start with data on how accurate the participants can get,
&gt; however they do it.
&gt;
&gt; As to your comment on the audio files:  originally I considered requiring
&gt; as part of the protocol to include the audio.  Maybe that is still a good
&gt; idea.  The reason I didn&#x27;t, is because people often claim to hear different
&gt; things each time they listen to a file.  Posting a file with an incorrect
&gt; answer, for example, the person may later claim (after the experiment) to
&gt; NOW hear the right answer.  And others may confirm it.
&gt;
&gt; This seemed liked a rabbit hole, and I&#x27;m not sure how to handle it. So for
&gt; this trial, I figured we&#x27;d just not go there, and require replies only be
&gt; valid if they are given during the experiments specified time frame. Once
&gt; the actual object is know, it seems too easy for a person to come up with
&gt; the answer.
&gt;
&gt; But yeah, we need to see how this goes, fix the problems, and come up with
&gt; more of them!

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Since we&#x27;re talking about experiments and protocols here are some ideas
&gt; to improve
&gt; the protocol RJ suggested initially. Using a test target is one way of
&gt; establishing a
&gt; truth in time, which is the basis of this experiment. But there are a
&gt; couple of issues.
&gt;
&gt; It is quite possible that someone could discern the target through remote
&gt; viewing alone.
&gt; This would negate the need for involvement of a spirit communicator or
&gt; discarnate entity.
&gt; Outcomes depend on the word of those reporting. The true skeptic (not
&gt; cynic) would
&gt; therefore say that this experiment contains a basic flaw in that it does
&gt; not uniquely
&gt; indicate that the information was obtained in the prescribed manner.
&gt; Providing access
&gt; to the raw audio file would not necessarily constitute proof either, since
&gt; many of these
&gt; communications can only be heard by certain people,
&gt;
&gt; If the audio file were quite clear, timing  becomes an issue. In other
&gt; words, when was
&gt; the audio actually recorded?  This issue can be mitigated simply by
&gt; requiring any
&gt; claimant to email the audio file to a trusted party before the test ends.
&gt; It would be best
&gt; if the trusted party were not otherwise involved in the experiment and it
&gt; was  their duty
&gt; simply to collect the claims. Once all claims had been collected they could
&gt; be posted
&gt; publicly for review by the community in general.  The experimenter could
&gt; decide if any
&gt; of the claims seemed to have hit, and this decision could be reviewed by
&gt; anyone if desired.
&gt;
&gt; The important detail however is that this experiment does not completely
&gt; answer the
&gt; question. It is a first attempt and certainly can be improved on successive
&gt; trials.
&gt;
&gt; Successive trials are always a good idea, since it provides replication.
&gt; And it would be
&gt; best if others replicated the experiment using a very similar protocol. If
&gt; these were to
&gt; succeed, the community could then state that out of X trials Y had
&gt; succeeded (by
&gt; some definition of success) potentially giving a success rate above that
&gt; expected
&gt; by random chance. This would make the outcome quantifiable and measureable
&gt; and thus meaningful.
&gt;
&gt; But also important to note, this would only prove the potential veracity of
&gt; the messages.
&gt; It would not (and cannot as far as I can tell) prove the origin of the
&gt; messages. This detail
&gt; will, I fear, remain a matter for belief and speculation for quite some
&gt; time to come.

 he p o ocol RJ sugges ed ini ially. Using a es a ge is one 
 way o es ablishing a

 I is qui e possible ha someone could disce n he a ge

 This would nega e he need o in ol emen o a spi i

 Ou comes depend on he wo d o hose epo ing. The ue

 he e o e say ha his expe imen con ains a basic law in ha 
 i  does no uniquely 
 indica e ha he in o ma ion was ob ained in he p esc ibed 
 manne . P o iding access
 o he aw audio ile would no necessa ily cons i u e p oo 
 ei he , since many o hese 
 communica ions can only be hea d by ce ain people, 
  
 I he audio ile we e qui e clea , iming  becomes an 
 issue. In o he wo ds, when was 
 he audio ac ually eco ded?  This issue can be mi iga ed 
 simply by equi ing any

 The impo an de ail howe e is ha his expe imen does no

 Successi e ials a e always a good idea, since i p o ides
