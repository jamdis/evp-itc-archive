Mike, Yeah I pass by the various RS's keeping an eye out for the grey and white 470, I'll find it. The clicking on the 469 isn't too bad but I'd rather not have it. The micro seems to be a nifty Box though. I'm not always able to listen as much as I'd like either but hopefully 2008 will be a breakthrough year for us all. See ya - Bill

 The PC thing to say is.. "I like them all just the same, and use them 
 equally".  Now none of them will get to jealous over another.
 Actually the one I have spent the most time with is the Micro Box, 
 since I keep adding more things to it.
 I do fancy the RSH 12-470 though... it's my favorite... but please 
 don't tell the others.
 It's easy to carry around, has a built in speaker, and does not have 
 that clicking when sweeping.
 Although I have not had the opportunity to use any of them as much as 
 I'd like, but maybe in the coming year I will have more chances to 
 dabble.
 Plus.. I'm sure I'll be adding more things to the Micro Box, as long 
 as there is still room to stuff components and wires.
 
 Happy Holidays!
 - Mike
