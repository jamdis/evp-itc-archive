<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi, all! 

I&#x27;m a newbie to this list, and very excited about what I&#x27;ve been reading the
last week or so.

Briefly, though I am a corporate consultant and exective coach by
profession, I&#x27;ve been a channel since 1971, working with one (wonderful)
guide. I&#x27;ve also done lots of psychic work over the years, had lots of
experiences, and consider the unseen world as &quot;normal&quot; and real as our
so-called ordinary world.

I have wanted for years to try recording voices of my unseen associates, and
am SO excited to begin to experiment, so I thank you all for the invaluable
information I&#x27;m reading on this list so far!

I have some very basic questions, and apologize if they are too simple or
repetitious for the more experienced and regular members of this list.

When some of you are mentioning that your mini-box is on the way, from where
are you buying it? What other systems are available, other than making one
with the Radio Shack radios (which I will experiment with for sure!).

Would it be possible to list the possible other equipment that one might
buy, and the sources? Or is this already available somewhere on the
yahoogroups website for this group?

Thanks in advance to one and all for any help you can give me with this...
there&#x27;s SO much great info here it&#x27;s a bit hard to sort out as a newbie on
the list who just dove in recently!

Cheers,

Leslie (in NYC)
