&gt; I get grumpy, and pissed. I try to share to  information about the 
box, and it&#x27;s the same friggin&#x27; arguement everytime. I&#x27;m just now 
answering e-mails generated from the mistake of leaving a comment on 
a site about how I think most of what passes for paranormal 
knowledge is Hollywood. I can&#x27;t get past that shit, nor can I get 
past the egos, so I give up, they can&#x27;t hear me. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I think the problem is intellect, it takes a certain level to be 
able to comprehend, and use the boxes, to everyone else its&#x27; going 
to look fake, and sound like gibberish.

&gt; Hi All;  I tried to post a couple box video&#x27;s on you tube last 
night, they should come up if you do a search on Ghost Box, Frank&#x27;s 
box, ITC, EVP, or paranormal, or maybe &quot;PurpleAlienGirl&quot; (user 
name). It&#x27;s my first attempt, so I&#x27;m not sure if it worked, and it&#x27;s 
blocked here at work.  BTW, I&#x27;m not sure if the Purple Princess 
stuff puts people off, that&#x27;s who my guys say I am, and I accept 
that as an axiom. As if it matters, but that&#x27;s an &quot;other level&quot; 
identity, and has little to do with physical conditions. Purple is a 
treacher, that&#x27;s all, I just happen to be a very poor teacher.  Frank
