If you did then please refresh my memory. This seems to more about commenting on what others share for you than it is about doing any research yourself. Im not sure what you are looking for, if you are here to learn, correspond, or if you are just here to get a rise out of others but to be honest I do not have time for it. \n\nWhether Frank bans anyone or not is up to him entirely. But I have warned you before and I am saying it again. Cut the crap and move on. That goes for ALL of you. I dont mind discussions, I dont mind differences of opinion but I do mind BS. \n\nIf you have research to share then do so, if your research yeilds no results then state it as such. If your only purpose for being in this group is to question others, disect them, and cause negative discussions then perhaps you are wasting your time here. You are definitely wasting mine.\n\nMisty"}
