I'm glad both of your parents support you.  My dad will listen, but he doesn't want to hear it.  If you know what I mean.

          LOL Rees. You talking about your Mama reminds of my father and grandmother. On my 
dad's 65th birthday, my grandma said, "You may be 65, but you'll always be my little boy." 
:-) 

I think anyone, at any age, can appreciate having a parent in their corner if they are lucky 
enough to have that kind of relationship. I feel very fortunate indeed that both of my 
parents support my research (though it took my mom a lonnnng time to come around to it 
---- she kept saying, "You can't talk about things like this. Someone is going to come 
and take you away).

does nothing wrong. I might be 30, but in my moms eyes I still the baby boy, and I'm 
proud to be a mama's boy. Y'all have a great Sunday afternoon.
