Been following this unprofessional idiot's items for awhile now. I love how 
 he says that Frank charges thousands of dollars for an original Frank's 
box.  

This dude is the worst type of con, preying on people who know only  enough 
to be familiar with the term Frank's box. Then again, it always has  
bothered me when people take shack hacks and charge stupid prices for them on  
ebay under the Frank's box moniker.

This guy is based out of Nevada I  believe, and his group's ethics leave 
little to be desired. Takes all kinds, I  reckon...
