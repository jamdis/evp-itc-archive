Dave: (NOT EVP) 'How many of you are are testing today?'

Response : "Fourty Seven"

Dave: 'Please state your name, thank you'

Response : "Ingrid"





Maybe it's dumb question, but..................

If the flame is being "modulated" by air movements caused by 
atmosphereic sound pressure waves, so the flame varies at an audio 
rate, then those flame variations are picked up via the photo 
transistor and converted to electrical signals...what's the difference 
between the optical mic, and an accoustic mic? And why would one want 
to introduce yet another seemingly exotic piece of hardware?

I know it's interesting, but it really has nothing to do with how to 
get ghost voices, and maybe misleading to some that are searching for 
that magic technology.
