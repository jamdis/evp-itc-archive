<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Those are some good files you&#x27;ve collected Ralph.  Especially the one
that says, &quot;you&#x27;re now prepared for contact by telephone.&quot;  That one
is very clear to me.  

Does that mean they are going to start calling?  If they ever want to
call me, they better be listed because I screen all my calls. 
Something like Spirit Realm or Steve&#x27;s Spirit on the caller i.d. is
all I need.  I&#x27;d definitely answer then.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt;  Ralph the Ghost Hunter here. Just letting you all know I have posted 
&gt; some new RS 12-469 files as MP3 files to save space. I hope you all 
&gt; enjoy them as some of these are very interesting. I doubt if any radio 
&gt; stations said any of what I posted on here from the RS Hack Box. You 
&gt; can tell me what your thoughts are on them if you like. Maybe some of 
&gt; you may understand what they are trying to say. Oh well you all take 
&gt; care for now and keep up the good work people. I do like the one that 
&gt; called me a &quot; Dumb shit &quot; LOL when I asked &quot; who are the Shadow 
&gt; People ? &quot; They are funny sometimes. You gotta love it. The RS 20-125 
&gt; model seems to be alittle clearer with less clutter I think. Will post 
&gt; some of those when I get a chance. Happy Sweeping everyone !!!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Ralph the Ghost Hunter
