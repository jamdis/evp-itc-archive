<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thank you :) for the reply
I didn&#x27;t know that this had been tried yet, but i am new to this list
and to this way of communication, (i do know spiritual medium people
who are very good and real and genuine (can take quite some energy to
communicate this way for them though, so i am still happy about this
&#x27;alternative&#x27; (or let&#x27;s say: other way :)
it&#x27;s quite natural and handy, too.)
so thank you for being so kind to gently inform the newbie a not even
ignoring me completely ;)
i had also been thinking just now that one would probably also would
like to add some number of &#x27;silent spaces&#x27; to the alphabetical letter
sequence that is to be randomized, as to be able to give the replyer
the ability to space the letters and the words. (and perhaps even give
it time to think about what it would like to phrase)

With kindness,
Joel





&gt; I used the phrase &quot;the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&quot; in Stefan&#x27;s
&gt; evpmaker and have had interesting results including some live. I tried other
&gt; pangrams (contain every letter of english alphabet) but the one I felt drawn
&gt; to use was the one that has had the best results.
&gt;
&gt; No two sessions are ever alike and as background sound its easily modulated
&gt; into quite complicated sentences and word structures.

&gt; You know, i was thinking:
&gt; If you could build a random event generator built on the spoken
&gt; letters of the alphabet,
&gt; that would definately be nice and very good.</pre>
