What about copying it from one of the chips?

The chip is a microcontroller. It needs a program =
called "firmware" put into it before it will do anything useful. The chips =
have a program memory which comes blank when you buy them.The "code" is the=
 representation of what is called machine language that tells the various p=
arts of the microcontroller what to do. In this case, I imagine it increase=
s a voltage with a certain pattern and then drops it down to zero, starting=
 over again and repeating at a certain rate. This would produce a repetitiv=
e sweep of the radio at a certain rate when the microcontroller is hooked u=
p to the radio correctly.It wouldn't be difficult for me to write my own pr=
ogram to do this with a PIC microcontroller, but if someone else has alread=
y done it, why bother?If I can't get my hands on the machine code, I'll wri=
te some myself.ZackOn Fri, 4 Jan 2008, mllejade wrote:> Frank, please let m=
