What live recordings did you feed into  \nEVPMaker?\n\nI wonder if working with their own voice in EVPmaker makes it easier  \nfor them to construct an EVP? These are some of the clearest EVP  \nthrough EVPmaker that I have ever heard. I am really astounded.\n\nAnn\n\nOn May 18, 2007, at 12:58 PM, Misty Dawn wrote:\n\n&gt; These are from a few days ago (attached to this post for new  \n&gt; members you need to set status to &quot;individual email&quot; setting for  \n&gt; the group to get attachments). I decided since I downloaded some of  \n&gt; Edison&#39;s historical speech to compare to my evp voice that I  \n&gt; wondered what I would get if I threw one of those into evpmaker. I  \n&gt; got a little more than I thought I would. It even made me have to  \n&gt; google to look up the meaning of one of the technical words LOL\n&gt;\n&gt; I also included the evp vs life speech side by side comparison with  \n&gt; the evp I got from ST method.
