I think everyone is real busy getting their ducks in\na row for the upcoming holiday.  Who knows? LOL \n\nYeah, Rosemary wrote the articles for TAPS mag and its probably one of\nthe best portrayals of the Frank&#39;s box there is. At least Rosemary\nactually spoke with, witnessed and interviewed people who know a\nlittle about this machine, to include Frank himself. Its nice to read\na positive, informed account rather than the guessing and stabbing in\nthe dark I have heard and written by ignorant naysayers.\n\nKudos Rosemary!\n\nFrank R.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; This is an incredible field and nobody has posted in days.
