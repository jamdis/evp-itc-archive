<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes Ron, I think this an important step, not so much for the results 
perhaps, but for what it has to say about the process. Some deep 
thinking required ..
Anyway, heres another voice that I sucked off. Not sure what is says, 
as havent given it much processing or listening. There&#x27;s heaps more 
of them in that file that Mike has posted.

&gt; Heard that as iyou did. That is really an important step 
dontyathink Mike and Jeff. Not sure what it means and what you can 
do with it but I trust you guys are already thinking and working on 
it. I especially like the light show that goes with it....you can 
take that show on the road...lights, sound, spirit voices, action. 
Hope to see and hear more about it. ron
