I don't much about how this works either but, from what we were told years  
ago, it always seemed to give spirit energy if a person talked first, so i 
think  they some how pull energy out of the other person's voice, a glass of 
clear  water in the same room helps too.  Spirit's move at a quicker rate,  
and because they are on a higher vibration level, they are moving  faster 
than us, only for them it's like has always been because  it's kind of like 
being in a high rise apartment building i guess, right  now, we are all on 
the 1st floor so to speak, when we leave our body we go up  the stairs and are 
on the 2nd floor, between the floors are a ceiling and a  floor, and just 
because we find it hard to talk to those on the 2nd floor,  doesn't mean they 
are not there just the same, it's very real over there for  them just as it 
is for us.  Maybe, one day the ceiling and floor will  disappear and we can 
all be together again.

Frank, I think you misunderstood or misread something somewhere. The  
AAEVP/Sarah Estep Research Fund is not for AAEVP to do the research, it's for  
them to fund OUTSIDE organizations for THEIR scientific research on the study  
of EVP. The Windbridge Institute received some of this sponsor money for 
what  they called "Real-time EVP Conversations: A Pilot Study." The method for 
this  communication was *not* based on radio sweep, nor traditional 
methods, so it's  not based on what I assume many people here are doing. And in 
fact, it *was*  based on the creations of someone outside of the USA, so I'm a 
little confused  as to why all the hostility toward AAEVP for putting up the 
 money.

Sadly, radio sweep methods don't, and may not for a long time,  get the 
respect of the scientific community that it deserves (then again,  seems no 
form of EVP does), but at least this current research is a step in  the right 
direction. I hope, when Windbridge concludes their study, that it  will 
support the notion that there is apparent communication formed in ways  that 
cannot be explained by currently known and understood laws of nature.  THAT 
alone, in my opinion, would be a big plus for all ITC communities,  regardless 
of the method from which that communication was received. What's  the old 
saying? "It takes but one white crow to prove all crows are not  black." Any 
proof, derived from any EVP method, would be greatly welcomed as  far as I'm 
concerned.
