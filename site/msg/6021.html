No, I don't believe in coincidence!!  I was told about John Hutchison yeste=
rday by a biophysics engineer, who said he's selling quantum batteries from=
 his website and can be contacted directly by email.

  Yes, I have liste=
ned to him on Coast to Coast AM before. He was never 
  able to explain how=
 his levitation of objects worked. The military was 
  interested in his ex=
periments...but could never dulicate the effects. 
  Not sure where he is w=
ith things, now, other than selling his videos.

  I can't believe you post=
ed this, as I was just thinking of him 
  (especially his workshop and conn=
ecting it with Frank S for some 
  reason) in the last day or so. Coinciden=
ce? Probably not.
