That made me dig out one of mine. They were talking about art but when I was listening i heard &quot;its oliver (all over) misty come closer to art work of art&quot; and in my mind I was thinking art/painting/craft aka images not art bell LOL so had to dig it out to see if thats still what i hear thru the fuzz.\n   \n  The image group and the regular evp group communicate in different ways so I still think they meant images, however they have been trying to get me to move out of this neighborhood but I am not moving closer to art bell.
