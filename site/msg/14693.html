This is a wonderful recording, were you able to  free any of them?  So sad 
to see them still there behind bars, must be very  lonely for them, they 
should be moving on so, they can start to work on making  up for things on the 
other side.  You folks should go up there again, and  hold a small prayer 
vigil for them, of course they would no longer be ghosts  trapped there, but 
there are plenty more around. sf

I was invited to spend the night in the West Virginia Penitentiary this  
past weekend. I was asked to give a short demonstration with my Optimus 12-797 
 hacked radio. Deep inside the prison surrounded by concrete and steel, the 
 radio could not pick up any radio stations in manual mode. I wasn't sure 
how  this might effect the demonstration. I was pleasantly suprised with the  
results. I recorded the session and the results can be heard at this link.
