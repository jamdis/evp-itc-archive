 Incase anyone is interested, and I know there were some that bought the L=
M3820 cuz they were cheap.  I have not tested this yet, but it's the correc=
ted version. I left out the 330 ohm resistor before, resulting in the chip =
distruction, or non function. You'll probably need a seperate RF amp for ea=
ch shortwave band, or just use it for AM. I might try a broad band RF amp f=
or the input. The sweep circuits , and audio amps would be used with this. =
The coils at this point are cut and try, I don't know the values.  Frank-S
