I don&#39;t like attention, and \n&gt;definitely\n&gt;  not the center of anyone&#39;s attention!  Sounds like more all nighters to \n&gt;me!!\n&gt;  I stayed up almost all night Monday so I could build yet another board,\n&gt;  while I&#39;m working I have these other ideas floating around in my head,\n&gt;  waiting for a place to land. Like revisiting Spircom, and trying to apply\n&gt;  what I know to it, thanks to Ryan! I think if I were to make a square \n&gt;wave\n&gt;  audio generator, since a square wave contains all hamonics, randomly tune \n&gt;it\n&gt;  to get that random function, then use that to modulate a simple \n&gt;transmtter,\n&gt;  then receive that signal on a simple reciever a short distance away, \n&gt;maybe I\n&gt;  can do something like Meek did. The transmitter/receiver can be made with\n&gt;  mixer chips, like the SA602, and I have some in my junk box (a techy&#39;s \n&gt;parts\n&gt;  bins). Then the audio circuits are again just op amps, and I just got an\n&gt;  order in.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;ve often wondered about the possiblity of modulating a White Noise\n&gt;  signal, then listening for a response on a White Noise based receiver, \n&gt;using\n&gt;  White Noise instead of a local oscillator, yeah, using normal voice to\n&gt;  modulate the noise. You could use crystal filters to narrow the \n&gt;transmission\n&gt;  to a small RF spectrum, something easy, like around 10mhz, but I&#39;m not \n&gt;sure\n&gt;  if ultra sound might not be better, since there&#39;s  some that claim that&#39;s\n&gt;  where the spirits hang out. We need an Edison set up, a room full of\n&gt;  researchers testing ideas.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;  __________________________________________________________\n&gt;  Get live scores and news about your team: Add the Live.com Football Page\n&gt;  http://www.live.com/?addtemplate=football\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Join a yahoo group today!\n&gt;   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVPSANANTONIO/\n&gt;   http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/\n&gt;\n&gt;   www.myspace.com/lon3_s7ar\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------\n&gt;Sucker-punch spam with award-winning protection.\n&gt;  Try the free Yahoo!
