I was asking a mutual friend about that. Have you looked into a patent? Lic=
ensing by the FCC? A manufacturer and assembler? Quality control? Legal fun=
d to answer court challenges? Loopholes around the legalities such as manuf=
acture it as a toy instead of another type of consumer electronic. Marketin=
g to get stores to carry your product?

I realize you do not want to make m=
oney off this but if you don't patent it you lose all legal rights to the d=
esign and process, someone else will gain it and make money off of it. If y=
ou make money from your box at least you will control where it goes. Your f=
avorite charity, in an R&D account, grandchildren's college fund or whateve=
r righteous cause you want. 

Just an idea! Even if you don't want to get r=
ich and I understand that, you better want to keep control of it. Governmen=
t also has ways of making innovative new concepts disappear. I don't want t=
o see your noble intentions backfire because the majority of the world don'=
t share your kindness. If you don't control this someone with less than nic=
e motivations will and then you have no say on what happens.

Nikola Tesla =
wanted the world to have free energy but he still patented all of his ideas=
 and inventions. Think about it Frank.

Just interjecting a little realism,=

            Thanks;



I only use the boxes at home, "they" come=
 to me, and there are some that 

transmit somehow from distant locations, =
such as different ciries, and 

further. Yeah, it's much more than "ghosts"=
.



I need to quit "dicking around", and get the production model going!
