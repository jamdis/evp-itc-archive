As usual, ignore all facts and all other=\r\n methods, such as EVPmaker, which forms all the voices inside&nbsp;the comp=\r\nuter. Ignore all phone EVP messages, ignore all voices heard with no electr=\r\nonic aids. Ignore messages received via turned off TV and printers--and on =\r\nand on, yet they know all about EVP..Ignore the fact that probably thousand=\r\ns use boxes successfully.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&quot;We have conducted a few listening studies of reported radio-sweep EVP and =\r\nthe results have not been good. We have also worked with a variety of such =\r\ndevices. Based on what we know about trans-etheric influences, how EVP and =\r\nvisual forms of ITC are formed and what we know about mediumship, it is dif=\r\nficult to fit radio-sweep into any established hypothesis. Without solid re=\r\nsearch supporting it as producing EVP, it is impossible for us to recommend=\r\n it or support its use. If there were double-blind studies conducted by exp=\r\nerienced researchers that shows it does produce phenomena, we would gladly =\r\npromote it as an alternative technique.&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;We are pretty sure th=\r\nat, in transform EVP (ordinary recorder), the voice is formed in the electr=\r\nonics by transforming available audio-frequency noise in an active part of =\r\nthe electronics such as a transistor junction. We think the process is ampl=\r\nification of a weak telekinetic signal via stochastic resonance and we have=\r\n found that the optimum audio-frequency signal for this is a chaotic one ri=\r\nch in voice-frequencies with many transient perturbation. That is our worki=\r\nng hypothesis. &quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;I can&#39;t say who this i=\r\ns from, cuz almost certain I&#39;d get sued.
