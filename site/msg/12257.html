<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Al,

To answer your first question I provide this link:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S-4e-wxd6U
It&#x27;s a video that better explains how I think it might work. (Just a 
couple of possibilites).

To answer your second question... I have done three experimentation 
sessions so far, and the results differ.  In one I got no response, 
and in the other two I did get action but I&#x27;m unsure on what caused 
it.  I&#x27;m reviewing it further.

My use of the Ion lamp, which is away from the traditional &#x27;video-
loop&#x27; method is based on things I&#x27;ve read from those who were into 
this EVP/ITC thing way before us.  Back in the 1960&#x27;s there was much 
experimentation going on that involved a varied range of frequencies, 
including light frequencies.  Even house plants were considered into 
the EVP/ITC equation (Maybe I&#x27;ll try that next).

My use of the Ion lamp goes along with a continued desire to further 
the work of the dedicated group from the 1960&#x27;s... and continue to 
see if &#x27;other&#x27; ideas work.

After all... sweeping radio signals, and snowy video pictures are 
only a couple of snippets of the frequencies available for 
experimentation.  Even my limited idea of what the Ion lamp might do 
could be way off... but I have to try it.  I might be surprised what 
it might be capable of.  It might not only offer increased intensity 
and stimulation. Maybe it could even offer more than that.

I&#x27;ll keep trying new things... and I&#x27;ll make sure to share them with 
the group.

Thanks for asking...

- Mike

&gt; An interesting setup, Mike...
&gt; I do have a question though.,..what is the ion lamp for? 
&gt; Have you had any success photographing any spirits?

tour of 
&gt; the EVP and ITC systems I use, with a quick explanation of their 
setup.
