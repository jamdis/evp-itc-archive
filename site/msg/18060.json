The exper=\r\niment was for participants to  determine what it was. \nVague or partial ans=\r\nwers wouldn&#39;t be counted  (for example, just colors, \nshapes, sizes, what i=\r\nt&#39;s made of, etc):  we&#39;re looking for what it is. \nParticipants could use t=\r\nheir ghost  boxes, EVP recorders, or I suppose any other \nmeans they  chose=\r\n.\n\nIn order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the  object at the start=\r\n of \nthe experiment and loaded it to the Files  section (RJ folder) of this=\r\n \ngroup. If you can follow the link, it is  here:\n\n_http://tech. groups.yah=\r\noo. com/group/  EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710. \n1.zip_ (http://tech.groups.=\r\nyahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip) \n\nThe idea was that  yo=\r\nu could download the file at the beginning of the \ntest, and &#39;keep  it safe=\r\n&#39; on your computer. Then at the end of the test, I would \n release the pass=\r\nword so you could reveal the contents of the file.  That \nway, you were in =\r\ncontrol of the original image during the  entire test, not \nme. \n\nThe passw=\r\nord for that file is:  123BlastOff\nInstructions, if you need them, are also=\r\n in that RJ  folder.\n\nAnd if you did not care to download the zip file  bef=\r\nore the test, I will \npost the final image there too.\n\nSo to  the results:\n=\r\n\nNumber of participants: 5\nTotal tries:  8\nAmbiguous answers: 0\nCorrect ans=\r\nwers: 0\n\nObject: A  radio\nUzipped picture:\n_http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/=\r\ngroup/  EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710. \n1.JPG_ (http://tech.groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG) \n\nSo what do the  results mean?=\r\n All that we can really agree on from this \nexperiment  is that no particip=\r\nant, with whatever theories or methods or  \ntechnology they used, was able =\r\nto correctly determine the object. We  can&#39;t say \nthose theories or methods=\r\n or technologies never work. Just  as we can&#39;t say \nthey do. Just that, for=\r\n whatever reason, they did  not work this time. \nReaders can take the resul=\r\nts, use them to  improve or change their methods, or \nkeep doing what they&#39;=\r\nre  doing.\n\nIf anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for  improve=\r\nment, let me \nknow.
