Hi all;
 
 Okay, finally got a video converter to work, so up loaded longe=
r videos to you tube. There should be three from today. I'm not usre if the=
 largest one went through, it's only 6 minutes though. then another is aobu=
t a minute, and the next about 20 seconds. I had to do multiples cuz the ra=
ndom mode wouldn't work for the first run. the purpose of the videos are to=
 show the world waht the box is supposed to soudn like. I ask them to say m=
y name, and they may have said Frank, but I could hear them say Princess a =
couple times.
