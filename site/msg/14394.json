I do clean\nup evps if I hear something and can&#39;t make it out do to ambient noise.  So\nhear is my question.  When do you stop cleaning up?  Wouldn&#39;t to much\nenhancing &quot;taint&quot; the results?  To me the more enhancing you do the less\nconvincing it becomes.  I hope noone finds this offensive, it is not meant\nto be I am just really curious.  The way I look at it is that if you have to\ndo so much enhancing to find anything, was there really something there to\nbegin with.  Are we just making ourselves believe there is something there??\n\nEric\n\nNow I may be biased o he \"in es iga ion\" way o doing hings.  I do clean up e ps i I hea some hing and can' make i ou do o ambien noise.  So hea is my ques ion.  When do you s op cleaning up?  Wouldn' o much enhancing \" ain \" he esul s?  To me he mo e enhancing you do he less con incing i becomes.  I hope noone inds his o ensi e, i is no mean o be I am jus eally cu ious.  The way I look a i is ha i you ha e o do so much enhancing o ind any hing, was he e eally some hing he e o begin wi h.  A e we jus making ou sel es belie e he e is some hing he e??\nE ic"}
