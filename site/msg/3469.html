<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Zack, I&#x27;ve read that some people from AA-EVP &amp; Sarah Estep who wrote &quot;Voices Of Eternity&quot; (oop book) use the Panasonic RR Dr60 IC recorder as it is the best recorder for getting EVP&#x27;s! That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s expensive + they were discontinued - due to the EVP &quot;voices&quot;!!!  =Judy=            . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

&gt; Why is this such a prized DVR?  I don&#x27;t see that you can even download the 
&gt; audio to your computer.
&gt; 
&gt; I paid about $60 for a brand-new Olympus VN-960PC.  It records 6 hours in 
&gt; hi-quality mode and comes with USB connector cable and software to copy 
&gt; your files to your computer.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ve also used it to record ham radio conversations, Morse code and bird 
&gt; calls and it does an excellent job for all of those. Radio Shack carries 
&gt; similar models made by Olympus now.
