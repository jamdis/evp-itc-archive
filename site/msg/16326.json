I have been experimenting with a few different allophone files that\nhave been slowed down. Evpmaker is pretty cool but I guess I am wondering if\nI am just imaging what is being said??\n\nCan anyone shed some light on this perhaps- how likely is it that the\nallophone files can generate words etc?\n\n:D\n\n\nThanks\n\nI ied his o he 1s ime oday.I am somewha pe plexed- is he e any way ha he allophone iles can andomly gene a e wo ds... like \"bi ch\" - I am ai ly su e I hea d his a numbe o imes, as well as o he bi s and pieces?
