Exactly my point... You don't charge anything for t=

and Chris Moon charges people for using it....
If it's not perfect=
ed then Chris shouldn't charge either......
If he wasn't so public with it,=
 then people like me wouldn't dislike him so much.
=A0
The only people that=
 have your boxes (that the public hear about)
are the well known paranormal=
 groups and famous people.
I am sure that you have given boxes to researche=
rs who are not in the popular
paranormal community ,and don't want to be. T=
hose are the ones that should
get respect.=A0 And of course YOU are well re=
spected by us lowly researchers. ( Kissin up , so you won't get mad)
=A0
An=
d I am sure that you are sick of hearing about Chris Moon and how
alot of p=
eople thinks he sucks. And everyone wants a box......
But you have to expec=

<DIV> However, it's constantly changing. The radio I made tonight i=
s very simple, and can significantly simplify construction. I used to make =
the sweep and amplifier circuits, then use a commercial radio, like the 12-=
469, as a tuner. </DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV> The MK484 is follwed b=
y a couple high impedence op amp stages to bring the audio up to line level=
s. I haven't had time to do schematic yet. I draw the schematics with MS pa=
int, and they are stored as jpeg images, which isn't the best, but it =
makes them e-mailable. </DIV>

<DIV>Hi folks, I just joined this group.  I was recently=
 at the Lizzy Borden house in Massachusetts with Chris Moon and had a sessi=
on with Frank's Box.  The results were astounding.  Is this the n=
ewest schematic for Frank's box?  If so, is there a way to get a clear=
er copy of it?  My son said he would build one for me and I have been =
searching for the schematic.  Can anyone help? - Elaine<BR></DIV></DIV=
