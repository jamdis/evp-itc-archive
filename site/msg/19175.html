<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That is why I use the natural trifield solely on a flat surface, typically
during a sit down EVP session, and never while moving.  They say you can use
it while moving but I would not trust any results.

The device on the webpage listed looks damn impressive.  Unfortunately I am
a electro-ignoramus, but reading the description of the device was quite
intriguing.  I cannot assemble such devices, but I can understand their use.
 This device appears to have a wonderful range of application.

Is there any video online of this device being used? My curiosity is piqued.

The natural trifield is woefully inadequate for paranormal research and
&quot;real&quot; meters are so damn expensive that I cannot justify spending the
monetary amount they command at the present time.

&gt; The Trifield Natural EMF meter is not the same as the general Trifield
&gt; meter. It is very sensitive to the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. It is in magnetic
&gt; mode that I have the most trouble. They state this problem in the manual.
&gt; Moving too fast or turning causes the meter to flick. I have the knob for
&gt; the audible beep trigger turned down most of the time because the constant
&gt; beeps when I walk or turn get annoying.
&gt;
&gt; It is a TriFIELD meter, not a TriAXIS meter. I always assumed it had that
&gt; name because it has settings to detect electric, magnetic and RF
&gt; (electromagnetic) fields. Those are the three fields it is capable of
&gt; detecting.
&gt;
&gt; I also built the scalar electrostatic gradiometer but the thing is not
&gt; always stable (especially in high-humidity settings). But it surpasses
&gt; anything you can buy commercially.

&gt;&gt; This device is misused by almost everybody!  This is because the manual
&gt;&gt; sucks and the TV people use it wrong consistently.  To figure it out, I
&gt;&gt; contacted the manufacturer a couple years back and this is what they told
&gt;&gt; me.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Always us the Trifield in Magnetic mode.  If the box is stable and there
&gt;&gt; is no lightning, the box should not sound an alarm unless something
&gt;&gt; paranormal is happening (or you move your digital recorder to close to it,
&gt;&gt; magnetized speakers).  If you use electric or combination, you can, and
&gt;&gt; will, pick up the body electric with every motion and may receive many false
&gt;&gt; positives.  The meter should also never be used while walking because this
&gt;&gt; too gives unreliable readings.  There is nothing worse than seeing some TV
&gt;&gt; schmuck holding it in their hands and claiming something paranormal is going
&gt;&gt; on because an alarm is sounding, never mind that the camera is right next to
&gt;&gt; it emitting magnetism through the mic / internal speaker.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also, the name trifield is a misnomer.  It only has one plane of reading,
&gt;&gt; not three!  The yellow one (AC) has three fields.  The natural trifield only
&gt;&gt; measures the plane that extends from the top and bottom edges lengthwise
&gt;&gt; from the devices.  So if you have the device sitting upright, you will only
&gt;&gt; measure whatever is above the device.  If you have it laying flat, you will
&gt;&gt; be able to measure the full plane of length extending beyond the bottom and
&gt;&gt; top edges.  Therefore, it is best to use this device slightly elevated and
&gt;&gt; laying flat.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Using it in this fashion has yielded some amazing results thus far.  While
&gt;&gt; it is rare for this meter to fire when used properly, when a &quot;spirit&quot;
&gt;&gt; understands how to trigger the alarm you can get conversations that can last
&gt;&gt; upwards of an hour.  I have experiences this only 6 times in all the years I
&gt;&gt; have investigated.  Most of the time, this device yields a single alarm, or
&gt;&gt; maybe two, with no real time interaction with questions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have a Trifield Natural EMF meter. It does not respond to 60 Hz fields.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem I have with it is that it is too darned sensitive. It registers
&gt;&gt;&gt; the magnetic field of the earth in magnetic and combination mode and
&gt;&gt;&gt; whenever I turn or move too quickly, the meter flicks. If I run it in
&gt;&gt;&gt; electric field mode it does not do this but I&#x27;m always afraid of missing
&gt;&gt;&gt; something, so I generally run it in combination mode.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like Zack said, nobody knows for sure.  The only thing that we do know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is that there is a correlation between spikes in EMF&#x27;s and paranormal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; events.  I have used various meters during GB sessions and there is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correlation at times, but this has to be discounted solely because a radio
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uses part of the EMF spectrum.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is theorized that EMF measurements are to be taken solely in DC
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; current because it is natural electricity.  So any EMF meter you have that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; measures AC is worthless on an investigation because it picks up man made
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; electricity.  As for the range, well that is also speculative at best.  The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most current theories hold that under 30 Hz DC is where you will find the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most paranormal activity.  This is because the Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brainwaves of a human are all below 30 Hz.  This is where the Body Electric
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fires and consciousness is formed.  If we are dealing with a continuation of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consciousness, results are more apt to be found in this range.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Interestingly enough, the earth vibrates in this same range with 5 standing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; waves at or below 33Hz (Shuman Resonance), so it appears that the new agers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are right when they say we vibrate with the Earth.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But, as always, no one knows for sure.  And no one knows if these
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; frequencies have anything to do with what we receive in GBC.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This has probably already been discussed a hundred times over by people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; building ghost boxes, but... what&#x27;s the average emf range of ghosts... and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would creating sounds in that emf range make it easier for the ghosts to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; communicate? And would it be possible to make those sounds heard somehow?
