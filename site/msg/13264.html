Hello Ron, and thanks for the interesting reply. I have posted a few times =
before in this forum which I think have answered your question about my exp=
eriences.=A0 They would be under Rick or Rj.=A0 To summarize, I have not po=
sted any clips, and I do not have any results that I would make any claims =
about at all.=A0 My interests here are more in the areas of process and met=
hodologies.

I have gathered, as you noted, that may of the members here ar=
en't really doing anything scientific, but are more in the hobbyist or enth=
usiast mode.=A0 That's cool.=A0 I know of people who like to go fishing, ju=
st to enjoy the company, or the alone-time, and don;t want to catch anythin=
g or produce anything either, but just enjoy the time.=A0 I'm certainly not=
 trying to tell people what to do with their time!

But just in cast there =
is someone reading, who might like to use some methodology to help them tes=
t and refine their ideas, or who is not just one of the hobbyists to which =
you allude, but trying to be a researcher who can show objective results, o=
r hopes to make progress with their innovation, I present these ideas.=A0 T=
hey are, actually, not what one would call a full blown scientific methodol=
ogy (since in this case, that would require first proving that there are sp=
irits out there before trying to claim that they are what are shaping the n=
oises on your device).=A0 But they are a tool to help direct anyone who is =
trying different techniques, and looking for an objective way to determine =
which techniques seem to be the most promising.=A0 I don't think this is lo=
oking for proof of anything, or trying to debunk anything.=A0 It's just try=
ing to assess experimental results, which in this field I understood can be=
 tricky.=A0 As Misty noted, different people can
 hear different things tha=
n she does, and its a nice surprise when they do hear the same thing.=A0 Ma=
ybe it would be an even nicer surprise if, under the conditions I outlined,=
 a lot of people heard the same things!

Again, I am not trying to advocate=
 debunking your creativity or ideas. But for anyone who is looking for some=
 new tools, this time in the realm of process and methodology, to help them=
 with their explorations, I'd be happy to offer more ideas there.=A0 Were t=
here any points in my process Ron that you took exception to, don't find va=
lue in, or think can be improved?,

I know what you mean Misty - it does seem that interpr=

ess is to get an audio sample that you think is most representative of a gi=

 Name the file something innocuous (like File1) and don';t tell the people =
you send it to what you think you hear.=A0 Also, ask the people not to disc=
uss the file with anyone else, and have them send what they think they hear=
 directly back to you,rather than posting the results in a forum or group.
=

I think that kind of test is helpful, since it seems to me that once someo=
ne tells me what the audio clip sounds like, then it's hard for me to hear =
anything else in it.=A0 But,that could be influencing my interpretation (li=
ke someone pointing to a cloud, telling me its a horse, and then I have tro=
uble NOT seeing a horse) ,so it's better to listen
 before it is suggested =
to me what i should be hearing.

This way, I think the most progress can be=
 made, because if people just keep confirming what we think we hear, and it=
 turns out it's just noise that we are forcing an interpretation into, we w=
on't be making progress (though it might make us feel good to believe that =
we're being successful).=A0 Getting negative feedback to one's approach is =
not as fun, and might feel like some non-believer is trying to debunk us.=
=A0 But, really, that can be the best feedback for progress, since it helps=
 us to change tactics when our current approach is not effective, rather th=
an continuing down an ineffective path, getting accolades from friends, but=
 missing out on other paths that might show more promise,.

Thanks RJ

I never k=
