Both versions \ni believe have buttons on it with a digital face.  Mine is White, \ni&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the old design or new.  The White one you \nhave to pull the pin off the board, it&#39;s 3rd up from the bottom and \nsays mute next to it.  I used a pair of needle noise pliers and \nripped it out, but probably not the best method.  You probably \nshould heat up the solder on the back of the board and than just \npull it out.  It works really well though, i&#39;m gonna try $1 store \nradios next and see what happens.  If it works they also have $1 \nstore speakers too.  A nice $2 combo box w/speakers, sounds too good \nto be true so i&#39;m sure you can&#39;t modify the cheap ones.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, William Murphy &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for clarifying that. Hey Steve, do you think the dial or \nbutton version of the radio is better for what we do?

Another member posted that on \nhere, \n&gt;  his name is Sum.  I was bored yesterday and bought a radio from \n&gt;  radio shack and did the modification in my kitchen and only took \na \n&gt;  few moments to do.  I recorded a five minute session and got some \n&gt;  good files from it, so i sent it to Sum to show him that the \nradio \n&gt;  worked and thanked him for helping me with the mod.  He asked if \nhe \n&gt;  could use my files on that site that he was making \nghostboxhack.com  \n&gt;  so i said sure.  I&#39;m just a researcher, but after yesterday i \nfeel i \n&gt;  can do some basic stuff with electronics now.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  -Steve H.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Wow how cool is that?
