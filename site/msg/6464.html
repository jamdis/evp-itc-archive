Dave,
 
I left the aa-evp about two years ago.
After being a participating=
 member and even working with a few
other select members on cold case EVP t=
he butlers did not feel that anything but an a+
quality evp was acceptable.=
 Tom had explained to me that my EVP files where edited so therefore
in his=
 opinion useless and my services would be no longer needed.
 
When I say ed=
ited I mean the volume was amplified because we were doing silent EVP in a =
silent room.
He suggested we ask a series of questions before the evp sessi=
on and then turn the recorder on and let it run.
 
I received numerous mess=
ages pertaining to the cases we worked on including names, places, dates an=
d where the remains
of the victim could be found. The evp files where disca=
rded and never brought to light because tom and Lisa did not feel they wher=
e worthy
because they had some of the static hiss removed and had been ampl=
ified.
 
I tried repeatedly to explain that unless the disembodied spirit w=
here grounded in the location and close proximity to the recorder how was i=
t
possible to catch class A+ evp's.
 
Well to make a long story no longer,
=
We had a parting of the way's and I left the organization. I firmly believe=
 that the Butlers would never be open to the idea of box research.
