I am amazed that someonme actually tried this! It does work. There was \na Danish(I think) researcher doing the same thing, but never could make \ncontact with them. I have done this myself, and it can work wiht TV too, if \nyou can switch channels fast ennough. I think you could use a steeper motor \ncontroler to randomly turn a stepper moter, to turn the dial. Manually \nspinning the dial has one advantage, the sound is clearer! I have yet to see \na method of ITC that produces better results that the random tuning methods.\n\nFrank\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot; RetroCom&quot; &lt;vfp19968@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Sweep Tuning of AM Radio Band\n&gt;Date: Mon, 19 Mar 2007 17:19:47 -0700\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I have a very sensitive old AM tuner with a flywheel tuning system. I tried \n&gt;several recording sessions manually sweeping the tuner through the AM band \n&gt;late at night. I got pretty good at keeping the dial moving at a constant \n&gt;rate of speed. This is not nearly as good as Frank&#39;s &#39;hands off&#39; random \n&gt;tuning method but it still produced some results. What impressed me most is \n&gt;that some of the voices sound the same, even though I tuned through several \n&gt;channels. This attached capture could be a technical message.\n&gt;&quot;Plug a million hertz&quot;   One Million Hertz = 1mhz = 1000khz, which is close \n&gt;the center frequency for the AM broadcast band.\n&gt;Dave\n\n\n&gt;&lt;&lt; 031907plugamillionhertz.mp3 &gt;&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\ni&#39;m making a difference.���Make every IM count for the cause of your choice. \nJoin Now. \nhttp://clk.atdmt.com/MSN/go/msnnkwme0080000001msn/direct/01/?href=http://im.live.com/messenger/im/home/?source=hmtagline"}
