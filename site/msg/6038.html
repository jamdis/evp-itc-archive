hehehe I believe it! I saw a show once with talking dogs, they said a variety of things, one of them was even on a tv commercial saying I love you
   
  They have vocal ability, they learn english, they have brains... so why not
   
  Lauras dog started barking during one of her ITC sessions and some evp voices came out in that bark when we played it back. I said look your dogs talkin LOL
   
  Our male chihuahua tries to vocalize, he tries to copy whatever you are saying as long as you start with OOO OOO OOO hehehehe then whatever comes after he will try to copy. He finally gives up and just starts barking loud all excited.
   
  I know Brian Jones has some interest in what animals say, last I heard he was planning on researching into that more dunno if he stuck with it.

smallest Yorkie let out a loud bark, and I swear it said "get outta 
here". I heard it as plan as any other speech. 

I know, anecdotal evidence.
