Too bad the interest in EVP doesn&#39;t pick up while that ghost hunting mentality drops off. I keep saying, you&#39;ll get better, more consistent, and more meaningful messages if you record at home. The ghosts, spirits and entities can and do travel. You also have to listen to the recordings more than once. \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank\n\nThat is an interesting observation.   I think the core of the issue is that there seems to be a `sweet spot&#39; in paranormal beliefs where there is just enough science, just enough technical backing, just enough paranormal claims, and just enough indefinite evidence that keeps people interested in the ghost hunting mentality\n\nEvidence which becomes too indefinite turns off most people.  As they become more aware of sensitives who simply make claims (&quot;I feel there is a GHOST here!&quot;), but provide no evidence other than statements, people eventually get bored.  Similarly, people eventually grow tired of the anthropomorphism of every little occurrence in a house: a creak implies a footstep, which implies a person, which, if not seen, implies a ghost.  But a creak does not equal a footstep.\n\nAnd while this kind of indefinite evidence can lose an audience, so can evidence that is claimed to be &quot;obviously&quot; evident by technology.  Here, the investigator is no longer making vague claims, but waving science around, like FLIR cameras, or EMF meters, and then making proclamations of the results.  But again, people eventually see these are just lights and sounds from electronics, and investigators making more claims.  It&#39;s like the psychics again, but with visual aids.\n\nI think the reason EVP studies are not securing more interest, as you noted, are a little of both effects.  First is the anthropomorphism problem: I notice many EVP experimenters proclaim what their results sound like, or name the sound file by what they&#39;ve heard.  But like the creaks, &quot;sounds like&quot; does not equal &quot;is&quot;.  This is then compounded by the technology backing: regardless of how valid the EVP researcher&#39;s results are, the technology can seem intimidating, but the researchers often proclaim the obviousness of their results.  People again become turned off by it because it is not obvious to them, and in the end it is just another piece of technology presenting sounds, with no obvious connection to the paranormal, except by the claims and interpretations of the presenters.\n\nI believe, taking these issues into account, there is a way for EVP studies to garner more interest.  For now, the analysis coming from the researchers usually seems like a claim, and it is these claims, imho, that is being classified by the public with the rest of the paranormal claims, and so, it also becomes less of an interest.  A new approach could be one without the claims and interpretations of the investigators, one where the sounds are simply played and not labeled.  The interpretation of the data could be left to the listeners.  Web sites which present EVPs could be developed where people could not see others interpretations until they entered their own.  I think this would be such a novel approach, that it would give the public a better feeling of true involvement in the research, and feel less like they are simply being exposed to the claims of others.  And I think that feeling of involvement is what is needed to reignited the public interest here."}
