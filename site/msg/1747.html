<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank Sumption, 
This is Laura, you have recieved several good messages about me. 
Well, let me intoduce myself somewhat here. I&#x27;m like you; I try to 
make things and make them work, However I am no electronics 
wiz...gosh, I wish I was. The ideas &quot;they give me I don&#x27;t understand 
that I have in my head! &quot;Them calling me princess was kind&quot; and yes 
purple women don&#x27;t smoke...I am trying to quit and they have offered 
to help me. Im doing pretty good 4 to 8 cigs a day. Otherwise I am 
hyper as heck.
I stumbled on to something in thought...maybe from &quot;them&quot; I live in 
Mexico about a good 4 hours south of the boarder. Now, all my evps or 
drv are in Ingles!!(English) can you believe that! I speak no spanish 
unless I have spanish guests with me then they do! I am willing to 
contribute a good size sum of money for &quot;resources&quot; as I am blessed 
with means to do so. Please email me privately as I would like to 
purchase a protype box from you and help encourage you to continue 
your experiments and possibly in another country and see what the 
results are, What do you think?
I also stumbled onto something...I cannot explain...but there is no 
static or noise in the background like your sweep method except I do 
have to clean it. I will most definitly post these files tomorrow.
We recived a very unsual name &quot;Germam I think: Called Ocurazck...well 
my husband found it on ancestry and someone posted a sad story about 
her brother commiting sucide 1 yr ago...she misses him dearley/ also 
recieveied info regarding the planet Saturn versus Earth. I sent 
Frank R some of these files and he can verify them, but, of course we 
all hear so differently. I use no head phones! I want to hear clear 
voices as precise as possible.
So, as Frank R. mentioned about integerity, I am willing to donate 
300 dollars for a box just to experiment with here in another 
country...and will send it back to per your request when you desire. 
Please consider this. This is south of the North Americas and a great 
opportunity to see what we can achieve. 
Please let me know your thoughts on this.
Laura
PS btw I record with Misty and Frank and others every wednesday 
night. were also looking to expand here in Mexico!!

&gt; Another from last night, this was using linear sweep. I like this 
method so 
&gt; much I might drop the random circuit from future boxes. I stayed up 
last 
&gt; night to add the linear sweep function to an old box.
&gt; 
&gt; There&#x27;s no way I can stop making boxes, I just don&#x27;t have the 
resuources to 
&gt; supply them to everyone that wants at this time, plus trying ot 
find waay to 
&gt; make the things more better. I am no engineer, and it takes a while 
to 
&gt; figure things out--as with all aspects of this life.
