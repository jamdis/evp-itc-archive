try the am band, for some reason they like that alittle better, and their is not that much noise.  I think your right, I don't think they like the 820.  I get better responses with the 469.

I have had great success with my 12-469. Hope to have some of my 
session files up soon. I have to share my computer at home with my 
16 year old son so mom doesnt get much time on it. I dont think the 
spirits like the 12-280 or I have just not learned to hear them on 
the FM band it sweeps so fast on the 12-820. I wont give up on it 
though.

I have been getting some tremendous results with it.
