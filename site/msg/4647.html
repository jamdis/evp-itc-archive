<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree with you, Ursula, in that there is a fine line between 
objective and subjective reality and that one must somehow synthesize 
the two in digesting the information for oneself.  When exchanging 
findings with others, however, I&#x27;m always willing to give in that I 
respect those who see images I may not see, or hear voices I may not 
hear, but I will not give to the point of patronization by saying 
that I, too, see that image or hear that voice if, in fact, I don&#x27;t.

&gt; I don&#x27;t know as there are &quot;hundreds&quot; of examples available to the 
public in the way of Luminator photographs, but there are a couple of 
dozen in Macy&#x27;s book, &quot;Spirit Faces,&quot; and yes, many many of them are 
open to wide interpretation, just as our humble recordings are.  In 
addition to that majority that make us say, &quot;Come on!{&quot; there are a 
handful that make you say &quot;Hmmmmmmm. . . .&quot; Just like we offer a 
handful of results from our endless recording efforts to try to 
convince the hard-nosed.
&gt;   I would think that many would see the Luminator efforts as a 
modern effort at scrying.  Everything we do crosses boundaries, and 
my point is that it&#x27;s really hard to walk the line between trying to 
be scientific and trying to be open.  It&#x27;s really, really hard! But 
if we give in one area, we have to be willing to give in another.

&gt;           This is a classic example of the kind of photo that Mark 
thinks shows 
&gt; a spirit extra. To me, clearly, this is the same woman--same hair, 
&gt; same eyes, same mouth, same nose. Again, to me, it looks like a 
&gt; classic long exposure when compared with other known long exposures-
- 
&gt; I&#x27;ve included just of hundreds of examples.
