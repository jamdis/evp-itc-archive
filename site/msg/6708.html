<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Robin,

If i may add my thoughts on this:  There is no concrete evidence of 
who or what comes through is what they say they are.  Technicians i 
have found were used to get you up and running and i only now call on 
them if i need assistance.  I don&#x27;t turn the boxes on and ask for 
them like a crutch, i conduct my session and if i need help they will 
supply it to me if needed.  I think the whole idea is to find out who 
we are communicating with, maybe we will never really know for sure 
but i still try and find out as best as i can. 

-Steve H.

&gt; Hi Frank, 
&gt; 
&gt; When you mention being distrustful of what comes through the boxes, 
are you saying you&#x27;re skeptical of the &quot;technicians&quot; being who they 
say they are?  Not trying to open another can of worms here, just 
wanting to continue learning from your experience and research.  I 
get what you&#x27;re saying about becoming obsessive with the sessions.  
I&#x27;ve probably asked you this a half dozen times over the last couple 
of years, but who or what do YOU think you&#x27;re/we&#x27;re  communicating 
with?

&gt;   Have ya tried EVPmaker? It is based on that random principle, and 
&gt;   predates the boxes.
&gt; 
&gt;   I&#x27;ve heard this stuff before, about random being the best, and I 
&gt;   have to disaggree. I also think it unwise to spend every waking 
&gt;   moment doing sessions. I think it creates that expectation, and 
&gt;   perhaps desperation to make contact, and I would tend not to 
trust 
&gt;   what comes through. 
&gt; 
&gt;   I don&#x27;t trust some of this stuff because I have yet get any 
&gt;   meaningful assistence with the boxes from the so called 
technicians. 
&gt;   All I ever got was a telepathic &quot;suggestion&quot; to use the echo 
boxes. 
&gt;   Everything else was a assemblage of stuff I had worked on in hte 
past 
&gt;   to solve the problem of &quot;what else could I use&quot;. 
&gt; 
&gt;   I hate to see yet another go down the road of &quot;this is the 
onlyest 
&gt;   way&quot;.
