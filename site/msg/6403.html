<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I thought it might have said that, too, but when I listen to it with  
the noise-canceling headphones in the TwistedWave program, and even  
now, I&#x27;m still hearing &quot;We&#x27;re in heaven.&quot; I guess we have to go with  
the possibility that it&#x27;s either. But it is still there, and you hear  
it. Phew.

Your theory is quite possible. I&#x27;ve been getting both Seven and  
Heaven. Both are welcome! I guess we&#x27;ll see how it all plays out.  
God, this is fascinating.

&gt; Hi Ann,
&gt; I reviewed your file and this is what I heard on the first run.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;we&#x27;re seven&quot;
&gt;
&gt; The fact that you had to slow the recording
&gt; by 80% brings up a few questions. I have been looking into 7
&gt; as it pertains to ITC-EVP communication and what I find I believe
&gt; I have already mentioned. Is when the amazing communication of the  
&gt; 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s was taking
&gt; place in Luxembourg and with researchers like mark Macy and that  
&gt; era of communication.
&gt;
&gt; The 7 represented themselves as angelic beings from a much higher  
&gt; spiritual level than we are used to
&gt; communicating with.
&gt; My guess is that they have begun to communicate with us and are  
&gt; trying to evaluate the workings of
&gt; our present day technology. I believe they led you to slowing the  
&gt; recording so as to discover the message hidden within.
&gt; It could be the message was buried in the recording to test our  
&gt; ability and ambition to look and listen further.
&gt; Or the communication they send from a higher plane of spirituality  
&gt; utilizes certain radio frequencies
&gt; that need to be listened to in a certain way.
&gt;
&gt; In any event I&#x27;m sure they will continue to become more apparent  
&gt; and make themselves more known to us when they are ready.
&gt; I am not suggesting you slow all your recordings to that extent and  
&gt; sift through them with a fine tooth comb, that would take a ridiculous
&gt; amount of time and effort. When they need you to hear a message or  
&gt; receive a communication , they will make sure you do.
&gt; Just like this time.
&gt;
&gt; This is just a theory I have but that is what I heard immediately  
&gt; when I played the file.
