I know my hubby wanted to surprise me too, but he wasn&#39;t sure which one to get. So he asked me which one I wanted. I&#39;ve been wanting one of these for awhile. I&#39;d like to let it run while doing a ghost box session and see if anything shows up during the session. \n\n~Draiga\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; lol my husband surprised me with one to :)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sun, 12/12/10, draiga1 &lt;mail@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: draiga1 &lt;mail@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Full Spectrum Cameras\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, December 12, 2010, 12:11 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Â  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to get a full spectrum camera. My hubby is going to get me one for my Yule gift. I want a good one that captures apparitions. Does anyone here use one with success? Or know which one is a good one?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Draiga\n&gt;"}
