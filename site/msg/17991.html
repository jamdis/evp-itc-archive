<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>What ya do is drive into a big a city with lots of radio stations, record a
few tapes, then go home and listen. &quot;They&quot; would know what you&#x27;re doing, and
make messages accordingly.
I doubt one my boxes would any better than anythign else with no stations.

&gt; Since i live rural, i wonder if my property being next to a small private
&gt; lake, and across the road about 1/4 mile is the tower for Altel now Verison
&gt; on the north west side, and same distance on the other side is ATT, they are
&gt; south east of me, then down further is another ATT tower, and plus my big
&gt; antennae on the roof, i wonder if that&#x27;s help them come through on my FM RS
&gt; 20-125 radio&#x27;s, I don&#x27;t even hear radio signal on them anymore, even on the
&gt; FM channel, it&#x27;s weird, and can&#x27;t get any AM&#x27;s either, AM&#x27;s only give me
&gt; this funny ringing noise, but the FM gives me static or them talking, I sure
&gt; wish i could buy one of those fancy boxes Franks has bet I&#x27;d be a boomin
&gt; over here!  hint hint., sf

&gt;
&gt;   My take on it is that the spirits or whatever they are are capable of
&gt; using whatever methods are placed in front of them. DVR&#x27;s get EVP. I&#x27;ve
&gt; gotten EVP on the sound tracks of a video recorder. The radio and ITC seems
&gt; to generate a different class of communication. EVP-Maker is another one.
&gt;
&gt; Probably the method of actually producing the sound waves is different for
&gt; each device.

&gt;&gt;   Raymond Bayless was getting recorded spirit voices back in the 1950&#x27;s.
&gt;&gt; While his best known work was with von Salazy on audio tape, Bayless
&gt;&gt; also received voices using an early grammophone-style recording device.
&gt;&gt; In other words, he was using strictly a mechanical recorder. This would
&gt;&gt; suggest that the voices may not require electronics at all. And that would
&gt;&gt; imply that radio signals may have nothing to do with the voice reception.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Consider too that EVPMAKER sessions seem to work well for some people.
&gt;&gt; Except for the mechnical recordings, which are few in number, all the
&gt;&gt; current techniques have electronics in common. So it would make sense
&gt;&gt; that electronics might be important to the process. However, when
&gt;&gt; you factor in the mechanical recordings made using devices prior to
&gt;&gt; modern electronics, it seems more sensible to look for a common
&gt;&gt; explanation which involves environmental manipulation. The most reasonable
&gt;&gt; thing we know of that meets this criterion is mind-matter interaction,
&gt;&gt; or psychokinesis (PK).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The only remaining question then, aside from the actual source of the
&gt;&gt; information which cannot be objectively ascertained as of yet, is whether
&gt;&gt; a single or multiple mechanisms are indeed at work. Even though radio
&gt;&gt; waves
&gt;&gt; are not required to produce the phenomena, if multiple mechanisms are at
&gt;&gt; work,
&gt;&gt; it may be that radio waves are one of many ways the phenomena is produced.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Bottom line, with so many options much more information is needed to form
&gt;&gt; any
&gt;&gt; reasonable hypothesis.
