We got references to wolf there weeks ago. In fact it just before you posted about wolf possibly having something to do with a quake. One of the researchers present with us named Maxx is a Native American is referred by others in his tribe as Grey Wolf. You had not yet posted about wolf meaning quake so we thought perhaps the messages we were hearing were for Maxx. It warned of traveling and the wolf.

"Wolf" image. The wolf image tells me a quake is coming, but I never know 
where or when, same as the voices. They try but they said August 11th-and 
China.
