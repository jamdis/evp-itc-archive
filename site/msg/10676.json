It also  logs all the readings on a spreadsheet.  \nYou can also set alarms and  threshholds for spikes, and well as incorporate a \nPC camera or audio device to  record pictures, video or audio whenever your \nalarms are reached.  It&#39;s a  very interesting device.  One of the first \nquestions I asked it was  &quot;Who are you?&quot;  It answered &quot;Edison, reincarnation&quot;.   I \nbrought  it to a meeting today of the group I belong to, the San Francisco Ghost \nSociety,  and when our resident psychic asked it &quot;What&#39;s my name?&quot;  It replied \nwith  the word &quot;Medium&quot;.  Like I said, it&#39;s a very interesting device,  \nindeed!  The inventor refers to the device not as an ITC device, but  rather, a ECM \ndevice -- for Environmental Communications Mode, as it is driven  purely from \nenvironmental data alone.  \n \nSharon\n\n\n\n**************Need a new ride?
