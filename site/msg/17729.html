Fiona, I'm not talking about you (whoever you are) and your 11 year old web=
 site.=C2=A0 I'm responding to your comment "I know one person who paid him=
 for a reading; it definitely did not 
involve "hundreds of dollars an hour=
." 

Well, it sounds like that person got a sweet discount from his normal =
prices of $300/hour.

      Hi,



Well, y=

weekend events.  The economy changes, sometimes dramatically, and our fees =
change accordingly.



These days, most of what we do includes paying out-o=
f-pocket for gas or airfare, plus motels of dubious distinction, en route. =
 At about 80% of events, no speaker's fee is involved. (In case you're wond=
ering, the hotel or other meeting rooms where events are hosted... that's w=
here most of the money goes.)



Guest appearances on reality TV shows rare=
ly pay anything at all. (Not such a great "reality"... huh? *chuckle and si=
gh*)  However, a TV appearance is a credential that can (usually just brief=
ly) allow us to charge more for our services.



In boom or bust, we keep d=
oing what we do. We aspire to earn enough when times are good, to keep the =
bills paid when they're not so great.



I don't know anyone in this field =
who wouldn't rather be doing something else, preferably with a steady paych=
eck.  We do this because we can't NOT do it.  If anyone is getting rich in =
this field, I have yet to meet them.



I don't want sympathy, but I also d=
on't want someone digging through my 11+ year old website, finding a page w=
ith my old fees, and deciding I'm doing this for the money. 



I'm on this=
 list to learn about the box, and similar devices.  I want to understand wh=
at they do, why we hear impossibly consistent voices on them, how to improv=
e the results, and what the significance of this is.



I can't remain sile=
nt when someone suggests that a fellow researcher is money motivated.  But =
really, let's get back on-topic.



Sincerely,

Fiona
