<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Couple pretty good files in here, sorry for the cursing file.  That 
makes this more real to me and they know that.  I don&#x27;t believe they 
curse because they don&#x27;t like me, i think they know i post the audio 
for others to hear and want to prove their existence.  I also got 
the &quot;Are We Dead?&quot; file.  That maybe the first clear message that&#x27;s 
relevant to what we are doing, it must be grounded spirits asking 
that.  If anyone has any thoughts of who would say that, it may be 
another discussion.  Maybe it&#x27;s not grounded spirits, but whom than?
