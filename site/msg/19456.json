I told hubby it would run around $200.00. I must&#39;ve seen something that wasn&#39;t 3. Maybe Spectrecam 1 or 2? I&#39;d LOVE to have a &quot;3&quot;. If I have to buy everything separate, it will  probably run over $400.00. I know my husband can&#39;t afford that. He was really slurging with a $200.00 camera.\n\nYou definately have me wanting one of these now though.
