Recently, Juli posted a Box Log Sheet in her file, that can be used for EVP sessions.  I want to thank Juli here for the post and to say I have been using the form to help me to organize my sessions.  Before the form, I was making notes on scrap paper about my questions, answers, etc. and at times I thought I would remember what went on during a session and would write it up later.  The results were....well...disorganization.  
   
  When I began using Juli's form, my sessions improved.  I had my questions written down before the session, which I think will help both sides of the communication becasue it keeps me from just grabbing my equipment and running off without prior thought.  I made a space on her form for recording notes so I know exactly where a question comes in a session and any response I that I think I heard.  In short I really feel more organized.  
   
  Since I am in a situation where I get week signals and I patch directly in to my recorder, it is important to me to be able to record the data from my recorder while I am recording.  For this reason I have changed Juli's form to include 10 questions and a place to log recording settings for each question.  This way I have a log of all sessions, questions and answers which I can refer to at any time without turning on my recorder and sorting through many minutes of recordings.  
   
  I also reduced the form to 1/2 page to save paper.  I have attached the modified form. Maybe it will useful to someone else.  Thanks again Juli.   Ron L
