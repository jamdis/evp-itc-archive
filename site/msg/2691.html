<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve logged on here but just popping in to 
say hi gang! Glad that y&#x27;all are here!

I saw some information in another ITC forum about DC Six, an audio 
editor that allows one to record EVP in Real Time... and it&#x27;s 
awesome! Has anyone here tried out the demo version of this program 
that&#x27;s now been updated to DC Seven? 

Anyway, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with it and it&#x27;s really amazing. I 
can talk into it and some of my EVP contacts answer back right away. 
But because I am not knowledgeable about sound recorders except for 
the basics when it comes to editing my EVP, I would like to know if 
someone here could download the 10 day trial version of DC Seven and 
let me know what you think about it. I&#x27;m having a few problems with 
getting it to work as it&#x27;s probably supposed to work... mainly having 
a problem with feedback and so on.. 
Here&#x27;s the link to DC Seven&#x27;s 10 trial demo:

Hope someone here will try it out because I would love to know if it 
works for you!
