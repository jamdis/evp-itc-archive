Hey Zack:
                =
  I have had the schematics for about 2 years now, but I am not mechanical =
inclined myself to build one.  I have strong convictions regarding the boxe=
s, having been up close and personal (shall we say) on several different oc=
casions.  I have analyzed EVP from many locations and still strongly believ=
e that the box does not work for everyone.  I believe that your intentions =
are good giving our conversations in the past and wish you the very best wi=
th assembly.
 
See, I believe that the guilds know what your intentions are=
, and the sincerity behind your work and come through to those who have the=
ir best interest at heart.  I know that you probably think I am crazy, but =
in viewing some who currently posses the devices and having changed their p=
ath for their own agenda, its not going to be what they in vision it to be.=
  I think they could open Pandora Box and the world in which they know it w=
ill come crashing down upon their own accord.
 
I know the other side knows=
, and will help those in furthering their studies as they see fit.  I can o=
nly say, that the respect I have for the boxes and Frank will always remain=
, and I can lay my head upon my pillow at night with my integrity in take. =
 When I should have a box, I will know, and until then, I have the pleasure=
 to listen and read everyones data and studies!
