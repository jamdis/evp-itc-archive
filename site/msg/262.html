From my experience, I get better evps if I'm holding the tape recorder in m=
y non dominant hand (left). I think our energy is used to help make the con=
nection, if it's harder for them to get through.  

Sometimes that is not n=
eeded though, and I've heard awesome class A's while the experimenter was n=
ot even present.  But again from my experience I have better luck if I play=
 a part in the session.
