<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello, Lyn.

Have you ever read anything on poltergeists?

One of the most common signs of a poltergeist &quot;visit&quot; (if you will) 
is the movement of objects. Less common but still a sign of a 
possible poltergeist is a disembodied voice or voices.

Now - I&#x27;m not saying you have a poltergeist &quot;visitation&quot; (in fact - 
another common sign is that the phenomenon is short-lived...a few 
months...not an extended length of time like yours) but if you do - 
you&#x27;ll find that the phenomenon takes on the personality of a 
trickster/practical joker. Due to this &quot;personality&quot; - it becomes 
difficult, even impossible to &quot;catch&quot; anything using sound recorders, 
still cameras, video, etc. As if &quot;it&quot; or &quot;they&quot; don&#x27;t want evidence 
of &quot;their&quot; existence just to frustrate/annoy the people 
being &quot;visited&quot;.

One of the most popular theories concerning poltergeists is 
that &quot;they&quot; are not really spirits but the outward manifestation of 
frustration/anger/confusion of a real person (possibly even more than 
one) in the house...known as the &quot;agent&quot;. The agent is creating the 
phenomena subconsciously using psychokinesis (commonly called &quot;mind 
over matter&quot;) so the theory is called RSPK for Recurrent Spontaneous 
PsychoKinesis.

Do you have at least one adolescent in the house who is undergoing 
puberty?

One of the most famous poltergeist cases involving nearly every known 
sign of poltergeist activity such as moving objects AND voices was 
the Enfield Poltergeist case back in the late &#x27;70s. You might be 
fascinated to read up on the case at this web site:

http://www.zurichmansion.org/ghosts/poltergeist.htm

In the meantime - as long as no one gets hurt and your household is 
not totally disrupted by this...I&#x27;d say just accept it and go on with 
your lives.

Hope that helps you somewhat.

Guy

&gt; well so far,   the voices call our name when we are either watching 
tv,
&gt; working on the computer or trying to sleep.
&gt; they call the cats too, and the cats go running to them.
&gt; they are crystal clear voices, and just come about at the oddest 
times.,
&gt; but they call family members by name.  they usually are behind the
&gt; person....and will then call their name.   its become a running 
joke in our
&gt; family now  as this has gone on for 10 years.
&gt; I bought a voice activated tape recorder... in hopes of capturing 
this on
&gt; tape. but no luck yet,.
&gt; I was told to take Pics around the house to look for orbs and 
such.  we have
&gt; never &#x27;seen&#x27; anything, but we&#x27;ve seen activity,  books that get 
picked up
&gt; off the shelf, suspend in air and then drop to the floor (that one 
scared my
&gt; son &amp; I as we were eatchign tv when it happened), doors that open 
and close
&gt; thru out the day &amp; night when I am only one home.
&gt; chair cushions that were yanked down while I sat there and watched 
it... and
&gt; the one that surprised us all is our house has an odd freestanding 
fireplace
&gt; with a round platform with white rocks.   something kicked the 
rocks one
&gt; evening while we watched tv, and the rocks flew across the room.___
&gt; I  was impress in ghost hunters and how they captured voices on 
recorders.
&gt; and thought that might help us solve this.    we dont have ghosts, 
we dont
&gt; have orbs,m we just have something that calls us by name, calls the 
cats,
&gt; and moves things in the house.
