&gt;&gt;    What it is RJ, is there are too many people talking all at once on
&gt;&gt; this, and not only that but, there is also the reverse side, they can start
&gt;&gt; something on one side, and carry on with the reverse side, it is usually
&gt;&gt; where the voice left off, so one must go back to where it was heard, and
&gt;&gt; reverse it.  I don&#x27;t think spirit is omnipresent, they are not God or Holy
&gt;&gt; Spirit, maybe they can&#x27;t see everywhere, but only make guesses, like most
&gt;&gt; people do, unless they have some necessary information to give, like the
&gt;&gt; ones with the info. on the missing girl last year.  So, I don&#x27;t know what to
&gt;&gt; tell you, maybe, they don&#x27;t know where you live etc..sf

&gt;&gt;  So far, your claims that this is not possible are holding true.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   DAH! again. There&#x27;s way to much expectation created in trying to guess,
&gt;&gt; so participants minds interfere with whatever spirit communication there
&gt;&gt; might be. You do not understand how this communcations works, nor do you
&gt;&gt; understand the effects of the observer, you can not seperate the observer
&gt;&gt; from the event in the pararnormal.  therefore any results are
&gt;&gt; invalid--before you go puffing your chest out thinking how clever you are in
&gt;&gt; debunking spirit communication. Even your own expectation that no valid
&gt;&gt; information will be received is enough to block all information. But as
&gt;&gt; usual, skeptic/debunker ignore all!
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  Thanks to everyone who participated in Experiment 2.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; On Friday, 7/16/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer monitor,
&gt;&gt;&gt; right in front of me, and left it there until noon Denver time on Monday,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 7/19/2010. This experiment asked for participants to determine what that
&gt;&gt;&gt; object was. Vague or partial answers would not be counted (for example, just
&gt;&gt;&gt; giving a color, shape, size, what it&#x27;s made of, etc): we&#x27;re looking for what
&gt;&gt;&gt; it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#x27;t count.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means
&gt;&gt;&gt; they chose.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the object at the start
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this
&gt;&gt;&gt; group. The idea with this file is that you could download it at the
&gt;&gt;&gt; beginning of the experiment and &#x27;keep it safe&#x27; on your computer. Then at the
&gt;&gt;&gt; end of the experiment, I would post the password so you can reveal the
&gt;&gt;&gt; contents of the file. That way, you were in control of the original image
&gt;&gt;&gt; during the entire time, not me.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Passworded pdf: http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/
&gt;&gt;&gt; RJ/RJ20100716. pdf&lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.pdf&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The password for that file is: 2plus2isFour
&gt;&gt;&gt; Instructions, if you need them for the other files, are also in that RJ
&gt;&gt;&gt; folder.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; So to the results:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Number of participants: 6
&gt;&gt;&gt; Total tries: 29
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ambiguous answers: 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; Correct answers: 0
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Object: Chair
&gt;&gt;&gt; Object picture: http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/
&gt;&gt;&gt; RJ/RJ20100716. jpg&lt;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100716.jpg&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; As a little side experiment, on Monday I also asked if anyone had gotten
&gt;&gt;&gt; any answers that might indicate an article of clothing (though I did not say
&gt;&gt;&gt; why I was asking). One theory is that the human operator can be influenced
&gt;&gt;&gt; by things they already know or suspect, and so interpret audio with their
&gt;&gt;&gt; own personal &#x27;educated guesses&#x27;, that would differ from what they would hear
&gt;&gt;&gt; had they not known those things. This side experiment did indicate some
&gt;&gt;&gt; support for that theory, since before I mentioned &#x27;articles of clothing&#x27;, no
&gt;&gt;&gt; one included an article of clothing in their results. But after I mentioned
&gt;&gt;&gt; it, several reports of clothing began to appear. I did not add these tries
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the results above.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let
&gt;&gt;&gt; me know. Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this experiment.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
