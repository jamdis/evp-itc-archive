Elabeth,
 
I have A LOT OF TOYS at this time.  Which I am sure a lot of other  
paranormal investigators have as well.  I am not selling this unit because  it does not 
work but because it does work and I have lots of other toys and  boxes that 
work as well.  I also have a few other boxes that I will be  selling and maybe 
listing on Ebay as well.  And I just recently went on an  investigation at 
Eastern State Penn and I had so much equipment there and not  enough hands or 
body to carry it, LOL.  So I do not want to put myself in  that position oagain.
 
Jeff

I'll ask some local ghost hunters I know if they'd be interested  and
pass along your email addy. If you get great responses then why  sell
it? I know they're gonna ask. haha I'd keep the toys that work  well.
I'm sure the editing did cut out some waiting around etc., and  I
haven't read Ryan's blog about the episode yet. He will usually  say
something about it there if the editing is done to make something  seem
more than what it was and I've seen him express concern  about
production things there before, so I think he'll mention it if  the
footage was heavily edited.
