Bruce, have you been able to contact your personal friends and family members yet? Also how do you build this initial bond with the regular spirits you contact. For example, how did you make your first friendship? What started your conversation/interest in the spirit? Did they contact you and what was the initial topic of conversation, first timemeeting, and what do you talk about each time there after?
