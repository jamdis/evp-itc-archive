<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi everyone!  I&#x27;m new here, though I know of some of you from other 
boards, IAH, Haunted Times, etc.

I am Amy from Staten Island Paranormal Society.  I just got to meet 
Chris Moon this weekend and got to experience &quot;Frank&#x27;s box&quot;!  It was 
amazing!  The box actually asked for me by name and told us about 
papers that are supposedly hidden in the house.  Frank, I just have 
to say, &quot;WOW&quot;!!  

Yesterday we went to try to find them, but the one floorboard we 
managed to get up didn&#x27;t have any papers in it.  Because it is a 
historical location, we can&#x27;t rip up the entire floor, though we&#x27;d 
love to! LOL!!

Has anyone successfully been able to contact the people who came 
through on the box in another method, say through their digital 
recorders?  I&#x27;d like to try to get more specific instructions 
from &quot;Jonathan&quot; on where the papers may be.  The director seems to 
feel strongly that these papers are really there.
