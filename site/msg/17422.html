<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>AA-EVP aka Association Transcommunication--Everytime some science oriented
person or organization is asked about the boxes, or the results, the
answer--Oh, it&#x27;s being analyzed. What, they send to recordings to the
national EVP reporting center at Langley!? They can&#x27;t make the box go away,
so they pretend to be studying it. Heard it about a hundred times already.
It&#x27;s BS. Thousands get meaningful two way communication through the box, and
yet somehow it&#x27;s just not good enough, no one can be trusted and all must be
liars and/or crazy.

 I was in AA-EVP when I first started the box, and their take was it wasn&#x27;t
possible to make an EVP receiver. Same old crap, everything is already known
and explained.

 Common sense does not mean rejecting some concept because it does not fit
into cherriesh beliefs! Where is the science in that!? You already know this
is impossible, so no one is allowed ot discuss it, or experiment wiht it, or
present results.

 Everyone wonders why I get fed up. Just ranting now.

&gt; Obviously this needs to be studied by science, I haven&#x27;t seen anyone argue
&gt; differently. ITC in general has been attacked since Jurgenson. When
&gt; Konstantin Raudive went into the shielded control room of Pye Studios and
&gt; recorded EVP&#x27;s, it still wasn&#x27;t good enough for &quot;science.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Fact is, as I alluded to earlier in the post you so graciously &quot;skimmed,&quot;
&gt; science is not studying this. Real two way communication through frequency
&gt; sweeping radio has only come to light less than nine years ago.
&gt;
&gt; What scientists do you think would study this? What lab would take on the
&gt; Ghost Boxes as a project? The answer: none. Why? Because there is no way a
&gt; project like this could get funding. Also, if any reputed lab did study this
&gt; and found out that there might be something to it, and then published about
&gt; it, any scientists involved with that lab would be black listed from future
&gt; projects just do to the incendiary nature of exploring the paranormal.
&gt;
&gt; So it is up to independent people to work on this stuff right now, which,
&gt; as stated earlier, is in its absolute infancy as an ITC device. The fact is
&gt; that there are many people who use these boxes and if they do it at all
&gt; seriously, then they get results...some of which are indicative of some
&gt; intelligence trying to communicate with us.
&gt;
&gt; Association Transcommunication (Formerly AA-EVP) has recently embarked upon
&gt; a study of ghost boxes, but the results are not yet available because they
&gt; are being examined and the results interpreted. If they post something
&gt; positive (white papers are always available on their site), would that
&gt; constitute proof for you? These guys are going to be the closest thing to
&gt; unbiased research that you will find in the field and their reputation is
&gt; impeccable.
&gt;
&gt; http://atransc.org/journal/radiosweep_study.htm
&gt;
&gt; For the rest of us, we do not have labs, nor the equipment to do the
&gt; rigorous science you call for to find the proof. Most of us have no idea how
&gt; electronics, physics, or energy waves work. We accept that, we just know
&gt; that our boxes work. This is the same as turning on a light bulb...we don&#x27;t
&gt; know diddly about how electrons fire or electricity is generated, but I&#x27;ll
&gt; be damned if there isn&#x27;t a light while I&#x27;m typing this and it works.
&gt;
&gt; Would you please answer a two-part question for my own edification?
&gt;
&gt; What would you consider proof, and how can evidential proof be presented to
&gt; you so it will not be in question?
&gt;
&gt; And yes, you figured out the big secret: we are a cult. Too bad you won&#x27;t
&gt; drink the Kool-Aid with us.

&gt; &gt; Yes it is a Cult when you don&#x27;t look at common sense and search

&gt; It needs to be studied.

&gt; &gt; I am sorry I missed your posts and I can understand how anyone would see

&gt; &gt; Insults? You are the one who posts insults. Frank&#x27;s reply to an
&gt; email,(addressed to him by the way), was not addressed to you. But, you felt
&gt; it necessary to respond with a snide, cryptic remark.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You state you are here to find &quot;the truth&quot;.? Have you ever tried to
&gt; communicate with a spirit box? Are you a Paranormal Investigator? I haven&#x27;t
&gt; seen any posts where you offer any information about your beliefs.
&gt; &gt; Â I responded to your post last week and you ignored me. This is a group
&gt; of &quot;like minded &quot;people who discuss RTSC sessions and share findings we
&gt; others. We exchange ideas and offer help to one another in our search for
&gt; answers. Â Your snide snippets only serve to demean others . Â
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Now that I have explained my position, you can now accuse me of slinging
&gt; insults and being part of a cult.!

&gt; &gt; &gt;Read the one that was posted before mine.Â  I am here to see if there is
&gt; any truth to this.Â  As stated previously, many times, and by your

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;And that is not childish at all.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;If you have a point to make, please do so.Â  And while you are at it
&gt; stop with the insults, because that is childish also.Â  I have stated my
&gt; reason for being here several timesÂ before in the past and I harbor no ill
&gt; will to anyone.Â  but I might if you keep it up!Â  Is that what you want?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I want hard evidence, irrefutable evidence, not excuses or wishes or
&gt; could be&#x27;s.Â  I want facts.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I want nothing more and nothing less.Â  That is the cold hardÂ truth of
&gt; it all, the ugly necked truth that no one wants to look at.Â  And if you
&gt; want to throw rocks at me, that is fine.Â  I am a very big person.Â  But the
&gt; question will remain the same, with me or without me.Â  Lambaste me to
&gt; Hattie&#x27;s, it will not changeÂ one damnÂ thing.Â  That question will still be
&gt; there.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I would like to sayÂ and give a thank you to Snowflake for the kind
