&gt; Your points are valid and being human beings we tend to be more
&gt; emotional and immature than logical. I wish everyone would end this  
&gt; nonsense including myself
&gt; and get on with the research and development. chris has voiced his  
&gt; opinion and we have voiced ours
&gt; so lets put it to bed and move forward. I for one will not respond  
&gt; to any more malicious posts from one side
&gt; or the other. If anyone wants me I&#x27;ll be conducting research.

&gt; Chris has done more to further the research of Franks Box than
&gt; any other individual. Agree, disagree it doesn&#x27;t matter! That fact is
&gt; when the book is written on the ITC and how it was perfected. Frank
&gt; and Chris will have the first and second chapters dedicated to them.
&gt;
&gt; No matter what side of this argument you come down on there will
&gt; always be different opinions. ITC Paranormal research may be in vogue
&gt; but the idea&#x27;s certainly are not new.
&gt;
&gt; However, we now stand at the apex of this ride. The gates are open.
&gt; The throttle is stuck, crash or survive we&#x27;re in it till the end. Go
&gt; away!, don&#x27;t read, don&#x27;t try,it won&#x27;t matter! This ride has left! Even
&gt; jumping off won&#x27;t stop it.
&gt;
&gt; We are now going to see an explosion of new idea&#x27;s. But that&#x27;s what it
&gt; takes! People have to take sides, someone has to be right , someone
&gt; has to be wrong. Without both sides there&#x27;s no advancement.
&gt; I read &quot;too many posts&quot; I hate fence sitters either you&#x27;re in or
&gt; you&#x27;re out . But learn to smile and say thank you.
&gt;
&gt; Here&#x27;s the way it is. You say I&#x27;m wrong OK!. Thank you very much!
&gt; And I go about my business of doing what I want to do, there&#x27;s truth
&gt; to every side of an argument. Just take what is constructive and file
&gt; the rest. Just say Thank You!
&gt;
&gt; PS.
&gt; To that individual who wrote me claiming to be from the Catholic Arch
&gt; diocesi I doubt very much that the Catholic Church uses hot mail ...
&gt; oh it&#x27;s Catholic Archdiocese LMAO
&gt;
&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
