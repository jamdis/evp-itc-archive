           I have posted a log sheet if you want to use it in the file sect=
ion. This may also help in aiding you with your sessions.  Just remember on=
ce your rock n rolling your questions along with their responses just may l=
ead you in a direction you may never intended.  Be quick on your feet, but =
try to preplan if you can.
 
           Also, I always try and ask them if =
they have any questions for me or if I can deliver a message of any kind.  =
I never want them to think that its all about me and getting the informatio=
n I WANT!  You would never have a conversation with a live friend always ta=
king over the topic.  For if that was the case I would not have any friends=
, LOL.  
 
          You may also get communication for only you to hear, i=
n which case you may discover that your recorder has been turned off.  I ha=
ve attached a clip where I tell them to stop shutting up my recorder and th=
eir response is sarcastic as if they had no clue to what I was talking abou=
t.  I love their sense of humor!
