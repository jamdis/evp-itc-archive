I once believed that I had a so called tec, but I have not heard the voice he identifies himself as in about a month.  I also don&#39;t think that you have to ask any questions at all to get messages that if there is something intended for you to hear or record, you&#39;ll get it.  \n   \n                  I think its ok to ask questions during a session, and unless your answers are backed up with factual data (known to be fact) you have to take it at face value.  I would like to believe that what we are getting in the 2 way communication was acturate and truthful, but the fact is, for the most part I can not confirm one way or another.
