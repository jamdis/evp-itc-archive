How true is that.\n\n-Steve \n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Early Cuyler &lt;ecuyler@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Margaret, I can&#39;t argue with what you&#39;ve said.  I&#39;m just saying \nthere are those who take advantage and should have no business in \ndoing so.  One example I can give is Chris Moon.  He charges people \nto do box sessions.  I can&#39;t remember the exact fee, but it&#39;s \noutrageous that he&#39;s doing this, not to mention, he does so with a \nFrank&#39;s box.  He is a self proclaimed medium and I&#39;ve heard from many \nsources that he is nothing but a fake.  \n&gt; \n&gt; So I attribute my frustration with people of this type, but again I \nsay, as long as there are people dumb enough to pay for this, then \nthere will always be those who take advantage.\n&gt; \n&gt; Personally, I feel anyone who is gifted with mediumship or other \nadvanced intuitive abilities should use it as a gift to help others, \nnot for monetary gain.  I&#39;m not being judgmental here, that&#39;s just \nhow I feel.  I have a friend who is also a legitimate medium and I \ndon&#39;t agree that she should use her abilities for gain, but it \ndoesn&#39;t mean I like her any less.  My not liking it won&#39;t change the \nfact that it happens, it&#39;s just the way  things go.   \n&gt; \n&gt; Do I think that Ron is taking advantage of people?  No I don&#39;t.  \nRon says he uses the best parts available and that the cost of the \nMinibox is very close to what it costs to manufacture it.  How close, \nI have no idea.  On the other hand, I don&#39;t own one as I think $399 \nor $449 for the &quot;crystal enhanced version,&quot; is a lot to pay for a \ndevice that, from what I&#39;ve heard, produces the same results as a \nRadio Shack radio for $25-$40.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Jeremy\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; From: itcdeadpeople &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, April 5, 2008 1:32:28 PM\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: boxes on ebay\n&gt; \n&gt;                 Hi Jeremy.  If everyone knew about these support \nboards and that other resources are \n&gt; available to them, that would be one thing.  Obviously everyone \nhere is aware of that.  But \n&gt; not everyone knows this place exists.  \n&gt; \n&gt; And even if they do know about the boards here, how many would have \nthe nerve to ask \n&gt; for help from strangers?  As Bruce recently shared, he gives people \ninvitations to contact \n&gt; him privately in case they are too shy just ask a question \npublicly.  Which means, by the \n&gt; way, to some degree they have overcome some of that shyness in \norder to post whatever it \n&gt; was to begin with, which inspired him to make this offer.  What if \nthey don&#39;t even have the \n&gt; gumption to be anything more than be a look-i-loo?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m guessing many people are just surfing the net, checking out \nparanormal stuff, and run \n&gt; across the hacked boxes for sale.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Again, I ask people who are taking the position you and Bruce are \nregarding profits ... do \n&gt; you have this same harsh sentiment toward Ron Ricketts, who makes \nand sells the \n&gt; MiniBoxes?  I realize he is passionate about this research and \nhelping others.  Does that \n&gt; give him amnesty for making a profit?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Personally I think we need to not be so judgmental.  At what point \ndoes &quot;profitable gain in \n&gt; the paranormal field&quot; become &quot;sickening?&quot;  I have a friend who is a \nmedium.  I mean THE \n&gt; REAL DEAL.  He charges for his services.   The fee is reasonable \ncompared to many in his \n&gt; field.  Does he do this because he&#39;s a terrible person looking to \ntake advantage of people?  \n&gt; NO, he does so because he has been given a gift that changes \npeople&#39;s lives for the better.  \n&gt; But he has to make a living... has to support himself in some way.  \nAnd because he has \n&gt; chosen to provide this service full time (and is not a trust fund \nbaby), he makes a profit.  \n&gt; This allows him to help far more people than he could if working \nsome other kind of job \n&gt; and providing his services at no cost on the side.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I realize this is not exactly the same thing as gouging people on \nthe price for a \n&gt; commercially available product, but making such blanket statements \nabout profitability in \n&gt; the paranormal field being sickening is rather short-sighted, in my \nopinion.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I have a southern friend who likes to say, &quot;It&#39;s a mighty thin \nplank that ain&#39;t got two sides.&quot;  \n&gt; I just don&#39;t think we have the right to claim that simply because \nsomeone is offering a \n&gt; good and or service for profit to consumers in the paranormal \nmarket, that this \n&gt; automatically means they are taking advantage of other&#39;s \nvulnerabilities.  \n&gt; \n&gt; For Pete&#39;s sake, no one is twisting the people&#39;s arms to buy those \nunits on eBay.  They are \n&gt; perfectly free to buy from whatever source they choose.  Since the \nunits do work as \n&gt; claimed, we can argue that people have overpaid, shopped unwisely, \nor whatever.  I assure \n&gt; you this happens every single day throughout the retail market \nplace with all types of \n&gt; products and services.    \n&gt; \n&gt; I will say I have a fairly heathy dose of distain for \ncharlatans/scam artists (of any flavor in \n&gt; any field) but that is not what we are talking about here.  We are \ntalking about people who \n&gt; are offering legitimate products to consumers.  I&#39;d rather see \npeople doing this for profit, \n&gt; even when obscene, than running scams that damage people&#39;s \nphysical, mental, and/or \n&gt; financial well-being.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Early Cuyler &lt;ecuyler@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Very well put, Bruce.  Profitable gain in the paranormal field is \nsickening..  Unfortunately, \n&gt; there are those who continue to support the ones profiting, so it \nwill continue.  It makes \n&gt; me sick that people take advantage of others vulnerabilities, \nespecially when it comes to \n&gt; spiritual matters, but that&#39;s a rant for another time and place.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If someone is afraid to try hacking a radio or lacks the proper \ntools, they are more than \n&gt; welcome to send them to me and I&#39;ll do it for them and ship it \nback.  As Bruce said, it&#39;s not \n&gt; for recognition, but it&#39;s to help further the research.  I wouldn&#39;t \nbe doing this research if it \n&gt; wasn&#39;t for Frank, Bruce, Steve and the others who put in their time \nand effort.  The \n&gt; possibilities are only limited by our willingness to work \ntogether.
