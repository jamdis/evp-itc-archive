&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   Just my two cents and input based on what I get from my ancestral guides
&gt; and guardians...
&gt;
&gt; The spiritual dimension and those who reside there do not perceive &quot;time&quot;
&gt; as we do in the typical linear fashion. Remember the saying, *&quot;In the
&gt; twinkling of an eye?&quot;*
&gt;
&gt; 10,000 years here may only seem like a few precious moments over there, and
&gt; vice versa.
&gt;
&gt; They also remind me of the quantum field, string theory, our holographic
&gt; Universe (etc) and that *ALL time is &quot;ticking&quot;* (past, present &amp; future)
&gt; at the very same moment. It&#x27;s all happening RIGHT NOW in various levels,
&gt; layers, alternative realities and spiritual/energetic dimensions.
&gt;
&gt; The end of the Earth has already happened (for them and us!) in many ways.
&gt; Depending on who you&#x27;re speaking to, some even describe *what it was like*when the planet Earth was destroyed, speaking as though it has/had already
&gt; occured. There would also be dimensions in which this event has already
&gt; occured thousands of years ago, 5 minutes ago, 3 days from now and 10,000
&gt; years into the future and every other possible scenario.
&gt;
&gt; So which one is the RIGHT one then?
&gt;
&gt; Well, I think they all are.
&gt;
&gt; Because &quot;they&quot; live in a world of &quot;source energy&quot;, light, consciousness and
&gt; perfect information fields...one that&#x27;s so completely and totally different
&gt; to our own experience here/now and are not limited by linear time and
&gt; local/non-local space or relativity like we are, it&#x27;s likely very difficult
&gt; for most of the beings we would speak to through the box to give us specific
&gt; information regarding such an event or the exact time (or even &quot;which Earth&quot;
&gt; they are referencing, dimensionally speaking!).
&gt;
&gt; In other words, they don&#x27;t experience any of this stuff (and
&gt; especially &quot;time&quot;) like we do.
&gt;
&gt; To end, for several years now I&#x27;ve been a devoted care-giver to the ancient
&gt; quartz crystal skulls of Mayan legend and much of the mythologies and
&gt; folklore surrounding these objects is focused around 2012 and the
&gt; impending Great Shift. I&#x27;ve also studied South American culture (past and
&gt; present), anthropology, folklore and tribal customs along with their
&gt; indigenous wisdom systems in varying depth with the Kogi Indians, Quechua
&gt; Curanderos and residents of the Amazon.
&gt;
&gt; For many years I followed the work of Terence McKenna rather closely and
&gt; Terence is someone I consider a man-genius far ahead of his time (may he
&gt; rest in peace). He developed a time-mapping system based on the I-Ching, the
&gt; Mayan Calendar, Great Pyramids, DMT-beings, fractals, plant
&gt; consciousness and other mathematic systems that showed a sharp spike
&gt; followed by a near-perfect &quot;dip&quot; before it went off the charts and moved
&gt; into &quot;nothingness&quot; completely around December 21st, 2012...and even Terence
&gt; didn&#x27;t think this is when the world would end, necessarily.
&gt;
&gt; (His &quot;official&quot; position is that he simply didn&#x27;t know what to make of it
&gt; or expect. One theory is that his algorithms reflected such a change during
&gt; a time that humanity may have finally broken the time/space barrier and
&gt; uncovered the keys to time travel and 4th dimensional plane-shifting, to
&gt; name just one possible solution.).
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ve also been fortunate enough to live in Swaziland, South Africa with the
&gt; Swazi, Zulu, Xhosa and San Bushmen tribes who (like most other cultures
&gt; throughout time and history) also have their own teachings and mystery
&gt; traditions surrounding
&gt; this and other events.
&gt;
&gt; Given that the San are the most ancient tribal peoples and humanities
&gt; oldest ancestors still living in the world today and whose incredible
&gt; healing knowledge, spiritual wisdoms and mystical practices far exceed any
&gt; I&#x27;ve ever heard of or personally witnessed anywhere else in the world and
&gt; they don&#x27;t seem to feel that life on this planet is going to end anytime
&gt; soon, so I&#x27;m not going to panic just yet.
&gt;
&gt; These amazing people have their ears pressed up very closely to the
&gt; heartbeat and rhythms of Mother Earth and told me firsthand that before the
&gt; end comes certain events will take place on a scale the whole world will be
&gt; instantly made aware of...events that could still take several hundred or
&gt; even thousands of years to unfold.
&gt;
&gt; All I know for my own self, personally, is that I have no clue what&#x27;s going
&gt; to happen...but it will be okay, no matter what takes place. There are worst
&gt; things than dying, believe me...and part of what makes our work with the
&gt; Ghost Box and ITC in general so helpful and inspiring is that we can find a
&gt; level of peace and comfort through our sessions and recordings we might
&gt; actually need one day, whether soon or in some distant time - we&#x27;re all
&gt; going to end up there eventually, no doubt about it!
&gt;
&gt; *FINAL NOTE:* I don&#x27;t have all the answers...I don&#x27;t even have all the
&gt; questions, and I know it. My guess is as good as any and I could be
&gt; completely and totally WRONG about all of this (I&#x27;m open to that and I&#x27;m
&gt; perfectly fine with it). Believe you me, if the world ends when a lot
&gt; of folks think it might I&#x27;ll be just as surprised as anyone. Until then I&#x27;ll
&gt; keep doing what I do now; realizing that I don&#x27;t know a damn thing, taking
&gt; life as it comes to me day by precious day, treating it with respect and
&gt; honoring my experience here as the gift it is, loving others, being good to
&gt; the people around me and enjoying my family and time spent here while I can.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; And I won&#x27;t be afraid...not even for one second or when I&#x27;m looking up and
&gt; seeing that big f***ing rock heading right towards us, hahaha. For all I
&gt; know (or anyone here for that matter), I could be blindsided by a Mac truck
&gt; later this evening!
&gt;
&gt; Many of the people worried over 2012 won&#x27;t even be here when 2012
&gt; arrives...now how&#x27;s THAT for a mind-f**k!?!?
&gt;

&gt; Frank,
&gt;
&gt; Remember last year when we both got the August predictions? That didn&#x27;t pan
&gt; out, so i wouldn&#x27;t take what they say too seriously. They have never said
&gt; anything that came true yet, i don&#x27;t think they can.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m pretty sure that they can&#x27;t tell the future, so when they say stuff i
&gt; think they are just messing with us to see what we do with the information.
&gt; They might even be laughing at us !
