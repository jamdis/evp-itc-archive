After reading Steve&#39;s post it dawned on \nme that he is 1000% right in saying that this has gotten out of hand.\n\nI do not personally know Chris moon and any slurs I have made upon \nhis character I apologize. I do not agree with the statements he made \nabout box research and the people that are doing it, even though I \nmay not agree with what he Say&#39;s but I have shed my blood for his \nright to say it.\n\nto babierz and lance, forgive my fowl language and the name calling \nsometimes my temper runs way ahead of my brain. \n\nin closing let me say it is the Christmas season and I for one will \ntry to adhere to the old saying &quot;good will toward men&quot;\n\nlets continue our research with no animosity.\n\nthanks\nBruce"}
