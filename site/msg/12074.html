<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all,

I&#x27;ve been away for a few weeks now. We are busy putting together our
investigative team. We&#x27;re sponsoring SPOOKS R US radio show on
www.para-x.com, and have been busy investigating and going through
evidence as of late. 

I hope all of you are doing well, and are having lots of fun with your
various projects. I&#x27;m uploading some new EVPs to my folder for you all
to listen to at your leisure. Hope you enjoy them.

If you&#x27;re up for some good live radio programming, head over to
www.para-x.com for live shows on a nightly basis. I know, it sounds
like a plug, but I am absolutely addicted to the network and I know
you&#x27;ll all enjoy it too. They have a chat room where you can interact
with the hosts and other listeners during the shows. They have great
paranormal guests and cover a wide range of topics from the paranormal
field. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll say about it, but it is awesome.

Well, I hope you guys enjoy our EVPs. Let us know what you think!

Chad 
GA.S.P.</pre>
