<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Dear Ms. Abercrombie:

It seems that you misunderstand how some of us react to posts by &quot;RJ.&quot;

It&#x27;s not his (or her) tests that are so troublesome, though they sound a little silly to me.  To me, they&#x27;re rather like someone clearly holding the salt cellar in one hand and asking me, &quot;Which hand has the salt?&quot;

If it&#x27;s a small child asking, that&#x27;s amusing.  If it&#x27;s an adult, it seems a bit insulting.  I don&#x27;t expect the spirits to feel any differently.

But that&#x27;s neither here nor there; the tests are not the issue.

What is troublesome is the rhetoric chosen by RJ. While sarcasm rarely conveys well in text, RJ&#x27;s posts are so dripping with sarcasm, the tone is impossible to overlook.  

Further, arguing over this seems a waste of everyone&#x27;s time.  I doubt that anyone is going to change his or her mind. If this group&#x27;s primary function is to swap insults rather than pool research results and brainstorm new approaches to this science, I should probably leave.

Sincerely,
Fiona Broome

&gt; For the record, I appreciate RJ&#x27;s contribution here, and what he is trying
&gt; to accomplish with these tests. No one should have any problem not the
&gt; skeptics, nor the believers. The outcome of the tests won&#x27;t mean anything to
&gt; anyone except those who wish to remain objective. I do not understand why
&gt; some people here are so threatened by these tests.
