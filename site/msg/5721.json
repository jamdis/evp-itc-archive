This was captured on a digital voice recorder \n&gt; while \n&gt; &gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   was heating coffee in the microwave oven nearby, and I felt \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   microwave must have been a powerful energy source for \n&gt; &gt; the &quot;speaker.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   It may be important to note that I had just invited spirits \n&gt; &gt; inside \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   the house from outside, and that after I listened to this \n&gt; message \n&gt; &gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   told them to go back outside because they were too rude to \n&gt; &gt; continue \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   talking to.

Robin, \nI \n&gt; am \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   glad to hear that the protection ritual will be utilized by \nyou \n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   the purpose it was intended. To give any individual that \nwants \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   anopportunity to use it. You will find many forms of \n&gt; interaction \n&gt; &gt; on \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   this group, running the gamut from total agreement to calm \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   debate /discussion. To full blown arguments. That is what \nmakes \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   group, If everyone followed one single ideology and the ideas \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; any \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   single person without questionit would not be a group it \nwould \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   cult.

When I first started recording EVP a couple \nof \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   years ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when \nit \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   happened to me I felt elated rather than frightened or \n&gt; &gt; distressed. I \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   will ask again: What physical or psychic harm is a \ndisembodied \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   entity capable of doing? Please listen to the one EVP I&#39;ve \n&gt; posted \n&gt; &gt; on \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   this board and tell me what, if anything, you hear. I know \nwhat \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   hear, and I consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   response that has created the determination in me to continue \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   researching the unknown. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings. I only want to learn \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   much as I can from you and the other dedicated researchers on \n&gt; &gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   board. It never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   past, and that&#39;s about all I can say. I will probably use one \n&gt; &gt; from \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   this point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   goodness. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; So, thank you for this contribution. I think the debate has \n&gt; &gt; been \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   an excellent one, and I&#39;ve appreciated the opportunity to be \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   enlightened.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Robin\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; From: bhali333 \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%\n40yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 16, 2008 8:06 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debate\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; I swore I would not get wraped up in this debateBUT!The \n&gt; reason \n&gt; &gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   came up with this whole protection ritual was that some of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; new \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   researchers whereexpressing a rational concern for negative \n&gt; &gt; responces \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   that they were recieving through thier boxes.The short \n&gt; protection \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   ritual that I posted is not meant to quell irrational \n&gt; histerical \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   fear, and I agreewith rosemary that anyone suffering from \nsuch \n&gt; &gt; fear \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   should rethink thier involment in the paranormal research \n&gt; &gt; field.that \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   being said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal \ncomfort \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   those new individuals that had never expperienced spiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   negativity. And to help ease them into aproaching a session \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   eventually with confidenceand determination as well as full \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   curiousity for all types of the communication we recieve.My \n&gt; &gt; initial \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   post of the ritual file was done with the best of intentions \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   meant to be another tool available for those who felt they \n&gt; needed \n&gt; &gt; or \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer ritual, I \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   think it is really worthy of all this debate.Use it, don&#39;t \nuse \n&gt; &gt; it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   It&#39;s there if you want it. Also I must say there are two \nkinds \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   fear the kind that is natural and a god given emotion for \nself \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   preservation, ie the fright and flight reflex that is an \n&gt; &gt; instinctive \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   trait in all of us. Then you have the irrational dibilitating \n&gt; &gt; phobic \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   fear that can turn an individual into a frozen statue. That \n&gt; type \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   fear I believe is unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   learned how to harness. I also believe that anyone that \nharbors \n&gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   type of fear would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and \nin \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   case of such fear it would already be present and doing a \nsmall \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   protection ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   what it is, something to utilize in our box of tools like an \n&gt; emf \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   meter.you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the \nbottom \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   your tool box at home that you inherited from your \ngrandfather \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   have never usedbut if you come across that odd nut that needs \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   tightening somedsy you will be glad you have it.Bruce\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Need to know the score, the latest news, or you need your \n&gt; &gt; Hotmail-\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   get your &quot;fix&quot; Check it out. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Climb to the top of the charts!
