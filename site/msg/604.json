All of it is helpful and we&#39;ll follow up in our group. Hopefully we&#39;ll have some results worthy of posting. Frank, the MIB image is amazing and I&#39;ve wondered about it&#39;s origin for a while. And Misty, your specific technique suggestions are appreciated.\n   \n  I still would like to see stats on ITC recording accummulated. We reviewed some EVP data presented by Alexander MacRae which I found very interesting during the AAEVP Conference in Atlanta. Although limited to his own work, he had duration, time of day, number of words, etc. averaged in an easy to follow Power Point type of slide show. Although I need no further convincing of the validity of EVP recording in a general sense, I find in useful to document the basic facts pertaining to paranormal recording and I feel it would be useful to include ITC data. This information may be useful to other researchers hoping for successful recording. And as the science of recording this phenomenon reaches the university level, it may be helpful in an effort to establish consistent methods. To move from theory (from the skeptics point of view) to accepted fact, being able to get similar results under similar recording conditions is usually required.\n   \n  -Bill    \n\r\n--0-272673054-1167209096=:11404\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Frank and Misty, thanks for the responses.
