Why take the attitude " i am just gonna ignore his responses and keep doing=
 what i am doing".=A0 If you're trying to be a researcher, you need to look=
 under all the rocks, listen to all the opinions, be ready to back up your =
claims, or to change your mind. 

Saying " i am just gonna ignore his respo=
nses" moves you more out of the path of researcher, and more into the path =
of something akin to religious belief, or to the worst kind of debunker: on=
e who will not consider other opinions.

      here was some replys from my team member who consi=
ders himself our de-bunker:



The one pertaining to "He wouldn't kill" her=
e was his reply:



"doesnt sound like "he wouldn't kill" sounds like " he =
wont show ?(her) it was cut off.

anyway why would we call this an evp?"


=

This was his response to the one where we asked what happened when they tr=
ied to escape and got the response "da pit"



He says:"this one sound like=
 a sports radio frequency "the Pitt" sburgh Penquins. I hear do "back off".=


example of just radio chatter scanning, to me. would you submit as eviden=
ce?"



The one where we asked about how to get thru the steel bars and woo=
d and we get the "Take ur file" as a response, my team member who isn't buy=
ing any of this replys:

"I slowed end down sounds like "take your final" o=
r "findings could be talking college radio, who knows, its radio frequencie=
s"



by the way after i slowed the same file down i noticed it comes thru =
between 6-8 different clicks on 12-469 radio on the am channel.  AS we all =
know that would equal about 6-8 different channels.  what is the chances of=
 getting an understandable phrase in the same tone of voice across that man=
y channels... i should pose that response back to him and see what his de-b=
unking result would be?



I guess he's intitled to his own opinion, i am j=
ust gonna ignore his responses and keep doing what i am doing.  Thanks for =
the support and knowledge!
