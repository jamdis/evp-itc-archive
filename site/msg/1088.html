<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I tried this idea (direct flame modulation) over a year ago. The trouble is, to maintain a microphonic flame the flame is rather small in size. When I introduce probes or wires to the flame is disrupts the microphone effect. Also direct modulation of the flame with an AC signal does not seem to reproduce on the phototransistor receiver. This doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be done, just that I never came across the right combo to make it work.
Good thinking,

Dave


&quot; i wonder what they dont like? just a retarded idea but &quot;maybe it would be more appetizing if the output from sweep was integrated with flame, like by putting output from sweep into flame with little plate or something&quot;</pre>
