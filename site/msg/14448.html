True.

Being a paranormal investigator, I do understand why colleges have t=
o be like that though. Just like when I am on investigations, I have to sti=
ck to just the proven facts. I can't just believe something, as that is sub=
jective. That doesn't mean that in my head I am not drawing my own conclusi=
ons based on what I believe, but I just have to keep that part of it to mys=
elf.

Colleges can't really teach you about unproven terms and ideologies. =
They can talk about them, but can't really teach you them, as they haven't =
been proven to exist, therefore there is no correct way.

Just like paranor=
mal investigating. There is no right or wrong way to do it as the field has=
 not been proven to exist.
