The \nAAEVP/Sarah Estep Research Fund is not for AAEVP to  do the research, it&#39;s for \nthem to fund OUTSIDE organizations for  THEIR scientific research on the study \nof EVP. The Windbridge  Institute received some of this sponsor money for \nwhat they called  &quot;Real-time EVP Conversations: A Pilot Study.&quot; The method \nfor this  communication was *not* based on radio sweep, nor traditional  \nmethods, so it&#39;s not based on what I assume many people here are  doing. And in \nfact, it *was* based on the creations of someone  outside of the USA, so I&#39;m \na little confused as to why all the  hostility toward AAEVP for putting up \nthe money.\n\nSadly, radio  sweep methods don&#39;t, and may not for a long time, get the \nrespect of  the scientific community that it deserves (then again, seems no \nform  of EVP does), but at least this current research is a step in the  right \ndirection. I hope, when Windbridge concludes their study, that  it will \nsupport the notion that there is apparent communication  formed in ways that \ncannot be explained by currently known and  understood laws of nature. THAT \nalone, in my opinion, would be a big  plus for all ITC communities, regardless \nof the method from which  that communication was received. What&#39;s the old \nsaying? &quot;It takes  but one white crow to prove all crows are not black.&quot; Any \nproof,  derived from any EVP method, would be greatly welcomed as far as I&#39;m  \nconcerned.\n\nMargaret  \n\n\n--- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ (mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com) , Frank \nSumption  &lt;purplealiengirl@pur&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s the  same old stuff, everyone wants to completely ignore absolutely  \nall\n&gt; work that has been in this field since the caveman and  act like they just\n&gt; discovered spirit and EVP.

The AAEVP/Sarah Estep Research Fund is =\r\nnot for AAEVP to \n            do the research, it&#39;s for them to fund OUTSID=\r\nE organizations for \n            THEIR scientific research on the study of =\r\nEVP. The Windbridge \n            Institute received some of this sponsor mo=\r\nney for what they called \n            &quot;Real-time EVP Conversations: A Pilot=\r\n Study.&quot; The method for this \n            communication was *not* based on =\r\nradio sweep, nor traditional \n            methods, so it&#39;s not based on wha=\r\nt I assume many people here are \n            doing. And in fact, it *was* b=\r\nased on the creations of someone \n            outside of the USA, so I&#39;m a =\r\nlittle confused as to why all the \n            hostility toward AAEVP for p=\r\nutting up the money.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sadly, radio \n            sweep methods don&#39;t, =\r\nand may not for a long time, get the respect of \n            the scientific=\r\n community that it deserves (then again, seems no form \n            of EVP =\r\ndoes), but at least this current research is a step in the \n            rig=\r\nht direction. I hope, when Windbridge concludes their study, that \n        =\r\n    it will support the notion that there is apparent communication \n      =\r\n      formed in ways that cannot be explained by currently known and \n     =\r\n       understood laws of nature. THAT alone, in my opinion, would be a big=\r\n \n            plus for all ITC communities, regardless of the method from w=\r\nhich \n            that communication was received. What&#39;s the old saying? &quot;=\r\nIt takes \n            but one white crow to prove all crows are not black.&quot;=\r\n Any proof, \n            derived from any EVP method, would be greatly welc=\r\nomed as far as I&#39;m \n            concerned.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Margaret \n            &lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A title=3Dmailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com \n            hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; \n            target=3D_blank&gt;EVP-ITC=\r\n@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;, Frank Sumption \n            &lt;purplealiengirl@=\r\n&lt;WBR&gt;...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It&#39;s the \n            same old stuff, e=\r\nveryone wants to completely ignore absolutely \n            all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; work=\r\n that has been in this field since the caveman and \n            act like th=\r\ney just&lt;BR&gt;&gt; discovered spirit and EVP.
