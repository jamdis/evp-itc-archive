Some are blatantly obvious and some \nmight be more questionable.\n\nOne thing I have noticed is that it appears when the background is almost \ntotally quiet with just the noise generated by the electronic circuits, an \nEVP might show up but it is so weak that most people can&#39;t hear it. On the \nother hand, it seems that a noise such as a passing car or train can be \nused and modulated by someone to produce a much louder EVP.\n\nI&#39;ve been a radio amateur for 41 years and have been involved in what we \ncall &quot;weak-signal work&quot; for 20 or so. That includes some EME \n(Earth-Moon-Earth, or moonbounce). Many of the signals I try to hear are \nso weak as to be buried in the noise but I&#39;ve trained my ears to be able \nto pull them out.\n\nSo I often hear things in recordings that most people cannot hear. We had \na contest a few years ago where one radio amateur recorded a reception of \na weak EME signal and offered a warm pat on the back to anyone who could \nget the callsign of the station in the recording.  I was one of about 5 \nwho got it while hundreds didn&#39;t. (Note - he had the advantage of knowing \nahead of time who was going to be calling him by prearranged schedule. \nNone of the &quot;contestants&quot; knew that.)\n\nOne that has perplexed me is a recording of an EVP over a phone answering \nmachine that I have.  The noise over the top is so horrendous that it&#39;s \nalmost impossible to pick out what the voice in it is saying.  I did \nmanage to get several words and phrases. EVPmaker couldn&#39;t get anything \nout of it at all.\n\nAnyway, I agree with you that these entities can use background noises to \nbuild voices and sounds on the recordings. That&#39;s been my experience also.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Wed, 12 Nov 2008, Frank Sumption wrote:\n\n&gt; For those &quot;experts&quot; out there that would tell the rest of us what EVP is,\n&gt; and how to do it, a suggestion. Try getting some education first, start with\n&gt; dong some EVP recording open air, then try the various forms of white noise,\n&gt; and other background noises that the entities seemingly use to build voices\n&gt; out of. Then move to EVPmaker-*following the instructions* by using human\n&gt; speech as the &quot;raw&quot; audio. Then proceed to tell what EVP and spirit voices\n&gt; are. or are not. It is rare that spirit respects titles and degrees, and\n&gt; this usually inhibits serious &quot;scientific&quot; research.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW, EVPmaker is a program that runs on Windows machines. It takes a wave\n&gt; (.wav) file of human speech, breaks it up in small chunks, and plays this\n&gt; &quot;raw&quot; audio back through the speakers--randomly, while recording the result.\n&gt; The entities manipulate the data *inside* the computer. For some &quot;reseacher&quot;\n&gt; to claim there is no evidence that the program works only means the\n&gt; researhcer has no idea what he&#39;she is talking about, and comes from a\n&gt; position of complete ignorance. I&#39;m sure that you could place a cpmputer in\n&gt; a faraday cage, and EVPmaker would perform it&#39;s function.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard these &quot;researchers&quot; for years all claiming to be &quot;scientific&quot;\n&gt; while in fact they seek only to debunk, accpeting no evidence, as if they\n&gt; got their degrees after everything knowable has already been discovered.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bottom line, get the voices first, then tell all us unwashed masses what it\n&gt; really is. In the mean time I&#39;ll keep working on my do nothing boxes.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt;"}
