<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>A lot of times the things i&#x27;m thinking do come through onto the radio 
broadcast.  If i think of a question they answer even though i didn&#x27;t 
say anything.  But Evp&#x27;s can be interpreted differently by everyone 
too, mostly people think they hear different things at the same time 
which is frustrating to get a clear answer.  I think that is what we 
are doing here on this board, to keep trying to eventually get a clear 
answer that nobody can argue that it said that.  Better boxes, Better 
theories and ideas on communication, we have a long way to go.  But 
those who stay with it will get the ultimate reward and silence the 
skeptics.

&gt; 
&gt; What does everyone think about the theory that some EVP&#x27;s are 
&gt; generated by the human brain? Could this be possible?
