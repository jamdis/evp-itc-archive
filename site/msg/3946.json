I know there are tricksters. Native Americans call them \nCoyote or Skinwalkers. \n\nFrom the clear voices and degree of two-way dialog, for me it&#39;s \nsimply about getting straight answers. I&#39;m planning to try and be \nrigorous about testing any spirits or whatever they are before \nproceeding. The last thing I wish to do is entertain some demon or \nentity that is all about lying and half-truths.\n\nLance\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; But it must raise questions, mustn&#39;t it, Bruce? Who are these  \n&gt; entities we are talking to and why would it be such a problem for \nus  \n&gt; to know who they were in life? If these are dead humans, it can&#39;t \nsee  \n&gt; how it would make any difference at all. In fact, to me, being \nable  \n&gt; to talk about human things with them is rather the only way to \nprove  \n&gt; that they are dead humans. It does concern me that these entities \nare  \n&gt; not human, not because I would particularly care if they were  \n&gt; extraterrestrial or extradimentional and just admitted that, but  \n&gt; because my personal desire is to talk to people like me who have  \n&gt; crossed over.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you ask them to give you some sort of reason why they can&#39;t \ntell  \n&gt; you more about themselves?\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, my 2 cents. I know that my line of inquiry with the box is  \n&gt; going to be directed at people who have crossed. Maybe I&#39;ll get \nsome  \n&gt; answers of my own shortly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Dec 5, 2007, at 7:44 PM, bruce halliday wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ann,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What I get from mike & Lisa when I ask personal questions about  \n&gt; &gt; them is a reluctant answer at best.\n&gt; &gt; I have already thought to ask all of the questions you mention \nand  \n&gt; &gt; more and have been answered with\n&gt; &gt; &quot;NO&quot; &quot;can&#39;t&quot; and things like &quot;Wait&quot; so I&#39;m assuming that they \nare  \n&gt; &gt; either not allowed or are not ready for me to find\n&gt; &gt; out about their physical lives. I also get the impression that \nthey  \n&gt; &gt; want to remain as separate entities in my mind\n&gt; &gt; and if I where to know who and what they where in the physical \nit  \n&gt; &gt; would reduce them to a lower level of spirituality\n&gt; &gt; in my mind. that is the general jist of the messages as far as \nthat  \n&gt; &gt; subject goes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt; &gt; Paranormal Investigating Team\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; From: lisby@...\n&gt; &gt; Date: Wed, 5 Dec 2007 19:06:23 -0500\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Comments for Bruce\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rambling thoughts:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The sound quality was not as good with this batch. Lots more\n&gt; &gt; background. Did you change anything?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Okay--I am completely fascinated with who these people are who \ntalk\n&gt; &gt; to us. I have two, both male, and god knows who they really are,\n&gt; &gt; because one has changed identity at least six times over the \nyears,\n&gt; &gt; and one won&#39;t tell anything at all about himself. Period. Oh, he \nsays\n&gt; &gt; that he won&#39;t talk through the box either. I&#39;m tempted to add, &quot;So\n&gt; &gt; there&quot; as a direct quote. LOL. Anyway, Mike and Lisa-- So Mike \nsays\n&gt; &gt; he bled to death in &#39;95; Lisa choked to death in the 1920s and \nnuts\n&gt; &gt; to you for asking, apparently. ;)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Would you ask them some questions for me?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ask Mike which &#39;95 he died in--1995 or 1895?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ask Lisa what her favorite perfume was.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ask them both more biographical questions, such as where the were\n&gt; &gt; born, lived, and died. Their full names. Their spouses&#39; names, \nkids,\n&gt; &gt; etc. I&#39;m a historian/geneologist and I think it would be a blast \nto\n&gt; &gt; look in available records to try to identify them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ask them the year of their birth. If they tell you, there&#39;s a lot \nof\n&gt; &gt; historical questions I love to ask about events within their  \n&gt; &gt; lifetimes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Connect and share in new ways with Windows Live.
