Thanks Snowfire.
 
I know many of you have made contact with Tho=
mas Edison, and  other greats, 
etc... but has anyone ever tried to make co=
ntact with  Jesus Christ to ask 
him questions?
 
I have thought about this=
 many times, but then what would I ask  him always 
sets me back.  
 
For t=
hose of you who have made contact with him, please share  what you 
got, an=
d the types of questions you asked.
 
Thanks
