<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Tim,

I checked out your investigation videos - some impressive results.  

Thanks for sharing it,

Sharon from SF

&gt; Hi guys.
&gt; 
&gt; As some of you know, I work with the inimitable Stacey Jones in a
&gt; ghost hunting group called Central New York Ghost Hunters.  We have a
&gt; TV show that plays throughout Central NY (accessible to over 1.5
&gt; million viewers total) called CNY Spirits.
&gt; 
&gt; In this episode, which has been uploaded to youtube, you can see the
&gt; Minibox Plus on an investigation.  It was used in tandem with a poker
&gt; game and garnered some amazing results.  The Minibox was used in part
&gt; 2, and everyones favorite shack hack was used in part 3.  To my
&gt; knowledge, this is the first time a Minibox has been used on
&gt; television.  You will have to ignore what Stacey says about the
&gt; Minibox because she was dead wrong on most of her facts.  I wish that
&gt; the producer had interviewed me so I could have explained it a helluva
&gt; lot better.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are wondering, I am the goofy looking guy with the pony tail and tattoos.
&gt; 
&gt; You can check out pt 1 here:

&gt; 
&gt; This episode was a followup investigation to a prior one done about 6
&gt; weeks earlier.  This earlier investigation yielded some amazing EVP&#x27;s
&gt; and flashlight responses.  YOu can view pt 1 here:

&gt; 
&gt; These are some of the clips from that session.
&gt; 
&gt; The clip about &quot;pissing me off&quot; has become pretty famous because
&gt; Stacey uses it when she lectures at conferences.  It is very
&gt; intriguing because it is her voice coming through the Hack while she
&gt; is sitting at the table.  I have discussed this clip with a few of
&gt; you, and here it is a lot cleaner than in the video.
&gt; 
&gt; The rest of the clips are from the poker session that were not in the
&gt; video.  On the &quot;Holding a Five&quot; clip, Mike actually had a pair of
&gt; fives in his hand.
