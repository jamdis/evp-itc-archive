Even in your example of the to=

 look like. =C2=A0This is something I would like to get myself and I would =
consider that evidence if it showed up in one of these programs. =C2=A0But,=
 if you have something that looks like a forehead and that is all there is,=
 then it could also look like a rock or some other such object.


I am cert=
ainly hoping for results worked into box sessions. =C2=A0Directing a sessio=
n with intent, like saying "I am going to examine the sound waves of this c=

ositive affirmation that the name you heard is present, then you try the sa=
me technique only you address Tom by name and get a face, that would be eve=
n better.


But, as it stands now, the faces as they appear are random at b=
est. =C2=A0I would be more inclined to believe that when these faces do occ=
ur , they are going to occur with a lesser frequency than multiple images i=
n a few seconds of audio like Ursula's example. =C2=A0If this where the cas=
e, there would be dozens, and possibly hundreds, of faces during a ten minu=
te session and I just don't think that is possible. =C2=A0This is why I nee=

If these partialized faces occur in multiples all the time, I would be more=
 apt to discount it. =C2=A0But, if they are a rarity affixed to only a few =
clips out of dozens, I would be more inclined to believe in them. =C2=A0Sam=
ple size is everything. =C2=A0It is like listening to GBC. =C2=A0If you hav=
e never done a session before, you would be inclined to believe every stray=
 radio signal is a communication. =C2=A0Only by continued practice (expandi=
ng your sample size) can you start to
 rule out stray radio with any degree=
 of accuracy. =C2=A0


On the other hand, I am very new to this and I could=
 certainly be wrong. =C2=A0I will continue to plug sound into the programs =
and hope for the best. =C2=A0


I really want this to work. =C2=A0As you ha=

 apply this same rigor to this new format to show us that they are there. =
=C2=A0If they can, then the world of video and audio ITC will merge in one =
source and then the skeptics be damned!
