The \nupside is that the files are getting longer, meaning better \nconversations.  Maybe frank knows a beavis hicks.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;You car&#39;s still running&quot;---I did this 5 minute session while \ngetting ready for work this morning and my car was outside running to \nwarm up.  I guess they picked up on that.  This file is a little \nrough as well.\n&gt;  \n&gt; _____________\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; I also included the two from Frank&#39;s video that were very clear \nmessages.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;Where&#39;s Purple&quot; and &quot;We&#39;re friggin&#39; People&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Hope you can make out some of these,\n&gt;  \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; p.s. Hang tight for the second set of files.  I have one nerve left \nand Yahoo is jumping on it like a trampoline.  I can only send a \ncouple at a time.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Planning your summer road trip?
