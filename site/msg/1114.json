I don&#39;t know exactly why, after almost two years I am still \nstudying it although I can speculate it could because there is a lot \ngoing on during it&#39;s use. Change of state from liquid to vapor to \nheat and light, IR radiation, thermal noise and some processes I am \nmissing or unaware of. The radio sweep is used as a source of sound \nsamples, the microphone also works well using music or plain speech. \nThe limited high frequency response also seems to act as a built-in \nbandpass filter. I&#39;m not using anything complicated or out of the \nreach of a Wal-Mart or K-Mart shopper. I&#39;m using an off the shelf \noil lamp with a 3/4 inch wide flat wick, a phototransistor from \nRadio Shack and an FM radio.  There is more to the flame microphone \nthen modulated light, I can modulate the DC feeding a flashlight or \nand LED and not get the same results. Here is an exchange using the \noptical microphone and FM radio sweep, my voice is reduced by 10db.\n&gt; Dave: (NOT EVP) &#39;How many of you are are testing today?&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; Response : &quot;Fourty Seven&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Dave: &#39;Please state your name, thank you&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; Response : &quot;Ingrid&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe it&#39;s dumb question, but..................\n&gt; \n&gt;  If the flame is being &quot;modulated&quot; by air movements caused by \n&gt; atmosphereic sound pressure waves, so the flame varies at an audio \n&gt; rate, then those flame variations are picked up via the photo \n&gt; transistor and converted to electrical signals...what&#39;s the \ndifference \n&gt; between the optical mic, and an accoustic mic? And why would one \nwant \n&gt; to introduce yet another seemingly exotic piece of hardware?\n&gt; \n&gt;  I know it&#39;s interesting, but it really has nothing to do with how \nto \n&gt; get ghost voices, and maybe misleading to some that are searching \nfor \n&gt; that magic technology. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;    Frank\n&gt;"}
