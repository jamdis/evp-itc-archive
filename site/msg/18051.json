The spirit&#39;s with the most  credibility are=\r\n going \nto be harder to hear, since they are well beyond  the white light, =\r\nand are \nin much higher plains.  They read our minds, as  they can read the=\r\n minds of \neach other, only the ones in lower plains are not  able to read =\r\nthe minds of \nthose higher spirits if they choose to not reveal  themselves=\r\n.  Because of \nthis it&#39;s going to be tough, if I gave everyone&#39;s  opinion o=\r\nut of the 4 \nminutes, you could write a book, then when I found Dave&#39;s  voi=\r\nce, he was not so \neasy to hear, I had to make it louder, when I tried to  =\r\nreach Him on Skype, \nI couldn&#39;t get what He said correctly, so it was my ow=\r\nn  fault, and not His. \nsf\n \n \nIn a message dated 7/14/2010 6:27:09 P.M.

I think we have=\r\n all experienced \nthe  difficulty in hearing what is on some of these recor=\r\ndings: sometimes  \nwe&#39;re not sure at first what it says. Sometimes we ask o=\r\nthers for their  \ninput.  Sometimes we only hear it once someone else tells=\r\n us it  first.  \nSometimes we hear it wrong.  Sometimes we hear it  right. =\r\nAnd so on.\n\nIt would be useful to know, as an individual,  how good we are =\r\nat hearing \nit right, so we have some idea how  trustworthy our skill, or m=\r\nethods, or \ntechnology, is.  If we can  measure that, or even get a feel fo=\r\nr it, we can \nlook for ways to improve  it.  If we can&#39;t measure it, then w=\r\ne could be stuck.  \n \n\nSo, by restricting the answers only to the timeframe=\r\n of the  experiment, we \ncan help filter out some of the problems of subjec=\r\ntivity:  for example, one \ntheory is that people can hear what they want to=\r\n hear,  or can these sounds \nin a certain way, once you already know the  a=\r\nnswer.  Or, given 2 ways to \nhear a sound, being influenced, even  subconsc=\r\niously, to hear it one way over \nthe other.  We want to rule  that out.\n\nTh=\r\nis is one reason we can only count on answers given  during the \ntimeframe.=\r\n  That is when the answer is most  objective.  Once the object has been \nan=\r\nnounced, we move into  a  period where we can&#39;t discount possible influence=\r\n \nfrom already  knowing the answer.\n\nBut, I am confident that if a person&#39;s=\r\n method  or technology really can \nreveal the correct answer outside the  t=\r\nimeframe, then doing it within the \ntimeframe should be just as easy,  and =\r\nwould then be a valid objective result \nfor all to see.\n\n--- On  Wed, 7/14/=\r\n10, SnowfireL@..., 7/14/10, &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom:  Snowfir=\r\neL@...&lt;SnowfireL@...&gt;\nSubject: Re:  [EVP-ITC] Experiment 20100710 =\r\n- RESULTS!\nTo:  EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsTo: \nDate: Wednesday, July 14, 2010, 2:5=\r\n0  PM\n\n\n \nit doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s in  the whole file, I didn&#39;t think it was=\r\n possible \nto have a radio sit on  top of a pc screen i guess.

I admire your courage and  \nmotivation to try different m=\r\nethods, see what  works, and try to improve \neveryone&#39;s  understanding of E=\r\nVP-ITC.\n\nIf you recall,  on 7/10/2010 I placed an object on top of my  comp=\r\nuter \nmonitor, right in front of me, and left  it there until today, 7/14/2=\r\n010, noon \nDenver  time. The experiment was for participants to  determine =\r\nwhat it was. \nVague or partial answers  wouldn&#39;t be counted (for example, j=\r\nust colors,  \nshapes, sizes, what it&#39;s made of, etc): we&#39;re  looking for wh=\r\nat it is. \nParticipants could use  their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or I s=\r\nuppose  any other \nmeans they chose.\n\nIn order to  keep me honest, I took a=\r\n picture of the object  at the start \nof the experiment and loaded it to  t=\r\nhe Files section (RJ folder) of this \ngroup. If  you can follow the link, i=\r\nt is here:\n\n_http://tech.  groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/  RJ/RJ.2=\r\n0100710. \n1.zip_ (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20=\r\n100710.1.zip) \n\nThe idea was  that you could download the file at the  begi=\r\nnning of the \ntest, and &#39;keep it safe&#39; on  your computer. Then at the end o=\r\nf the test, I  \nwould release the password so you could reveal  the content=\r\ns of the file.

All that we can really agree on =\r\n from this \nexperiment is that no participant,  with whatever theories or m=\r\nethods or \ntechnology  they used, was able to correctly determine the  obje=\r\nct.

All that we can really agree on \n                              =\r\n  from this experiment is that no participant, \n                           =\r\n     with whatever theories or methods or technology \n                     =\r\n           they used, was able to correctly determine the \n                =\r\n                object. We can&#39;t say those theories or methods \n           =\r\n                     or technologies never work. Just as we can&#39;t say \n    =\r\n                            they do.
