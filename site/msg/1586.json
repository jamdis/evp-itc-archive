It was kinda weird, cuz before I started \nrecording &quot;they&quot; were speaking direct, and called me by name, very loud and \nclear, but when I started recording they seems to go away, even though there \nwas plenty of broadcast fragments heard, but there was some good voices that \ncame though.
