&gt; &gt; I know what it is, even though I can&#x27;t even spell it or pronounce it.
&gt; It&#x27;s what the skeptics and debunkers tout as the answer to all paranormal
&gt; experience. I think we ought to pull our claws back in, especially me!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have gotten &quot;voices&quot; that I thought were perfectly clear, and no one
&gt; else could hear it, and some I found was just a snippet of music, so yeah,
&gt; that happens, but it does not eliminate or explain everything from the
&gt; boxes, and other EVP methods, you just have to be aware of the possibility.
&gt; Anotherr problem is broadcast fragments, sometimes they are just what they
&gt; sound like, an ad for one thing or another, sometimes they can have
&gt; sychronistic meaning, and sometimes they can be altered in some way to form
&gt; a messages, such as the recent one I had about learning sex, which was
&gt; seemingly ignored by all cuz it has the &quot;s&quot; word--I guess. The fragments can
&gt; also be distorted as the radio tuning is swept across a station, I don&#x27;t
&gt; accept every word and syllable as meaning something. You have tio judge
&gt; mnessage by content and personal meaning.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have seen faces stand up in a carpet right in front of me, not
&gt; something I just happened across, something that happened live as I watched.
&gt; For someone to suggest that&#x27;s imagination I find very offensive.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When I first switched to a linear sweep in the boxes, I could hear
&gt; nothing but gibberish, then suddenly I could hear &quot;them&quot; speaking. I doubt
&gt; that is all imagination either, I think the mind(which is not brain) has to
&gt; reprogram the ears, which are brain, to hear. I also think the skeptics can
&gt; not allow this programming to take place, hence they can&#x27;t hear. I would be
&gt; very surprised if any of the hard core skeptics even turned on a box for
&gt; fear that they may hear something that&#x27;s not there. Rorke(the Phd) implied
&gt; as much when he wanted a box to test, or more like debunk. That crap is
&gt; frikkin&#x27; pathetic!

&gt; &gt; Please read this article, and more, if you have any questions about it
&gt; being psuedo science. I chose the Wikipedia version because I thought it
&gt; would be the least offensive to you. Other articles specifically called out
&gt; EVP and other things.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For the record, I don&#x27;t think all EVP&#x27;s are due to pareidolia.

&gt; &gt; It was implied that all this stuff is &quot;Pareidolia&quot;, and because you could
&gt; put a name on it that somehow meant it was all explanined. I&#x27;ve been hearing
&gt; this pseudo scientific BS for 10 years, so I&#x27;m a bit touchy. Science
&gt; explains the paranormal away, and yet people continune to photograph images,
&gt; and get their names, and the names of deseased loved ones through EVP, as
&gt; well as questions answered, and science(althogh not all scientists) just
&gt; ignores these inconvinient facts and focuses on that we might see things
&gt; that are not there, which I disagree with as well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Did you even bother looking at the image on the group home page. That was
&gt; from sweeping a TV tuner with a random voltage and video recording the
&gt; monitor screen. So explain away why there is a wolf image embedded in the
&gt; guy&#x27;s hat, an image of an alien below his ear, and why in God&#x27;s name does he
&gt; resembles the classic description of an MIB or Shadow Person? Pareidolia no
&gt; doubt!

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m not sure who you&#x27;re talking to about &quot;holier than thou&quot;. But, you are
&gt; the one who keeps dismissing any question about results and testing with
&gt; phrases like &quot;Bite Me&quot;. I don&#x27;t see anyone else doing that, and I certainly
&gt; never have.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I agree trying new things is good. And discussing results. And looking
&gt; for new directions. So I&#x27;m still not sure who you are upset with. Perhaps
&gt; you could be more specific: quote what you have found objectionable, and let
&gt; us know why?
