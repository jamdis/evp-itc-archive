<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, you&#x27;re in luck! The guy that makes it just happens to be a
member--recall the discussion over the RT. I would expect the same
reaction-- we do not know what we are talking about, even though every
advancement in the box is from this group.

&gt; I watched another great episode tonight at the Villasca Axe Murder house
&gt; and it was a good show, but....
&gt;
&gt; It seems the main focus on their show is evp&#x27;s and spirit communication,
&gt; which is preferred for my taste.  But they are using the sb7 ghost box.
&gt; That is the worst box to use for spirit communication, it gets poor
&gt; reception and the sweep is horrible.  Any voices that could and do come
&gt; through are drowned out by the unnecessary white noise incorporated into the
&gt; sweep.
&gt;
&gt; I would like to get in touch with them and give them a quality ghost box to
&gt; work with.
&gt;
&gt; So.....Does anybody know how i can get a hold of these guys?
