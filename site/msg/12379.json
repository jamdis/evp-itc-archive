So far there are alot of good people in there and more joining everyday. I also posted some never before seen personal ITC images there in the gallery. It will also let you post up to 100 of your mp3 evp results or music or what have you. I dont usually post these but as I said there are some really good people including some from this group =) and it has some great features I didnt mention all for free.\n\nhttp://psychicnetwork.ning.com/profile/Misty\n\nIf ya join you can add me as a friend if you want =)\n\nMisty"}
