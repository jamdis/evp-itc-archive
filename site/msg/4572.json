Great captures Frank!  It appears to be the save voice for both clips.  Can I ask what time of day these were taken? \n   \n  Joel and I have started composing log sheets for sessions to record different factors including the weather conditions, the amount of channels and time the of day in which each session is being conducted.  We are trying to determine if there is rhyme or reason to clairity of the clips along with boxes we are using.  In a couple of sessions we were told to switch boxes (in which we did) and the clairity of the clips were alot stronger for real time communication.\n   \n  Juli\n\npsi_research &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n          That could be it.
