This one is of a totally \nportable system that uses a noise generator, the hacked 12-470, a \ndigital (or analog) recorder, and a microphone which gathers the raw \naudio sweep, white noise (or in my case a special white/pink noise file \nI created), and any ambient noise within a chamber.. and places that \nsession int a .wav file.  It also includes an ear piece so you can \nhear, real time, what the digital recorder is recording (the mixer of \nthe session sound within the chamber).\nStay tuned for that video later today....\n\n- Mike\nAll my Radio Shack Hack videos can be found at\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com"}
