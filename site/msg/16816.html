<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m new here and just chiming in with my two cents....

As a practicing medium I do believe Spirits get stuck.  There is a different
energetic feeling I receive when connecting with someone who has truly
crossed over and is now &quot;in spirit&quot; versus someone who has not.   Those who
are stuck either do not realize they have died or they are attached to our
Earth plane (be it a particular person or event) and don&#x27;t want to or know
how to leave.  I believe it is those stuck individuals who are often behind
the rattle &amp; clatter in hauntings---although this topic is still new to me.

For those who have actually crossed over (and I believe this is the majority
of souls), they return to Spirit and become the light &amp; love they came
from.  Spirits have much better things to do than haunt us, they continue to
learn and evolve on the other side.  However, they do enjoy communicating
with us, especially letting their loved ones know they are ok.

Best,
Alyson

&gt;  Just like I am skeptical about hauntings, not that I don&#x27;t believe
&gt; something is going on, I don&#x27;t think there are stuck spirits, so I think
&gt; hauntings are a show for the living.

&gt;&gt; Wow, Tom...excellent way to sort and define the differences. Do you mind
&gt;&gt; if I quote you on that? Would like to share that thought with some friends I

&gt;&gt; What Frank is referring to is more properly termed a &quot;Pseudo-Skeptic&quot;.
&gt;&gt;  Indeed Skepticism is a vital part of scientific investigations, but it&#x27;s
&gt;&gt; Skepticism based on consideration of the facts and  expressing a caution or
&gt;&gt; difference of opinion is what is useful in the Scientific community.  A
&gt;&gt; pseudo Skeptic is characterized by a person who clearly does not know the
&gt;&gt; subject area other than through what may be termed &quot;common knowledge&quot; or, at
&gt;&gt; best, a brief overview of the literature.  A  Pseudo skeptic&#x27;s &quot;opinions&quot;
&gt;&gt; are based primarily on an emotional attitude towards the subject matter
&gt;&gt; rather than what few &quot;facts&quot; he knows.  Its a psychological defense he uses
&gt;&gt; to shore up his status, the validity of his work, and to cope with things
&gt;&gt; that frighten him.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; A real Skeptic is a friend with a difference of opinion based on a genuine
&gt;&gt; desire to help and sufficient data on the subject at hand to know what
&gt;&gt; he/she is talking about.  We, as Scientists must always have a health dose
&gt;&gt; of real Skepticism.  Otherwise we risk being the exact inverse of the Pseudo
&gt;&gt; skeptic---the &quot;FLAKE&quot;.  The Flake is the type who will believe anything.
&gt;&gt;  Just as the Pseudo Skeptic has a need to reject things on emotional
&gt;&gt; grounds, the Flake has a need to accept EVERYTHING on emotional grounds.
&gt;&gt;  Any shadow,  sound, or corner of the eye flash just HAS to be a ghost or
&gt;&gt; spirit. ----or whatever.  I think you know the type, and   these &quot;flakes&quot;
&gt;&gt; are what Pseudo skeptics accuse us who are serious about paranormal studies
&gt;&gt;  of being.  Perhaps its one of the reasons they get us so angry.

&gt;&gt;   I&#x27;ve heard the same said for the evp researchers!  But it&#x27;s not that
&gt;&gt; simple in either case:
&gt;&gt; the last block that you reference has small print that says &quot;Compare the
&gt;&gt; hypothesis to the experiment&#x27;s conclusion&quot;.  Which of course you can&#x27;t do
&gt;&gt; unless you already visited the hypothesis block and have a hypothesis to
&gt;&gt; which to compare.  That in turn has small print which says &quot;predict the
&gt;&gt; outcome of the problem&quot;, which of course you can&#x27;t do either unless you&#x27;ve
&gt;&gt; already visited the earlier block of Purpose (&quot;state the problem&quot;).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s helpful to deny good evidence, whether it is good
&gt;&gt; evidence from someone claiming to have detected spirits, or whether it is
&gt;&gt; good evidence from someone claiming that people can mistake noise for speech
&gt;&gt; or random radio tunings for spirit control.  That&#x27;s why the scientific
&gt;&gt; method is valuable: it keeps both the skeptic and the believer real.
