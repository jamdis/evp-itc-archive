Every entity has a right to this knowledge and has \nthe ability to gain it with or without technical means. You have to \naccept that all realities are true in the eyes of those who behold \nthem.

If I were Frank, I&#39;d be beating my head against the \nwall. Oh. Wait. He already is.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; What a total load of ego-driven crap. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Chris, if you&#39;re reading, may I suggest that you are the one who is \nfalling victim to &quot;false&quot; communication? Or that your head is getting \nwaaaay too big? Or if you already know that you&#39;re just in it for the \ncash, that you find another way to pay your bills?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; You know, though, this same shit has happened to every group of \nparanormal researchers since the field began. I&#39;ve watched group \nafter group come together and explode for thirty years because only \nthe Chosen had the right to control the message, would broke no \ncriticism of *any* of their own results *ever*, but had plenty of \ndefinitive pronouncements about everyone else&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This is why I scoff at the idea of &quot;Harmony,&quot; with the capital H. I \nhave seen the concept used by everyone from the Warrens in the 60s-\n70s to the Harsch-Fischbachs in the early 80s to Moon today trying to \nuse this idea of being somehow chosen and sacred in order to \nget &quot;real&quot; messages from spirit. Harmony is a way to control who gets \nto play and IMHO, it&#39;s a load of nonsense.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce, I have to tell you that the message you got the other day \nabout us being all Kumbaya set my alarms off, perhaps innocently, but \nnonetheless. I&#39;ve found there is such a fine line between real peace \nbetween brothers working for the real common good and peace between \nbrothers as a mechanism of control. Yes, we need to be at peace to \nwork together. But that peace has to be an inclusive peace. It has to \nbe a peace within one&#39;s self above all else. It needs to be a \n*fearless* interior peace, too. The Harmony is within, folks. It&#39;s \nnot judging whether others have it or not before we let them play. It \nis pure, unadulterated *internal* knowledge about one&#39;s self. Judge \nnot, lest ye be judged--remember that one?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; HMO YMMV, toujours,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ann\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Nov 29, 2007, at 9:15 AM, bhali333 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a blog steve sent me from moons myspace page as usual he&#39;s \nin \n&gt; a panic because his fraudulent buisness is going down the tubes. he \n&gt; claims to know the only way box communication can be achieved but \nwho \n&gt; would know better than the box inventor. Frank says it does not \n&gt; matter what means you use it&#39;s the researcher that counts.\n&gt; \n&gt; and if moon is so omnipitent in this research where are the \n&gt; documented recordings of his research, why are they not public for \n&gt; everyone to hear maybe because he&#39;s full of bull. he said recently \n&gt; that no one but him gets legitimate communication, well I think \nit&#39;s \n&gt; the other way around. \n&gt; \n&gt; chris if you read this, stop the cherade and have some dignity. \n&gt; become a real researcher and stop trying to down everyone else so \nyou \n&gt; can continue to pray on the berieved and desperate people. And \nwhile \n&gt; I&#39;m at it, if your so great why are you offering substantial \n&gt; discounts to your so called ghost hunter university. I&#39;ll tell you \n&gt; why, because people are starting to realise you are nothing but a \n&gt; carnival side show palm raeder and have fooled people long enough. \n&gt; \n&gt; the reason I am addresing moon directly on this group is I know he \nis \n&gt; lurking in the shadows to see what is happening with real \nresearchers \n&gt; and will know at least what I think of him.\n&gt; I have done more legitimate box research in one week than he has \ndone \n&gt; ever. My results are posted I challenge him to do the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; here is a copy of his malicious blog from myspace.\n&gt; chris moon&#39;s blog on myspace this morning ***\n&gt; \n&gt; Wednesday, November 28, 2007 \n&gt; \n&gt; The Box has hit the fan! \n&gt; Current mood: distressed \n&gt; Category: Dreams and the Supernatural \n&gt; \n&gt; As so many of you know, I have been the primary tester of the \n&gt; Telephone to the Dead, a.k.a. &quot;Frank&#39;s Box&quot; since 2004, and have \nhad \n&gt; great success using it in paranormal research, and more currently, \n&gt; connecting the living with those on the other side. I have recently \n&gt; been made aware that there are several replica versions of this \n&gt; device being sold. I have also been told of another device that can \n&gt; be purchased for very little from any electronics merchant and \n&gt; altered by hand, producing what some consider to be results. As I \n&gt; expected, the samples that people have sent me are nothing more \nthan \n&gt; timed radio scans that have no validity. \n&gt; \n&gt; What is important to remember, before purchasing any of these \nreplica \n&gt; devices, is that the Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides on the \n&gt; other side have repeatedly explained that the way that the \nTelephone \n&gt; to the Dead technology works, is by spirit energy manipulating the \n&gt; random voltage generator (RVG) and using white and pink noise, as \n&gt; well as radio fragment, to create real time voice answers to \n&gt; questions posed from our side. The most important aspect to this \n&gt; device is the medium operator who works as an antenna \n&gt; or &quot;interpreter&quot; for living individuals asking the questions. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas Edison, in an intelligent spiritual discussion through the \n&gt; Telephone to the Dead, stated that there were only thirty of these \n&gt; individuals that could effectively use the device. Four have been \n&gt; identified to this point. \n&gt; \n&gt; I have spent nearly four years testing and doing paranormal \nresearch \n&gt; with the Telephone to the Dead, and I have built strong \nrelationships \n&gt; with Spirit Technicians and Spirit Guides who I trust, and who \ntrust \n&gt; me. These new &quot;radio scanners&quot; are not only a waste of money for \n&gt; people looking to do research with them in hopes of having \neffective \n&gt; communication with the other side, but may in fact be very \ndangerous. \n&gt; Should demonic and other negative entities learn to use these false \n&gt; devices, the results could be devastating. Though I rarely see eye \nto \n&gt; eye with the Catholic Church on the matter of using the Telephone \nto \n&gt; the Dead, I do admit that they predicted the widespread sale of \nfalse \n&gt; communication devices as far back as last year. I have recently \nbegun \n&gt; to receive requests from individuals asking for help to close \n&gt; negative doorways and portals that they believe they opened using \n&gt; their purchased Telephone to the Dead replica. Others are claiming \n&gt; that I am a fraud because their purchased device doesn&#39;t produce \nthe \n&gt; positive results I have been fortunate enough to have, and claim \nthat \n&gt; therefore, all of my results MUST be false. \n&gt; \n&gt; I can see this spiraling out of control already. Once again, I will \n&gt; continue my research with the actual Telephone to the Dead as well \nas \n&gt; provide public demonstrations and private readings for those truly \n&gt; interested in real time spirit communication.
