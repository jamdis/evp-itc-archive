<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks! Well, that&#x27;s the main thing, I don&#x27;t do investigations, I do 
all my recordings from the basement, at home. Even at Stanely, I was 
present at &quot;investigations&quot; but everyone else asked thew questions, 
iI just kinda stood by.

&gt; Frank, I understand where you are coming from, as I often get 
&gt; frustrated when I hear myself or another asking a question and 
there 
&gt; is an answer within the same audio from the spirits.  So I agree 
with 
&gt; this.  I only hear about 10% of the answers live, and find re-
&gt; listening to the recording at least two times is beneficial to 
catch 
&gt; everything.
&gt; 
&gt; However, we were at a lighthouse that was supposed to be haunted, 
and 
&gt; a lady asked if there was a &quot;Captain Babcock&quot; with us.  About 8 
&gt; seconds later, the reply, &quot;Spirit of Babcock&quot; came through 
clearly.  
&gt; The file is in my folder here.  So I do see value as well in asking 
&gt; questions.  The downside is we have a tendency to talk over them 
&gt; sometimes, yet, it is nice to provide the earthbounds direction to 
&gt; help them speak what we need to hear (to help them).  If people 
think 
&gt; they do not need help, then they haven&#x27;t been doing this enough in 
&gt; places where people in spirit are in trauma.  Believe me, some of 
&gt; them truly are and are in need of help - period.  
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps there are two ways to do this, depending on what one is 
&gt; trying to accomplish.  At a haunted location, I seem to hear 
&gt; enlightened spirits, as well as earthbounds coming through.  This 
&gt; type of situation can be especially helpful to ask questions in my 
&gt; experience, as it helps to ferret out what&#x27;s going on there and 
&gt; provide &quot;evidence&quot; of intelligent responses to the questions.  This 
&gt; worked well to prove the spirit box as legit to the group who 
&gt; accompanied me.
&gt; 
&gt; When just trying to get &quot;higher&quot; messages from spirits, etc at home 
&gt; or elsewhere, I do think just letting it run and record is a great 
&gt; way to work with it, too.  This way, there are no expectations, 
just 
&gt; taking the time to listen for direction, messages of truth, hellos, 
&gt; etc.  Sometimes this way will really surprise you, especially when 
&gt; something comes through &quot;off the cuff&quot; and you are not expecting 
it.  
&gt; 
&gt; Frank, I hear your advice captain, but also want to throw in some 
of 
&gt; my personal experiences into the discussion.

&gt; &gt; Hi All;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  This is why I say don&#x27;t get so tied up asking questions and 
trying 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; get that one profound answer while missing all the real stuff. In 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; file I have in my folder of the 30 second test of #36, the very 
&gt; first 
&gt; &gt; voice is &quot;Thomas Edison(sung)--I Never Visited Frank&quot;, I did not 
&gt; hear 
&gt; &gt; this until the third time I listened to the entire session. I&#x27;m 
not 
&gt; so 
&gt; &gt; intent on runing session after session all friggin&#x27; day that I 
&gt; don&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt; have/take time to listen. If I was trying to hear this stuff 
&gt; direct, I 
&gt; &gt; would miss it, and simialr voices about 99% of the time. That&#x27;s 
&gt; why, 
&gt; &gt; forget the damn questions, and just listen--over and over till 
you 
&gt; &gt; think you&#x27;ve gotten it all. Even my dad, and son come through in 
&gt; their 
&gt; &gt; own time, I don&#x27;t costantly ask for them. I swear to God, they 
know 
&gt; who 
&gt; &gt; is listening, when you are listening/recording, and what you need 
&gt; to 
&gt; &gt; know! Trust it!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  I know, the idiot scientist type will insist you have to ask 
&gt; &gt; questions, and confirm the answers, but that is BS, and results 
&gt; little 
&gt; &gt; useful information. Useful, as in has personal signifgance.
