 This is #24, it's set up to use a sound chamber, the chamber is about 12 =
inches long, 2 inches deep, and about 8 inches wide with a single divider i=
n the center. The ball on top is a quartz sphere from the copper pyramid th=
at used to hang in my work room. another one of thsoe spur of the moment id=
eas. I made the chamber over the holidays, and just now got to try it out. =
the recording starts out "Such incredible sight, Frank....", or that's what=
 I hear anyway. 
 
 #24 uses that LA1816 chip, and works ok on AM, I don't =
know why it works, and successive boxes using the same chip are plagued wit=
h so much noise and static.
