<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The file was slowed by 25 percent. The sweep was at about 1:30 and  
the signal strength at 12. If I turn the sweep up to 3, it sounds  
like gunfire from all the stations around here. Literally. Why do you  
think the sweep effected this? I confess that I have no clue what the  
sweep rate does. I just know that I play with it until I start  
hearing voices that seem to shout words like &quot;Purple,&quot; &quot;Seven&quot; and  
&quot;Lisa&quot; and then we&#x27;re golden.

You really don&#x27;t hear that? I thought the majority of it was pretty  
clear. The first couple words were shaky, maybe, the &quot;We&#x27;re good!&quot;  
and &quot;Okay&quot; were loud enough that I hear it in real time and answered.  
Did you hear it differently?

Hmmmmmm. (Scratching head.)

&gt; Hi Ann,
&gt;
&gt; I did not hear this file the way you labeled it
&gt; I think in part because you had the sweep rate on the mini box
&gt; too slow.
&gt;
&gt; You want to try and keep the sweep rate between 2 and 3 o&#x27;clock
&gt; then use the signal strength knob to adjust for the weaker signals.
