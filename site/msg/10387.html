<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Don&#x27;t let it bother you if you don&#x27;t get anything, though.  Being
newly dead might actually be a hinderance in terms of his ability to
get in contact with you.  I&#x27;ve been doing some research on the
adjustment period after crossing over.  The general recommendation is
that you don&#x27;t try to contact them immediately (funny - I am listening
to a paranormal radio show and they just said the same thing as I was
typing that) as they have a lot to get used to and need to concentrate
on that.  I figure at worst, if they aren&#x27;t ready to be in contact
again yet, they will be shielded from it and you just won&#x27;t get
anything.  However, I know of cases where they were able to be back in
contact within a few days, and sometimes as litte as 24 hours.
Usually, the less traumatic the passing, the quicker they are able to
be back in contact.  If they had led a full life and aren&#x27;t afraid of
dying, it&#x27;s easier, too.

The other consideration with the ITC is that it may take him awhile to
get the hang of manipulating whatever it is they manipulate to
communicate with us.  I don&#x27;t imagine that that is high up on the
checklist of things to do once you die.

My condolences to you and your family
