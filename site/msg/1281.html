<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>hi I am new to this group and have just recently been introduced to 
franks box. I have been a PI and researcher for many years and am very 
interested in this technology. I have heard a demonstration of the box 
by chris moon and he has stated that a message recieved by him from 
thomas edison has informed him that only 30 people on earth will be 
able to operate this box succesfully. Can anyone tell me if this is 
true or can anyone attempt research with franks box and be sucessfull? 
And if so how can I go about obtaining one? 
any help is appreciated.
