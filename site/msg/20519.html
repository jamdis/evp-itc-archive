<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I always keep the sweep at a very fast pace, most don&#x27;t like it like that.  I trained myself to listen that way, i never get questioned by the skeptics.

If you hear a voice that&#x27;s crystal clear, it&#x27;s most likely just radio.  The communication doesn&#x27;t come over that way usually.

I would suggest a test for anybody on this forum.  Set you ghost box at a super fast rate, then just sit back and listen.  After a while you will hear them talk, but you have to get used to listening that way.

I feel that it&#x27;s the only legitimate way to do this.  Just my opinion on that topic.  If i hear someone&#x27;s file with a slow sweep, i ignore it as communication for the most part.

&gt; On your FM 
&gt; at second 10-12 I hear &quot;telephone&quot; and a fainter &quot;hello?&quot; I&#x27;ve gotten one or two &quot;telephone-hello&quot; voices myself.  Very interesting.  
&gt; 
&gt; at about second 18 &quot;you&#x27;re/its so beautiful&quot; a high soft female voice, I&#x27;ve gotten this message before and have also noticed it on others&#x27; files too.  These along with the &quot;I love you&quot;s are a good sign to hear, it means whoever is on the other side is feeling happy right now.
&gt; 
&gt; around sec 33-35 a man says quickly &quot;I&#x27;ve paid a bit cause of you&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; sec 42-43 &quot;wait, just come&quot; harmonic/singing higher pitch
&gt; 
&gt; sec 44-45 &quot;the people are talking to me&quot; also harmonic/singing higher pitch, I think in response to the message at sec 42-43
&gt; 
&gt; sec 46-48 &quot;you must do it&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; sec 49-51 &quot;did you say do that?&quot; another high synth voice
&gt; 
&gt; at 1:02 there&#x27;s the &quot;I love you&quot; :)
&gt; 
&gt; there are so many more communications just on your FM sample, but some are too quick/blurry to decipher quickly, but there are definitely way many more!
&gt; 
&gt; AM sample:
&gt; 
&gt; wow, I hear so much am not sure what&#x27;s communication and what&#x27;s just radio, I&#x27;m also not used to listening to am... what&#x27;s the sweep speed, will it be possible for any full words to come through at all? If not, then you&#x27;ve got a heck of a lot of stuff going on... I heard something about obama twice and have only listened through about half of it.
