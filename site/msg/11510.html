Sony Sound Forge is the audio program you are probably thinking of..   As f=
ar as cool edit- Adobe owns it now.. now it is called Adobe Audition.  I ha=
ve used all 3 and by far prefer Auditon..  but I am an Adobe snob and tend =
to prefer all Adobe products.

        I have sony acid pro 6, I=
 use it for loop creation for a website Im working on currently and for a t=
rack for a animated video Im doing for the intro to my site (that Im doing =
in 3d studio max 9). As far as I can tell sony acid pro is really not a pro=
gram you'd want to use for evp related things, I mean you can but you are o=
ver complicating what you want to be doing. What I use for evp's is cool ed=
it pro. I dont believe the new company that took it over calls it cool edit=
 pro any longer but, I use the older version because it works great for evp=
's, so if you google it you can find it no problem, it makes it easier to s=
trip out ambient noise (like white noise) while leaving the voices complete=
ly entact. its basically like diving deeper and deeper into the sound and i=
t works great for it. Regards,
