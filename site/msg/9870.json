I just wanted to run it, to see if it would even \nwork. An issue that I noticed while doing this is that there is a lag \ntime. When the program does recognize the allophones, it will show \nwhat it thinks was said and will wait for a &quot;sentence&quot; to finish. The \nproblem with that is when doing that, Naturally speaking would erase \nsome of what it thought was said if the allophones kept going. When I \nwas listening, I think I recognized some things that the program \ndidn&#39;t type down. I&#39;ll try to run a few more experiments later \ntonight when I get home from work.\n\nLK: The session was probably maybe 10 minutes or so. The program \ndidn&#39;t type down everything, so I will try to tweak it some more, \nmaybe by slowing down EVPMaker. I believe it became clear longer, \nbecause I slowed it down to 80% or so during the session. I will \ndefinately trying to adjust it some more and share the results again.\n\nStefan/Ron L.: That definately does sound like a good idea. I will \nsee if I can try that. Maybe when I get home, I will see if I can \ncopy and paste the text that is supposed to be read to the group. If \nI can, anybody that can help in synthesizing the allophones to read \nthe text, that would be a great help. To do that you have to have \nAdobe Audition correct? Or is there anything else you can use/build?\n\n-Aaron"}
