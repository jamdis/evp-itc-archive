&gt;  These are from #24, I think it beats every earlier box hands

&gt;  The one about the &quot;Cabbage people&quot; is a head scratcher, clear but 
I 
&gt; have no idea what that means.  
&gt; 
&gt;  This isn&#x27;t the whole session, just a quick scan through, I also 
didn&#x27;t 
&gt; have the line out plugged into the deck&#x27;s line in, I hit the 
earphone 
&gt; jack by mistake, so this session is recorded directly from the 
speaker, 
&gt; something that can&#x27;t be done very well on earlier models because of 
&gt; lack of volume.

They all sound pretty clear some better than others but I guess that 
is when the carrier signal for them is better at that moment.

still unmistakable, can&#x27;t wait to see what developes with the pcb 
boards.
