Thanks, but I just think Spirit are getting better with talking to us then =
 
it use to be when we first started this, now I can even just talk with on=
e 
of  them, and they will skip through others with one word at a time over=
 the 
others  talking, which is really cool!  The ones in the lower plains =
really 
do need  prayer and encouragement from us to keep them moving in th=
at 
"long, line of  regrets" as David calls it.sf
