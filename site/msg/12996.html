<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thank you for the response 

I dont think I will ever record anything again to be honest with you 
and for the most part I havent heard much of anything since I found 
out what the real cause of things were.

Too late on that, but thank you. :) We both had issues. For the most 
part you are right about mine and I won&#x27;t get into hers. I openly 
admit I have trust issues but the control ones only came into play 
here when I felt that I couldnt control or stop what was going on at 
my place even after I questioned them and got nothing.

&gt; I&#x27;ll add that sometimes, those who record evp, get clairaudience. 
This  
&gt; happened to me. What has happened to you is that you&#x27;ve sensitized  
&gt; yourself to the voices. It will take 2-6 weeks for the effects to  
&gt; lessen, but it&#x27;s VERY important for your own mental health to not  
&gt; record anymore ever or at least for a long time.
&gt; 
&gt; The reality is that you&#x27;ve linked up with some negative energies 
that  
&gt; are probably really enjoying you running around and doing 
everything  
&gt; they tell you. They&#x27;re full of poo. There is no mob and they can&#x27;t  
&gt; harm you or your family unless you allow it.
&gt; 
&gt; It sounds like the insanity of the horribly unhealthy relationship  
&gt; with B might have attracted them, but who knows.
&gt; 
&gt; For now, it would be best for you to walk away from recording  
&gt; altogether, and get some professional help for those crazy trust 
and  
&gt; control issues in the near future BEFORE you get involved in any  
&gt; relationship again.
&gt; 
&gt; You may hear the energies in fans, water, etc... for a few weeks 
as  
&gt; they&#x27;ll be pretty disappointed you&#x27;ve disappeared. Ignore them at 
all  
&gt; costs, and eventually this phenomenon will dissipate. Be patient.
