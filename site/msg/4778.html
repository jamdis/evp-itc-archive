<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks! No, it&#x27;s not a failure, that was the wrong word, but it&#x27;s 
disappointing that the system audio isn&#x27;t clearer.

&gt; Frank, I&#x27;ve been impressed with your work since I was first made 
aware of it several years ago.  I didn&#x27;t mean to infer there was a 
problem with the box, but rather was questioning the interpretation 
of the person using it.  You&#x27;re anything but a failure, and my 
inability to hear what he hears is certainly no reflection on you.  
I&#x27;ve heard amazing stuff out of your contraptions, so I know it&#x27;s 
real and it works.  So much of this is subjective though.  The one 
EVP I consider my most profound success is inaudible to everyone I&#x27;ve 
played it for.  Sometimes I feel like I&#x27;ll go crazy because it&#x27;s so 
absolutely clear to me--How is it possible that no one else can hear 
it??  I also agree that the most success in this field will come from 
good intentions and a pure heart, because this is spiritual work as 
much as it is scientific.  Just wanted to say I appreciate and admire 
you.

&gt;       Frank,
&gt;       To someone that we all look up to as an insperation I can say 
that you can make the best box ever and the results might just depend 
on the person or user of the product...
&gt;       Keep working in this direction, keep being a good person.  
Remember one thing, we are the light in the darkness!  There will 
always be people that will try to rain on OUR parade.  We have to be 
the voice of reason so WE can move forward.  This is not about us!  
Its about TRUTH and the light and research.  Thanks for everything 
you have done and continue to do!!
&gt;       I think personally that these devices work best when the user 
is not using the device for personal gain, but for everyones best 
intrests!!
&gt; 
&gt;       Happy New Year!

&gt;         I don&#x27;t know if maybe the audio pick up from the box wasn&#x27;t 
very good, 
&gt;         but I can&#x27;t make out much of that either. It sounds like 
the recordings 
&gt;         I do with a cell phone. I think you&#x27;d have to be there to 
judge it. 
&gt; 
&gt;         Personally I&#x27;m always disappointed at my stuff being out 
there, and 
&gt;         the incredible lack of clarity obatained with it, to me 
that&#x27;s a huge 
&gt;         failure! I know the stuff works, but how to get it to a 
level that can 
&gt;         be understood by most, that&#x27;s the problem, and my focus at 
the moment. 
&gt;         The Mini Box is big step in that direction, so some of the 
pressure if 
&gt;         off, but I still need to get my boxes to professional 
level.
