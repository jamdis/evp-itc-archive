&gt;
&gt;   Well, had a film crew, and interviewers at the house for almost three 
&gt;hours
&gt;   yesterday. I was dreading it, didn&#x27;t really want to go through with it, 
&gt;but
&gt;   as usual, not as a bad as I had imagined. We did run the box for the 
&gt;camera,
&gt;   and &quot;they&quot; were talking, and saying names of at least some prestent. 
&gt;It&#x27;s
&gt;   hard to catch it all  live, so I hope it comes out on the video, and 
&gt;DVRs,
&gt;   since the recordings were being done from monitor speaker on the box.
&gt;
&gt;   It&#x27;s very hard for me to accept being the focus of this kind of 
&gt;attention,
&gt;   but I don&#x27;t see the work stopping, so guess I best get used to it.
&gt;
&gt;   Even my little Yorkie was fascinated, instead of being scared to death 
&gt;of
&gt;   everything, he seemed to be very interestd in the cameras. Usually the 
&gt;dogs
&gt;   bark and bark when someone strange comes in the house, none of them 
&gt;acted
&gt;   thay way with this crew.
&gt;
&gt;   Then there&#x27;s the phone wierdness, maybe realted? for the last couple 
&gt;week my
&gt;   cell would ring about 2:30AM, blockled number, and no one on the it did 
&gt;that
&gt;   last night, same thing. Then at about 4a, my phone rang, then my wifes 
&gt;cell
&gt;   rang, then the house phone, all about a minute apart the last one, and 
&gt;the
&gt;   same thing, blocked number. When it&#x27;s answered, it&#x27;s dead quiet.
&gt;
