I don't see how on earth they would find the right house, either.  No guidelines as to where it is, except possibly in the Denver area.

Descriptions vary: two people said it was "yellow", one person may have said "straw," another said "Greek," and one said "circular."  I think someone also guessed that it is a bra.  I also heard "petticoat," although that is a word you don't hear very often.  I said, "This is exciting!" and someone shot back, "No, it isn't."  lol ~Athena~
