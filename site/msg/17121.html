&gt; Happy Mother&#x27;s Day everyone, I just sent a sad file to my folder, there is
&gt; a funny one in there too.  The sad one is an older lady and young man
&gt; talking to each other, The lady is concerned, saying; &quot;Nick, get up to the
&gt; group, he responds with, &quot;they&#x27;ll see us, she says, are they praying for
&gt; us?&quot;  Pardon me, but I think we have been given this technology for a
&gt; purpose, maybe it&#x27;s to help these souls in darkness, i know some of you
&gt; don&#x27;t believe this, and it&#x27;s always easier to turn our backs, and not see
&gt; pain in someone else.  But, there is a reason, you with all those radios&#x27;s
&gt; out there, with all that power, try helping these folks over there, it won&#x27;t
&gt; hurt us to say silent prayers for them once and awhile think about it folks.
