<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yah, you really should keep some for your self.  I told you before,
some people tend to take advantage of your kindness.  Still haven&#x27;t
gotten around to building anything off your plans, have to get a
decent soldering iron (I have a few electronics projects in the queue
actually, including a home pong kit I have).

By the way, I meant to these two questions a while ago:

1) With your random station switching circuit, how long is the
interval between switches?

2) What&#x27;s the algorithm for the random switching?  Is there anything
in the circuit that cuts out the possibility of it staying within
close proximity of the previous tuning interval?  For example software
wise if I were generating a random number, unless I have a true random
number generation sometimes the &quot;randomness&quot; follows predictable
patterns, even recalling the same number over and over.  So for
example if your circuit is doing a change every millisecond but could
possibly return to the same station several times during a 10
millisecond period, the result would be the possibility of a single
station being tuned for the majority of that 10 millisecond period
rather than the truly random tunings you&#x27;re looking for.

&gt; Its&#x27; the same, I haven&#x27;t used it since. I tried to demonstrate it
for the 
&gt; film crew, but it wouldn&#x27;t work Sunday. I&#x27;ve been too busy just
building 
&gt; boards the past year.
&gt; 
&gt; I gave away my last system sunday, so now hoping to get my own
equipment 
&gt; together, and do more experimenting. I&#x27;m still working on a printed
circuit 
&gt; board layout, but now have to change it again to add in the linear
sweep 
&gt; mode.

&gt; &gt;Heya Frank,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Heh, I know how that is.  My work frowns down on personal use of email
&gt; &gt;as well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;By the way, how&#x27;s it been going with your video ITC development?
&gt; &gt;What&#x27;s your setup look like since the last time I talked to you?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Welcome Marty!  I tend to get tied up, and I still do most of my
&gt; &gt;e-mail at
&gt; &gt; &gt; work, despite almost getting fired for it.--DOH!
