<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

I&#x27;m generally in lurk mode due to some offline priorities that need my immediate attention.  I&#x27;ll probably be fairly silent through mid-July, but I had to speak up when this email crossed my desk.

While I don&#x27;t share Snowfire&#x27;s views in most cases, I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the links &amp; banter.  The recordings are always interesting... and isn&#x27;t that the focus of this group?

I&#x27;m not thrilled with ultimatums, as if the group isn&#x27;t big enough (or big-hearted enough) to include diverse views, respectfully shared.

My two cents: Snowfire, please don&#x27;t leave!

In haste,
Fiona

&gt; leave, but the stuff in that statement below of yours, is very out of  
&gt; context, to each is own.  I was merely presenting something I came across  on the 
&gt; You Tube, I don&#x27;t even know that person. Take care, sf</pre>
