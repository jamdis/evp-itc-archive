He \ncouldn&#39;t stop complaining about how I&#39;d wasted money on a perfectly \ngood piece of equipment only to wreck it for my dumb hobby, but once \nwe got home he took it upon himself to test it and make sure it \nworked.  For some reason it really DIDN&#39;T work, so he took it back to \nRS and exchanged it for another one, and after making sure THAT one \nworked he even offered to help me with the modification.  &quot;No thanks&quot; \nI told him.  &quot;I think I need to do this myself.&quot;  \n\nI can&#39;t pretend the process went as smoothly as I&#39;d hoped, but \nfinally I was done and making the last turn in the second screw of \nthe circuit board.. and then.. The whole thing flew out of my hands \nand both battery wires ripped away from their soldered ends in the \ncasing.  It was all Bob could do to keep from gleefully yelling &quot;I \nknew you were going to break it!&quot;  But then I guess he felt bad \nbecause he ran down to Walmart and got a soldering iron and solder \nand spent an hour trying to put it all back together for me.  \n\nIt&#39;s dead as a doornail, and I&#39;m thinking that if I could break it \nthat easily without even knowing how or why, maybe I&#39;m not supposed \nto pursue this method (sigh).  I guess I&#39;ll just think it over and \nmaybe try again later.  \n\nThanks for all the helpful information though Mike!\n\nRobin"}
