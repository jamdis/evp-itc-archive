New tape.", "author": "judy_in_hollywood", "timestamp": "2008-01-13T23:21:16Z", "full_text": "Hi All, Finally found some nice speakers: Craig CMA3000, white, that fold up w/4 &quot;AA&quot; batteries +plugin that goes into the RS 12-469 earphone jack. $16.00 at CVS Pharmacy. Works SOoooo much better than what I had plugged in! Also, tried a different type of tape; was using Maxwell XL II 90, Memorex DB 60, TDK D 90 type I, and now have TDK SA 90 High Bias type II.  This last one seems to work better. Recorded some clear &quot;voices&quot; + one that said, &quot;I love you, MoM!&quot; Don&#39;t know who that was! Hmmm?! Also, tried to contact John Lennon and it seemed as though he got annoyed at another entity blocking him, one even said, &quot;Take your time.&quot; as I heard him say, &quot;Jam it!!&quot;  I wonder IF this is something he said while alive on Earth???  Wild stuff! 8-)      =Judy="}
