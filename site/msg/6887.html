<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank,

About 5 seconds in on the video to about 8 seconds they say &quot;We Eat 
Pizza&quot;, that&#x27;s what i hear anyway.  That&#x27;s funny because i was doing a 
session over Skype with my sister and i told my sister i had to go and 
eat and the box said &quot;Yeah Pizza&quot;.  They were close, i was having food 
delivered from a pizza place but i was having lasagna.  Either way i 
think they like pizza.  Maybe it&#x27;s all they serve over there???

&gt;  This is the &quot;Ghostman&quot; an old digital Walkman, with a sweep 
generator,  amplifiers to drive stereo speakers, and line output for a 
recorder. My one of a kind version of the Mini Box.
