<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I thought I had listened to the &quot;father file&quot; but I can&#x27;t locate it
now. Any help?

&gt; Now I am sure you arent aware of who I am being, noone else other 
&gt; than misty welcomed me to this group. Being I am not professional at 
&gt; e.v.p.s but yet have gone through listening to many of them from 
&gt; trustful resources, your e.v.p.s make me a bit leery. NOt trying to 
&gt; be rude, so dont go get all upset right off the bat. In your e.v.p.s, 
&gt; this one especially, alot of them sound like you, not the part where 
&gt; you asking questions, but where your dad is supposively answering 
&gt; you. NOw everyone has their own right to opinion so there is now need 
&gt; to get defensive, if all is real there would be nothing to get mad 
&gt; about. I just cant help but notice how odd it is that your e.v.p. 
&gt; questions to your father, seems to answer right away when you ask the 
&gt; question. Also, i notice that after you ask the question i hear 
&gt; something being turned on that has contains the answer to that 
&gt; question. Whether it be your dad or not. I feel its you that is 
&gt; answering, but let me tell you why i figure this.. and please you 
&gt; would like to defend you side of things that would be great, maybe i 
&gt; would be able to change my opinion on the matter. But as of now, 
&gt; e.v.p.s are usually done on the same tape that the questions are on, 
&gt; then in a rewind you can hear you and the e.v.p. but to me it sound 
&gt; like you put the e.v.p. response on another tape. i am not trying to 
&gt; start any kind of fight or be cruel, maybe i could learn something on 
&gt; behalf of how you do your work... thank you
