Snowfire, I do have more than one monitor.=C2=A0 Some are in my closet (s=
o not in this room, and not near me).=C2=A0 And the others in this room are=
 laptops.=C2=A0 None of the laptops had anything on them.=C2=A0 And the mon=
itors in the closet just have other equipment on them.

But now that I've s=
ent out a picture of the monitor, next time everyone knows what it looks li=
ke, so maybe that will help.=C2=A0 Or, I'm open to suggestions for other lo=
cations for the object in question too.=C2=A0 This was just close to me (I =
would see it every day), and was also the monitor I use for this newsgroup.=

Well, RJ don't=

that thing doesn't look like a monit=

Thanks again for =
everyone who participated! I admire your courage and 
  motivation to try d=
ifferent methods, see what works, and try to improve 
  everyone's understa=
nding of EVP-ITC.

If you recall, on 7/10/2010 I 
  placed an object on top=
 of my computer monitor, right in front of me, and left 
  it there until t=
oday, 7/14/2010, noon Denver time. The experiment was for 
  participants t=
o determine what it was. Vague or partial answers wouldn't be 
  counted (f=
or example, just colors, shapes, sizes, what it's made of, etc): 
  we're l=
ooking for what it is. Participants could use their ghost boxes, EVP 
  rec=
orders, or I suppose any other means they chose.

In order to keep me 
  ho=
nest, I took a picture of the object at the start of the experiment and 
  =
loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group. If you can follow=
 
  the link, it is here:

http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/fi=
les/ RJ/RJ.20100710. 1.zip

The 
  idea was that you could download the fil=
e at the beginning of the test, and 
  'keep it safe' on your computer. The=
n at the end of the test, I would release 
  the password so you could reve=
al the contents of the file. That way, you were 
  in control of the origin=
al image during the entire test, not me. 

The 
  password for that file is=
: 123BlastOff
Instructions, if you need them, are 
  also in that RJ folder=
.

And if you did not care to download the zip 
  file before the test, I w=
ill post the final image there too.

So to the 
  results:

Number of parti=
cipants: 5
Total tries: 8
Ambiguous 
  answers: 0
Correct answers: 0

Objec=
t: A radio
Uzipped 
  picture:
http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-IT=
C/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710. 1.JPG

So 
  what do the results mean? All that we=
 can really agree on from this experiment 
  is that no participant, with w=
hatever theories or methods or technology they 
  used, was able to correct=
ly determine the object. We can't say those theories 
  or methods or techn=
ologies never work. Just as we can't say they do. Just 
  that, for whateve=
r reason, they did not work this time. Readers can take the 
  results, use=
 them to improve or change their methods, or keep doing what 
  they're doi=
ng.

If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for 
  improvement,=
 let me know. I hope to get a new experiment up and running soon. 
  Since =
there wasn't much participation Mon-Wed, I think the next experiment 
  wil=
l be arranged to mostly span the weekends.

Again, thanks to everyone 
  wh=
o participated in this first experiment.
