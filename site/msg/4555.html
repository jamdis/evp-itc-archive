<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi All, I didn&#x27;t realize she&#x27;s in her 80&#x27;s and not well. Old   Age can be such a bitch, sometimes! I will send her prayers!

&gt; Sarah is in her 80s now and not well. I don&#x27;t want to say more  
&gt; because I have not spoken to her family, just a mutual friend.

&gt; &gt; long ago from Ebay = what a great book it is &amp; so inspiring!!! I  
&gt; &gt; hadn&#x27;t heard she is sick or anything . . . what&#x27;s going on with  
&gt; &gt; her? I&#x27;d like to send out Prayers her way! Thanks. =Judy=

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sarah is such a brave visionary. Jen &amp; I met her at the Atlanta  
&gt; &gt; AA-EVP
&gt; &gt; &gt; meeting a few years ago and she was surprised that attendees wanted
&gt; &gt; &gt; their photos taken with her and asked for her autograph. It&#x27;s folks
&gt; &gt; &gt; like her and others in this field, including some of the  
&gt; &gt; participants
&gt; &gt; &gt; of this forum, that keep the research moving forward.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; We&#x27;ll make sure Sarah is in our thoughts during this holiday  
&gt; &gt; season. -

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As most of us know, Sarah Estep, was the founder of the AA-EVP-- 
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; route by I, and many of us, first got to the place we&#x27;re at today.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve heard from a friend of mine who is also of that generation of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EVP tapers, that Sarah&#x27;s condition is deteriorating. I&#x27;d like  
&gt; &gt; to ask
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all of you to send positive thoughts her way, as she was always a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very gracious lady who was more than helpful to many, many people
&gt; &gt; &gt; who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were interested in taping. I bought my first equipment from  
&gt; &gt; Sarah&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; husband and benefited greatly from her wisdom, always given  
&gt; &gt; freely.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She will be remembered as giant in this field.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please think of her kindly this Christmas Eve.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
