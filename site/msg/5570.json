Great find for $5.00!\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Debbie Tejada &lt;debbie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; FYI, I was in Bed Bath & Beyond today and found a small speaker on  \n&gt; their clearance rack. It plugs into the earphone jack of your \nsound  \n&gt; device, and has fairly decent sound for something so small and \ncheap.  \n&gt; They had about 4 or 5, I bet other BB&B stores would have them. \nPhoto  \n&gt; attached below. Its a Spi Mini Hi-Fi Speaker, they had black or \nwhite,  \n&gt; for $4.99 (half price). It takes 2 AAA batteries. Works great with \nmy  \n&gt; new RS 12-470.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deb T\n&gt;"}
