I thought frequency is also a measurment of strength. I may no=\r\nt be making much sense here, but can you tell me where I am missing somthin=\r\ng?]\n\nMy answer was that I wasn&#39;t entirely sure myself but I think that Hert=\r\nz measures the wave frequencies of the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Gau=\r\nss only measures the intensity or strength of EMF generated around these wa=\r\nve frequencies. Depending on the range of hertz, an EMF is generated.\n\nI to=\r\nld him that I would check around with other people in the field to make sur=\r\ne.\n\nWas I correct?\n\nThanks!\nApril\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00AD_01CA6DDC.4A48D400\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18852&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYL=\r\nE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;=\r\n&gt;Recently someone asked me the following \nquestion:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;[I am brand new =\r\nto the world of paranormal investigation.
