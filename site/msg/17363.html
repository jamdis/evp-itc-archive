<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Formal box? These thing are radio based, and static and noise kinda come
with the territroy. Filter out the noise and many of the voices will
probably be lost. There are other methods though,lik eEVPmaker, which works
well for higher spirit contact.

 You might try an external antenan, like C. Crane twin ferrite antenna, you
can also make a homemade  AM loop, it works by by placing the radio inside
tho loop so it has access to higher level signals.

&gt; Here&#x27;s an interesting message I received last night, I was asking about
&gt; confirmation of what David keeps telling me,,here&#x27;s what I got. There are
&gt; several people saying things, and me at the end repeating what I think I
&gt; hear the guy before me saying.   You&#x27;ll need to listen at least two times to
&gt; hear it, because of static, wish i could get my hands on one of those formal
&gt; boxes, bet I could get some really good stuff, because they don&#x27;t seem to
&gt; carry so much static. Now, why is that I wonder.  Maybe I can stop the
&gt; static with this 20-125 some how. sf
