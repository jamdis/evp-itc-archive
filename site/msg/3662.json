I receieved a\n&gt; cease-and-desist notice from Radio Shack many years ago when I was\n&gt; modifying their radio scanner products and posting them on the web.\n&gt; Guess what... if you go to scanshack.com you can still see step-by-\n&gt; step instructions on how I modified their scanners, with detailed\n&gt; drawings I did.\n&gt; They (RS/Tandy at that time) lost that battle with me, or I should\n&gt; say their lawyer lost that battle with me.\n&gt; But, as you said... we shall wait and see what is up with this issue.\n&gt; - Mike\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Judy, and everyone else, too--please don&#39;t promote or continue\n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; until we hear from Sum. This may not be what everyone is assuming\n&gt; at\n&gt; &gt; all. My concern is that he has received a cease-and-desist notice\n&gt; &gt; from Radio Shack, which may have been informed that someone was\n&gt; &gt; promoting their product in a way not in compliment with their\n&gt; &gt; corporate image, and that his counsel is advising he comply with\n&gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; What you are telling people to do may be exactly what his own\n&gt; legal\n&gt; &gt; counsel is advising against and may put him in a precarious\n&gt; situation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Please just calm down and don&#39;t make assumption until he can\n&gt; clarify\n&gt; &gt; for us. If it comes down to someone making personal threats\n&gt; against\n&gt; &gt; him, that&#39;s a whole other matter. But he needs to ask for help\n&gt; before\n&gt; &gt; everyone goes all posse, OK?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Dec 1, 2007, at 11:53 PM, judy_in_hollywood wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all, I sent George an email about our group here (to look in)\n&gt; +\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about the RS 12-469 AM/FM digital radio modification - for his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; awareness!
