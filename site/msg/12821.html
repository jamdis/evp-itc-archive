<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Neli. Welcome to the group. I think you will find most people are also trying to find out either who is speaking or how its possible. Thats a journey and a conclusion we each have to do on our own. Theres alot of nice people here who are willing to help when they can.

As for if they are alien spirits, I can only say personally not all claim to have been human. Some claim they were never born here or even have names like we do. While others are people I knew in life who have crossed over and still send validation that they are around.

Good luck on your journey it will be an interesting one!

Misty

&gt; Hello
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m a newbie at this place and would like to know the
&gt; meaning of some 
&gt; of my EVPs, as I have many of them, one of the last ones
&gt; says: &quot;COME 
&gt; WITH US, RECALL&quot; then I asked who were they, and they
&gt; told me &quot;Ummitta 
&gt; people&quot;, I have seen ufos, but I don&#x27;t know if
&gt; they can give messages 
&gt; as the ones of EVP, the very last one, says: CAN YOU HEAR
&gt; ME ? Wow ! I 
&gt; want to know who is trying to communicate with me, as the
&gt; voice is so 
&gt; human that it doesn&#x27;t seems to be a spirit, although
&gt; they speak with 
&gt; low voice. But I am very astonished with the one of
&gt; &quot;come with us&quot; 
&gt; and &quot;Recall&quot; I don&#x27;t know what do I have to
&gt; recall, I do my EVPs with 
&gt; my cell phone, I have time with this practice but lately
&gt; the 
&gt; communications are so clear that I doubt that they can be
&gt; of the spirit 
&gt; world, can some of you help me to understand the message
&gt; please ???
&gt; 
&gt; Kind regards
&gt; Neli</pre>
