They sound like nice people from the 1950s or so.  Nice rounded tones to their voices.  Happy people... very nice!\n\nThanks for posting these!\n\nCheerfully,\nFiona\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n...in garage AM, after 10 seconds\n&gt; they&#39;re talking about signals, at 11-12 seconds &quot;you can&#39;t get the signal&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;  This is when it gets fun!!\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
