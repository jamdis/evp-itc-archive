It&#39;s what =\r\nthe skeptics and debunkers tout as the answer to all paranormal experience.=\r\n I think we ought to pull our claws back in, especially me!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;I have gotten &quot;voices&quot; that I thought were perfectly cl=\r\near, and no one else could hear it, and some&nbsp;I found&nbsp;was just&nbs=\r\np;a snippet of music, so yeah, that happens, but it does not eliminate or e=\r\nxplain everything from the boxes, and other EVP methods, you&nbsp; just hav=\r\ne to be aware of the possibility. Anotherr problem is broadcast fragments, =\r\nsometimes they are just what they sound like, an ad for one thing or anothe=\r\nr, sometimes they can&nbsp;have sychronistic meaning, and sometimes they ca=\r\nn be altered in some way to form a messages, such as the recent one I had a=\r\nbout learning sex, which was seemingly ignored by all cuz it has the &quot;s&quot; wo=\r\nrd--I guess. The fragments can also be distorted as the radio tuning is swe=\r\npt across a station, I don&#39;t accept every word and syllable as meaning some=\r\nthing. You have tio judge mnessage by content and personal meaning. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;I have seen faces stand up in a carpet right i=\r\nn front of me, not something I just happened across, something that happene=\r\nd live as I watched. For someone to suggest that&#39;s imagination I find very =\r\noffensive.&nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;When I first switched =\r\nto a linear sweep in the boxes, I could hear nothing but gibberish, then su=\r\nddenly&nbsp;I could hear &quot;them&quot;&nbsp;speaking. I doubt that is all imaginat=\r\nion either, I think the mind(which is not brain) has to reprogram the ears,=\r\n which are brain, to hear.&nbsp; I also think the skeptics can not allow th=\r\nis programming to take place, hence they can&#39;t hear. I would be very surpri=\r\nsed if any of the hard core skeptics even turned on a box for fear that the=\r\ny may hear something that&#39;s not there. Rorke(the Phd) implied as much when =\r\nhe wanted a box to test, or more&nbsp;like debunk.
