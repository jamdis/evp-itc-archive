I \nhaven&#39;t had any feedback on my posts in months.  Being that this \nboard has nothing to do with ITC research anymore and more about \nappliances that are broken.  People are probably wondering why \noccasionally some are posting audio files, maybe we are wrong for \nimposing on their chat room.  I have a toaster on the fritz so maybe \ni can join in on the chat now.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce,\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Happy New Year to you too! Thanks for tryin but sometimes its \njust not for everyone ears. Never know who hears what til ya post it \n=) I dont worry about quality so much anymore because whats crystal \nclear for some sounds like blahbedeblah to others. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;           Misty,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Happy new year, I listened to the files a few times and unless you \nread \n&gt; what they are labeled I could not hear anything but misty in the \nsecond one\n&gt; I don&#39;t think it was quality just volume of the voice itself.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;   To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; From: bulletbabea@...\n&gt; Date: Mon, 31 Dec 2007 19:42:02 -0800\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Frank&#39;s Box on YouTube\n&gt; \n&gt;         Every method has its moments! Happy New Year!!!! \n&gt; \n&gt;   Misty\n&gt; Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;       I don&#39;t know if maybe the audio pick up from the box wasn&#39;t \nvery good, \n&gt; but I can&#39;t make out much of that either. It sounds like the \nrecordings \n&gt; I do with a cell phone. I think you&#39;d have to be there to judge it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Personally I&#39;m always disappointed at my stuff being out there, and \n&gt; the incredible lack of clarity obatained with it, to me that&#39;s a \nhuge \n&gt; failure! I know the stuff works, but how to get it to a level that \ncan \n&gt; be understood by most, that&#39;s the problem, and my focus at the \nmoment. \n&gt; The Mini Box is big step in that direction, so some of the pressure \nif \n&gt; off, but I still need to get my boxes to professional level. \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt;    \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt;   Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo! \nMobile.
