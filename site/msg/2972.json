IIRC, the\ntheory of operation was all of the tones and harmonics were combined\nto create voices. The recorded output was somewhat hard for me to\nunderstand due to all of those tones. Now what if the discrete tones\ncould somehow be filtered out of the output, allowing only processed\nvoice to pass through? I&#39;m sure the circuitry would be very\ncomplicated. This is probably just the Ny-Quil talking though.\nElectronic engineering is beyond the scope of my knowledge.\n\nGood Night!\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; That would be interesting, a hardware version of evp maker that would\n&gt; sample the voice of a person speaking into a mic onto a memory chip.\n&gt; Then slice,scramble, and play back that persons voice. It would be an\n&gt; alternative to a tuner and to the RNG concept, which is also good. The\n&gt; RNG idea Frank S proposed reminds me of Spiricom if you use tone\n&gt; generators that mimic the human voice. \n&gt; -Bill\n&gt;"}
