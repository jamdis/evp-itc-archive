Cool Debbie, a bit like Sonia Rinaldi does especially if your using a duo phone line. You can record straight into the pc too if you hook it up right. I tested that out a few times and I had results. Nobody is up at 2am to test with me tho LOL so I set it aside. Still have all the hookups tho.
   
  And so very nice to offer it free!!! It's nice to see some of us know the meaning of "share".
   
  I'll be gettin vacation soon so if ya need some help testing give me a holler.

(lol) .. It seems like it has potential and I'm working on clarity and 
longer messages. You can listen to my first recording in the file 
marked Debbie's recordings/MiniBox/Messages via Telephone.
