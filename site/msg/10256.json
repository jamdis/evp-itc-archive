But full fledged researchers. Of \n&gt; &gt; course they have much to learn, but so do we all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Which brings me to my suggestion.\n&gt; &gt; Steve and I have recently been discussing the point we have \n&gt; reached \n&gt; &gt; in the research, both in process and knowledge. We agreed on most \n&gt; &gt; points,\n&gt; &gt; the most important one being. It is time to move beyond the same \n&gt; &gt; mundane session content and the same rudimentary line of \n&gt; questioning.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This research is stagnating for lack of direction, any posted \n&gt; files \n&gt; &gt; or discussions revolve around the same stale subjects such as, \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Is there anyone there that wishes to communicate&quot; , \n&gt; &gt; &quot;What is your name&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;who am I speaking with&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;what is it like where you are&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I believe we have all received every combination of answer to \n&gt; those \n&gt; &gt; questions that we possibly can, yet we continue to ask them \n&gt; session \n&gt; &gt; after session. And still become amazed at a yes or no answer or \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; simplest of phrases.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am not saying this about any single level of researcher but all \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; us myself included have fallen into this rut. We are not learning \n&gt; &gt; anything, All our efforts are amounting to nothing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We already know that we are communicating with someone or \n&gt; something. \n&gt; &gt; I believe we have all come to believe that through our personal \n&gt; &gt; research and the evidence presented by all of us.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Within the last year the technology and potential of this type of \n&gt; &gt; research has exceeded all expectations in it&#39;s quality and speed \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; development. We are actually letting it go to waste.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I and a few other researchers believe that whoever is on the other \n&gt; &gt; side of the line has had a hand in some of us developing this new \n&gt; &gt; equipment and methods of research be it obvious or subtle.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But our methods of research have not excelled, we are conducting \n&gt; &gt; research in the same manner as we did when there where only about \n&gt; 5 \n&gt; &gt; of us in the whole world actively doing this research.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; New individuals are joining our ranks and becoming interested in \n&gt; box \n&gt; &gt; research every day. The protocol they are being instructed to use \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; antiquated and obsolete.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is fine to teach them these methods as a basic foundation of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; research and to get their feet wet. But like any other education \n&gt; &gt; process it must evolve and develop with the accumulation of \n&gt; knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If we approached academic education the way we approach box \n&gt; research, \n&gt; &gt; we would all still be in the first grade.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I propose a committee to develop a method of research and protocol \n&gt; &gt; that can deal with the ever evolving technology and decide what \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; how we should approach the type of communication we seek and the \n&gt; &gt; subject matter that should be addressed, that will be continually \n&gt; &gt; changing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Only in this way will the wheels of research and learning move \n&gt; &gt; forward and we will gain the knowledge we seek and hopefully be \n&gt; able \n&gt; &gt; to share it with the world someday.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But if we continue to ask &quot;Is anyone there willing to speak with \n&gt; me&quot;\n&gt; &gt; We are doomed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyone that wishes to discuss this and give opinions or suggestions\n&gt; &gt; please lets try and get started every minute we waste is a missed \n&gt; &gt; opportunity for learning.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                            \n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- ---\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
