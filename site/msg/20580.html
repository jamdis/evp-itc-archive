<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I kinda think that, if there is such a thing as the antichrist, it&#x27;s globalization, and it&#x27;s mark is money.  Look at what we worship.  Money.  But that&#x27;s getting into a whole different conversation there... so I&#x27;ll stop.

&gt; This would be a very ripe time for an antichrist to come into the scene  
&gt; too, calm everything down in all these country&#x27;s, coming on as a good guy then 
&gt;  starting to pull in the reins on those by control of food, making everyone 
&gt; to  worship him as a god, etc..then get a huge war 3 started, and cause 
&gt; people  everywhere to loose their life, and ruin the planet even further with 
&gt; the  nukes.  There is something going on out there, for sure. sf

&gt; Just saw the video with the horse... wow that&#x27;s really freaky... it&#x27;s like  
&gt; a ghost, no one disperses where it rides through, and it just vanishes into 
&gt;  thin air as it goes into the thicker crowd.... very visible, half 
&gt; translucent  and sort of blurry
&gt; 
&gt; well it&#x27;s either 
&gt; 
&gt; a) a hoax or an unintended  glare from somewhere
&gt; or 
&gt; b) the real thing
&gt; 
&gt; That&#x27;s about the only  two options....

&gt; &gt; Australia&#x27;s been very  badly beaten by weather lately, strange stuff with 
&gt; animals dying - I have to  admit it&#x27;s strange and they don&#x27;t give plausible 
&gt; explanations and insult our  intelligence - revolutions in the Middle 
&gt; East.... like I&#x27;ve said before, Snow,  I do have to give you that if these aren&#x27;t 
&gt; the end times, I&#x27;d hate to see how  much worse it can look.... and as for 
&gt; me, I know how morbid this sounds, but  you know what if its the end, please 
&gt; please please bring it on, I am so weary  of the nastiness of people and 
&gt; what they&#x27;ve done to this world and each  other... on the other hand, we also 
&gt; had revolutions before in 1989 and it  wasn&#x27;t the end of the world, and they 
&gt; say animals die off all the time in  nature (albeit with acceptable 
&gt; explanations).... and we&#x27;ve always had natural  weather disasters... is it possible 
&gt; that the media is just covering stuff too  much, or that we&#x27;re all very 
&gt; connected with the Internet, so we have an  overload of bad news all the time? 
&gt; (Cause you kn ow the media is not going to  give us the good news, its just 
&gt; doesn&#x27;t sell as well as the bad news).... who  knows... I have a friend who 
&gt; is Christian and she says that it feels like  we&#x27;re living in the last days 
&gt; of Rome... sadly, by what I see around me, I  really have nothing with which 
&gt; I can disagree... we can only wait and  see....
