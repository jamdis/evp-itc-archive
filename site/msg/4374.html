<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for your insight, Misty.  Very interesting input.  :) 

I am wanting to find my handler/operator. Is Gino the person?  I 
heard male and female voices on this.  Suggestions anybody?

&gt; I can hear most of that. I hear a couple different words here and 
there but overall message is the same. For instance I dont hear I am 
the one. I hear &quot;5 to 1&quot; which reminds me of something they said 
before about 5 to one people dont hear perfect. I hear more 
around &quot;gino&quot; too. Good session.

over- can you repeat that?&quot; Then I hear the male voice say, &quot;I am. 
I&#x27;m the one.&quot; I then say, &quot;You are? What&#x27;s your name?&quot; Then I hear 
the male voice say, &quot;Gino.&quot;
