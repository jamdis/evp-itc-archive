You will still get the fuzzy pixel ones but occasionally a face jumps out of nowhere and freaks ya out. That is why I try and stick to stuff that doesnt have any people in it now and I record about 1-2 inches away from the screen so theres glare and stuff like that going on. So I am 100% positive that what comes thru was never there.

That was how they showed me that thier suggestion worked better than the feedback loop way I was using before. They suggested using the tv I just didnt know how they meant exactly because I was still getting fuzzy images....I thought maybe they meant use it for the feedback loop with a camcorder. So while I did my session I asked them to show themselves clearly if I was doing it the way they wanted or I was going to stop until I got the camcorder...and then I got that.
