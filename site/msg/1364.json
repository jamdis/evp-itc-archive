The articles are published this month in \nTAPS Paramagazine.  The pdf can be viewed at \nhttp://spiritfaces.com/x200706ParamagArticl.pdf.  For those not in \nghost work, TAPS is The Paranormal Atlantic Society, members of whom \nstar in The SciFiChannel&#39;s  popular Ghost Hunters reality show.\n\nBriefly, at a Ghost Hunters haunted week at The Stanley Hotel in \nColorado in March, the 200+ attendees were given demonstrations of \nthe box by Chris Moon.  There were two open mike nights in which lots \nwere drawn for people to come up and ask questions via the box.  \nChris interpreted answers, and was assisted by medium Chip Coffey.  \nMany of the attendees had never heard of the box, and most of them \nhad never seen it in operation, and it caused quite a stir.   Chris \nalso took the box into one of the hotel&#39;s more active haunted rooms, \nas part of the featured ghost investigations.\n\nThere were two other boxes present on site for part of the time, \nowned by Randy Schneider and Bill Murphy.  Fortunately, these boxes \nwere not pressed into service for paranormal tap dancing.  I was \nespecially happy to be able to participate in small group private \nsessions with both Randy and Bill (and one of which included Mark), \nwhich I found far more illuminating.\n\nOne article concerns the controversy over the box (for example, \nshould it be used in haunted places to provoke ghosts; can it dial up \nthe dead on demand), and the other is a Q&A interview I did with \nFrank. \n\nPersonally, I agree with Frank&#39;s vision for the box as an ITC tool.  \n\nRosemary Ellen Guiley"}
