&gt; Hi All;
&gt;
&gt; I found a Honda car stereo at the thrift store this afternoon, I&#x27;m
&gt; always on the look out for car radios! This one has a very usable AM/FM
&gt; tuner that does use the analog tuning voltage, so I can use it in a
&gt; box. All radio functions are in the module itself. This radio was
&gt; unusual in that all the pins and connections were labeled. Usually I
&gt; use a scope and voltmeter to id the pins of the module looking for
&gt; operation voltages, which is usually 8 volts, mode pins, such as a pin
&gt; that is for AM or FM, and goes to 8 volts, or sometimes 5 volts for the
&gt; given band. I also look for any other enable voltages, inputs, and
&gt; audio outputs, and the anttena pin(s). Junk yards usually want $10 each
&gt; for junk radios, and many times they just are not usable. This one was
&gt; $3!
&gt;

Wow, what a find!

Were these pins and connections labeled on the outside of the radio?  When 
I worked in an electronics repair shop, I recall some models of Sony and 
maybe Pioneer had everything labeled inside the radio on the pc board.

&gt; What I said about box concerns, maybe just suffice it to say, use at
&gt; your own risk, there probably isn&#x27;t any danger, and personally I
&gt; haven&#x27;t encountered anything I would relate directly to the box.
&gt; However, that&#x27;s not to say I haven&#x27;t had encounters of an apparent
&gt; demon kind. Just troublesom parasitic entities that once discovered
&gt; quickly leave, not a big deal. I don&#x27;[t want to get that serious wiht
&gt; this. Now if everyone that uses the hack box goes bananas....
&gt;
&gt; Frank-S
&gt;

And maybe an occasional parasitic oscillation?
:-)

I still think the boxes are not causing any danger.
