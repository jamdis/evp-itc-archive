I have been away from this email group for a week and don't know the 
entire thread. I don't know what the main discussion was/is. I am 
'handicapped' myself. I have very poor vision and am considered legally 
blind. Working with ITC is very challenging for me but I love it so I do 
it. I use various softwares that help me 'see' my pictures. Hand tremors 
can be difficult. 4 years ago they discovered an aneurysm in my brain 
and operated. They had to remove a large portion of my skull because the 
aneurysm was so large. I thank them for saving my life but the resulting 
consequences are hard to deal with. I can't smell anymore. My left hand 
has no feeling and will do what it wants when I am typing. I have 
tremors in both hands and do type two fingers. In all I guess you could 
say that I am a mess. The only thing is, I don't consider myself a mess. 
I am having fun. I don't walk to well anymore and my thinking is always 
screwed up. What my head says and what comes out in talk or typing is 
two entirely different things :-) My writings at time are almost child 
like because the appropriate words won't come even though I know them. 
In other words, who cares? I don't. If you don't like what I am saying 
then that is your problem, not mine. If I post something and you change 
it, 'eh, I have the original. I am considering making my own sweep radio 
like Frank's inventions. It won't be nearly as good as Franks but hey, I 
can try can't I? :-)

I have been interested in white noise for years now and now know people 
who also are into it and don't think I am an idiot.

Al, without knowing what went down, calm down buddy. We are all cool and 
in this together!

:-)

Thanks. I was frustrated with the results and was about to trash my
whole collection of evps. Even got kicked out of a board on another
planet. I got the notion that this stuff doesn't work as easily for me
as it does others. Then I blew my top when someone messed with my files
