<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello All!
I just recently discovered this group through the Ufogeek&#x27;s website.
I have been experiencing shadows, electrical sensations that feel like
someone else is with me. With that being said, I ask if this
technology you all talk about on this group would help me speak with
those presences I feel with me? I do not claim a label such as medium,
psychic or any other title as I think labels are limiting. I am just
sensitive.
It is a sense that has run in my family for generations and somewhere
along the line we started calling it radar.
I have had experienced a situation with a very close friend that a
shadow literally popped in on us at the exact time her father passed
away. She was unable to see it and I was. It literally scared the @#$
out of me. I have been trying to figure out why he came to us and why
I was the only one to see this. I was hoping this technology would
help me understand the presences that come to me. I have no intentions
of using this for monetary gain or for other people, I just want to
understand the presences that come to me. Seems the older I get the
more prevalent they are.
Let me know your thoughts.
Michelle</pre>
