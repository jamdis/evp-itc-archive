<article class="msg-body">
<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am a fairly quiet person, most of the time. I have my thoughts and
opinions on topics but feel strongly about &quot;to each his own&quot;. Unless
something strikes me as completely wrong, I won&#x27;t debate. No one here
has heard from me other than recently with this mini-box yet, I am
here several times weekly reading and offering my energy in support of
the research.
However...something is striking me here and again, I can&#x27;t keep my
mouth shut. The discussion about the family hour with the box has led
the way for people to mention negativity and even &quot;the dark guys&quot; can
be fun if not taken seriously.
I ask you to consider the fact that many who purchase the mini-box
will not be of the right frame of mind. Most will not be in harmony.
Many will take &quot;the dark guys&quot; seriously. Yet, you feel it&#x27;s a good
idea to let anyone who wants a box have one? All in the name of
sharing technology.
I know that my previous posts expressing my concern over the mass
marketing of the box, was barely given consideration. Realize that I
am not being selfish- I do not own a box. EVP is my passion and has
been from day one 6 years ago when I jumped fully into the field. I am
successful in capturing EVP, always have been. I still do it the &quot;old
fashioned way&quot; with open air techniques. Would I love to be able to
hold real time 2 way communications with the other side? Of course.
However, I do not think enough research into the possibilities has
been done to warrant the approval let alone production of these boxes. 
Those of us who have been on countless investigations with many people
will quickly admit that there are some people we&#x27;d rather not
investigate with. When they are present, negative things tend to
happen. We all know one or two people who we can say &quot;felt dark&quot; from
the first meeting. We all admit that being mentally sound is an
important quality in this field. If you have mental issues, this may
not be the area of research for you. We don&#x27;t bring children on
investigations for obvious reasons. BUT! If you want a box that could
possibly open up a portal and bridge the gap between here and the
dark, sure! Anyone who wants one should have it! 
You might feel that I am over reacting or being overly dramatic.
That&#x27;s fine. My concern is not what you think of me but that you
consider the possibilities here. Many of which we do not know. Can you
be 100% sure that this is a good idea or that it&#x27;s worthy of saying
&quot;well, we&#x27;ll see what happens&quot;?

&gt; Bill,
&gt;  
&gt; You have the right idea, I recently have dealt with a lot
&gt; of negativity from my Frank&#x27;s box. Harmony is very important
&gt; as is the right frame of mind before turning the box on.
&gt;  
&gt; hope you &amp; the family had a good holiday.

&gt; Maybe we&#x27;re just a little unconventional in our household, but most
of us here are pretty open to the idea of the multiverse. Gathering in
a circle around our Frank&#x27;s Box is our idea of quality family time.
The messages are relevent, the interest is high, and we&#x27;re very well
grounded and do not let the tricksters push us around.Happy
Thanksgiving from our home to yours. -Bill
