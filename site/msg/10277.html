<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Normally, I do not respond to such emails but a few things need to be
set straight just so the newer members don&#x27;t think the comments that
have been made by Frank S, myself or anyone else are out of line. 

Bruce did leave on his own accord a couple months ago but only after
he was placed on probation and his posting rights taken away for being
nasty, belittling and insulting to several members. After many
warnings! He was let back in the group only after he privately emailed
the group owner, who through the kindness of her heart gave him
another chance.

Bruce has by his own words named himself the expert and in this own
words, &quot;contributed more to box research than anyone else&quot;. He
repeatedly called himself the best in the world at it and so on. That
is why Sumption could make the tongue-in-cheek remarks he made. He was
only repeating what Bruce had actually stated. If you don&#x27;t believe
me, do a search of the messages here and you will find it.

Apparently, Bruce also measures &quot;serious researchers&quot; by how much they
post or spout their drivel so lesser experienced experimenters will
look up to them as some leader. There is a point where helping someone
with a technique becomes guiding someone through the research. Let me
tell you, I have been in this research and other paranormal subject
for 15 years and I can promise you there are no experts despite what
TV will tell you. I will give my opinion and views if directly asked
but I will not interject my view and change yours just for name
recognition. It is best for you to take a little knowledge of a
technique and expand upon it in your own way. The method is not
important as the bond.

Now, you may hear from Bruce or a few people here will deliver this
response to him. He will say he is being talked about without the
opportunity to defend himself. I can&#x27;t really help that because he
already unsubscribed. Well, those who would like to can paste his
response anytime you want (as long as its not offensive). Nothing that
I have said is untrue or libel. Anything described here can be looked
up in our past messages and many can elaborate their own take on what
has been said.

Regards,

Frank R.

&gt; Kay,
&gt;  
&gt; Everything Frank R. just said I have been preaching for a year.
&gt; It is alway&#x27;s about the harmony and positive energy.
&gt;  
&gt; And anyone knows that the technology is just a way of getting the
message across.
&gt; The whole meaning of my post was misconscrued it was only meant to
spark some energy 
&gt; to move foward with all the research, technical and spiritual.
&gt;  
&gt; But sadly Kay my posts here are carefully scrutinised by some, and
the slightest miswording
&gt; or lack of clarity in a post will present certain people with the
opportunity to take a shot.
&gt;  
&gt; That is the reason I left this group a couple of months ago.
&gt; I returned hoping to help people, but when I try to pass on any
knowledge gained from experience
&gt; Some feel threatened and a nedd to countermine anything I say.
&gt;  
&gt; When was the last time you read a post From Frank R.
&gt;  
&gt; This post and a couple of others will probably not make it to the board.
&gt; If not you will all recieve private copies.

connection and the clarity&gt; of your messages depends on the strength
of the bond or bridge you&gt; develop with your friends on the otherside.
The equipment is only&gt; needed to materialize the message. This is why
you can use almost&gt; anything as a medium to bring them across.&gt; &gt; I
love to see people learn on their own through their own reasoning.&gt; &gt;

of all the responses I have heard Mike &gt; &gt; Edwards seem to get the
best reponses to his questions on his &gt; &gt; clickity 12-469 shack hack

the relationship you develop with the &gt; &gt; spirits. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kay&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

&lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt; wrote:&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Everyone,&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I would like to make a serious suggestion.&gt; &gt; &gt; As a senior
researcher in the live spirit communication field, &gt; &gt; Myself &gt; &gt; &gt;
and a few other researchers here such as Steve hultay, Ann, LC&gt; &gt; &gt;
Just to mention a couple have strived since the beginning to try &gt; &gt;
and &gt; &gt; &gt; advance the technology, communication and relations with our
&gt; &gt; spirit &gt; &gt; &gt; friends or whatever entities are participating in
this &gt; &gt; communication &gt; &gt; &gt; research.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In order to call
this research it must continue to move forward.&gt; &gt; &gt; There are more
than enough of the new people here, that do not &gt; &gt; &gt; qualify as new
people anymore. But full fledged researchers. Of &gt; &gt; &gt; course they
have much to learn, but so do we all.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which brings me to my
suggestion.&gt; &gt; &gt; Steve and I have recently been discussing the point
we have &gt; &gt; reached &gt; &gt; &gt; in the research, both in process and
knowledge. We agreed on most &gt; &gt; &gt; points,&gt; &gt; &gt; the most important one
being. It is time to move beyond the same &gt; &gt; &gt; mundane session
content and the same rudimentary line of &gt; &gt; questioning.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
This research is stagnating for lack of direction, any posted &gt; &gt;
files &gt; &gt; &gt; or discussions revolve around the same stale subjects such
as, &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Is there anyone there that wishes to communicate&quot;, &gt; &gt; &gt;
&quot;What is your name&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;who am I speaking with&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;what is it
like where you are&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I believe we have all received every
combination of answer to &gt; &gt; those &gt; &gt; &gt; questions that we possibly
can, yet we continue to ask them &gt; &gt; session &gt; &gt; &gt; after session. And
still become amazed at a yes or no answer or &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt; simplest of
phrases.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not saying this about any single level of
researcher but all &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; us myself included have fallen into
this rut. We are not learning &gt; &gt; &gt; anything, All our efforts are
amounting to nothing.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We already know that we are
communicating with someone or &gt; &gt; something. &gt; &gt; &gt; I believe we have
all come to believe that through our personal &gt; &gt; &gt; research and the
evidence presented by all of us.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Within the last year the
technology and potential of this type of &gt; &gt; &gt; research has exceeded
all expectations in it&#x27;s quality and speed &gt; &gt; of &gt; &gt; &gt; development.
We are actually letting it go to waste.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I and a few other
researchers believe that whoever is on the other &gt; &gt; &gt; side of the
line has had a hand in some of us developing this new &gt; &gt; &gt; equipment
and methods of research be it obvious or subtle.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But our
methods of research have not excelled, we are conducting &gt; &gt; &gt;
research in the same manner as we did when there where only about &gt; &gt;
5 &gt; &gt; &gt; of us in the whole world actively doing this research.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; New individuals are joining our ranks and becoming interested in &gt;
&gt; box &gt; &gt; &gt; research every day. The protocol they are being instructed
to use &gt; &gt; is &gt; &gt; &gt; antiquated and obsolete.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is fine to
teach them these methods as a basic foundation of &gt; &gt; the &gt; &gt; &gt;
research and to get their feet wet. But like any other education &gt; &gt; &gt;
process it must evolve and develop with the accumulation of &gt; &gt;
knowledge.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If we approached academic education the way we
approach box &gt; &gt; research, &gt; &gt; &gt; we would all still be in the first
grade.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I propose a committee to develop a method of
research and protocol &gt; &gt; &gt; that can deal with the ever evolving
technology and decide what &gt; &gt; and &gt; &gt; &gt; how we should approach the
type of communication we seek and the &gt; &gt; &gt; subject matter that should
be addressed, that will be continually &gt; &gt; &gt; changing.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only
in this way will the wheels of research and learning move &gt; &gt; &gt;
forward and we will gain the knowledge we seek and hopefully be &gt; &gt;
able &gt; &gt; &gt; to share it with the world someday.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But if we
continue to ask &quot;Is anyone there willing to speak with &gt; &gt; me&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; We
are doomed.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone that wishes to discuss this and give
opinions or suggestions&gt; &gt; &gt; please lets try and get started every
minute we waste is a missed &gt; &gt; &gt; opportunity for learning.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
