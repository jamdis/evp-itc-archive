I use x-bass speakers\n&gt; hooked up thru an equalizer to my pc so what I hear isnt\n&gt; always what others hear on thier systems. I am more\n&gt; surprised when they hear it the same as I do. When I listen\n&gt; to some voices on another speaker setup sometimes the voices\n&gt; tones are lost and cant hear anything, while others voice\n&gt; are well recieved on any setup. I am unsure why, nor am I\n&gt; sure why some days they come in clearer than others.\n&gt; \n&gt; As you requested heres a couple more water files from a\n&gt; recent session that I found to be very clear. I was\n&gt; discussing Otto and his &quot;replacement&quot; with them\n&gt; that week as well as running some experiments redoing a few\n&gt; audio/visual tests I&#39;d done in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; The session from the next day I was saying hello to my\n&gt; friends who have passed and asked they wish my mother a\n&gt; happy birthday for me that day. My birthday is a couple\n&gt; weeks away from hers so this year I guess its a happy\n&gt; birthday early (I can kinda hear early on the end of that\n&gt; one how about you?)\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 8/12/08, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] A few recent captures\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, August 12, 2008, 7:44 PM\n&gt; &gt; Misty, heard pretty much of what you did.  A few\n&gt; words not\n&gt; &gt; clear.  I found the water method surprisingly\n&gt; clear.  Full\n&gt; &gt; sentence, same tone for all words.  Like to hear\n&gt; more. \n&gt; &gt; Ron\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Mon, 8/11/08, Misty Dawn\n&gt; &gt; &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] A few recent captures\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Monday, August 11, 2008, 10:33 AM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Most of these are very clear for my ears how about\n&gt; you?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Notes*\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I wish I could build robotics too LOL but dont think\n&gt; so in\n&gt; &gt; this lifetime.
