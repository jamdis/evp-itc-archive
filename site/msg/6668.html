          Hi Ann. I'm a MAC user (OS 10.4.x). I don't know if you use Audacity, but that program 
will change your audio output from 44100Hz to 96000Hz. This will prevent sound from 
working on some sites. For me, YouTube is a good example. I have to reset my sound 
almost every time after using Audacity (I've created a shortcut on my desktop to make it 
quick and easy).

I don't know if this will work for you, but try this path: Applications > Utilities > Audio 
MIDI Setup (launch this application). Then on the right side, under the words "Audio 
Output" there is a pulldown menu after the word FORMAT. If it isn't 44100Hz, change it to 
this setting. It took me forever and day to figure out what the problem was on my 
system. Hope it works for you. If this doesn't work, I'm out of suggestions. ;-) Margaret

that and see if it will let ya download. If the website is not loading for you at all then 
definitely a browser conflict. But the downloads should work same as they do on this
