It sounds like a tricky situation, and I'm not sure what to suggest. I supp=
ose one route is to, as you suggest, just walk away from all this.=A0 I gue=
ss you have to look at the big picture and decide if it's worth the frustra=
tion, the stress, and the angst, especially what it does to your health.=A0=
 Nothing is worth throwing your health away over.=A0 

Even dropping all th=
is, just for a while, might also tell you if any health problems you are ex=
periencing might be being aggravated by all the drama.=A0 And it might have=
 the side effect of letting all the negativity and egos out there burn them=
selves out, so if you do look back into things a while down the road, it co=
uld be a prettier picture then.

Other than a full retreat, I don't think a=
nything else would make a difference other than a full attack: creating, fo=
r=A0 instance, good objective standards for evaluation and test of the tech=
nology and results, which the shows and 'experts' seem to find anathema.=A0=
 Then, if their claims were to be confronted by such standards, they'd find=
 themselves unable to stand up to them, and eventually, hopefully, be embar=
rassed back into obscurity.

That is an interesting observation. I =
think the core of the issue is that there seems to be a `sweet spot' in par=
anormal beliefs where there is just enough science, just enough technical b=
acking, just enough paranormal claims, and just enough indefinite evidence =
that keeps people interested in the ghost hunting mentality


Evidence whic=
h becomes too indefinite turns off most people. As they become more aware o=
f sensitives who simply make claims ("I feel there is a GHOST here!"), but =
provide no evidence other than statements, people eventually get bored. Sim=
ilarly, people eventually grow tired of the anthropomorphism of every littl=
e occurrence in a house: a creak implies a footstep, which implies a person=
, which, if not seen, implies a ghost. But a creak does not equal a footste=
p.


And while this kind of indefinite evidence can lose an audience, so ca=
n evidence that is claimed to be "obviously" evident by technology. Here, t=
he investigator is no longer making vague claims, but waving science around=
, like FLIR cameras, or EMF meters, and then making proclamations of the re=
sults. But again, people eventually see these are just lights and sounds fr=
om electronics, and investigators making more claims. It's like the psychic=
s again, but with visual aids.


I think the reason EVP studies are not sec=
uring more interest, as you noted, are a little of both effects. First is t=
he anthropomorphism problem: I notice many EVP experimenters proclaim what =
their results sound like, or name the sound file by what they've heard. But=
 like the creaks, "sounds like" does not equal "is". This is then compounde=
d by the technology backing: regardless of how valid the EVP researcher's r=
esults are, the technology can seem intimidating, but the researchers often=
 proclaim the obviousness of their results. People again become turned off =
by it because it is not obvious to them, and in the end it is just another =
piece of technology presenting sounds, with no obvious connection to the pa=
ranormal, except by the claims and interpretations of the presenters.


I b=
elieve, taking these issues into account, there is a way for EVP studies to=
 garner more interest. For now, the analysis coming from the researchers us=
ually seems like a claim, and it is these claims, imho, that is being class=
ified by the public with the rest of the paranormal claims, and so, it also=
 becomes less of an interest. A new approach could be one without the claim=
s and interpretations of the investigators, one where the sounds are simply=
 played and not labeled. The interpretation of the data could be left to th=
e listeners. Web sites which present EVPs could be developed where people c=
ould not see others interpretations until they entered their own. I think t=
his would be such a novel approach, that it would give the public a better =
feeling of true involvement in the research, and feel less like they are si=
mply being exposed to the claims of others. And I think that feeling of inv=
olvement is what is needed to reignited the public interest here.
