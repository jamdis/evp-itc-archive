<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am curious if anyone with a microphone wired to a remote site has ever
gotten any EVP in real time.

I took part in an investigation of Ashmore Estates, near Ashmore IL, on
Saturday night. We had six video cameras set up in the three halls of the
building. The video for all was being monitored and recorded at a central
location. Alas, we did not have microphones at the camera sites conected to
the central location. I wonder what we might have heard if we did?
