t definitely is harder. The biggest thing I can recommend is to not remove =
the bottom board. If you can tear only the front section of the radio and k=
eep the bottom intact, you will fare better. Simply undo the top little boa=
rd that has the LCD window (4 clips), flip it back, and punch out the 7th w=
ire from the right. A Bruce mentioned, you will need to be careful with the=
 two little buttons up top for the light and SW button (that you don't need=
). You may be able to hold them in place with a toothpick for each one when=
 you pop the board up. If you lose them in the radio, don't worry about it.=
 Let it go and re-assemble. The radio will work just fine for you.As Steve =
mentioned earlier, the shortwave sweeps slow, unless you hold it in. The AM=
 and FM sweep like the RS12-470 (older version). Clean sweep - nice unit. I=
f I get some time, I took some pictures of what it looks like opened up. I =
can post them on here for you to see. Are we gonna' call this "Steve's Box,=
