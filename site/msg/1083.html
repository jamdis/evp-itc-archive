<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, there&#x27;s somekind of propagation effect, but I&#x27;ve never thought of 
trying to record before the bands open. I&#x27;ve tried to record while the ham 
bands were open, and it didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference. I have noticed 
though that when I first started using my boxes I was getting voices coming 
in like gangbusters as they say, but it tapered off to almost nothing by 
comparison, as did the ham bands with the solar cycle dropping. ( me&#x27;s a 
extra class ham).

I have my new board all working up to the audio amps, there&#x27;s seems to be an 
impedance mismatch between the tuner and the amplifiers. I&#x27;m working on a 
buffer to place in between them.

I made the sweep frequency adjustment a panel mount control, so it can be 
changed depending onthe band being used, and the conditions that are 
apparent by the way the voices come in.
