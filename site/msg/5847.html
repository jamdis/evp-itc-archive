<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ron,

I visited Mayan ruins in the Progresso/Merida region about 5 years 
ago...fascinating to me and very spiritual.

I just want to encourage you.  Set-up a certain time to run sessions 
weekly.  Let&#x27;s say you could do it Monday -Thursday at 10:00 AM for 
example.  This way, an expectation is set and a plan is in order.  
Keep recording small sessions and then analyze them.  Ask questions, 
simple basic questions for responses each day.  Don&#x27;t give up.  I 
pesonally have noticed this has helped me and something is building 
with the contacts and quality of the messages.  For me it began with 
a staggered &quot;Yes,&quot; and other one words occasionally.  Now I am 
hearing sentences and very intelligable responses that I know are not 
radio bit coincidences.  The biggest help any of us can give you is 
to remain patient and continue experimenting, looking for not only 
what works for you, but giving those on the other side time to find 
you and get a message or two across.  It will come - I am certain of 
it.

For some reason, the amount of audio bits seem to help with the 
communication, as I can tell...even when I have received EVP-like 
messages above or over the audio bits in the background.  I do not 
understand why.  Here are two ideas I have for you to pick up more AM 
audio:

1) Try an AM antenna booster (Radio Shack sells them.  I think Juli 
has had some success with hers).
2) You may try more than one hacked radio sweeping at different 
places on the band.  Pipe the audio through a mixer, and output it 
through amplified speakers or directly into the recorder.  This way, 
you wil have audio bits throughout - even if you have to use 3 radios 
to do it.

&gt; Laura   I am on the Yucatan peninsula.  The very tip of the 
peninsula is about a two hour drive for me.   Nowhere near 
Brownsville, Texas.  I need to fly out of here which usually takes me 
from Merida to Houston or Florida.  Stop on by.  Ron

&gt;           Thanks all for getting back so quickly.  It probably 
makes me feel a bit better if nothing is on the recording since I 
don&#x27;t seem to pick anything up anyway.  The &quot;Ask Bruce is a bit of 
surprise only because I already did ask bruce.  He had suggested I 
try a direct recording.  
&gt; 
&gt;     
&gt; 
&gt;     This actually brings up a question about what Steve hears.  Is 
it possible that you are getting a message given to you at the time 
you are listening to my recording which actually does not have the 
message?  I must say I am still overwhelmed from getting messages on 
the other evp maker recording (that others hear).   My pea brain and 
body are still processing that information.  
&gt;

&gt;     I think this was about 40 sec. in, i slowed it down a bit.

&gt;               I have posted a direct recording in my file under 
RS12-469 Direct Recording.  This may be a good opportunity to get 
help with my technical challange here in Mexico.  I have posted what 
I recorded from AM signals along the beach here on the Gulf with the 
recorder patched directly into the RS 12 469.  Most channels are 
Spanish language although one or two channels skip across the Gulf 
fromTexas.  So you shouldn&#x27;t hear many English words from the radio 
if any.
&gt; 
&gt;     
&gt; 
&gt;     I am submitting this because, with the help of this group, I 
recently learned that I have been missing all the messages on my 
recordings.  That is...I couldn&#x27;t hear anything where others with 
experience hear plenty.
&gt; 
&gt;     
&gt; 
&gt;     My previous post was with EVP make r.  If somethng could be 
heard on the RS recording patched directly into my recorder that 
would be another amazing event for me.  I of course hear nothing from 
the other side.  Ron L
