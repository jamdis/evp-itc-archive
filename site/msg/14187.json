An audio file is just a file of bytes, that is later interpreted by an=\r\n audio player.  Two files with the exact same contents, whether they are au=\r\ndio or image or a dababase or an exe, are indistinguishable from each other=\r\n.  That is, if I copied the contents of one to a new file, and the contents=\r\n of the other to a new file, and asked you which file each came from, there=\r\n would be no way to tell.  Even the audio player could not tell.  The data =\r\nis identical, and so the sound (or the picture, etc) would be identical.\n\n =\r\n       Yes I did listen to the results, but that is not the best test (they=\r\n sounded identical, but that is a subjective opinion).  The real test is co=\r\nmpring the contents.

However, for wav files, the compression during email is not loss =\r\nless. \n\n                    I used to think as you do, in that the emailed =\r\nattachment of a wav file would not loose anything. After a lengthy discours=\r\ne with another member here, I learned that I was wrong. The reason why I di=\r\nd not realize it in the first place is that when I would email a wav file, =\r\nI would intentionally keep it in very small segments, to keep file size dow=\r\nn. This was just for ease of transfer. But because of this, I had not exper=\r\nienced any noticeable loss.\n\n                    Now it may be in some case=\r\ns, depending on the servers or what have you that the file goes through, th=\r\nat the loss may be less or more. But once the attachment is downloaded, the=\r\n quality has been found to be less then the original wav.\n\n                =\r\n    Again though you can only really tell when the wav file is large.\n\n    =\r\n                ----- Original Message ----- \n                      From: R=\r\nj \n                      To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com \n                    =\r\n  Sent: Sunday, May 10, 2009 1:36 PM\n                      Subject: Re: [EV=\r\nP-ITC] File uploading rules\n\n\n                            The kind of compr=\r\nession that occurs during an email attachment is &quot;lossless&quot;: it compress th=\r\ne file cleverly without losing information.  For example, if I had a progra=\r\nm in some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it could compress it.  But =\r\nif it lost even one bit, the resulting exe file would not execute again aft=\r\ner it was uncompressed on the other side.\n\n                            This=\r\n kind of compression does things like looking for common patterns in the fi=\r\nle, and replacing them with a token.  A rough example would be if it found =\r\n&quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot; in a file 20 times, it could replace all the occurances wi=\r\nth say $HN1.  And also write a little dictionary in there someplace that sa=\r\nys &quot;$HN1=3DHowdy Neighbor&quot;.\n\n                            When the file gets=\r\n to its destination it can be uncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are =\r\nreplaced with &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot;.  So it was compressed (instead of 14 charac=\r\nters each, it only needed 4, plus the dictionary), but lost no data.\n\n     =\r\n                       Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not lossless.  =\r\nDepending on the level of compression, some level of data is lost, and so c=\r\nannot be recovered or reconstructed later.\n\n                            Ric=\r\nk\n\n\n\n                            --- On Sun, 5/10/09, April Abercrombie &lt;ap=\r\nril@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n                              =\r\nFrom: April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt;\n            =\r\n                  Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n             =\r\n                 To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n                             =\r\n Date: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 10:26 AM\n\n\n\n                              Anot=\r\nher thing:\n\n                              I recently found this out. When y=\r\nou email a file, if it is not saved as a compressed format, the email filte=\r\nring process will actually compress the file automatically.\n\n              =\r\n                So even if you have attached a wav. file, it will loose res=\r\nolution over the email process. It will not sound exactly the same as the o=\r\nriginal wav. file. How much it differs depends on the size of the file you =\r\nare attaching. If it is a very large file, it will sound much different.\n\n =\r\n                             The only exception to this is if the wav. file=\r\n is small enough that the filtering process will ignore it. It has to be pr=\r\netty small though, like under 1 MB (I am not exactly sure of the threshold)=\r\n.\n\n                              The best way to share files over the inter=\r\nnet if you want them as close to the original as possible is to upload them=\r\n directly to a website.\n\n                                ----- Original Mes=\r\nsage ----- \n                                From: Rj \n                     =\r\n           To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com \n                                Se=\r\nnt: Sunday, May 10, 2009 10:54 AM\n                                Subject: =\r\nRe: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n\n\n\n                                Pixel=\r\nization doesn&#39;t clean-up the data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking a pictur=\r\ne of a field of flowers, and beginning to add levels or pixelization to the=\r\n picture.  Soon, you would not be able to tell there were flowers there at =\r\nall.  You would see a lot of colored blocks.\n\n                             =\r\n   Or in the other direction, imagine you are looking at a competely random=\r\nize bunch of pixes on your screen: a complete screen of truely random stati=\r\nc snow.  Pixelizing this, after a while, you would again start to see color=\r\ned blocks.\n\n                                What&#39;s happening is that it is =\r\nprocessing an area of the image, taking (for instance) the average value of=\r\n that entire area, and replacing all the blocks in that area with the avera=\r\nge.  In video processing, this would result in a field of multi-colored flo=\r\nwers being replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish block, with no r=\r\nesemblance to flowers.  In the noise example, it maybe replace all the rand=\r\nom pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.  If you did not know befor=\r\nehand what the original picture was, you couldn&#39;t tell whether your pixeliz=\r\ned image was really a field of flowers, a chevy, the sky with clouds, or a =\r\nrandom bunch of pixels.\n\n                                It works the same =\r\nwith the sound files.  Taking something as complex as speech, and replacing=\r\n frequencies with their averages, loses the speech the farther you go, unti=\r\nl you head strange fluctuating square waves.  Doing the same to random stat=\r\nic will eventually produce the same thing.

This was \n                 =\r\n   just for ease of transfer. But because of this, I had not \n             =\r\n       experienced any noticeable loss.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                    &lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                 =\r\n   &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;Now it may be in some \n         =\r\n           cases, depending on the servers or what have you that the \n     =\r\n               file goes through, that the loss may be less or more.
