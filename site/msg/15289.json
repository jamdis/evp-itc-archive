But, i could never get it to work. It didn&#39;t take out the clicking, i should be so lucky.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yeah that clicking noise is maddening Steve. Theres never a doubt when you hear it as to what they are using. Bill/Sum was sending out chips to solder into the 469 that actually got rid of that clicking but I&#39;m not sure what it was. Frank Ratka may remember he sent him one along with others. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Steve is right tho he hasmodified much better models that sound much smoother!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Misty\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
