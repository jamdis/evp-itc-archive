I like to happy thing,but doing this for 30+ years I've learned how to get =

results....Youll pick up friendly responses when being aggressive.Do you h=
ave a 
digital recorder ? 1 that you can download to your PC......$40.00 at=
 Best Buy / 
radio shack....UsIf your using the box only,u HEED to get a re=
corder.Use that 
without the box and see what you get..Did you record anyth=
ing to hear?????

=C2=A0 
wow,that is some sto=
ry...
I'm not sure that I am ready to act like that or that it is even in m=
y nature to 
act like that... and yes, I know all about how the presence of=
 fear is something 
that others feed off of, (and especially the lives ones=
, not just the dead ones, 
lol) which would make it even more difficult bec=
ause to say I am not afraid 
would be a lie... 

However, if the aggressive=
ness technique works for you, then it is good to know 
how to use it. Perha=
ps it is a good attitude to keep in the back of my mind, for 
times when/if=
 it feels as if something is trying to be aggressive towards *us.* 
For def=
ense, rather than offense. Although in your case, it could be described 
as=
 proactive defense, lol. Owning them before they own you, lol...

The guy t=
hat we did the first ghost box session with says that he gets the best 
act=
ivity from when he projects a happy-go-lucky, relaxed and merry attitude. 
=


I guess use whatever works!
