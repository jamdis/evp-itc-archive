Gender has little to do with it. 90% of everything I do, I have \nno idea why, it&#39;s all intuition based, I live moment to moment, there \nis no plan. I can only make just so many of these things, I&#39;m not a \ncompany, I can&#39;t just whip them out, especailly since I refuse to go \ndown that slippery road of making money off spirit. I have already \npast the point where I dread working on them. \n\n There&#39;s nothing special about the box, it simply provides the raw \naudio sprits/entities use to form voices. There are a number of \nmethods that result in much clearer, much more coherent messages. So \nfar, in my opinion, the box is piss poor at best. It works, but it \ncould be a hell of alot better. The Mini Box is better, and I think I \nprefer that direct mode of operation, and have incorporated it into \ntwo boxes as experiments in development. I get much more consistent \ncontacts from EVPmaker, which was invented long before the box. \n\n The only thing most know about the box is what&#39;s put out in public \nshows, and 90% of that is crapola.  \n\n Frank"}
