<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Robin, my personal experience sounds very much like yours, including  
the lingering tiredness. Frankly, I also end up quite cranky for a  
day or so. I thought at first that all this was a coincidence, but it  
happens every time I run a session. I&#x27;m not very fond of box  
&quot;hangover,&quot; but I doubt it will put me off continuing.

&gt; I would guess it&#x27;s very common because it&#x27;s literally a spiritual- 
&gt; mental-emotional-physical energy drain.  For the last two nights  
&gt; I&#x27;ve been listening to my hacked radios in my motel room, without  
&gt; recording, just to get in-tuned with them.  I&#x27;ve gotten totally  
&gt; ovewhelmed with exhaustion both times, to the point of having to  
&gt; stop within 10 minutes.  I agree that it&#x27;s not related to physical  
&gt; stamina.  The sessions are draining for them on the other side too,  
&gt; right?  Do you recover from your tiredness momentarily or does it  
&gt; take some time?  I&#x27;ve felt kind of &quot;hung over&quot; the next day, and  
&gt; the tiredness is lingering.

&gt; I get very very tired from my sessions. I try to keep them to 10 min.
&gt; because of this. Please remember I run marathons and have been a ham
&gt; for over 20 years so I can listen to the radio for hours on end. I am
&gt; not certain why this is happening. Just wondering if anybody has this
&gt; problem.
&gt; Rob.
