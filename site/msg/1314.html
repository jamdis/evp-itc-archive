<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>hi guy&#x27;s
It seems that franks box and the sweep method are not to poular with 
a few closed minded and self appointed paranormal truth seekers in 
other words individuals who can not accomplish anything on thier own 
as far as paranormal research is concerned so they feel they must 
lash out at others who open mindedly try new and mostly unexplored 
methods od spirit communication and investigation. they have no basis 
for thier attacks but to say I work in the electronics field and 
franks box is impossible it can not work and the am sweep is just 
catching bits of words that your mind is naturaly putting together as 
phrases. What I would like them to explain is how the messages 
recieved in this manner pertain to my individual life , family and 
name and how can anyone explain what is so far to my knowledge 
unexplainable. Anyway enough venting. This began as a good hearted 
post on another paranormal forum in hopes of spurring some 
researchers like myself that were unaware of these methods to maybe 
give them a try. I was immediatly attacked like by a pack of wolves 
claiming to be so called electronic experts and self appointed 
debunkers of fraud when all I did was to explain my experience with 
the method and not to give a fact based report on it&#x27;s validity but 
to give my personal experience with it. WHY CAN&#x27;T WE ALL JUST GET 
ALONG !!!
