They \nare grey and white, and come in a box that is either white and \nmagenta or white and red...\nIf they are the old, I will get both and give them away for cost only \nto someone that needs one.  I&#39;ll just wait to find out who in time.\nThanks for the info.  \n~ Laura\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Laura, \n&gt;  \n&gt; first make sure they are old model 470&#39;s\n&gt; they should be white and silver and come packaged in a box not \n&gt; all black with clear plastic packaging.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If they are the old model 470 definatelly take the two of them.\n&gt; there are not only new people but some vets that would want a spare.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is a miricle you found any at all. I believed the country was \npicked clean.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Just don&#39;t let the sales man tell you &quot;yes we have them&quot; quite a few\n&gt; people called and where assured of what the store had, only to \ntravel there and\n&gt; find the new model 470. most of the time the sales person will just \nlook at the \n&gt; part number and say yes we have them.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday"}
