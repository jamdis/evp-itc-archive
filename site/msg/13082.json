I can hardly hear\nanything over them chatting.  Also I notice a cpl of their people\nfreak out when they get knocks or other responses... nobody ever says\nhey thanks for the effort you put into responding or great job or\nanything like that..its always wtf was that, what the hell is going on\nin here, etc...do ya&#39;ll say thanks and compliment the efforts of the\nresponding spirits?  Ive never been on an investigation with a team so\nIm kinda curious how different groups work and run things.(wish I knew\npeople in arizona I could go on an investigation with)  I know when I\ndo my research here with my radio shack hack I always say thanks and\nam polite and have never freaked out or cussed in response to one of\nthe responses Ive gotten.  Anyways just curious.  Hope everyone has a\ngreat weekend!\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Rhonda\n&gt;"}
