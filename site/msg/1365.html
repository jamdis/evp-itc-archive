<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>A big hello to everyone,
I am the founder of the circle uk evp group
I have been recording Evp and capturing images for awhile now
Mind you i seem now to be hitting a blank wall with my images these 
past few months as i am working on a transparent method in the loop
Frustration can be an understatment on bad days,lol.
So i thought i would get a wee bit of advice on these other techniques 
people are now using,I also work with water and results there seem to 
be getting on fine.
I am not very techie minded although i try:-)
On the Evp side of things i have no problems as i get good/bad days 
like anyone else.

  Take Care
