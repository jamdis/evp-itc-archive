When I first started recording EVP a couple of \n =\r\n &gt; years ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when it \n  &gt; hap=\r\npened to me I felt elated rather than frightened or \n  distressed. I \n  &gt; w=\r\nill ask again: What physical or psychic harm is a disembodied \n  &gt; entity c=\r\napable of doing? Please listen to the one EVP I&#39;ve posted \n  on \n  &gt; this b=\r\noard and tell me what, if anything, you hear. I know what I \n  &gt; hear, and =\r\nI consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is the \n  &gt; response that h=\r\nas created the determination in me to continue \n  &gt; researching the unknown=\r\n. \n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings. I only want to learn=\r\n as \n  &gt; much as I can from you and the other dedicated researchers on \n  t=\r\nhis \n  &gt; board. It never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in the \n=\r\n  &gt; past, and that&#39;s about all I can say. I will probably use one \n  from \n=\r\n  &gt; this point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract \n  &gt; goodn=\r\ness. \n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; So, thank you for this contribution. I think the debate =\r\nhas \n  been \n  &gt; an excellent one, and I&#39;ve appreciated the opportunity to =\r\nbe \n  &gt; enlightened.\n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; Robin\n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; ----- Or=\r\niginal Message ----- \n  &gt; &gt; From: bhali333 \n  &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt; \n  &gt;=\r\n &gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 16, 2008 8:06 AM\n  &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] this =\r\ndamned protection debate\n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; I swore I would not get wraped=\r\n up in this debateBUT!The reason \n  I \n  &gt; came up with this whole protecti=\r\non ritual was that some of the \n  new \n  &gt; researchers whereexpressing a ra=\r\ntional concern for negative \n  responces \n  &gt; that they were recieving thro=\r\nugh thier boxes.The short protection \n  &gt; ritual that I posted is not meant=\r\n to quell irrational histerical \n  &gt; fear, and I agreewith rosemary that an=\r\nyone suffering from such \n  fear \n  &gt; should rethink thier involment in the=\r\n paranormal research \n  field.that \n  &gt; being said, It was only meant as a =\r\nsource of subliminal comfort \n  to \n  &gt; those new individuals that had neve=\r\nr expperienced spiritual \n  &gt; negativity. And to help ease them into aproac=\r\nhing a session \n  &gt; eventually with confidenceand determination as well as =\r\nfull \n  &gt; curiousity for all types of the communication we recieve.My \n  in=\r\nitial \n  &gt; post of the ritual file was done with the best of intentions and=\r\n \n  &gt; meant to be another tool available for those who felt they needed \n  =\r\nor \n  &gt; wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer ritual, I \n  do=\r\nn&#39;t \n  &gt; think it is really worthy of all this debate.Use it, don&#39;t use \n  =\r\nit. \n  &gt; It&#39;s there if you want it. Also I must say there are two kinds of =\r\n\n  &gt; fear the kind that is natural and a god given emotion for self \n  &gt; pr=\r\neservation, ie the fright and flight reflex that is an \n  instinctive \n  &gt; =\r\ntrait in all of us. Then you have the irrational dibilitating \n  phobic \n  =\r\n&gt; fear that can turn an individual into a frozen statue. That type \n  of \n =\r\n &gt; fear I believe is unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt with \n  and=\r\n \n  &gt; learned how to harness. I also believe that anyone that harbors \n  th=\r\nat \n  &gt; type of fear would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a \n=\r\n  &gt; case of such fear it would already be present and doing a small \n  &gt; pr=\r\notection ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take it \n  for \n  &gt; =\r\nwhat it is, something to utilize in our box of tools like an emf \n  &gt; meter=\r\n.you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the bottom of \n  &gt; your tool=\r\n box at home that you inherited from your grandfather \n  and \n  &gt; have neve=\r\nr usedbut if you come across that odd nut that needs \n  &gt; tightening someds=\r\ny you will be glad you have it.Bruce\n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; Need to know the score, t=\r\nhe latest news, or you need your \n  Hotmail=AE-\n  &gt; get your &quot;fix&quot; Check it=\r\n out. \n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; ______=\r\n____________________________________________________\n  &gt; &gt; Climb to the top=\r\n of the charts!

To give any individual \n  that w=\r\nants to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; anopportunity to use it.

When I fi=\r\nrst started recording EVP a couple of \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; years ago I was warned to=\r\n expect negative responses, so when it \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; happened to me I felt el=\r\nated rather than frightened or \n  &lt;BR&gt;distressed. I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; will ask again=\r\n: What physical or psychic harm is a \n  disembodied &lt;BR&gt;&gt; entity capable=\r\n of doing? Please listen to the one EVP \n  I&#39;ve posted &lt;BR&gt;on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; this=\r\n board and tell me what, if anything, you \n  hear. I know what I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; h=\r\near, and I consider it distinctly threatening; \n  yet, this is the &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n response that has created the determination in me to \n  continue &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nresearching the unknown. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bruce, \n  I am in awe =\r\nof your recordings. I only want to learn as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; much as I can \n  from =\r\nyou and the other dedicated researchers on &lt;BR&gt;this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; board. It \n  n=\r\never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; past, and \n =\r\n that&#39;s about all I can say. I will probably use one &lt;BR&gt;from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; this=\r\n \n  point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract &lt;BR&gt;&gt; goodne=\r\nss. \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; So, thank you for this contribution. I t=\r\nhink the \n  debate has &lt;BR&gt;been &lt;BR&gt;&gt; an excellent one, and I&#39;ve appreci=\r\nated the \n  opportunity to be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; enlightened.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; \n  Robin&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----- O=\r\nriginal \n  Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: bhali333 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;A =\r\n\n  title=3Dmailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yah=\r\noogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;mailto:EVP-&lt;WBR&gt;ITC%40yah=\r\noogroup&lt;WBR&gt;s.com&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 16, 2008 8:=\r\n06 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: \n  [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debate&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; I swore I would not get wraped up i=\r\nn this debateBUT!The reason &lt;BR&gt;I \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; came up with this whole prote=\r\nction ritual was that some of the \n  &lt;BR&gt;new &lt;BR&gt;&gt; researchers whereexpr=\r\nessing a rational concern for negative \n  &lt;BR&gt;responces &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that they =\r\nwere recieving through thier boxes.The short \n  protection &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ritual =\r\nthat I posted is not meant to quell irrational \n  histerical &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fear,=\r\n and I agreewith rosemary that anyone suffering from \n  such &lt;BR&gt;fear &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; should rethink thier involment in the paranormal \n  research &lt;BR&gt;field.=\r\nthat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; being said, It was only meant as a source of \n  subliminal co=\r\nmfort &lt;BR&gt;to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; those new individuals that had never \n  expperienced =\r\nspiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; negativity. And to help ease them into \n  aproaching a s=\r\nession &lt;BR&gt;&gt; eventually with confidenceand determination as \n  well as f=\r\null &lt;BR&gt;&gt; curiousity for all types of the communication we \n  recieve.My=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;initial &lt;BR&gt;&gt; post of the ritual file was done with the best \n  of =\r\nintentions and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; meant to be another tool available for those who \n =\r\n felt they needed &lt;BR&gt;or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; wanted to employ it. it is a simple innoc=\r\nent \n  prayer ritual, I &lt;BR&gt;don&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;&gt; think it is really worthy of all=\r\n this \n  debate.Use it, don&#39;t use &lt;BR&gt;it. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It&#39;s there if you want i=\r\nt. Also I \n  must say there are two kinds of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fear the kind that is=\r\n natural and a \n  god given emotion for self &lt;BR&gt;&gt; preservation, ie the =\r\nfright and flight \n  reflex that is an &lt;BR&gt;instinctive &lt;BR&gt;&gt; trait in al=\r\nl of us. Then you have \n  the irrational dibilitating &lt;BR&gt;phobic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; f=\r\near that can turn an \n  individual into a frozen statue. That type &lt;BR&gt;of &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; fear I believe is \n  unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt wit=\r\nh &lt;BR&gt;and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; learned how \n  to harness. I also believe that anyone th=\r\nat harbors &lt;BR&gt;that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; type of \n  fear would not be drawn to the para=\r\nnormal anyway and in a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; case of \n  such fear it would already be pr=\r\nesent and doing a small &lt;BR&gt;&gt; protection \n  ritual would not fuel it any=\r\n further. So lets take it &lt;BR&gt;for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; what it \n  is, something to util=\r\nize in our box of tools like an emf &lt;BR&gt;&gt; meter.you \n  may have an old r=\r\nusty odd sized wrench at the bottom of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; your tool box \n  at home th=\r\nat you inherited from your grandfather &lt;BR&gt;and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; have never \n  usedb=\r\nut if you come across that odd nut that needs &lt;BR&gt;&gt; tightening somedsy \n=\r\n  you will be glad you have it.Bruce&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Need to kno=\r\nw the \n  score, the latest news, or you need your &lt;BR&gt;Hotmail=AE-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; g=\r\net your &quot;fix&quot; \n  Check it out. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n  ____________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;___=\r\n______&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; Climb to the top of the charts! =\r\nPlay the word scramble &lt;BR&gt;challenge \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; with star power.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;A \n  title=3Dhttp://club.live.com/star_shuffle.aspx? \n  href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/club.live.com/star_shuffle.aspx?&quot;&gt;http://club.&lt;WBR&gt;live.com/&lt;WBR&gt;star_shuf=\r\nfle.&lt;WBR&gt;aspx?&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;&lt;A \n  title=3Dhttp://club.live.com/star_shuffleas=\r\npx? \n  href=3D&quot;http://club.live.com/star_shuffleaspx?&quot;&gt;http://club.&lt;WBR&gt;liv=\r\ne.com/&lt;WBR&gt;star_shuffleaspx&lt;WBR&gt;?&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  icid=3Dstarshuffle_&lt;WB=\r\nR&gt;wlmailtextlink_&lt;WBR&gt;jan&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--End =\r\ngroup email --&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00FD_01C859EF.F3147880--"}
