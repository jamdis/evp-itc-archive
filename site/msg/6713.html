Frank, 
               The more sessions I do, I have come to find that every session is completely different as far as voices.  I once believed that I had a so called tec, but I have not heard the voice he identifies himself as in about a month.  I also don't think that you have to ask any questions at all to get messages that if there is something intended for you to hear or record, you'll get it.  
   
                  I think its ok to ask questions during a session, and unless your answers are backed up with factual data (known to be fact) you have to take it at face value.  I would like to believe that what we are getting in the 2 way communication was acturate and truthful, but the fact is, for the most part I can not confirm one way or another.  I just go with the flow and hope that the audio I walk away with is good.

I do not know who or what communicates. I am unwilling to jump on 
the higher spirit band wagon, as they seemly produce nothing useful, 
very little verifiable information, nothing that makes life better, 
nothing that helps me make better boxes. I know only that something 
talks that shouldn't be there, and that keeps me intrigued. As Sun 
Bear used to say, "They don't grow any corn".

I have a "group" that insists I am their Space Princess, now how 
wise is it to just accept what they say, without question, being that 
I am niether female, nor Royalty!

Curious that I make the boxes, but my input about it's use is so 
easily dismissed.

There is at the very least, multiple levels that can be contacted, 
some very manipulative, perhaps demonic if you want to go down that 
road. If you want them to tell you how great you are, they will 
certainly do so, that is why the caution.

I've probably asked you this a half dozen times over the last couple 
of years, but who or what do YOU think you're/we're communicating 
with?
