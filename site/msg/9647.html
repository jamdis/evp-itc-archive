<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>So try this on for size.. Evil or good I don&#x27;t care and am not afraid
of anything or anyone.  I will communicate with all spirits, if I can.
 Fear is why you say and believe what you do, your fear is not

&gt; 2. Dangers which Mankind faces if SPIRICOM is not used wisely
&gt; 
&gt; Since his beginnings, Man has been faced with the fact that
&gt; individually and collectively he has the power to act for good or
&gt; evil. As his knowledge of the energetic nature of the cosmos has
&gt; expanded, Man has found that every energy so far identified -- from
&gt; sexual energy to atomic energy -- can be used for his benefit or for
&gt; his downfall. He will find that the energies involved in SPIRICOM are
&gt; also of a nature that can be used to help him grow mentally and
&gt; spiritually and become more God-like (that is more like the beings on
&gt; the higher planes) or they can be focused on trivia which will make it
&gt; even harder for him to grow out of the present deplorable mess in
&gt; which Western civilization&#x27;s social, economic and political actions
&gt; are tending toward disintegration.
&gt; 
&gt; ----------------
&gt; 
&gt;     * For the spiritually oriented, we report some advice given by
&gt; high level spirit communicators: If SPIRICOM researchers adhere to the
&gt; following procedure they will not suffer possession by negative
&gt; forces. First thing in the morning say, &quot;I will wear the protective
&gt; cloak of the Christ light until I retire tonight.&quot; On retiring make a
&gt; similar decree for the night hours. (Note: The Christ light is said to
&gt; have overshadowed and inspired Jesus of Nazareth continually during
&gt; the last three years of his earth life.)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just finished box number 3.  And yes that&#x27;s a trifield meter
built in.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  It seems to work great.  Once the meter shows any EMF field at all
&gt; &gt; &gt; the box starts to spit out the allophones.  The meter also has a
very
&gt; &gt; &gt; sensitive antenna and it is tied together with the
&gt; &gt; &gt;  A to D converter antenna that I use to get the emf into the box.
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is by far the most sensitive of the three boxes.  If you are
&gt; &gt; &gt; building your own just let me know if you need any info.  I will of
&gt; &gt; &gt; course upload audio files as I get them.  I did have a few headaches
&gt; &gt; &gt; with this box as I am driving the LM386 all the way up.  Somehow the
&gt; &gt; &gt; audio was getting back into the negative bus!  Took a couple
hours to
&gt; &gt; &gt; get the right capacitor for the ground shunt.  Funny though as it
&gt; &gt; &gt; worked great on the breadboard but once I soldered it together
&gt; &gt; &gt; UHHHGGG.  I think I will hang onto this one  for a while.  I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; young lady in mind that is doing very promising work so I guess she
&gt; &gt; &gt; gets box # 1.
