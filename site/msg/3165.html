<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank,

I know exactly what you mean, during a session the other day I heard 
a small childs voice over the regular signal and it sounded like it 
was in the room with me. It actually gave me a chill. I going to post 
the file in the file section in the folder marked 11-22-07.

the files are both reverse files first word is forward second reversed

&gt;  Back in the days that I could play more--I used to get voices that 
were like 3-d, they would seeimly be infront of the speaker, not 
sounding like they were coming from the speakers, if that makes any 
sense. I&#x27;m trying to dulpicate, or provide the raw audio that allows 
those effects.

&gt; It will be interesting to hear responses in stereo.

&gt;  Okay. I&#x27;m mkaing one kinda based onthe Mini Box, just the linear 
mode, no sound sound chamber, no mics. I have a Walkman board I&#x27;m 
using as a radio, which has steroe outputs, so I&#x27;ll have twin 
speakers, and dual channel line output.   Frank-S

&gt; I&#x27;m supposed to be in the lot made in the second week in January. I 
watched the demo for it last night and it seems easy enough to 
understand, even for the technically braindead like me. That said, 
I&#x27;m going to have tuning issues I think, so I will be begging for 
advice. 
&gt; 
&gt; Happy Thanksgiving, Frank. Let the aliens have some turkey today, 
too!

&gt; Well at last! I just couldn&#x27;t get it together on maufacturing this 
stuff, and couldn&#x27;t get all the bugs out--yet. I&#x27;m just not a 
business person, and not even an engineer. I don&#x27;t think it was for 
me to produce that boxes, just get the concept out there. Interesting 
that a non profit outfit is making it. That&#x27;s not to say they give 
theirs away free either.   I am very pleased that someone out not 
only comprehends how the box is supposed to work, but can make it 
available. It is a relief to me!  Frank-S
