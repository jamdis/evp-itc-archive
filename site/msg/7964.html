 Not going to hide it. I just don't want anyone thinking they are in a pos=
ition to make demands. The fact is, nothing seems to work as consistently a=
s these boxes, maybe it's the combination of sweep and radio? Maybe it has =
to be analog sweep/radio? So many questions. And I still think it's a thoug=
ht form voice. 
 
 So I've been driving around to the grocery stores all ni=
ght picking out the best boxes! =3D:-0
