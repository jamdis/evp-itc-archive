<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Brian welcome to the group.

ITC stands for &quot;instrumental transcommunication&quot; which now covers a 
broad spectrum of the work being done here including EVP.

To get an idea of how the box can work you could try manual sweep 
until you get a box running. Its very easy to do.

&gt; Hello everyone
&gt; 
&gt; My name is Brian and I just joined the group to better understand 
how the box works. I know it&#x27;s a subject that has been in the 
paranormal community for some time now. They are a lot that don&#x27;t 
believe in the box and think that it&#x27;s a lot of hogwash. All I can 
say is that people thought, that the Wright Brothers where crazy to 
think they could fly,  and where are we today! So I look at the box 
as a possibility and would like to better understand how this box may 
work.
&gt; 
&gt; One of my first questions is, what does ITC stand for?
&gt; 
&gt; I know what EVP stands for (Electronic Voice Phenomenon). 
&gt; 
&gt; I am not a paranormal researcher nor do I belong to any ghost 
hunting/research group but, I do have a strong interest in it. My 
wife and I will go out at times to graveyards and/or place looking 
for paranormal activity. We did get some EVPs at once with a digital 
recorder.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; ~Brian
