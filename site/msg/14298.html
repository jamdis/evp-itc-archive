<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>One of the most fascinating ones I ever got was recorded in the ruins of a
former mental hospital. The building is shaped like an &quot;H&quot; and our group of
about 10 people was standing in one arm of the &quot;H&quot; looking through the
windows to the opposite arm. We saw a shadow moving around inside the
building in the other arm. We were just discussing this when a hoarse voice
came in THREE times on the recording and said &quot;It&#x27;s Harold Wing.&quot; This voice
was not audible to our ears at the time of the investigation.
Later on, one of the members of our group was able to access old records for
the mental hospital and found there was indeed a patient named Harold Wing
who died there of typhoid fever in 1936. There is no way any of us could&#x27;ve
known that at the time and it&#x27;s doubtful anyone living would&#x27;ve known about
it at the time, either.

&gt;  Playing acrh skeptic, what value is a voice for survival evidence if you
&gt; don&#x27;t know who it is? How do you know where it came from? Or can say beyond
&gt; doubt that it&#x27;s even &quot;paranormal&quot;? People have millions of these voices by
&gt; now.

&gt;&gt; I have been experimenting with EVP for about a year now (in my home) and i
&gt;&gt; have captured some brilliant evidence for survival.The first voice i
&gt;&gt; captured was that of a little boy saying &#x27;&#x27;hello&#x27;&#x27;at 1.30 am.It was so clear
&gt;&gt; that others could agree on and the voice could be still heard some fifteen
&gt;&gt; feet away from the recorder.I have captured other voices too, just as
&gt;&gt; impressive.Unfortunately i can&#x27;t upload because my recorder is a micro
&gt;&gt; cassette type.
