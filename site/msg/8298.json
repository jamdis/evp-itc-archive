You can download it for \nfree at www.skype.com\n\nI&#39;m keyportparanormal on there and maybe we can involve you in a \nfuture box session over skype.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Michael Edwards &lt;f1cracker75@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; What is a Skype session?\n&gt;    \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; Steve Hultay &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           Mike,\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t done that personally, because i don&#39;t think that the \n&gt; communication is at the point to receive full sentences. You get a \n&gt; couple words here and there that we can piece together to make \n&gt; somewhat of a sentence, but i don&#39;t believe anybody has reached \nthat \n&gt; stage yet. If i got a full sentence that would be great, but it \n&gt; probably wouldn&#39;t be clear enough to post on the board. If i have \nto \n&gt; explain what it says to convince people to hear it, than it&#39; s \n&gt; probably nothing. When in doubt, throw the file out. I try to form \n&gt; the questions for the most part in Yes and No format, it seems they \n&gt; can always respond with yes and no. I do get other stuff that is \n&gt; good, but i try and keep it simple for them. And frank just sits \n&gt; back and listens without asking questions allowing them to get that \n&gt; message across. I prefer to ask questions, because i know when to \n&gt; wait for a response. The Skype session i had with my Joe&#39;s box last \n&gt; friday with Juli and Joel was a great example of getting good \n&gt; communication. We were getting answers to all our questions and \n&gt; that &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; file was one of the clearest i have ever \nheard \n&gt; come through my Joe&#39;s Box #2, which is now broken again. Juli has \n&gt; all the audio and will post more as she goes through it for \neverybody \n&gt; to hear.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Michael Edwards &lt;f1cracker75@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Steve, hope all is well with you.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From this site it appears that yourself, Frank, Bruce, and \n&gt; Kristin and others I can not think of at the moment, have been \n&gt; engaged in contact as such that you ask a question and they give an \n&gt; answer. Have any of you ever taken the info you receive from lets \nsay \n&gt; one spirit and tried to contact their living relative to give them \na \n&gt; copy of the recording? Have spirits asked you more experienced \n&gt; researchers to do that, and if so, was the person you contacted \n&gt; indeed the correct loved one, and what was their response in you \n&gt; contacting them? I think this would be awesome to be able to serve \n&gt; as a messenger to the deceased\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mike Edwards Cary NC\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Steve Hultay &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I heard &quot;Help&quot; twice and than &quot;Lord&quot;.
