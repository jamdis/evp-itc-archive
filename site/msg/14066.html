<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Margaret, Misty &amp; all,
 The manual radio sweep can produce some very clear messages. A few tips I have found over the years. My best results were using a radio or stereo that had very good quality of sound reproduction, typically with a large speaker (over 6&#x27;) or even larger external speakers. The ambiance of the room also helps, try to record in a room with some space. Distance the recorder from the sound source as far as practical. Don&#x27;t overpower the recorder with loud sound, experiment with different sound levels. Keep everyone else in the house quiet during your sessions, easier said then done :). 
 
 Currently I have been experimenting with light and sweeping heterodyne sound. The method is much like a manual radio sweep except there is no radio signals. The sweep &#x27;noises&#x27; are some how transformed to words we can hear. This currenty requires a large tabletop full of test equipment to work. If I can get the voices clearer I will attempt to downsize the method to something the size of a table radio.
Here is an example I&#x27;m attaching from a test session yesterday. I was about to shut down the session. The second voice is my own.
Voice: &quot;We&#x27;re talking on the tape&quot;
Dave: &quot;Thank you for testing with us good-bye&quot; 

They always refer to the recording process as &quot;tape&quot;, even though we have moved on in technology.
Thanks for listening,
Retro-Dave

Indeed, it was at Dave&#x27;s suggestion to try this method that I became of fan of manual radio sweep (though I think it had been around for ages prior to that, I&#x27;d never heard of it.) I find Dave&#x27;s experiments to be endlessly fascinating.  Surely seems he got a double-dose, or more, of innate smartness and creativity.  ;-)

&gt; Yep ever since Frank Sumption and Retro Dave mentioned trying it and I did, I find it fascinating and very useful as a tool. I waited a long time for them to &quot;work together&quot; as spirit said they would and that conversation is here in the archives. Works great and allows for adjustments easily.
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks again to those guys for chit chatting here that day! I agree everyone should try it! No box needed for sweep tuning method.

&gt; I hope you&#x27;ll give manual sweep a try. As I&#x27;ve mentioned in other posts, I have a number of the automated sweep devices, and the manual sweep results can give any of them a run for their money. You can try just about any radio that has a tight enough dial to rapidly move back and forth across the band. 
&gt; 
&gt; There is also one known unit out there (probably more yet undiscovered) that all you have to do is hold down the tuner button (and keep holding) and it sweeps automatically without being hacked. See if you can pick up a Sony #SRF-M37V. I know other researchers who&#x27;ve gotten good results with that. Just add batteries and you&#x27;re good to go. Oh, and an external speaker too.

&gt; &gt; If someone out there could/would make me a radio or box that doesn&#x27;t tick, 
&gt; &gt; and has a fast speed, I would pay them up front for it and the work they 
&gt; &gt; do, I am not sure with ebay, because I want to know that I am getting the 
&gt; &gt; right kind. Thank you, SF
&gt; &gt; p.s. let me know, I will be more than glad to pay for it up front with a 
&gt; &gt; good electronic&#x27;s person.
