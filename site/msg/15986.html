There is no doubt in my mind about that. You are right April =3D) In the be=
ginning I did seek some proof for my own sanity. But time and time again I =
have learned much more than I ever expected to. For me its=A0become more th=
an about contact with my dead loved ones, its more about learning and growi=

I would definitely ca=

you, it was some fact that you had not known prior.

IMO, in this case t=

 It talks about using the box to find missing persons (which I didn't know =
was possible), and the conversation mentions hearing specific voice inflect=
