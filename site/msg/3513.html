<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank &amp; All, Hmm?! Does seem like Chris has &quot;highJacked&quot; Frank&#x27;s Box(es) - for his own benifits and is now afraid of what many other researchers/experimenters are doing with Boxes they have (be it Frank&#x27;s Box, Joe&#x27;s Box, the Mini-Box . . or RS 12-469, 12-470)  . . . HE does NOT want competition - imagine, IF someone else were to &quot;take his spot&quot; on C2C to talk about their results with a box or better yet, do the same research he&#x27;s conducting - but at a lower price, so more people can be exposed to the box to see/hear how it works!!!  He&#x27;d be afraid, very, very afraid, then!!! Funny, how he claims the other&#x27;s are &quot;replicas&quot; or fakes and even &quot;dangerous&quot; . . . like He&#x27;s the ONLY one who can work a box correctly!!!  Blaaaa.    =Judy=    . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

&gt;  Well, hopefully the blogs are considered public. Similar forwardings in the past have resulted in slander threats. These threats themsleves are in fact illegal, but it&#x27;s still disturbing to get such threats. 
&gt;  
&gt;  The way I see it, this guy is making public claims and assertions about equimpment I make, and he admits he is only testing (primary tester), that I do not completely agree wiht. I believe I have an obligation to tell my side, and to state once again, as maker of Moon&#x27;s &quot;Telephone to the dead&quot;  equipment, which is in fact is one of my boxes, that I say, all are allowed to use it for whatever they want. Moon in fact has no authority whatsoever as a box tester to restrict it&#x27;s use to anyone, nor to claim that his contacts are anymore legitimate than anyone else&#x27;s. Moon himself announced to the world, twice on Coast to Coast AM,  that I in fact made the boxes, and as the acknowledged creator/maker/inventor of Frank&#x27;s box, I say all can use the damn things freely. In additon, I opened it up to all experimentors in an attempt to verify my results, which is in fact an application of scientific method, known as peer review.
&gt;  
&gt;  Moon&#x27;s contacts through the box may in fact be real, I don&#x27;t know, personaly, he seems like a good guy, and I find these disaggreements troubling, but everyone has their own way using any technology. If you had a cell phone that calls Mars, that would not mean all cell phones can only be used for such contacts, it&#x27;s that same with boxes. There may be many levels of spirit, and who is to say which is acceptable, and which is not? I am unwilling to accept any one person&#x27;s results as the only results possible.
