Mr Sumption, I desire very much to obtain a "box". What would it take to get one??? I am a serious researcher with over 40 yrs. of investigation under my belt. After reading and reviewing everything I could find concerning your device, I, personally, have the greatest confidence in making milestone leaps of progress with it. I would be very pleased to hear back from you soonest. Thank you in advance.    --Roderick Pyatt, Ph.D (Paranormal Psychology)

I apologize. I wouldn't ask for boxes back, firstly all the boxes out there 
are proto types to test various configurations, and if I kept them, they 
would just sit on a shelf until I felt like doing upgrades, like on 12 and 
13. Second, I try not to give with strings.
