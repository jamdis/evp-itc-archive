The scoop: =
Conspiracy theorists are convinced a rogue planet will destroy the Earth in=
 2012, and just as we are about to see the release of a Hollywood movie on =
the topic, the hype is set to increase. David Morrison, a NASA astrobiologi=
st and expert scientist for NASA's Ask an Astrobiologist website, calls for=
 a reality check and in 2008 he contributed this article to Discovery News.=

Unbeknownst to most of us, a small but vocal group of conspiracy theorists=
 is convinced that a rogue planet is about to enter the inner solar system =
and doom the Earth.
They say that this threatening planet on a 3600-year or=
bit was discovered by the ancient Mesopotamians, who named it Nibiru, and i=
t was known also to the Mayans, who associated it with the end of their cal=
endar "long count" in December 2012. In Web sites, blogs, and radio talk sh=
ows, they insist that NASA is tracking Nibiru -- but that this information =
is being kept from the public as part of a worldwide conspiracy.
They say t=
he official silence can't be maintained for much longer, however, because b=
y 2009 Nibiru will be visible to the naked eye from the southern hemisphere=
. They also say Earth's axis is already tilting and the length of the day i=
s changing under its influence. As one believer recently wrote to me, "Why =
are you lying. It's coming, and everyone knows it."
I began to receive ques=
tions about this bizarre story in December 2007 through NASA's "Ask an Astr=
obiologist" site. Normally I receive up to a dozen questions per week from =
the public, dealing mostly with life in the universe -- but in the past 6 m=
onths the Nibiru traffic alone has grown to 20-25 messages a week, ranging =
from the anguished "I can't sleep," "I am really scared" or "I don't want t=
o die" to the abusive "you are putting my family at risk" and "if NASA deni=
es it then it must be true."
As a scientist, I'm both fascinated and astoni=
shed by the deluge of questions from people who are genuinely frightened an=
d, apparently, unable to distinguish astronomical fact from fiction. They'r=
e watching YouTube videos and visiting slick Web sites with nothing in thei=
r skeptical toolkit, or to quote Carl Sagan no "baloney detector." Now a bl=
ockbuster disaster film called "2012" is set for release in the summer of 2=
009, and the commercial enterprise is clearly trying to cash in on people's=
 concern (perhaps contributing to their fear as well).
My guess is that onl=
y a tiny fraction of people truly believes that Armageddon is coming in Dec=
ember 2012. But their uncritical acceptance of this story worries me as a w=
arning of the dangers of our current scientific illiteracy.
We're facing mo=
numental problems with global warming and loss of habitat, yet a substantia=
l minority of Americans thinks the world was formed less than 10,000 years =
ago and deny that evolution is possible. Many Americans seem to prefer coal=
-fired generators to nuclear power plants without realizing the toll in pub=
lic health that coal imposes. Billions are spent, including tax-payer dolla=
rs, for so-called alternative medicine with no scientific evidence for its =
efficacy. And legislators often resist efforts to collect the data that cou=
ld actually demonstrate which government programs are effective and which o=
nes don't work as intended.
In spite of my frustrations, I can always hope =
that Nibiru will turn into a teaching moment. Its proponents are convinced =
that it will be visible to the unaided eye this coming spring, and its effe=
cts on the rotation and orbit of the Earth will be obvious by summer (just =
in time for the release of the film "2012"). When none of this happens, I h=
ope they'll realize that they need better tools to distinguish fact from fi=
ction.
