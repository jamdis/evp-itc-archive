<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for listening and for the feedback, Stefan &amp; Rees.  

Stefan, just a quick clarification ... I have removed the &#x27;junk&#x27; between my voice and the 
answer.  If I&#x27;m going to get an answer, it&#x27;s usually between .5-7 or so seconds, and I 
usually note that in my description as I don&#x27;t want to mislead people about the timing of 
the response.  Still, I guess that can be considered a fairly immediate answer.  :0)

Many times the program has run for about a minute without creating any clear phrases (I 
keep each session under 2 minutes), relevant or otherwise.  I really like this fact, because 
in my opinion, it greatly reduces the chances of a false positive.  

Thank you so much for sharing your creativity and giving us researchers additional tools 
to experiment with!  This has been really fun and I plan to keep exploring the potential of 
your software and the allophones file.

&gt; Hi Margret,
&gt; 
&gt; wow, except for the part &quot;Hi Margret&quot; (which sounds for me phonetically
&gt; like &quot;I horst it&quot; which of course makes no sense), I was able to hear
&gt; everything perfectly. I&#x27;m impressed by these clear and immediate
&gt; answers. I didn&#x27;t expect that this simple method would work so well for
&gt; some experimenters.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Just a quick note to let y&#x27;all know I&#x27;ve replaced the files in my EVP Maker folder with 
four new 
&gt; &gt; ones from tonight.  I&#x27;m very impressed with the responses/answers I am being given. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I received a greeting, by name.  
&gt; &gt; Confirmation when I asked if I&#x27;d heard correctly.
&gt; &gt; An object on my desk was correctly identified.
&gt; &gt; An object in my left hand was correctly identified (with a unique interpretation of it!)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I hope you can hear some of these.  I&#x27;ve been working to gather examples which show 
&gt; &gt; relevance and intent of communication.  Arthur is on a roll.  LOL.  ;0)
