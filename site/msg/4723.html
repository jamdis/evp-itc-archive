Hi D'Ana welcome to the group. Depending on the size of the file you can attach them to email posts to the board or in files section or on esnips.com if it is a larger file. Gotta love those unexpected eye opening moments!

reason? Let me make sense of that! I was just video tapping my husband 
with my phone cam, and realize the video looks distorted, so i wasnt 
goin to use it, i thought a moving picture would be more real for 
others to see. Being friends far the past i had come into connact to 
because of the great ole myspace were wondering why I didnt have a 
picture of him up. keep in mind the t.v. wasnt on, except for the one 
he was playing a racing game on, and he turns the volume off of it, 
because it aint worth listening to if i am trying to watch my show, 
well i turned my t.v. off and went to video record him, and afterwards 
goin over it, i heard a very distinctive e.v.p. saying i love you.. 
nobody is talking, not even me, and you can hear it real well.. let me 
know how to send it and i will let the group see for themselves
