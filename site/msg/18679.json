I don&#39;t know of anyone that uses this stuff, be\n&gt;&gt; it hack boxes, or any other method to try to actually get higher level\n&gt;&gt; contacts. No one just allows the entities to speak, all want to second guess\n&gt;&gt; something that has more access and is in a higher state of being. Everyone\n&gt;&gt; wants to be TAPS, and get the crap scared out themselves. Most hear only\n&gt;&gt; what they want to hear.

Many of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the modern digital radios have a function that mutes, or quiets the radio\n&gt;&gt;&gt; while tuning between stations. I&#39;m not sure why, but unmutting the radio\n&gt;&gt;&gt; allows the audio to be heard while the radio searches for the next\n&gt;&gt;&gt; station--and--the radio is disallowed form locking onto a station, so it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; keeps sweeping all the way to the end of the band--AM or FM, then starts\n&gt;&gt;&gt; over. This creates the raw audio and &quot;they&quot; speak. The sweep can even be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; done by hand, tuning a radio slowing by hand. I sue cheap radios I get at\n&gt;&gt;&gt; thrift stores for this, gluing a dowel to the tuning knob to make it easier.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Then record form the speaker--open air.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  So as long as the radio sweeps at not to fast and not too slow, it&#39;ll\n&gt;&gt;&gt; works. Some are better than others.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  It takes some practice, and maybe even a certain allowing to hear the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ghost voices.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  I prefer to take a tuner out of a radio, such as a clock radio and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; supply an external sweep voltage. The sweep circuits are just basic op amps,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and you can buy a function generator kit to supply a triangle wave for\n&gt;&gt;&gt; linear sweep. See keyportparanormal.com for more info on using this kit,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and building boxes.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  One problem with this stuff is that it can be extremely subjective,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; others may not hear what you hear, or hear it the same. I think mostly the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; messages are meant for the one that receives it. We go round and round with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the skeptics and debunkers.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  F-S\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Sun, Aug 29, 2010 at 11:08 PM, usmcmacswife &lt;usmcmacswife@yahoo.com&lt;http://mc/compose?to=usmcmacswife@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, we&#39;re new here hello!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; We just had a couple questions.
