My SPIRIT_RADIO account is fubar right now so I logged in with this alias. Any investigations coming up? Halloweens right around the corner. \n\nNot much investigating going on, work and school keeping me extremely busy. Due to this fact, I put some of my equipment on ebay. Sold the EM Pump already. The PX is up on the auction block right now. Can&#39;t say it priced at a bargain though. The last one posted sold for over $400.00 so I feel mine is priced at what the market will bear.\n\nPhone apps are what I use when I&#39;m in an appropriate location. Wish Bill Chappell would write some for the Android market. I do have his stuff on my Itouch though. \n\nThought I would stop by. Going to play with the Ouji board now (JK!). I&#39;ll check back in a bit.\n\nTake Care,\n\nMark"}
