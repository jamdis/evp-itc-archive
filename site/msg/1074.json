This has AM and \nFM, and stereo outputs, which might be interesting in an echo box. I started \nat about 1p yesterday, and finished at 4a this morning, then worked on it a \ncouple more hours after a five hour nap. It&#39;s just wired, still needs \ntested. The car tuners still work better than the home made tuners.\n\nFrank\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nNeed a break?
