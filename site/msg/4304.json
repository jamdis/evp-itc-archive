Interesting it was at the -75% because most of \nthe h2o voices reside in the -74% region. Theres a few that are in \nnormal time/speed but since I record for short amount of time using \nthat method (30 seconds or so) most things are said very quickly and \ncant be heard until you slow it down to the magic number -74% speed.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;       This was in a peice I made with tones only, no speaking in \nthe original.
