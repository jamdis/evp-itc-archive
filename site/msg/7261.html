No, it was from a private investigation at Rico D's in Chicago.  It's a famous Speak Easy where Frank Capone use to hang out.  I have the raw audio, just never really went thru all of it, but you could hear several spirits identify themselves as the Capone Brothers.  One of Frank's ladies whom he cared for dearly gave him a son who died on the property, and Isbelle (Frank's lady) I believe took her own life.  It is said to believe that many things took place there, in fact there is still bullet holes in the walls.  It made for an interesting night and secrets that seemed to come through from the otherside.  
   
  I always say, the dead do tell tales!  Or at least the BOX does, LOL!

  Ann, given I am from Chicago, I thought I would do it the Capone way.  "You never bring a knife to a gun fight"  LOL.
   
  I actually have audio from Frank's Box from a alledged haunted Speak Easy where Al and Frank Capone decided to come through the box.  It was very interesting whether or not it was really them, nevertheless I think they would be willing to help pay credit where credit was do.!
