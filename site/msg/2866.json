Is there anyway to hook a mic up to it, or is that what you mean about not being able to put an audio input?  I&#39;ll try hooking my speakers up instead of using my headset and see if I can hear it louder.\n  keep posting them!  That is fascinating, I have never seen the boxes before!\n\nFrank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n          \n That&#39;s as loud as I can get it without feedback.

Frank is there anyway you can turn up the volume of the box?  Maybe it&#39;s my headphones but it doesn&#39;t seem very loud on the videos?  I love it, thanks so much for sharing :)\n\nFrank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:       Hi all;\n \n Okay, finally got a video converter to work, so up loaded longer videos to you tube.
