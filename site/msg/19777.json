The voltage from the radio from one end of the band to the other is roughly 2v-9v, so the goal is to make a sweep circuit to match what the radio puts out.\n\nYou can see in this video, that i got the radio to sweep between 2v-7v.  That means it&#39;s covering more than 3/4 of the bandwidth, which is excellent.\n\nI have been testing different versions of this circuit, but couldn&#39;t get it to come close until today.\n\nThis stuff is NOT easy to build, especially how frank does it.  I&#39;m focusing mainly on the circuit, but frank build everything from scratch with the exception of maybe the tuner.\n\nI think you will find the video interesting.  The yellow box is my multimeter, it shows me what the circuit is doing.  You can do the same thing with a scope.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Alhi_hze5L8\n\n\nS-H"}
