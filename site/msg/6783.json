And I love your screen  name.  You \nare right when you say you can never force or coerce a spirit to  communicate \nwith.  For those that are able to communicate with them we do  feel extremely \npriviledged and honored that they have chosen to do so.   Even when there is no \ncommunication just listening and hearing what they have to  say is very \namazing in itself.  What they say may not always be nice but  maybe they know more \nabout us than we give them credit for?\n \nJeff\n \n \nIn a message dated 2/3/2008 11:52:08 P.M.

Never \nbefore  have I made a board in 24 hours, it required only a slight shift in the  \nconcept.  \n\nFrank-S\n\n \n____________________________________\nClimb to the top of the charts!
