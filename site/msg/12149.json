The common mistake is that everyone  turns \nit on and expects to get immediate results.  Well all that comes out  is random \nnames and what some people may term &quot;garbage&quot; at that time.  You  have to let \nthe spirits around you learn how to communicate thru the box  and this can \ntake a good 30 to 60 minutes.  At that time all the randomness  will have died \ndown and you can now start to communicate thru the Ovilus  1.  If this step is \noverlooked then you just sit there staring at this unit  thinking you just \npissed away $200.00.  And that is not the case.  It  takes time for the spirits \nto learn how to communicate regardless of what device  is used.  Now if you use \nthis device in the same location over and over  again you only have to do it \nonce.  When I first got mine it was spewing  out all kind of random garbage \nthat made sense.  But once I did this the  communication flowed fluently.  It \neven gave me the name of the little girl  who&#39;s spirit inhabits our house and \nwhen I called her name after hearing it this  little girl came and stood in the \nhallway looking at me in amazement.  The  best was when my cat jumped up by me \nand the Ovilus 1 and wanted attention the  Ovilus 1 said &quot;good cat&quot;.  Then \nwhen my dog ran into the room and wanted my  attention over the cat the unit \nsaid &quot;bad dog&quot;, LOL.  So it does work and  ask around to people who have them \nabout their experiences.\n \nJeff\n \n \nIn a message dated 9/16/2008 11:01:21 A.M.
