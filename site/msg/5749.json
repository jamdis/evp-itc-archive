This was captured on a digital voice recorder \n&gt; while \n&gt; &gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was heating coffee in the microwave oven nearby, and I felt \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; microwave must have been a powerful energy source for \n&gt; &gt; the &quot;speaker.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It may be important to note that I had just invited spirits \n&gt; &gt; inside \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the house from outside, and that after I listened to this \n&gt; message \n&gt; &gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; told them to go back outside because they were too rude to \n&gt; &gt; continue \n&gt; &gt; &gt; talking to.

Robin, \nI \n&gt; am \n&gt; &gt; &gt; glad to hear that the protection ritual will be utilized by \nyou \n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the purpose it was intended. To give any individual that \nwants \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; anopportunity to use it. You will find many forms of \n&gt; interaction \n&gt; &gt; on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this group, running the gamut from total agreement to calm \n&gt; &gt; &gt; debate /discussion. To full blown arguments. That is what \nmakes \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; group, If everyone followed one single ideology and the ideas \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; any \n&gt; &gt; &gt; single person without questionit would not be a group it \nwould \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; cult. Welcome to the wonderful world of box research robin, \nI&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; sure \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you will be a valued member and researcher in this community. \n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@: MudPuddleFarm@: Thu, 17 Jan 2008 22:38:57 -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 0800Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debate--\nBruce\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m still giving this topic a lot of thought because I \n&gt; &gt; absolutely \n&gt; &gt; &gt; believe in the power of prayer, the power of positivity, and \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; power of ritual. When I first started recording EVP a couple \nof \n&gt; &gt; &gt; years ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when \nit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; happened to me I felt elated rather than frightened or \n&gt; &gt; distressed. I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will ask again: What physical or psychic harm is a \ndisembodied \n&gt; &gt; &gt; entity capable of doing? Please listen to the one EVP I&#39;ve \n&gt; posted \n&gt; &gt; on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this board and tell me what, if anything, you hear. I know \nwhat \n&gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hear, and I consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; response that has created the determination in me to continue \n&gt; &gt; &gt; researching the unknown. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings. I only want to learn \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; much as I can from you and the other dedicated researchers on \n&gt; &gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; board. It never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; past, and that&#39;s about all I can say. I will probably use one \n&gt; &gt; from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract \n&gt; &gt; &gt; goodness. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, thank you for this contribution. I think the debate has \n&gt; &gt; been \n&gt; &gt; &gt; an excellent one, and I&#39;ve appreciated the opportunity to be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; enlightened.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: bhali333 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:EVP-ITC%\n40yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 16, 2008 8:06 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I swore I would not get wraped up in this debateBUT!The \n&gt; reason \n&gt; &gt; I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; came up with this whole protection ritual was that some of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; new \n&gt; &gt; &gt; researchers whereexpressing a rational concern for negative \n&gt; &gt; responces \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that they were recieving through thier boxes.The short \n&gt; protection \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ritual that I posted is not meant to quell irrational \n&gt; histerical \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fear, and I agreewith rosemary that anyone suffering from \nsuch \n&gt; &gt; fear \n&gt; &gt; &gt; should rethink thier involment in the paranormal research \n&gt; &gt; field.that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; being said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal \ncomfort \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; those new individuals that had never expperienced spiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; negativity. And to help ease them into aproaching a session \n&gt; &gt; &gt; eventually with confidenceand determination as well as full \n&gt; &gt; &gt; curiousity for all types of the communication we recieve.My \n&gt; &gt; initial \n&gt; &gt; &gt; post of the ritual file was done with the best of intentions \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; meant to be another tool available for those who felt they \n&gt; needed \n&gt; &gt; or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer ritual, I \n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; &gt; think it is really worthy of all this debate.Use it, don&#39;t \nuse \n&gt; &gt; it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s there if you want it. Also I must say there are two \nkinds \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fear the kind that is natural and a god given emotion for \nself \n&gt; &gt; &gt; preservation, ie the fright and flight reflex that is an \n&gt; &gt; instinctive \n&gt; &gt; &gt; trait in all of us. Then you have the irrational dibilitating \n&gt; &gt; phobic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fear that can turn an individual into a frozen statue. That \n&gt; type \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fear I believe is unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; learned how to harness. I also believe that anyone that \nharbors \n&gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; type of fear would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and \nin \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; case of such fear it would already be present and doing a \nsmall \n&gt; &gt; &gt; protection ritual would not fuel it any further.

This was captured on a digital voice recorder &lt;BR&gt;&gt; while &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; was heating coffee in the microwave oven nearby, and I felt &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; microwave must have been a powerful energy source for\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the &quot;speaker.&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It may be important to note that I had just invited spirits &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; inside &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the house from outside, and that after I listened to this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; message &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; told them to go back outside because they were too rude to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; continue &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; talking to. I&#39;ve tried to replicate this experiment a number &lt;BR&gt;of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; times since then (without the verbal invitation into my home) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; have had no luck whatsoever. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gleefully moving on to box research!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robin&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: bruce halliday &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;A\n href=&quot;mailto:evp-itc%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;evp-itc@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;mailto:evp-&lt;WBR&gt;itc%&lt;BR&gt;40yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, January 18, 2008 5:18 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debate--Bruce&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robin, In the evp file you posted I believe I&#39;m hearing &quot;we &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; want to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; kill you&quot;please let me know if that is what you hear. Robin, &lt;BR&gt;I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; am &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; glad to hear that the protection ritual will be utilized by &lt;BR&gt;you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the purpose it was intended. To give any individual that &lt;BR&gt;wants &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; anopportunity to use it. You will find many forms of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; interaction &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; this group, running the gamut from total agreement to calm &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; debate /discussion. To full blown arguments. That is\n what &lt;BR&gt;makes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; group, If everyone followed one single ideology and the ideas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; any &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; single person without questionit would not be a group it &lt;BR&gt;would &lt;BR&gt;&gt; be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; cult. Welcome to the wonderful world of box research robin, &lt;BR&gt;I&#39;m &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sure &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; you will be a valued member and researcher in this community. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bruce&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@: MudPuddleFarm@&lt;WBR&gt;: Thu, 17 Jan 2008 22:38:57 -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 0800Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debate--&lt;BR&gt;Bruce&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m still giving this topic a lot of thought because I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; absolutely &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; believe in the power of prayer, the power of\n positivity, and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; power of ritual. When I first started recording EVP a couple &lt;BR&gt;of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; years ago I was warned to expect negative responses, so when &lt;BR&gt;it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; happened to me I felt elated rather than frightened or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; distressed. I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; will ask again: What physical or psychic harm is a &lt;BR&gt;disembodied &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; entity capable of doing? Please listen to the one EVP I&#39;ve &lt;BR&gt;&gt; posted &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; this board and tell me what, if anything, you hear. I know &lt;BR&gt;what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; hear, and I consider it distinctly threatening; yet, this is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; response that has created the determination in me to continue &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; researching the unknown. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce, I am in awe of your recordings. I only want to learn &lt;BR&gt;&gt; as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; much as I can from you and the\n other dedicated researchers on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; board. It never occurred to me to use a protection ritual in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; past, and that&#39;s about all I can say. I will probably use one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; this point on, maybe not so much to repel evil as to attract &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; goodness. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, thank you for this contribution. I think the debate has &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; been &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; an excellent one, and I&#39;ve appreciated the opportunity to be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; enlightened.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robin&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: bhali333 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;mailto:EVP-&lt;WBR&gt;ITC%&lt;BR&gt;40yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n &gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 16, 2008 8:06 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] this damned protection debate&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I swore I would not get wraped up in this debateBUT!The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; reason &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; came up with this whole protection ritual was that some of &lt;BR&gt;the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; new &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; researchers whereexpressing a rational concern for negative &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; responces &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that they were recieving through thier boxes.The short &lt;BR&gt;&gt; protection &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ritual that I posted is not meant to quell irrational &lt;BR&gt;&gt; histerical &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fear, and I agreewith rosemary that anyone suffering from &lt;BR&gt;such &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; fear &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; should rethink thier involment in the paranormal research &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; field.that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; being said, It was only meant as a source of subliminal &lt;BR&gt;comfort &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; those new individuals that had never expperienced spiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; negativity. And to help ease them into aproaching a session &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; eventually with confidenceand determination as well as full &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; curiousity for all types of the communication we recieve.My &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; initial &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; post of the ritual file was done with the best of intentions &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; meant to be another tool available for those who felt they &lt;BR&gt;&gt; needed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer ritual, I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; don&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; think it is really worthy of all this debate.Use it, don&#39;t &lt;BR&gt;use &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s there if you want it. Also I must say there are two &lt;BR&gt;kinds &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fear the kind that is natural and a god given emotion for &lt;BR&gt;self &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; preservation, ie the fright and\n flight reflex that is an &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; instinctive &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; trait in all of us. Then you have the irrational dibilitating &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; phobic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fear that can turn an individual into a frozen statue. That &lt;BR&gt;&gt; type &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fear I believe is unhealthyand should be addressed and dealt &lt;BR&gt;&gt; with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; learned how to harness. I also believe that anyone that &lt;BR&gt;harbors &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; type of fear would not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and &lt;BR&gt;in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; case of such fear it would already be present and doing a &lt;BR&gt;small &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; protection ritual would not fuel it any further. So lets take &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; what it is, something to utilize in our box of tools like an &lt;BR&gt;&gt; emf &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; meter.you may have an old rusty odd sized wrench at the &lt;BR&gt;bottom &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n your tool box at home that you inherited from your &lt;BR&gt;grandfather &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; have never usedbut if you come across that odd nut that needs &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; tightening somedsy you will be glad you have it.Bruce&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Need to know the score, the latest news, or you need your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Hotmail�-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; get your &quot;fix&quot; Check it out. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ____________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_________&lt;WBR&gt;_&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Climb to the top of the charts!
