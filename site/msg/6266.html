I must have joined this group way too late to understand what was going on,=
 but was this person really deserving of being banned?  I didn't agree with=
 her recent opinions, but didn't she have the right to express them?

  Thank you kindly for giving me the opportunity to leave one more
  =
comment before "banning" me. 
  I have given some serious thought to this g=
roup over the last few
  days. Contrary to popular opinion, I have never be=
en attacking. I have
  not name called, used profanity, etc. I have brought=
 another opinion,
  another thought, another suggestion. 
  This group is c=
alled a "discussion" group. Discussions usually involve
  more than one opi=
nion. I did not know that I had joined a group of
  "gurus" as you are so q=
uick to call others mockingly. You do not want
  any one's opinion if it is=
 different than your own. That's fine, truly. 
  You don't have to ban me. =
I won't come back again.
