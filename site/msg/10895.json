I have\n&gt; listed box 6 on ebay.  I will use ALL the money from the sale to buy\n&gt; Speakjet Chips.  They cost $30.00 each!  I have all the parts for 10\n&gt; more boxes and just need the chips.  I was going to put one a month\n&gt; out but I really want to get them out faster than that.  So if all\n&gt; goes well I will send out many boxes in the next couple weeks.  The\n&gt; listing is under Speakjet Box EVP Ghost box Paranormal.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks Rob.\n&gt;"}
