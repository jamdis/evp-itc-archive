&gt;  Hello everyone, 
&gt; 
&gt;     My name is Tommy Golden and I am the founder of The Middle 
&gt; Tennessee Ghost Chasers in Tennessee. I have researched EVP since 
1999, 
&gt; and saw a youtube video from Mike Coletta and it really raised my 
&gt; attention level. I watch the videos, went to radio shack, bought 
the 
&gt; equipment, and modified the 12-469. I recorded my first 
communication 
&gt; and I have to tell you that is has sparked a flame that has been 
out 
&gt; for many years now. I have read almost every article about Frank&#x27;s 
box 
&gt; and seen it in action at Waverly Hills with Chris Moon. Anywho I 
would 
&gt; like to thank you guys for giving me a new investigation tool that 
&gt; gives realtime answers. Thanks also great job Mike with those vids 
and 
&gt; step by step direction on your site.
