<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I just wanted to thank everyone from the EVP-ITC Group for allowing me to embark upon a wondrous journey of experimentation and investigation over the last few years. As some may remember, I chose to use ghost box communication specifically for the purpose of working with ghosts.

Over several years I conducted field experiments to figure out how we can best help ghosts move forward in their life-journey, beyond the earth plane. I have diligently taken notes and am excited to share many of the numerous stories of ghost investigation and the messages I received. Over a period of time, we became quite good at assisting lost spirit to cross over to the light, effectively solving cases of haunting.

Recently, I published my new book entitled &quot;Helping Ghosts.&quot; In the book, I acknowledged Frank Sumption, Steve Hultay, and Bruce Halliday for the help they have afforded me along the way. Frank was kind enough to allow me to share his story of experimentation. Of course, there were many others who shared their thoughts and experiences through this group. Thank you for that. The EVP-ITC group web address is listed in the resources section of my book for that reason.
