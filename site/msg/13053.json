Now \nthat everyone knows they are from a plane crash, that will set up the \nprejudice of hearing plane/travel related words in the evp noises.\nAnd as you probably know, once that prejudice is active, once I say\n&quot;Doesn&#39;t that sound like someone saying &quot;Sssssstewardesssss...&quot;, then\neveryone hears THAT word, rather than just noise, or, for example \n&quot;Stewed ass&quot;.\n\nAnd, if something does sound like a plane/travel related word, it \nwill now be highlighted as an example of why this was a successful \ntest, and the other less-relevant words ignored.  This is a form of \nconfirmation bias, which again, hurts the value of the test.\n\nA more objective way would have been to send out both crash related \nitems, and completely innocuous items, with no explanation of where \neach was from, and see what kind of EVPs were returned on each.  \nFurther, the returned EVPs should then be returned to someone to \nevaluate who ALSO doesn&#39;t know the origin of the objects, so that \nthey do not torture the interpretations into the forms you hope and \nexpect them to be (again, plane/travel related).  While this test of \ncourse lacks all kinds of controls, this would at least be a start to \ndefining a double-blind test, which is the gold standard for good \nresearch in this kind of research.\n\nEven though you have tried to keep some of the information quiet, \nthere is still quite a large opportunity for guessing and \ncoincidence.  For example, one person might assume this was from an \nairshow (since, as you said, the event was very fast, and many people \nsaw it), and so only send in EVPs that would be relevant to that \nsituation (I.e. Not sending in child-like sounds, or sending in \nsounds that sound like scratchy tower or inter-plane \ncommunication).    If the crash was a commercial airline, then dozens \nof different people could have been killed, which means you could \nfind SOME relevancy no matter what noises are returned to you: \npractical any word, name, or sound will support some speculation that\nit could have been relevant to one of those people. \n\nI do think it is a good idea to test your theories. But my purpose \nhere is to suggest ways to help these tests be as objective as \npossible, and for your efforts and testing to be as worth while as \npossible, and for the youtube video results you make to be as \nvaluable and bulletproof as possible.  But I am concerned that the \nabove scenario is full of opportunity for subjectivity and \nmisinterpretation."}
