(Cause you know the media is not going to give us the good news, its just doesn&#39;t sell as well as the bad news).... who knows... I have a friend who is Christian and she says that it feels like we&#39;re living in the last days of Rome... sadly, by what I see around me, I really have nothing with which I can disagree... we can only wait and see....\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@...m, SnowfireL@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; _http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3pDxJNEIBQ&feature=feedu_ \n&gt; (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3pDxJNEIBQ&feature=feedu) \n&gt;  \n&gt; _http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plrf5PVyoQ4&feature=related_ \n&gt; (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plrf5PVyoQ4&feature=related) \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; _http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNNMwpDt5R8&feature=feedu_ \n&gt; (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNNMwpDt5R8&feature=feedu) \n&gt;  \n&gt; This stuff is so weird, wonder what is happening, an Egyptian friend of  \n&gt; mine the only Christian Coptic Church was destroyed by Muslims.   sf\n&gt;"}
