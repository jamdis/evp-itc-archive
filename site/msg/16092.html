I'm not offended by Coast to Coast.=A0 Skepticism or unbelive is part of th=
e package you accept when you are involved in the paranormal.=A0 Coast to C=
oast has helped open people's eyes to the paranormal.

As I slip into tempo=
rary insanity....One of my projects is trying to find intelligent life here=
 in Las Vegas.=A0 For some reason I don't get any voices from the living--t=
he dead are no problem.=A0 I'm sure the skeptics say "Oh no, there's no int=
elligent life here in Nevada."=A0 I say, "There's no living intelligent lif=
e here."=A0=A0Nevada's last in education and we're trying hard to become nu=
mber one in teenage pregnancy!=A0 We won't stop till all the records fall!=
=A0 Anyway, some of the EVPs I capture here are about gambling, smoking and=
 drinking.=A0 Sounds about right for Vegas doesn't it?=A0 I was thinking ab=
out asking some of the spirits out for a night of gambling.=A0 I bet it wou=
ld be a nice advantage and some of these guys probably have a mean poker ga=
me anyway.

I'll end on this insanity.=A0 Mississippi is leading the nation=
 in obesity as Nevada jealously watches.=A0 Nevada parents have ordered the=
ir children to not stop eating so Nevada can top Mississippi.=A0 I'll keep =
you informed on the progress.=A0 Watch out Mississippi, here we come!=A0 In=
 the meantime, I'm=A0leave now and do=A0my part by eating three whopper com=
bos and a shake--at McDonalds.=A0 If intelligent life is found here, unfort=
unately it won't be me.

On a serious note, I've noticed that as the moon i=
s full my voices come in clearer and clearer.=A0 Several weeks ago I was ge=
tting absolutely nothing then as the moon is becoming full it's really pick=
ed up.=A0 The moon should be full in the next day or two so I really expect=
 good comms.

We have the Gold Hill Hotel here in Nevada.=A0 It's one of th=
e most haunted places in the world.=A0 It would be cool if I could set up a=
 trip to go ghost hunting there, but that would be like a little leaguer st=
epping up to the major leagues.=A0 Even seasoned mediums have left that pla=
ce in fear never to return.=A0 Maybe I should call the tour, "Night of the =
Unholy Living Hell."=A0 Would that sale, or frighten off people?

cheers

I think C2C is one of the =
few media places where EVP, Spiritualism, Mediumship, Ghost-hunting, and th=
ings of that nature get a fair hearing. I think George Noory does a great j=
