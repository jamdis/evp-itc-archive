Thank you Mike.  It's possible the repair company wasn't forthright in thei=
r explanation to me, but they claimed to have cleaned it over a period of s=
everal days hoping to get it to work.  I guess at this point I'm wondering =
if the phone can be transformed into a ghost box (just kidding).  I don't q=
uite understand why it can't be repaired anyway--Is it that expensive to ju=
st replace the guts of the thing?  You're right that the problem is that it=
 turns on and then shorts out or drains the battery after a short time.  

=
Anyway, I've been studying your videos and radio hack pictures and have to =
say thanks again!  I think I might actually be able to follow the instructi=
ons for a couple of things you describe.  I've been learning a lot from you=
 already and have only been here a few days!

one


  Hi Robin,

  I'm sorry this is happening to you. Whether the seller=
 knew it had a 
  problem or not is one for the guessing game. If the selle=
r used the 
  phone on a regular basis, more than just turning it on, I'm s=
ure 
  he/she knew of the short charge time... but if they just deal on eba=
y 
  in used phones they may have just done a quick funtional test and 
  t=
hen turned the phone off, not knowing the problem existed, then 
  putting =
it on ebay.

  Anyway... to the problem itself. I'm assuming from your post=
 that 
  the phone does work, but will just not work for very long, drainin=
g 
  the battery within a very short period of time.
  If this is the case,=
 (IMHO) I have to wonder where they get 
  the "water damage" explanation f=
rom..?? Now, water can damage a 
  piece of electronics equipment if the eq=
uipment is on when the water 
  makes contact. The water could act like a c=
onductor and make 
  connections internally where connections would not nor=
mally be made, 
  causing components to go bad because of excess current, v=
oltage, etc.
  But, if a unit is off, water may or may not do damage depend=
ing if 
  there is something that can be damaged just by getting wet (like =

  speakers, etc.)
  But, since your unit appears to work, just draining th=
e battery to 
  quickly... I have a very hard time understanding the "water=
 damage" 
  thing they told you.

  Since a new battery is doing the same t=
hing as the old, that phone is 
  draining the battery because something, w=
hich uses a lot of current, 
  appears to be on all the time, or something =
is being shorted (or 
  turned on) causing current drain (even if the phone=
 appears to be 
  off), while still allowing the phone to function while on=
.

  What that exact problem is can not be guessed from afar though.

  Sor=
ry I couldn't be more specific. I hope this helps a bit.

  - Mike
