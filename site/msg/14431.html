Yeah Adobe Audition is definitely the best for the job.

I just meant that =
even the best out there isn't perfect, meaning no matter what, you cannot c=
lean up a clip without affecting the parts you want to keep as well. So the=
 more you clean up, the more distorted the good parts get.

I just don't th=
ink it is possible for any software to isolate specific parts apart from th=
e background. Generally, Adobe is better at it, because it has the comparis=
on tool where you can select certain things you want to reduce. But even so=
, the parts you don't want reduced will still be affected.
