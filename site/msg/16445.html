<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, exactly. There are many people who lie and many people who don&#x27;t. If a
person was a certain way with a living body, I wouldn&#x27;t expect any different
behavior from them now that they are devoid of body.

&gt; Most likely because, as others have stated, these spirits are still the

&gt; Thanks.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; So the question is: Why do the entities lie? Just to keep the
&gt; conversation going? Or maybe they aren&#x27;t lying at all? Maybe they are in a
&gt; dreamlike state where things aren&#x27;t necessary based in reality? Or -- even
&gt; weirder -- maybe they are in an alternate universe altogether?
&gt;
&gt;

Yes, exac ly. The e a e many people who lie and many people who don&#x27; . I a pe son was a ce ain way wi h a li ing body, I wouldn&#x27; expec any di e en beha io om hem now ha hey a e de oid o body.
