There was some sort of disconnect and my \n&gt; name didn&#39;t show up on the guest list, so they couldn&#39;t give me a \n&gt; room there. That&#39;s what the hotel supervisor said last night \n&gt; anyway... and it&#39;s too late in the game to follow this up.\n&gt; He did say about 245 people will be in attendance, so you should have \n&gt; a good time.\n&gt; Frank Sumption and I were both on their speaking agenda to talk and \n&gt; use some new devices for half the group at a time, but I heard Frank \n&gt; might not be able to make it either.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope to meet you and April at a future event sometime...\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike (UFO Geek)\n&gt; http://www.ufogeek.com\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Allen&quot; &lt;amuck944@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mike,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I like the microphone. What did you use if you don&#39;t mind giving\n&gt; &gt; specifics?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; April and I will be at the Stanley also. We will be selling TAPS\n&gt; &gt; merchandise and magazines. Stop by if you get a chance. We would\n&gt; &gt; like to meet you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Allen Slaughter\n&gt;"}
