No, I don't think I am being too critical, but I may have expectation=
s that are a little too high. =C2=A0I want to take my time with this. =C2=
=A0For my own understanding, I need to have a large sample size so I know n=
ot only what to expect to see, but what to look for. =C2=A0I have seen ITC =
snapshots from programs like this that offer full faces. =C2=A0I would be m=
ore inclined to believe in such an image as opposed to, lets say. two dark =
lines that may or may not be eyebrows. 


Even in your example of the towel=
, you get half a face. =C2=A0If you have half a face (on the vertical plane=
, not the horizontal) you can extrapolate out what the entire face would lo=
ok like. =C2=A0This is something I would like to get myself and I would con=
sider that evidence if it showed up in one of these programs. =C2=A0But, if=
 you have something that looks like a forehead and that is all there is, th=
en it could also look like a rock or some other such object.


I am certain=
ly hoping for results worked into box sessions. =C2=A0Directing a session w=
ith intent, like saying "I am going to examine the sound waves of this comm=
unication in hopes of seeing your face. =C2=A0Is it possible you can show y=
our face to me now through sound? " is what I am after. =C2=A0If a positive=
 hit like this happens, then I will be jumping for joy. =C2=A0Another good =
example would be a name, lets say Tom, that occurs. =C2=A0If you get a posi=
tive affirmation that the name you heard is present, then you try the same =
technique only you address Tom by name and get a face, that would be even b=
etter.


But, as it stands now, the faces as they appear are random at best=
. =C2=A0I would be more inclined to believe that when these faces do occur =
, they are going to occur with a lesser frequency than multiple images in a=
 few seconds of audio like Ursula's example. =C2=A0If this where the case, =
there would be dozens, and possibly hundreds, of faces during a ten minute =
session and I just don't think that is possible. =C2=A0This is why I need t=
o look at several samples to find out if this is the case or not. =C2=A0If =
these partialized faces occur in multiples all the time, I would be more ap=
t to discount it. =C2=A0But, if they are a rarity affixed to only a few cli=
ps out of dozens, I would be more inclined to believe in them. =C2=A0Sample=
 size is everything. =C2=A0It is like listening to GBC. =C2=A0If you have n=
ever done a session before, you would be inclined to believe every stray ra=
dio signal is a communication. =C2=A0Only by continued practice (expanding =
your sample size) can you start to
 rule out stray radio with any degree of=
 accuracy. =C2=A0


On the other hand, I am very new to this and I could ce=
rtainly be wrong. =C2=A0I will continue to plug sound into the programs and=
 hope for the best. =C2=A0


I really want this to work. =C2=A0As you have =
probably experienced, when they want you to hear something or know somethin=
g, they make it very obvious while communicating. =C2=A0I am hoping they ap=
ply this same rigor to this new format to show us that they are there. =C2=
=A0If they can, then the world of video and audio ITC will merge in one sou=
rce and then the skeptics be damned!

<DIV>The whole point of my post, had you read it with a cl=
ear head.  It was all about my own edification, that I, and I alone, n=
eed to keep plugging in files before I, and I alone, make a judgement about=
 MY images and whether they are real or not based upon the images they prov=
ide in contrast to the bulk of other files.  If you simply compare you=
r one image with the many circles to the youtube file, I suspect I am corre=
ct in saying that faces occur with much more rarity than your circle file a=
nd that they can appear fully formed.  Once again, I suspect, only, an=
d I will only be able to tell after time.  Sample size is everything, =
and I thought I made that abundantly clear.  The post was simply about=
 my process of learning rather than running out and saying look what I foun=
d when I simply don't know what has been found yet because it is the first =
time I have played with the controls rather than seeing the end snapshots o=
n another
 persons website.  </DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Why do you al=
ways jump on the defensive and attack every one who does not fall in line w=
ith you?  Not everything has to be fight or flight, Ursula, and not ev=
ery bridge has to be burned so thoroughly to the ground.  This is not =
an attack on you or results, reread the post, and this time thinking a litt=
le more clearly about what is written on the page and not your own emotiona=
l backlash construing things in the posted text that are simply not there. =
 Had you done this, you would have seen the point of my post was not a=
n attack on you, in ANY way.    </DIV>

<DIV>No, I don't think=
 I am being too critical, but I may have expectations that are a little too=
 high.  I want to take my time with this.  For my own understandi=
ng, I need to have a large sample size so I know not only what to expect to=
 see, but what to look for.  I have seen ITC snapshots from programs l=
ike this that offer full faces.  I would be more inclined to believe i=
n such an image as opposed to, lets say. two dark lines that may or may not=
 be eyebrows. 
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Even in your example of the towel, you =
get half a face.  If you have half a face (on the vertical plane, not =
the horizontal) you can extrapolate out what the entire face would look lik=
e.  This is something I would like to get myself and I would consider =
that evidence if it showed up in one of these programs.  But, if you h=
ave something that looks like a forehead and that is all there is, then it =
could also look like a rock or some other such object.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV=
>
<DIV>I am certainly hoping for results worked into box sessions.  Di=
recting a session with intent, like saying "I am going to examine the sound=
 waves of this communication in hopes of seeing your face.  Is it poss=
ible you can show your face to me now through sound? " is what I am after. =
 If a positive hit like this happens, then I will be jumping for joy. =
 Another good example would be a name, lets say Tom, that occurs. &nbs=
p;If you get a positive affirmation that the name you heard is present, the=
n you try the same technique only you address Tom by name and get a face, t=
hat would be even better.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>But, as it stands now,=
 the faces as they appear are random at best.  I would be more incline=
d to believe that when these faces do occur , they are going to occur with =
a lesser frequency than multiple images in a few seconds of audio like Ursu=
la's example.  If this where the case, there would be dozens, and poss=
ibly hundreds, of faces during a ten minute session and I just don't think =
that is possible.  This is why I need to look at several samples to fi=
nd out if this is the case or not.  If these partialized faces occur i=
n multiples all the time, I would be more apt to discount it.  But, if=
 they are a rarity affixed to only a few clips out of dozens, I would be mo=
re inclined to believe in them.  Sample size is everything.  It i=
s like listening to GBC.  If you have never done a session before, you=
 would be inclined to believe every stray radio signal is a communication. =
 Only by continued practice
 (expanding your sample size) can you star=
t to rule out stray radio with any degree of accuracy.  </DIV>
<DIV><B=
R></DIV>
<DIV>On the other hand, I am very new to this and I could certainl=
y be wrong.  I will continue to plug sound into the programs and hope =
for the best.  </DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>I really want this to work.=
  As you have probably experienced, when they want you to hear somethi=
ng or know something, they make it very obvious while communicating.  =
I am hoping they apply this same rigor to this new format to show us that t=
hey are there.  If they can, then the world of video and audio ITC wil=
l merge in one source and then the skeptics be damned!</DIV>

<DIV> I think it's unrealistic to expect e=
very file to have faces and images. These faces are often just portions, ey=
es and lips, some have eye brows. Like all of this, not done for proof, it'=

<DIV>I saw =
