<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, pissed the guy off, and apparently he quit. Same old stuff, ignore all facts, ignore all research from around the world, then say there&#x27;s been no advancement, and wonder why I take on an attitude. Don&#x27;t present any results, just start proclaiming crap---BITE ME! Once again I was not suitabley impressed by BOZO.

&gt; &gt;  Why would anyone want to do white noise shit when there is so much
&gt; more advanced systems and methods available?
&gt; 
&gt; 1/I was not talking about white noise %$#@ as you so eloquently put
&gt; it.Did you even read the link.I was sending you to a page on an advanced
&gt; system/philosophy.If you cannot read anything without trying to be
&gt; insulting..why bother to reply.?

&gt;   Most work better than the box, as I ahve stated many times. Always some
&gt; clown that ignores all facts and evidence!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Since the evp field has hardly evolved in the last 30 years
&gt; &gt; &gt; scientifically at least I decided to download this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http://stores.lulu.com/evp &gt;  ebook the other day.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I realise that many of you would not know of a scientist called Alex
&gt; &gt; &gt; McCrae but instead of wandering around with a tape recorder/any
&gt; device
&gt; &gt; &gt; and then postng up examples for discussion,and thinking thats
&gt; cutting
&gt; &gt; &gt; edge.. he has taken the genre about 20 steps past that.
&gt; &gt; &gt; He is one of the few to use faraday cages/blind tests on subject to
&gt; rule
&gt; &gt; &gt; out pareidolia/going to differernt countries and still getting evp
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; his language..finding commonlaity with evp voices and the voice that
&gt; &gt; &gt; some people with some  forms of mental illness &quot;hear&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; From his site
&gt; &gt; &gt; Science Proves Spirits Exist!Science Proves Spirits Exist! You
&gt; already
&gt; &gt; &gt; knew that?Cool but now no one can argue with you about it.Just
&gt; &gt; &gt; point to the EVIDENCE!With the kind permission of the Institute of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Noetic Sciences [yes, the people mentioned in Dan Brown&#x27;s book!]
&gt; &gt; &gt; retired Scottish scientist Alexander MacRae carried out a key
&gt; experiment
&gt; &gt; &gt; at their laboratory in California.Read the evidence in The Portal
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Part One &lt;http://stores.lulu.com/evp &gt;  .
&gt; &gt; &gt; From the cricket noises no one is doing reel to reel work anymore
&gt; here
&gt; &gt; &gt; like Sarah Estep.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fair enough.. [:D]
