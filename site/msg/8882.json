I have to admit that I&#39;ve listen to countless hours of case files evps and have gotten great evps over the years.  However, I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ve still learned the art of ghost box or evpm listening even though I&#39;ve been running both every night for a while.  I think  I still haven&#39;t gotten the knack of listening to these styles yet, but I won&#39;t give up.\n\nBryan\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: bruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt;\nTo: evp-itc@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Thursday, April 3, 2008 5:01:06 PM\nSubject: RE: [EVP-ITC] EVP Maker (allaphone file) Method Test\n\n                Ron,\n \nThere is no folder for you in the files section.\nMaybe it got lost in the shuffle.

I have posted a file of my test with EVPM allaphones under ronriko files.  I forward this for two reasons:  the first as a request from Bruce to determine recurring words and second because I wanted to have experienced ears hear my recording for comments.   Regarding the test, this is just 30 secs or so of a 7 minute recording.  Recorded at 90% using EVPmaker with xcross.  I was able to hear &quot;art and arthor&quot; a number of times within the 7 minutes.  This is after requesting no names be spoken.  \n \nRegarding my experiences with evpmaker and the allaphone file sent by Stefan, I must say my results have been underwhelming.  I hear nothing but evp gibberish.  I ask that anyone with an ear for this to give a listen and tell me if you hear anything intelligent.  I am in a terrible radio zone here in Mexico so I have high hopes on EVP maker and the file Stefan provided.  Also excited about the fact that so many others are getting excellent communications.  Thank you to anyone who takes the time to listen to and confirm my recordings.  I am beginning to feel like I am being blocked out like William had thought.  Maybe I am in a true dead zone, no pun intended, or &quot;they&quot; don&#39;t want me in the loop for some reason.
