<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi All;

I think I over reacted when I thought maybe Bill Murphy, or Rosemary Guiley 
were using the boxes inappropriately. For that I apologize.


What Rosemary was doing by &quot;imprinting&quot; the boxes was not in itself not 
incorrect, and may actually help the communcations, after all she has 
written several books, and is much more knowledgeable than I on things 
paranormal.  Bill seems to be an honest researcher, and he is a likeable guy 
in person.

I apologize to everyone for becoming maybe too sensitive to others ideas 
about how the boxes should be used.

Frank-S
