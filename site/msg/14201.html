  Hi April,

  I have bee=
n out today, first day my poison ivy would let me back out of the house.  I=
 made good on my escape, LOL.  If everyone will bear with me I think I reca=
ll the files, involved.  This happened just a little over a year ago, and I=
 think I still have the files.  When I find them I will let you know the fi=
le types and the destination and origin of the files.  I had a computer cra=
sh since that time and I will have to back to backup files to extract and r=
estore the files. I think that I got a copy of the file that our member had=
 that was a total loss as a copy, with the data loss.  The data loss was gr=
eat enough that the file did not come close to the original.  I got in my c=
ar and drove over to my team members home to listen to the file I ad sent h=
im by e-mail through Yahoo I believe. I 'll verify that too.

  I will try =
to get you guys the information on the files by tomorrow night.  I hope eve=
ryone had a great weekend.


  Regards,
  Jon in Texas

it. I have also heard of it happening to a few other people. After my conve=

you can experience loss in attached files.

  I don't know if you would be =

Just because the data has been replaced, doesn't have to mean it is perfect=
.

  Did you listen to the before and after results?

  Jon-Please relay yo=

          I can't vouch for your computer or servers, but I just did s=
ome tests, and sent a 2.1MB wav file from MSN to Yahoo and back, once allow=
ing compression, and once turning it off.   I was able to verify that one w=
as compressed and one was not, by checking the sizes when they arrived at Y=
ahoo. Once they came back to MSN, I then did a bit-level comparison of the =
original, and the ones sent around email.  They were all identical, which i=
ndicates lossless compression.

          If you have a file you'd like me =
to test for you, let me know.  But I wouldn't take someone's word for how y=
our server's work, without testing them yourself.

           For executables, you may be right. However, for wav files, the c=
ompression during email is not loss less. 

            I used to think as =
you do, in that the emailed attachment of a wav file would not loose anythi=
ng. After a lengthy discourse with another member here, I learned that I wa=
s wrong. The reason why I did not realize it in the first place is that whe=
n I would email a wav file, I would intentionally keep it in very small seg=
ments, to keep file size down. This was just for ease of transfer. But beca=
use of this, I had not experienced any noticeable loss.

            Now it=
 may be in some cases, depending on the servers or what have you that the f=
ile goes through, that the loss may be less or more. But once the attachmen=
t is downloaded, the quality has been found to be less then the original wa=
v.

            Again though you can only really tell when the wav file is =
large.

                    The kind of compression that occurs during an email a=
ttachment is "lossless": it compress the file cleverly without losing infor=
mation.  For example, if I had a program in some .exe files, and I sent it =
over email, it could compress it.  But if it lost even one bit, the resulti=
ng exe file would not execute again after it was uncompressed on the other =
side.

                    This kind of compression does things like lookin=
g for common patterns in the file, and replacing them with a token.  A roug=
h example would be if it found "Howdy Neighbor" in a file 20 times, it coul=
d replace all the occurances with say $HN1.  And also write a little dictio=
nary in there someplace that says "$HN1=3DHowdy Neighbor".

               =
     When the file gets to its destination it can be uncompressed, and all =
occurences of $HN1 are replaced with "Howdy Neighbor".  So it was compresse=
d (instead of 14 characters each, it only needed 4, plus the dictionary), b=
ut lost no data.

                    Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are =
not lossless.  Depending on the level of compression, some level of data is=
 lost, and so cannot be recovered or reconstructed later.

                      Another thing:

                      I recen=
tly found this out. When you email a file, if it is not saved as a compress=
ed format, the email filtering process will actually compress the file auto=
matically.

                      So even if you have attached a wav. file,=
 it will loose resolution over the email process. It will not sound exactly=
 the same as the original wav. file. How much it differs depends on the siz=
e of the file you are attaching. If it is a very large file, it will sound =
much different.

                      The only exception to this is if the=
 wav. file is small enough that the filtering process will ignore it. It ha=
s to be pretty small though, like under 1 MB (I am not exactly sure of the =
threshold).

                      The best way to share files over the int=
ernet if you want them as close to the original as possible is to upload th=
em directly to a website.

                              Pixelization doesn't clean-up the data: it re=

o add levels or pixelization to the picture.  Soon, you would not be able t=
o tell there were flowers there at all.  You would see a lot of colored blo=
cks.

                              Or in the other direction, imagine you =
are looking at a competely randomize bunch of pixes on your screen: a compl=
ete screen of truely random static snow.  Pixelizing this, after a while, y=
ou would again start to see colored blocks.

                              =
What's happening is that it is processing an area of the image, taking (for=
 instance) the average value of that entire area, and replacing all the blo=
cks in that area with the average.  In video processing, this would result =
in a field of multi-colored flowers being replaced by, for instance, a big =
greyish-bluish block, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the noise example=

ock.  If you did not know beforehand what the original picture was, you cou=
ldn't tell whether your pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a ch=
evy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.

                   =
           It works the same with the sound files.  Taking something as com=

Doing the same to random static will eventually produce the same thing.  An=

, you could have fun sharing with each other what you thing they 'sound lik=

                                Be a b=
it careful of formats like mp3 if you are doing a detailed analysis of the =
sounds though.   While some formats (like wav) can store the audio very clo=
se to the way it was recorded, formats like mp3 compress the file, and in s=
o doing lose some of the sonic details.  This may not be a big deal in musi=
c, where the audio is fairly clear to begin with.  But with sound sources w=
ith a lot of noise (like evps), this can not only obscure any real sounds, =
but pixelize non-sounds (like white noise) and make them start to sound lik=
e speech.

                                So mp3 might be good for sharing=
 the data, once you've already formed an opinion based on an analysis of th=
e wav file.  But mp3 is not good as a medium for analysis.  It can lead to =
many false positives and misinterpretations.
