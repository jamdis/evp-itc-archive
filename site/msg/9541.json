I have taken Monroe&#39;s &quot;Gateway Experience&quot; course.  :-)\n\nI have long observed there seems to be subjects that aren&#39;t open for discussion, and was \nrecently told via EVPMaker/allophones that such restrictions fall under something called \n&quot;Article 8.&quot;\n\nI have not gathered any indications, personally, that we are being exploited.  I have always \ntaken this lack of information to be similar to that of an adult, who does not share with \nchildren, material that is age inappropriate.  In this case, WE humans are the children of \nthe universe.\n\nWhat is your definition of &quot;serious research&quot; and how do you suggest we enlist of the aid \nof QUALIFIED scientists who, for the most part, are not willing to have their reputations \ntarnished by associating themselves with such research?\n\nMargaret\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Nathan Sharman &lt;v1230mail@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi read books by Robert Monroe.\n&gt; \n&gt; He had the ability to travel out of the body and go to\n&gt; the Astral.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are Technologically advanced Aliens that seem to\n&gt; control the political situation in the Astral planes,\n&gt; and they do not want Earth humans to develop full\n&gt; communication with human spirits in the Astral.\n&gt; \n&gt; WE HUMANS ARE BEING EXPLOITED IN THE ASTRAL PLANES,\n&gt; that is why when communications are going good, all of\n&gt; a sudden you no longer hear from the spirit any more,\n&gt; THAT IS BECAUSE THE SPIRIT WAS FORBIDDEN to\n&gt; communicate further.\n&gt; \n&gt; WE NEED TO START DOING SERIOUS RESEARCH AND NOT GET\n&gt; ALL EXCITED TO JUST HEAR VOICES.\n&gt; \n&gt; WE also need to study the physics involved, this is\n&gt; high energy physics.\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?
