I can hear and understand posts...seems the RS  or Mini box were a bit clearer...Didn't hear the question for the "watch yourselves" response....what were they responding to.  
   
  Also, Buce, would you please listen to the test post I have on file.   Frank said he got a message.  I would be delighted if there is something there, but I can't hear it.  That is my concern...how do I learn to hear messages through my garbage recordings?   Ron L
