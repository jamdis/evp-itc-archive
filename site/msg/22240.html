Yep, this was the guy Norberg, I had the date of his death wrong, it was  
81, I didn't understand what David the tech was saying, and Norberg, killed 
all  those kids, so it was more then 4 kids, there is a list.  "This is one 
guy  who will be completely destroyed at Judgement, he will never get to the  
Light."  sf
