Whoa Dave! It looks like you and I were in the same circles last night I had a john Lennon one too and I never get those. I posted it to group last night for ya. I hear one of those exactly as you did the other 2 about JL differ in wording from what you heard. Here is what I heard in the order you posted.
   
  "hello john lennon was present"
"absolutely a new process approaching"
"john lennon says- he's haunting you"

"John Lennon......their testing without Lennon" 
"Absolutely positive..A new process" (this has an accent) 
"Lennons home...I'm impressed with recording"

Hi Misty, thanks for the comment. I get lots of testing messages, most are not clear enough to post. Last night I tried the remote (basement) Tesla coil using the AM radio sweep upstairs. The overall noise was way to high on the AM band. Even though the session was in large part a failure, a message was still left towards the end of the session. 
"Bad filter, they won't like it"

Yeah I like that idea too. And I can hear those Dave, and I was testing last night as well.

Good idea Frank, different modes may work better under different conditions. I got this message last night. 

"They're testing, to talk to dead people"

Thanks, yeah I can hear that voice ok. I'll try electroninc tuning, as I 
have the board all made, just have to add some switching for different 
modes. I want random, linear, and manual tuning on the same box.
