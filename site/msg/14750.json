Since the tapping was continual\n and you noticed an EM spike there is another possibility.\n\n You could have detected a PK event. In poltergeist cases we have come\n to realize that living PK agents often are responsible. These agents\n function in environments with specific characteristics and themselves\n exhibit specific traits. One of the environmental characteristics is\n an elevated magnetic field. Often this is a geomagnetic field as seems\n to be the case in extreme poltergeist cases. Less extremem cases, \n such as this may be, we often see elevated EM field levels. Do your\n readings in your notes? Were you reading electrical or magnetic\n fields? What type of EMF meter were you using? This might help\n determine if the info you noticed was potentially related to PK\n effects.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;April Abercrombie&quot; &lt;april@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Let&#39;s try it again.\n&gt;"}
