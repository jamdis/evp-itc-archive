<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ken, the mantis head beings also appear purple. The color image halfway 
down the page is similar to what I witnessed along with several other 
people during a meditation excercise that was the lead in to a 
dimensional portal building workshop.

 Frank, when you mentioned the &quot;purples&quot; to me while I was in CO, I 
immediately thought of my experience but your description was 
different. My encounter was with a mantis head being.

p.s. we&#x27;ve been operating and recording some box sessions. During our 
first sessions, the box seemed to be calling your name like it did when 
we visited you. Through verbally stated intention, I communicated that 
you have provided me with the box for continued research. Our last two 
sessions began by my name being announced by the box. It&#x27;s almost as if 
the spirit technicians (or etheral beings) now recognize my energy 
signature being imprinted in this particular box.
