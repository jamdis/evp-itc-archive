Many of the\nmodern digital radios have a function that mutes, or quiets the radio while\ntuning between stations. I&#39;m not sure why, but unmutting the radio allows\nthe audio to be heard while the radio searches for the next\nstation--and--the radio is disallowed form locking onto a station, so it\nkeeps sweeping all the way to the end of the band--AM or FM, then starts\nover. This creates the raw audio and &quot;they&quot; speak. The sweep can even be\ndone by hand, tuning a radio slowing by hand. I sue cheap radios I get at\nthrift stores for this, gluing a dowel to the tuning knob to make it easier.\nThen record form the speaker--open air.\n\n So as long as the radio sweeps at not to fast and not too slow, it&#39;ll\nworks. Some are better than others.\n\n It takes some practice, and maybe even a certain allowing to hear the ghost\nvoices.\n\n I prefer to take a tuner out of a radio, such as a clock radio and supply\nan external sweep voltage. The sweep circuits are just basic op amps, and\nyou can buy a function generator kit to supply a triangle wave for linear\nsweep. See keyportparanormal.com for more info on using this kit, and\nbuilding boxes.\n\n One problem with this stuff is that it can be extremely subjective, others\nmay not hear what you hear, or hear it the same. I think mostly the messages\nare meant for the one that receives it. We go round and round with the\nskeptics and debunkers.\n\n F-S\nOn Sun, Aug 29, 2010 at 11:08 PM, usmcmacswife &lt;usmcmacswife@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok, we&#39;re new here hello!\n&gt;\n&gt; We just had a couple questions.
