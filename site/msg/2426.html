I was checking out a little boom box here, and decided to do a quickie ses=
sion using manual sweep of the AM band. This is at work(don't tell the boss=
!). 
 
The one about the male dog might refer to the mate to this female po=
odle we have now. For those unfamilar, our daughter in-law knows someone th=
at rescues dogs, and she was tryuing to get rid of some of her too many ani=
mals. The daughter in-law at first gave us the male poodle a few weeks ago,=
 but he was deaf, blind, and someone, probably the puppy mill he came from,=
 pulled all his teeth. He was too much to deal with, he fell down our stair=
s twice, and we felt he was suffereing too much, so we took him to the Dumb=
 Friends League. Now we have his mate, but she has most of her teeth, and c=
an hear, see and is a little sweetie. #4 is hopefully accurate.
