<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Using the boxes in the way Frank does, it wold be pointless. Frank depends
on the radios actually picking up stations and the communicators arranging
the voices from the stations into some sort of assembly that sounds like a
message. If you can&#x27;t get radio stations, there&#x27;s no reson to do it.

If you&#x27;re trying to get EVP in some other manner, it might be interesting
but you&#x27;d have to bring the Faraday cage to the haunted site by truck.

&gt; I just had a thought go thru my head ( Oh shit ).What would happen if you
&gt; put a voice recorder in a
&gt; Faraday Cage, and have a session with a ghost box.... The Faraday Cage
&gt; isn&#x27;t supposed to pick up radio
&gt; interference right ? Would it pick up the other voices or not ? I know the
&gt; entities are talking thru the radio
&gt; but has anyone ever tried it ? Stupid question huh ?????
