It&#39;s just a matter of making\n&gt; &gt; little jumpers with small wire to bridge the breaks. Radio shack \nhas\n&gt; &gt; #30 wire wrap wire that works well for that kind of stuff. Maybe\n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s enough of the original pad left on the connectors that you\n&gt; &gt; could glue them back in place, then jumper the breaks.

You&#39;ll see the copper colored conductor under the \nmask.  \n&gt; &gt; Then you aplly some solder to conductor, and some to the wire, \nthen  \n&gt; &gt; heat the two togther to join them.

We&#39;re not extremely \ntalented\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; electronics area, but we have fun and seem to muddle by. No\n&gt; &gt; guts no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; glory, huh?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, for the most part the operation has been a success. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; photographed every step of the way and taped screws and \nparts\n&gt; &gt; to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; photos so we&#39;d know how to rebuild everything we took \napart, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has worked just fine. I located the IR filter, removed it \nand\n&gt; &gt; cut\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; replaced it with a piece of glass slide.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The one problem we ran into is that there were two wires \nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appeared\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be clipped in place as opposed to being soldered or \nscrewed\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything else. When we tried to pry the clips open, \ninstead\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whole thing came off the circuit board. WE HAVE NO CLUE HOW \nTO\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PROCEED\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; FROM HERE. I don&#39;t know if we can just glue the darn things\n&gt; &gt; down and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if so, what type of glue to use, or if we&#39;re just plain up \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; creek.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I immediately thought of this group of brainy electronics\n&gt; &gt; buffs. I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hoping someone out there can give us some advice, or if you \nlive\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Highlands Ranch, CO, you could help in person & bail us out \nof\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was hoping to take this camera to the St. Augustine \nLighthouse\n&gt; &gt; at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; end of this coming week.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any hope? I&#39;ve posted a photo of an extreme \ncloseup of\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clips (one is pink, the other is ivory) and the damaged \nboard --\n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to sandwich two photos together to get both in focus at the \nsame\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (that&#39;s why it looks that way). For an idea of scale, the \nclips\n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both the same size, about 4 mm in width, 4 mm tall, 3 mm \ndeep.\n&gt; &gt; Not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy to handle and even harder to see with these middle age\n&gt; &gt; eyes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.tejadadesign.com/camera/splice.jpg\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any advice would be GREATLY APPRECIATED!!
