&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; What questions do you ask now?
&gt; 
&gt; ------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Here are some I like to ask:
&gt; 
&gt; Is it OK if I record your voice?
&gt; 
&gt; Is it OK if I take your picture?
&gt; 
&gt; What is your name?
&gt; 
&gt; Do you know where you are?
&gt; 
&gt; Do you know what year it is?
&gt; 
&gt; When were you born?
&gt; 
&gt; Where were you born?
&gt; 
&gt; When did you die?
&gt; 
&gt; What was your cause of death?
&gt; 
&gt; Do you enjoy being here?
&gt; 
&gt; Are there others here with you?
&gt; 
&gt; Do you want (me) (us) to leave?
&gt; 
&gt; Is it OK if we stay?
&gt; 
&gt; Do you enjoy having visitors?
&gt; 
&gt; Does any of your family ever visit you?
&gt; 
&gt; Is it OK if we come back again?
&gt; 
&gt; Do you like sports? (Baseball?) (Football?) etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Did you have any hobbies?
&gt; 
&gt; What do you miss the most?
&gt; 
&gt; -------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ve gotten some interesting responses.  Last year I asked &quot;Do you 
know 
&gt; what year it is?&quot; and a woman&#x27;s voice plainly said &quot;1996&quot;. On one 
&gt; investigation I asked &quot;Do you want us to leave?&quot; and a male voice 
said 
&gt; &quot;You just got here.&quot; At another site someone asked &quot;What was your 
cause 
&gt; of death?&quot; and I heard &quot;poisoning&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; It&#x27;s funny when the ghosts join in on your conversations even 
though 
&gt; you&#x27;re not asking questions.  Some of them are very playful.
&gt; 
&gt; I was on one investigation a couple years ago when someone 
asked &quot;Do you 
&gt; know the Cubs are in the World Series this year?&quot;  :-)
&gt; 
&gt; If you are at the location of a tombstone you can ask if the 
person is 
&gt; (name on tombstone) or knows (name on tombstone).
&gt; 
&gt; I hope those help a little bit.

&gt; &gt; I want to do another EVP session with the box, but am tired of 
asking
&gt; &gt; the same questions.  Does anybody have any good relevant 
questions i
&gt; &gt; could ask?
