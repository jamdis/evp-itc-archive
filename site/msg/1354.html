<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Aw, geez, guys...apply a little scientific reasoning, will you?! The 
biggest question here is how much energy is going IN to the radio 
wave generator and that&#x27;s easy to calculate (and, very conspicuously, 
not mentioned in any article/video I&#x27;ve found on this). If the energy 
in is greater than the energy out - there is no free lunch and the 
First Law of Thermodynamics continues to hold...

As for a cancer-fighting device...now that has potential. Of course, 
there are questions there, too. Like: are the &quot;nano&quot; impurities ONLY 
(or signficantly) absorbed by cancerous tissue? If not, the process 
may not be much more precise than manual cutting! And what exactly is 
the mechanism of death for the cancer cells? If it&#x27;s by localized 
heating - the body has to get rid of it and will the hot residue of 
the dead cancer cells significantly transfer to surrounding healthy 
cells thus causing their death, too? Again - a scalpel could be 
almost as effective, if so.

Anyone have anything to post on EVP/ITC?

&gt; The same machine also holds promise for curing cancer. He will have 
the drug and oil interests attention. I hope it can work in both 
arenas of energy and health and won&#x27;t be supressed.

&gt;    
&gt;   thats a sodium flame
&gt;    
&gt;   which means there an efficient production and recombination of 
atomic hydrogen and atomic chlorine.  the recombination is so highly 
exothermic that more energy could be produced than is expended.  at 
the expense of cooling the surroundings
&gt;    
&gt;    
&gt;   in theory, this can be a free lunch - but well have to wait and
