I feel that is what is great about\nthis community.  Each of us has our own opinions.  I just only hope that you\ncan respect mine as I do yours.  Healthly debates are good.  I just feel\nthat some people just need a little direction as I did.  To me in the end it\nyes it does just and feul to the fire.  Isn&#39;t that how we change peoples\nminds, by debating our opinions.  I mean, I would have never found this\nplace if it wasn&#39;t for a debate on another site.  All Frank is doing is\nstanding up for what he (and we) believe in.

The ones that will be\n&gt; swayed without looking into all the facts aren&#39;t your friends anyway.\n&gt; Getting into petty arguments with these people just brings you down to their\n&gt; level. You look far more credible if you don&#39;t even give them any heed.\n&gt; People who are worthy of your energy and really want to know the truth\n&gt; will look at both sides objectively. They will come to the source, as I\n&gt; have.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the end, it will only cause more problems for you if you engage these\n&gt; types.\n&gt;\n&gt; Besides that, who cares what ANYONE thinks? Who cares who sways who? Frank\n&gt; should be doing this for himself first and foremost. He is not going to be\n&gt; able to prove his recordings scientifically, so why bother to compete? All\n&gt; he needs to do is prove them to himself.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is a total different thing to try and debunk evidence to actually prove\n&gt; something. The skeptic debunks things so that he may be left with true\n&gt; proof.\n&gt;\n&gt; That is not what these debunkers do. These guys say everything is\n&gt; a debunked, without ever really testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; You are always willing to test new theories and technologies to really see\n&gt; the truth of it yourself. This is why you are not a debunker. If you were a\n&gt; debunker, you wouldn&#39;t even try.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; *From:* Eric VanDuzer &lt;evanduzer@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; *Sent:* Tuesday, April 28, 2009 1:38 PM\n&gt; *Subject:* Re: [EVP-ITC] A skeptic blog/article.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Honestly Frank I say slap too.  I know that I am not very active in this\n&gt; group but I do read everything.  To me that was a pure attack.  Yes they are\n&gt; debunkers and they won&#39;t believe anything, but if you don&#39;t say anything and\n&gt; just back down there is that one person out there that will be swayed they\n&gt; way of the skeptic and will not here our side.  Slap away and let us be\n&gt; heard and get our opinions and beliefs out there.  If it touches one person\n&gt; (Like me I used to be one of those &quot;debunkers&quot; then I heard the stuff that\n&gt; comes through ITC and EVP research) it is worth the carpal tunnel.  And to\n&gt; add I am a investigator who still uses a debunking aspect toward the\n&gt; investigation,  but I am also a researcher and if there is something new out\n&gt; there I am always willing to test it and see what comes through.\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Apr 28, 2009 at 3:17 PM, Fransen, Debbie &lt;debbie.fransen@...\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  YES, yes I do.........LMAO\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  ------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;  *From:* EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com [mailto:EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com] *On\n&gt;&gt; Behalf Of *April Abercrombie\n&gt;&gt; *Sent:* Tuesday, April 28, 2009 2:56 PM\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *To:* EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; *Subject:* Re: [EVP-ITC] A skeptic blog/article.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    You just want to watch LOL!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;&gt; *From:* Fransen, Debbie &lt;debbie.fransen@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *To:* EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; *Sent:* Tuesday, April 28, 2009 12:48 PM\n&gt;&gt; *Subject:* RE: [EVP-ITC] A skeptic blog/article.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  I say slap them Frank.
