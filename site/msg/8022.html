William, 
                   I know this was directed for Misty, but if I may I would like to also answer your question.
   
                   The natural back ground noise is used as a "carrier" to reveal the presence of undetectable signals in an ambient.  Misty and many others use water as a source.  I use tap water running in an ambient as the source of white noise.  Other noise sources can be used, such as  a fan, or AM radio tuned between the stations (which is also used by many on this board.) 
                     It is important to call your attention to the act that the voices are very weak, and trained ears are necessary for their identification in most cases.  It is very hard because only a few words will become clear among many minutes or hours of tape recording vs. box research.  This was in my case and I use to get completely frustrated in the process.
   
                      Some researchers have upgraded their systems using a germanium diode plugged into the tape recorder's microphone input (1N34 or equivalent).  The noise generated by this component, and also ambient detected radio signals, are used as well.
   
                      I have in the past also left a fan running as wind source, which also proved effective.
   
                     I applaud those who focus on this form of communication, for its a lot of hard work and in my opinion.  It takes time, and patience none of which I seem to have anymore and find the box communication more rewarding.
   
  Just my thoughts!

  What is the water method?

        I find some like certain methods better to make thier voice. And often they will state thier approval or disapproval for the method I am experimenting with. A few do not like music method they say its too much noise they cant get a word in edgewise, yet others enjoy it and make use of it with ease speaking very loud over the music notes. For water method nobody complains (i dont know why) and for sweep methods, only a few seem to have trouble using it to form thier words.
   
  Perhaps it has to do with vibrational frequencies I dont know. Once the lines are open and communication is flowing it gets interesting to say the least =)
   
  Just experiment and find whats working best for you personally.

      This is an interesting conversation. Personally, I use my hack to
communicate with a spirit who is definitely grounded. Sometimes the
communications come through as bits of radio waves put together to
form words or sentences, and other times, they sound more like
traditional evps. One of the little things I'm trying to figure out
is why I could never get evps from him after a year of trying, but he
has taken to communicating through the box like a fish to water.
