<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Also Ron Rickets now uses a micro controller for his miniboxes. With that, you can control step in Hz, Rate, 
Dwell and track an analog input for a random mode. 
 
Here is a link with one at pretty low cost.

I don&#x27;t know how involved you wanted to get, but i was thinking of using this myself.  I just choose to keep it much simpler, i still get good results.

&gt; I don&#x27;t think that the minibox schematics were ever public knowledge.  I do know that it is based off of the MK484 chip, which frank uses in his TRF boxes so he might have that for you.
&gt; 
&gt; I also know that each box changes and is different, i have a page of some of those schematics.
