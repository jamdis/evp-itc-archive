Subject: [EVP-ITC] Just starting a bekind to all thread here !!!


  Hi all=
 you EVP and ITC buffs,

  It's me again Ralph just wanting to throw some l=
ove around here to 
  maybe get back to what this group is all about. That =
is friendship 
  and sharing files and experiments and Ideas of how we can =
better 
  ourselves for making contact with the other side and getting down=
 to 
  the Nitty Gritty without the negativity. That sounds like a song LOL=
. 
  Well I myself respect everyone in this group I admire all your hard 
 =
 work you guys do and the amount of time you put forth to try to 
  underst=
and what all of this is leading to. Your efforts are 
  relentless. I mysel=
f can only put forth alittle time of what I can 
  spare, because of my wor=
k and my Wife ( who puts up with all this 
  managery ). You see my Wife is=
 Italian and she is all about Family 
  and I have to deal with all of her =
relatives (all 2,000 of them),just 
  kidding. They all like to visit and y=
ou know how that is LOL !! So I 
  do this when I have the chance. I envy a=
ll of you that can really get 
  down and dirty with all of your research a=
nd experiments like you all 
  do. I wish I had the time to be like you guy=
s. I love the fact that 
  you all share your findings and files and though=
ts on how to do 
  things better and how you help others who are new to thi=
s field like 
  me. So all I can say is don't let negativity get this group=
 down and 
  just keep on doing what you all are here for people. What I he=
ar from 
  some of you is that the other side doesn't like discord or negat=
ivty 
  in this effort to communicate with them. This is just my thoughts a=
nd 
  my feelings about it. Just throwing some Love your way to get 
  ever=
ybody back on track. I see your almost there. I just want to say 
  Peace t=
o all and Keep up the great work for the research.

  Hi Ann,

  Yes I did =
get your emails on the Chadds Ford case and will be 
  getting back to you =
soon on that. It's just something with that 
  picture that bothers me. I'l=
l talk to you about that too. Have a 
  great day Ann.

  Hi Juli,

l call you when I can about the shadowy figure that maybe 
  followed me ho=
me. I hope your doing okay Juli and will get back to

 work your doing too. Mike Colleta I really like
