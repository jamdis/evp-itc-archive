I would love to hear your recordings and see what you&#39;ve \nbeen getting.  And you are using a mobile phone....that&#39;s \ninteresting.  That continues to prove that they will use anything we \nhave to communicate.\n\nGood Job and continued success,\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;tonyandsue13&quot; &lt;tonyandsue13@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Within the last week I came across the concept of the ghost box \n&gt; (Frank&#39;s box) and have had immediate results.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is actually using a mobile phone on radio mode with a manual \nscan, \n&gt; simply holding down the button and it scans through the FM bands \neither \n&gt; up or down. There was no white noise being played at the same time \nnor \n&gt; on review.\n&gt; \n&gt; What surprised me was the clarity of the answers to direct \nquestions \n&gt; which could then be checked on a reviewing the tape. But also that \non \n&gt; one ocassion the replies weren&#39;t audible until the replay of the \ntaped \n&gt; session was heard.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this typical?\n&gt; \n&gt; I can upload the sessions which are quite interesting due to the \n&gt; subject being discussed.\n&gt;"}
