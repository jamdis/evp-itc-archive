From my experience, if they finally \ndecide you&#39;re not there to do harm they will kind of back off and leave \nyou alone.\n\nA simple thing like straightening a skewed tombstone or cleaning up a mess \nwill convince them you&#39;re not there to harm. Also, tell them that you&#39;re \nnot there to do damage.\n\nZack\n\nOn Mon, 18 Aug 2008, Chad wrote:\n\n&gt; Just wondering if you guys have ever experienced anything like what\n&gt; I&#39;m about to describe.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was doing an investigation at a cemetery the other night. My\n&gt; girlfriend was using the 469 with headphones. It started to spook her\n&gt; a little and she gave me the box. I put in the headphones and didn&#39;t\n&gt; hear anything out of the normal radio scan. Then I heard footsteps\n&gt; circling me. I started looking around and asked if anyone else was\n&gt; hearing them. I then got attacked by an entity in the cemetery. It\n&gt; felt a lot like a schoolyard bully circling you before he hits you,\n&gt; and then a big rush of  energy. I can&#39;t really describe the feeling.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then, the other night I was on a separate investigation and was in a\n&gt; bathroom. I was hearing water dripping, but when I checked the\n&gt; possible sources they were bone dry.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it possible that these noises can come clearly through the 469? I\n&gt; do not have any psychic ability I know of. They are very real, and are\n&gt; definitely happening, not being imagined. Maybe it has something to do\n&gt; with the headphones? I cannot explain this. Have any of you had a\n&gt; similar experience?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
