<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Richard,

Thats a great example and a good way to look at things. the old idea 
that energy doesnt die its just transformed holds true with that too. 
I have seen the same thing done with missing appendages, tho a finger 
may have been removed it still registers under kirlian photography as 
its energy being present.

Just because we dont see something or hear a thing doesnt mean it is 
nonexistant =) Perhaps it just means we are deaf and blind to its 
existence.

&gt; Thanks for replying to my message.
&gt; 
&gt; Years ago I watched a slide show featuring several photo&#x27;s taken via
&gt; kirlian photography. It seems kirlian photography captures certain
&gt; types of energy on film. In the demonstration a picture of a house 
was
&gt; shown. Later that same house had a fire and part of the house had 
been
&gt; burned to the ground but the photo taken with kirlian photography
&gt; later showed that part of the house still there.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m no expert but maybe energy we can&#x27;t see leaves an imprint in the
&gt; non physical universe and can be viewed or demonstrated using the
&gt; right instruments and technique. Of course I really have no clue and
&gt; am fascinated by the evp and itc phenomena.
&gt; 
&gt; Enjoyed visiting your site, thanks for the link.

&gt; &gt; Hi Richard, and welcome to the group. I am not on here much as I
&gt; &gt; usually just read the posts and contribute when I can. I am very 
busy
&gt; &gt; with my group so balancing my time isn&#x27;t easy.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I guess as of now it is hard to say whether or not an EVP is from 
a
&gt; &gt; &quot;living&quot; entity or just a sound bit floating in time. All we can 
do is
&gt; &gt; speculate on such matters, really. I think that time may lead to
&gt; &gt; finite answers to our questions, but as it stands with our limited
&gt; &gt; equipment and devices we use to measure phenomenon, we cannot say 
100%
&gt; &gt; for certain. I have my theories, as does everyone.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That being said, my personal belief is that EVP and ITC can be 
both.
&gt; &gt; Though my research has been much more focused on EVP and 
recently, on
&gt; &gt; the Radio Shack hack box, I have seen what I believe to be 
evidence of
&gt; &gt; both. I have many EVPs recorded that seem to suggest both &quot;living&quot;
&gt; &gt; entities and those that suggest residual phenomenon, or &quot;residue&quot; 
of
&gt; &gt; things in the past.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; One example is the EVP I captured at the Camp Creek Trustle in
&gt; &gt; McDonough, GA. In the EVP, the voice picked up seems to suggest 
that
&gt; &gt; he is not dead. Tou can check this file out in my folder here. 
Also,
&gt; &gt; at the investigation of the trustle, EVPs were picked up seeming 
to
&gt; &gt; answer questions. For example, when I asked what kind of music was
&gt; &gt; enjoyed by the entity, I received &quot;orcha&quot; as an response. I took 
this
&gt; &gt; to be an attempt to say &quot;orchestra,&quot; a popular music choice from 
the
&gt; &gt; early 1900&#x27;s when so many lives were lost at this spot. As for the
&gt; &gt; Radio Shack hack, just last night I was again at the trustle
&gt; &gt; conducting a hack box session. When we asked about which of us 
were in
&gt; &gt; attendance, the answer came back very clearly with two of our 
names,
&gt; &gt; &quot;Nate&quot; and &quot;Chad.&quot; These were very clear and in an area where 
radio
&gt; &gt; reception is not that great.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Perhaps one of our more compelling EVPs as they relate to whether 
or
&gt; &gt; not these are &quot;living&quot; entities we are communicating with is one 
that
&gt; &gt; we recorded in the White House located in McDonough, GA. A team 
member
&gt; &gt; was talking about someone and how poorly they kept up their yard 
when
&gt; &gt; we picked up a very clear voice saying &quot;You are so mean.&quot; On the 
same
&gt; &gt; investigation we captured a voice talking about Kurt, another
&gt; &gt; investigator and how he was stupid.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now to the other side of the coin. We have picked up &quot;EVPs&quot; of 
things
&gt; &gt; such as gunshots and cannon fire at civil war battlefields we have
&gt; &gt; visited. These appear at first to be residual sounds, yet other
&gt; &gt; aspects of the investigation seem to provide proof of intelligent
&gt; &gt; entities. Perhaps the soldiers who died in that battle are still
&gt; &gt; fighting. We cannot really say based on only the EVPs taken during
&gt; &gt; those investigations. We do have other evidence, but I will not go
&gt; &gt; into that here as this is an EVP/ITC group.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Feel free to take a look at our group&#x27;s site.
&gt; &gt; www.georgiastateparanormal.com
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am happy to send our files to anyone for research purposes if
&gt; requested.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am sure that many of the members of the group will give you 
their
&gt; &gt; theories as well on this matter, and I&#x27;m sure that as you begin to
&gt; &gt; experiment on your own that many fascinating and unexplained 
events
&gt; &gt; will present themselves to you. Good luck, and again, welcome to 
the
&gt; &gt; group.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Chad
