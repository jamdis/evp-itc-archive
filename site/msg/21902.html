<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Someone on facebook asked if I ever tried Spiricom. Sorta, I have added
tone to a couple boxes. Spiricom transmitted 13 tones that supposedly make
up human speech. Well if you use square waves, they contain all
harmoincs, so you only need on tone generator, and since I had a spare op
amp channel in #111, I added a tone generator to it. In the video I was
tweaking the tone and yo can hear a voice at bout 9 seconds &quot;right there&quot;,
guessing that&#x27;s between 600 and 800 hz. The idea behind the tone is to
supply a foundation sound &quot;they&quot; can use for voices. I wouldn&#x27;t try tones
only, too damn hard to listen to.
