<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>oops. I see it was Ursula who posted the &quot;r vs. r&quot; statement. And
Ursula your post is so much more eloquent and you&#x27;ve articulated the
point much better than I could. I&#x27;ll bow out of your way -Bill

&gt; Hi Robin,
&gt; Your phrase of &quot;ritualized vs. random&quot; is interesting. There are many
&gt; who believe that communication is between the conscious of the
&gt; researcher and the entity and the equipment is secondary. It&#x27;s easy to
&gt; get swept up in the technology and forget there is possibly a psychic
&gt; connection going on. With that said, focusing on equipment actually
&gt; can help the researcher become receptive to establishing a
&gt; communication link. While paying attention to the equipment, we forget
&gt; about the daily distractions and minor irritations that may prevent us
&gt; from establishing contact. 
&gt; 
&gt; The setting up the gear we use could be considered the first part of
&gt; the &quot;ritual&quot;. I like to clear my mind, set up equipment, mess with it
&gt; some more, then I am mentally prepare to begin what I hope will be a
&gt; successful session.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess &quot;random&quot; recording to me would be what happens in the field
&gt; during a paranormal investigation. I don&#x27;t bring Box technology into a
&gt; location with the intention of possibly contacting lingering spirits
&gt; at that location but I do bring audio recorders in hopes of recording
&gt; evp&#x27;s.
&gt; 
&gt; I find the Box works perhaps even better when I&#x27;m in a familiar place
&gt; like the room in my home that is designated for that purpose. I do
&gt; desire to have the finest Box technology that is possible but more
&gt; important is the association that seems to occur between the
&gt; researcher and the Box that is favored. Despite some of the benefits
&gt; of the new gear, the one that I seem to have a connection with is one
&gt; that requires a little more finesse to operate.  -Bill

&gt; &gt; Wow, thanks for your help guys!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ursula, your post was lovely.  I&#x27;ve been promising myself to learn 
&gt; &gt; more about Mark Macy&#x27;s work and will check out his website ASAP. 
&gt; &gt; Ritualized versus random recording makes sense to me now, as I want 
&gt; &gt; to accomplish true communication rather than continue being verbally 
&gt; &gt; abused. Have you given up &quot;ghost hunting&quot; altogether? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve been looking at the Olympus VN-4100 PC, Zack!  I don&#x27;t know if I 
&gt; &gt; need that much recording time, but I sure have liked the one I have 
&gt; &gt; and wouldn&#x27;t mind upgrading a bit.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi Frank! I basically follow your suggestion when recording, and once 
&gt; &gt; I learned to be quiet I actually started getting responses. I think 
&gt; &gt; the entities at my house got tired of playing with me though, and now 
&gt; &gt; they aren&#x27;t saying anything.  I kind of miss them, but I do feel it&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; time to move on.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Robin,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Radio Shack now carries the Olympus VN-4100PC at about the same 
&gt; &gt; price I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; paid for my VN-960PC a couple years ago.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with 
&gt; &gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 960. The 4100 has about 4 times the recording time, I think. That 
&gt; &gt; would 
&gt; &gt; &gt; make it about 24 hours.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m new to the group but probably know some of you from another
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; list.  I haven&#x27;t been too active in the realm of EVP recording
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recently, but have had what I consider excellent results in the 
&gt; &gt; past
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using my little refurbished Ebay-bargain Olympus VN-120 PC.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m anxious to start recording again and am feeling pretty
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overwhelmed by the technology you all seem to be using.  I know a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little about using good headphones and denoiser programs, but 
&gt; &gt; beyond
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I&#x27;m electronically challenged.  Still, I wonder if there are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simple techniques I can experiment with to increase my success.  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think I&#x27;m a little bored.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve felt pretty strongly that I&#x27;ve been communicating with a very
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; small number of entities, and I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s due to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limitations of my equipment. My most impressive EVPs have always 
&gt; &gt; been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; captured around my own home, particularly outside on the hill and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; near the barn.  I&#x27;ve gotten two inside my house (after inviting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been negative 
&gt; &gt; messages.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#x27;m thinking about getting another DVR and would love to 
&gt; &gt; hear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your thoughts and recommendations about which ones are best.  I 
&gt; &gt; would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like to communicate with more advanced entities eventually, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunately don&#x27;t have the brain for building anything myself.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
