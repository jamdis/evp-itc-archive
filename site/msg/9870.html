<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Margaret: Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t record, which in retrospect, wasn&#x27;t 
a very smart idea. I just wanted to run it, to see if it would even 
work. An issue that I noticed while doing this is that there is a lag 
time. When the program does recognize the allophones, it will show 
what it thinks was said and will wait for a &quot;sentence&quot; to finish. The 
problem with that is when doing that, Naturally speaking would erase 
some of what it thought was said if the allophones kept going. When I 
was listening, I think I recognized some things that the program 
didn&#x27;t type down. I&#x27;ll try to run a few more experiments later 
tonight when I get home from work.

LK: The session was probably maybe 10 minutes or so. The program 
didn&#x27;t type down everything, so I will try to tweak it some more, 
maybe by slowing down EVPMaker. I believe it became clear longer, 
because I slowed it down to 80% or so during the session. I will 
definately trying to adjust it some more and share the results again.

Stefan/Ron L.: That definately does sound like a good idea. I will 
see if I can try that. Maybe when I get home, I will see if I can 
copy and paste the text that is supposed to be read to the group. If 
I can, anybody that can help in synthesizing the allophones to read 
the text, that would be a great help. To do that you have to have 
Adobe Audition correct? Or is there anything else you can use/build?
