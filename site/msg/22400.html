<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I gave away my first Sangean radio that I used as a ghost box. Figuring I&#x27;d get another, I purchased another off of Amazon. After hacking it, I discovered the newer produced ones cannot be hacked. After the fact, I read it posted online too. Just received one I bought from Adorama taking my chances. Lucked out and found that it works! Figured a large company as Adorama, would purchase large lots of the items they sell. No telling how long the older radios will be available before getting to the news ones, but thought I&#x27;d put this out there. Keep that in mind if you want to purchase one here, a gamble when you do.
Haven&#x27;t been doing much with EVP in awhile because of hearing issues. Wanted to work with radio sweep since its real time and can avoid the editing required with recordings.</pre>
