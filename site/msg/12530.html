<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>OMGosh, that&#x27;s AWESOME, W.  Thanks for posting that info.  i was *just* wishing for that 
again yesterday, along with video capability from the camera.  The hacked phones have 
had both of these features for eons but I never had the nerve to start messing around with 
mine in that way.  I knew I was not technically savvy enough to fix it if something went 
wrong!  LOL.

&gt; I just found that there is now an Application for iPhone to record  
&gt; with. FINALLY! It&#x27;s called &quot;Recorder&quot;. I just bought it. A mere 99  
&gt; cents. If you have an iPhone, you can click on the App Store button  
&gt; (small blue button with a ruler, brush &amp; pencil in the shape of an &quot;A&quot;  
&gt; with a circle around it) and install it. To purchase it, it&#x27;s located  
&gt; it the &quot;Top 25 - Top Paid&quot; section.
&gt; 
&gt; You can record for minutes or hours and email recordings too. It was  
&gt; worth every cent. Can&#x27;t wait to play with this in other areas to see  
&gt; what I get.
