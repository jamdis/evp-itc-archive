&gt;  Well, it seems the original prediction of the east coast getting clobbered
&gt; is probably correct. Where I fell down was trying to ask questions and
&gt; getting BS doomsville junk. I knew it&#x27;s a mistake to ask questions, that
&gt; like opens the door for the dark dorks. I&#x27;m going back to just announcing
&gt; I&#x27;m doing an EVP recording, and just record. They know what I&#x27;m thinking and
&gt; what I need to know and who I would like to hear from. Asking questions, at
&gt; least for me, has always lead to problems. I&#x27;m not like others, presumming
&gt; I&#x27;m so smart and know what is talking, and if it&#x27;s honest, like most of the
&gt; box experts out there on the web. You know, the ones doing pod casts, radio
&gt; shows and proclaiming this that and the other thing.
