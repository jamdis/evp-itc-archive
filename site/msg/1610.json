More voices are in my folder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;There are so many different types of plastics with so many different\n&gt;characteristics ... ABS plastic, PVC, Delrin, acrylic, PTFE (teflon),\n&gt;Cyrolon ZX ...\n&gt;\n&gt;It might be interesting to experiment with different types and see what\n&gt;works the best.\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyone here ever build a Hieronymus machine?  I understand teflon (or\n&gt;fiberglass-teflon PC board material) works incredibly well for the\n&gt;&quot;stick&quot; sensor plate.\n&gt;\n&gt;Zack\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nhttp://newlivehotmail.com"}
