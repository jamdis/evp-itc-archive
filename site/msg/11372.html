Hi Angela!
welcome to the group! :)
I know what you mean about having kids =
running your whole life and no time for spook hunting... but what i do is p=
ut mine to bed and then off i go talking to spooks... i get PLENTY of activ=
ity in my home, so i dont think you need to go anyplace special to record e=
vps.... i used to go to cemetaries but i found i get just as many ( if not =
more) at home than i do there, plus the ppl at my house tend to know me, an=
d then ones in the boneyards dont...
good luck, and cant wait to hear some =
files!
:)
Charm

day) I'm looking forward to trying it =
out. I will post back with 
progress and results. 

Thanks!

 Welcome to the group =3D) Sounds like you have everything you need to 
get=
 started. My answer would be yes you pretty much have everything 
which is =
the recording device and the software on your pc to analyze 
your files.
