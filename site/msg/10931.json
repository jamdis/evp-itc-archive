Boy it sure feels good  this \nmorning.  And the first thing I do when I check my mail is check  my mail and \nlisten to your file.  I listen to all your files but I do not  always \nrespond.  I am always amazed at the communication you receive.\n \nI was especially impressed about these files.  They were very clear  and made \ncomplete sentences.  The second file in the zip just blew me out  of the \nwater.  Especially after listening to it over and over again I was  astounded.  I \nespecially liked the last word in the second file.  A  lot of us have received \nfiles with your name in it which is nothing new to any  of us.  But for you \nto receive a file with my name in it.  It is the  last word said in the second \nfile following the statements.  I just want to  thank you for putting that out \nthere so that I could hear it.other people have  gotten my name before but \nthat is only because they have asked direct questions  and my name has come up.  \nIn your file it was just stated.  And for  that I thank you.\n \nThank you again,\n \nJeff\n\n\n\n**************Wondering what&#39;s for Dinner Tonight?
