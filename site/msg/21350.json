You never know whose predictions are accurate and whose aren&#39;t and when, but when you get several people coming together predicting similar things that should be a warning... the psychic prediction registry website makes that possible.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Adriana Jones&quot; &lt;adrianamjones@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Since predictions seem to be popular on these boards I thought I&#39;d post this\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7QAZPb-IEQ&feature=related\n&gt; \n&gt; I found this video posted on www.prophecies.us\n&gt; Regular Joes and Janes post their  predictions there.  I&#39;ve followed this site a year and a half now, and they&#39;ve had some predictions that came true.  If you&#39;re into predictions, I highly recommend this site.\n&gt;"}
