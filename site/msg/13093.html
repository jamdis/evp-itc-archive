Yes and no Rick. The key word being the CONTEXT of the message(s) recieved.=

 I don't think anyone has conducted an independent study of which brands ar=

That sounds like an extremely importa=

If you have found that recorders are sensitive to som=
e radio
frequencies, and those recorders and those frequencies have not bee=

well tested or documented, then potentially some recorders are also
senst=

bring into s=

I own a Motorola Razor. On a recent investigation I had my Razor set
to vib=
rate. I recieved a phone call that set off the EMF detector and
it subseque=
ntly "spiked" from the color green to red and did so for
each vibra signal =
the the phone was receiving... This false positive
