Not sure why they sent me this yet. I sent it to a good friend and they heard what I did so I decided to go ahead and throw it out there. They said investigate real low...so I did. I looked into ULF/VLF frequencies. Learned a little bit but not sure what good it will do me at the moment. 
   
  They also mentioned this guys name and havent gotten around to researching him yet. I know little about him or his work.
   
  That session did cause me to try the music experiments in a way I hadnt before. So I chose a work that I have always enjoyed. Satriani does for guitars what Beethoven did for piano IMO. I had tryed beethoven before with minimal results but the guitar version of beethovens 5th had some great results LOL. Try some of it out for yourself and see what your results are. Maybe its just the right "time" for me to try it or maybe it will be sustainable...we shall see.
