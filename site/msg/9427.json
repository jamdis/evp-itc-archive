All (well, most) of the images on my site were done using my \nwater technique (link to instructions on lower left of page 2 of the site).  I do have a couple \nof crystal collages (also page 2, lower right - if you click on either image, a collage will \npop up).  I have gotten, as I recall, a dog in one of the crystal shots.\n\nSo far, I&#39;ve found that the citrine quartz works well if it has lots of lines in it (I don&#39;t know \nwhat the technical term is, occlusions?  Inclusions??) rather than being clear.  These seems \nto give them something to use to show themselves, if that makes sense.  I can actually \nwatch them appearing my view finder, but usually can&#39;t photograph what I&#39;m seeing.  \nMight try videoing the crystal like I do with my water technique to see if that helps.\n\nWith the water, I never see what is coming through until I go back and review the session, \none frame at a time.  Sometimes I get a whole lotta nothing, and other times I&#39;m totally \nblown away by the clarity of an image.  I hope some member here will try it.  :-)\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Margaret, were the animal captures photographs of a crystal?  \n&gt; Phenomenal images!

She loved animals like I do. She owned a Bakery and \n&gt; lived\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; across the street from me for years. The dog that my first \n&gt; wife and I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had at that time was a Scottish Terrier named Abbra (Her \n&gt; official name\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was Aberdeen, as in the Scottish town) anyway, I used to hear \n&gt; Jean\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking and I would look out the window and there she would \n&gt; be,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sneaking snacks to Miss Abbra who needed bakery snacks about \n&gt; like I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. LOL. Thats when we figured out why Miss Abbra wasn&#39;t \n&gt; losing weight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on her new diet.

I have some EVP of a woman talking \n&gt; to my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dog.  One time when I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was recording, my dog (Kindred) started barking.  When I \n&gt; listened\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back to the session (this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was tradition EVP done in silence with a digital recorder) \n&gt; she had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said, &quot;Kindred.  What was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that?&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In another, Kindred barks, then the woman says, &quot;Kindred.  \n&gt; She\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinks you&#39;re sleeping.&quot;  I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also have one of someone telling her &quot;NO&quot; and I really like \n&gt; the one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where someone tattles \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on her to me, &quot;Kindred&#39;s headed for the dumpster.&quot;  LOL.  \n&gt; Just goes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to show you they are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not only keeping an eye on us, but the animals too.  I \n&gt; think it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great that sometimes they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are talking directly to the dog.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I only have one involving my cat, Kizmyt, where someone \n&gt; says, &quot;Stay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back&quot; (the cat had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come into the room as I was recording).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have gotten many ITC images of animals, so clearly they \n&gt; are an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important part of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirit realm.  :-)  As well, I had animals come through \n&gt; during\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting with a medium.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for sharing about your Molly EVP!
