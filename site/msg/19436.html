<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Agreed, it is the best camera to get.  There are several models available:
some have built in IR lights, some have IR / UV lights, some are set-up for
sky watching, and others are just plain ol&#x27; full spectrum.

With this camera (depending on the model, a regular one with the different
options run around $120-150), you will also need the power supply ($12-$20),
a tripod, and a portable recorder.  My group uses 2 of them and each one is
attached to a portable DVD recorder that has a small LCD screen, you can
find these refurbished for under $100.
