<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>First off - don&#x27;t laugh.. some of us just were not born knowing how to
work with antennas and wires and freaking radios!  I have had poor
reception and I want to make it better.  I purchased the Radio Shack 
Amplified AM/FM Antenna (#15-1859) and a headphone adapter  (i hope
you call it that.. it allows you to connect to headphones..) and 2 y
adapters (1 w/2 male ends and 1 w/2 female ends)

I hook the whole thing up (see my picture in the Photos under Kristin)
and no sound!  Nothing Zip.. Zilch.

What am I doing wrong?  Do I need to open my hack up again and attach
an antenna or do I have to many adapters.... 

PS  I also purchased 50ft of 16 gauge wire.. now what?

LOL..  Anyone close to Austin who wants to help??!!
