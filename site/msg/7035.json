It got shipped \npriority mail.  Have fun with it.  I really like the way the FM scan \nrate is....\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I will be traveling to San Diego from Mexico to visit my sister and \npick up the RS 125 Mike is sending me.  I will be in the San Diego \nand El Centro area from Feb 15 to 19 and I would love to be able to \nmeet-up with someone from the area who has experience with EVP \ntechnology.  Mike is sending a box already hacked so we can work with \nthe box and hopefully get something recorded.  Since I have little \nexperience as a newbie to this, I would love to see how someone puts \nall of it together...recording, analyzing, etc.  \n&gt;    \n&gt;   If you have the time and are willing to give a little on-the-job \ntraining, please let me know by email.  By the way, in mid June I \nwill be traveling from Penn. to NC for two weeks and would love to \nget together with folks over in that area.  I will probably be \nordering a mini-box to be sent to my folks house in Allentown, so I \nwill have that to play with.  Let me know.
