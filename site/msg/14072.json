The\n&gt;&gt; fact is  most of the EVP evidence pretty much contradicts, or at least\n&gt;&gt; throws a monkey wrench in many so called scientific theories, and accepted\n&gt;&gt; dogma. Even spiritualists don&#39;t accept that there&#39;s a technology for spirit\n&gt;&gt; communication, who needs a medium when you&#39;ve got box?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  To me, it seems science has done little over the last 500 years except\n&gt;&gt; proclaim themsles the worlds only experts and source of all knowledge. All\n&gt;&gt; technological advancement is made by people trying an idea to see what\n&gt;&gt; works, and running with it, not waiting for peer review BS to tell her it\n&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t work.

The\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AAEVP/Sarah Estep Research Fund is not for AAEVP to do the research, it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for them to fund OUTSIDE organizations for THEIR scientific research on the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; study of EVP. The Windbridge Institute received some of this sponsor money\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for what they called &quot;Real-time EVP Conversations: A Pilot Study.&quot; The\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; method for this communication was *not* based on radio sweep, nor\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; traditional methods, so it&#39;s not based on what I assume many people here are\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doing. And in fact, it *was* based on the creations of someone outside of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the USA, so I&#39;m a little confused as to why all the hostility toward AAEVP\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for putting up the money.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sadly, radio sweep methods don&#39;t, and may not for a long time, get the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; respect of the scientific community that it deserves (then again, seems no\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; form of EVP does), but at least this current research is a step in the right\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; direction. I hope, when Windbridge concludes their study, that it will\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; support the notion that there is apparent communication formed in ways that\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cannot be explained by currently known and understood laws of nature. THAT\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alone, in my opinion, would be a big plus for all ITC communities,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regardless of the method from which that communication was received. What&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the old saying? &quot;It takes but one white crow to prove all crows are not\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; black.&quot; Any proof, derived from any EVP method, would be greatly welcomed as\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; far as I&#39;m concerned.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Margaret\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Frank\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; It&#39;s the same old stuff, everyone wants to completely ignore\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; absolutely all\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; work that has been in this field since the caveman and act like they\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; discovered spirit and EVP.
