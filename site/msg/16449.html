&gt;  I was lead to believe this person had an interset in the box, and she 
&gt; brought her &quot;boyfirend&quot; that just happen to be local, to our meeting 
&gt; the other day. I let them &quot;barrow&quot; #63, now  I&#x27;m sure she will claim 
&gt; she tested the box &quot;scientifically, and can prove it does not work.
