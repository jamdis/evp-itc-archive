Here\nis a blatant lie by Rick Moran in an obvious attempt to discredit him.\nThis is from the same article...\n\n&quot;There appears to be some controversy surrounding Frank&#39;s Box and\nChristopher Moon, who is the publisher of Haunted Times Magazine, a\nrelative of George and Cathy Lutz of Amityville infamy...\n\nFirstly, Christopher Moon is not now, nor will he ever be a close or\ndistant relative of the Lutz family. Mr. Moran lays claim to debunking\n the Amityville claims and says the entire &quot;case&quot; was a fraud. Now, he\nattempts to tie Christopher Moon to the supposed fraud. \n\nNow remember, this is the researcher you are supporting.\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;babiarz3&quot; &lt;babiarz3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; A few weeks ago I posted that Rick Moran had written an article\n&gt; stating that children and high school students would be part of the\n&gt; testing subjects of the mini-box. Later that day the article was\n&gt; replaced with a different article about the mini-box. I was told that\n&gt; I was stating mis truths. I wasn&#39;t. I finally was able to locate the\n&gt; missing article. I&#39;m providing a link to the entire article along with\n&gt; the statement regarding our children. If the link somehow becomes\n&gt; unavailable, I have done a screen shot and will provide it to whoever\n&gt; asks.\n&gt; Believe me when I say that this isn&#39;t to cause or stir crap. I was\n&gt; basically called a liar and this clears up that misconception. If I am\n&gt; banned from this group for telling the truth, than so be it. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;...it was not the question of whether the phenomenon existed to begin\n&gt; with, but rather what is the phenomenon.  That will require a good\n&gt; deal more effort to explore and beginning in January we will be\n&gt; undertaking test sessions all over north and east Texas as well as\n&gt; other national locations with a wide variety of folks to see what\n&gt; happens within the group dynamic.  The testing will include folks who\n&gt; are both believers and non-believers, skeptics, critics, other\n&gt; researchers, children, high school students, college and grad\n&gt; students, and senior citizens to name a few categories.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.asup-inc.org/pages/editorial11-29-07.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you willing to &quot;see what happens&quot; with our children?\n&gt;"}
