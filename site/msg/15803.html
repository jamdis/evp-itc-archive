Your very right Frank, there are those science types out there that think "=
If its not measurable then its not tangible". There are many more out there=
 that are not! When I write of cognitive abilities I try to show the differ=
ence between perceiving physical things of this level of reality and the pe=
rception of non-physical things. Most psychologists today do not see the mi=
nd as a purely physical thing but more or less the brain as an instrument t=
o experience the world in which=A0we presently live. The mind and conscious=
ness is still very much a mystery. I have been an advocate of the "paranorm=
al" for a very long time and I am studying to finish up my master in psycho=
logy. When I say psychologists aren't the hardcore, "only believe in whats =
physical types" it comes from a position of experience. There are whole fie=
lds of psychology dedicated to how the mind interacts with the non-physical=
 (dreams, visions, psi-phenomena, etc). Perceived reality is reality
 Frank=
!

The rules of these scientists depend on the scientist and how the resear=
ch is structured. Scienctific method is a very flexible thing and most psyc=
hological research is based on statistical data. If people want to change h=
ow this research is approached then people from our perspective need to get=
 involved! Correct?

I'm with you on your perception statements. I have exp=
erienced altered states that involved astral sight, OBE's and other things.=
 I have had experiences where I would be writing with a pencil on a piece o=
f paper only to "snap out of it" and realize it is really a mouse in my han=
d and I never noticed the transition to the pencil in the first place. 

Do=
n't feel like we are all still considered crack-pots, flakes or some other =
bullshit label because we experience the things we do. We are no longer vie=
wed like that, well at least not in the psychological field. Two of my frie=
nds and people who helped me a lot with my early research are well-known an=
d respected physicists and their histories include one heading up and runni=
ng the US governments remote viewing program that ended in the 90's and the=
 other was a senior researcher with PEAR at Princeton. They now research fa=
ster than light travel, warp drives, and wormholes for the US governement a=
nd NASA though they have their own institute. Point is we have friends in a=
ll fields of science!

Frank R.

I think the mind is not physical, and it's only=
 these paranoid scientist types that try to bully everyone into that extrem=
emly narrow thinking that everything experienced is physical phenomenon onl=
y, and must be made to fit into that context. 

Just because speech is all =
perception does not make invalid--that even normal speech is highly subject=
ive. If you used the rules of these scienctists, you couldn't even trust wh=
at the guy sitting next to you was saying. You couldn't trust what you were=
 hearing!

Perception is everything. How is it that just before some mass d=
eath thing, like a plane crash or some disaster I see the shadows shift, it=
 should not be possible, but never the less, I've seen it happen over and o=
ver. These scientific types brain wash everyone into not looking at clouds =
as you might imagine you see something--well a day or two before tornados i=
n other states I see circles in the clouds here-hundreds of miles away. Peo=
ple see me looking up and look at me like I'm insane because of these bully=
 skeptics. You're not allowed to perceive anything unless they tell you it'=
s ok. You can't look at clouds, and you can't listen to voices fragments, c=
uz they can't explain away the perceptions. These scientist types are too b=
rain dead to realize they too create thier reality-all those supposed new p=
articals did not exist before someone theorized about them, then they are c=
reated and "discovered" . 

Even it was all imagination, that does not make=
 it invalid or useless. It's still serves as personal insight.
