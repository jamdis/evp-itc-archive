<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>A couple of weeks ago, I had an amazing opportunity to spend some time
with Mark Macy. He&#x27;s an ITC researcher who has published several works
on the subject. He, along with my husband, Rosemary Ellen Guiley, and
I spent some time with the MiniBox and I have to tell you it was a
pretty incredible experience. Naturally, when I got home, I purchased
two of Macy&#x27;s books on ITC. The first was &#x27;Miracles in the Storm&#x27;, and
not far into it, I came across a couple of quotes I thought would be
fitting to share.

&#x27;...psychic channeling involves a blending of minds of the spirit
communicator and the human channel, as a result the message received
has been &quot;filtered&#x27; by the mind of the channel. Very rarely does a
message come through a human channel in a pure and unfiltered form.
With ITC, on the other hand, messages from spirit can come through the
equipment virtually unfiltered by the minds of the experimenters. So,
ITC provides a more reliable means of communication with the worlds of
spirit...&#x27;

If it is indeed possible to communicate with other realms through our
electronics, in my opinion, there would not be a need for exclusivity
in who could actually receive the communication. We all stand to
benefit greatly (and I am not speaking monetarily) if we can &#x27;bridge&#x27;
the gaps between our reality and whatever lies beyond it.

I have always been taught that there is &#x27;opposition in all things&#x27;.
For every positive, there is a negative and vice versa. We, as a
collective of like-minded researchers could make some pretty amazing
discoveries and share them for the greater good. We&#x27;ll have to take
the negatives in stride.

Sorry if it seems I am waxing philosophical... I just believe there is
a huge potential for growth here. Bravo to anyone is seeking out and
creating new ways of communication without immediately rejecting new
ideas.

Enlightenment is not meant for a select few. As human beings, we are
all entitled. Just my two cents...
