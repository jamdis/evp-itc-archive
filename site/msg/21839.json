Not gonna\njudge what &quot;they&quot; say, and not gonna get offended if it doesn&#39;t fit my world\nview( or lack of world view). They tell me earth is doomed, I don&#39;t care!  *Que\nSera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be).*\n**\n I don&#39;t know anything, and I don&#39;t wanna know anything. Everything started\nfrom nothing, so the only true reality is nothing. Meditate on nothing--be\nnothing! Nothing is everything, when you become nothing, you are everything,\nyou know everything.
