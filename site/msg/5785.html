I have had that radio on my night stand for years.  I listen to COast 
to Coast AM on it at night as I fall asleep and never tried the 
scan.  Figures...;)

&gt; I have always used this Sony Walkman the past several years to 
bring 
&gt; to the ball game with me and it&#x27;s by far the best sounding radio 
i&#x27;ve 
&gt; ever had.  Well, i was cleaning up today and came across it.  I 
&gt; turned it on and just held down the scan button and it scans 
through 
&gt; all the stations non-stop as long as you keep it pressed down.  
Which 
&gt; is no big deal since the recorded sessions for me are only usually 
10 
&gt; Min. tops. This model has been out for years and you can pick it up 
&gt; at your local Circuit city or Best buy, it&#x27;s even on Ebay for $20.  
&gt; Circuit city i think is like $30.  You have to plug headphones into 
&gt; it or an external speaker, but it fits in the palm of your hand and 
&gt; the reception is better than all the rest.  It runs off of 1 AAA 
&gt; battery and lasts forever.  For those who are afraid to hack a 
radio, 
&gt; just pick this model up and hold the scan button down and away you 
go 
&gt; right out of the packaging.  I did open it up and there is a 
ribbon, 
&gt; but nothing was clearly marked so i will have to find the 
schematics 
&gt; online before i mess with it.  The radio has AM/FM/WB/TV, however 
&gt; when i did the trial scans i found that the AM worked best and 
&gt; instantly received answers to my questions.  I turned it on and 
asked 
&gt; if this is working and loud and clear they said &quot;yes&quot;.  Oh, it&#x27;s 
&gt; model # SRF-M37V.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;ll post more when the ideas hit me.
