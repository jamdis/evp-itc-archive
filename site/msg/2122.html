<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>There was one image in each &#x27;movie&#x27; that was definitely a little 
strange, did you see those?

&gt;  The next step, tonight, set up a large TV (with video inputs) and 
record the screen while the VCR tuner is connected to cable. 
The &quot;guys&quot; wanted a hand mirror, so I was wondering if that&#x27;s used 
with the video, maybe record the TV reflection?  I have a large 
mirror, maybe 30 inches on a side that can be used. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Some VCR tuners have a module that is the tuner, with line level 
video and audio outputs(that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using), maybe something like 
that can be added to a Ghost Box, then the user supplies their own 
TV/video monitor---just a thought.
&gt;  
&gt;  It&#x27;s been longer than I thought since experimenting with video, 
the date on the &quot;video box&quot; is July 1, 2005.
