The majority of \n&gt; my experience comes from working with Chris (Moon) and his box for the past 3 \n&gt; years. The results still never cease to amaze me! \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyhow, I came across this device at an estate auction. It appears to be an \n&gt; antique communication device of some sort. The only verifiable information I \n&gt; have is that is was probably built around 1910-1912, which is before radio was \n&gt; publicly available. \n&gt; (I obtained this date from researching the packaging cylinder used to build the \n&gt; device.) \n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone have any thoughts on what it might be? I did show this device to \n&gt; Chris a while back and he agreed that it probably was a communication device. He \n&gt; also suggested I show it to Frank... = )\n&gt; According to Chris&#39;s box, &quot;this IS a communication device of historical value.&quot; \n&gt; It also mentioned the device was &quot;meant specifically for me to have, but no \n&gt; longer worked.&quot; There was more, but I&#39;m trying to remain unbiased and only \n&gt; use tangible evidence. However, I have little to go on.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone has any clues or can lead me in a research direction I would \n&gt; appreciate it! Thanks!\n&gt;"}
