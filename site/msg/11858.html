&gt; They&#x27;re awful. I had a run in a few years ago. They are more than pranksters. Damn awful. Clever too.

&gt; You&#x27;re not going to find any, I fear. This seems to be an entity collective who enjoy teasing EVP researchers. They caused a lot of annoyance to other researchers in the past, but nothing serious. Some seemed to be afraid of them, but I never really heard of them doing anymore than being annoying and prankish and sometimes, well, actually pretty damned funny on occasion.
