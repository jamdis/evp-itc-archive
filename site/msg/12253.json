I can hear those.\n\nMisty\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ourobouros2k2&quot; &lt;ourobouros2k2@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Posted a couple from my second session with .469 earlier this month. I\n&gt; thought that the session was a bust, but I finally got my recorder and\n&gt; .469 box back from my buddy and was reviewing that second session when\n&gt; I found the posted files. I was amazed how much I missed after\n&gt; listening to the recording. Enjoy.\n&gt;"}
