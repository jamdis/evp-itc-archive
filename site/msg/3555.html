<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I recently added a photo of an ITC image that was captured using the
video feedback loop mthod. This is where the cameras video out is
plugged into the tv&#x27;s video in. You then point the camera at the
screen. Look at the image in the viewfinder. They&#x27;re under Bill Murphy
pics.

&gt;  I think those are Misty&#x27;s pix. I did some experiments using a &quot;box&quot;
to scan a TV/VCR tuner, and got some interesting, but unverifiable
images, such as the MIB guy on the group home page. It would be
interesting if someone could figure out how make one of the little RS
portable TV&#x27;s scan.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Frank &amp; All group members,I&#x27;m new to the group and have been into
the paranormal investigations field for about 10 years now. I am
anxious to start ITC-EVP experimentation. I was looking over the
photos section. Can someone explain to me what they represent and how
and when the photos are taken. What is the procedure?Thanks much to
all!Rita
