  File        : /Frank&#x27;sJunk/042308-LookForLabels.jpg 
  Uploaded by : purplespacefriend &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; 
  Description : A power connector label on the bottom always helps to ID the power connections. You have to power on the radio to ID the tuner pins. This one was very unusal in that all the power/speaker connections were labled inside on the main board as well.
