I am  \nsitting here checking my email so i just thought i&#39;d turn it on  \nand... not check my email.  Anywho.... Then right at about 6:20 i  \nheard a voice say  &quot;Nicholas Etheridge please turn off the dsfnlsd&quot;   \nnot quite sure what word it used... possibly portal.  I just thought  \nit was weird.  Also under all of the jumble and this voice speaking i  \nheard a deep male voice almost chanting &quot;seven&quot;.  Not sure if I  \nactually heard this or its the want to have an excuse to stay home  \nand not take the HSAs.\n\nAnyway.. just curious if anyone has gotten heard this or if they know  \nsomething I don&#39;t about using the box in the morning.\n\nPeace,\nNick"}
