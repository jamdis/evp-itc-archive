That redish colored torn stuff is a circuit trace torn off the \nboard, it&#39;s green colored on top, and copper colored on the \nunderside. \n\n Those are surface mount connectors, and wires would have to be \nsoldered on the connector tabs, then spliced onto the board. I don&#39;t \nknow if I can solder anything that small with the iron I have. \n\n I hate advertise it, but I&#39;m in Littleton. \n\n Frank-S\n\n --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Debbie Tejada&quot; &lt;debbie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Okay, one of my DIY projects this weekend has been to convert my\n&gt; husband&#39;s old Olympus to infrared. We&#39;re not extremely talented in \nthe\n&gt; electronics area, but we have fun and seem to muddle by. No guts no\n&gt; glory, huh?\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, for the most part the operation has been a success. I\n&gt; photographed every step of the way and taped screws and parts to the\n&gt; photos so we&#39;d know how to rebuild everything we took apart, and \nthat\n&gt; has worked just fine. I located the IR filter, removed it and cut \nand\n&gt; replaced it with a piece of glass slide. \n&gt; \n&gt; The one problem we ran into is that there were two wires that \nappeared\n&gt; to be clipped in place as opposed to being soldered or screwed in \nlike\n&gt; everything else. When we tried to pry the clips open, instead the\n&gt; whole thing came off the circuit board. WE HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO \nPROCEED\n&gt; FROM HERE. I don&#39;t know if we can just glue the darn things down and\n&gt; if so, what type of glue to use, or if we&#39;re just plain up the \ncreek.\n&gt; \n&gt; I immediately thought of this group of brainy electronics buffs. I&#39;m\n&gt; hoping someone out there can give us some advice, or if you live \nnear\n&gt; Highlands Ranch, CO, you could help in person & bail us out of \nthis. I\n&gt; was hoping to take this camera to the St. Augustine Lighthouse at \nthe\n&gt; end of this coming week.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there any hope? I&#39;ve posted a photo of an extreme closeup of the\n&gt; clips (one is pink, the other is ivory) and the damaged board -- I \nhad\n&gt; to sandwich two photos together to get both in focus at the same \ntime\n&gt; (that&#39;s why it looks that way). For an idea of scale, the clips are\n&gt; both the same size, about 4 mm in width, 4 mm tall, 3 mm deep. Not\n&gt; easy to handle and even harder to see with these middle age eyes.\n&gt; http://www.tejadadesign.com/camera/splice.jpg\n&gt; \n&gt; Any advice would be GREATLY APPRECIATED!!  Deb T.\n&gt;"}
