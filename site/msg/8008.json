Its not very different from your hack.  I heard somewhere that you take a eye glass(little) screwdriver and poke it through the hole that the MU is next too.  My techs don&#39;t like the 125, and I&#39;m pretty sure that I didn&#39;t cut the wire next to the MU, but its possible that I might have trying to get some of the glue off the wire harness.   On a later date I might give it another try, but right now I&#39;m going to stick with what my techs like, and I get good results.  If might be good to go ahead and purchase the 125 before the stop selling those, just like the old 470&#39;s\n\nbruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:          william,\n \nI would assume that any other wire cut would affect some performance of the radio.\nAnd you know as luck would have it it probably was the wire connecting the antenna.\n \nI have amazing communication with the 125 and have had positive feedback from\neveryone else that has used it.\n \nSo I would say yes if you accidentally cut another wire it probably had to do with reception.\nIf you have the means, I would give the 125 another shot. \n \nBruce\n\n\n  Bruce Halliday \n\n\n\n\n    \n---------------------------------\n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nFrom: reesclarke_69@...\nDate: Wed, 19 Mar 2008 07:07:15 -0700\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] some new RS 20-125 files\n\n        Bruce\n   \n  I had the 20-125, and hack it with the instruction that you gave me.  I didn&#39;t get any results with that box as I told you before in the other group.  Of course I took it back and I stuck with my 469, because my tech didn&#39;t like the radio either.
