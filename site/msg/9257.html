I have posted three evpmaker speakjet files.  One has a message from Arthur and the two I can only speculate about.  
   
  These files were recorded by me during a 2 minute session.  I was NOT able to get the wording out of the recordings so I asked for Bruce's help.  In short order this is what he picked out.  To me they are pretty spectacular in length, content and clarity.  Thanks again Bruce...some day.  Ron L
