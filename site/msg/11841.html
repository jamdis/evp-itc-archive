&gt; First off, the Fish Group aren&#x27;t &quot;people&quot;. They are not and haven&#x27;t  
&gt; ever been human. I have no idea where you get this idea. &lt;&lt;





I said that because all of the examples I heard of EVP by the Fish  
Group has sounded very human and they have never claimed to have been  
other than human that I have heard. I have to base my conclusions on  
the EVP files, not speculation, even from the victims. Do you know of  
instances where they audibly claimed to be nonhuman? I may have  
missed them--I heard a lot of EVPs from them, but certainly not the  
sum total. (As I said--I even got one myself the other day.)

I think you&#x27;re right that they are definitely mobile, and a collective.
