Show me where Chris has said you &quot;only&quot;&gt;\n&gt; get false communication or bad guys. &gt; BTW I thought we were trying \nto\n&gt; get the negativity behind us and move&gt; on to constructive \ndiscussion.\n&gt; Guess that&#39;s more of the wishy-washy&gt; depends on what my hair feels\n&gt; like doing ways here. from his own blog (clipped, but not otherwise\n&gt; altered):&quot;Wednesday, November 28, 2007The Box has hit the fan!\nCurrent\n&gt; mood: distressed&quot;I have recentlybeen made aware that there are \nseveral\n&gt; replica versions of thisdevice being sold. I have also been told of\n&gt; another device that canbe purchased for very little from any\n&gt; electronics merchant andaltered by hand, producing what some \nconsider\n&gt; to be results. As Iexpected, the samples that people have sent me \nare\n&gt; *nothing morethan timed radio scans that have no validity.* \n[emphasis\n&gt; mine]&quot;These new &quot;radio scanners&quot; are not only *a waste of money*\n&gt; forpeople looking to do research with them in hopes of \nhavingeffective\n&gt; communication with the other side, but may in fact be \n*verydangerous*.\n&gt; Should demonic and other negative entities learn to usethese\n&gt; falsedevices, *the results could be devastating.*&quot;...The Catholic\n&gt; Church ... predicted the widespread sale of*false communication\n&gt; devices* as far back as last year. *I have recentlybegun to receive\n&gt; requests from individuals asking for help to closenegative doorways\n&gt; and portals that they believe they opened usingtheir purchased\n&gt; Telephone to the Dead replica*. Others are claiming&gt; that I am a \nfraud\n&gt; because their purchased device doesn&#39;t producethe positive results I\n&gt; have been fortunate enough to have.&quot;So let&#39;s go throug this\n&gt; again:*nothing more than timed radio scans that have no validity.**a\n&gt; waste of money**very dangerous**the results could be\n&gt; devastating.**false communication devices**I have recently begun to\n&gt; receive requests from individuals asking forhelp to close negative\n&gt; doorways and portals that they believe theyopened using their\n&gt; purchased Telephone to the Dead replica.*As you see, there are two\n&gt; statements that Chris is making--so much forhe&#39;s always consistant,\n&gt; which I believe was an earlier statement thatyou made.1. The new \nboxes\n&gt; create accidental timed radio scans only.2. The new boxes are very\n&gt; dangerous because they draw negative results.I&#39;m not sure how the \ntwo\n&gt; statements can stand together, but in eithercase, his opinion is\n&gt; clearly not complimentary toward the rest of thebox users besides \nthe\n&gt; four of the 30 he says, in the same post, &quot;havebeen \nidentified.&quot;Rather\n&gt; cheeky and insulting and wrong, HMO. But if he just goes ondoing\n&gt; sessions like the one APSR recorded, I will continue to laud \nthem.Ann \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Connect and share in new ways with Windows Live.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; http://www.windowslive.com/connect.html?\nocid=TXT_TAGLM_Wave2_newways_112007\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
