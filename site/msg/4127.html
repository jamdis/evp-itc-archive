<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>On the specs side, the MiniBox has controls for both scan rate as well
as sensitivity, so you can cut down on the amount of random noise and
also find a speed which seems clearer, whereas you cannot with the RS
Hack (as far as I know). The rechargeable battery lasts about 40-50
hours on one charge... nothing to replace that way. It has both a
speaker output and one for a recorder so you can not only hear it as
loud as you like, but you can directly record your session from the box.  

When it comes to audible differences, the quality of the electronics
used provides clearer sound. I am not straining so much to hear
things. It is just speculation on my part, but it seems to take less
time and less effort for communication from the other side to come
through with the Mini. At least, in my experiences with both devices.
Though, I have gotten snippets from the RS Hack that were impressive.
