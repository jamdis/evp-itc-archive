It&#39;s nice to meet you!  I turn the dial really fast back \nand forth .. (fast enough so that no words can be heard).  DC6 is a \nrecording program which allows you to hear the played-back version of \nwhat you&#39;re recording with about a 1/4 of a second delay. \n\nStephan .. It&#39;s nice to meet you also!!It wasn&#39;t actually &quot;LIVE&quot; .. I \nwas listening to them speak with headphones as DC6 was processing the \nfile. DC6 enables you to carry on an Evp conversation.  Hope I&#39;m \nexplaining this right .. It&#39;s not the radio speaking real-time.  \n\nThanks so much for listening!\n\nDebbie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Amazing - an actual live conversation! Thanks for sharing. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I recorded this sweeping manually and listening via DC6 &quot;LIVE&quot; ... \nHope \n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re able to hear it ..\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Debbie\n&gt;"}
