&gt; This experiment is intended for those interested in exploring the Remote
&gt; Viewing capabilities of their Ghost Box&#x27;s, EVP recorders. or even personal
&gt; clairvoyant or precognitive capabilities And to maybe even have a little fun
&gt; here.
&gt;
&gt; On Friday, 7/30/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer monitor,
&gt; right in front of me, and will leave it there until noon Denver time on
&gt; Monday, 8/2/2010. This experiment asks for participants to determine what
&gt; that object is. Vague or partial answers won&#x27;t be counted (for example, just
&gt; giving a color, shape, size, what it&#x27;s made of, etc): we&#x27;re looking for what
&gt; it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#x27;t count.
&gt; Participants can use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means
&gt; they chose. At the end of the experiment, I will reveal the object, and a
&gt; tally of the number of correct and/or incorrect answers.
&gt;
&gt; In order to keep me honest, I have taken a picture of the object at the
&gt; start of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of
&gt; this group. The idea with this file is that you can download it now and
&gt; &#x27;keep it safe&#x27; on your computer. Then at the end of the experiment, I will
&gt; post the password so you can reveal the contents of the file. That way, you
&gt; were in control of the original image during the entire test, not me.
&gt;
&gt; Password pdf:
&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100730.pdf
&gt;
&gt; And if you do not care to download the pdf file now, I will post the final
&gt; image there at the end of the experiment anyway.
&gt;
&gt; My monitor is one of the older box-like SONY CRTs, and says &quot;Trinitron&quot; and
&gt; &quot;Multiscan 200sf&quot; on the upper front. I have a couple monitors stacked in my
&gt; closet too: they are not the monitors used in this experiment (they are not
&gt; plugged in, and have nothing else on them anyway), and I have several
&gt; laptops around: they are also not the monitors in this experiment. The
&gt; monitor in this experiment is the only SONY monitor I have, says &quot;SONY in
&gt; various places on it, and can be seen in the following link from the first
&gt; experiment, when the correct answer would have been &quot;radio&quot;:
&gt;
&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG
&gt;
&gt; Please post all answers to the group thread: that way, there will be a
&gt; public record and I won&#x27;t get accused of losing any answers. Any answers
&gt; sent directly to me, I will repost on the public thread.
