<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes Frank there will always be some of those ego tripping people out there.
someone that just has to be better than most even if they have to fake it.
I can understand what you are feeling about these people but i hope you 
reconsider making the boxes.
even i was hoping some day to get one.Money is to tight  right now to 
even try to buy one.
please take in consideration the others out here that just do this to 
find out if there is really something out there for us to find.
those of us that will try anything in reason to find the truth .
if you stop making the boxes that will be one less thing we have to work 
with in finding the answers.
just my 2 cents..
Earl..</pre>
