Well I still dont knw what any of that has to do with me. I have stated cle=
arly everywhere what my boxes are and how they are made and that they are n=
ot the best on the market, I will not quarantee they will work(the radio pa=
rt) everything else in the box is waranteed. Mine are the cheapest out ther=
e. Thay are not the best looking out there. $50-$150 dollars worth of mater=
ials,parts or components and 2 weeks to build=C2=A0and then sell for=C2=A0$=
100-$250. The only one going in a hole is me, but Im going to build them an=
yway so I might as well get them out there. I add more options to it to mak=
e sure the person gets there money's worth as well as have equipment to inv=
estigate with. i have been reading about you today(I didnt know anything ab=
out until now other than you name) and I understand that you dont investiga=
te and it seems that you dont agree with it either, hard to say from what a=
ll I have read some s contradicting. This is my last pissing contest with
 =
you. Im done. It is what it is and frankly you scare me.
