Let me make sense of that! I was just video tapping my \nhusband \n&gt; with my phone cam, and realize the video looks distorted, so i \nwasnt \n&gt; goin to use it, i thought a moving picture would be more real for \n&gt; others to see. Being friends far the past i had come into connact \nto \n&gt; because of the great ole myspace were wondering why I didnt have a \n&gt; picture of him up. keep in mind the t.v. wasnt on, except for the \none \n&gt; he was playing a racing game on, and he turns the volume off of it, \n&gt; because it aint worth listening to if i am trying to watch my show, \n&gt; well i turned my t.v. off and went to video record him, and \nafterwards \n&gt; goin over it, i heard a very distinctive e.v.p. saying i love you.. \n&gt; nobody is talking, not even me, and you can hear it real well.. let \nme \n&gt; know how to send it and i will let the group see for themselves\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                          \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Never miss a thing.
