<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>We have done EVP work since the early 90&#x27;s and have never gotten a 
dark cursing EVP. The only thing I have gotten is a cursed word used 
describing someone and it just so happened that one night we were 
doing a white noise vs pink noise experiment and running late so we 
didn&#x27;t pray. So personally I believe it makes a difference, but it&#x27;s 
really up to the individual. Personally, I feel alike attracts alike. 
So staying positive and upbeat before hand and during probably really 
makes a difference no matter what.

We have also captured a good many apparition over the years via 
camera, and again prayer is done whenever we are going out on an 
investigation or paranormal shooting. The ones we have captured they 
always seem to be running or going a different direction than us, so 
again I feel it makes a difference. We have two Pagans on our team. 
One prays, and one doesn&#x27;t. The one that does is just starting out 
and has been getting some great shots and a few EVP&#x27;s. The one that 
doesn&#x27;t in 2 years has only gotten a few shots and no EVP&#x27;s......but 
I leave the choice up to each team member.

That&#x27;s my thoughts on it, it really boils down to personal 
preferences.

PS - I have started a discussion group for E.P.&#x27;s radio show. Is it 
OK if I post the link here? If not that&#x27;s OK too :)</pre>
