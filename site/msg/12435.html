Boxers).

&gt; In my eyes we are all Ghost Boxologists, and all equal.
&gt; That is why I coined the phrases:

&gt; Ghost Box-ology (Ghost Boxology) - The study of Ghost Boxes including
&gt; the art/science of design, test, instruction, and performance.
&gt;
&gt; Ghost Box-ologist (Ghost Boxologist) - One who practices the
&gt; art/science of Ghost Boxology.
&gt;
&gt; There is no right way, or wrong way... there are just ways.
&gt; Who knows what the spirits or entities like best?  I&#x27;m sure there are
&gt; a number of methods that work well for them, and us.. and we are
&gt; always attempting new ways. Some work and some don&#x27;t... or not at
&gt; first maybe.
&gt;
&gt; Frank&#x27;s Box, the Radio Shack Hack(s), the Mini Box, Joe&#x27;s Box, etc.
&gt; are all methods that use sweeping audio.  And others are coming up
&gt; with new ideas all the time.
&gt; The Ovilus and Puck for example.  Even though Bill Chappell says
&gt; those methods are just for entertainment, I&#x27;m sure there will be
&gt; times when things happen when using those devices that make one
&gt; wonder.
&gt; (Note: I don&#x27;t have a Frank&#x27;s Box, Mini Box, or Joe&#x27;s Box, but I hear
&gt; they all work well.)
&gt;
&gt; It&#x27;s really great to have people (Ghost Boxologists) that are willing
&gt; to share their information and ideas.  Recently I&#x27;ve read some posts
&gt; about another method using a chamber, switch, etc. for an audio type
&gt; device.  That&#x27;s awesome that there is still a desire to try new stuff.
&gt;
&gt; I too am working on something new, right now in the test phase, and
&gt; I&#x27;ll be sharing that in the near (or far) future.
&gt; I&#x27;m also going to attempt to &#x27;crack&#x27; that other radio again, even
&gt; though it might not be possible.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks to all who keep this Ghost Boxology effort going!
