<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Guy,

Thanks!  I went to school here at the U of Ill and ended up staying in 
town.  I work as an engineer/geophysicist for a small engineering firm. 
I got my BSEE in 1974 and MSEE in 1977. I guess that dates me even more!

I grew up in the Joliet area, which is a couple hours to the north.  I&#x27;m 
connected with several paranormal groups including the Will County group 
(Joliet area) and some in central Illinois.

I played around with EVPMaker a little.  Just wish I had more time ...

Zack

&gt; Hi, Zack.
&gt;
&gt; I have my BSEE from U of I in your neck of the woods! Yep...I&#x27;ve
&gt; lived on campus in both Urbana and Champaign. It&#x27;s been years since
&gt; I&#x27;ve been back (actually - not since I graduated in
&gt; 1980...lol...THAT dates me!). I&#x27;ve studied on and off for both my
&gt; commercial radio license and ham license but just never followed
&gt; through on getting them - too many other things going on.
&gt;
&gt; By the way - I was born and raised in Moline (the Quad Cities) but
&gt; now I&#x27;m thoroughly &quot;embedded&quot; here in Southern California...no more
&gt; ice and freezing cold and snow for me!
&gt;
&gt; Have you downloaded and tried Stefan Bion&#x27;s EVPMaker yet? As you
&gt; know from reading Frank&#x27;s documentation - that&#x27;s what he based
&gt; the &quot;Ghost Box&quot; on...
&gt;
&gt; Anyhow - welcome!
&gt;
&gt; Guy
