&gt; *First one says, &quot;guess who loves you&quot; the second one is my mom, saying,
&gt; &quot;Shawnie Poo, and then a man says, &quot;bonnie, your mother.&quot;  David told me the
&gt; reason it&#x27;s so hard to hear some of the spirits is because they are on a
&gt; higher level, and farther away, btw, this is my mother&#x27;s voice, but it is
&gt; hard to hear her.  Shawnie poo is my son, she always liked to call him
&gt; Shawnie poo ever since he was little.  Take my word for it, this stuff is
&gt; the real thing! sf*
