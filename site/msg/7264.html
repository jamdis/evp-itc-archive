<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ryan,
Thanks for returning Dave&#x27;s call today. Your message was communicated
to Frank and he realizes that it wasn&#x27;t the intention of A&amp;E to
deliberately post inaccurate info and that PRS is separate from the
network. I believe he considers the issue to be closed.  Regards, Bill

&gt; Thanks for bringing this to our attention. I wasn&#x27;t even aware that 
&gt; this episode was airing next week. You all have to understand that A&amp;E 
&gt; and PRS are TWO SEPARATE entities. We do everything in our power to 
&gt; maintain accuracy. This has been brought to my attention from someone 
&gt; else and I am awaiting Mr. Sumption to contact me.
