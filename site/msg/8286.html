<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Mike,

I haven&#x27;t done that personally, because i don&#x27;t think that the 
communication is at the point to receive full sentences.  You get a 
couple words here and there that we can piece together to make 
somewhat of a sentence, but i don&#x27;t believe anybody has reached that 
stage yet.  If i got a full sentence that would be great, but it 
probably wouldn&#x27;t be clear enough to post on the board.  If i have to 
explain what it says to convince people to hear it, than it&#x27; s 
probably nothing.  When in doubt, throw the file out.  I try to form 
the questions for the most part in Yes and No format, it seems they 
can always respond with yes and no.  I do get other stuff that is 
good, but i try and keep it simple for them.  And frank just sits 
back and listens without asking questions allowing them to get that 
message across.  I prefer to ask questions, because i know when to 
wait for a response.  The Skype session i had with my Joe&#x27;s box last 
friday with Juli and Joel was a great example of getting good 
communication.  We were getting answers to all our questions and 
that &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; file was one of the clearest i have ever heard 
come through my Joe&#x27;s Box #2, which is now broken again.  Juli has 
all the audio and will post more as she goes through it for everybody 
to hear.

&gt; Hi Steve, hope all is well with you.
&gt;    
&gt;   From this site it appears that yourself, Frank, Bruce, and 
Kristin and others I can not think of at the moment, have been 
engaged in contact as such that you ask a question and they give an 
answer. Have any of you ever taken the info you receive from lets say 
one spirit and tried to contact their living relative to give them a 
copy of the recording? Have spirits asked you more experienced 
researchers to do that, and if so, was the person you contacted 
indeed the correct loved one, and what was their response in you 
contacting them?  I think this would be awesome to be able to serve 
as a messenger to the deceased
