This is wrong. Skepticism is a \nprovisional approach to claims. It is the application of reason to \nany and all ideas  no sacred cows allowed. In other words, \nskepticism is a method, not a position. Ideally, skeptics do not go \ninto an investigation closed to the possibility that a phenomenon \nmight be real or that a claim might be true. When we say we \nare &quot;skeptical,&quot; we mean that we must see compelling evidence before \nwe believe...&quot;\n\n(http://www.skeptic.com/about_us/discover_skepticism.html)\n\nIn this regard - I consider myself a skeptic...one who practices/uses \nskepticism. Note that this concept cuts both ways. For example - some \nEVP is explained away as &quot;apophenia&quot;. When you really dig into that \nterm - you find that it is used inappropriately.\n\nI&#39;ve started calling people like James Randi, etc. &quot;discreditors&quot;. \nNot only do they NOT believe in various abilities/stories/etc. (at \nleast publicly) but they ACTIVELY ridicule the people and their work \nwhom they disagree with and attempt to rally others to this cause.\n\nGuy\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Guy&quot; &lt;yzzzguy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; By the way - CSICOP (the Committee for the Scientific Investigation \n&gt; of Claims Of the Paranormal) changed their name in late 2006 to \n&gt; CSI...the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://csicop.org/specialarticles/csicop.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Guy\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robin Searcy Henson&quot; \n&gt; &lt;MudPuddleFarm@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is great Frank.
