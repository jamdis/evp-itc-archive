I=\r\n made good on my escape, LOL.  If everyone will bear with me I think I reca=\r\nll the files, involved.  This happened just a little over a year ago, and I=\r\n think I still have the files.  When I find them I will let you know the fi=\r\nle types and the destination and origin of the files.  I had a computer cra=\r\nsh since that time and I will have to back to backup files to extract and r=\r\nestore the files. I think that I got a copy of the file that our member had=\r\n that was a total loss as a copy, with the data loss.  The data loss was gr=\r\neat enough that the file did not come close to the original.  I got in my c=\r\nar and drove over to my team members home to listen to the file I ad sent h=\r\nim by e-mail through Yahoo I believe. I &#39;ll verify that too.\n\n  I will try =\r\nto get you guys the information on the files by tomorrow night.  I hope eve=\r\nryone had a great weekend.\n\n\n  Regards,\n  Jon in Texas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n  From: =\r\nApril Abercrombie &lt;april@...&gt;\n  To: EVP-ITC@yahoog=\r\nroups.com\n  Sent: Sunday, May 10, 2009 3:50:03 PM\n  Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] =\r\nFile uploading rules-ATTENTION JON\n\n\n\n  I have not personally experienced t=\r\nhe loss myself.

However, for wav files, the c=\r\nompression during email is not loss less. \n\n            I used to think as =\r\nyou do, in that the emailed attachment of a wav file would not loose anythi=\r\nng. After a lengthy discourse with another member here, I learned that I wa=\r\ns wrong. The reason why I did not realize it in the first place is that whe=\r\nn I would email a wav file, I would intentionally keep it in very small seg=\r\nments, to keep file size down. This was just for ease of transfer. But beca=\r\nuse of this, I had not experienced any noticeable loss.\n\n            Now it=\r\n may be in some cases, depending on the servers or what have you that the f=\r\nile goes through, that the loss may be less or more. But once the attachmen=\r\nt is downloaded, the quality has been found to be less then the original wa=\r\nv.\n\n            Again though you can only really tell when the wav file is =\r\nlarge.\n\n            ----- Original Message ----- \n              From: Rj \n =\r\n             To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com \n              Sent: Sunday, May =\r\n10, 2009 1:36 PM\n              Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n=\r\n\n\n                    The kind of compression that occurs during an email a=\r\nttachment is &quot;lossless&quot;: it compress the file cleverly without losing infor=\r\nmation.  For example, if I had a program in some .exe files, and I sent it =\r\nover email, it could compress it.  But if it lost even one bit, the resulti=\r\nng exe file would not execute again after it was uncompressed on the other =\r\nside.\n\n                    This kind of compression does things like lookin=\r\ng for common patterns in the file, and replacing them with a token.  A roug=\r\nh example would be if it found &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot; in a file 20 times, it coul=\r\nd replace all the occurances with say $HN1.  And also write a little dictio=\r\nnary in there someplace that says &quot;$HN1=3DHowdy Neighbor&quot;.\n\n               =\r\n     When the file gets to its destination it can be uncompressed, and all =\r\noccurences of $HN1 are replaced with &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot;.  So it was compresse=\r\nd (instead of 14 characters each, it only needed 4, plus the dictionary), b=\r\nut lost no data.\n\n                    Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are =\r\nnot lossless.  Depending on the level of compression, some level of data is=\r\n lost, and so cannot be recovered or reconstructed later.\n\n                =\r\n    Rick\n\n\n\n                    --- On Sun, 5/10/09, April Abercrombie &lt;apr=\r\nil@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n                      From: Apr=\r\nil Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt;\n                     =\r\n Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n                      To: EVP-=\r\nITC@yahoogroups .com\n                      Date: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 10:2=\r\n6 AM\n\n\n\n                      Another thing:\n\n                      I recen=\r\ntly found this out. When you email a file, if it is not saved as a compress=\r\ned format, the email filtering process will actually compress the file auto=\r\nmatically.\n\n                      So even if you have attached a wav. file,=\r\n it will loose resolution over the email process. It will not sound exactly=\r\n the same as the original wav. file. How much it differs depends on the siz=\r\ne of the file you are attaching. If it is a very large file, it will sound =\r\nmuch different.\n\n                      The only exception to this is if the=\r\n wav. file is small enough that the filtering process will ignore it. It ha=\r\ns to be pretty small though, like under 1 MB (I am not exactly sure of the =\r\nthreshold).\n\n                      The best way to share files over the int=\r\nernet if you want them as close to the original as possible is to upload th=\r\nem directly to a website.\n\n                        ----- Original Message -=\r\n---- \n                        From: Rj \n                        To: EVP-ITC=\r\n@yahoogroups .com \n                        Sent: Sunday, May 10, 2009 10:54=\r\n AM\n                        Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n\n\n\n=\r\n                              Pixelization doesn&#39;t clean-up the data: it re=\r\nplaces it.  Imagine taking a picture of a field of flowers, and beginning t=\r\no add levels or pixelization to the picture.  Soon, you would not be able t=\r\no tell there were flowers there at all.  You would see a lot of colored blo=\r\ncks.\n\n                              Or in the other direction, imagine you =\r\nare looking at a competely randomize bunch of pixes on your screen: a compl=\r\nete screen of truely random static snow.  Pixelizing this, after a while, y=\r\nou would again start to see colored blocks.\n\n                              =\r\nWhat&#39;s happening is that it is processing an area of the image, taking (for=\r\n instance) the average value of that entire area, and replacing all the blo=\r\ncks in that area with the average.  In video processing, this would result =\r\nin a field of multi-colored flowers being replaced by, for instance, a big =\r\ngreyish-bluish block, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the noise example=\r\n, it maybe replace all the random pixels with another big greyish-bluish bl=\r\nock.  If you did not know beforehand what the original picture was, you cou=\r\nldn&#39;t tell whether your pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a ch=\r\nevy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.\n\n                   =\r\n           It works the same with the sound files.  Taking something as com=\r\nplex as speech, and replacing frequencies with their averages, loses the sp=\r\neech the farther you go, until you head strange fluctuating square waves.  =\r\nDoing the same to random static will eventually produce the same thing.  An=\r\nd random fluctuating square waves can sound a bit like speech - or at least=\r\n, you could have fun sharing with each other what you thing they &#39;sound lik=\r\ne&#39;.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              --- On Sun, 5/10/09, Misty Dawn &lt;bul=\r\nletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n                                From: Misty D=\r\nawn &lt;bulletbabea@ yahoo.com&gt;\n                                Subject: Re: [=\r\nEVP-ITC] File uploading rules\n                                To: EVP-ITC@y=\r\nahoogroups .com\n                                Date: Sunday, May 10, 2009,=\r\n 9:29 AM\n\n\n                                I always save the whole file in =\r\nwav format then do my clips as mp3.

Th=\r\ne reason why&nbsp;I did not realize it \n            in the first place is t=\r\nhat when I would email a wav file, I would \n            intentionally keep =\r\nit in very small segments, to keep file size \n            down. This was ju=\r\nst for ease of transfer.

A rough \n                    example would be if it found &quot;Howdy Neighbor=\r\n&quot; in a file 20 \n                    times, it could replace all the occuran=\r\nces with say \n                    $HN1.&nbsp; And also write a little dicti=\r\nonary in there \n                    someplace that says &quot;$HN1=3DHowdy Neigh=\r\nbor&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When the \n                    file gets to its destination it =\r\ncan be uncompressed, and all \n                    occurences of $HN1 are re=\r\nplaced with &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot;.&nbsp; \n                    So it was compress=\r\ned (instead of 14 characters each, it only \n                    needed 4, p=\r\nlus the dictionary), but lost no \n                    data.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some for=\r\nmats, like jpeg and mp3. are not \n                    lossless.&nbsp; Depen=\r\nding on the level of compression, some \n                    level of data i=\r\ns lost, and so cannot be recovered or \n                    reconstructed la=\r\nter.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rick&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On \n                    &lt;B&gt;Sun, 5/10/09=\r\n, April Abercrombie \n                    &lt;I&gt;&lt;april@abercrombiegh ostrese=\r\narch. com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;

When you email a file, i=\r\nf it is not saved as a \n                      compressed format, the email =\r\nfiltering process will \n                      actually compress the file au=\r\ntomatically.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3D=\r\n&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 =\r\nface=3D&quot;Myriad Pro&quot;&gt;So even if you have \n                      attached a w=\r\nav. file, it will loose resolution over the \n                      email pr=\r\nocess.
