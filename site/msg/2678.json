You can hear a lot of shuffling around \nand natural man-made noises in the background.  I would never knock \nanybody else&#39;s research, but i&#39;ve heard a lot of Evp and these don&#39;t \nseem to be Evp&#39;s.  Even bad evp&#39;s are barely audible and can say \nseveral different things depending on the listener.  If you want bruce \nand i could send you some real Evp&#39;s done with a simple recorder so \nyou know what to listen for.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; hey Dave,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sorry but I do not hear anything in those files.\n&gt; are you new to evp ? if so let me know and I will help get you on \nthe \n&gt; right track.\n&gt; \n&gt; e-mail me paranormalinvestigating@...\n&gt; \n&gt; bruce\n&gt;"}
