I have had one for a while now, and let me be the first to say that it works.  I have had numerous two way conversations using it, as well as captured video evidence of these conversations showing that there is nothing around capable of giving off an EMF.  The only issue that I have concern with is unlike EVP work or video ITC work you have no recognizable voice or image to positively correlate who the communication is coming from.  In my case, I might ask the question &quot;Are you Sylvia, my mother, show me two spikes for yes and one spike for no&quot; and the meter will spike twice for yes, but I have no voice or image I would recognize to verify that is who is causing the meter to spike.  The meter is a very useful tool and I do not conduct an investigation or session without it by my side, but like the rest of the tools in this field it has its valuable points as well as negative points. \n   \n  Lynn \n\nFrank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n          \nI saw on Ghost Hunters last night that they were using a &quot;K2 Meter&quot; to get yes-no answers from the unseen.
