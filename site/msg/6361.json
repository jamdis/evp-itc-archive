The only editing has been normalizing the audio to 60db \nand trimming it out of the original recording.\n\nThis week I am switching to direct recording from a single 12-470 box \nwith an amplified mic for my voice, and headphones to monitor the \naudio coming out of the radio and into the recorder.  I will post my \nresults accordingly, as I am working to try and get clearer responses \nwithout much clean-up.  \n\nMy first response within seconds after hooking it all up as described \nwas &quot;Better, Chuck.&quot;  I think when the recorder has to pick up the \nsounds from a speaker, it adds much more noise that may not need to \nbe there. ;)\n\n- LC\nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The random mode on this box never worked, which i feel is a great \n&gt; feature.  I changed the antenna with a piece of 20 guage wire from \nwork \n&gt; and now the random seems to work really well, i really don&#39;t \nunderstand \n&gt; why.  This was my first session with the random on #27, let me know \n&gt; what you guys think.  I left it as raw of files i could.  There is \na \n&gt; couple up for interpretation that i&#39;m not really sure of and \nanother \n&gt; that says &quot;He wants to see if it&#39;s working&quot;.  I hear &quot;He wants to \nsee&quot; \n&gt; very clearly and i personally hear &quot;if it&#39;s working&quot;, but that may \njust \n&gt; be my mind wanting to hear that.  I&#39;m only 2 min. in to this \nrecording \n&gt; from this morning, but i have to get to work so i will post what \ni&#39;ve \n&gt; got so far.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
