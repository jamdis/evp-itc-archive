The kind of compression that occurs during an email attachment is "lossless=
": it compress the file cleverly without losing information.=A0 For example=
, if I had a program in some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it could=
 compress it.=A0 But if it lost even one bit, the resulting exe file would =
not execute again after it was uncompressed on the other side.

This kind o=
f compression does things like looking for common patterns in the file, and=
 replacing them with a token.=A0 A rough example would be if it found "Howd=
y Neighbor" in a file 20 times, it could replace all the occurances with sa=
y $HN1.=A0 And also write a little dictionary in there someplace that says =
"$HN1=3DHowdy Neighbor".

When the file gets to its destination it can be u=
ncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are replaced with "Howdy Neighbor".=
=A0 So it was compressed (instead of 14 characters each, it only needed 4, =
plus the dictionary), but lost no data.

Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. a=
re not lossless.=A0 Depending on the level of compression, some level of da=
ta is lost, and so cannot be recovered or reconstructed later.

Another thing:
=A0
I recently found this out. When you email a 
=
file, if it is not saved as a compressed format, the email filtering proces=
s 
will actually compress the file automatically.
=A0
So even if you have a=
ttached a wav. file, it 
will loose resolution over the email process. It w=
ill not sound exactly the same 
as the original wav. file. How much it diff=
ers depends on the size of the file 
you are attaching. If it is a very=A0l=
arge file, it will sound much 
different.
=A0
The only exception to this is=
 if the wav. 
file is small enough that the filtering process will ignore i=
t. It has to be 
pretty small though, like under 1=A0MB (I am not exactly s=
ure of the 
threshold).
=A0
The best way to share files over the 
internet=
=A0if you want them as close to the original as possible is to upload 
them=
 directly to a website.

Pixelization doesn't clean-up the data: it replaces

    =
    whether your pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a chevy, th=

        sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.

It works the same=
