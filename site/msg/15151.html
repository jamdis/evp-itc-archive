<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Interesting topic!

BTW that investigation was at the former Manteno State Mental Hospital. It
included the amazing &quot;It&#x27;s Harold Wing&quot; EVP I got. None of the people doing
the investigation there had ever heard of Harold Wing. Upon later
examination of old records, it was found that Harold Wing was actually a
patient who died there of typhoid fever in 1938. But we didn&#x27;t find that out
until weeks later.
How do you explain that conventionally?

&gt;
&gt;  There&#x27;s another possibility: possibly the spirits involved only wish to
&gt; impart sounds to a particular unit or units.
&gt;
&gt; I was surprised on one investigation I was on to get mostly all the same
&gt; EVP on my DVR, which was hanging from my belt, and my camcorder, which was
&gt; in front of my face. Other people on the investigation didn&#x27;t get them at
&gt; all. Go figure!

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   There could be several reasons, and it&#x27;s only conjecture without
&gt;&gt; comparing the two specific units in questions.  But some ideas:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1) The battery level on one is different than the other, and causing one
&gt;&gt; to function less optimally and introduce noise or artifacts into the stream.
&gt;&gt; 2) They were not actually &#x27;sitting&#x27; side by side, but being swung around.
&gt;&gt; 3) They are pointed at different areas
&gt;&gt; 4) One may be older than the other or have been dropped a few times.
&gt;&gt; 5) One may have been recently exposed to extreme humidity or temperatures,
&gt;&gt; while the other remained in a comfortable environment, before doing this
&gt;&gt; recording
&gt;&gt; 6) One may be sitting in a position more subject by airflow or vibrations
&gt;&gt; 7) They may use different memory cards. that have different error or
&gt;&gt; accuracy profiles
&gt;&gt; 8) The final sound files may have been processed differently in various
&gt;&gt; software programs
&gt;&gt; 9) People in the room may be nearer and moving closer to one than the
&gt;&gt; other
&gt;&gt; 10) They may simply be two different models with different recording
&gt;&gt; sensitives and limitations

&gt;&gt;  Hi,
&gt;&gt; I believe I saw an explaination on this list about why if you have 2
&gt;&gt; recorders sitting side by side, why may one capture an EVP on one and not
&gt;&gt; the other? Someone was explaining about an energy field like a bubble.
&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m trying to explain this theory to a friend. Can someone help me?
&gt;&gt; Thanks Laura
