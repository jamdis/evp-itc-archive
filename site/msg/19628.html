<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>No, I don&#x27;t think I am being too critical, but I may have expectations that
are a little too high.  I want to take my time with this.  For my own
understanding, I need to have a large sample size so I know not only what to
expect to see, but what to look for.  I have seen ITC snapshots from
programs like this that offer full faces.  I would be more inclined to
believe in such an image as opposed to, lets say. two dark lines that may or
may not be eyebrows.

Even in your example of the towel, you get half a face.  If you have half a
face (on the vertical plane, not the horizontal) you can extrapolate out
what the entire face would look like.  This is something I would like to get
myself and I would consider that evidence if it showed up in one of these
programs.  But, if you have something that looks like a forehead and that is
all there is, then it could also look like a rock or some other such object.

I am certainly hoping for results worked into box sessions.  Directing a
session with intent, like saying &quot;I am going to examine the sound waves of
this communication in hopes of seeing your face.  Is it possible you can
show your face to me now through sound? &quot; is what I am after.  If a positive
hit like this happens, then I will be jumping for joy.  Another good example
would be a name, lets say Tom, that occurs.  If you get a positive
affirmation that the name you heard is present, then you try the same
technique only you address Tom by name and get a face, that would be even
better.

But, as it stands now, the faces as they appear are random at best.  I would
be more inclined to believe that when these faces do occur , they are going
to occur with a lesser frequency than multiple images in a few seconds of
audio like Ursula&#x27;s example.  If this where the case, there would be dozens,
and possibly hundreds, of faces during a ten minute session and I just don&#x27;t
think that is possible.  This is why I need to look at several samples to
find out if this is the case or not.  If these partialized faces occur in
multiples all the time, I would be more apt to discount it.  But, if they
are a rarity affixed to only a few clips out of dozens, I would be more
inclined to believe in them.  Sample size is everything.  It is like
listening to GBC.  If you have never done a session before, you would be
inclined to believe every stray radio signal is a communication.  Only by
continued practice (expanding your sample size) can you start to rule out
stray radio with any degree of accuracy.

On the other hand, I am very new to this and I could certainly be wrong.  I
will continue to plug sound into the programs and hope for the best.

I really want this to work.  As you have probably experienced, when they
want you to hear something or know something, they make it very obvious
while communicating.  I am hoping they apply this same rigor to this new
format to show us that they are there.  If they can, then the world of video
and audio ITC will merge in one source and then the skeptics be damned!

&gt;  I think it&#x27;s unrealistic to expect every file to have faces and images.
&gt; These faces are often just portions, eyes and lips, some have eye brows.
&gt; Like all of this, not done for proof, it&#x27;s for emotional impact.  I have
&gt; this woman that shows up in towels, always just half the face. Perahps you
&gt; are being too critical? As with all spirit messages, it&#x27;s what it means to
&gt; the experiencer that matters. Expecting full faces is like expecting the
&gt; kings english and proper grammer in all EVPs.

&gt;&gt; I saw a couple which could be construed as images in the one series you
&gt;&gt; had from SEA, but nothing that knocked me over the head yet.  I am going to
&gt;&gt; have to see a larger sample size before I determine if what you have
&gt;&gt; witnessed is in fact a form or not.  I cannot accept an image as paranormal
&gt;&gt; without knowing where it sits among the bulk of audio files.  If every file
&gt;&gt; has multiple faces, the I would have  to say that there is nothing there.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So, I will certainly keep testing with my copy and hopefully something
&gt;&gt; will really pop for me.  I have run through about ten files (EVP and GBC) so
&gt;&gt; far for intensive study and I still haven&#x27;t got anything that I would
&gt;&gt; consider a positive hit.  I need an actual formed face, not portions
&gt;&gt; thereof, to consider an image real.  This is the only way to discount visual
&gt;&gt; matrixing.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have high hopes for this though!

&gt;&gt;&gt;  I&#x27;ve seen live webcast of ITC sessions where GB output is fed directly
&gt;&gt;&gt; into the mic line in on a computer running Adobe Audition with the
&gt;&gt;&gt; spectragraph running. It was really compelling to see letters and numbers,
&gt;&gt;&gt; not images or pictures, but partial words appear in the graph. At first it
&gt;&gt;&gt; was I thought it was a software glitch but it is a repeatable event. It was
&gt;&gt;&gt; on LiveSciFi which is run by Tim Wood, he also thought there was some kind
&gt;&gt;&gt; of code error but it happened on more than one webcast.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; So if anyone has Audition, just feed Box output right in your computer
&gt;&gt;&gt; and see what happens. I wanted to try it tonight but I have Audacity and the
&gt;&gt;&gt; spectragraph feature doesn&#x27;t have that shaded appearance that Audition does
&gt;&gt;&gt; so it&#x27;s not able to render images or characters, at least as far as I see
&gt;&gt;&gt; using the various settings.
