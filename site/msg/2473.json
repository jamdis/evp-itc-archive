Being t=\r\naken over by aliens is not exactly what we are looking forward to. \nCertain=\r\n parasites can change the behavior of their host. One example which has bee=\r\nn discussed recently is Toxoplasma: the parasite lodges in the brain of rat=\r\ns and reduces their fear of cats. That way their chance of being eaten by a=\r\n cat is much greater, in the process of which the cat gets infected with To=\r\nxoplasma. http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?/catalyst/s=\r\ntories/s2050191.htm. \nResearch shows that Toxoplasma can also affect the be=\r\nhavior of humans. Apparently humans infected with Toxoplasma are more likel=\r\ny to be promiscuous, or to en dup in a car accident. Not much is known yet =\r\nabout the possible effects of parasitic infection on the behavior of humans=\r\n and animals, but it is certainly an interesting field of research that ope=\r\nns up here. \nWhat many do not know is that Toxoplasma infection is quite fr=\r\nequent, in that 30-40% of all humans host it. Sources are manifold: for exa=\r\nmple, test found Toxoplasma in 1 out of 67 samples of cured ham (http://www=\r\n.nzfsa.govt.nz/science/data-sheets/toxoplasma-gondii.pdf). So if you have b=\r\neen eating cured ham for some time, you are likely to have been exposed to =\r\nToxoplasma. Also, people who live with cats. &quot;\n \n \n \n What if it makes you =\r\nhear voices!? DOH!
