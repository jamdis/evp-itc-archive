<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Frank, hi group I&#x27;m glad to see there&#x27;s a place this topic can be discussed without the nasty junk I&#x27;ve seen spouted in a few places on the web and Frank I&#x27;m sorry to see you have to suffer that my friend you do not deserve it..

I closed the old forum where Frank kindly came along and shared his information with us a few years ago but great to see this forum and thanks for accepting me..

We do work with haunted dolls and spirits. My wife has 100 plus dolls and a non commercial site haunteddolls.net where we show them and talk about them. The few EVP&#x27;s are a little out of date - they were got in the usual way but it would be cool to have a ghost box because the spiritual events in this place are 24/7..

Apologies if I&#x27;ve missed it and there&#x27;s already a post on the subject but whats the best approach to a randomly scanning receiver as opposed to one that just scans sequentially ? 

Thanks ! Steve Gunn</pre>
