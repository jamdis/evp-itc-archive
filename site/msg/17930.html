<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The range of frequencies generally considered longwave are BELOW the AM
broadcast band in frequency - in the vicinity of 100 to 400 kHz (or even
lower). The wavelength of these frequencies ranges from 750 to 3000 meters -
approximately 0.5 to 1.8 miles. The longwave part of the spectrum is not
conducive to radio transmissions of wide bandwidth. In Europe there are some
AM radio stations in the 2000 to 1000 meter range. Very large antennas are
usually needed. In the USA, there are airport beacons in this frequency
range which send Morse code identifiers.

FM is in the VHF part of the spectrum. The wavelengths range from 2.8 to 3.4
meters - about 9.2 to 11.2 feet.

&gt; Does any one know anything about long wave lengths? And wide band widths?
&gt; Is FM a long wave?  My RS do not get signal on the AM where I am, and there
&gt; are limited stations here, actually only one or two radio stations, and they
&gt; are anywhere from 50 to 60 miles away for the closest very few stations.
&gt; For the heck of it I asked if they need the long wave, i got a &quot;yes&quot; out of
