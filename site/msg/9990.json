HOWEVER - I believe \nhe acted alone and that none of the other members of the Metascience \nFoundation were involved with this hoax. As to O&#39;Neil&#39;s motivation for \nthe hoax - I still don&#39;t know. But I will also say that the veridical \nevidence that O&#39;Neil claims to have received about Dr. George J. \nMueller through clairaudience is amazing and it is tough to see how \nO&#39;Neil would have gotten this information given his finances, location, \nthe timeframe, etc.\n\nI&#39;ve been promising to get my personal website up and operating for \nsome time now but have been busy. Hopefully soon. Then I&#39;ll start \nposting what I have found out so far.\n\nGuy Jackson\n\nP.S. The recordings of the Spiricom cassette that can be found at the \nGOS website ( http://www.ghostpix.com/spiricom/spiricom.html ) are very \npoor. Scott L over at Ghostly Talk pulled much a much cleaner version \ndirectly from a source cassette provided to him by Mark Macy ( see \nGhostly Talk show archive noted as a &quot;Bonus&quot; and &quot;Repost&quot; for August \n22, 2006: http://www.ghostlytalk.com/node/616 ). \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;alexrondini&quot; &lt;alexrondini@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt;     I&#39;m new on this group. Not too sure whether this topic was \n&gt; discussed already or not but I wanted to get your oppinion on the \n&gt; Spiricon device.  Does anyone know more about it?\n&gt; \n&gt; Alex\n&gt;"}
