That is an eye opener for me.\n\nThe association (ITC) now run by the Butlers used to be named, AA-EVP, I believe, so named by the creator of the group, Sarah Estep but they felt the name should be changed, why, who knows, never thought there was a problem with the original name.\n\nI am glad you posted this bit of information; I see some people in a different light now. I agree with you regarding the money aspect coloring the actions of some &quot;experts&quot; in the field, not everyone of course but enough to be cautious. They aren&#39;t fooling anyone but themselves in the long run.\nCB\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Re: Ghost Box Success Rate \nPosted by: &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; purplealiengirl@...   purplespacefriend \nSat Oct 2, 2010 11:52 pm (PDT) \nI know ther are real scientists out there that would probably study this\nstuff if it weren&#39;t for being ridiculed by the dumb ones. Unfortunate that\nthere are people that have put themselves in positions of authority, such as\nthe Bulters, that claim they had a team of &quot;more qualified listeners&quot; test\nthe boxes and they found nothing to it. Never asking me anything about the\nbox, or the theory behind it. Always these experts that know better. Some\nof these people have $$ interest in keep real knowledge hidden.\n\nF-S&lt;"}
