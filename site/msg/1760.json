I have posted only the two messages in the \nfile \n&gt; section under bhali sweep and sound file folder. they are the only \ntwo \n&gt; files in there I deleted the rest so as not to use up to much space.\n&gt; The first is it&#39;s me Mandy and the second is named long file and I \n&gt; believe it says &quot;awaiting something_ a man named Saul _he&#39;ll be \nasking \n&gt; for Mandy_ he&#39;s from our side_ he&#39;s a rabbi&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; please let me know what you think. There are quite a few more and \nI&#39;m \n&gt; only part way through the recording.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;"}
