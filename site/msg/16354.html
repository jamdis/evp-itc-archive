<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Al, don&#x27;t worry about it. These are simply people who no longer have bodies.
They are not evil or harmful, based on what you&#x27;ve posted. They&#x27;re just
lost. Otherwise they are probably just like they were in life. They are
harmless; at most they could be a nuisance, like an unwanted guest who sits
and gossips all day, etc. (we had one of those in our neighborhood when I
was growing up).

&gt; Would you mind sharing some of those recordings with us?
&gt;
&gt; You probably should contact the priest again.
&gt; It is my understanding that repeated visits are sometimes necessary.

&gt; &gt; Hi Dave,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, for example, I walked into our &quot;computer room&quot; (spare
&gt; &gt; bedroom/office/library) not long after the evps were recorded and my
&gt; &gt; radio turned itself on. My wife Patt witnessed it, so it&#x27;s not my
&gt; &gt; imagination that it did turn on. As I stepped into the room, the
&gt; &gt; &quot;morning show&quot; cut to a voice saying &quot;MMM! Cinnamon rolls and coffee!
&gt; &gt; Bring enough for us?&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I happened to be holding a mug of hot coffee and a plate of cinnamon
&gt; &gt; rolls that Patt had baked for breakfast. I scalded myself as I sloshed
&gt; &gt; coffee around after hearing the voice!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am not the type who tells stories or seeks attention.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I thought for a few moments that I was listening to a radio talk show
&gt; &gt; and that it was a coincidence that the mention of cinnamon rolls
&gt; &gt; happened as I stepped into the room. But I eventually blurted out a
&gt; &gt; &quot;hello,&quot; and was answered. After a few moments and to my questions,
&gt; &gt; the voice said his name was Steve Tate -- and following a
&gt; &gt; back-and-forth conversation that I recorded he said he was a Virginia
&gt; &gt; state trooper who died in 1989 in a car crash a mile from his home.
&gt; &gt; Over the next day or two, he said his body was buried in Redmond, Va.,
&gt; &gt; and we spoke for several days in little snatches of conversation.
&gt; &gt; Along the way, a fellow named &quot;Luke&quot; entered the conversation. Other
&gt; &gt; unnamed voices began to say &quot;Hi Al!&quot; It was a bit too much.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was brought up in a very strict Protestant family. I became leery of
&gt; &gt; what was unfolding. I bashed the radio and threw it in the trash. Then
&gt; &gt; I began hearing the voices mixed in with my CPAP machine (I have sleep
&gt; &gt; apnea) at night, which makes a high-pitched whooshing noise.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Next, I began hearing the &quot;Hi Al!&quot; voice as a faint whisper now and
&gt; &gt; then as I&#x27;d walk through the house.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I got scared. I had gotten rid of the radio(s) but was still hearing
&gt; &gt; the voices. I felt I was going crazy. I told my pastor about it and
&gt; &gt; asked for help. He refused -- said he was afraid he might get an
&gt; &gt; &quot;attachment&quot; and bring it home to his family. I contacted something
&gt; &gt; like 20 protestant pastors by phone and not a single one of them would
&gt; &gt; come to my home to help.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Eventually a Catholic priest agreed to help on the condition that I
&gt; &gt; supply a recording of the voices as &quot;proof&quot; of the problem. Using my
&gt; &gt; digital recorder, I recorded so many &quot;conversations&quot; that I filled up
&gt; &gt; a CD. Awhile later, after turning it over to the priest, the Catholic
&gt; &gt; bishop granted the priest permission to come to our home to conduct a
&gt; &gt; mass and an &quot;exorcism of place.&quot; The priest explained that old homes
&gt; &gt; and other places could become &quot;infested&quot; with evil spirits. After he
&gt; &gt; performed the ceremony, the voices seemed to quit for awhile but
&gt; &gt; returned after a few days.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now, I was not sure whether the voices were &quot;evil&quot; or just
&gt; &gt; &quot;conversational.&quot; My brother died of kidney failure during this time
&gt; &gt; and I later heard his voice calling my name. It ~was~ his voice.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A lot more has happened.... At this point, I am no longer &quot;surprised&quot;
&gt; &gt; by hearing the voices electronically or otherwise. I just want to know
&gt; &gt; more about what&#x27;s happening -- how it can possibly be &quot;real&quot; and what
&gt; &gt; I should understand in terms of the big picture....

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Al, and I&#x27;m new to this list. I&#x27;m 57, early-retired due
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; disability, and have far more free time than I want or know what to do
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Which is what got me in trouble recently. After watching &quot;White Noise&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; awhile back, one day I turned on a recorder and turned a radio tuner
&gt; while
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; asking if &quot;anyone&quot; would like to talk. To my great surprise, I found
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; voices
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; immediately after uploading and playing the file. I know about evps
&gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; watching the Ghost Hunters, but these voices were talking to me in a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conversational tone and about stuff relational to questions I asked
&gt; and to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; stuff I was doing at the time! This progressed over time into a
&gt; running
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;conversation&quot; with apparently living beings who are invisible but
&gt; somehow
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sharing this house! Can someone here please relieve my anxiety a bit?
&gt; I&#x27;m
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; wondering if I&#x27;m messing with something that I shouldn&#x27;t be messing
&gt; with.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; What are the consequences of this -- and can anyone enlighten me about
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rules or protocol for dealing with these invisible people? And, has
&gt; anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; found there is NO WAY to talk about this without sounding crazy??
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks,
