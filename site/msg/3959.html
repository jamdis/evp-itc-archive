"I believe that (and this is only my theory) that you can capture EVP anywh=
ere using just a regular recorder." 

Juli, yes you can get evp from anywhe=
re as long as you have some kind of complex sound to mix and record. I have=
 used the fan on my PC before and got really good results. I have used runn=
ing water, both shower and tap. I have used industrial fans at work and amb=
ient noise of a busy room.

They can use any complex sound to form speech. =
I am not just talking about your brain recognizing patterns and maybe you c=
an just make out what they are saying. I am talking about, using your name =
and telling you things very clearly kind of messages.

Regards,

Frank R.

Anne, I was wondering if you or the others could shed some light on va=
lidations received.  I have been conducting conventional EVP for sometime n=
ow and have utilized it for many areas.  I believe that (and this is only m=
y theory) that you can capture EVP anywhere using just a regular recorder. =
 In doing historical research on the answers provided by the other side, I =
have in some cases been able to validate the responses given using the conv=
entional method, backing it up with periodicals.   Since I have only conduc=
ted 2 test sessions with the hacked, I was curious as to those have been do=
ing this for a while been able to confirm some of responses received?  I kn=
ow Bruce confirmed that the other side knew what they where doing by cleani=
ng out his daughters room, but I was curious as to historical facts or thin=
gs of importance.
   
  The reason why I am asking is the first 2 sessions =
I asked direct
 questions pertaining to reports I had which was confirmed a=
nd never expected to received the responses I did in detail knowing that th=
ey were in fact true.  Have you or anyone ran any experiments in their sess=
ions to see if they are consistent in proving facts or predictions that hav=
e come true?
