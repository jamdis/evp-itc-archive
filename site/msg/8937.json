By the time you buy the unit and pay taxes on it, pay the eBay listing fee, spend \nyour time doing the hack, and packing/shipping, you might be losing money at that price.  \n\nMargaret  \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Marlboro63@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Stefan,\n&gt;  \n&gt; This guy who sells on Ebay does get 55.00 a unit for them.  He is out  f New \n&gt; York.  He originally wanted 129.00 for it.  I was considering  posted a 12-469 \n&gt; for 24.95 plus shipping and I will modify it for free or if  anyone wanted \n&gt; too I was going to post the instructions to modify one on the same  add just to \n&gt; screw with this guy.

Well, if people are paying  for it, then more\n&gt; &gt; power to &#39;em.\n&gt; \n&gt; On ebay.de I saw one for €25  (about €40), what is still expensive for\n&gt; such an old and low-quality  device.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been wanting to try the Raudive method with a  germanium diode.\n&gt; &gt; Radio shack only carries silicon, so I&#39;ll have to  order the germanium\n&gt; &gt; and give it a shot.\n&gt; \n&gt; You could also try a  schottky diode which is more sensitive than a\n&gt; german diode.
