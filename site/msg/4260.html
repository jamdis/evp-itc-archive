<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks, Bruce.  That&#x27;s what I thought you were doing, with respect to 
the 12-470 speaker and a mic.  The 12-469 apparently has a little 
more &quot;click&quot; noise, especially through the AM band, but still works.

&gt; LC,
&gt;  
&gt; I do My RS sessions with the 12-470 That has the internal speaker.
&gt; All I use to record the session is an olympus ws-200 DVR nothing 
else.
&gt;  
&gt; when the session is done I will use goldwave audio editor to slow 
down the playback by about 25%
&gt; and either amp it up or down whatever is needed. also if the 
recording is extra noisy due to bad signal I&#x27;ll run it through 
denoiser at the 
&gt; lowest setting just to remove some of the static hiss.

&gt; Hi, Bruce. Can you clarify how your RS hack system is set-up when 
you are receiving messages such as this one and in the files: &quot;11-26-
07_radio shack hack files_bruce&quot;. They seem much cleaner than what I 
am getting with the 12-469. Are these recorded right out of the 
speaker with an amped mic picking up your voice and the speaker 
sounds?Thanks...LC--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot;

the RS 470 my technition mike told me that our &gt; fellow researcher 
Jeff&#x27;s uncle was going to die from suffering a stroke.&gt; &gt; I informed 
jeff of the message and sent him the file. He wrote back &gt; asking If 
I could confirm this and get his uncles name.&gt; &gt; I did another quick 
session with the RS 470 and recieved the name mark &gt; from my guide 
lisa just once and then mike and lisa both shouted BOB,BOB&gt; die. &gt; &gt; 
I notified Jeff of this and he confirmed he had both an uncle Mark 
And &gt; an uncle Bob, after inquiring about the condition of his uncle 
Bob he &gt; was informed that his uncle Bob was hospitalised and 
graveley ill.&gt; &gt; He has not as of now suffered a stroke thank god, 
but jeff seems to &gt; think his prognoses is not good.&gt; &gt; I ask that we 
all say a prayer for Uncle Bob.&gt; &gt; I posted this and the accompanying 
file for pure research sake.&gt; &gt; Jeff has said he will keep me posted 
and I will appropriately keep the &gt; group informed.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt;
