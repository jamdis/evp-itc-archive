I did maybe a 2-3 minute session. Here&#39;s a few more. The last one, \nthat&#39;s what I was doing when I heard it. Often they talk about what I&#39;m \ndoing at any given moment, regardless of when it was recorded. Some may \nnotice, my &quot;guys&quot; almost always refer to me a in the feminine, one reason \nwhy I hate to post too many of those. With regular spirit contact, it&#39;s the \nopposite.\n\nThe only difference with this box is the echo box. Because I had to fit a \nbox a small area, I made it a wave guide echo box, and maybe most important, \nI made it out of soft steel from a computer case. The wave guide box has \nchannels that make the box acoustically larger, like a Bose Wave Radio.\n\nThanks for listening.\n\nFrank-S\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Box 13 voices.\n&gt;Date: Thu, 12 Jul 2007 04:54:19 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt;Totally clear message.
