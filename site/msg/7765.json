I&#39;ve done that with my dad, and there&#39;s times I \nswear we are talking two way--kinda mediumistically. I don&#39;t really \nhear the voice, but feel it, or feel the conversation. \n\n frank-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rhonda W &lt;rhondak1973@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks Frank.....I didnt even think about it that way, they have \nsome new things to learn before they can do that...kinda a duh moment \nfor me there.  I guess I just miss her so much and have so much that \nwent unsaid and unanswered on her part that I didnt even think about \nthat. but I know ur right...learning new things takes time.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Rhonda\n&gt; \n&gt; purplespacefriend &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           \n&gt; My sympathies! That story seems all too common in this society. It \n&gt; may take some time, first the spirit has to realize where they are, \n&gt; and then learn how to communicate. They seem to hear our thoughts, \nso \n&gt; I&#39;m sure your mother knows what was going on and how you feel. \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Rhonda W &lt;rhondak1973@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My mom just passed away on the 21st of Feb and I wasnt able to \nsee \n&gt; her for the past year or so mostly due to the fact that my sister \nwas \n&gt; selfish and wouldnt tell me what nursing home she put my mom in. \nShe \n&gt; sold my mom&#39;s house and property and gave her stuff to \ngoodwill...and \n&gt; she had the nerve to tell me via informal and rather rude email \nthat \n&gt; my mom passed and what a burden it was to her the past few months \n&gt; taking care of her. I know my mom knows that I loved her and will \n&gt; always...but I dont know if she knows what my sister did to keep me \n&gt; from her and I feel like a horrible daughter...not getting to see \nher \n&gt; before she passed. I finally got her address and phone number in a \n&gt; christmas card she sent me and I was able to call her for like 10 \n&gt; mins before she had to go eat...and when I tried calling back that \n&gt; night and several times after I only got her machine. I wanted to \ngo \n&gt; see her but didnt have a way to get all the way to where she \n&gt; was...not even the public buses run to\n&gt; &gt; where the nursing home was.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ive tried doing some EVPs to see if there was a chance of \n&gt; contacting her...I know ya dont usully get what ur looking \nfor...but \n&gt; Ive gotten nothing at all. So Im wondering....is there anyone who \n&gt; has done a skype session for this type of situation and gotten any \n&gt; success? And would you be willing to do a skype session with me?\n(Tho \n&gt; I have no idea how that would even work, Id be willing to \ntry...heck \n&gt; just to be able to listen to a session would be awesome) \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Rhonda\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo! \nMobile. \n&gt; Try it now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                          \n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
