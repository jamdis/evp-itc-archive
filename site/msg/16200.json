The first time I got my dad&#39;s friend \n  Gord=\r\ny, I didn&#39;t even hear his name; I thought he was saying &quot;Forty, forty, \n  f=\r\norty.&quot; It was only in a later session that he identified himself again usin=\r\ng \n  his full proper name. Then I realized that he is now dead (last I saw =\r\nhim he \n  was very much alive), and that he&#39;d been saying Gordy all along (=\r\nconfirmed by \n  playing back the old tape). I certainly didn&#39;t expect to he=\r\nar him come \n  through, and yet he did, so I can&#39;t see how I could&#39;ve expec=\r\nted to hear his \n  name.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jill&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A \n=\r\n  href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A=\r\n&gt;, \n  &quot;phenom_investigato&lt;WBR&gt;r&quot; &lt;phenom_investigato&lt;WBR&gt;r@&gt; wrote:&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Why do you disagree that PK is responsible for =\r\nmost true \n  EVPs? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; What about EVPs and/or PK tells you this m=\r\night be \n  so?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- I=\r\nn &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.=\r\ncom&lt;/A&gt;, \n  &quot;April Abercrombie&quot; &lt;april@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n  I agree in that much of EVP is just pareidolia, or the li=\r\nstener hearing what \n  he wants to hear.

This could =\r\ninclude discarnate agents. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt; When yo=\r\nu carefully consider what is being heard, the themes often seem to \n  refle=\r\nct what may be subconscious concerns of the operator or the listener. If \n =\r\n external sources additionally inform this process of perception, it is qui=\r\nte \n  possible they influence both what is recorded and how is later percei=\r\nved. This \n  would also nicely explain why some people hear the same things=\r\n on a recording \n  while others hear quite different things and more import=\r\nantly while one person \n  hears different things from the same recording at=\r\n different times.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It would also rem=\r\nove the requirement that \n  discarnates manifest the phenomena. If discarna=\r\ntes are indeed non-physical, it \n  is unclear how they would modify the phy=\r\nsical world. On the other hand, we \n  have good evidence demonstrating the =\r\nability of living individuals to alter \n  their environments in profound wa=\r\nys, apparently with their minds. So it seems \n  to make more sense that thi=\r\ns might indeed by the underlying mechanism to EVPs \n  rather than discarnat=\r\ne manipulations.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- \n  In &lt;A \n  href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups&lt;WBR&gt;.com&lt;/A&gt;, \n  =\r\n&quot;mrscaptainjack2&quot; &lt;jjkamp@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m wonderin=\r\ng \n  if a haunting-type situation such as yours would be different from tal=\r\nking to \n  your ancestors four or five generations back?
