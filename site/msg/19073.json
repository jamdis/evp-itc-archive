Kristin picked this up right away, but it was hard for me to hear with the headphones on. It seems that they say &quot;Steve Hultay&quot;, let me know if anybody else hears this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Remember, this was recorded live tonight during my radio show with no editing involved.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Steve Hultay\n&gt; www.keyportparanormal.com\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rtsc/\n&gt; www.stevehultay.com\n&gt; www.rtscresearch.org\n&gt; \n&gt; Attachment(s) from urkel23@... \n&gt; 1 of 1 File(s) \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; steve_hultay.mp3\n&gt;"}
