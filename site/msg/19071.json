I wanted to make the smallest possible dual supply\nrandom sweep box that I could. Dual supply cuz random doens&#39;t work so great\non sinlge supply and single supply requires more parts, even for linear\nsweep.\n\n I tuned the radio between statiosn cuz this tuner is sensitive enough to\nget distant AM stations even in my garage. You can use AM skip as the raw\naudio. On the first one at 2 seconds &quot;we&#39;re talklin&#39; to Frank&quot;, at 4 seconds\n&quot; I saw Frankie(my son) with you&quot; and at the end &quot;Frank Believe&quot;. In the\nsecond on at 3 seconds &quot;f--you purple&quot;, and at 13 seconds &quot;we&#39;ve go to end\nwith Bruce&quot;.\n\n F-S\n\nWhile wai ng o glue and a nish o d y on he box I was wo king, wen o Good Will and ound his une , a Toyo a wi h no ape deck o CD playe .  The hing wouldn' u n on so I could ge he pin ou o m measu ing ol ages, bu I had he pin ou o   he AM une in my no es om 2006, so ha is wah 's use he e.
