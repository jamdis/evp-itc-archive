Once again I think it comes down to our expectations again. I think to many=
 people expect a lot of these spirits to have some kind of special insight =
or access to some grand knowledge. I think that the only difference between=
 a lot of them and us are that they have transitioned beyond the physical a=
nd that is it. No matter how hard you try you cannot shake the "earth" vibr=
ation and you will continue to contact those close to the "earth" vibration=
. 

In order to contact the higher beings by technical means we have to gai=
n their interest and they have to come to us. We cannot transcend our level=
 to go to them without accessing higher levels of consciousness, which requ=
ires more than switching on a recorder.

Best regards,

Frank R.
