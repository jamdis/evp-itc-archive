<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I heard &quot;We nuke the people&quot; quite clearly, and bits of the other 
files.  Very dark stuff.  Is it possible in scanning the bands, that 
there&#x27;s a band, frequency or transmitter, perhaps governmental, that 
overrides scanning?

&gt;  This is weird, that mono tone voice coming through. This is what I 
get out of the segments I put up last night.  I wanted to see what 
others heard, as while recording all I heard was the usual shortwave 
stations, and noise. A few English stations, some Spanish, and 
something that sounded maybe Korean. 
&gt;  
&gt;  One of my co-workers thinks it he CIA messing with me, they just 
want to see what tunrs up on the net.   Awhhh crap, there&#x27;s only one 
way to go to be scientific, I&#x27;ll have to make another and see if it 
gets the same stuff for someone else.   My apologies to those waiting 
for previous projects and e-mail replies, I tend to get side tracked 
with this stuff.   Frank-S
