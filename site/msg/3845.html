&gt;  So, Ann, You think it&#x27;s OK for Chris to say all the BS he&#x27;s  
&gt; claiming against Us &amp; Frank?
&gt;

No, and I believe every post I have made makes that abundantly clear.  
That doesn&#x27;t mean that I am pro needless civil suits that instead  
should be settled with conversations between parties involved,of  
which you and I are not included.

&gt; ? As a Legal Secretary/assistant &amp; &quot;Independent&quot; Paranormal  
&gt; Investigator, etc. I disagree with you, but THAT&#x27;s OK!
&gt;
You&#x27;re right, it is okay for us to disagree.
&gt; =Judy= P.S.When you get your box, you can start your bussiness and  
&gt; make money, too, like Chris!! Perhaps that&#x27;s what&#x27;s needed . . .  
&gt; competition!
&gt;

I&#x27;ve never made a dime off my paranormal ability and I never will.

Thanks for playing,

Ann</pre>
