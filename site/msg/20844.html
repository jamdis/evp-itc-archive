<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>What happend to guy spouting all the new age-crystal skulls-spirit stuff? Is it decernment, or denial? When you look at the weather, the earthquakes, the actions of humanity--getting dumber and dumber by the day, the active debunking going on, the lack of news coverage for comets--it begins to look like something is going on. I don&#x27;t buy the Jesus stuff either, but that doesn&#x27;t negate the facts.

 As far other planets in the solar system, I think &quot;science&quot; has it all wrong, I think most are habitable in some form. I got voices saying they came from the sixth planet, presumably in this system, and once again I have ask, how would anyone else &quot;know better&quot;? I don&#x27;t believe constant and daily Earthquakes are the norm, or they wouldn&#x27;t be mentioned in the bible as a sign of the times. I think this planet is severely fractured, and very little holding it together. 
 What happens when you don&#x27;t keep moving parts lubricated--as in pulling out all the natural oil of the planet? I think we are living on a future asteroid belt as it ceases up and flies apart. Yet again, how would anyone &quot;know better&quot;? With only a slight amount of research, anyone can punch holes in every &quot;scientific&quot; theory all day long. Some dweeb in a university has a thought and it becomes gospel. Some duffus does a &quot;thought experiment&quot; and it&#x27;s irrefutable--how the f--- does that work!? You think it, therefore it is by virture of titles and degree?  If you don&#x27;t have titles and degrees, anything you think of is nonsensical. 

 yeah, rambling of a lunatickingnutcase.
