&gt; Bruce I tend to agree with on everything you just stated. I cherish 
my
&gt; FB and even though I must choose the location carefully with it it&#x27;s
&gt; the messages that come through that make it profound. But the Shack
&gt; Hack is an important development, the timing of it is ironic
&gt; considering other recent Box developments.

&gt; &gt; HEY GUY&#x27;S 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; OF COURSE I HAVE MY RS HACK AND GETTING RESULTS THE FIRST DAY.
&gt; &gt; MY INITIAL OPINION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS LITTLE GEM IS FROM 
TWO 
&gt; &gt; EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS ONE PERFORMED BY STEVE HULTAY AND MYSELF 
AND 
&gt; &gt; THE OTHER BY MYSELF ALONE. THE FILES I HAVE POSTED ARE GLEENED 
FROM 
&gt; &gt; ONLY THE FIRST MINUTE OR SO OF A TEN MINUTE RECORDING.PLEASE TAKE 
A 
&gt; &gt; MINUTE TO LISTEN AND POST YOUR FEEDBACK.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THE FILES ARE POSTED IN THE FILE SECTION UNDER: 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 11-26-07_radio shack hack files_Bruce 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; AFTER DOING ONLY ONE RECORDED SESSION AND TWO SESSIONS TOTAL. I 
AS A 
&gt; &gt; SERIOUS BOX RESEARCHER WITH EVRYDAY EXPERIMENTING ON 
FRANK&#x27;S,JOE&#x27;S 
&gt; &gt; AND NOW THE RADIO SHACK HACK BOX CAN PREMATURELY SAY THAT THIS 
RADIO 
&gt; &gt; MAY BE SMALL IN SIZE BUT IT PACKS A BIG PUNCH ! AND IT WAS UNDER 
OUR 
&gt; &gt; VERY NOSES ALL THE TIME. THANKS TO SUM DUC FOR HIS INSIGHT IN 
&gt; &gt; DISCOVERING IT.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING REDUNDENT I MUST REITERATE THIS RS BOX 
WILL 
&gt; &gt; HOLD IT&#x27;S OWN WITH THE BIG BOYS. THE RESULTS AND LEVEL OF 
&gt; &gt; COMMUNICATION BOTH IN REAL TIME DURING A SESSION AND WHAT IS 
MISSED 
&gt; &gt; BY OUR RUDIMENTARY HUMAN HEARING AND CAUGHT ON A RECORDING RIVALS 
OR 
&gt; &gt; MAY EVEN GIVEN ENOUGH TIME FOR FREQUENCY IMPRINTING BY OUR SPIRIT 
&gt; &gt; FRIENDS AND PROPER RESEARCH METHODS WILL SURPASS JOE&#x27;S BOX AND 
PULL A 
&gt; &gt; CLOSE SECOND TO FRANK&#x27;S BOX. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE RS BOX WAS 
REMINICENT 
&gt; &gt; OF THE AM LINEAR MODE OF MY FRANKS BOX #12. LET&#x27;S FACE IT A 
FRANKS 
&gt; &gt; BOX IS A FRANKS BOX IN AS NO TWO ARE EXACTLY THE SAME THAT IS 
WHAT 
&gt; &gt; MAKES THEM SO UNIQUE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT I BELIEVE A SMALL 
PART OF 
&gt; &gt; FRANK HIMSELF TRANSFERS INTO EVERY BOX HE MAKES AND HE IS VERY 
WELL 
&gt; &gt; RESPECTED ON THE OTHER SIDE FROM WHAT MY GUIDES AND TECHS TELL ME.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE RON RICKETS MINI BOX YET 
BUT I 
&gt; &gt; AM HEARING VERY GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT&#x27;S PERFORMANCE ALSO AND CAN 
NOT 
&gt; &gt; WAIT TO EXPERIMENT WITH IT.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I THINK OUR FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE FINALY DECIDING TO PUSH 
&gt; &gt; FORWARD WITH THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS AND ALLOW IT TO BECOME 
&gt; &gt; ACCESABLE TO MANY MORE PEOPLE. WHAT THEY HAVE CONVEYED TO ME OVER 
&gt; &gt; NUMEROUS SESSIONS IS THE DESPERATE AND INTRIGAL NEED FOR COMBINED 
&gt; &gt; HARMONY AMONG RESEARCHERS AND COMMUNICATORS. THE MORE MINDS THAT 
ARE 
&gt; &gt; THINKING AND MOVING TOGETHER FOR THIS COMMON GOAL THE STRONGER 
THE 
&gt; &gt; SPIRITS ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE AND THEY WILL HELP WITH DEVELOPE 
MENT 
&gt; &gt; OF THE TECHNOLOGY SO THINGS ARE LOOKING UP AND HEADING TO THE 
FUTURE. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; WHAT I HAVE GATHERED OVER MANY SESSIONS IS THEY DEFINATELY WANT 
THE 
&gt; &gt; WORD AND THE TECHNOLOGY SPREAD TO AS MANY AS ARE WILLING TO 
ACCEPT IT 
&gt; &gt; WITH AN OPEN MIND. I AM RATTLING ON AND HAVE DRIFTED FROM MY 
ORIGINAL 
&gt; &gt; POINT WHICH WAS, THIS RADIO SHACK BOX IS AND WILL BE A VERY 
IMPORTANT 
&gt; &gt; AND USEFULL TOOL IN FURTHERING OUR COMMUNICATION PROCESS.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; THANKS FOR LISTENING.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; BRUCE
