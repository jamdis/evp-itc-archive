It's amazing stuff, but it's like you have to let it works itself. I think=
 Ron Ricketts is going to be really busy, there's people that see the You T=
ube videos that want boxes, so I give them the Paranormal Systems link.
 
 =
I could be making all those boxes, but somethings are more important, like =
using the boxes, and having time to experiment. I've like to get my own des=
ign out there, but I still haven't rsolved all the issues with it, nor answ=
ered al my questions about an ideal configuration.
