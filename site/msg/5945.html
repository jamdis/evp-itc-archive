See what I mean!
 
nothin but a shit stirrer.
Always comes up with these l=
ittle innuendo's
and accusations. 
 
Your so concerned with file tampering =
check your friends files first,
 
Oh that's right there has never been one =
posted! oops my mistake.
anyway go crawl back to your master and say we are=
 wise to this bullshit already.
 
I just explained why and how I remove tim=
e from my files and I'm not the only
researcher that does that. Matter of f=
act I believe it's common practice. 
 
And even with the segments of noise =
between the words being removed the files
are what they are no words have b=
een altered, and they are posted for all to hear.
More than I can say for s=
ome supposed researchers.
 
don't worry so much about time being removed fr=
om our files try concentrating on people 
hiding in balconies with micropho=
nes.

Time is absolutely being removed from the audio files. There i=

to train your eyes as well as your ears to make any sort ofjudgment. The se=
cond I load some of these files, before I listen, Isee problems. I know the=
 site isn't set up to really leave comments onfiles with the file but somet=
hing should be included in the name orsomething. Without it, it is not true=
 representation of what the fileis or what has happened between the capture=
 and the post. We listenand think "Wow! Great catch" but we really do not k=
now. Are you starting the scan on your 3 469's at different frequencies?Wha=
t is the ratio being mixed? Is it equal between the three? I believe that M=
ark and Debbie Constantino (sp)of Nevada use wateralmost exclusively for th=
eir recordings. I have found that method tobe difficult in hearing the resu=
lts. Are you feeling that thosecommunications are from spirits or earthboun=
ds and what makes you feelthat way?I've recently started analyzing a 40 min=
 469 session. The results arescary. I'd say at this point, and I'm only 1/2=
 way through, 90% of thecommunication is negative in nature and mentions ma=

e. Truly, we aren't researching if we don't have some<BR>> <BR>> prot=
ocol in place.<BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> Here is an issue I have w=
ith the RS Hacks. I have the 469. It takes<BR>> <BR>> approximately 1=
8 seconds to scan through the AM frequencies. Now, the<BR>> <BR>> typ=
ical person would think that we can take that 18 seconds and divide<BR>>=
 <BR>> it by the number of AM stations to determine how long we are on e=
ach<BR>> <BR>> station before moving on to the next one. In that way =
we could<BR>> <BR>> determine what is impossible to be said via a rad=
io fragment. However,<BR>> <BR>> that's not correct. The scan cycle c=
an vary from one frequency to the<BR>> <BR>> next and of course the b=
iggest problem is that some stations are<BR>> <BR>> picked up over mu=
ltiple frequencies; AM 640 can be heard on 630, 640,<BR>> <BR>> 650, =
660 and maybe even 670. That extends the time a great deal. This<BR>> <B=
R>> is a difficult problem because it is almost impossible for the avera=
ge<BR>> <BR>> person to be able to make a determination on time this =
way. <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> I heard about the following today;=
 An experimenter records at the same<BR>> <BR>> time every day Mon-Fr=
i. We hear about the importance of meditating,<BR>> <BR>> automatic w=
riting, etc at the same time every day but what we have to<BR>> <BR>>=
 remember with this, is that now we are in essence tuning into the same<BR>=
> <BR>> radio show every day. One of my first experiments with the 46=
9 had me<BR>> <BR>> hearing this deep male voice over and over again.=
 What was he trying<BR>> <BR>> to tell me, I wondered. Than I realize=
d that he was speaking<BR>> <BR>> approximately every 18 seconds; eve=
ry time the scan hit that station.<BR>> <BR>> So, if you are removing=
 up to 18 seconds between words, then you are<BR>> <BR>> really only =
recording the words from one station. <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> T=
his post is IN NO WAY trying to start anything besides discussion<BR>> <=
BR>> about some research problems. I know that there are those who are n=
ot<BR>> <BR>> concerned with anything more than the communication its=
elf but I think<BR>> <BR>> that it is of the utmost importance to att=
empt to factor in some<BR>> <BR>> protocol in order for this to be co=
nsidered serious research at all. <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>> <BR>&=
