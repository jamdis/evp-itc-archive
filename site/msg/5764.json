Any idea what that means?\n\nLC\nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I did my first session in a week and got a couple good files, please \n&gt; listen if you get a chance.  Also, has anybody ever though of \nrecording \n&gt; an EVP Maker session in MP3 format and play it back later plugged \ninto \n&gt; speakers through an MP3 player while asking questions.  I had \nattempted \n&gt; it about a year ago with minimal success.  I think they need the live \n&gt; stream, but if anybody is willing to test it out i would love to hear \n&gt; the results.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Steve H.\n&gt;"}
