 I kept telling everyone I was not the first to do the sweep method, and t=
hanks to Stefen Bion, I finally got the guy's name! While it's somewhat dif=
ferent than what I do with the swept radio method, it's the same concept. C=
heck the date on the bottom of the page. The Europeans were experimenting w=
ith this stuff back in the 80s and 90s. Needless to say Edison did not inve=
nt the boxes! Facts is facts, and sooner or later the truth comes out. It's=
 important not to go ego tripping, seeking the big bucks and Hollywood spot=
lights, but freely share information. 
 
 These guys were even playing with=
 speech sythesizers back in the 90's, so nothing new there either.
