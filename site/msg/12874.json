I&#39;ve completed another prototype diode device for EVP capture.  \nThis one I put in a clear case so you can see the circuit.  It is \nsimilar to the first one I designed (Device #1) and built, except this \none (Device #2) uses a slightly different coil with ferrite core and \ndifferent diodes. Their breakdown voltage is less than the first I used.\n\nYou can see pictures of it here:\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com/mikes_diode_evp_device.htm\n\nIt&#39;s on the webpage, below Device #1.\n\nThe audio from my first test is here:\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com/sessions/diodeplasma2.WMA\n\nThanks,\n- Mike C.
