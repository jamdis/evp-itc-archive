  Yes like a magnet for them. People ask me when did I become interested in "them" and rather than answer my reply is usually its more like when did "they" become interested in me.
   
  We'd love to hear your evp you get during your experiment. I checked my files and tho there are many hello's said many different ways I have never had a "yes hello" to my knowledge.
   
  As for the itc pics, I guess some could be considered "scary" LOL but I have never had any fear about any of this. I've dealt with the paranormal so long that to me its just normal. Tho when I first started the itc pics I would get hundreds of eyes staring back at me, it was a bit creepy. Then during evp they mentioned the pics and said "echo six is ready we have to look happy to you" so I did more itc and got alot of smiles and teeth. Creepier LOL. In later evp someone said "I told you were looking happy".
   
  They have also shown me pics/artwork of the "living". 
   
  I find it all quite fascinating.
