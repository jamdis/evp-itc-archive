It is based on that random principle, and \npredates the boxes.\n\n I&#39;ve heard this stuff before, about random being the best, and I \nhave to disaggree. I also think it unwise to spend every waking \nmoment doing sessions. I think it creates that expectation, and \nperhaps desperation to make contact, and I would tend not to trust \nwhat comes through. \n\n I don&#39;t trust some of this stuff because I have yet get any \nmeaningful assistence with the boxes from the so called technicians. \nAll I ever got was a telepathic &quot;suggestion&quot; to use the echo boxes. \nEverything else was a assemblage of stuff I had worked on in hte past \nto solve the problem of &quot;what else could I use&quot;. \n\n I hate to see yet another go down the road of &quot;this is the onlyest \nway&quot;. \n\n Frank-S"}
