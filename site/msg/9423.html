<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yep, Frank.  Chinese.  I posted the translation last night.  Basically all they were 
mentioning is it being like Frank&#x27;s box/telephone to the dead.  It&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t a sale or even an 
article.  I guess it was someone just posting to see if others have heard of it?  But nobody 
has replied.

&gt;  I would be interested in seeing/hearing what they said. Can&#x27;t tell if it was a paranormal 
site, or skeptics. I would like to know if they&#x27;ve heard of the RS hack.  I would be 
interested in sharing info. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I&#x27;m not 100% sure that&#x27;s Japanese, the writting looks Chinese to me.
