Hi Rees,
 
I just got my paranormal puck a couple of days ago and in regular  people 
terms, it takes readings from the environment:  EMF  (man-made and natural), 
voltage, frequency, and temperature, and  translate those readings into words from 
a 2,000 word dictionary.  It also  logs all the readings on a spreadsheet.  
You can also set alarms and  threshholds for spikes, and well as incorporate a 
PC camera or audio device to  record pictures, video or audio whenever your 
alarms are reached.  It's a  very interesting device.  One of the first 
questions I asked it was  "Who are you?"  It answered "Edison, reincarnation".   I 
brought  it to a meeting today of the group I belong to, the San Francisco Ghost 
Society,  and when our resident psychic asked it "What's my name?"  It replied 
with  the word "Medium".  Like I said, it's a very interesting device,  
indeed!  The inventor refers to the device not as an ITC device, but  rather, a ECM 
device -- for Environmental Communications Mode, as it is driven  purely from 
environmental data alone.
