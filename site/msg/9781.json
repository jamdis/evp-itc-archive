Hope to have some of my \nsession files up soon. I have to share my computer at home with my \n16 year old son so mom doesnt get much time on it. I dont think the \nspirits like the 12-280 or I have just not learned to hear them on \nthe FM band it sweeps so fast on the 12-820. I wont give up on it \nthough.\n\nKay\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Wiliam Clarke &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kay\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Yes I did get the 12-820, and I didn&#39;t get very good reception \nwith it.  For some reason I can&#39;t get myself away from the 12-469.  \nI have been getting some tremendous results with it. \n&gt;   If you have a 12-469, just give it a try, you&#39;ll get some \nresults soon, or maybe you haven&#39;t got your EVP real-time \ncommunication ears yet.  It took me awhile to get mine, and still I \nmiss some things.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Later \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Rees\n&gt; \n&gt; psfponies &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           Rees\n&gt; \n&gt; Did you get the RS 12-820 yet? Wondering if it is working good for \nyou.\n&gt; I havent got anyone to talk to me on it yet. \n&gt; \n&gt; Kay\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                            \n&gt; \n&gt;  between 0000-00-00 and 9999-99-99\n&gt;"}
