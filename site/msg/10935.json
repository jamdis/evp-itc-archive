I am a lead investigator\nfor the Bluegrass Ghost Chasers in Frankfort, KY.  I recently found\nthe video instructions by UFO geek on the hack for the RS 12-469 radio\nand have built myself a small Ghost box.  I&#39;ve become intrigued with\nthe prospect of taking this with the group on investigations and\nshould have a chance to take it with me to Waverly Hills Sanatorium\nlate next month.  I also found this group through Mike&#39;s Blog site. \nAny and all tips and opinions will be greatly appreciated and if I\ncome up with anything I&#39;ll make sure and share with this group."}
