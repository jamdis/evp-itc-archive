Colleges=
 can't really teach you about  unproven terms and ideologies. They

Just like paranormal inve=

Science people will tell you there  is no astral. T=
he term "Astral" was 
coined by the first people who  experienced this real=
m. But all words were 
coined. Even words such as  dog or cat. 
 
Also, sub=
conscious means below  conscious or not conscious. So it isn't 
incorrect, =
though maybe some  scholarly types will tell you it isn't proper. 
Again, a=
ll words were  coined.
 
You have to remember that colleges and  schools ar=
e mostly made up by 
people, people who think only  scientifically. I know-=
not all people in colleges 
think this way, but that  is what learning inst=
itutions are based on. They 
reject any term they  can't grasp or understan=
d under a microscope.
 
All this is besides the point  though.
