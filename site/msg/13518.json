I&#39;ve uploaded a few additional images some of you may find interesting from the same experiment. Check them out if you&#39;d like. You can find them in the Georgia State Paranormal folder.\n\nI&#39;d like to hear some theories on how and why you think ITC works, especially related to the water method application. Do a lot of you use this method? If you do, do you apply your results in investigations? My home is inhabited by a &quot;visitor&quot; at the present time. Have any of you used ITC as in tool in your paranormal investigations with any success?"}
