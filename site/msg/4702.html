No sniping needed! There =

 email, if you took offense to anything I wrote, it was not meant that way.=
 I agree most people in the paranormal community (The Ghost Hunter generati=
on) do not have the understanding to grasp what we as a group are saying. I=
 have had endless arguments with paranormal investigators over this very su=
bject. Is it real or is it delusional rhetoric? To my knowledge no one has =
ever won that argument on either side of the coin. They say prove it, we sa=
y disprove it! With that being said, I am not a box researcher, I am an ITC=
 researcher. I use many methods to obtain the messages I get because the me=
ssage, not the equipment is what's important.Potential researchers will mak=
e their way to us at their own pace because we cannot force people to 'get =
it'. The connection we share with our spirit friends is through our hearts =
and spirits. Its a positive attitude, pure intent, desire and the will to c=
ommunicate that allows those switches to be flipped in our minds.I agree wi=
th you totally Bruce. We need more and more people with the above mentioned=
 attributes in this world let alone this field of research. Can we ever pro=
ve to anyone that this is real? No! Can we show them it is real? We can try=
! People may call me a defeatist for not promoting or defending ITC, but I =
don't think so. My original goal is not to convince the world that this is =
real. If they are supposed to "get it", they will.Best Regards,Frank R.
