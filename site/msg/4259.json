I \nwill upload them in a minute under Ursula- Joe&#39;s Box. \n\nThe two clips are actually from the second session, which I did about \nfive minutes after the first, uneventful one.\n\nBoth clips are from the same session.\n\nThe first clip is from the beginnng of the four-minute session.  I \nhave just asked, &quot;Is there something you want to say?&quot; and then \nbefore and while I repeat the question, a voice says, &quot;-the fuck up.  \nShut the--&quot;\n\nThe second clip happens later.  I had asked &quot;What is my name?&quot; and \nthe earlier (&quot;shutthefuckup&quot;) smart-alecky voice had answered &quot;Ursula \nAnne&quot; in a singsong way (This is a little weird because my real name \nis Anne Ursula, so kids used to tease me by calling me Ursula Anne at \nschool after I started going by my middle name at age 11.) \n\nThe second clip starts immediately after, when the same voice \nsays, &quot;Zip It!&quot;\nThen, a second voice says, &quot;Shhh. Listen, you&#39;ll scare her.&quot; \nThen the first voice says, &quot;Aww!&quot;  Then something I can&#39;t make out in \nshort bursts.\nThen, I say &quot;I&#39;m listening&quot; because I heard &quot;Listen&quot; from the second \nvoice.\nAfter my voice you hear &quot;Here you go!&quot; and then &quot;What&#39;s Up?!&quot; from \nthat second voice again.\n\nI&#39;m full of wonder about this box.  It was odd. People say the boxes \nFEEL different from anything else, and I really did.  I KNEW somehow \nwhen I started that second session that there would be something, and \nit was like the language opened itself up to me.  It&#39;s a very \ndifferent sounding sort of thing from anything else.  I can&#39;t really \ndescribe it.  It&#39;s much, much different from anything I&#39;ve done \nbefore and quite Awe-some in a literal sense.\n\nI was also very surprised that I wasn&#39;t at all afraid of whatever \nidiot was swearing and saying stupid things.  Like a bully on a \nplayground, really.  Nothing scarier than that.  \n\nThanks, Steve, for giving me the chance to experience this tool.  And \nthanks, Frank, dear Frank who I&#39;ve never met, for having the box idea \nin the first place.\n\nUrsula"}
