Oh no Frank I'm blaming that discovery on you and Retro Dave LOL. 
=A0
You =
guys were talking about a few theoretical ideas in a conversation, I just d=
ecided to test that out for myself. They told me the previous year you two =
would work together I just didnt understand what that meant. Results were g=
reat. Shared the results, rest is history.

I dunno how you got the RVG =
to work either (I'm dumb as a doornail when it comes to that technical stuf=

everything even if I dont understand=A0it.

Ive saved every evp and itc=
