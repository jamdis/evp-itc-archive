<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>well, I&#x27;m still here. I try to more patient these days, and instead 
of arguing, I&#x27;d rather just go do my own thing, and the ones 
claiming to be experts can have it. 

 Even after making the boxes since 2002, I have no idea how or why 
it works, I only know if you do certain things, &quot;they&quot; talk. I don&#x27;t 
do investigations, and still think there is no haunting if no one 
living is there to see/experience it. Spirit is pretty much 
infinately more sophistcated than most imagine. As far as I can 
tell, all limitations are on this side of the veil. 

 I get a little irritated when I make the boxes, yet someone else is 
going to tell me how it really works, especially when they 
themselves have no technical knowledge on any level.

 For me, I enjoy the challenge of getting this stuff to work, and 
the voices are a joy to hear, but almost secondary. I work alone, 
and don&#x27;t need the group&#x27;s approval, so when someone is claiming to 
be the atuhority on this stuff, I don&#x27;t care, I can just as easily 
quit the group and work by myself, which is pretty much what I 
prefer anyway. 

 Mass production doesn&#x27;t seem to come together, like I think it 
would if it was supposed to be, so I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a direction 
I want to pursue. I try to just provide the informatiin on what I do 
so others can dupicate it when possible.

&gt; It&#x27;s too bad one or two people ruin it for the rest of us.  Only 
20% of 
&gt; the population have antisocial tendencies and only a couple 
percent are 
&gt; truly antisocial.  Sometimes it gets to you, but keep in mind it&#x27;s 
only a 
&gt; couple people. Also keep in mind the old Yank Latin saying, &quot;Non 
&gt; carborundum illegitimatus!&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I joined this group ONLY because Frank S. was on it and I hoped to 
keep up 
&gt; on his research. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do now.

&gt; &gt; I didn&#x27;t read any resulting posts from what I posted earlier, 
and I&#x27;m not sure I want to. I&#x27;ve been doing this for some years now, 
and it seems like ya can&#x27;t go two weeks without someone that thinks 
they know more, or their &quot;theories&quot; are more valid, or someone that 
believes for whatever reason they are the box/EVP/paranormal expert. 
I&#x27;ve had enough, these groups are pointless, and I&#x27;m tired of the 
BS. There is always these incessant arguements with those that seem 
to think they know better than anyone else. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, and 
my over reactions, but at this point, I don&#x27;t care, enough is 
enough. So ya want the group? I don&#x27;t actually own it due to one of 
these idiotic arguements, but have at it, cuz I ain&#x27;t playing this 
game anymore. I&#x27;ll continue my own work, in my own time, and in my 
own way.
