<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Okay then, this makes me step back and ask WTF? I think hear something,
post what I thought I heard, then listen the next day, and it&#x27;s nothing but
broadcast frags. In #6 now &quot;frank&#x27;s ol&#x27; lady---wormwood...&quot;, and 8, &quot;he&#x27;s
got a good idea....&quot; Ya have to be able to ask, what if it is all just
brain? If no one in the world hears the same sutff, is it valid? and who
thinks their hearing is so much more superior to anyone else&#x27;s that they can
tell what it really says. So far, these other experts seem to hear only
frags.  All I can figure is that we get enough to show others, and ourselves
that something is going on, but most of the communication is just using the
sounds being used as a psychic prop--in the brain. It does not mean the
communication is invalid, or what one hears false. It just means it&#x27;s more
personal, and not provable. Round and round, till one finally breaks loose,
and hits this wall. I find myself questioning this stuff more and more.

 I don&#x27;t know what to think anymore, I came up with this braindead box idea,
and it seems to work for everyone except me. I&#x27;m thinkin&#x27; I wasted my IT
career for this crap.

&gt;  Had a Sony AM/FM/Cassette/CD boom box that I got two years ago for $3. I
&gt; made a sweep board for it this afternoon, then found it had a seperate tuner
&gt; board. So I liberated the tuner from the rest, and striped everything else
&gt; for parts. It make primo box! This runs on six volts and takes a signal wire
&gt; to change bands.
&gt;
&gt;  #6 starts out &quot;Is Hultay even---wormwood&quot;. #8 is cool &quot;I think that he
&gt; videos this reciever&quot;, after that &quot;the alamo&#x27;s on ten meter basement(?)&quot; teh
&gt; 10 meter band is at 28 to 29.5 mhz, it&#x27;s one of the ham bands. So is
&gt; basement the bottom if 10 meters, at about 28.5Mhz if I remember right? Now
&gt; that&#x27;s a trip, cuz I was switching between AM and FM.
