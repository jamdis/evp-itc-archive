Going along these lines of thought, if you are recording the questions onto an audio tape and leaving 20 seconds of silence between them, you are still recording you and possibly your thoughts as well as any spirits that might be around you or your recording environment at that time.  So how do you know that what you listen back on is from the location you placed the recorder in and not from the location you recorded the questions in or from your own creation?  Just something to think about.\n   \n  Lynn\n   \n  \n\nTracy &lt;loneshewolf999@...&gt; wrote:\n            I am not sure this would still rule it out.  I don&#39;t think psychokinesis is restrained by walls, the mind isn&#39;t restrained by walls whether human or deceased.  I am guessing that psychokinesis behaves similar to telepathy....\n   \n  I believe many evp&#39;s are deceased spirits, but the question on whether it could be a living person imprinting the evps was certainly one that made me really think !  \n\nFrank Ratka &lt;warrior18eii@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hi James,\n\nBack when I still investigated haunted sites, our team did this on various occasions within a house where we recorded several hours of activity over a few years (a long term investigation). We would leave our audio equipment recording in several &quot;hot spots&quot; all over the house and then leave for an hour or two. I have to say, in our experience we never got an EVP while we were out of the house. As a matter of fact we had an EVP when we reentered the house saying, &quot;here they come, lets go&quot;. I don&#39;t necessarily understand why a ghost or spirit would talk with no one present to receive the message unless during setup you explained what you are trying to accomplish and what the spirits roll is in the experiment (we never tried explaining). A piece of machinery (recorders) in an empty room does not have a consciousness or spiritual presence I would be interested to see if you get different results.\n\nRegards,\n\nFrank\n\n  ----- Original Message ----\nFrom: delchay2005 &lt;azredant@...&gt;\nTo: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Tuesday, September 18, 2007 6:47:24 PM\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] EVP Experiment planned in October.\n\n    To try and rule out that the EVP researchers are imprinting voices \npsychokinetically on audio players mistaken as ghosts voices, I will \npre-tape an interactive evp session.\n\nI will record a bank of thirty questions, 20 seconds of silence \nafter each question, on a cassete tape and played on a cassette \nplayer that will be utilized in all three buildings in a known \nhaunted location just outside of Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nThere will be digital recorders, cassette recorders, omni \ndirectional microphones, condensor microphones, as well as an \nelectrocet boom microphone present in all of the sessions.
