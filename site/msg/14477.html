I don't think they would have to know this to make it happen. We already kn=
ow it happens and I bet that the spirit doesn't know exactly how it accompl=
ished it.

Sure, there could be another factor that we just don't know abou=
t that makes EVP possible.

"It is much more credible for the signal to be =
manipulated near the AtoD converter (where EMF changes would have the most =

        Manipulating EMF is one thing.  But =

                  Probably =
not "directly", since that would mean grandma would have to have quite an u=
nderstanding of digital encoding, including which bits mean what, when, and=
 where.  But even on a digital recorder, there is still an analog element (=
the Analog to Digital converter) which takes the sound pressure waves, as r=
epresented by some analog electronic detection element, and converts that i=
nto digital.  That way, long departed uncle Ebenezer does not need to do an=
ything digital.  Under this scenario, if sound is not being heard in the ro=
om, but is being induced into the circuitry, then it would be round about t=
hat AtoD converter (assuming it isn't other just plain old noise in the dig=
ital elements).  

                  Someone with more electronic know-how =
than me might be able to better pinpoint the area in the analog portion of =
that AtoD pipeline where it would be most likely it could be influenced by,=
 say, an EM field, and that would also occur in a normal analog tape record=
er.
