Since you are using DC6 or 7 in live format than it is most likely just an =
audio feedback loop. In other words your speakers are too close to your mic=
rophone. If this is the case then you should not have any feedback if you a=
re using headphones. Also, as a precaution your microphone should have some=
 kind of foam-rubber or acoustic mesh covering the membrane. If not, any ul=
trasonics can cause distortions in the recording.

The big think though is =
to keep the microphone and speakers as far apart as possible.
