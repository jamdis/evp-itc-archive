Seems from what the angels say, the grandma and mom Casey got into a \n fight, Casey was mad so when the parents were gone, she put the baby into \nthe  truck, and closed the lid, she may have been tied so she couldn&#39;t get \nout and or  druged.  In one of the files, you can hear Caylee crying for her \nmama, she  stills asks for her mother, and the angels are saying, that \n&quot;Christ holds the  baby&quot;  I have lots of files now, there are but a few.  I think \nthe  spirit say, her mother will &quot;get life.&quot; sf\n\r\n--part1_865f.72b46b49.3b26e547_alt_boundary\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3DUS-ASCII&quot;&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.17097&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY id=\r\n=3Drole_body style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot; =\r\n bottomMargin=3D7 leftMargin=3D7 topMargin=3D7 rightMargin=3D7&gt;&lt;FONT id=3Dr=\r\nole_document  face=3DArial color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Well, I have some=\r\n info from the peanut gallery, most is high pitched so \nmany of you guys wo=\r\nn&#39;t understand it, signing type angel files, I didn&#39;t want to \nbelieve how =\r\na mother could kill her own child, but it seems she did the \ndeed.&nbsp; Se=\r\nems from what the angels say, the grandma and mom Casey got into a \nfight, =\r\nCasey was mad so when the parents were gone, she put the baby into the \ntru=\r\nck, and closed the lid, she may have been tied so she couldn&#39;t get out and =\r\nor \ndruged.&nbsp; In one of the files, you can hear Caylee crying for her m=\r\nama, she \nstills asks for her mother, and the angels are saying, that &quot;Chri=\r\nst holds the \nbaby&quot;&nbsp; I have lots of files now, there are but a few.&nb=\r\nsp; I think the \nspirit say, her mother will &quot;get life.&quot;&nbsp;sf&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FON=\r\nT&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n--part1_865f.72b46b49.3b26e547_alt_boundary--\r\n\n\r\n--part1_865f.72b46b49.3b26e547_boundary\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream;\n\tname=&quot;A_her mother did it and went back in her house.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=&quot;A_her mother did it and went back in her house.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--part1_865f.72b46b49.3b26e547_boundary\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream; name=&quot;A_her mother is a monster.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;A_her mother is a monster.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--part1_865f.72b46b49.3b26e547_boundary\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream;\n\tname=&quot;A_she couldn&#39;t get out her mother did it.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=&quot;A_she couldn&#39;t get out her mother did it.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--part1_865f.72b46b49.3b26e547_boundary\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream; name=&quot;A_she left her in the trunk.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;A_she left her in the trunk.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--part1_865f.72b46b49.3b26e547_boundary\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream;\n\tname=&quot;A_the mother put her in a truck.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;A_the mother put her in a truck.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--part1_865f.72b46b49.3b26e547_boundary\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream; name=&quot;B_Casey.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;B_Casey.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--part1_865f.72b46b49.3b26e547_boundary\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream; name=&quot;C_grandma got mad.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;C_grandma got mad.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--part1_865f.72b46b49.3b26e547_boundary\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream;\n\tname=&quot;C_she murdered her let the trunk close.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=&quot;C_she murdered her let the trunk close.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--part1_865f.72b46b49.3b26e547_boundary\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream;\n\tname=&quot;C_she murdered her the mother did it.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=&quot;C_she murdered her the mother did it.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--part1_865f.72b46b49.3b26e547_boundary\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream;\n\tname=&quot;D_she wants her mother -talk to her_mommy-your close.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=&quot;D_she wants her mother -talk to her_mommy-your close.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--part1_865f.72b46b49.3b26e547_boundary\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream; name=&quot;H_Christ holds the babe.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;H_Christ holds the babe.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--part1_865f.72b46b49.3b26e547_boundary--"}
