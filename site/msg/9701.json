Again, I look to relevance to be key, and\nrelevant info that \n&gt; would not come easily to a stranger is even better. \n&gt; \n&gt; For example, I turned on my MiniBox for the very first time and\nsaid, &quot;Hello?&quot; and \n&gt; immediately received the response, &quot;Hello Margaret.&quot; If this were a\nhoax, how could that \n&gt; person know in less than 10 seconds, who I was by name. I had not\ngiven this information \n&gt; out. Not to mention that you have people experimenting 24/7 and\nreceiving similar \n&gt; responses. How in the world could an organization have the\nmanpower, technology, or \n&gt; even the desire, to attempt such a hoax? I mean that as a genuine\ninquiry, because there \n&gt; might be an explanation I have not thought of. \n&gt; \n&gt; I have one example where, via radio sweep, my communicator was able\nto correctly \n&gt; identify the status and location of a missing person (who it turns\nout was alive and well, so \n&gt; we ended up with confirmation that the info given had indeed been\ncorrect - which is \n&gt; much less complicated that trying to track and understand the clues\nwhen associated with \n&gt; the dead, or missing but not found.) Again, if a hoax, would that\nhave simply been a \n&gt; lucky guess on the part of the hoaxer?\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottom line for me is ... have I wondered if it could be a hoax? Or\nsimply a fortuitous \n&gt; tuning of the dial? Yes, on both accounts. But there is enough\ncompelling evidence to rule \n&gt; out both of them as an explanation for the far too many relevant\nexamples received by so \n&gt; many of us.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good food for thought, but after digesting it, I&#39;d have to say, &quot;No,\na sophisticated hoax \n&gt; does not sufficiently explain the phenomena on a large scale.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Nathan Sharman &lt;v1230mail@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Has it ever occurred to you, that some one or\n&gt; &gt; organisation, could be using a radio to say the things\n&gt; &gt; you heard?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This whole radio and spirit voices, could be a MASSIVE\n&gt; &gt; HOAX, perpetuated by some one with a sophisticated\n&gt; &gt; multi-transmission two way radio.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Think about it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; THAT IS WHY I USE EVPmaker only to commuincate with\n&gt; &gt; the other dimension.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Tired of spam?
