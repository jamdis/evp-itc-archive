Hi Ursula,
 
Welcome to the group. My name is Bruce, I am one of the indivi=
duals on this group that does
extensive research with Frank's box and Joe's=
 box on real time evp communication.
 
There are a couple of other methods =
that you can use that some of us here at the group find a bit
more producti=
ve than traditional evp recording. And will supply not only recorded but ru=
dimentary
real time communication. Anyone can use these methods and glean r=
esults you do not
need one of the boxes to experiment with them. If you are=
 interested in giving them a try just
let me know I would be happy to expla=
in to you how to get started.

Hello,This is my first post to the group. My name is Ursula, and I am a =
Chicago-based writer who has written a number of books on Chicago's superna=
tural history and folklore. I just started a regular program of ITC experim=
entation a week ago today, after receiving several books from Mark Macy aft=
er he spoke at our Chicago Ghost Conference in October. Macy immediately st=
ruck me as an intensely sincere, peaceful person, and I wanted some of what=
 made him that way. I soon found out that his demeanor flows from his conne=
ction to and knowledge of the other side, which he has garnered through ITC=
. With Mark's advice to guide me, I put together a very simple setup and be=
gan recording for about ten minutes each morning at eleven. I got my first =
voice on Wednesday and, though it was a bit chilling, I was and am fascinat=
ed. This was a huge step for me because, like a lot of "ghost hunters" I wa=
s fascinated by voice phenomena but never wanted it in my own house! Previo=
usly, the thought of recording in my own home was terrifying, but now that =
I understand the bridge-building idea of ITC (as a separate thing from reco=
rding EVP at haunted sites)it's actually bringing me a lot of peace and foc=
us.My husband and I operate Chicago Hauntings tours, and we started our com=
pany in part to try to "un-haunt" some of the tragic sites in the city. We =
feel that by taking guests to the locations to tell the often covered-up st=
ories of the dead there we can help send on some of the negative energies/e=
ntities. ITC seems to really speak to this idea, in the way that it helps u=
s all grow spiritually BEFORE we pass over, so that we don't get "left behi=
nd" here when it's time to transition.Anyway, those are some of the inital =
feelings and thoughts I have as I start this program. I am eager to pick up=
 feelings, thoughts (and tips) from other experimenters. Thanks again for h=
aving me!
