You can use manual sweep (free to try) or pick up one of the radio shack radios to modify so that it does a linear scan emulating some of Franks boxes. Those cost about 25 bucks and quite easy to follow the instructions. I just posted the links to Mikes videos on youtube about how to modify those. Check recent posts. For those to squeamish to follow the videos instructions, there is also other versions that have been produced that generally do same thing which are being sold like the minibox .
