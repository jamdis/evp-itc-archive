<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>They did just about everything. I already posted what they enjoy in an  
earlier post.

I know they liked to have drove Erland crazy. They tend to pick on  
those listening to low level evp - those people who, in the beginning  
listen a lot and try to dig voices out of anything they record instead  
of just the Class A&#x27;s. They seem to really like people suffering deep  
grief as they can really have a party with them and convince them they  
are their &quot;dead&quot; child, relative, etc... I know a few AAEVP members  
who have tangled with them.

They are often referred to as &#x27;&#x27;The Demons of EVP&quot;.
