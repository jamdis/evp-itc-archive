&gt; I find this whole thing kind of humorous for some reason. Maybe that&#x27;s
&gt; just me. Maybe if I weren&#x27;t so detached from the scene, it might  
&gt; look more
&gt; serious.
&gt;
&gt; Chris Moon refers to &quot;public slander&quot;. Where has this supposedly taken
&gt; place? I don&#x27;t have hours and hours to spend looking at everything on
&gt; internet and in fact it&#x27;s tough sometimes just keeping up with the  
&gt; e-mails
&gt; I get from 60 Yahoogroups and about 20 other groups (mostly related to
&gt; amateur radio and photography and a small handful having to do with  
&gt; the
&gt; paranormal).
