Subject: [EVP-ITC] EVP questions_can anyone help ?

HI
I&#x27;m one of the quiet members here.  trying to learn from everyone.
I have activity in my home. so I purchased an RCA digital recorder
which is amazing.
I have captured several EVPs, some quite clear, some a bit too fast
so I slow it down to hear it. some are voices , some answer questions, some 
are just noises.

does anyone have experience with EVPs on digital recorders ?
I have a ton of questions...  and need advice on some of them.

thanks
Lyn
