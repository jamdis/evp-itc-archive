Just like you.  So don&#39;t act like you know what I do and do not\n&gt; know, thank you very much.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am not attacking you so back the hell off.  I made it clear that this was\n&gt; for my own own edification, for me to accept my own images.\n&gt;\n&gt; The image I ever so briefly mentioned the one posted that had several\n&gt; &quot;Faces&quot; or pieces thereof that were circled.  As for your image of the man\n&gt; peeking out, I saw nothing there.  Period.   Did I say previously what I\n&gt; thought about the quality of the images in that photo?  No.  I politely kept\n&gt; it to myself because I do not like to differ with people or to deflate hot\n&gt; air balloons.  But there you have it, that is what I saw.  And to my\n&gt; knowledge, that is the only time I have described what I have seen thus far\n&gt; in your images other than mentioning the word &quot;eyebrows.&quot;  In the one that\n&gt; had many circles, I saw one that looked like a set of lips and a chin and\n&gt; the rest I personally thought was matrixing.  Once again, did I saw this?\n&gt;  No.  But you asked for it so there it is.\n&gt;\n&gt; The whole point of my post, had you read it with a clear head.  It was all\n&gt; about my own edification, that I, and I alone, need to keep plugging in\n&gt; files before I, and I alone, make a judgement about MY images and whether\n&gt; they are real or not based upon the images they provide in contrast to the\n&gt; bulk of other files.  If you simply compare your one image with the many\n&gt; circles to the youtube file, I suspect I am correct in saying that faces\n&gt; occur with much more rarity than your circle file and that they can appear\n&gt; fully formed.  Once again, I suspect, only, and I will only be able to tell\n&gt; after time.  Sample size is everything, and I thought I made that abundantly\n&gt; clear.  The post was simply about my process of learning rather than running\n&gt; out and saying look what I found when I simply don&#39;t know what has been\n&gt; found yet because it is the first time I have played with the controls\n&gt; rather than seeing the end snapshots on another persons website.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why do you always jump on the defensive and attack every one who does not\n&gt; fall in line with you?  Not everything has to be fight or flight, Ursula,\n&gt; and not every bridge has to be burned so thoroughly to the ground.  This is\n&gt; not an attack on you or results, reread the post, and this time thinking a\n&gt; little more clearly about what is written on the page and not your own\n&gt; emotional backlash construing things in the posted text that are simply not\n&gt; there.  Had you done this, you would have seen the point of my post was not\n&gt; an attack on you, in ANY way.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tim\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sun, Dec 19, 2010 at 12:03 AM, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&lt;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=kalinu@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    oo also they only image you saw me go crazy about was the mean man\n&gt; peeking what many faces did you see??\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Sat, 12/18/10, Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@gmail.com&lt;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=tjwoolworth@...m&gt;\n&gt; &gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@...&lt;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=tjwoolworth@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: ok so im getting stuff on the spectergram\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&lt;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Saturday, December 18, 2010, 4:57 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; No, I don&#39;t think I am being too critical, but I may have expectations that\n&gt; are a little too high.  I want to take my time with this.  For my own\n&gt; understanding, I need to have a large sample size so I know not only what to\n&gt; expect to see, but what to look for.  I have seen ITC snapshots from\n&gt; programs like this that offer full faces.  I would be more inclined to\n&gt; believe in such an image as opposed to, lets say. two dark lines that may or\n&gt; may not be eyebrows.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even in your example of the towel, you get half a face.  If you have half a\n&gt; face (on the vertical plane, not the horizontal) you can extrapolate out\n&gt; what the entire face would look like.  This is something I would like to get\n&gt; myself and I would consider that evidence if it showed up in one of these\n&gt; programs.  But, if you have something that looks like a forehead and that is\n&gt; all there is, then it could also look like a rock or some other such object.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am certainly hoping for results worked into box sessions.  Directing a\n&gt; session with intent, like saying &quot;I am going to examine the sound waves of\n&gt; this communication in hopes of seeing your face.  Is it possible you can\n&gt; show your face to me now through sound? &quot; is what I am after.  If a positive\n&gt; hit like this happens, then I will be jumping for joy.  Another good example\n&gt; would be a name, lets say Tom, that occurs.  If you get a positive\n&gt; affirmation that the name you heard is present, then you try the same\n&gt; technique only you address Tom by name and get a face, that would be even\n&gt; better.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, as it stands now, the faces as they appear are random at best.  I\n&gt; would be more inclined to believe that when these faces do occur , they are\n&gt; going to occur with a lesser frequency than multiple images in a few seconds\n&gt; of audio like Ursula&#39;s example.  If this where the case, there would be\n&gt; dozens, and possibly hundreds, of faces during a ten minute session and I\n&gt; just don&#39;t think that is possible.  This is why I need to look at several\n&gt; samples to find out if this is the case or not.  If these partialized faces\n&gt; occur in multiples all the time, I would be more apt to discount it.  But,\n&gt; if they are a rarity affixed to only a few clips out of dozens, I would be\n&gt; more inclined to believe in them.  Sample size is everything.  It is like\n&gt; listening to GBC.  If you have never done a session before, you would be\n&gt; inclined to believe every stray radio signal is a communication.  Only by\n&gt; continued practice (expanding your sample size) can you start to rule out\n&gt; stray radio with any degree of accuracy.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the other hand, I am very new to this and I could certainly be wrong.  I\n&gt; will continue to plug sound into the programs and hope for the best.\n&gt;\n&gt; I really want this to work.  As you have probably experienced, when they\n&gt; want you to hear something or know something, they make it very obvious\n&gt; while communicating.  I am hoping they apply this same rigor to this new\n&gt; format to show us that they are there.  If they can, then the world of video\n&gt; and audio ITC will merge in one source and then the skeptics be damned!\n&gt;\n&gt; Tim\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sat, Dec 18, 2010 at 2:24 PM, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&lt;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    I think it&#39;s unrealistic to expect every file to have faces and images.\n&gt; These faces are often just portions, eyes and lips, some have eye brows.\n&gt; Like all of this, not done for proof, it&#39;s for emotional impact.  I have\n&gt; this woman that shows up in towels, always just half the face. Perahps you\n&gt; are being too critical? As with all spirit messages, it&#39;s what it means to\n&gt; the experiencer that matters. Expecting full faces is like expecting the\n&gt; kings english and proper grammer in all EVPs.\n&gt;\n&gt; F-S\n&gt;\n&gt;   On Sat, Dec 18, 2010 at 3:07 AM, Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@...&lt;http://us.mc1807.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=tjwoolworth@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  I saw a couple which could be construed as images in the one series you\n&gt; had from SEA, but nothing that knocked me over the head yet.  I am going to\n&gt; have to see a larger sample size before I determine if what you have\n&gt; witnessed is in fact a form or not.  I cannot accept an image as paranormal\n&gt; without knowing where it sits among the bulk of audio files.  If every file\n&gt; has multiple faces, the I would have  to say that there is nothing there.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, I will certainly keep testing with my copy and hopefully something will\n&gt; really pop for me.  I have run through about ten files (EVP and GBC) so far\n&gt; for intensive study and I still haven&#39;t got anything that I would consider a\n&gt; positive hit.  I need an actual formed face, not portions thereof, to\n&gt; consider an image real.
