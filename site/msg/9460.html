<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rees,

Audition can recover an unsaved session in case the program (or
computer) should crash.

But perhaps it was intention that the session was not saved - who
knows... paranormal phenomena are often elusive by their nature.

&gt; sure why them cpu went off, but maybe I had too much infomation then they wanted me too.( I record write on to my laptop, and I don&#x27;t use any type of digital or analog recorder).  I will prove it
&gt; again.  Tonight I am going to do everything the same to see if I can get it to happen again.

&gt;       Hey guys

&gt; I had the most amazing session last night. Me and my fiance 
&gt; did a session, and this is how it went. 

&gt; We usally do 10 min. of audio, and during the session we first 
&gt; contacted a guy named Virgil, and we got him to say both of our 
&gt; names. He said &quot;William&quot; for me, and &quot;Leigh&quot; for Ashley. We all 
&gt; communicated for the 10 min. He didn&#x27;t answer every question, but 
&gt; he answered 75% of all answerslast night. We told him that we 
&gt; wanted to prove that they exsisted on the other side. Life after 
&gt; death. He answer &quot;we are over here&quot;, very plainly. After the 10 
&gt; min. We ask for confirmation so we could shut off the radio, and we 
&gt; got this answer &quot;that would be a bad idea&quot;. Which freaked Ashley 
&gt; out. So we kept the radio on and we had a conversation with this 
&gt; preacher, then while the band was still sweeping the preacher came 
&gt; through and he talked to us (while sweeping the band), and started 
&gt; to preach to us about our side, and how messed up it is.(the band 
&gt; was sweeping the whole time, I never stop the band from sweeping) 
&gt; He said that we needed to pray for our enemies as well as our 
&gt; friends and families. He talked to us for 6 to eight minutes. 
&gt; Then we finished the session (Ask for confirmation)when he didn&#x27;t 
&gt; come through any more. We shut down. Then of course I get up and 
&gt; put everything back the way it is supposed to be. Leaving the 
&gt; session that we just did on the laptop. Then I went to take a 
&gt; shower, and I come back. The laptop was turned off and I lost all 
&gt; of the session. Sometimes the computer will log itself off, then 
&gt; when you get back it is exactly the was it was when you left it. 
&gt; But this wasn&#x27;t the case, some reason the laptop shut itself off, 
&gt; and we lost all of the evidence that we had. Didn&#x27;t have nothing, 
&gt; and I couldn&#x27;t believe that we lost everything. So thats why I am 
&gt; sitting here typing away about what happen last night. Instead of 
&gt; me posting files about what happen last night. I wish so bad that 
&gt; y&#x27;all would have been able to hear the communication. It was a life 
&gt; changing experience. It made me think a whole lot different about 
&gt; box research. I still can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t save it before the 
&gt; computer turned itself off. That is what happen to me last night, 
&gt; and change box research for me for the rest of my life.

&gt; Thanks
