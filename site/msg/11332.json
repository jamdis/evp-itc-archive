I sent you back an add request. Welcome to the group. \n\nI had a chance to check your file. Water sounds are evident. I took the liberty of putting them thru my water filter. Some interesting results. I will give that to you later if I see you on.\n\nMisty\n\n--- On Fri, 6/20/08, Ray &lt;evp_hgte@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: Ray &lt;evp_hgte@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Harrogate, Yorkshire UK\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, June 20, 2008, 2:00 PM\n&gt; Hi everyone just to introduce myself.  I&#39;m Ray from\n&gt; Yorkshire England, \n&gt; I&#39;ve been doing research into EVP for a while now and\n&gt; always on the \n&gt; lookout for improved techniques and better results.  Just\n&gt; uploaded my \n&gt; first file under Ray&#39;s File&#39;s.  I obtained this EVP\n&gt; while exploring a \n&gt; disused Lead Mine here in Yorkshire I was alone and armed\n&gt; with a torch \n&gt; and Olympus VN-120pc digital voice recorder.  If you loop\n&gt; the file you \n&gt; can hear the noise of dripping water from the roof of the\n&gt; Mine and a \n&gt; distinct voice saying &quot;help Me&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Ray"}
