I knew this was coming, you feeling\noverwhelmed with everyones thoughts and opinions. I&#39;ve watched you\nsway opinions depending on whats happening here on the boards, who&#39;s\nspeaking the loudest, etc. The fact remains that you were able to\nbuild a device that allows &quot;something&quot; to occur. It is nothing short\nof amazing.\nMy only suggestion to you on this obvious overwhelming day, is to\nremember that you and Chris met for a reason. You were guided to him.\nThe friendship has gone back and forth since but inevitably something\nhappens that validates for you the things that Chris has said. It is\nokay that you have different opinions. You both really work in\nseparate environments. Your opinions are based on your experiences in\nthe development of the devices and the group you interact with. Chris&#39;\nare based on the environments that he works in and the group that\nassists him. \nIt would be a shame to let anyones opinions, including mine, interfere\nwith your friendship and working relationship with Chris.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi All;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  I feel like I&#39;m getting pulled inmultiple directions, each wanting\nto validate, and endorse their version of the box, and/or the results.\nIt&#39;s nerve wracking, and making me nuts. I don&#39;t know what is the\ncorrect use, function, or output of the box, I know only how I use it.\nI get what most others get, and more. What everyoe else does wiht it\nis up to them. The box is an ITC devcie, my orignal use was to use for\nmy own communications. It seemed rel;ated to EVP, so i shared my\nresults on various EVP web sites, and groups. I regret that, I  wish I\nwould have kept it to myself. Humanity doesn&#39;t even understand their\nown minds, and yet they want to comunicate with the higher realms. The\nother uses, such as spirit communcation, I tend to stay away from,\nit&#39;s too unpredeictable, and you can&#39;t tell who/what is talking.\nPersonally I think 90% is your own minds talking back to you, and\ngiving what is expected.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  I&#39;ve reached a point where I&#39;ve had enough public interaction.\nEveryone wnat to beat up Moon, yet everyone wants to do the same\nfriggin&#39; things, and I&#39;m stuck in the middle.  I don&#39;t vcare about\ndemons, bad guys, or saints coming through, I have my own group that\ncomes through, and that&#39;s what the box was made for. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; You keep typing, we keep giving.
