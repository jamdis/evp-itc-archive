&gt; Ann,

&gt; In that particular file I caught maybe a word or two.
&gt; The reason I questioned the sweep rate is that the slower
&gt; the sweep rate the more likely you are to pick up full words
&gt; or even sentences of radio broadcast with the minibox.
&gt;
&gt; Plus you get that annoying HUMMM, HUMMM when the sweep is too slow.
&gt; Try adjusting the signal strength to accomidate the sweep.
&gt;
&gt; But listen if it&#x27;s working for you don&#x27;t mess with it!

&gt;
&gt; The file was slowed by 25 percent. The sweep was at about 1:30 and  
&gt; the signal strength at 12. If I turn the sweep up to 3, it sounds  
&gt; like gunfire from all the stations around here. Literally. Why do  
&gt; you think the sweep effected this? I confess that I have no clue  
&gt; what the sweep rate does. I just know that I play with it until I  
&gt; start hearing voices that seem to shout words like &quot;Purple,&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Seven&quot; and &quot;Lisa&quot; and then we&#x27;re golden.
&gt;
&gt; You really don&#x27;t hear that? I thought the majority of it was pretty  
&gt; clear. The first couple words were shaky, maybe, the &quot;We&#x27;re good!&quot;  
&gt; and &quot;Okay&quot; were loud enough that I hear it in real time and  
&gt; answered. Did you hear it differently?
&gt;
&gt; Hmmmmmm. (Scratching head.)

&gt; Hi Ann,
&gt;
&gt; I did not hear this file the way you labeled it
&gt; I think in part because you had the sweep rate on the mini box
&gt; too slow.
&gt;
&gt; You want to try and keep the sweep rate between 2 and 3 o&#x27;clock
&gt; then use the signal strength knob to adjust for the weaker signals.
