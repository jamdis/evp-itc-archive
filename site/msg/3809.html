<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>When do you get yours, Lance?

Mine is ETA 3rd week in January.

I swear to god, I feel like I&#x27;m adopting a child or something....

&gt; Good stuff!
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ve likewise been engaged in pre-Box encouragement. For instance, I
&gt; know I&#x27;m not the only one that has ideas come to them while taking a
&gt; shower. Sunday afternoon, while so occupied, a notion came strongly
&gt; over me, which is just the awaited nudge I was waiting for before
&gt; buying a MiniBox myself. I had an almost electrical feeling to
&gt; utilize a MiniBox at a shamanic studies class my shaman teacher
&gt; begun, and I facilitate now.
&gt;
&gt; You see he past away back in April and it&#x27;s my impression he wishes
&gt; for that group to try communicating with him! I&#x27;ve got both eyes and
&gt; ears open. I&#x27;m also going to ask the right sort of questions to test
&gt; whether or not is indeed the fellow.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m very hopefully but we shall see...

&gt; &gt; Congrats, Lance! :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I can&#x27;t wait to start with mine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A few days ago I, as I was driving home alone, I turned on the
&gt; tape
&gt; &gt; recorder I carry for interviews. I played it back as I was still
&gt; &gt; driving. During one part, I told them about the box and what I
&gt; wanted
&gt; &gt; them to do once I had it. I said, &quot;Talk to me, guys.&quot; Right
&gt; afterward
&gt; &gt; a male voice said, &quot;Talking.&quot; I was one big smile for an hour.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I&#x27;ve gone ahead and done it...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I purchased one of Ron&#x27;s MiniBox&#x27;s!!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; No snowball will be safe in hell now!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Tell you what, instead of asking Chris about life and death or
&gt; heaven
&gt; &gt; &gt; and hell, I plan to:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Take a training class provided freely by ASUP.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2)Engage in a little direct inquiry and testing of spirits.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Strongly encourage fearless people to find their own answers, by
&gt; &gt; &gt; doing something likewise.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lance,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think you make my point very well. You say you don&#x27;t know
&gt; Chris
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personally but that it seems I am the one wearing rose colored
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; glasses. I do know Chris. Even when Frank is upset he
&gt; says &quot;Chris
&gt; &gt; &gt; is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nice guy&quot;. Chris&#x27; statements and beliefs have never changed
&gt; while
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others can be wishy washy depending on the day. The view that
&gt; Chris
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does not want any one to research the box besides him is BS. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is that prior to Franks original yahoo group disappearing, Chris
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; provided a link directly to the schematics. In his
&gt; presentations he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would tell people that the schematics were available online.
&gt; Yet,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because he is against mass production, it MUST be because he
&gt; wants
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; research all to himself. Rose colored glasses or a case of only
&gt; &gt; &gt; seeing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what is wanted? This is a fact compared to perceptions and
&gt; &gt; &gt; opinions.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Almost each and every user of a box or it&#x27;s facsimile have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stated that lower energy/evil/dark... entities have spoken via
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; device.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Rick Moran states that the groups for testing will include
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believers, skeptics, senior citizens, (now here&#x27;s where it gets
&gt; &gt; &gt; scary)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CHILDREN and HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Couple the last two facts together and do the math. One
&gt; mentally
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unstable child or youth hears the box tell him it is right to
&gt; kill
&gt; &gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rape or .....
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Rick Moran in his article about Tools being only as good
&gt; as
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; users states, &quot;...know how they work before you go into the
&gt; field.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, in one place we are still testing, in another we are sending
&gt; &gt; &gt; them
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out in the field to be tested by groups that include children
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; high
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; school students. The good thing is that a nice little online
&gt; &gt; &gt; tutorial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is available with some warnings. Phew! As long as this can&#x27;t
&gt; come
&gt; &gt; &gt; back
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on anyone I guess all the bases are covered (tongue in cheek).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Chris has been the primary tester of the device in the
&gt; field.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That fact deserves consideration, at the very least.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Last night, a radio personality on Spooky South Coast
&gt; claimed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that after he engaged the dark voices coming through the box,
&gt; he was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physically attacked.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Frank has stated that in the beginning Chris was the only
&gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who understood how the box should be used.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Some people who have received boxes from Frank discovered
&gt; they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were not able to use them although they worked fine for Frank.
&gt; These
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same people would not return the boxes to be looked at.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: After death communications have been received via both
&gt; &gt; &gt; computers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and phones. If it were simply the devices and not the users
&gt; would we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not have millions of these communications?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Mark Macy states that in an after death communication
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication with Konstanin Raudive in which Mark asks &quot; Can
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; tell
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me about the equipment you use to produce a perfect, almost
&gt; perfect
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; voice on earth?&quot; Konstanin replies &quot;Well it depends on your
&gt; &gt; &gt; reception-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or mainly your psychic reception.&quot; This fact backs up the theory
&gt; &gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effective users are limited.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: In another after death communication Konstanin addresses
&gt; &gt; &gt; contact
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fields saying &quot;...but if there is dissonance in the form of
&gt; fears,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doubts, and animosities the contact field becomes
&gt; cloudy...that&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; when
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; negative spirit groups close to earth in vibration can break
&gt; into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; existing bridges with troubling results.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And so yes, maybe I wear rose colored glasses. However, I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; inclined
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to believe that I have done my research and have availed myself
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite a bit of information regarding this topic.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With that said, I am holding an online event where people can
&gt; ask
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris the questions they want as long as they are formed in an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intelligent manner. If you are interested in attending the
&gt; event you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can find the information on the front page of my site at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; www.thepsinetwork.com I felt it unnecessary to attempt
&gt; to &quot;bridge
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gap&quot; as well between speculation, insinuation and fact.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sincerely,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Babs

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey Bab,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even though I&#x27;ve newly begun to chime in here, it seems to me
&gt; &gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some people are guilty of wearing rose colored glasses, as
&gt; far as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris is concerned. LOL! I don&#x27;t know him personally, so I
&gt; really
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#x27;t know what really motivates him. Right or wrong, by
&gt; &gt; &gt; conducting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself in the manner he has, it&#x27;s understandable why his
&gt; &gt; &gt; approach
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has drawn the scrutiny from his peers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frankly, this entire effort is a great learning experience and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; potential healing for mankind! I encourage all of us
&gt; researcher
&gt; &gt; &gt; types
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to simply sit back, and take a deep breath or three. Consider
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together why we&#x27;re doing this. Let&#x27;s work on making this
&gt; world a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better place while we have breath...
