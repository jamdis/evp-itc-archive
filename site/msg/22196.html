<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>As others have said, i never post over here but do read it.  I am disgusted at the recent posts lately.. and not just because Steve is my brother.. 

The rants, name calling, and vulgarity that comes from you Frank is appalling. It seems to me that anyone that tries to do anything as far as making a box is shot down and no one knows what they are doing other than you.. I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would bother with you at all.. You seem to be the angriest person i have ever seen.. Not to mention, having one sided arguments.. I have been watching for days since you have thrown steve off the group and your rants toward him calling him every name in the book go unanswered.. 

Feel free to throw me off as well.. I won&#x27;t post here again.. Whatever is written on this board that you created shows no promise in anything paranormal.. Negativity will never get you anywhere..  Paranormal unity is about working together, not tearing everyone apart.. I have no respect for you, as inventor of the box or not.. Doesn&#x27;t matter.. You have to give respect to get it..
