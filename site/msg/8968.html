<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all, new comer Laura here.

I have an older version digital voice recorder.
Panasonic RR-QR 160.
I have used it for regular evp, but now want to listen to recordings on 
my computer...an hopefully post them to the group.

This model has no usb, only 2 plug in holes on top, headphones and mic.
Is there an adapter cord of a sort that I can get to run from the mic 
in the voice recorder to the mic in the computer and record? 
I&#x27;d really like to actually use it and post, etc.  

If there is not, or no one knows of an adapter, anyone know of a better 
voice recorder to get that is cheap!  lol

I am in the middle of hacking a 20-125, thanks to some help from Bruce, 
and I want to record and post what I get .....

Any suggestions anyone? 
~ Laura</pre>
