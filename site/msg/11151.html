Hi Al,
First and foremost take charge of your recording sessions in a lovin=
g & postive way. 
Also, state a prayer before starting the session or medit=
ate in a positive way.
Tell them no abusive language will be tolerated or c=
ursing, you have the control.
That will stop alot of the nasties and darkhe=
ads. Let me know.
Blessings,
LK
