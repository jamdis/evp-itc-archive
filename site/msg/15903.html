is it normally like this in chat were people talk about how they feel 
spirits where the crew is at and they see a little boy there were there 
isn&#x27;t one to be seen.

I&#x27;m open minded but that turns me off of the whole thing.

&gt;     Yep it was a blast. They had to move the chat room off of
&gt;     livestreams server because of hackers. But that will be resolved
&gt;     tomorrow most likely so we dont have to deal with those jerks
&gt;     again. It was fun! Ok almost 5am here so I am gonna go get some
&gt;     zzzzzz&#x27;s.
