Some months ago, Stefan created an allophones files (I think it&#39;s 72 speech \nfragments based on the Speak Jet chip) to use in conjunction with his EVP Maker program.  \nBecause the allophones file contains only fragments and not complete words or sentences \n(though to be sure, some fragments can sound like words, ie:  &quot;I&quot; &quot;ear/hear&quot; etc) there isn&#39;t \nan easy explanation for the responses which are produced by it ... responses that are not \nonly complete sentences, but relevant to the topic of the session.\n\nI think using the allophones file goes a long way in helping to rule out false positives.  I \nhave actually had multiple sessions where real-time communication has taken place back \nand forth between myself and the person in spirit communicating via this set-up.  :-)\n\nhttp://www.aaevp.com/examples/sound/(c)margaret_downey2008-\nconvo_with_arthur.mp3\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Leahs Odyssey &lt;leahsodyssey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Are you talking about the computer program EVP Maker from Germany?
