I think maybe the big break through will be people \nrealizing that this communication is possible.  Yeah, it&#39;s kinda srange how \nthere&#39;s a whole gourp about our age that is active in ITC.\n\nFrank\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Candi&quot; &lt;candismoo123@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] The world is catching up!\n&gt;Date: Sat, 24 Feb 2007 00:17:36 -0800\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank!\n&gt;I went to that url you listed here and I saw where you posted. Here I was, \n&gt;thinking that you were OLD, but to my surprise, you and I are the same age! \n&gt;Well, at least for the moment. I was born May 9th, 1953. So you may \n&gt;actually be older or younger, but we&#39;re both 53 right now! I find this \n&gt;amusing! I should have known! LOL Learn something new everyday! Ain&#39;t that \n&gt;the truth!\n&gt;That site I went to, about Montague Keen, was very interesting! I joined \n&gt;also! It&#39;s all very impressive! What do you think the big &quot;breakthrough&quot; in \n&gt;spirit communication is going to be?\n&gt;Thanks for the info,\n&gt;Candi\n&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: Frank Sumption\n&gt;   To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Friday, February 23, 2007 11:23 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] The world is catching up!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Yeah, there are examples on the sites I went to, not remembering now \n&gt;which\n&gt;   thery were, and the favorites that I marked are at work. I have had \n&gt;voices\n&gt;   like that too, using the crowd noise from one of our school board \n&gt;meetings.\n&gt;   There was some ghopst voices mixed in. These entities will speak with \n&gt;almost\n&gt;   anything if they know someone is/will be listening.\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://www.itcbridge.com/forum/ Here&#39;s a very interesting forum for \n&gt;EVP/ITC.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;   __________________________________________________________\n&gt;   The average US Credit Score is 675.
