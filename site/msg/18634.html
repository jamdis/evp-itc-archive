<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ll repeat it just to be clear. The two I kicked off never accepted any
evidence, ignored all examples of voices others posted, regardless of how
clear they were. Claimed all they heard was gibbersih from the boxes, yet
presented themselves as somehow more qualified to test the paranormal.
Always no data, no evidence, while ignoring everything presented.  They tend
to imply all the EVP voices were the brain trying to make sense out of
chaotic noise, nothing more. When questioned as to their motives they acuse
me of attacking them.

 I&#x27;ve been doing this stuff for ten years, and the two were pretty typical
of most debunker/skeptics who deny deny deny, ignore ignore ignore and claim
a higher intellect. I reached my saturation point.

 They wanted to quote the statement on the group home page, which in fact
states I will kick off people that appear to be debunkers.

 Other methods are fine, not methods of debunking though! The box is one
method of supplying the raw audio, just as white noise is a method of
supplying the raw audio. *My opinion* is that the spirits and entities
communicate best if they have something to make their voices out of, and the
box, aka a swept radio, provides bits of speech music and noise for that
purpose. I do not know anything about the so called paranormal, I don&#x27;t do
&quot;investigations&quot;, don&#x27;t go to haunted areas to get EVPs. I do this stuff out
of curiosity, and remain intrigued with these voices from a &quot;broken radio&quot;.
It really pisses me off to have someone who can&#x27;t hear the stuff tell me
what it really is.
