<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello,

group.

  File        : /Jim&#x27;s RR-DR60 EVP&#x27;s/review-MJ.mp3 
  Uploaded by : clockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt; 
  Description : Unloaded again-couldn&#x27;t see the first one. This has been ran through a denoise program. Sounds funny. IF you are able to hear what is on this-you will hear MJ say &quot;yes I can&quot; then a bullish kids says &quot;your talking in the last mic&quot;. I didn&#x27;t hear the kid in my original until I put it through denoise program....now his voice is MORE clear than Michaels &quot;yes I can&quot;.
