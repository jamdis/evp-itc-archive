<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah no webcast that I can see so far anyway. Tho I did check out thier forums and someone posted complaints already of not being able to get into any of the public presentations due to limited seating. Something about being turned down at the door once they had waited in line for a while. They said theres not much else going on to make it worth the money they spent. Sounds like they should have booked a bigger arena so everyone thats buying tickets at the door dont feel dumb for doing so.

So I dont know I leave it up to you to decide that one. If ya do go make sure ya start the line wherever it is ya wanna visit LOL

Yeah I&#x27;m in Orlando area =)

&gt; I&#x27;m testing the email reply, hopefully this will work...
&gt; Are you really
&gt; close by? I&#x27;m about an hour or hour and a half away.
&gt; I&#x27;m just north of
&gt; Tampa. So I&#x27;m thinking about going tomorrow. Hopefully
&gt; the webcast will be
&gt; fixed soon. I just don&#x27;t want to show up and find out
&gt; there is no room to go
&gt; to the lectures or anything. It says a 70 person capacity
&gt; for seats, and
&gt; then whatever standing room there is. That to me
&gt; doesn&#x27;t seem like good
&gt; odds, so I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do.

&gt; &gt;   Nope not makin that one I&#x27;m working all weekend.
&gt; I checked the roster
&gt; &gt; about a month ago and looked interesting if you are a
&gt; fan of some of the
&gt; &gt; TAPS members who are attending or one of the other
&gt; guests.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You live close? I&#x27;m not that far from there maybe
&gt; an hour if I get lost(or
&gt; &gt; 2 lookin for a place to park LOL)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Feeds might be cool depending on what information they
&gt; are sharing with the
&gt; &gt; public. I may check in to see if they got them up
&gt; later.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I tried sending this yesterday (Friday), but I
&gt; guess it
&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#x27;t go through. &quot;I know how some
&gt; people feel
&gt; &gt; &gt; about the TAPS guys, but is anyone going to
&gt; TAPSCON (
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://tapscon.com/ ) in Clearwater, Florida this
&gt; &gt; &gt; weekend? I can&#x27;t make it on Saturday, since I
&gt; have to
&gt; &gt; &gt; work, but I&#x27;m thinking about going on Sunday.
&gt; If you go
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the site it has a live feed (which I plan to
&gt; watch at
&gt; &gt; &gt; work) and its venue, etc. There&#x27;s going to be
&gt; all
&gt; &gt; &gt; kinds of different stuff, but I don&#x27;t know if
&gt; it&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; worth the money. I think it&#x27;d be interesting
&gt; to go
&gt; &gt; &gt; though.&quot;
