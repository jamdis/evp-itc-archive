&gt; Just so you know that all this is just personal opinions and i don&#x27;t
&gt; believe that Bruce stressed that to you in the post. Every
&gt; researcher has their own opinions on how it is done and the results
&gt; have varied amongst us. There is no way to actually explain to
&gt; someone how these devices work, i couldn&#x27;t tell you that leaving the
&gt; box on will make it imprint because there are no facts based on this
&gt; research thus far. Only personal opinions have been put out there
&gt; and what we have experienced for ourselves up to this point.
&gt; Everybody needs to do their own research with a little helping hand
&gt; from those who have been doing this a little while longer and that&#x27;s
&gt; it. You will find your own niche in this communication and teach
&gt; what you&#x27;ve learned to others one day. Just remember that nobody can
&gt; tell how it should be, because there is no proof only some personal
&gt; experiences. That covers all paranormal areas, you can believe or
&gt; not in something but you can&#x27;t prove it to others or at least i don&#x27;t
&gt; think anybody has yet??

&gt; &gt; Nick,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You are a new member and a possible researcher so I do not want to
&gt; get off on the wrong foot
&gt; &gt; It sounds like you may have taken what I said as criticism, It was
&gt; not meant to be.
&gt; &gt; Just experienced advice. There are some researchers that believe it
&gt; is beneficial to leave
&gt; &gt; a box running and unattended, so that our spirit friends
&gt; can &quot;imprint&quot; to the frequency of the box
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That is not at all necessary, Spirit techs do need to imprint to
&gt; certain boxes but do so through two way communication
&gt; &gt; you see they also imprint the energy signature of the user of the
&gt; box also. And that can only be accomplished through
&gt; &gt; communicative interaction during a session. If the box is left
&gt; unattended they may only accomplish half of what they need to do.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also I have had first hand experience with certain researchers that
&gt; do practice this lackadaisical us of a box and had begun to
&gt; &gt; get less and less communication during attempts at actual sessions
&gt; and eventually nothing but negative entities coming through.
&gt; &gt; I am not saying this is solely due to doing an absent session which
&gt; is what I have come to call it, It entails man6y factors.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But the absent session practice definitely contributes to the
&gt; ultimate failure of communication.
&gt; &gt; Nick, it is better for you to establish solid research practices in
&gt; the beginning that will serve to enhance your communication
&gt; &gt; skills and growth in the future.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Remember your spirit contacts or &quot;technicians&quot; will become not only
&gt; the facilitators of your link and communication from the
&gt; &gt; other side but they will become your trusted friends and
&gt; protectors. you would never leave your buddy on the phone and go
&gt; &gt; on to something else while he remained on the line calling for you
&gt; to speak with him. Our spirit friends where people just like us
&gt; &gt; at one time and the emotions we carry in the physical also carry
&gt; over to our spirit lives.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I hope you do not take this as preaching or criticism it is just
&gt; experience from communicating with my own techs and friends
&gt; &gt; and gathering information on what they feel and expect from us as
&gt; researchers.
&gt; &gt; Remember all we have to do is turn on a box and listen and record
&gt; their job to send the communication
&gt; &gt; no matter how short the phrase or word is a 1000x harder for them
&gt; so don&#x27;t you think they deserve a 100%
&gt; &gt; of our attention when we open the lines of communication.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also in closing let me say that my belief on &quot;imprinting&quot; of a box
&gt; is for boxes like Frank&#x27;s box and the mini box, for the simple
&gt; &gt; reason that they are individually made and each carry a slightly
&gt; different frequency range, indicative to that particular box.
&gt; &gt; The radio shack hack box on the other hand is manufactured in china
&gt; most likely on an automated assembly line so each
&gt; &gt; circuit board is exactly like the next, this being the case I
&gt; believe that when our friends imprinted on the first of the RS boxes
&gt; &gt; it was sufficient for most of the others. That is why people
&gt; experience immediate communication right out of the box.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So therefore the RS box does not need that grace period to &quot;Imprint&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; These comments and statements are my own hypothesis based on my own
&gt; extensive research with every type of box that is made to date
&gt; &gt; and I am only offering it so that it may help others to avoid the
&gt; toil and mistakes that I have endured.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; thanks for giving me the soap box once again!

&gt; &gt; Just FYI, I had stopped checking my email at that time and was

&gt; to not pay attention to the box when i turn it on.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Nick, My advice as a long time researcher is not to just turn the
&gt; box on and leave it running unless you intend to do a session and
&gt; give your friends on the other side that are workingextremely hard to
&gt; send you the communication your undivided attention. It&#x27;s kind of
&gt; like calling someone on the phone and when they start a conversation
&gt; you decide toput the phone down and focus your attention on other
&gt; things. There are other researchers that feel that there is nothing
&gt; wrong with this practice and do it on occasionBut I have come to the
&gt; understanding that it is deemed disrespectful and while you may be
&gt; listening with one ear as you do something else, you will hear a loud
&gt; curse word or nasty statement, that is their way of getting your
&gt; attention back. I have gotten numerous messages about the difficulty
&gt; of the attempts for them to communicate so when I turn the box on it
&gt; gets my full attention. just some experienced advice. As for them
&gt; telling you to close the portal, it could have two meanings.
&gt; Sometimes they refer to box thatis turned on and in use as a portal
&gt; for the simple reason that each time we turn a box on to communicate
&gt; it opens a direct open link between our realm and theirs so in
&gt; essence it is an open door for anything to pass in or out. that is
&gt; why when I end a session I always ask my technician to bring back any
&gt; spirits that may have come through the portal during the session and
&gt; I ask for conformation and 10 times out of ten will get &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;OK
&gt; THEY ARE BACK&quot; also they may have meant since you had the box running
&gt; and where not doing a actual session to shut the box so that they
&gt; could go and not have to protect the open connection from any
&gt; negative entities that where able cross through the openportal. A few
&gt; researchers have been receiving numerous messages about the number 7
&gt; within the past month. The only known significance that the number 7
&gt; has in evp research is the 7 entities that controlled communication
&gt; back in the eighties and ninetiesduring the spiricom and luxembourg
&gt; era. To receive this number in messages so often and by more than one
&gt; researcher, odiouslyholds some importance which they have not been
&gt; able or are not ready to convey. If you need any help or have any
&gt; questions please feel free to ask. Bruce

&gt; &gt; Hey,Anyone have any odd problems in the morning with using it. I am
&gt; sitting here checking my email so i just thought i&#x27;d turn it on
&gt; and... not check my email. Anywho.... Then right at about 6:20 i
&gt; heard a voice say &quot;Nicholas Etheridge please turn off the dsfnlsd&quot;
&gt; not quite sure what word it used... possibly portal. I just thought
&gt; it was weird. Also under all of the jumble and this voice speaking i
&gt; heard a deep male voice almost chanting &quot;seven&quot;. Not sure if I
&gt; actually heard this or its the want to have an excuse to stay home
&gt; and not take the HSAs.Anyway.. just curious if anyone has gotten
&gt; heard this or if they know something I don&#x27;t about using the box in
&gt; the morning.Peace,Nick
