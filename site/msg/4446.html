<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks, Mike.  :)

Have you always been this chipper, or has the ghost box and shadow 
ghost detector both driven you to Disney Land?!  LOL  Just kidding...

Now, I&#x27;ll have to get my collection built further with more sweeping 
devices...

&gt; Hey LC... Okay now you have both models and because of that... you 
&gt; are an official memeber of the Dynamic Duo Radio Shack Hack Club.  
&gt; Welcome!!!
&gt; 
&gt; And to boot, since your 12-470 has shorter battery leads, your 
&gt; batteries will no doubt last longer than mine because your 
electrons 
&gt; will not have as far to travel to the radio, where mine will tire 
out 
&gt; sooner with that extra length of copper... ;-)

&gt; &gt; OK - I just received my used 12-470 older version radio today and 
&gt; &gt; hacked it in about 10 minutes.  Works great, BUT I noticed on 
mine 
&gt; &gt; the length of the battery wires were not as generous as on Mike&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; video or the 12-469 I hacked previously.  Thus, I had to sort of 
&gt; keep 
&gt; &gt; it almost together, peering deep inside with a magnifying glass 
to 
&gt; &gt; make sure I had the correct wire (7th from top - green for this 
&gt; one) 
&gt; &gt; and somehow snip it.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I guess I am reporting this, because you really have to pay 
&gt; attention 
&gt; &gt; to the length of the battery box wires when you tear into these - 
&gt; &gt; they do vary, and are easy to accidentally detach off of the 
board.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So dummy here couldn&#x27;t even follow Mike&#x27;s great video 
&gt; instructions 
&gt; &gt; with the RS12-469.  After driving two hours to Merida, Mexico and 
&gt; &gt; then back and putting down 600 pesos (about $55 dollars) it took 
me 
&gt; &gt; ten minutes to do everything UFO Geek laid out in his video for 
&gt; &gt; hacking the radio shack box.  Cut the right pin labeled mute.  
&gt; Closed 
&gt; &gt; the box nicely.  Nothing.  Reopened the box...looked around...two 
&gt; &gt; times more...still nothing.   Not even a light or hum.  
&gt; &gt; &gt;    
&gt; &gt; &gt;   Until I figure the radio thing out, I am in the mean time 
&gt; getting 
&gt; &gt; nowhere (it seems) with the EVP Maker on my computer to generate 
&gt; EVP 
&gt; &gt; noise and using my hand recorder etc.   Wish I could try the 
radio 
&gt; &gt; sistem...any real geeks who can give technical suggestions would 
be 
&gt; &gt; greatly appreciated.  Or maybe I should just throw away my 469 
and 
&gt; &gt; start over.   Dont think RS will take it back.     geek-wanna-be,
