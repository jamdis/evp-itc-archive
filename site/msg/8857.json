Some of\n&gt; the SpeakJet allophones are diphthongs, e.g. #22 (&quot;IYRR&quot; like in &quot;Clear,\n&gt; Hear, Year&quot;), #23 (&quot;EYRR&quot; like in &quot;Hair, Stair, Repair&quot;), or #30 (&quot;OHIH&quot;\n&gt; like in &quot;Sky, Five, I&quot;). There are only 72 different allophones, so the\n&gt; probability that one-syllable words like &quot;(h)ear/here&quot; , &quot;air&quot;, and &quot;I&quot;\n&gt; appear, is relatively high.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t assume that everything that is received by this method is true\n&gt; communication. As with every method, it depends on various factors like\n&gt; meaningfulness, relatedness, length of the message, etc., if a message is\n&gt; regarded as a valid EVP.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- original Nachricht --------\n&gt; \n&gt; Betreff: [EVP-ITC] EVP Maker (allaphone file) Method Test\n&gt; Gesendet: Do, 03.

In my opinion the majority of the communication from \n&gt; &gt; this method is genuine.\n&gt; &gt; The method has produced communication including my name to me as well \n&gt; &gt; as other researchers that have gotten my name, and some of the \n&gt; &gt; statements and responses show signs of a sense of humor that would \n&gt; &gt; surely be absent in random word grouping.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Who ever is involved with experimentation of this method, will you \n&gt; &gt; please on your next session ask that if there is a spirit named \n&gt; &gt; Arthur for him not to mention his name or the list of words that I \n&gt; &gt; have posted. I suggest that this request be made verbally before the \n&gt; &gt; session as well as after.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And in the most polite manner. They seem to respond better to \n&gt; &gt; formality.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; please dedicate one session no shorter than 2 minutes to this \n&gt; &gt; experiment and post your results.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your cooperation appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
