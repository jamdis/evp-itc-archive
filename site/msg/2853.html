<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, I think it is very important to remember that most people are  
not psychologically hardwired for either/or. They have a very hard  
seeing that both can exist at once. There seem to be al kinds of  
spirits--from stuck humans to purple aliens to lost kids to pets to  
dark entities to who knows what all else. And each type has some sort  
of place it seems to thrive or dwell in or visit. For some  
researchers, only one type of spirit is the type they want to seek,  
talk to, or prove exists. There is nothing wrong with this, as long  
as they know there are other types as well. So, if a person only  
wants to be with a certain type of spirit, it&#x27;s their choice--in  
which case, that&#x27;s fine--or out of ignorance. Perhaps you can say to  
the second type of these people, &quot;You may not have been in this field  
long enough to have encountered spirits that are far outside this  
mold of (trapped or lost humans, demonic entities, etc.), but there  
are a great number of types of spirits and once you have encountered  
them, you&#x27;ll see this is not a simple question with simple answers.&quot;

&gt; can&#x27;t get past their huge egos to make teh point that it&#x27;s not  
&gt; white noise, and spirits can travel. I just had another go round

&gt;
&gt; Paranormal Experts??? Is there such a thing, are we talking about
&gt; the field that has ideas and theories and no solid evidence of
&gt; anything to back it up? It&#x27;s like being an expert at something that
&gt; you can&#x27;t prove exists in the first place. We would have a better
&gt; shot of being an expert at picking the winning lottery numbers than
&gt; proving to someone that an afterlife exists.
