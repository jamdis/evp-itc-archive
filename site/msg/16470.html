and could care less what others think.

&gt; The fact is you can never trust the recording whether it is an EVP or
&gt; Frank&#x27;s Box or a picture of a UFO.  You can only trust or not trust the
&gt; source.
&gt;
&gt; Days after the first photo, people were doctoring them.  Same with audio.
&gt;
&gt; That is why I&#x27;m more interested in things I gather myself and I really
&gt; don&#x27;t care if anyone else hears the same thing or believes me that I did not
&gt; modify it.
&gt;
&gt; I do it for my own purposes, not to convince others.

&gt;   I think asking that question, &quot;but how do you prove that fact to someone
&gt; else?&quot;, is the beginning of wisdom here.  And hopefully putting some good
&gt; minds together will come up with an answer.

&gt; I know I haven&#x27;t faked or doodledaddled with any audio of any recordings
&gt; I&#x27;ve made, but how do you prove that fact to someone else?

&gt;&gt; Everyone has their own assumptions, expectations, and subjectivity.
&gt;&gt; Scientists realize this, and that is why they use the scientific method: to
&gt;&gt; control for their own human predispositions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; On your advice, I read more of her articles.  The one on EVPS: (http://www.haunteda
&gt;&gt; mericatours. com/EVP/EVP/ &lt;http://www.hauntedamericatours.com/EVP/EVP/&gt;)
&gt;&gt; does show her presumptions, and she  presents many of the issues and
&gt;&gt; potentials for &quot;false positives&quot; that I assume all experienced EVP
&gt;&gt; researchers already know of.   But she also comments to the claims: &quot;My
&gt;&gt; response to this is…provide the evidence! &quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So that would seem to me she would be open to a well-designed test to
&gt;&gt; &quot;show her the evidence&quot;.  So I will contact her, suggest this sort of test,
&gt;&gt; and even suggest that experts from this group would help to design and
&gt;&gt; conduct the test - maybe even Frank - and let you know what she says.

&gt;&gt; Nothing. But scientific methodology implies not assuming anything - not
&gt;&gt; assuming the presence or absence of anything paranormal.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If you read this woman&#x27;s blogs, she&#x27;s already assumed there&#x27;s nothing
&gt;&gt; there before even beginning to test things.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  I was lead to believe this person had an interset in the box, and she
&gt;&gt;&gt; brought her &quot;boyfirend&quot; that just happen to be local, to our meeting the
&gt;&gt;&gt; other day. I let them &quot;barrow&quot; #63, now  I&#x27;m sure she will claim she tested
&gt;&gt;&gt; the box &quot;scientifically, and can prove it does not work.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  Karen had contacted me via e-mail requesting a meeting. I thought she
&gt;&gt;&gt; was someone off the group and has an interest in EVP and the boxes. She did
&gt;&gt;&gt; mention she was a skeptic, but I didn&#x27;t think debunker, or a professional
&gt;&gt;&gt; skeptic--wonder who pays these twits?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;  These skeptics don&#x27;t allow themselves to hear anything, yet will
&gt;&gt;&gt; proclaim that as proof the boxes and EVP don&#x27;t work, as if their hearing is
&gt;&gt;&gt; somehow better than the average persons ear. If a person doesn&#x27;t want to
&gt;&gt;&gt; hear it, they won&#x27;t, and because they can&#x27;&#x27;t hear EVP that means no one else
&gt;&gt;&gt; an either.  Yeah, real scientific!
