It would definitely be neat to have a portable "Walkman" type unit that run=
s on AA batteries. You could walk around in interesting places while listen=
ing for responses.
Would this system require a sound chamber? What circuit =
would you use as a sweep generator for varactor diode tuning?

Hi All;
   
   In my always experimenting way. I have an older digital Walk=
man AM/FM board. It use to be an AM/FM cassette, but I took the board out, =
and threw the rest away. I ran acorss the board a month or so ago while loo=
king for FM radios that I could rob parts from. The Walkman board has been =
sitting on my shelf for a couple years, I forgot all about it. I can use a =
sweep generator to sweep the tuning on both AM and FM of this Walkman. Then=
 just make an amplifier for the headphone output to drive speakers. This is=
 how I make cheap systems, albeit one of a kind. I also want to experiment =
with a diffenent method of making the sweep--get rid of the dual supply sys=
tem!
