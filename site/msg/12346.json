I now uses meters and \n&gt; lights, and alarms when the thing senses different things. But I&#39;m \n&gt; guessing I can tap into the circuits and pick a place where the \n&gt; different voltages (ever changing) are and put those into the input \n&gt; of a speaking chip.\n&gt; \n&gt; Humm...

Since I have never used one, I am wondering what are the\n&gt; &gt; similarities between the Ovilus and Frank&#39;s Box. Could it be at \nall\n&gt; &gt; possible that rather than just forming words or sounds based on\n&gt; &gt; atmospheric readings, spirits are speaking through the Ovilus as \n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; do Frank&#39;s box? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t mean to sound silly or presumptous, but I am very very\n&gt; &gt; curious!! I am looking forward to purchasing the Ovilus as well \nas\n&gt; &gt; the puck in the near future! Thanks for any feedback onthe \nOvilus!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Ovilus has the ability to form words in the phonetic mode, \n&gt; which I\n&gt; &gt; was not using. Does it have the ability to form words in the\n&gt; &gt; dictionary mode? I do not know. It would seem unlikely. Can \nspirits\n&gt; &gt; speak through the Ovilus like they do Frank&#39;s box? Maybe. Frank&#39;s \n&gt; box\n&gt; &gt; has a lot of white noise that can possibly be manipulated by \nspirits\n&gt; &gt; into giving us messages, but the ovilus has words programmed into \n&gt; it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; memory, it would probably take a lot more for entities to inject a\n&gt; &gt; word into the computer&#39;s memory than to inject a word into white\n&gt; &gt; noise. A lot of the words that are coming through that are not on \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; list is meaningless jibberish as the ovilus detects temperature\n&gt; &gt; changes and has nothing to do with the paranormal. I do not \nbelieve\n&gt; &gt; that the temperture changing could manipulate the components of \nthis\n&gt; &gt; device to the degree that would be needed to actually create words\n&gt; &gt; like it is doing. I am betting if enough people catalog words \nthat \n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; is saying we&#39;ll probably wind up with another 500 or so beyond \nwhat \n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; was supposed to be capable of. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I emailed the creator yesterday offering to send him sound files \nof\n&gt; &gt; the words I am getting so that he can properly identify which of \nthe\n&gt; &gt; 512 words these are, but so far I have not heard back from him in\n&gt; &gt; regards to this. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 10/2/08, Carol B. &lt;cbreck@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Carol B. &lt;cbreck@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] The Ovilus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, October 2, 2008, 1:12 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a puck, and I have been getting the name Seth too.

I recently got the ovilus and brought it to a \ncemetery \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field where a church burned down many years ago. I can not \nget \n&gt; too\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific without having people thinking I am making stuff up \n&gt; but it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got fairly wild towards the end of the session. For most of \nthe \n&gt; time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we were there the Ovilus seemed to be spitting out a lot of \n&gt; random\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff but it kept mentioning the name Seth. After we moved \nover \n&gt; to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field where the church was, the ovilus got a lot more active \nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started saying relevant words like cross and priest. The \nOvilus \n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MUCH more active when being used by our female member. \nTowards \n&gt; the end\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Ovilus said I am Seth, and the woman that was with me \ntold \n&gt; Seth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that she did not want to talk to you I&#39;ve heard bad things \n&gt; about you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After that the Ovilus said rather nasty things to her and she \n&gt; started\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feeling nauseous and she ripped the headphones off her head. \n&gt; Needless\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to say we ended the session and got out of there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Over the course of our investigation we found that the Ovilus \n&gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saying many words that are not on the 500 word list, so \n&gt; yesterday I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did some test recordings to see what words would come up and \n&gt; one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the first things that came up was: seth blamed rest I am not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gare demon (all in that order). Needless to say this has me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concerned that whatever seth is is still with the box so I am \n&gt; not even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; storing this thing inside of my house. I have an MP3 of the \n&gt; ovilus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saying this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also from my experience about 50% of the words it is saying \n&gt; aren&#39;t on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the list. Chris Fleming has been getting words not on the \nlist, \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Barry FitzGerald has stated that just over 50% of the words \nhe \n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; getting are not on the list. Is there really a much larger \nlist \n&gt; than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advertised or is this thing really magic? Highly doubtful IMO.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My most important question is is anyone else getting the name \n&gt; Seth out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the Ovilus? How many people use this device here?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
