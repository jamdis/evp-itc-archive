<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Wow. But good to know that Hannah went on. I have to wonder if people  
follow their bodies to the graveyard and then don&#x27;t know what the  
hell to do next. Especially kids. Examples of kid EVP in grave yards  
is so plentiful that it&#x27;s heartbreaking. Maybe they get there and  
others who are already hanging out there tell them its where they  
should stay, because they seem to have some kind of social life going  
on there, too.

One example that blew me away starts with a taper asking when anyone  
died. A male voice replies with a full date, something like,  
&quot;September 5, 1952,&quot; then a long pause, &quot;Do you think they heard us?&quot;

&gt; I always wonder what spirits are doing hanging around cemeteries  
&gt; anyway.  You&#x27;d think they would gravitate somewhere more meaningful  
&gt; than where their body was deposited, wouldn&#x27;t you?  I haven&#x27;t had  
&gt; much luck picking up graveyard EVP personally, but I do have one  
&gt; cool one.  I was standing at the door of a mausoleum where a former  
&gt; governor and his wife are entombed, and I called the wife&#x27;s name  
&gt; out loud while recording.  The response is &quot;Hannah isn&#x27;t here!&quot;

&gt; They might. From what I have heard of other people&#x27;s cemetery EVPs,  
&gt; it sounds like a lot of cemeteries are populated with people who  
&gt; haven&#x27;t made it over. I find cemetery EVP to be the most  
&gt; fascinating because they seem to offer a glimpse into a chaotic and  
&gt; not-so-pretty part of the After Life that very few are willing to  
&gt; look at. Our cemeteries seem to me to truly be cities of the dead.

&gt;&gt; I hear it all!  I&#x27;m envious of your location and all the activity  
&gt;&gt; you&#x27;re picking up.  Do you think some of these souls need help  
&gt;&gt; crossing over?

&gt;&gt; Gimme some opinions on this one, gang. The first part of the clip is
&gt;&gt; the speed it can through at. The repeat is slowed by about 70  
&gt;&gt; percent.
&gt;&gt; I hear it as &quot;Estep.&quot; I thought I had heard the word yes, so I ask,
&gt;&gt; &quot;Yes?&quot; Under my voice is the name &quot;Andrew,&quot; then &quot;I&#x27;m Stu.&quot;  
&gt;&gt; &quot;Perfect.&quot;
&gt;&gt; &quot;No..??...asshole...fucking scared.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Do you hear this as I do? I&#x27;m postulating right now that because I
&gt;&gt; live immediately across the street from a cemetery, and in a
&gt;&gt; 100-year-old sitting atop a 200+-year-old foundation and cellar, that
&gt;&gt; perhaps local dead folk who haven&#x27;t crossed are popping in during
&gt;&gt; sessions. The voice that said &quot;fucking scared&quot; I swear I heard in
&gt;&gt; another file in my folder saying &quot;scared people.&quot;
