I had the idea of an ebay store which is basically free.  Put every  
different Radio Shack radio in a separate listing with the links and  instructions.  
That way they are all covered.

Hi Kay. I think it should be a brief description on how to do all the  hacks.

12-469 old
12-469 current
12-470 old
12-820  current
20-125 current

Did I miss any? For a $1 listing fee, and no  hassles of buying product in 
advance then 
having to ship, that would be  totally worth it. Unlimited downloads (for how 
long can you 
list - 9  days?) would reach a heck of a lot more people than selling units 
at cost.  :-)
