I'm sorry who are you? I don't understand what you are talking about...why =
can't 
you go over this with a "fine toothe comb". Are you going to tell me=
 people are 
getting radio waves or cb or some crap like that? I hope not..=
.and i don't know 
how anyone can we people including myself get personal m=
essages regarding there 
family and children names etc..Please explain to m=
e how can you dispute that? 
Not only do i and others get detail infomation=
 regarding things that Know one 
would know...but they also tell you where =
you are in the house and say what your 
doing at the time...NOW what do you=
 need to belive this?
