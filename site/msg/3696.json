Do not allow children under the age of 16 to use this device\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Although individual sessions are effective, group sessions are more\n&gt; productive.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. This is not an &#39;electronic Ouija board&#39; - no harm can come from\n&gt; using it.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. Some voices will use coarse language so be prepared for it.\n&gt;\n&gt; 5. Always use a recorder to tape all sessions\n&gt;\n&gt; 6. Keep a notebook with the times and locations of your sessions.\n&gt;\n&gt; 7. The MiniBox will call you by name so don&#39;t be startled by it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lance\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\nWell, so much o he \"Oh Noes!1!!
