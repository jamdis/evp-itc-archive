Use the Speakjet data sheet to configure that\n&gt; chip. I just float the SJ&#39;s reset pin--not connecting it to anything,\n&gt; the idea being that entities can use that to control the chip because\n&gt; you can wave your hand over the reset pin and the chip will reset,\n&gt; announcing &quot;Ready&quot;.\n \n&gt;  Frank-S"}
