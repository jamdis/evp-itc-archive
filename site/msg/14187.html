Admittedly I do not know much about bit-level comparisons, what they can or=
 can't show so I will have to leave that to you. I have doubts because I wo=
rry once a file's integrity has been messed with, I wonder that even though=
 the bits match, maybe that doesn't mean they are the same quality as the o=
riginal. I really don't know though what is possible or impossible when it =
comes to this area.

"It is probably possible to set up an email compressio=
n scheme that does do lossy audio compression.  My tests show my setup does=
 not.  If you'd like me to help test your setup, we can do that too. From w=
hat I see, lossy compression from an attachment would be very unusual."

Th=
e problem I have is that not just from Jon, but I have heard it from other =
people, and a professional and they all said that loss is possible. From al=
l that, my conclusion was that maybe in some cases loss was possible.

Howe=
ver, your arguments do put doubt back into my mind, which pisses me off, be=
cause I had originally argued feverishly for no loss, then I heard differen=
t from different sources and decided to do what I thought was the right thi=
ng by contacting a third party professional. So after all that, I decided I=
 was licked and had to eat crow.

Now I am back at square one, from the oth=
er side LOL!!! Computer people have been wrong in the past.

compression.  My tests show my setup does not.  If you'd like me to help te=

an attachment would be very unusual."

I have not tested it from my compute=
r, as I haven't had any problems with loss. I would really like to have Jon=
 work with us on this, because he was the original person who told me I was=
 wrong.

But I will test it from my side. I will send a wav file to one of =
my other addresses. Then I will download and compare. If I think I hear a d=
ifference, then maybe I can have you do a bit-level comparison on the files=
.

Either way, I am going to get to the bottom of this.

        Yes you can tell loss of quality by a bit-level comparis=
on.  An audio file is just a file of bytes, that is later interpreted by an=
 audio player.  Two files with the exact same contents, whether they are au=
dio or image or a dababase or an exe, are indistinguishable from each other=
.  That is, if I copied the contents of one to a new file, and the contents=
 of the other to a new file, and asked you which file each came from, there=
 would be no way to tell.  Even the audio player could not tell.  The data =
is identical, and so the sound (or the picture, etc) would be identical.

 =
       Yes I did listen to the results, but that is not the best test (they=
 sounded identical, but that is a subjective opinion).  The real test is co=
mpring the contents.  Identical contents means indentical data, means ident=
ical audio.

        It is probably possible to set up an email compression=
 scheme that does do lossy audio compression.  My tests show my setup does =
not.  If you'd like me to help test your setup, we can do that too. From wh=
at I see, lossy compression from an attachment would be very unusual.

                    For executables, you may =
be right. However, for wav files, the compression during email is not loss =
less. 

                    I used to think as you do, in that the emailed =
attachment of a wav file would not loose anything. After a lengthy discours=
e with another member here, I learned that I was wrong. The reason why I di=
d not realize it in the first place is that when I would email a wav file, =
I would intentionally keep it in very small segments, to keep file size dow=
n. This was just for ease of transfer. But because of this, I had not exper=
ienced any noticeable loss.

                    Now it may be in some case=
s, depending on the servers or what have you that the file goes through, th=
at the loss may be less or more. But once the attachment is downloaded, the=
 quality has been found to be less then the original wav.

                =
    Again though you can only really tell when the wav file is large.

                            The kind of compr=
ession that occurs during an email attachment is "lossless": it compress th=
e file cleverly without losing information.  For example, if I had a progra=
m in some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it could compress it.  But =
if it lost even one bit, the resulting exe file would not execute again aft=
er it was uncompressed on the other side.

                            This=
 kind of compression does things like looking for common patterns in the fi=
le, and replacing them with a token.  A rough example would be if it found =
"Howdy Neighbor" in a file 20 times, it could replace all the occurances wi=
th say $HN1.  And also write a little dictionary in there someplace that sa=
ys "$HN1=3DHowdy Neighbor".

                            When the file gets=
 to its destination it can be uncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are =
replaced with "Howdy Neighbor".  So it was compressed (instead of 14 charac=
ters each, it only needed 4, plus the dictionary), but lost no data.

     =
                       Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not lossless.  =
Depending on the level of compression, some level of data is lost, and so c=
annot be recovered or reconstructed later.

                              I recently found this out. When y=

              =
                So even if you have attached a wav. file, it will loose res=
olution over the email process. It will not sound exactly the same as the o=

are attaching. If it is a very large file, it will sound much different.

 =
                             The only exception to this is if the wav. file=
 is small enough that the filtering process will ignore it. It has to be pr=

                              The best way to share files over the inter=

                                Pixel=
ization doesn't clean-up the data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking a pictur=
e of a field of flowers, and beginning to add levels or pixelization to the=
 picture.  Soon, you would not be able to tell there were flowers there at =
all.  You would see a lot of colored blocks.

                             =
   Or in the other direction, imagine you are looking at a competely random=
ize bunch of pixes on your screen: a complete screen of truely random stati=
c snow.  Pixelizing this, after a while, you would again start to see color=
ed blocks.

                                What's happening is that it is =
processing an area of the image, taking (for instance) the average value of=
 that entire area, and replacing all the blocks in that area with the avera=
ge.  In video processing, this would result in a field of multi-colored flo=
wers being replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish block, with no r=
esemblance to flowers.  In the noise example, it maybe replace all the rand=
om pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.  If you did not know befor=
ehand what the original picture was, you couldn't tell whether your pixeliz=
ed image was really a field of flowers, a chevy, the sky with clouds, or a =
random bunch of pixels.

                                It works the same =
with the sound files.  Taking something as complex as speech, and replacing=
 frequencies with their averages, loses the speech the farther you go, unti=
l you head strange fluctuating square waves.  Doing the same to random stat=
ic will eventually produce the same thing.  And random fluctuating square w=
aves can sound a bit like speech - or at least, you could have fun sharing =
with each other what you thing they 'sound like'.

                                Be a bit careful of formats like =
mp3 if you are doing a detailed analysis of the sounds though.   While some=
 formats (like wav) can store the audio very close to the way it was record=
