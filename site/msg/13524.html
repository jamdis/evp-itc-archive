<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>i copied this from a site I found: 


When I had first heard of the Ovilus device and what it purported to do, I could not help 
but laugh out of complete skepticism. I have always doubted claims that such paranormal 
communication devices actually work. At best, I thought them to be products of wishful 
thinking and at worst, pure hokum. When I was finally able to test out the Ovilus, I was 
stunned at how well it worked and performed in the field.

The Ovilus is one of many paranormal field experimental devices created by Bill 
Chappell, a retired electronics engineer and the founder of the digitaldowsing.com 
website. He states the device works by measuring changes in the &quot;environmental&quot; 
energy fields around it. It modulates the energy changes into audible speech using a 
synthesizer chip, an extensive English word dictionary, and a function that phonetically 
sounds out words. Mr. Chappell calls this process ECM or &quot;Environmental 
Communications Mode&quot; and states his devices do not employ any arbitrary techniques to 
produce results such as random generation, sweep functioning, or programmed 
algorithms.

The Ovilus is a small, lightweight device that is portable enough to be taken anywhere 
during an investigation. It is powered by a 9-volt battery and has two audio-out jacks so 
headphones, external speakers, or audio recorders can be used simultaneously with the 
device. The Ovilus also features a bright array of LED lights to graphically display various 
readings, a feature useful for low light use.

The device has seven modes of operation. It includes a dictionary mode containing 512 
stored words, phonetic mode (sounds out words by syllable), a combination mode (both 
dictionary words and phonetics) and a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; mode. It also features an 
electromagnetic field (EMF) mode that verbally outputs EMF levels in milligauss, a level 
mode that only graphically displays EMF levels, and a dowsing mode that simulates 
virtual dowsing rods.

I assume at this point, the reader is still fairly skeptical about the effectiveness of such a 
device. I was initially doubtful too. However, after working on an investigation with Keith 
Age of the Louisville Ghost Hunters Society (LGHS) who had brought an Ovilus along with 
him, my skepticism began to wane. I must admit, it took some time to adapt to the 
device&#x27;s primitive &quot;speak-n-spell&quot; like voice and I found myself initially unimpressed. 
However, when it began repeating words relevant to the history and events specific to 
the location we were investigating, I was shocked! On another floor of the investigation 
area, it performed just as brilliantly stating unique location appropriate words.

After that experience, I began to warm up to the device and decided it might be a good fit 
for our team. We ordered the Ovilus through Bill&#x27;s website and gave it a trial run on our 
own investigations. We found the Ovilus very easy to use and it performed so well, we 
added it to our arsenal of critical research equipment used on every investigation.

From our use in the field, we have noted some tips and precautions with these devices. 
The Ovilus and other communication devices from Bill Chappell and Digital Dowsing may 
attract a range of paranormal activity attempting to communicate. As such, we have 
witnessed that the devices are capable of generating unexpected and sometimes 
disturbing speech or text. With this in mind, they should not be used around or by 
children, anyone suffering from mental illness or emotional trauma, or around those who 
are easily offended. One must definitely give careful consideration to the use this device 
around clients who may not want or need to know the information being imparted. 
Furthermore, it should be considered that paranormal realms are not always the safest 
and involvement can bring hidden psychological and physical dangers. I always 
recommend that those who attempt any type of spirit communication should first protect 
themselves with their own faith or spiritual beliefs.  

Use of this device requires rationalism and common sense. With only 512 dictionary 
words and 71 phonetic syllables programmed in the Ovilus, some results from the device 
can be attributed to coincidence and the odds of it saying something contextually correct 
are statistically probable. A good investigator should always collect multiple sources of 
evidence in an investigation that, when combined, may determine if the output of the 
device is coincidental or not. Furthermore, researching the history and past events of 
the locations where the device is being used also aids in validation.

We feel the Ovilus is a &quot;must have&quot; device of value to any paranormal investigator 
desiring to gain an edge in researching the paranormal and it appears we may not alone 
in our assessment. Having been featured in several prominent magazines, radio shows 
and movies, Bill Chappell&#x27;s devices are gaining the attention of the entire paranormal 
community.

We have certainly been converted by Mr. Chappell&#x27;s visionary inventions. As we gain 
more experience with the device, we plan on writing a more in-depth review of results 
we get in the field.  If interested in learning about the Ovilus and his other devices, visit

&gt; well me and Laurie have talked about something like this, I would like to
&gt; see a test of it, I guess it is fairly new?

&gt; 
&gt; hey guys, i&#x27;ve been thinking about investing in an &quot;OVILUS&quot;. Have any of you
&gt; used one? can you give me your take on the pros and the cons of this device?
&gt; thx!
