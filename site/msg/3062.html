Steve, thanks for the response.  To go into depth regarding addition EVP is this scenario.  Video taping a session with the box, capture evp on the video recorder and thus your so called Dead Heads come thru.  The evp I initially captured was prompting me a warning so I believe that vulgar language was about to come thru.  I have the audio and video for these, but didn't want to post them without permission from Frank or the moderators, because of the cursing.  If its ok, I will be more than happy to post them or I could send them to anyone under separate cover.
   
  I'm always interested in what people's theories are their intake on the messages.  I think in this instance the dead head was upset and didn't want to let the other speak.  He assumed that the cursing was going to scary people, little did he realize that I was a Corrections Office in the State of Illinois, therefore my mouth could be just as bad, lol.
   
  Thanks for your input!

          Juli,

Question one i believe it all depends on your radio signal at the 
time it was recorded, weather can affect transmission on both 
sides. Also, it depends if the audio was an outright message or if 
it was put through several programs on the computer to dig it out. 
At that point it could have been nothing turned into something with 
the software out there today. Second question, i'm not really sure 
what you mean but i have gotten additional Evp's on the recording 
afterwards that did not come out of the box at the time and i didn't 
hear it. White noise does attract them. Your third question is a 
good one, i used to get into arguments all the time until i figured 
out it was the dark heads coming through trying to get you upset in 
some way. If you learn to block them out, it helps communication. 
If you don't, they win and you don't get any good research in.
