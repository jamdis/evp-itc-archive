<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think it was the echo box, instead of aluminum foil, I use soft steel from 
a computer box, and I made it a wave guide echo box.

With my latest attempt, I did not even put in an echo box, all there is 
jacks for for it, so I can experiment. It seems like the box has to be 
flexible so as conditions change, so can the set up.

&gt;#13 is the coolest looking one i&#x27;ve seen so far, looks straight out
&gt;of a 50&#x27;s sci-fi movie.  I would maybe leave the plug on there too.
&gt;They may be able to come through clearer with all that current
&gt;running through it from the outlet.  It&#x27;s as if they have more
&gt;options, but nobody is really sure how evp works really.  They feed
&gt;off energy and it just seems like you would have more current from a
&gt;wall socket than a couple of batteries.
