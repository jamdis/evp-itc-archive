<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I love how their website says, &quot;This is a tool for use by experienced paranormal investigators only.&quot;  I think it should be the goal for almost EVERYONE to have a ghost box.  As long as they are brave enough, and not prone to mental problems or extremely sensitive, I think it would be great if everyone could have the experience of knowing -- absolutely knowing without question -- that there is something else out there.  Sure, some negative stuff can happen, but think of the possibilities of what we could learn if everyone had one of these things.  I&#x27;d think the positive would far outweigh the negative.  Either way, to say that the box should be in the hands of only a few, seems extremely arrogant to me.

&gt;  None of these crackheads out there ever ask me anything,  any input, or
&gt; technical advice. Always they want to act like the onlyest freaking
&gt; worldwide experts with the box. Coletta will not even acknowledge an e-mail
&gt; from me, guess he&#x27;s afraid I&#x27;ll contradict his expertness. Way too many of
&gt; these presumptuous ego driven dorks out there on the web. All seeking the
&gt; fame and fortune, not knowledge.
