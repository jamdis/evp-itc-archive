<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Easy to claim one is all modern and sophisticated, that all is known, there
are no demons, gods,or angels. Easy to forget, modern man doesn&#x27;t know
squat! All your science, all your universities, all your &quot;logic&quot;--nothing!
Y&#x27;all don&#x27;t know anythin&#x27;!

 Awhile back I had an experience where I was awakened in the middle of the
night to what seemed to be some entity crawling up inside my body starting
at my feet, accompanied by weird visions/hallucinations, unable to move.
Easy to dismiss as dreams, maybe a bit of undigested beef-to quote scrooge,
but none of my usual protection stuff worked, till I thought &quot;Jesus!&quot; The
thing lifted it&#x27;s head and took off. I&#x27;m still not a believer, but I&#x27;m not a
total rejector either. There has been times when I needed &quot;His&quot; help, and
was answered, plus, what I guess were angels, in open air &quot;Frank, He heard
you&quot;. I don&#x27;t believe in the church crap, but God is out there!  Not only
that, is been &quot;:scientifically&quot; -as close to -proven as possible-- that the
Shoud of Turin is in fact waht it appears to be--Jesus! Same question, what
the hell kind of evidence will you find acceptable?

 Some here will still insist all is known, and they are in fact the most
advanced being the universe has ever seen--they have a great deal to learn!
I try to tolerate their arrogance, but my patience is gone for that stuff.
When they get over their name calling, maybe they will be allowed to post.

&gt;   Snowfire, if i was dead (passed on) and was able to by happenstance come
&gt; across you and the evp device and you asked me the question, what makes you
&gt; think I know what I am talking about? Because I would tell you that their is
&gt; no antichrist, no devil, no anthropomorphic hebrew savage god who commands
&gt; his people to murder children and women in one town and in the next town
&gt; kill all but virgin girls (old testament).
&gt;
&gt; I would say that there is only consciousness, not confined to any man made
&gt; religion.

&gt; this one is very scary, I have not cleaned it up, I was asking about the
&gt; antichrist, and if he was released yet, and they are saying, &quot;yes, he has
&gt; been released, yes, he has, and that Christ is coming.&quot;  Please, don&#x27;t
&gt; get left here, just believe in what JC did, and don&#x27;t be left behind, &quot;the
&gt; teleport is going to be instantaneous, &quot; we won&#x27;t feel a thing, one minute
&gt; you will be sitting at a desk, next minute we will find our self in some
&gt; grassy field is what I was told.  I have more, I haven&#x27;t cleaned them up
&gt; yet, but you can see how plain and clear they are from that newer RS that I
&gt; messed up the other day.  They are saying scary things on it, they said, he
&gt; is not the devil, that the antichrist is a &quot;spirit energy&quot; &quot;worse then the
&gt; devil,&quot; and will &quot;infect&quot; posess some person after Obama.
