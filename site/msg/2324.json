The distributor out of Florida marked them way up on eBay \nand limited distribution to himself until the sensation ceased and he \nhad made a pretty penny.  It&#39;s an old unit to boot.  It is nothing \nmore than an EMF meter with sensitivity lights in place of a meter \nfrom what I understand.  So if one sees a spike in EMF waves, some \nghost hunters ask a question in the same area and watch for a spike \nas &quot;Yes.&quot;  No spike as &quot;No.  I believe this is what I heard, but I \nmay stand to be corrected if in error.\n\nLC\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I saw on Ghost Hunters last night that they were using a &quot;K2 Meter&quot; \nto get yes-no answers from the unseen. I never heard of that meter \nbefore. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Invite your mail contacts to join your friends list with Windows \nLive Spaces.
