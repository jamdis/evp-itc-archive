<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>One of the reasons I believe the researcher is often part of the
process is because some investigators seem to be able to consistently
obtain evp&#x27;s while others are not, despite many attempts over years of
investigating. Sometimes the teams in CA refer to those who often get
decent results as &quot;evp magnets&quot;. 

I think the individuals who can easily obtain good results (no matter
where they are) may be able to channel their psychic abilities into PK
energy and record the results as an evp. I&#x27;m not suggesting this is
what happens every time but it may be what&#x27;s happening in some of the
cases.

&gt; Hi Tracy,
&gt; 
&gt; If you study human agent poltergeist cases of psychokinesis, the 
&gt; identified human agent is always in the house of structure when the 
&gt; objects move.
&gt; 
&gt; The famous Miami Hotel case that Dr. William Roll investigated is a 
&gt; great example. When a certain kitchen worker was present, all sorts 
&gt; of objects were thrown around the room. When he was not there, 
&gt; nothing happened. When he left the Hotel for good, no more activity 
&gt; was ever recorded.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to try to rule out, or, support the theory that we are 
&gt; not, or that we might be imprinting EVP&#x27;s on audio tracks or tape.
&gt; 
&gt; My own personal experience in EVP gathering leads me to believe that 
&gt; this is phenomena driven, not my subconscious mind.
&gt; 
&gt; But now I have to try and find out the truth for myself.
&gt; 
&gt; This last year we saw an incredible amount of EVP&#x27;s being recorded 
&gt; during our cases we investigated.

&gt; The above is our link to our new EVP gallery if you would like to 
&gt; listen to them. These were all recorded in the last year using  
&gt; multiple recorders in each location. There is a Grade A and a Grade 
&gt; B icon to seperate them.

&gt; &gt; I am not sure this would still rule it out.  I don&#x27;t think 
&gt; psychokinesis is restrained by walls, the mind isn&#x27;t restrained by 
&gt; walls whether human or deceased.  I am guessing that psychokinesis 
&gt; behaves similar to telepathy....
&gt; &gt;    
&gt; &gt;   I believe many evp&#x27;s are deceased spirits, but the question on 
&gt; whether it could be a living person imprinting the evps was 
&gt; certainly one that made me really think !

&gt; &gt;               Hi James,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Back when I still investigated haunted sites, our team did this on 
&gt; various occasions within a house where we recorded several hours of 
&gt; activity over a few years (a long term investigation). We would 
&gt; leave our audio equipment recording in several &quot;hot spots&quot; all over 
&gt; the house and then leave for an hour or two. I have to say, in our 
&gt; experience we never got an EVP while we were out of the house. As a 
&gt; matter of fact we had an EVP when we reentered the house 
&gt; saying, &quot;here they come, lets go&quot;. I don&#x27;t necessarily understand 
&gt; why a ghost or spirit would talk with no one present to receive the 
&gt; message unless during setup you explained what you are trying to 
&gt; accomplish and what the spirits roll is in the experiment (we never 
&gt; tried explaining). A piece of machinery (recorders) in an empty room 
&gt; does not have a consciousness or spiritual presence I would be 
&gt; interested to see if you get different results.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] EVP Experiment planned in October.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;     To try and rule out that the EVP researchers are imprinting 
&gt; voices 
&gt; &gt; psychokinetically on audio players mistaken as ghosts voices, I 
&gt; will 
&gt; &gt; pre-tape an interactive evp session.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I will record a bank of thirty questions, 20 seconds of silence 
&gt; &gt; after each question, on a cassete tape and played on a cassette 
&gt; &gt; player that will be utilized in all three buildings in a known 
&gt; &gt; haunted location just outside of Phoenix, Arizona.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There will be digital recorders, cassette recorders, omni 
&gt; &gt; directional microphones, condensor microphones, as well as an 
&gt; &gt; electrocet boom microphone present in all of the sessions. There 
&gt; &gt; will be no human agents in the buildings when these sessions take 
&gt; &gt; place.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My hope is to:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Record an authentic EVP with no human agent in the building. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If this is phenomena driven, will the phenomena communicate by 
&gt; &gt; responding to questions from a machine rather than a human agent? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you have any ideas to enhance this experiment, please feel free 
&gt; &gt; to let me know. This experiment will take place on October 27th.
