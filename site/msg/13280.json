I enjoyed getting to hear what\neveryone else sent in, as well as what your results were. I am curious\nas to whether or not you got full participation once you sent out the\ndebris. Did everyone follow your instructions? Did you get files from\neveryone you send debris to? Did you get better or worse results than\nyou expected? Would you attempt something like this again?\n\nI was very excited to participate in the research and am planning on\ndoing more with the debris in the future. Just wanted to say &quot;thanks&quot;\nand keep up the great work. I think your experiments and willingness\nto share your work are a shining example to all in the paranormal field.\n\nI hope everyone enjoyed this as much as I did. I plan on doing a write\nup on our website about the experiment in the near future. I&#39;d like to\nhear from the other researchers on their experience with this project..."}
