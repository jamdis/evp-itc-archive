I have one of a handful of the Edison Autobiography that=

had that version of the biography recalled and reissued it without the last=
 chapter.

Anyway in this last chapter, Edison alludes to a way to communic=
ate with the dead but he never says he did it.=A0 He simply hypothesizes on=
 how it could be done and the fact that the dead are just on a different wa=
velength than the living.

Sorry, no links...=A0 This is from that old fash=
ioned thing called a book :))

I can tell you how to find your own copy tho=
ugh if you wish.=A0 I need to find the actual page count from my copy but I=
 went to amazon's used books and asked every seller how many pages their co=
py was.=A0 The first one to respond with the correct (bigger) number, that =
was the one I
 bought.

Don

PS but don't spend alot.=A0 The info in the la=
st chapter is not worth much.

            I suppose ultimately, it doesn't really matt=

I have also heard varied claims: that Edison did make this box; that

If you have a link to where you got your information from his
