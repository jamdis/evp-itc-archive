It was also a\ngreat treat to spend what little time we had with Frank. It was an\nenlightening experience all the way around. \n\n~April\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rosemary_guiley&quot; &lt;reguiley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I was at The Stanley Hotel in Colorado last weekend, and was excited to\n&gt; get to work with the new Mini-Box built by Ron Ricketts.   I was also\n&gt; happy to meet Frank for the first time!   I had several sessions with\n&gt; the Mini-Box with April and Allen Slaughter of the Association for the\n&gt; Study of Unexplained Phenomena, and found it quite impressive.  Very\n&gt; compact, long battery life (and rechargeable) and good clarity.  &quot;Seven&quot;\n&gt; came through for me in every session.  We had a session with Mark Macy,\n&gt; and a short one with Frank -- wish it could have been longer.  I&#39;m\n&gt; getting one of the first of these boxes, and it will be a valuable\n&gt; addition to the two Frank&#39;s Boxes that I&#39;m working with.\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t reviewed the recordings yet, as I just got home.  But we got\n&gt; many clear responses to questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rosemary\n&gt;"}
