<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, I didn&#x27;t realize the sweet pup was injured that bad. I never
would of relayed that story about my own dog Benny had I realized that
and hopefully I didn&#x27;t seem insensitive. -Bill

&gt; Well, you just keep bonding with the poor baby. The aliens are just  
&gt; jealous and they need to suck it up. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; She needs surgery, too?

&gt; &gt; Yeah, life sucks sometimes! We were hoping to get a loan to pay for  
&gt; &gt; her leg surgery, but that&#x27;s a no go.

&gt; &gt; Oh, the poor sweet baby.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; She looks rather purple in this picture, Frank.

&gt; &gt;  I carried this dog around all day, she only weighs 3 or 4 pounds.  
&gt; &gt; she&#x27;s the one that fell off that bed last night. I think my guys  
&gt; &gt; were concerned about her bonding to me too much---to late!
