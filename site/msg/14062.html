Hi Frank,
It was spirit that told us in 68 that you would build us a "box," a  watch 
like thing in order to talk with our loved ones."  <g>  I  will pay you for 
one if you want, I would love to speak with my loved ones over  there if you 
don't mind.  Are you not the inventor of the "Frank's  Box"?  If so, You 
need to get a paten going ASAP, I am not sure who has  done what around this 
stuff but, they told us it would be a Frank working with  Mr  T. A. Edison 
that would be the inventor, is this not you?  If not,  I apologize, since I am 
new here, I know there is one other man who has since  crossed over, he 
worked closely with Mr Edison as well.  What you folks  might do is to get 
together, create a group sharing paten on your inventions,  with all the people 
that are doing the testing's. you would all need to see a  lawyer probably 
to have one drawn up.  This way someone cannot come and  steal your hard 
work, because when this is perfected, it going to be a big  deal.  It will have 
something to do with a "cell."  I am a  Christian Spiritualist, and I look 
forward to having one of these, everyone will  be once you guys do the work, 
don't allow some other group to steal your hard  work away. Just a thought, 
sf

IMO, who cares? All that matters is that  you are getting something out of 
it. Besides, maybe it isn't meant to be  understood by certain people. I 
have always held the opinion that we will  never scientifically prove anything 
we do in the paranormal field, and I  think that is no accident. I think 
some people will never get anything out  of it, while others will excel in 
their knowledge, but it will be all very  personal.
 
It's all about what constitutes  enough proof for you personally. You have 
to go with your gut on what  is true spirit communication, and what isn't. 
If no one ever agrees with  you, so what?

I was just sayin'!  So why would anyone in this field  completely ignore 
methods that work, irregardless of whether science  accpts it? That's the 
thing, say anything and I'm the one being negative.  Question these other 
experts and I'm being negative--on and on. 
 
 Same old story--don't accept the evidence, don't accept that  that 
someone-like me-does in fact at least understand what conditions to  create to make 
these communications possible. Yet y'all wonder why I have  a case of the 
ass all the time. All the pompus self proclaimed egotisical  little dweebs 
out there chasing the damn fame and fortune--not  facts.
 
 I have gotten so much friggn' voices that can't be  explained as anything 
but spirits/entity communication-voices that can't be  

You hear that crap(any proof...) from every  scientist/debunker-from every  
scientist/debunker-<WBR>-well if the evidence was there we'd be the first  
to celibrate it-yeah right, rihgt after they burned, burried, and debunked  
it. There is more than eno  
 
 The stuff is simple-provide something for the enitities to make  their 
voices out of and they will speak, no friggin' mystery, no magic, no  secret 
tecnology, no high priest(ess) needed.

Frank, I think you misunderstood or misread something somewhere. The  
AAEVP/Sarah Estep Research Fund is not for AAEVP to do the research,  it's for 
them to fund OUTSIDE organizations for THEIR scientific  research on the study 
of EVP. The Windbridge Institute received some of  this sponsor money for 
what they called "Real-time EVP Conversations: A  Pilot Study." The method 
for this communication was *not* based on radio  sweep, nor traditional 
methods, so it's not based on what I assume many  people here are doing. And in 
fact, it *was* based on the creations of  someone outside of the USA, so I'm a 
little confused as to why all the  hostility toward AAEVP for putting up 
the money.

Sadly, radio  sweep methods don't, and may not for a long time, get the 
respect of the  scientific community that it deserves (then again, seems no 
form of EVP  does), but at least this current research is a step in the right  
direction. I hope, when Windbridge concludes their study, that it will  
support the notion that there is apparent communication formed in ways  that 
cannot be explained by currently known and understood laws of  nature. THAT 
alone, in my opinion, would be a big plus for all ITC  communities, regardless 
of the method from which that communication was  received. What's the old 
saying? "It takes but one white crow to prove  all crows are not black." Any 
proof, derived from any EVP method, would  be greatly welcomed as far as I'm 
concerned.
