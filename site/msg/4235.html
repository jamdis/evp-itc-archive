 Well, when ya get someone giving seemingly valid reasons why these new me=
thods are invalid, or questionable, then I turn on the RS hack rig, and "th=
ey" are singing "Purple" across the band, and then the scan starts again at=
 the bottom of AM with "DO NOT---QUIT----GROUP" (the --- indicate gaps with=
 no broadcasts or voice fragments), I'm supposed to believe that's just my =
imagination, that these things don't work. The fact is all these methods wo=
rk, and they have in fact been used long before the box. 
 
 This "Research=
er" I was arguing with yesterday no doubt thought he had me convinced, and =
on his side. I can't go there after I get clear, coherent, meaningful messa=
ges with these other methods. I would like to keep the disaggreements frien=
dly, and the discussions friendly, and I do consider the opposing viewpoint=
, but it just doesn't hold water in the case of these alternate radio metho=
ds. That's why no interviews, and no in person meetings--as such, I can be =
put into a postion of sympathy with a person when I don't actually agree. I=
t's called lack of assertiveness, and I did in fact fail assertiveness trai=
ning in the community college! As soon as the meeting is over though, I'm g=
oing to tell ya to bite me, and do my own thing anyway. 
 
 I think we all =
have to be very careful when critisizing someone's work here, research, or =
comments--in public. So far very little of the EVP stuff can be considered =
hard evidence, it's all what they call anecdotal, or it's what one or more =
witnesses experienced, but it's not repeatable--pretty much. Or you can't g=
rab someone off the street, have them listen to voices and expect they'll h=
ear it. 
 
 I can't say my results are anymore valid than anyone else's' bu=
t I also can't accpet that anyone else's results are more valid than my own=
. I am an independent researcher, I do this work on my own, it's more like =
just a hobby. I don't sell anything, and I make nothing by endorsing other =
products. When I say the Mini Box works, and the Radio Shack hack works, th=
at is the honest thing to do, it's not cuz I get a kick back, as I get noth=
ing in return, except to know I did the right thing. 
 
 As for this other =
"Researcher", I don't know what to tell ya. I can only ask, give us some fr=
iggin' credit! There's some good peole here, and to dismiss us, and all or =
our results is extremely insulting.
 
 As for the possiblities of danger wi=
th this research, I've been thinking about that. First I don't know of anyo=
ne else that has had any problems directly related to box use, and or paran=
ormal work fro that matter.  It's like listening to some bible thumper swea=
ring the devil is really right there, just waiting to jump down your throat=
, and yet, there's..... nothing. So far it's more threatening to cross the =
street every morning (I usually walk to work). 
 
 I pretty much work by my=
self, I like it that way, and sharing what I get here. I don't wanna be TAP=
S, or any other thing. I don't care who accepts my results, I do this for m=
yself, for my own curiosity. I'm not going to accept someone else's version=
 of reality, and I trust my own intuition.
 
 I'm sorry if someone thought =
I implied this shit came from  Edison, or anyone else. I don't recall that.=
 It's more likely that someone suggested it was Edison's concept, or whatev=
er, and I kinda agreed it was like that for discussion--I don't know.  I kn=
ow how it came about in my own mind, as problems are often solved, your own=
 subconcius mind will assemble an answer based on previous experience, and =
I had worked with voltage tunable radios in the mid 90's, then I got intere=
sted in EVP, then I used EVPmaker, then my own mind connected all the dots,=
 nothing mysterious, or other worldly about it. It's that same process that=
