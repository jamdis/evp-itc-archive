<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi LC,

Thanks!  I sent one Gabs way, but I still have the one with the 
wires.  I&#x27;m still testing it every once in awhile too.
I need more time on it though to see if it&#x27;s worth the build.

-Mike

&gt; brilliant!

&gt; How&#x27;s that little chamber do-hicky working for you, btw? ;)

&gt; &gt; Hi Ron,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hopefully your sister has received the radio already.  It got 
&gt; shipped 
&gt; &gt; priority mail.  Have fun with it.  I really like the way the FM 
&gt; scan 
&gt; &gt; rate is....
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; I will be traveling to San Diego from Mexico to visit my sister 
&gt; and 
&gt; &gt; pick up the RS 125 Mike is sending me.  I will be in the San 
Diego 
&gt; &gt; and El Centro area from Feb 15 to 19 and I would love to be able 
to 
&gt; &gt; meet-up with someone from the area who has experience with EVP 
&gt; &gt; technology.  Mike is sending a box already hacked so we can work 
&gt; with 
&gt; &gt; the box and hopefully get something recorded.  Since I have 
little 
&gt; &gt; experience as a newbie to this, I would love to see how someone 
&gt; puts 
&gt; &gt; all of it together...recording, analyzing, etc.  
&gt; &gt; &gt;    
&gt; &gt; &gt;   If you have the time and are willing to give a little on-the-
&gt; job 
&gt; &gt; training, please let me know by email.  By the way, in mid June I 
&gt; &gt; will be traveling from Penn. to NC for two weeks and would love 
to 
&gt; &gt; get together with folks over in that area.  I will probably be 
&gt; &gt; ordering a mini-box to be sent to my folks house in Allentown, so 
I 
&gt; &gt; will have that to play with.  Let me know.  Ron Lederer
