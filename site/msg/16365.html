<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

Awhile back I stopped recording evps because I got unnerved when I began hearing the voices without a radio or recorder. After learning more, I decided to pursue my interest with the help of EVP Maker software rather than a hacked radio. Today I picked up an EVP on my first attempt. I&#x27;ve uploaded it to the new &quot;Al&#x27;s Files&quot; folder. 

The significance: My full first name is Alger, but I go by &quot;Al&quot; because most people mispronounce Alger. It appears that the spirit entity knows my full first name. Do you guys understand the sentence the way that I am hearing it: &quot;Alger help me&quot;  ? Most people incorrectly pronounce Alger with a &quot;grrr&quot; growling sound rather than the softer &quot;jer.&quot; The evp seems to have gotten the pronunciation right, though it is difficult to make out distinctly in the robotic voice.

Another question: I get a lot of &quot;Help me&quot; statements. What is that all about? Any theories? From what do they need help? Anyone else get a lot of calls for  &quot;help&quot; ?

Thanks,
Al</pre>
