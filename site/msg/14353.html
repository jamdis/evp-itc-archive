Thanks Jim, I will give audacity a try too, I have a few of these type  
programs on my pc, but never knew how to use them nor for what, maybe each one  
has a special area, I can always wait til my daughter comes back to MI she  
graduated college, and is looking for work as US Marshal, or Boarder 
Patrol,  FBI, something at state level I guess, MI is limited but, I need her back 
 here,   She went to a Radio/TV broadcast school after getting out of  high 
school, I would bet she would know all about how to work those  programs.  
This lastest recording, the minute one, I could heard them  conversing away, 
sounded like a regular lecture, wish I could understand them  better. sf

Hi, give the AUDACITY software another try. Has option to slow the  
recording down. Another nice feature is that you can use either a highpass or  
lowpass filter (sometimes that is all that is needed) and changing the PITCH  is 
a very handy tool. Always KEEP an original copy of your recordings. I just  
save a copy from inside audacity (to desktop or somewhere) then I will star
t  my work on trying to clear it up. Save the original (and proceeding 
enhanced  version(s) by using the "file" button at to left corner oif program. 
There you  would SAVE "selection" as MP3.(To upload to here) or save to WAV 
(is bigger)  but higher qulity. Can always convert the wav to mp3 from withing 
audacity  also. *you will need to get the mps "pluging" from the website, 
and follow the  information to install it "manually" (once is only needed) 
that way you get  the mp3 converter program free. But really...Audacity is a 
pretty good program  to have round. Has a nice "undo" fesature too, if you 
make a mistake. Happy  Hunting ;) Jim H --- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_
