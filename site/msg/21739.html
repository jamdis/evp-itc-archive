More information about the NJ Devil:


The Jersey Dev=
il is a legendary creature or cryptid said to inhabit the Pine Barrens of S=
outhern New Jersey. The creature is often described as a flying biped with =
hooves, but there are many variations. The Jersey Devil has worked its way =
into the pop culture of the area, even lending its name to New Jersey's tea=
m in the National Hockey League.


Legends and reported encounters:


Most =
accounts of the Jersey Devil legend attribute the creature to a "Mother Lee=
ds", a supposed whore although the tale has many variations. According to o=
ne version, she invoked the devil by saying "let it be the devil" while giv=
ing birth to her 13th child, and when the baby was born, it either immediat=
ely or soon afterward transformed into a devil like creature and flew off i=
nto the surrounding pines. The child was born with horns, a tail, wings, an=
d a horse-like head. The creature revisited Mrs. Leeds every day. She stood=
 at her door and told it to leave. After awhile, the creature got the hint =
and never returned. 
According to legend, while visiting the Hanover Mill W=
orks to inspect his cannonballs being forged, Commodore Stephen Decatur sig=
hted a flying creature flapping its wings and fired a cannonball directly u=
pon it to no effect. Joseph Bonaparte, eldest brother of Emperor Napoleon, =
is also said to have witnessed the Jersey Devil while hunting on his Borden=
town, New Jersey estate around 1820. Throughout the 19th century, the Jerse=
y Devil was blamed for livestock killings, strange tracks, and reported sou=
nds. In the early 20th century, a number of people in New Jersey and neighb=
oring states claimed to witness the Jersey Devil or see its tracks. Claims =
of a corpse matching the Jersey Devil's description arose in 1957. In 1960,=
 the merchants around Camden offered a $10,000 reward for the capture of th=
e Jersey Devil, even offering to build a private zoo to house the creature =
if captured.
There are many other versions of the legend. The legends say i=
t was the 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, or 13th child, It was born normal or deform=
ed, and the mother confined it to the cellar or the attic. Although there a=
re many discrepancies in all of these stories, there are 3 pieces of eviden=
ce that tie all of the legends of the Jersey Devil's origin together. From =
the pre 1909 era, few documented records of sightings still exist. The ones=
 that do, confirm the existence of the devil.
