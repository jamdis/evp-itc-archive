Ellis&#39; book &quot;The Mediumship of \nthe Tape Recorder&quot;.\n\nBoth can be found on the Amazon UK web site and copies are still \navailable even though Ellis&#39; book is long out of print.\n\nRaudive&#39;s book:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Breakthrough-Amazing-Experiment-Electronic-\nCommunication/dp/0900675543/ref=sr_1_1/203-4923892-9954337?\nie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1172891158&sr=1-1\n\nEllis&#39; book: \n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Mediumship-Tape-Recorder-David-\nEllis/dp/095060240X/ref=sr_1_1/203-4923892-9954337?\nie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1172891351&sr=1-1\n\nI bought my copy of Ellis&#39; book there over 6 months ago (I found a \npaperback copy of &quot;Breakthrough&quot; at a local used \nbookstore)...Amazon.co.uk took my credit card easily, made the \nproper currency exchange (I usually check first with an online \ncurrency exchange calculator), and shipped it via e-mail. Got the \nbook within a few days!\n\nYou can also find used and difficult-to-find books at ABE Books \n(these 2 are listed at the moment):\n\nhttp://www.abebooks.com\n\nThe Internet is a godsend for those of us who need items only \navailable elsewhere in the world and so are credit cards as far as \nmaking payments easier.\n\nI would also recommend Alec&#39;s book and CD (I got the electronic \ndownload versions): &quot;EVP And New Dimensions&quot; and &quot;The Sounds of \nEVP&quot;, respectively.\n\nHere&#39;s his ordering web site:\n\nhttp://www.lulu.com/evp\n\nGuy"}
