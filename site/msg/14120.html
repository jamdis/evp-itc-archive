what seems simple to you Frank is not simple for some of us.
Speaking for m=
yself, I don't know anything about radios and speakers
except to turn it on=
 and off using a button. 
I had to watch the video thats out there to hack =
my 469 3 times to make
sure that I was doing it correctly, and I couldn't e=
ven tell you what
the 
hell I did. Now I am trying to figure out how to add=
 all the other stuff
(my term)
to get something similar to what you use, an=
d I just listen to what you
say in
this itc group, and the pictures that yo=
u put out here.
I even bought a book to try to help me. LOL
Hell, I don't e=
ven remember from school what they taught us about how
radios or tvs work f=
or that matter.
If I am the only one then I am just a bigger idiot than I t=
hought.
 
So, some of us need help Frank. That's why I am here.....
It's im=
portant to some people that you go to some events so that you can
teach...
=
Don't be selfish with your mind Frank.... SHARE IT ...... LOL
