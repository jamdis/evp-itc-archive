<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Rosemary,

Where do you live?  I am in Champaign-Urbana, which is only an hour from 
Decatur.  One paranormal group I&#x27;m in is trying to get permission to 
invetigate the Lincoln Theater. I have never been in it but quite a few 
people in this area have and there are lots of stories, pictures etc. of 
it around.

Another haunted place in Decatur is the Greenwood Cemetery.  Now, that one 
I HAVE been in. During our recent flooding, about 40% of that cemetery was 
under water. Very sad. Since it&#x27;s dried out a bit, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s 
receded by now.

&gt; I was at the Lincoln Theater in October, and one of the Chicago
&gt; researchers got an amazing photograph of a Shadow Person in the main
&gt; seating area.  I took the Mini to the Mezzanine because I had seen an
&gt; apparition of a man in a dark suit there -- he kept walking up to me
&gt; and standing next to me, then vanishing.  But I did not hear anything
&gt; obvious via the box there.  The basement was the best.  There is a lot
&gt; going on in that theater.

&gt;&gt; I know some people who got a VIDEO of One-Armed Red a few years ago
&gt; in the
&gt;&gt; basement. He walked across the room, plainly in view (well, you
&gt; could see
&gt;&gt; the shape but no features).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Recently I did an investigation at the Lincoln Theater in Decatur, IL
&gt;&gt;&gt; with my Mini-Box, and got some interesting clips from the basement
&gt;&gt;&gt; area.  The files are too large to be uploaded to the forum here, but a
&gt;&gt;&gt; short video with the audio clips has been posted on You Tube by Joey
&gt;&gt;&gt; Tito, a Chicago researcher who filmed the investigation.  The audio
&gt;&gt;&gt; clips are at the end, and Joey matched them to a transcript of what I
&gt;&gt;&gt; picked up.  I sent the clips to Frank, and he picked up even more.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; The You Tube link is www.youtube.com/xflexx1  Joey has a short version
&gt;&gt;&gt; and a long version; pick the short one.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have a report on the investigation posted on my blog on MySpace at
&gt;&gt;&gt; www.myspace.com/rosemaryellenguiley  and Joey&#x27;s video is on my home
&gt;&gt;&gt; page there as well.  The blog also has my report on a similar
&gt;&gt;&gt; investigation at Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield; the clips from
&gt;&gt;&gt; that are posted on this forum in my folder.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Regards,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rosemary
