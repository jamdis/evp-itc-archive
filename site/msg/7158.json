I got them from \nboth sides of the veil. I wish I had time to do more sessions with \nthe boxes. I don&#39;t know why people can&#39;t hear my voices I get with \nthe boxes. I guess maybe I&#39;m the they only are meant for me to hear I \ndon&#39;t know. They are clear to me. It&#39;s a mystery to me. Maybe I&#39;ll \nget some that you all can hear one of these days. I clean them up \nlike I do with tradional EVPs maybe I should do them differently. I \nseem to get alot of voices talking to each other and hearing many \nnames being said do you people hear that also ?  I get a ton of \nTradional EVPs it seems everywhere I go. My group S.P.I.R.I.T. \nParanormal Investigation Team of central PA will be doing an \ninvestigation at the Jenny Wade House in Gettysburg,PA. March 7th I \ncan&#39;t wait for that one. I hope to take some boxes there and see what \nI get. Oh well you all take care for now and be good. Frank Sumption \nis the man if he didn&#39;t invent his box where would we be now ? I \ndon&#39;t think we would be doing this do you? Keep up the fine job your \ndoing Frank S. and don&#39;t worry what others may think or say negative \nwise it&#39;s the positive things your accomplishing that matters. All of \nyou people are doing a fine job in here as a matter of fact. When we \nall get along it&#39;s magic. So keep the magic flowing and keep on \nsweeping on (lol) just a pun. \n\nRegards,\n\nRalph the Ghost Hunter\n(There&#39;s always a nut in the group LOL)"}
