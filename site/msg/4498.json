The 470 is Joel&#39;s box, and when I first turned it on, it kept asking for Joel and Jeff (Jeff picked it up for us).  It seemed that the first 3 minutes was nothing but questions from the otherside as to why I had Joel & Jeff&#39;s box.  It was almost that I needed to get permission to use it, LOL.  I think they were giving Joel attitude for not doing his sessions everyday like I was and the fact that maybe if he conducted more sessions that he would know if his tec was assigned.  \n   \n  I love their sense of humor!!!\n   \n  Juli\n\nbruce halliday &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n          Joel,\n \nI hear the &quot;how would you know&quot; after you ask about the tech.
