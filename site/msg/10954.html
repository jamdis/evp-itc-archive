<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello!  My name is Sandie.  I live in Renton, WA.

I&#x27;ve been fascinated with the paranormal since I was young.  My
mother&#x27;s side of the family is sensitive to the paranormal and I have
one aunt that is a medium, albeit a very reluctant one.  I should also
mention that my mother&#x27;s side of the family is from Taiwan and it the
culture can be very superstitious, hence my aunt&#x27;s reluctance.

I think I&#x27;ve always had some experience with the paranormal, from
places I lived to places I&#x27;ve visited, but it&#x27;s very rare that I see
them.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t inherit that ability.  I&#x27;ve only had
one experience with seeing a spirit/ghost when I was awake.

I&#x27;ve recently started to record EVPs, and it&#x27;s been trying to say the
least.  If I&#x27;m getting anything, I don&#x27;t hear it on playback. 
HOWEVER, recently I visited a cemetery to show my daughter our
relatives&#x27; headstones and we wandered the place with a recorder, as
well as took pictures.

Upon playback, I notated 23 instances of possible EVPs, 5 or 6 were
clear enough to actually hear specific words.  Whether or not they&#x27;re
what I think they are is another question.  The others I pulled from
the master are unknowns and questionables, but suspected EVPs.  I just
can&#x27;t make it out.

I use Audacity, which I really do not like.  I had Audition, a full
version, but lost it when my computer crashed, and I loved that one.  

Anyway, I&#x27;ll upload the EVPs.  If anyone can help in verifying what I
think is being said, I&#x27;d appreciate it.

I will note that these are direct copies from the master, so there&#x27;s
been no cleanup done to them.  Mostly because I need to learn to use
Audacity&#x27;s filtering and noise reduction without removing the voices.

I have them in .wav files, so I&#x27;ll convert them to .mp3 and upload
them, to save on space.

=)
