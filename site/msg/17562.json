I am not sure what your\n&gt; hearing. Which file do you hear it in?\n&gt;\n&gt; It is an auto sweep, so you hear the regular switching of the channels.\n&gt; This particular device adds more white noise in the background, so maybe\n&gt; that is what you are hearing as well. It has more of shhhh sound per switch\n&gt; than a Frank&#39;s box or shack hack.\n&gt;\n&gt;  On Sun, Jun 6, 2010 at 6:43 PM, &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   sounds like chains rattling, what&#39;s making the heavy noise? sounds like\n&gt;&gt; banging something together, like metal objects\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  In a message dated 6/6/2010 6:40:12 P.M.
