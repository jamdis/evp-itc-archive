I got a similar answer, but in a deep voice, when I asked for a cure for a specific type of cancer - lol!  I have a bunch of comedians around here. \n\n--- In EVP-ITC@...m, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  I mean--get a voice that seems to be really cool, and not one frikin&#39;\n&gt; person to share to with. I am not about to spend every waking moment after I\n&gt; retire building boxes for bozos that seek only fame and fortune, and only\n&gt; want a box to show off on all kinds of duffus shows, and never use the damn\n&gt; thing for anykind of intelligent communcation from the other side.\n&gt; \n&gt;  What torques my jaws is I get stuff that shows they manipulate the\n&gt; broadcast fragments to form messages and phrases, and I might well\n&gt; demonstrate it to my dogs, as it is always ignored on all groups.  Everyone\n&gt; is too damn busy doing shows and bogus investigations to actually figure out\n&gt; how this stuff works. How to turn it to profit is the only question on most\n&gt; minds here.\n&gt; \n&gt;  For the one in 12 million that might be curious, they took athe ad fore\n&gt; Rosetta Stone software &quot;the natural way to learn a foreign language&quot; and\n&gt; changed it to &quot;the natural way to learn---sex!&quot;. Not demon enough, or ghost\n&gt; hunters enough for most I guess.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
