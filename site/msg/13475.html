<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Please let us know when the youtube video is up.  I would love to see your results.  I&#x27;m just 
weighing the idea of getting one.  My concern is that there is only an antenna.  There is no 
emf sensor or thermometer set up with it (like the ovilus) so my guess is it&#x27;s just turning 
stray signals (whatever that might be) into words.  Not sure that&#x27;s the greatest method of 
communication.  Just my random thoughts.

&gt; &gt; Has anyone seen this talker box, which was developed as an inexpensive
&gt; &gt; way of creating your own ovilus?  I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has seen it
&gt; &gt; or has one and used it.  Is it decent?
