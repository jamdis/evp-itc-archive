I don't know about being a wealth of information.
Just be careful using it =
Chad, and don't get obsessed with it.
Especially after what you said about =
your experiences.
You don't need to make your sessions any longer than
10 o=
r 15 minutes at a time.....

Deb,

You were right. The 469 validated EVPs that I=
 have captured in my
apartment. the name given was the same as on the EVP w=
hen I asked who
was here.

You are a wealth of information. Thank you.
