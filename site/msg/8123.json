I was there last May, in the morning just \nwhen it opened; there was no one else around and I heard \nunexplainable footsteps walking above me in Cell Block 4 and, upon \ninvestigation, discovered there was no one up there.  I also picked \nup what may be an EVP - &quot;Hi&quot; - at Al Capone&#39;s cell and definitely \nfeel that the soft music that was playing in his cell may have \ncontributed the necessary bits of raw audio for that to come through.\n\nPlease keep us posted on your upcoming shows; I saw the first one, \ntoo, and enjoyed it very much, despite Maury&#39;s exaggerated \npersonality.\n\nSharon\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;misujoey&quot; &lt;Debbie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s the link to one segment ...\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.thehauntingevidence.com/easternstatepennitentiary.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Debbie\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;misujoey&quot; &lt;Debbie@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jeffrey Wands, my Paranormal Team T.H.E.M. and I investigated \nEastern \n&gt; &gt; State Penitentiary with the Maury Show Producers.
