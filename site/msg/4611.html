<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Robin,

Radio Shack now carries the Olympus VN-4100PC at about the same price I 
paid for my VN-960PC a couple years ago.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with the 
960. The 4100 has about 4 times the recording time, I think. That would 
make it about 24 hours.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m new to the group but probably know some of you from another
&gt; list.  I haven&#x27;t been too active in the realm of EVP recording
&gt; recently, but have had what I consider excellent results in the past
&gt; using my little refurbished Ebay-bargain Olympus VN-120 PC.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m anxious to start recording again and am feeling pretty
&gt; overwhelmed by the technology you all seem to be using.  I know a
&gt; little about using good headphones and denoiser programs, but beyond
&gt; that I&#x27;m electronically challenged.  Still, I wonder if there are
&gt; simple techniques I can experiment with to increase my success.  I
&gt; think I&#x27;m a little bored.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ve felt pretty strongly that I&#x27;ve been communicating with a very
&gt; small number of entities, and I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s due to the
&gt; limitations of my equipment. My most impressive EVPs have always been
&gt; captured around my own home, particularly outside on the hill and
&gt; near the barn.  I&#x27;ve gotten two inside my house (after inviting
&gt; spirits in), and probably 75% in total have been negative messages.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I&#x27;m thinking about getting another DVR and would love to hear
&gt; your thoughts and recommendations about which ones are best.  I would
&gt; like to communicate with more advanced entities eventually, but
&gt; unfortunately don&#x27;t have the brain for building anything myself.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
&gt; Robin
