I received no prediction on the object from you Frank, or from your methods=

Th=
anks again for everyone who participated! I admire your courage and motivat=
ion to try different methods, see what works, and try to improve everyone's=
 understanding of EVP-ITC.

If you recall, on 7/10/2010 I placed an object =
on top of my computer monitor, right in front of me, and left it there unti=
l today, 7/14/2010, noon Denver time. The experiment was for participants t=
o determine what it was. Vague or partial answers wouldn't be counted (for =
example, just colors, shapes, sizes, what it's made of, etc): we're looking=
 for what it is. Participants could use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, o=
r I suppose any other means they chose.


In order to keep me honest, I too=
k a picture of the object at the start of the experiment and loaded it to t=
he Files section (RJ folder) of this group. If you can follow the link, it =
is here:

http://tech. groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.201007=
10. 1.zip


The idea was that you could download the file at the beginning =
of the test, and 'keep it safe' on your computer. Then at the end of the te=
st, I would release the password so you could reveal the contents of the fi=
le. That way, you were in control of the original image during the entire t=
est, not me. 


The password for that file is: 123BlastOff
Instructions, if=
 you need them, are also in that RJ folder.

And if you did not care to dow=
nload the zip file before the test, I will post the final image there too.
=


So to the results:

Number of participants: 5
Total tries: 8
Ambiguous an=
swers: 0
Correct answers: 0

Object: A radio
Uzipped picture:
http://tech. =
groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710. 1.JPG


So what do =
the results mean? All that we can really agree on from this experiment is t=
hat no participant, with whatever theories or methods or technology they us=
ed, was able to correctly determine the object. We can't say those theories=
 or methods or technologies never work. Just as we can't say they do. Just =
that, for whatever reason, they did not work this time. Readers can take th=
e results, use them to improve or change their methods, or keep doing what =
they're doing.


If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for imp=
rovement, let me know. I hope to get a new experiment up and running soon. =
Since there wasn't much participation Mon-Wed, I think the next experiment =
will be arranged to mostly span the weekends.


Again, thanks to everyone w=
ho participated in this first experiment.
