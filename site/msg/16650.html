<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>So it&#x27;s like using a muscle, do you think?  We&#x27;re honing our abilities by using them?

&gt; Try this option out for size.

&gt; The Box clearly is a translator/tuner for the entities, to speak to you.
&gt; Obviously you are able to &#x27;understand&#x27; or &#x27;translate&#x27; what the box says. 
&gt; When you hear the entities speak to you.
&gt;   It would follow, that there is some kind of tuning in going on, after 
&gt; all.
&gt; And it also seems to me that maybe you are also &#x27;tuning&#x27; in psychically 
&gt; while using the box, just its subtle.
&gt; 
&gt; I gather that unless prompted people may occasionally hear/perceive 
&gt; different things, there was a thread to that effect not too long ago.
&gt; 
&gt; Well thats my two cents worth, but Franks congrats, its an exciting 
&gt; time.  Enjoy! and keep us in the loop.

&gt; &gt; I think you have a reasonable theory, and I like it. Except what I was 
&gt; &gt; referring to was the way using the box makes you suddenly more able to 
&gt; &gt; have psychic abilities, e.g. having more dreams that are &quot;visitations&quot; 
&gt; &gt; from the dead, or being more able to know right before your best 
&gt; &gt; friend is going to phone you, stuff like that. Psychic abilities. Why 
&gt; &gt; should using the box make stuff like that happen more easily? Because 
&gt; &gt; it does, and it&#x27;s weird!
