Th=\r\ne spirit&#39;s  with the most credibility are \n\n&gt; going to be harder  to hear, =\r\nsince they are well beyond the white light, and are \n\n&gt;  in much higher pla=\r\nins.

Because \n\n&gt; of th=\r\nis it&#39;s going to be tough, if I gave everyone&#39;s  opinion out of the 4 \n\n&gt; m=\r\ninutes, you could write a book, then  when I found Dave&#39;s voice, he was not=\r\n \n\n&gt; so easy to hear, I had  to make it louder, when I tried to reach Him o=\r\nn \n\n&gt; Skype, I  couldn&#39;t get what He said correctly, so it was my own fault=\r\n,  and not \n\n&gt; His. sf\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; In a message  dated 7/14/2010 6:27:09 P=\r\n.M.

I think we have all  experienced \n\n&gt; the difficulty in hearing wh=\r\nat is on  some of these recordings: sometimes \n\n&gt; we&#39;re not sure  at first =\r\nwhat it says. Sometimes we ask others for  their \n\n&gt; input.  Sometimes we o=\r\nnly hear it once  someone else tells us it first.  \n\n&gt; Sometimes we  hear i=\r\nt wrong.  Sometimes we hear it right. And  so on.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; It would be useful=\r\n to know, as an  individual, how good we are at hearing \n\n&gt; it right, so  w=\r\ne have some idea how trustworthy our skill, or  methods, or \n\n&gt; technology,=\r\n is.  If we can measure  that, or even get a feel for it, we can \n\n&gt; look f=\r\nor  ways to improve it.  If we can&#39;t measure it,  then we could be \n\n&gt; stuc=\r\nk.  \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; So, by  restricting the answers only to the timeframe of the  e=\r\nxperiment, \n\n&gt; we can help filter out some of the  problems of subjectivity=\r\n: for example, \n\n&gt; one theory is  that people can hear what they want to he=\r\nar, or can  these \n\n&gt; sounds in a certain way, once you already know  the a=\r\nnswer.  Or, given 2 ways to \n\n&gt; hear a sound,  being influenced, even subco=\r\nnsciously, to hear it  one way \n\n&gt; over the other.  We want to rule that  o=\r\nut.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; This is one reason we can only count on  answers given during th=\r\ne \n\n&gt; timeframe.  That is  when the answer is most objective.  Once the  ob=\r\nject has been \n\n&gt; announced, we move into a   period where we can&#39;t discoun=\r\nt possible influence  \n\n&gt; from already knowing the answer.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; But, I am=\r\n  confident that if a person&#39;s method or technology  really can \n\n&gt; reveal =\r\nthe correct answer outside the  timeframe, then doing it within the \n\n&gt; tim=\r\neframe should  be just as easy, and would then be a valid objective  result=\r\n \n\n&gt; for all to see.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; --- On Wed,  7/14/10, SnowfireL@aol. com &lt;Snowf=\r\nireL@aol.  com&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; From:  SnowfireL@aol. com &lt;SnowfireL@aol.=\r\n  com&gt;\n\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Experiment  20100710 - RESULTS!\n\n&gt; To: EVP=\r\n-ITC@yahoogroups  .com\n\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, July 14, 2010, 2:50  PM\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n=\r\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; it  doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s in the whole file, I didn&#39;t  think it was =\r\npossible \n\n&gt; to have a radio sit on top  of a pc screen i guess.

The experiment was for p=\r\narticipants to  determine what it was. \n\n&gt; Vague or partial answers  wouldn=\r\n&#39;t be counted (for example, just colors,  \n\n&gt; shapes, sizes, what it&#39;s made=\r\n of, etc): we&#39;re  looking for what it is. \n\n&gt; Participants could use  their=\r\n ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or I suppose  any other \n\n&gt; means they chose.\n=\r\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; In order to  keep me honest, I took a picture of the object  at the =\r\nstart \n\n&gt; of the experiment and loaded it to  the Files section (RJ folder)=\r\n of this \n\n&gt; group. If  you can follow the link, it is here:\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; _http:/=\r\n/tech.  groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/  RJ/RJ.20100710. \n\n&gt; 1.zip_=\r\n (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip) \n\n=\r\n&gt; \n\n&gt; The idea was  that you could download the file at the  beginning of t=\r\nhe \n\n&gt; test, and &#39;keep it safe&#39; on  your computer. Then at the end of the t=\r\nest, I  \n\n&gt; would release the password so you could reveal  the contents of=\r\n the file. That \n\n&gt; way, you were in  control of the original image during =\r\nthe entire  test, not \n\n&gt; me. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; The password for that file  is: 123Bl=\r\nastOff\n\n&gt; Instructions, if you need  them, are also in that RJ folder.\n\n&gt; \n=\r\n\n&gt; And if  you did not care to download the zip file before  the test, I wi=\r\nll \n\n&gt; post the final image there  too.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; So to the results:\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Nu=\r\nmber of  participants: 5\n\n&gt; Total tries: 8\n\n&gt; Ambiguous  answers: 0\n\n&gt; Corr=\r\nect answers: 0\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Object:  A radio\n\n&gt; Uzipped picture:\n\n&gt; _http://tech.=\r\n  groups.yahoo. com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/  RJ/RJ.20100710. \n\n&gt; 1.JPG_ (http=\r\n://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG) \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; =\r\nSo what do the  results mean? All that we can really agree on  from this \n\n=\r\n&gt; experiment is that no participant,  with whatever theories or methods or =\r\n\n\n&gt; technology  they used, was able to correctly determine the  object. We =\r\ncan&#39;t say \n\n&gt; those theories or methods  or technologies never work. Just a=\r\ns we can&#39;t say  \n\n&gt; they do. Just that, for whatever reason, they  did not =\r\nwork this time. \n\n&gt; Readers can take the  results, use them to improve or c=\r\nhange their  methods, or \n\n&gt; keep doing what they&#39;re  doing.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; If anyo=\r\nne has any observations,  comments, or ideas for improvement, let me \n\n&gt; kn=\r\now.

I think we have all  experienced &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; the difficulty in hearing what is on  some of these recordings: sometime=\r\ns &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; we&#39;re not sure  at first what it says. Sometimes we ask others =\r\nfor  their &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; input.  Sometimes we only hear it once  someone else t=\r\nells us it first.  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sometimes we  hear it wrong.  Sometimes we hea=\r\nr it right. And  so on.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It would be useful to know, as a=\r\nn  individual, how good we are at hearing &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; it right, so  we have s=\r\nome idea how trustworthy our skill, or  methods, or &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; technology, i=\r\ns.  If we can measure  that, or even get a feel for it, we can &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; lo=\r\nok for  ways to improve it.  If we can&#39;t measure it,  then we could be &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; stuck.  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So, by  restricting the answers only to t=\r\nhe timeframe of the  experiment, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; we can help filter out some of t=\r\nhe  problems of subjectivity: for example, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; one theory is  that pe=\r\nople can hear what they want to hear, or can  these &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sounds in a c=\r\nertain way, once you already know  the answer.  Or, given 2 ways to &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; hear a sound,  being influenced, even subconsciously, to hear it  one wa=\r\ny &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; over the other.  We want to rule that  out.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nThis is one reason we can only count on  answers given during the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n timeframe.  That is  when the answer is most objective.  Once the  object =\r\nhas been &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; announced, we move into a   period where we can&#39;t discou=\r\nnt possible influence  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; from already knowing the answer.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; But, I am  confident that if a person&#39;s method or technology  rea=\r\nlly can &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; reveal the correct answer outside the  timeframe, then do=\r\ning it within the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; timeframe should  be just as easy, and would th=\r\nen be a valid objective  result &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; for all to see.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; --- On Wed,  7/14/10, SnowfireL@aol. com &lt;SnowfireL@aol.  com&gt; wrot=\r\ne:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; From:  SnowfireL@aol. com &lt;SnowfireL@aol=\r\n.  com&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Experiment  20100710 - RESULTS!&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups  .com&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, July 14, 2=\r\n010, 2:50  PM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; it  doesn&#39;t matter, i=\r\nt&#39;s in the whole file, I didn&#39;t  think it was possible &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to have a =\r\nradio sit on top  of a pc screen i guess.
