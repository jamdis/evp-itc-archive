<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Zack, I have a new radionics kit based on the original Hieronymus
machine. It made from Bakelite, even the stick plate is. I still need
to wire it up so I just placed the components on the still unassembled
board and uploaded a pic in my photo album on this forum. The stick
plate is also made of Bakelite but I placed a small plastic square
where the stick pad goes. My crazy plane was to adapt it to the tuning
mechanism of Frank&#x27;s Box to allow an intuitive tactile feedback
interface so I could try to find the frequencies where spirits contact
us. 

Sort of like the manual linear sweep but with a stick pad added. These
3 dial machines are still available from Bill Jensen out of Knoxville
TN who makes them to original spec except with modern internal
circuitry. -Bill Murphy

&gt; &gt; This time I made a small plastic echo box. I tried plastic years
ago, and it
&gt; &gt; didn&#x27;t work, this time it seems to. The injection speaker accounts
for the
&gt; &gt; weaker voices I think, since it&#x27;s an ear bud, and is 32 ohm,
normal speakers
&gt; &gt; are 8 ohms. More voices are in my folder.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; There are so many different types of plastics with so many different 
&gt; characteristics ... ABS plastic, PVC, Delrin, acrylic, PTFE (teflon), 
&gt; Cyrolon ZX ...
&gt; 
&gt; It might be interesting to experiment with different types and see what 
&gt; works the best.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone here ever build a Hieronymus machine?  I understand teflon (or 
&gt; fiberglass-teflon PC board material) works incredibly well for the
&gt; &quot;stick&quot; sensor plate.
