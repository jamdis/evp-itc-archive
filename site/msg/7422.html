Hi all; There are alternatives;  1-EVPmaker, a free program that runs on a=
 PC and performs the same function as the box, that is it provides the raw =
audio spirits/entities use to form voices. It is in fact the inspiration fo=
r my boxes.  2-The Mini box by paranormalsystems.com. It's a direct output,=
 linear sweep system based on my boxes, and it does work.  3-Use the manual=
 sweep mathod, take a radio that can be tuned easily by hand, tune the dial=
 up and down slowly while recording directly from the speaker. Always annou=
nce you are doing an EVP session before you start recording. Manual sweep w=
as the basis for linear sweep that the Mini box uses, and that I have adopt=
ed for my boxes, and was first developed here on this group.  3- Foreign la=
nguage-Tune in a short wave broadcast in a language you don't understand, a=
nd record directly from the speaker of the radio. You can also use an inter=
net foreign language boroadcast for the same purpose. See coffeepotghost.co=
m for more information.  4-Radio between stations as a source of white nois=
e. I like to pick a night when there lots of skip, stations fadding in and =
oput randomly, this is a great source of raw audio. You'll have ignore the =
critics that cliam you're only hearing broadcast fragments, you hav eto jud=
ge the result by meaning, that is, does the message mean anything personall=
y?   I'm sure there's other methods out on the web. I suggest peole start w=
iht white noise, and work your way up. 
 
 There is nothing magical about t=
he boxes, it's a swept radio, nothing more. It provides a higher level--lou=
der--audio that spirits use to make voices, that is all it does!   I usuall=
y do not ask questions when I do sessions, I think that biases the mind int=
o expecting, and maybe even creating the answers one wants the hear. I rely=
 on the guides to give me what I need. I also don't do "investigations", ag=
ain I think it biases your mind into creating what you want. I really doubt=
 there is any haunting if no one is there to experience it.   I know---what=
 I say is to be dismissed as it doesn't jive with the Hollywood version of =
the paranormal.      Frank-S
