<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, everytime i ask which box i should be using they always say 
Joe&#x27;s Box.  I believe that box become the portal to hell for me so i 
stay away or at least for now anyway.  Reception is never a problem 
for me, but not all devices work well everyday.  Frank&#x27;s box #27 is 
very noisy but always gives me very direct answers to my questions 
everytime.  All of them have given me great results at some point and 
when newer stuff comes out i will try them too.  Never get stuck on 
one particular method or box, you have to mix it up all the time to 
get different responses.  Some days i just feel like doing a manual 
sweep, it&#x27;s always different.  If i can get the Minibox to give me 
real time answers than that would be the best because of the clarity 
of the radio.  The minibox is so clear to listen to, but you have to 
go over it with headphones and patience to find out the answers.  The 
answers are there though, so maybe i just have to get used to the way 
it works a little better.

&gt; It funny just how they know what box&#x27;s your using.  I started with 
the 469 first, they told me to switch to the 470 and the reception 
stunk, so we switch back.  I alway ask them, which reception is 
better on the otherside.

&gt; Had a pretty good session today, i&#x27;ve been pretty blocked with 
other 
&gt; boxes yet i seem to always get great results with the RS 12-470. 
Some 
&gt; really good responses to my questions. Hey babs, i think you should 
&gt; give the RS box a little time and maybe you will start to get 
stuff. 
&gt; Although i have a 12-469 also and it really sux compared to the 12-
&gt; 470. The constant pulsing noise in the 469 model just drives me 
crazy 
&gt; enough to not concentrate. Try looking for an older style model of 
the 
&gt; 12-470, that&#x27;s probably the best radio i own hands down. Instant 
&gt; results always and consistently. All my boxes work, but they are 
&gt; finicky sometimes. No need to comment to my posted files guys, just 
&gt; listen and see if i&#x27;m on some sort of a right track with the 
&gt; communication.
