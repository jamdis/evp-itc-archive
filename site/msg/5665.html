<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Use a few minute of regular speech audio as the raw, store as a wave 
file. It helps to use as clear as possible speech, even so, the output 
can be kinda distorted, as the raw audio is chopped up, and played back 
randomly. I save the session and export the aduio to the same folder as 
the session. I use an audio program to copy, and past out the phrases 
and messages. I don&#x27;t use any filtering, but sometime will slow down 
the playback to make it easier. Sometimes the voices can be 
mulitlayered, which is confusing to listen to. Mostly, just follow the 
instructions! There is a manual that has to be downloaded seperately.

&gt; I am getting nowhere with my RS hack here in Mexico. I still need to 
send a recorded session to Bruce to double check because I may not be 
hearing certain things and I would like a verification of the signal 
quality I am receiving.  HST I do have EVP maker and I am now 
encouraged by what Frank S is saying.  Any tips on how to do a session 
with this program?  Ron L
