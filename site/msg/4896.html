<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;m still relatively new to building boxes and would like to know if 
it&#x27;s possible to speed up the scanning a bit on a hacked RS 12-469.  

Thanks,
Sharon

&gt;  Thanks for listening. Yeah, that&#x27;s the problem with noise 
reduction methods, they tend to take out voices. I think if I used 
the muffled sound consistently they would talk through it though, the 
goal being to get higher level voices, and audio.  The clarifier is 
just a low pass filter that can be adjusted--just an idea.
&gt;  I have some female guides that speak sometimes, and there&#x27;s the 
seven sisters that come though sometimes, but I don&#x27;t know much about 
that.

&gt; Frank, Thanks for the extra instructions, it doesn&#x27;t sound too 
difficult for me so I&#x27;ll give it a shot. 
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, I did listen to your tone control clip. Since I&#x27;m new 
to this my comments are probably not &quot;worth&quot; much at this point. I 
thought the entire clip itself was a lot smoother and clearer than 
most I&#x27;ve heard so far from various sources (the mixed station sounds 
are in smaller pieces so for someone like me it would be easier to 
pick out the EVPs as opposed to entire words from radio announcers). 
The short piece about 2/3 of the way through, where I&#x27;m guessing you 
used a clarifier, sounded muffled to me, which makes me think it 
would also muffle the EVPs. Definitely easier on the ears but for 
someone inexperienced (and I seem to be the only one here!) it seems 
it would be harder to pick out the real words too.
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, in listening to the deluge of clips uploaded last 
night, I can&#x27;t help but notice that the voices are all men. Just 
curious -- is that always the case?

&gt;  I have the &#x27;470, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the older one or not. I 
was able to modify it, but it was somewhat different than in the 
video instruction, there was more than one green wire. You have to 
lift the top board so you can see the wire connections on the other 
board, they are labeled, and you can tell what wire to cut/unsolder.  
(mute wire).   Frank-S
