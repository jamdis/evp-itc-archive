Tell me where the seperation on t=
he spectrum takes place between 300Hz and 300KHz. Yes, soundwaves cause pre=
ssure waves that our ears read as vibration and our mind translates as soun=
d. The waves are still on the electromagnetic spectrum. Even subsonic geoma=

=C2=A0
A mistake that a lot of people make is thinking that there are =
two different types of energy at work when it comes to sound waves and elec=
tromagnetic waves. The only thing that seperates them is frequency and powe=
r. Radio waves are radio waves because they occupy a certain block of the e=
lectromagnietic spectrum. Sound waves exist on that same spectrum just fart=
her down with much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic waves can penetrat=
e almost anything because of their wavelengths. The shorter the wavelength =
the more ways we can shield against them.
=C2=A0
Think of microwaves. These=
 are also a type of radio and telemetry transmitting wave but the waves als=
o have a physical effect on our environment by causing molecules to speed u=
p, which creates heat. A little lower than this is IR or infrared it too ca=

Here is some food for th=
ought. I am currently reviewing my audio from our May 30th investigation.
=
=C2=A0
It was me and another girl teammate=C2=A0present in the room. I pick=
ed up a 3rd female voice on my digital voice recorder that I carry with me.=
 We were standing right next to another digital video recorder that I leave=
 beside my night vision camera. That recorder did not pick up this 3rd voic=
e. I have asked the girl that was with me to check her recording to see if =
she picked it up.
=C2=A0
I have long felt the true EVP does not come from s=
ound waves in the environment, or then it wouldn't be EVP, but a disembodie=
d voice. Somehow EVP's are appearing directly on the recordings.
=C2=A0
Thi=
s instance with the recorders may back that theory up. That other recorder =
should have picked that voice up if it were sound waves in the environment.=

=C2=A0
I am attaching the clip of this 3rd voice. The=C2=A0file that is na=
med=C2=A0"01-02-17 Clip" is the full clip.=C2=A0You will hear my voice as I=
 say "Yeah", and then another comes in right after that. I think I know wha=
t it says.
=C2=A0
Again, I was live monitoring my audio, but still did not =
hear this until playback. It isn't clear, so I am not as excited about it a=
s my one's from the last investigation.

I have a runni=

 where they want it to manifest. It works off the heterodyne principle. If =
you mix two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequency then if y=
ou add or subtract them together you get a beat frequency or alternate freq=
uency. For example, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an=
 electric fan in a room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you =
will have a intermediate difference=C2=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within hum=
an hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electro=

is theory I always felt that EVP were generated within a few inches of the =
recorder.

<DIV>Fascinating=
! I've had this idea that the EVP are often not recorded by the microp=
hone but somehow make their way in at the actual point where the stora=

<DIV>I am curious if anyone with a microph=
one wired to a remote site has ever gotten any EVP in real time.</DIV>
<DIV=

<DIV>I took part in an investigation of Ashmore Est=
ates, near Ashmore IL, on Saturday night. We had six video cameras set up i=
n the three halls of the building. The video for all was being monitor=
ed and recorded at a central location. Alas, we did not have microphon=
es at the camera sites conected to the central location. I wonder what we m=
ight have heard if we did?</DIV>
