thats my point on the subject too.... i have comments that make up a full sentances... of 5 words... and you can hear me scanning past 4 to 8 channels ( cant remember exactly how many) but i remember saying- how could i get the same voice across 5 stations or what not? theres just no way....
  i do love manual sweeps but i gotta tell ya i sure lust after some of the fancier ghost-boxes! lol

          Yeah, manually sweeping gives the user the opportunity of being a 
part of the whole EVP experience i feel. Same goes with using sound 
soap for evp's. The GE radio i use for the manual sweeps sounds like 
the old Frank's boxes in random mode, with the treble turned up it 
even sounds like it has an echo box. It has a good sound and given a 
bunch of clear answers to me as well, you can hear how fast i'm 
sweeping the dial yet i get the same voice with a full 
sentence....weird. If you scan up and down the band that fast, how 
do you get the same voice?
