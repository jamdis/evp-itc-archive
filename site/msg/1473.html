<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Misty, thank you for your post. I will upload some files. There 
have been interesting sessions with how the Boxes address people by 
name. And now that it&#x27;s happening to Steve it seems like this is part 
of the phenomena of the Box that is repeatable and observed by 
others. -Bill

&gt; Bill said something that had me thinking. He mentioned that when he 
first got his box it called Franks name repeatedly. That isnt the 
first time I saw someone say that. I know quite a few of you now have 
been given a box or even constructed your own versions like Steve 
based on the work Frank did. 
&gt;    
&gt;   I have heard a couple of peoples results here but I would like to 
hear more so I am going to ask if you have one you comment on your 
use of it and how you think the results went as well as maybe post a 
few sound files that I can hear. I have spent years listening to the 
box voices but its refreshing to hear others results and see the 
variations as with any other evp method, it differs by user/location. 
LOL you know who you are and I wont name you all but I do hope you 
will share with us.
&gt;    
&gt;   Thanks!
&gt;   Misty
