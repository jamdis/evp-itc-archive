I&#39;ve tried most of the shack hacks but not this one so please let us know how you \nlike it if you do try it.  \n\nFor doing manual sweeps, I *really* like the Duracell KP028 handheld emergency flashlight \nradio.  You can pick them up from Amazon in a twin-pack for about $25.  The little knob \nis perfect for sweeping.  I think, compared to everything sweep related that I&#39;ve tried, I get \nthe longest, clearest responses, sometimes in a single tone of voice, with this unit.   :-)\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ourobouros2k2&quot; &lt;ourobouros2k2@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; My wife is starting to look at me funny when I pull up \n&gt; radioshack.com &#39;cause she knows what&#39;s coming.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have seen where Steve reports that this mod is pretty difficult \n&gt; (getting to the mute wire) and, like him, I love a good challenge. I \n&gt; was wondering though, if anyone has used this modded radio regularly \n&gt; and can give opinions on it&#39;s performance stacked up against a 12-469 -\n&gt; 470 or 20-125. Looks like a more robust design, and that tuner knob \n&gt; looks like a great candidate for manual tuning as well. Any thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; Andy\n&gt;"}
