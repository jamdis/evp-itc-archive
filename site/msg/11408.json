Both occurred in\n&gt; &gt; the solitary confinement area: &quot;it&#39;s dark&quot; and &quot;the box is talking.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; The speaker was a different one than I usually use, an iSymphony\n&gt; &gt; T-Speaker from Radio Shack.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; Rosemary Ellen Guiley\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
