Thanks! Would that account for the tapping noise?

        Yes=
.  Also faulty wiring, which is even more dangerous.
        Also with flak=
ey transformers or other power distribution in the area, or power lines.
  =
      Perhaps you can check with some neighbors, and see how their power is=
 doing.

          Hi All,

          Is there someone =
here that can answer and electrical question for me?

          During the =
case that I recorded those possible EVP's-there was a loud tapping noise th=
at seemed to come from the 2nd bedroom. Upon checking my logs, every time o=
ne of  these clicks were heard, there would be an EMF spike in the livingro=
om. The 2nd bedroom is upstairs, the livingroom downstairs. The home owners=
 have also reported that they have a touch lamp that comes on all the time =
by itself and the lights in the Kitchen will dim occasionally.

          N=
ow these taps are not consistent in timing, loudness or rhythm. Could this =
be the work of faulty breakers?

          Thanks!
          April
