<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi LK.  I used to want to educate people like this, but have somewhat reached a point 
where I feel it&#x27;s not worth the time and effort.  Perhaps though, I will shoot her over the 
article I wrote on radio sweep.  It was included in the most recent AAEVP news journal and 
seemed to be received well, even by those previously unopen to the idea of the validity of 
this technique.

&gt; Hi Guys, here&#x27;s a site I thought you all would be interested in...this site is dogging the 
works being done. She is a 20 year old lady that has a paranormal group in England. I 
think she needs some educating. Anyone interested? Here is her link to her site.

&gt; haunt a few of you guys so can get some good evidence. I&#x27;ll make you

&gt; &gt; FYI to all our members, check this stie out, especially near the 
&gt; bottom where the Vatican is discussed.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also, how about we all form a pact!!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If any of us dies, we set up a group on the other side like ours 
&gt; to work with us earth bounders. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any takers!!!!
