pay attention to the box when i turn it on.

&gt; Nick,

&gt; My advice as a long time researcher is not to just turn the box on  
&gt; and leave it running
&gt; unless you intend to do a session and give your friends on the  
&gt; other side that are working
&gt; extremely hard to send you the communication your undivided attention.
&gt;
&gt; It&#x27;s kind of like calling someone on the phone and when they start  
&gt; a conversation you decide to
&gt; put the phone down and focus your attention on other things.
&gt;
&gt; There are other researchers that feel that there is nothing wrong  
&gt; with this practice and do it on occasion
&gt; But I have come to the understanding that it is deemed  
&gt; disrespectful and while you may be listening with
&gt; one ear as you do something else, you will hear a loud curse word  
&gt; or nasty statement, that is their way
&gt; of getting your attention back. I have gotten numerous messages  
&gt; about the difficulty of the attempts for
&gt; them to communicate so when I turn the box on it gets my full  
&gt; attention. just some experienced advice.
&gt;
&gt; As for them telling you to close the portal, it could have two  
&gt; meanings. Sometimes they refer to box that
&gt; is turned on and in use as a portal for the simple reason that each  
&gt; time we turn a box on to communicate
&gt; it opens a direct open link between our realm and theirs so in  
&gt; essence it is an open door for anything to pass in or out.
&gt;
&gt; that is why when I end a session I always ask my technician to  
&gt; bring back any spirits that may have come through the
&gt; portal during the session and I ask for conformation and 10 times  
&gt; out of ten will get &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;OK THEY ARE BACK&quot;
&gt;
&gt; also they may have meant since you had the box running and where  
&gt; not doing a actual session to shut the box so
&gt; that they could go and not have to protect the open connection from  
&gt; any negative entities that where able cross through the open
&gt; portal.
&gt;
&gt; A few researchers have been receiving numerous messages about the  
&gt; number 7 within the past month. The only known
&gt; significance that the number 7 has in evp research is the 7  
&gt; entities that controlled communication back in the eighties and  
&gt; nineties
&gt; during the spiricom and luxembourg era. To receive this number in  
&gt; messages so often and by more than one researcher, odiously
&gt; holds some importance which they have not been able or are not  
&gt; ready to convey.
&gt;
&gt; If you need any help or have any questions please feel free to ask.

&gt;
&gt; Hey,
&gt; Anyone have any odd problems in the morning with using it. I am
&gt; sitting here checking my email so i just thought i&#x27;d turn it on
&gt; and... not check my email. Anywho.... Then right at about 6:20 i
&gt; heard a voice say &quot;Nicholas Etheridge please turn off the dsfnlsd&quot;
&gt; not quite sure what word it used... possibly portal. I just thought
&gt; it was weird. Also under all of the jumble and this voice speaking i
&gt; heard a deep male voice almost chanting &quot;seven&quot;. Not sure if I
&gt; actually heard this or its the want to have an excuse to stay home
&gt; and not take the HSAs.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway.. just curious if anyone has gotten heard this or if they know
&gt; something I don&#x27;t about using the box in the morning.
&gt;
&gt; Peace,
&gt; Nick
