<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce--that is absolutely, clearly Sarah&#x27;s voice. I spoke to her on
the phone when she was helping me get started as an EVP taper or when
she wanted me to do a few local speaking gigs for her, and I have all
of her demo reels of her EVP from the 1980s where she introduces each
example. That is her voice. I have no doubt about it.

&gt; hey everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I had a really terrific session recently and posted a bunch of files. I 
&gt; hope you guy&#x27;s don&#x27;t get bored listening 99% of them are great.
&gt; 
&gt; I received 5 concerning Sarah  Estep and believe a couple where Sarah 
&gt; herself.
&gt; 
&gt; Also got one Claiming to be St. Patrick.
&gt; 
&gt; I labeled a couple with explanations, something new to explain what the 
&gt; file is about.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you guy&#x27;s can give a listen these files are really good.
&gt;
