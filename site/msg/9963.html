Well let me clear up a few things  frist off what garbage to  you may not b=
e garbage to others.   When I review a clip  I will listen to my question  =
and if there is no answer after a  5 to10 seconds  I move on. Anything long=
er is not consider  real time to me.  
       as a investigatorof the paran=
ormal and researcher, I need to survive on my reputation  as we all know ..=
 now if I leave my 5seconds  of air time and post aanswer  this  is how it =
happened . I wont need to prove myraw file  for anyone this is raw, I might=
have     clean it up a bit  but basically  what you hear 
is how  and when =
I received it!!
  I=A2ve been at  this a long time  and I see many come  an=
d go 
and the one who left had one thing in common,  there evidence  would =
not stand up alone  with out providing  a explanation .  the one that are s=
till around are theone  that 
let the evidence speak for itself.  
This is =
after all what were trying to do 
it not only the message  but howit was go=
tten that imported. Everywhere I=A2ve been always want=A2s to hear  how 
th=
e final piece of evidence was   achieved and what it took to get there.  Al=
so  on a plus note  new  peoplethat are interested need to learn how to hea=
r 
the process in Oder for them  advance 
this  research..  There is   rhyt=
hmto box  sweep and you do need to tuneyour ear  , when we post  are raw 
f=
iles, this  allows them to grow accustomto  the way  the box works and how =
there eras cantune  in to  what is be said. .  Therefore I see no reason wh=
y  we would not 
use are raw files   there is somuch  to befit from them  f=
or us as well as others .
Just my view  
Thanks  joel
