My wish is that we had unlimited posting/filing space. But til then we will have to make do with what we have. Try the esnips thing out several of us are already over there forming our lil community for file sharing. With 50 gigs you can pretty much post in whatever format you like which is what we do. Some files are just too large to post here or too many of them to post all at once so we just use that instead.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Plus its easy to link up with others so that they get notifications you have uploaded a new file. I think for now its a great way to expand our group and possibly even reach more people who havent joined here or even heard of the things we do. It also keeps a hit count for how many people visit your folders so you can see what people are listening to. And it allows comments so that visitors can give feedback if they wish.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Misty\n&gt;"}
