<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ursula,

Great files, i&#x27;m glad to see you are getting results right away.  If 
you need anything just let me know and i&#x27;ll help the best i can.  It 
sure seems like you are doing just fine on your own though.  Keep up 
the good work and i look forward to future posts.  Joe&#x27;s box is 
definetely different than other boxes out there, i know i&#x27;ve used 
them all.  It&#x27;s not as smooth running, but the answers are very loud 
and direct.

-Steve H.

&gt; Received and held my first session with Joe&#x27;s Box yesterday, and 
&gt; thought it might be good to see what you guys think of what I got. 
I 
&gt; will upload them in a minute under Ursula- Joe&#x27;s Box. 
&gt; 
&gt; The two clips are actually from the second session, which I did 
about 
&gt; five minutes after the first, uneventful one.
&gt; 
&gt; Both clips are from the same session.
&gt; 
&gt; The first clip is from the beginnng of the four-minute session.  I 
&gt; have just asked, &quot;Is there something you want to say?&quot; and then 
&gt; before and while I repeat the question, a voice says, &quot;-the fuck 
up.  
&gt; Shut the--&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; The second clip happens later.  I had asked &quot;What is my name?&quot; and 
&gt; the earlier (&quot;shutthefuckup&quot;) smart-alecky voice had 
answered &quot;Ursula 
&gt; Anne&quot; in a singsong way (This is a little weird because my real 
name 
&gt; is Anne Ursula, so kids used to tease me by calling me Ursula Anne 
at 
&gt; school after I started going by my middle name at age 11.) 
&gt; 
&gt; The second clip starts immediately after, when the same voice 
&gt; says, &quot;Zip It!&quot;
&gt; Then, a second voice says, &quot;Shhh. Listen, you&#x27;ll scare her.&quot; 
&gt; Then the first voice says, &quot;Aww!&quot;  Then something I can&#x27;t make out 
in 
&gt; short bursts.
&gt; Then, I say &quot;I&#x27;m listening&quot; because I heard &quot;Listen&quot; from the 
second 
&gt; voice.
&gt; After my voice you hear &quot;Here you go!&quot; and then &quot;What&#x27;s Up?!&quot; from 
&gt; that second voice again.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m full of wonder about this box.  It was odd. People say the 
boxes 
&gt; FEEL different from anything else, and I really did.  I KNEW 
somehow 
&gt; when I started that second session that there would be something, 
and 
&gt; it was like the language opened itself up to me.  It&#x27;s a very 
&gt; different sounding sort of thing from anything else.  I can&#x27;t 
really 
&gt; describe it.  It&#x27;s much, much different from anything I&#x27;ve done 
&gt; before and quite Awe-some in a literal sense.
&gt; 
&gt; I was also very surprised that I wasn&#x27;t at all afraid of whatever 
&gt; idiot was swearing and saying stupid things.  Like a bully on a 
&gt; playground, really.  Nothing scarier than that.  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, Steve, for giving me the chance to experience this tool.  
And 
&gt; thanks, Frank, dear Frank who I&#x27;ve never met, for having the box 
idea 
&gt; in the first place.
&gt; 
&gt; Ursula
