      While some codes are used differently, many are used the same.
All th=

Can y=

Code 7 is either code for being out of s=
ervice (short for 10-7), or a meal break:

      Tonight at work I was talking to a state trooper, ther=
e had been an accident. I asked him if there were any deaths (it was very v=
ery bad) and he said he didnt know so he got on his radio and called in and=
 asked them if it was a 7 at the site. They told him negative, and he told =
me the little boy who was the worst off was still alive. I asked him why di=
d you ask them if it was a 7. He said code 7, I was asking them if they wer=
e dead. So if you ever hear anyone call 7 over the radio that means someone=
s dead.
=A0
Just thought I would pass that on. I find it interesting since =
I know alot of us have heard this before when used to describe who is speak=
ing rather than a name they say seven.
