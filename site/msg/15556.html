Not my message to Frank was not that, it was about spirit that wanted to  
talk to him,  who are you LK?  You are jumping the gun a bit are you  not?  
As I explained already, my note to Frank although it is not anyone's  
business, went like this:
 
 I'm sure if a comet hit the Earth (God forbid), Bruce would save your  
life or you would save his Frank if need be.  God Bless Us one and  all, sf
