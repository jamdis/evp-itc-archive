My answer would be yes you pretty much have everything \nwhich is the recording device and the software on your pc to analyze \nyour files. \n&gt; \n&gt; As for why some files are fine and others are not I find that when \na file doesnt play directly its easier to just download it and play \nit in audacity or whatever.\n&gt; \n&gt; Give it a try and see what ya get.\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 6/25/08, earthangel5998 &lt;harris5998@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: earthangel5998 &lt;harris5998@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Newbie Intro and Questions\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Wednesday, June 25, 2008, 2:59 PM\n&gt; &gt; Hi everyone, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My name is Angela, I am 30 years old, married mother of\n&gt; &gt; two. Been \n&gt; &gt; interested in the paranormal for as long as I can remember.\n&gt; &gt; Was \n&gt; &gt; recently in an investigation group but the leader was a\n&gt; &gt; very pushy, \n&gt; &gt; obnoxious individual that basically scared everyone off.\n&gt; &gt; Anyway...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was listening to some of the files. Nice work! However\n&gt; &gt; some of them \n&gt; &gt; won&#39;t open, when I try to open some of them I get a\n&gt; &gt; message that \n&gt; &gt; says &quot;Windows Media Player cannot find the file&quot;\n&gt; &gt; or cannot open the \n&gt; &gt; file something like that...anyone know why some files play\n&gt; &gt; and others \n&gt; &gt; won&#39;t? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also...I am interested in capturing EVPs myself. However I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have \n&gt; &gt; much equipment. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a computer of course, and a pair of stereo quality\n&gt; &gt; headphones \n&gt; &gt; with microphone attached (like the kind a call center would\n&gt; &gt; use) My \n&gt; &gt; computer is right next to our air conditioner so that could\n&gt; &gt; provide \n&gt; &gt; the &quot;white noise&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Could I possibly record with nothing more than a headphone\n&gt; &gt; mouthpiece \n&gt; &gt; and a freeware program like Audacity? Or do I need\n&gt; &gt; something more \n&gt; &gt; extensive? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also are there any risks of doing EVP in one&#39;s home? I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t suspect \n&gt; &gt; paranormal activity here but I read Tom and Lisa\n&gt; &gt; Butler&#39;s book &quot;There \n&gt; &gt; is No Death and There are No Dead&quot; where they talk\n&gt; &gt; about making \n&gt; &gt; contact with &quot;The Other Side&quot; even in locations\n&gt; &gt; that are \n&gt; &gt; not &quot;haunted&quot; such as one&#39;s home. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any suggestions, tips, advice, input would be greatly\n&gt; &gt; appreciated!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks! \n&gt; &gt; Angela\n&gt;"}
