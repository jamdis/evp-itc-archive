<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I wouldn&#x27;t say forget everything, just add to what you think you 
know already. The boxes don&#x27;t invalidate the older methods, and I 
still use all methods from time to time. It still comes fown to 
giving the sprits/entities something to make a voices out of.
