I&#39;ve had great \nsucess with the standard recording style of using a handheld digital \nrecorder. I have over 1,200 clips to date but needed a better way of \nrecording evp&#39;s. So I have purchased many microphones, a mixing board \netc and it works great!I also have a Spiritcom and am slowly conducting \nexperiments to improve the sound quality. This type of device allows \ntwo way communication but does not use a radio device. It uses only \nnaturally occuring sound. I had read about the ITC and I made a simple \npvc tube echo chamber and found the voices very clear from the \nrecordings. The first one I got was a female saying &quot;I hear you in \nPlymouth.&quot; I frequently go to burrial hill in Plymouth Mass where so \nmany 17th and 18th century graves are.This was a very clear voice. I \nwill post it when I figure out how. I am experimenting with all kinds \nof techniques using the echo chamber and mics but the manual turning of \nthe volume on my short wave radio is just great.That&#39;s how I got the \nfirst voice."}
