<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I know that 99.9 percent of all NDEs are positive experiences. You  
have a few people who discuss hell-like situations but that is almost  
nil percent.

I&#x27;m not really a big fan of mediums &quot;freeing&quot; trapped souls. I think  
it says more about the medium than the soul. That&#x27;s my opinion and  
I&#x27;ve had a lot of years in parapsychology to form it. I&#x27;m not trying  
to ruffle anyone&#x27;s feathers. I haven&#x27;t been posting here a lot for a  
while, so you don&#x27;t know me. Really, I am not ever disrespecting  
anyone&#x27;s opinion, just disgreeing with it. :)


What you write about the Gettysburg hauntings is speculation that I  
agree with, but I still don&#x27;t see any connection to the Fish Group  
and NDEs.

&gt; While it is true that the NDE can be a positive experience, it is  
&gt; not so for everyone. The trauma that induced the NDE is something  
&gt; can attract entities.
&gt;
&gt; i am not saying that the &quot;fish people&quot; are a negative entity. Not  
&gt; at all. They are most likely an entity who is isolated and alone.  
&gt; They are an entity who very well may have a lower vibration that  
&gt; can prevent them from moving towards the light. In fact, on their  
&gt; level, there is no sense of light at all. Most of the earth bounds  
&gt; are actually spirits who are in basically a mono-dimensional  
&gt; universe. In a  singular dimension. Their own dimension. In fact,  
&gt; until spiritual assistance is offered from both sides of the veil,  
&gt; they will remain trapped. They know no dimension, nor depth,  
&gt; height, width, breadth or even light. Some are trapped in either  
&gt; total darkness or trapped in a form of mist or fog.
&gt;
&gt; You might be interested in listening to some tapes that have been  
&gt; made of trance mediums who have assisted with their rescue.  If you  
&gt; are, let me know and I will send you the URL.
&gt;
&gt; What you are referring to about Gettysburg are NOT psychic  
&gt; impressions. Impressions is when a traumatic event took place and  
&gt; the event will replay over and over again. in fact, in some cases,  
&gt; the event can even be timed.

&gt; I would reason that since the majority of people experience such  
&gt; positive outcomes from an NDE--it is in the whole a positive  
&gt; experience for almost every person who has one--it would not  
&gt; provide the necessary negative energy for purportedly negative  
&gt; entities to feed off. In fact, the majority of NDEers are  
&gt; transformed in a very positive way indeed. Rarified, even. Seems  
&gt; like an odd food choice for the Fishes.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; We don&#x27;t know why we see hauntings such as at Gettysburg. We may be  
&gt; seeing/hearing an emotionless &quot;tape recording&quot; or we may be seeing/ 
&gt; hearing humans who died there who have not moved on. Only in the  
&gt; last case is there the possibility of negative emotions/energy. In  
&gt; either case, we cannot compare this to the Fish Group phenomenon.

&gt;&gt; It could very well be because the NDE brings with it such deep  
&gt;&gt; emotions. Whenever you come across deep emotions you are likely  
&gt;&gt; (but not always) to find some sort of spirit attachment which can  
&gt;&gt; bring additional problems. Spirits often attachment themselves to  
&gt;&gt; locations or even people who have survived deep personal traumas.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That is one reason why some people still see drill formations by  
&gt;&gt; Union and Confederate soldiers in some of the Civil War battle  
&gt;&gt; fields.

&gt;&gt;&gt; From what I hear, they&#x27;re fairly demonic. Nasty. But yes, I&#x27;d  
&gt;&gt;&gt; agree they&#x27;d revel in any attention.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; R. Smith deemed them the Demons of Evp.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course - unless you&#x27;ve truly experienced what they are capable  
&gt;&gt;&gt; of, it&#x27;s hard to judge.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; One thing Erland and I noticed, they seemed to pick up on people  
&gt;&gt;&gt; who had exprienced an NDE (near death or death experience). Both  
&gt;&gt;&gt; Erland &amp; I are NDE&#x27;ers, though he&#x27;s now officially on the other  
&gt;&gt;&gt; side. :)
