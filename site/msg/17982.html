&gt; It&#x27;s going to sound silly to you Frank, but I still have my old spirit
&gt; trumpet, it&#x27;s about 60 or more years old now, i got it from a man that made
&gt; them back in the heydays for spiritualism, it would sit in the middle of a
&gt; room, where people sat for seance, and it would take the energy of the
&gt; people and from the medium, and a glass of water was in the room and fly
&gt; about, and get direct spirit voice, it&#x27;s said, that at one time spirit was
&gt; able to some how form these &quot;spiritual vocal cords&quot; inside the trumpet pipe,
&gt; and talk.  I know, it sounds crazy, but it did use to happen, and it was not
&gt; a gimmick, Trumpets are made of a hard aluminum pipe light weight long tube,
&gt; i have a picture of it if you&#x27;d like to see it, maybe it&#x27;s the same type
&gt; principle  your using in the box. sf

&gt;    When I first &quot;got&quot; the idea for the box, using a chamber was poionted
&gt; out to me kinda telepathicly. It seems to function as a space where the
&gt; sound can be manipulated easier by the entities, and using different
&gt; materials seems to get different levels. When I use aluminum, that seems to
&gt; facilitate ET contact more often than not using the chamber. Using pipe
&gt; helps make the chambers smaller. Thre seems to be a filtering effect by the
&gt; chamber that tends to enhance the voices. Most of the boxes I make have an
&gt; option to use the chambers.
&gt;
&gt;  The mind contact that poined out the chamber--I think--was that shadow guy
&gt; on the group home page.
