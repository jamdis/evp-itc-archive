I guessing the subject of this post "Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: another lengthy post about ebay in answer to margaret"  are y'all talking about people that answer in lengthy post.  Unless the post is worth reading, and is something about the GB research.  I will read the whole post, but if its about something not pertaining to the GB research "delete".  Thats just how it is!!!
  I am probaly totaly off subject, but I just had a look at the Subject, and that was the first thing that came out!

I hate to admit this but when I first heard about the Franks box on 
paranormal state I went to ebay to see if there were any on there. I 
also did a search for Ghost box but lucky for me there wasnt any on 
ebay at the time, cause I would of foolishly paid the $49.95 plus 
shipping to get the RS hack that is on ebay now. (dont think I would 
of gone as high as some of the bidder have gone)

> Hi Bruce. I don't see this so much as an assault on anyone, as it 
is simply bringing awareness into a forum (ebay) where it is 
desperately needed. Was it not you who recently stated sellers who 
take advantage of others in this way are "no more than thieves 
without guns" and "should not be patronized no matter the 
circumstances." You have characterized them as "wolves" and "demons" 
but now are saying "do nothing." Which, honestly, I could understand 
if my suggestion was coming from a place of vengeance. It is 
not.THIS IS ABOUT EDUCATION FIRST AND FOREMOST, and standing up for 
those who are, unknowingly, being taken advantage of. The byproduct 
of providing this education will be allowing consumers to make an 
informed decision and if that hurts the sales of unscrupulous 
sellers, then so be it. Ann has just echoed some of my remarks in 
earlier posts in support of sellers rights to take advantage of the 
market ... that some people may find it's worth it to pay more to 
someone to receive a previously hacked unit. I would venture to 
guess, this educational information will A) help prevent those who 
are capable of doing the hack themselves from being duped, and B) 
force sellers who do offer pre-hacked units to do so for a 
more 'reasonable' fee. This is neither spiteful nor aggressive, and 
it's certainly not any kind of vengeance driven on my part. It's 
standing up for the uninformed, leveling the playing field for 
sellers, and it's bringing more people the knowledge that 
doing 'box' research is not an exclusive club that only the rich can 
take part in (and given the pricing on the bids for these units, 
people are under the false assumption that you have a pay a high 
price to get your hands on a limited resource, when that simply is 
not the case.)I can see nothing but positive benefits coming from 
educating people about their options.Margaret--- In EVP-
