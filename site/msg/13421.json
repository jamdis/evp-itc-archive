(and I am a psychic, lol)\n&gt; \n&gt; I did not watch the show because my group and I were actually out \ninvestigating  something last night.

I was wrong. Door to the Dead has \nexceeded my worst expectations.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Generally, I respect John Oliver&#39;s work as a medium. While I have \nno personal experience with him, in the past he has looked and acted \nmore genuine than not, the rolling of the eyes put aside for the \nmoment.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; I do take exception to the characterization of the talking box as \nan Edison device. I have documented the history of Edison, ITC and \nEVP  [http://www.sdparanormal.com/EdisonWhitePaper.html] elsewhere. \nThis is however the smallest concern I have with this show.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Prior to wathcing I had just had a conversation with a respected \ncolleague on the West coast regarding interesting phenomena he and \nothers are constantly observing in sites with phenomena similar to \nthat on Door to the Dead. None of those measurements were made by \nthis team. The use of thermal in this situation is not indicated as \nwell.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; The real concern is that no attempt was made to help this family in \na broader context. The skeptic did and said nothing skeptical as far \nas I could tell. Key questions were not asked (at least on-camera) \nthat would reveal the psycho-dynamics of this family. We know fairly \nwell at this time that PK phenomena is often centered on a focal \nperson who can exhibit specific characteristics. That the team seems \nunaware of this is quite disturbing to a person like myself.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; A real research opportunity was lost in this case, as was an \nopportunity to educate the public on the right way to approach such \nsituations. Continually sending the messages that phenomena is based \non &#39;demons&#39; and &#39;spirits&#39; exclusively does nothing to further the \nposition of serious investigators, which is perhaps most troubling of \nall.\n&gt;"}
