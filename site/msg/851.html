Yes they call it "the fountain" I call it "the fishtank" =)
   
  It's a large tank pumping water thru a charcoal filter (a bit like charli's coffee pot did). I then save the recording, put it thru the p1 filter, and listen then slow to -74% and listen. Thats the speed for most messages...forward and reverse. -30% also gets results sometimes depending on how many come thru.

When you say you use water, do you mean you run water while doing 
EVP?
