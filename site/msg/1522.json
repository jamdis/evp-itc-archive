I would maybe leave the plug on there too.  \nThey may be able to come through clearer with all that current \nrunning through it from the outlet.  It&#39;s as if they have more \noptions, but nobody is really sure how evp works really.  They feed \noff energy and it just seems like you would have more current from a \nwall socket than a couple of batteries.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a box returned. I replaced the capacitors in the whithe \nnoise amp \n&gt; that control the gain, and voila--kick butt box. This is one of \ntwo that I \n&gt; tried &quot;ugly construction&quot;, where the components are mounted on an \nunetched \n&gt; piece of copper clad board in an effort to reduce size. One \ndrawback with \n&gt; this box is it&#39;s AC powered, so not portable to places wihtout \npower--like \n&gt; grave yards, so I might convert it.  I have one more of these, \n#12, but the \n&gt; tuner needs to be replaced.\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Don&#39;t get caught with egg on your face.
