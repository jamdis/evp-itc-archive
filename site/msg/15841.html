For the ones you are auctioning off and keeping the proceeds yourself, you =
might have other options if people paying too much bothers you:

1) Remove =
them from the auction, and raffle them instead.
2) Remove them from the auc=
tion, put a fixed price on them, and sell them yourself.
3) After the aucti=
on, give the person back some of their money, if you think they overpaid.

=
Of course, if it doesn't really bother you, just keep the money :)

 Yeah but......they did an auction at the =

Supposedly they want one box for charity, and I can auction m=
ore off and keep the money, that's the ones I think people will try to pay =
too much for.
