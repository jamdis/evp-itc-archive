I think I paid attention during  science class =

. Stars don't really cluster, 
gravity would force them to collide.  A star=
 cluster is an optical illusion 
when we see stars apparently together in  =
the night sky.

Here's a quote from the NASA website:

Comet  Elenin should=
 be at its brightest shortly before the time of its 
closest  approach to E=
arth on Oct. 16 of this year. At its closest point, it 
will be 35  million=
 kilometers (22 million miles) from us. Can this icy 
interloper  influence=
 us from where it is, or where it will be in the future? What 
about  this =
celestial object inspiring some shifting of the tides or even 
tectonic  pl=
ates here on Earth? There have been some incorrect Internet 
speculations  =
that external forces could cause comet Elenin to come closer.

"Comet  Elen=
in will not encounter any dark bodies that could perturb its 
orbit, nor  w=
ill it influence us in any way here on Earth," said Yeomans. "It 
will get =
no  closer to Earth than 35 million kilometers [about 22 million 
miles].  =
"

"Comet Elenin will not only be far away, it is also on the small side  f=
or 
comets," said Yeomans. "And comets are not the most densely-packed obje=
cts  
out there. They usually have the density of something akin to loosely=
 packed 
 icy dirt.

"So you've got a modest-sized icy dirtball that is get=
ting no  closer than 
35 million kilometers," said Yeomans. "It will have a=
n  immeasurably 
miniscule influence on our planet. By comparison, my subco=
mpact  automobile exerts 
a greater influence on the ocean's tides than com=
et Elenin  ever will."

I'll  go with the scientist rather than the doomsday  theolo=
gian.
