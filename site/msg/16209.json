Or in another lifetime \n    entirely?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n    &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n    &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;!--End group email --&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0143_01CA4D7A.08A23F00--"}
