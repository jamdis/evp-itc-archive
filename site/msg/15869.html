<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, do you think the lack of inter-station noise makes for more solid voice formation from the fragment material, or just that it makes the voices easier to hear (and doesnt make a difference to the formation depth / quality) ?
Im asking as I was pondering what makes the voices actually &quot;form&quot; better from the fragments.

&gt;  Yeah, the TRF radio has none of the in between station noise, but there&#x27;s still a draw back, the broadcast fragments tend to be longer.
&gt; 
&gt;  Where I&#x27;m at even the 469 has lots of noise.

&gt; &gt; Thanks Frank for the clarification.
&gt; &gt; I havent played with TRF chips for years, but I remember they were dead silent in between stations, which has to be good. I seem to remember the selectivity wasnt too good, but I may have had too much gain happening.
&gt; &gt; Presently been playing with a head-less 12-469, which seems quite good and also quiet in between stations. I guess you rate the MK484 better due to it having no mixer noise?
&gt; &gt; I found an article on the ZN414, and thought I should share it, as its got a new slant on RF Gain control, by tapping down the AGC feedback via a pot. It should allow much greater control of the chips response to strong signals. The cct in question is shown down the page here ....

&gt; &gt; &gt;  I used a different op amp, the LM358, but everything else is the same.  You
&gt; &gt; &gt; could use a LM324 from Radio Shack as well.
