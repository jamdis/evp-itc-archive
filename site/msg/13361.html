        I found the book.

        It is cal=
led "The Diary and Sundry Observations of Thomas Alva Edison"  the copyrigh=
t for the edition I have is 1948.  Since only a limited number of 1st print=
ings have Chapter 8, "The Realms Beyond", then I suspect 1948 would be the =
date of the first printing.

        Each chapter ends with the year Mr. Ed=
ison wrote it (it is primarily his diary).  The part about spirit communica=
tion is dated 1922.

        Obviously a 61 year old book is a bit fragile =
so I'll start trying to scan those pages but I'm not going to hurt the book=
 for it.

        I suppose I just post them as JPGs in an email?  There is=
 not a place to upload files here is there?  Well I know there is but I tho=
ught we were not supposed to use it.

          Thanks for the link! Very inte=

                          I have one of a handful =
of the Edison Autobiography that has the last chapter with his thoughts on =
the great beyond.  His family had that version of the biography recalled an=
d reissued it without the last chapter.

                          Anyway i=
n this last chapter, Edison alludes to a way to communicate with the dead b=
ut he never says he did it.  He simply hypothesizes on how it could be done=
 and the fact that the dead are just on a different wavelength than the liv=
ing.

                          Sorry, no links...  This is from that old f=
ashioned thing called a book :))

                          I can tell you =
how to find your own copy though if you wish.  I need to find the actual pa=
ge count from my copy but I went to amazon's used books and asked every sel=
ler how many pages their copy was.  The first one to respond with the corre=
ct (bigger) number, that was the one I bought.

                          D=
on

                          PS but don't spend alot.  The info in the las=
t chapter is not worth much.
