Today on the phone a friend mentioned it to me. Maybe this\nis that Seth coming through? who knows?\n\nThanks to everyone on their insites and suggestions in regards to this.\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, leongbabe@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Could it be Seth, the spirit guide from the popular &quot;Seth Speaks&quot; \nseries by \n&gt; Jane Roberts (a best-selling book which I think came out in  the\nearly 1980s), \n&gt; or could it be people are pk&#39;ing this name?  These  new instruments are \n&gt; fascinating and I have been experimenting with both the Puck  and\nthe Ovilus.  BTW \n&gt; I&#39;ve never gotten the name &quot;Seth&quot;, but have received  the name &quot;George&quot; \n&gt; repeatedly on the battlefields in Gettysburg.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Just my thoughts,\n&gt; Sharon from SFGS\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **************Looking for simple solutions to your real-life financial \n&gt; challenges?
