<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s like DAH!!! Why I not think about this!? Setup an internet server 
(somehow) and connect a box to the internet to run 24/7----LIVE. Or make 
coordinated short tests so remote reception can be compared to local. It 
would be an easy task to make modes and bands switchable remotely as well. 
What about multiple boxes?


Just imagine, a box accessible to the world 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week! It staggers the imagination! Given the nature of the voices and 
contacts, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if several people could access the system 
at the exact same time, yet all receive personal communications.

Guess that would create wee ripple in the darkside!!

I wasn&#x27;t sure if the originator of the idea wanted his name out there, I 
took it off.

&gt; &gt; There&#x27;s no way I can stop making boxes, I just don&#x27;t have the
&gt;resuources to
&gt; &gt; supply them to everyone that wants at this time, plus trying ot find
&gt;waay to
&gt; &gt; make the things more better. I am no engineer, and it takes a while to
&gt; &gt; figure things out--as with all aspects of this life.

&gt;Hey Frank,
&gt;
&gt;Its me again
&gt;
&gt;I haven&#x27;t had much time to work on ITC lately but I&#x27;m interested in
&gt;taking a slightly different approach using a quantum random number
&gt;generator (unless its cost prohibitive) and computer (hoping it
&gt;doesn&#x27;t get fried).
&gt;
&gt;But... what are your thoughts on this:
&gt;
&gt;What if we hooked up one of your boxes to the internet for remote
&gt;users to attempt interaction with?  Leaning on the non-locality theory.
&gt;
&gt;Couple things I&#x27;m wondering about, assuming it works:
&gt;
&gt;- Would the box work &quot;better&quot; physically present at a &quot;high energy&quot;
&gt;location?  I&#x27;m refering to locations on Earth that are known to be
&gt;high energy from lay lines, etc. &quot;portals&quot;.
&gt;- Will the recorded audio from your box be the same recorded or heard
&gt;audio at the remote location?  Meaning will the EVP be recordable at
&gt;your location or only the remote users location?  Or if both, will
&gt;they match?
&gt;
&gt;Just some things I&#x27;ve been thinking about lately.  Curious what you think.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

&gt;
