<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>For me the tricky part was getting the pins lined up to go back into
the edge connector after the mute pin has been cut /removed. It&#x27;s easy
to misalign them and bend one by accident. -Bill

&gt; Thanks Joel.  I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the problem anymore, though, as
the leads appear to be intact.

&gt;     After viewing Mike&#x27;s RS 12-469 hack video for the fifth time I felt 
&gt;     ready to take the plunge myself, so yesterday while dh was
picking up 
&gt;     a pizza at Papa John&#x27;s I sneaked next door and bought the radio. He 
&gt;     couldn&#x27;t stop complaining about how I&#x27;d wasted money on a perfectly 
&gt;     good piece of equipment only to wreck it for my dumb hobby, but
once 
&gt;     we got home he took it upon himself to test it and make sure it 
&gt;     worked. For some reason it really DIDN&#x27;T work, so he took it
back to 
&gt;     RS and exchanged it for another one, and after making sure THAT one 
&gt;     worked he even offered to help me with the modification. &quot;No
thanks&quot; 
&gt;     I told him. &quot;I think I need to do this myself.&quot; 
&gt; 
&gt;     I can&#x27;t pretend the process went as smoothly as I&#x27;d hoped, but 
&gt;     finally I was done and making the last turn in the second screw of 
&gt;     the circuit board.. and then.. The whole thing flew out of my hands 
&gt;     and both battery wires ripped away from their soldered ends in the 
&gt;     casing. It was all Bob could do to keep from gleefully yelling &quot;I 
&gt;     knew you were going to break it!&quot; But then I guess he felt bad 
&gt;     because he ran down to Walmart and got a soldering iron and solder 
&gt;     and spent an hour trying to put it all back together for me. 
&gt; 
&gt;     It&#x27;s dead as a doornail, and I&#x27;m thinking that if I could break it 
&gt;     that easily without even knowing how or why, maybe I&#x27;m not supposed 
&gt;     to pursue this method (sigh). I guess I&#x27;ll just think it over and 
&gt;     maybe try again later. 
&gt; 
&gt;     Thanks for all the helpful information though Mike!
