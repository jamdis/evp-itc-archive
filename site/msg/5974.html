<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Babs,

I personally have no problem discussing what I am doing with respect 
to the RS boxes, and think you make some valid points. Many are open 
to ideas/theories, etc.

However, I suspect your posts come off a bit &quot;bullying.&quot;  I 
understand it being difficult to express one&#x27;s feelings/intent 
through a keyboard, but perhaps your style or maybe zeal for &quot;the 
truth&quot; has you sounding a bit &quot;attacking&quot; and very &quot;defensive.&quot;  ;) 

I suggest that many here are at different places with respect to 
capabilities, ideas, motivations, knowledge, etc.  Some will welcome 
your ideas, while others will not see the need for them.  Everyone 
has their own place and purpose, and that&#x27;s OK.  

Perhaps, a group put together by you who wish to suscribe to certain 
protocol designed to answer your questions might be best.  I do not 
think that you (or anyone for that matter) will be able to hammer out 
specific protocol for this entire group of experimenters to adhere to.

&gt; Really??? Pointless? Is that the majority thought here, that it
&gt; doesn&#x27;t matter? That there&#x27;s no room for improvement? No need for
&gt; standards or protocols? 
&gt; The utter anger and refusal to post raw files concerns me and 
probably
&gt; a few others but, maybe not. My suggestions and questions are valid
&gt; and should at least be considered regardless of what you think 
about me. 
&gt; The whole &quot;Babs has Issues&quot; was a tongue in cheek title for the
&gt; thread, knowing what some of you think of me. I thought it was funny
&gt; but apparently not. It is clear that some of you will not get past
&gt; that and consider my observations. My sincere thanks to those of you
&gt; who are able to.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Time is absolutely being removed from the audio files. There is 
so
&gt; &gt; &gt; much more than just listening to the files, you have too look. 
You
&gt; &gt; &gt; have to train your eyes as well as your ears to make any sort of
&gt; &gt; &gt; judgment. The second I load some of these files, before I 
listen, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; see problems. I know the site isn&#x27;t set up to really leave 
comments 
&gt; &gt; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; files with the file but something should be included in the 
name or
&gt; &gt; &gt; something. Without it, it is not true representation of what 
the 
&gt; &gt; file
&gt; &gt; &gt; is or what has happened between the capture and the post. We 
listen
&gt; &gt; &gt; and think &quot;Wow! Great catch&quot; but we really do not know. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Are you starting the scan on your 3 469&#x27;s at different 
frequencies?
&gt; &gt; &gt; What is the ratio being mixed? Is it equal between the three? 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe that Mark and Debbie Constantino (sp)of Nevada use 
water
&gt; &gt; &gt; almost exclusively for their recordings. I have found that 
method to
&gt; &gt; &gt; be difficult in hearing the results. Are you feeling that those
&gt; &gt; &gt; communications are from spirits or earthbounds and what makes 
you 
&gt; &gt; feel
&gt; &gt; &gt; that way?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve recently started analyzing a 40 min 469 session. The 
results 
&gt; &gt; are
&gt; &gt; &gt; scary. I&#x27;d say at this point, and I&#x27;m only 1/2 way through, 90% 
of 
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; communication is negative in nature and mentions many supposed 
&gt; &gt; Demonic
&gt; &gt; &gt; names. The layers of voices are, in many cases, multiple. 
Often, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; listener hears very little of what is actually said. The voices 
can 
&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; mocking or downright crude. I have not yet formed an opinion 
fully 
&gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; it would seem to me that these models are easy devices for 
lower 
&gt; &gt; level
&gt; &gt; &gt; entities to figure out how to use. I can not speak of the 
attitudes 
&gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt; fears of those investigators present although at times, their 
voices
&gt; &gt; &gt; are a bit shaky.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Very good observation Babs. Let me say that you have many 
friends
&gt; &gt; &gt; and associates here just for the simple fact that you have an 
&gt; &gt; interest
&gt; &gt; &gt; in ITC, are a researcher and a complex thinker. I think we have 
&gt; &gt; shown
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the past that we can have a disagreement and still remain 
&gt; &gt; friends.
&gt; &gt; &gt; You make a lot of good points in your post and I would like to 
know
&gt; &gt; &gt; who removes time from their recordings. I have never removed 
time 
&gt; &gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; my recordings and see no reason why anyone else would without 
saying
&gt; &gt; &gt; so in an accompanied post.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have limited experience with the 12-469&#x27;s as a single piece 
of
&gt; &gt; &gt; equipment. I have arranged mine per Mike&#x27;s, &quot;Spiricomp&quot; design. 
I 
&gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3, 12-469&#x27;s feeding a four channel mixer, which goes into a 
laptop
&gt; &gt; &gt; running DC6 with Soundsoap 2. Mine scan equally spaced on the 
FM 
&gt; &gt; band.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have had pretty good results until recently.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At first the messages were pretty clear but I had a feeling I 
was
&gt; &gt; &gt; getting a different group than I normally have for the last few 
&gt; &gt; years.
&gt; &gt; &gt; When I would ask about my friends on the other side they would 
tell 
&gt; &gt; me
&gt; &gt; &gt; they will look for them. Well about 2 weeks ago the 12-469 
&gt; &gt; arrangement
&gt; &gt; &gt; started generating a lot of interference and feedback. I started
&gt; &gt; &gt; hearing radio static voices as I use to get with shortwave. Not 
&gt; &gt; voice
&gt; &gt; &gt; fragments but voices made of static (metallic and robotic). 
They 
&gt; &gt; were
&gt; &gt; &gt; breaking through the sweeping. I had a feeling someone else was 
&gt; &gt; trying
&gt; &gt; &gt; to force their way through. Finally the interference got so bad 
I 
&gt; &gt; was
&gt; &gt; &gt; forced to revert back to a simpler method I used before, which 
is
&gt; &gt; &gt; using fan noise. One of the first messages to come across was 
from a
&gt; &gt; &gt; familiar voice telling me and I quote, &quot;your method sucks&quot;. I 
have 
&gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; used the 12-469&#x27;s since because of the clear messages I have 
been
&gt; &gt; &gt; getting using water and fan noise. That does not mean I have 
given 
&gt; &gt; up
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  on the 12-469&#x27;s but I won&#x27;t use them again until I am 
persuaded 
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; by my friends on the otherside that they are willing to use and 
&gt; &gt; adapt
&gt; &gt; &gt; to it. To my knowledge only Misty, Laura and myself use water 
for
&gt; &gt; &gt; recording.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             Alright, you all know I&#x27;m vocal and I haven&#x27;t 
made any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;friends&quot; here
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but, if we can put that aside for a moment...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirit communication has been my passion since day one, a 
little 
&gt; &gt; over
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6 years ago. I am a believer in the afterlife and a believer 
in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirits attempting to communicate with us for a variety of 
&gt; &gt; reasons. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have spiritual beliefs that I feel strongly about and devote 
much 
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my waking (and sleeping) moments to thoughts about this field.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, I am also a researcher and a skeptic. In order for 
me to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allow ideas to become part of my reality I must experiment. 
In 
&gt; &gt; order
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for me to believe something is paranormal I HAVE to rule out 
all 
&gt; &gt; other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible causes. That being said, I have some questions. My 
hope 
&gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that there are some here willing to enter into discussion 
with me.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a difficult time with many of the files here. Many 
times, 
&gt; &gt; there
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is no question included in the file. I can not determine 
whether 
&gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not the &quot;reply&quot; is an intelligent reply. Maybe this has to do 
with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allowable file size.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some of the files I have been able to download. (I don&#x27;t 
always 
&gt; &gt; keep
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my email settings on for this group as I get too many - lol) 
When 
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at the file I see problems. There will be complete flat 
line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; silence between the words. Many times the &quot;reply&quot; is also at 
the 
&gt; &gt; same
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decibel as the question askers voice. Those two things should 
not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occur naturally considering the devices being used. That 
tells me 
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is manipulation of the files. Now, what is manipulation 
to 
&gt; &gt; me,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may not be manipulation to others. To me, any altering of the 
&gt; &gt; recorded
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; file constitutes manipulation. I do not know if the reply was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intelligent or manipulated to be intelligent. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some say that they simply remove the &quot;no response&quot; time. I&#x27;ve 
been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told it can be as much as 18 seconds removed from between 
words. 
&gt; &gt; Now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we run into the problem of us deciding what word fits in with 
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question. What words are being ignored?  Did we take nonsense 
and 
&gt; &gt; make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sense? Did we amp every noise/word or only what fit?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think it&#x27;s great that files are offered for peer review. 
&gt; &gt; However, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think we have to load them untouched or at the very least, 
offer
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exactly what was done to the entire file. Time elapsed 
between 
&gt; &gt; words,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what was amped, etc. I&#x27;d also love to see some of these 
sessions 
&gt; &gt; video
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taped with the question asker facing the camera and a second 
hand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clock visible. Truly, we aren&#x27;t researching if we don&#x27;t have 
some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; protocol in place.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here is an issue I have with the RS Hacks. I have the 469. It 
&gt; &gt; takes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approximately 18 seconds to scan through the AM frequencies. 
Now, 
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; typical person would think that we can take that 18 seconds 
and 
&gt; &gt; divide
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it by the number of AM stations to determine how long we are 
on 
&gt; &gt; each
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; station before moving on to the next one. In that way we could
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; determine what is impossible to be said via a radio fragment. 
&gt; &gt; However,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that&#x27;s not correct. The scan cycle can vary from one 
frequency to 
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; next and of course the biggest problem is that some stations 
are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; picked up over multiple frequencies; AM 640 can be heard on 
630, 
&gt; &gt; 640,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 650, 660 and maybe even 670. That extends the time a great 
deal. 
&gt; &gt; This
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a difficult problem because it is almost impossible for 
the 
&gt; &gt; average
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person to be able to make a determination on time this way. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I heard about the following today; An experimenter records at 
the 
&gt; &gt; same
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time every day Mon-Fri. We hear about the importance of 
&gt; &gt; meditating,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automatic writing, etc at the same time every day but what we 
&gt; &gt; have to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remember with this, is that now we are in essence tuning into 
the 
&gt; &gt; same
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; radio show every day. One of my first experiments with the 
469 
&gt; &gt; had me
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hearing this deep male voice over and over again. What was he 
&gt; &gt; trying
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to tell me, I wondered. Than I realized that he was speaking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approximately every 18 seconds; every time the scan hit that 
&gt; &gt; station.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, if you are removing up to 18 seconds between words, then 
you 
&gt; &gt; are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really only recording the words from one station. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This post is IN NO WAY trying to start anything besides 
discussion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about some research problems. I know that there are those who 
are 
&gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concerned with anything more than the communication itself 
but I 
&gt; &gt; think
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it is of the utmost importance to attempt to factor in 
some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; protocol in order for this to be considered serious research 
at 
&gt; &gt; all.
