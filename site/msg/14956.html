<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am sorry but I know not to make fun of people but she was really getting
on my nerves about asking Frank for a Box every other day.  How many times
did we tell her that he doesn&#x27;t sell them or manufacture them.  If he &quot;deams
you worthy&quot; you might get one.  She was kissing ass all over the place.
Talking about Frank like he was a god......Which leads me to a variation of
my favorite movie quote.......&quot;Frank if someone asks are you a GOD......you
say yes!!!!&quot;

&gt;   There are alot of rumors circulating around. Another source claims to
&gt; have pictures of him with his arms tied above his head. If this is the case,
&gt; there had to have been someone else present at the time.
&gt;
&gt; I admit, I didn&#x27;t even see you post any article so somehow I missed it.

&gt;  Ron, I already sent through the article which said, his hands &quot;were tied
&gt; behind his back&quot; everyone was too busy looking at the blood he had been
&gt; hanging a long time, all the blood was in his legs, and his upper torso was
&gt; white, is what one article said, some camera guy was there on the seen his
&gt; name was Russell, and he claimed to have seen this type of thing before, I
&gt; thought Steve or someone would put 2 and 2 together.  Guess not, I guess no

&gt;  It wasn&#x27;t suicide, it was accidental:
&gt;  *Carradine Death Was Accidental
&gt; *
&gt; IMDb, June 4, 2009
&gt;
&gt; David Carradine died during a sex game that went wrong, according to
&gt; sources in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was found dead on Thursday.
&gt;
&gt; Carradine&#x27;s body was discovered in a hotel suite and local reports
&gt; suggested he committed suicide.
&gt;
&gt; He was discovered by a maid, naked and hanged, but the suggestions his
&gt; death had a sexual twist were strongly disputed by the star&#x27;s close friend,
&gt; attorney Vicki Roberts, and his manager Chuck Binder, who insisted he died
&gt; of natural causes.
&gt;
&gt; But a statement from Carradine&#x27;s representative now indicates the actor
&gt; died during a sex act.
&gt;
&gt; The spokesperson tells TMZ.com, &quot;We can confirm 100 percent that he never
&gt; would have committed suicide. It was an accidental death. Everybody is in
&gt; shock.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Rumours Carradine died attempting auto-erotic asphyxiation- -where victims
&gt; achieve heightened sexual pleasure by restricting their air supply are
&gt; backed up by a quote a Bangkok police officer gave to British newspaper The
&gt; Sun.
&gt;
&gt; The cop tells reporters, &quot;A rope was attached to his neck and also to his
&gt; penis&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Rocker Michael Hutchence was rumoured to have died attempting the same sex
&gt; act in a Sydney, Australia, hotel room back in 1997--although his death was
&gt; officially declared a suicide.
&gt;
&gt; Carradine was in Thailand to shoot the movie &quot;Stretch.&quot; He was 72.

&gt;  The spirit world to talk with David Carradine,  to see what happened, if
