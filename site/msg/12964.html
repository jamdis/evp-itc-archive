<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Dear Friends,

Welcome to the Official IPAA Nominations site. This is a new venture
and has never been done before on this global level. This site, ANYONE
can join, it is FREE, you can showcase your work, network with others,
create projects with new friends, and of course showcase your sincere
dedicated hard work, promote yourselves, and promote your books,
movies, music, TV shows, radio shows, all your talent in the
Paranormal! Networking and helping others in a haunting or a Mufon
watch, the ideas are endless!

We are working hard to find sponsorships and unfortunately this 1st
annual event, donations are required to help offset the awards. Any
donations at $25.00 or more would be greatly appreciated.

All nominees, will become featured members. The donations are good
till Nov 7, 2009 and that&#x27;s a wonderful savings and very affordable
for all to participate and enjoy ALL YOUR hard work!

Sending You All the Best from IPAA
