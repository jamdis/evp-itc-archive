<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>We are not wrong. Most have such limited awareness and intellect that they
can&#x27;t allow the box, or any method for that matter to work. Most think
spirits are somehow half human retarded zombies that can&#x27;t possibly make use
of the raw audio supplied by The boxes. Most have absolutely no technical
knowledge whatsoever, yet will tell us how ITC really works. Most can not
grasp the concept of higher demensions of reality and have the audacity to
think this is the top of evolution.

 Like Steve, I&#x27;ve had it too. I&#x27;m tied of these idiotic arguments, and
dumbass skeptic jerks.

 Who gives a crap if you accept the box, I do this shit for my own
curiosity, everyone else can bite me! This stuff works. except for people
that think they are such geniuses that they can out guess spirit and every
other frikkin&#x27; thing in the world.

 The skeptics can&#x27;t make the box go away, so what do they do? Name calling
and bullying--yeah that&#x27;s science in this country.

 Once again--the box is just a source of raw audio--bits of speech, music,
and noise that the entities manipulate into voices and messages. There are
no freaking accidental captures, these entities know exactly when you are
recording, who is recording and what you want to hear/know. You do not have
to second guess them by asking questions. Forget the white noise EVP days,
that shit is over and useless. Forget you ever saw Ghost Busters, and every
other Hollywood paranormal movie. If you think you know all about
spirit-you&#x27;re wrong!

&gt; Been thinking and decided that we are not wrong in our beliefs.  If we can
&gt; help find a missing child as so many do with $30 shack hacks, than where is
&gt; the harm and the threat.
&gt;
&gt; Science spends billions of dollars each and every year to find a cure for
&gt; cancer with no results.  I&#x27;m talking about a $30 radio that may help and
&gt; has.  Seems like we have the upper hand in the matter.  Just because our
&gt; methods are not accepted as the norm, does that mean that it serves no
&gt; purpose.
&gt;
&gt; If society spent billions of dollars on ghost box research every year, we
&gt; wouldn&#x27;t even be having a conversation.
&gt;
&gt; p.s.---- Modern science has found a cure for cancer, they just can&#x27;t reveal
&gt; it because they are making a fortune off of treatments.
&gt;
&gt; p.s.s.----Thanx RJ for posting that link for that show.....Why are you here
&gt; anyway?
