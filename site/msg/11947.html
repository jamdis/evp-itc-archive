<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Speaking of Lily Dale... My youngest dachshund is named Lily Dale and  
she was just a puppy when I was talking to the so called &quot;Fish Group&quot;.  
They LOVED her. I would crate her at night in my bedroom and we could  
hear &quot;them&quot; talking to her. They&#x27;d also rustle the newspapers in the  
very large crate I had down. She&#x27;d look at the direction of the  
voices, but I could tell she couldn&#x27;t see anything and was very  
confused. I always wondered if her name had something to do with it.  
Or that she was a puppy. They didn&#x27;t speak to my other 2 as far as I  
know.

I&#x27;m glad they were nice to her and genuinely seemed to like talking to  
her. Weird, huh?
