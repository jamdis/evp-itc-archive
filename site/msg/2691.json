Ques. about DC Six or Seven and Real Time recording", "author": "wingd_with_awe", "timestamp": "2007-10-29T21:45:37Z", "full_text": "Hi,it&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve logged on here but just popping in to \nsay hi gang! Glad that y&#39;all are here!\n\nI saw some information in another ITC forum about DC Six, an audio \neditor that allows one to record EVP in Real Time... and it&#39;s \nawesome! Has anyone here tried out the demo version of this program \nthat&#39;s now been updated to DC Seven? \n\nAnyway, I&#39;ve been experimenting with it and it&#39;s really amazing. I \ncan talk into it and some of my EVP contacts answer back right away. \nBut because I am not knowledgeable about sound recorders except for \nthe basics when it comes to editing my EVP, I would like to know if \nsomeone here could download the 10 day trial version of DC Seven and \nlet me know what you think about it. I&#39;m having a few problems with \ngetting it to work as it&#39;s probably supposed to work... mainly having \na problem with feedback and so on.. \nHere&#39;s the link to DC Seven&#39;s 10 trial demo:\nhttp://www.enhancedaudio.com/dc_seven.htm\nHope someone here will try it out because I would love to know if it \nworks for you! \n\nwingd"}
