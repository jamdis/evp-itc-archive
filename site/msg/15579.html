I am sorry but I have to put my two cents in here.
The more you listen to E=
VP's the more sensitive you become to what
spirit is saying, so it 
doesn't=
 matter if someone tells you or not, you know what you heard
whether it's t=
he same or not.
And the people who listen to Darkness radio surely know wha=
t EVP is, and
about the paranormal.
Most are not first time listeners, so h=
ow about we not make a big issue
this time about how
the audience could be =
manipulated because they said what the EVP's were
supposed to be saying.
I =
don't know why somebody always has to be critic. It is what it
is........
Y=
ou either believe it or you don't.........
 
Great interview Frank,,, It's =
about time you came out of the
basement.... LOL

Unfortunately, the examples used were pro=
blematic.

You might notice they either played the EVP, then told the audie=
nce what
the they were supposed to hear, and then played it again. Or told =
the
audience what they were supposed to hear first. They never just played
=
the sound (without the leading questions), and gave the audience some
time =
to decide what it was saying on their own.

So while the history at the sta=
rt was interesting, all the examples
were, sadly, more examples of how peop=
le can fool themselves with
pareidolia, than examples of spirit communicati=
ons.

Note also, this also explains why prerecording noises, and using them=

later for the source of a Q/A session, still works. It's a tricky
explanat=
ion when trying to explain how spirits are 'changing' the sounds
at session=
 time. But it is an easy explanation that it wouldn't matter
whether the so=
unds were live or recorded, if it was just people hearing
what they wanted =
to hear.

I realize that many people aren't out to prove anything, and that=
's
fine: but in this case, it seemed a point of the interview was to
demons=
trate the efficacy of the box. In this case it would be better to
either st=
ate they do not expect their examples to be prove anything, or
if they expe=
ct to convince an audience, to use better testing of their
results, and les=
s leading of the audience.

imho
