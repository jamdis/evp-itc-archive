<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was hoping to listen to the show but I firgot what day it was on 
until it was too late I had just missed her and the next guys were 
on. Then I was hoping to catch it on the replay tonight but the radio 
at work will not dial down 15 to where the station is =/

I tried to &quot;will&quot; it to go down 15 on the dial from 565 to 540 but I 
just aint that mentally powerful I guess LOL. 

Yeah I know I should just get a membership over there, there and alot 
of other places who charge fees for info that is public(ahem)LOL. Not 
happening this year. Over a grand on the vet bills, personal loans to 
friends, bills, and now its christmas and I was going to play scrooge 
but they are already askin about what I did last year wonderin if I 
was doin it for everyone again this year so... 

Instead I told my bosses to give my hours to those who need $$$ for 
holidays because they are cutting back everyones hours for a couple 
weeks. Besides I could use the rest LOL. Doubt they will but I will 
insist they cut me rather than a fulltime mom with 3 kids who needs 
every cent she earns and then some.

So hoping I have a few extra days off this year to listen to you guys 
radio chats. Theres quite a few of them now. Ive downloaded those 
that would let me so I can listen to them and share them with a 
friend at work.

If anyone has that podcast email me.
