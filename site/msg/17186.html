Subject: [EVP-ITC] Some offended.

 I get requests for boxes, and I think some get offended that I don't just
whip out a box and throw it at them for "their research". Trouble is,
there's too many whack jobs out there wanting to be the world's onlyest box
expert, or the ones desperately grieving, or lately, religious nuts!

 I've said it over and over and over and over and over and over--expectation
will create the voices you want to hear. If you are seeking Jesus, that is
exactly what you are going to get and you'll swear it's God gospel freaking
truth, and the rest of us should bow down to you. I think y'all know who I'm
talking about.

 I am uncertain if one can ask for certain spirits, or if even that tends to
create what one wans. I think maybe it works the same as the above. I don't
ask for any specific spirits/entities, I don't ask questions, I just let
them talk and try not to influance it. If I have question, I might think it,
and most of the time they'll answer, wiht out me asking.  That could be just
creating want I want to hear as well--don't know.

 I don't have to be on these groups and I don't have make  boxes, except for
my own use. I think the messages are personal in nature, no one is going to
hear it the same, and it's about worthless as "evidence". We get enough
that's shareable to show others that it's real, and I think that is about
the best that can be hoped for. I think, and it is only my opinion, that
"evidence" at so called haunted areas is just what is expected, I really
don't think it proves an
