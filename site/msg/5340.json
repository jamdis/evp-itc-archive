It is a little tougher to modify than a \n469 or 470 in the fact that it is harder to disassemble but with a \nlittle patience you will have a nice little box.\n\nIt sweeps smoothly and has a telescopic antenna attached, runs on 3 AA\nbatteries or an AC adapter, the adapter is not supplied with the \nradio but can be purchased at radio shack.\n\nI have not done a session with it as I only finished the hack about 5 \nminutes ago, but everything is working fine and it is sweeping nicely.\n\n something to beware of, when you remove the second board you release \ntwo small plastic buttons that are for changing the sw band and the \nlcd light they can fall out of the radio and are not so easy to \nreplace so be careful of that.\n\nBoth back and front covers remove, the front cover will come loose \nafter removing the second board and you will see the speaker. You \nmust carefully turn the second board over and you will see a grey \nribbon wire, the individual wires are attached by an 1/8 inch of \nplastic on either side of each wire. The wire that you must clip is \nthe mute wire, It is the 7th wire from the top.\n\nCut the plastic attaching the wires together with an exacto knife or \nrazor blade, just enough to get a small pair of scissors in to snip \nthe correct wire. I like to not only snip the wire but snip out about \nan 1/8 of an inch segment of the wire so that the cut ends do not \naccidentally touch to make a connection when the box is reassembled.\n\nThe modification is by no means hard it is just have to be a bit more \nattentive than when you modify a 469 or 470.\n\nAnyone that feels they will have a problem you can skype me under\nBruce Halliday and I will be glad to talk you through it.\n\nBruce"}
