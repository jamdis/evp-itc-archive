I spent the morning cleaning out wav files to clear up space and those postings just took up over 23% of the groups file storage space because you used wav format and not mp3. If you must post wav format or tons of files use esnips or attach to email posts as file attachment. Group storage is limited.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, SnowfireL@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Everyone,\n&gt; Got some new files here to post, I was speaking  to the spirit, and they \n&gt; were responding to my really dump questions fairly  well.  I used my trusty RS \n&gt; 20-125, and Goldwave for the recording, I did  not do any type of \n&gt; filtering, except to lower or raise the volume where it  needed.  You can see them in \n&gt; my folder if you want to listen to them later  but I&#39;ll post an attachment \n&gt; firstly, then you tell me which should if any go  into my folder.
