 Every year I guess, there a conference/gathering/investigation/party at t=
he Stanley Motel here. More box user/makers are going this year. These inve=
stigators are such paranormal experts that they consitently ignore what the=
 inventor of the box says. I made the damn thing, it works, I obvioulsy kno=
w how it works and how to make it, yet they ignore what I say. That's this =
weekend, BTW. 
 
 If the boxes, both mine and ones made by others worked fo=
r these people you'd see the voices posted everywhere on the web, instead t=
he you get "oh, we had to send that off to be anayzed", what a crock! All t=
hese people are doing is trying to jump on Moon's bandwagon. 
 
 Perhaps Mo=
on's statement on his site that I don't with any groups was pre-cognitive. =
I think that's a good idea. These groups/investigators tend to have preconc=
ieved ideas about what the evidence consists of, and ignore anything that d=
oesn't fit into that. Yeah, that's scientific all to hell.
