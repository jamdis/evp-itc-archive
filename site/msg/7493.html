<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Holly,

I tend to agree with your train of thought on the &quot;purple&quot; issue.   
I&#x27;ve also suggested to him that Purple is a vibrational frequency.  
However, Frank&#x27;s communicants tell him they are from Purple, a planet  
in some other realm of life. He can explain further, if he chooses.

I&#x27;d like to address this meme about no women having Frank&#x27;s boxes.

Frank has made 31 boxes in total. Of that 31 only a small majority  
were given away. Many were cannibalized for parts. Others were  
victims of premature circuit death. Some have never left Frank&#x27;s  
house. Of the official Frank&#x27;s boxes still alive and working out  
there, one is owned by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, and one is now owned by  
Juli. There are maybe six men whom I know have a functioning one.  
Exactly how and why each person came to own theirs is their own  
story, but having been around, I can say that there was no concerted  
effort on Frank&#x27;s part to slight women. I think that it was mostly a  
case of the squeakiest wheels getting the grease. Perhaps one can  
conclude that the men squeaked louder than the women and can view  
this male characteristic in its broader sociological and  
psychological context.

Remember that we are talking about boxes built by Frank only. And as  
you may have read, Frank isn&#x27;t giving them away for free anymore,  
since the pool of those asking for one has expanded exponentially  
over the last year or so. However, no one is dependent on Frank for a  
box now. There are miniboxes and hacks and there are plenty of women,  
such as myself, who have gotten them and are using them. Our results  
are, in every way, as real and impressive as our male counterparts.

What really concerns me about this meme is that A.) It implies either  
something ugly about Frank or that he is possessed of sad-but-true  
paranormal insight about how much rubbish women EVP researchers are;  
B.) Because of it, you are questioning whether women have less  
success with the research; and C.) That this incorrect idea will  
continue to spread.

This meme started on this list and women themselves started it. I&#x27;m  
sorry to have to say that, but its true. There is absolutely *no*  
correlation between the the number of original Frank&#x27;s boxes in  
female hands and the quality of our results as researchers. It is a  
nonissue that has kept being given a fresh breath of life until it  
now has taken on a life of its own. Right now, I am attempting to  
stop it not only from living, but also from taking wing.

&gt; Hello all !!
&gt; I have been lurking on the board for awhile, feeling not much to
&gt; contribute.
&gt; I am interested in this connection and communication (Thanks to
&gt; Debbie !!)
&gt; I&#x27;ve observed a few things on the board. Somehow this word &quot;purple&quot;
&gt; keeps popping up and I can&#x27;t help but to think of the color purple in
&gt; the spectrum. Does the color relate to some sort of sound wave
&gt; also ? or correlates to something in the electronic field that your
&gt; helpers from the other side are trying to propose ?
&gt;
&gt; Also, I have noticed that the Frank boxes do not seem to be
&gt; distributed to many women (is this because women do not have good
&gt; results with the other side ?)
&gt; I know Debbie has done a lot of successful work, but, does this mean
&gt; that women have a more difficult time with communication ?
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t have a box and I don&#x27;t know how to build one !! I went to
&gt; radio shack and whatever was recommended is replaced with the new 470.
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t know where to begin except that Frank recommended starting
&gt; with EVPMAKER. I&#x27;d like to build something of my own and don&#x27;t know
&gt; where to start with a receiver/scanner of my own.
&gt; I&#x27;d be so happy if someone could share some technology with me !!!??
&gt; thanks, Holly
