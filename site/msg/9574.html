<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi guys !!!
I hope Bruce does not mind me posting this.
I had questions whether my RS is working or not,so, I consulted with 
Bruce.
He asked me a few questions on my set up and to send a test session.  
So, I let the session run on its own and sent him the raw file.
Well, sure enough, it is working just fine.  I had some static and 
learned to move the radio around to a better spot.
But amazingly one of the messages was &quot; I want to see Bruce !&quot;
You can hear it clear as day.  
Also, I got some vulgar messages and I wonder about this.  When 
Debbie did a session with me in the beginning she got some eye 
opening messages for me.  One was &quot;cut the bull ----&quot;.  Debbie said 
that can&#x27;t be !!! but it was right on !!! we were trying to contact 
my mom and that was one of her favorite sayings here !!! LOL
However, the messages Bruce recovered in my session were a little 
more vulgar and not something from my mom.
I also had events in the house after starting recording sessions.
The RS box would go on by itself, not while I was home, and I live 
alone.  This happened several times, the third time I came home my 
computerized clothes dryer locked it&#x27;s control panel, the RS was on 
and my wireless router needed to be reset. 
I now need help with Audacity or sound booth.  I don&#x27;t know how to 
use it to clean the background noise up.
Thanks again Bruce (I hope you don&#x27;t mind my posting !!??)
