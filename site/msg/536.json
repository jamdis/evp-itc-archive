Might\nbe someone from the other group. I had these messages come through\nbefore listening to others recordings when I was a member there and I\ncant remember who it was but it was important to someone off the board\nat the time. But his name wasnt exactly Brandon it was something that\nsounds similar but I hear it as &quot;Bran-den&quot; while they hear it\ndifferently. So I am posting this here hoping it finds its way to his\nmother as well as forwarding this to anyone I think may remember. The\npart about a guest today for sumption makes me think its someone in\nthis group but this group wasnt here when I had heard it last time. I\ndont know.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had a &quot;pop in&quot; from them during a session the other night but\nwith all the drama things have been fuzzier so today I decided to use\na newer method and I keep getting mom messages. I dont have any\nchildren so something tells me Brandon and his friend are back to let\nthier moms know they are around.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of these are very hard to hear and I&#39;d apologize if there was\nanything I could do about it but theres not so if nothing else take\nthe message from the filename and leave it at that. Perhaps others\nwill hear more than my ears do. It&#39;s always hard to say if anyone can\nhear the fuzzy ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of the new session are clearer. Hopefully its a good sign\nthat communication will improve soon. Its a method that only recently\nstarted working even tho they had me trying it for months with no\nresults... so I dont use it often. \n&gt; \n&gt; They were bugging me to contact Sonia Rinaldi again, but I still\nhave no clue how to do that. At least this time I know shes a real\nperson LOL. They want us to share methods/contacts. I been gettin\nthose messages for like almost a year now and I havent bumped into her\nyet so I can only assume maybe the opportunity will present itself in\nthe future. Until then I just post the info how I do stuff for anyone.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not even sure she speaks english and they were speaking\nanother language after they say her name and I cant understand it at\nall.
