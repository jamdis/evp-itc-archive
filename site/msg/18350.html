=C2=A0 
"Scienc=
e" is the categorization of laws,=C2=A0theories and hypotheses that can 
ex=
plain currently observed phenomena and predict future phenomena. If a 
phen=
omenon is observed that doesn't fit the law or theory, then one of a couple=
 
things is happening - either the law or theory is wrong or the observatio=
ns were 
wrong. There are codified ways to=C2=A0determine which of those it=
 was and to either 
re-do the experiment with better observation=C2=A0or to=
 revise the law or 
theory.=C2=A0Same if a prediction doesn't happen as exp=
ected. Science has no emotions 
or opinions=C2=A0to it.

"Scientists" are h=
uman and can=C2=A0have opinions and emotions and=C2=A0faults and get 
into =
being authority figures, etc. Frank, I think you have "science" and 
"scien=
tists" confused. It looks to me like your complaints are with 
"scientists,=
" who are not in fact scientists at all if they are interjecting 
opinions =
and authoritarianism. A real scientist will do what I outlined in the 
firs=
t paragraph. No opinions. No name-calling. No skepticism.

Technology is th=
e APPLICATION of a science. James Clerk Maxwell's A Treatise on 
Electricit=
y and Magnetism was science. Antenna engineering is one of 
the=C2=A0applic=
ations, the technology.

But we are dealing with something here that is out=
side the realm of science. 
Call it what you will - religion, metaphysics, =
etc. but we're looking at SPIRITS 
- something science=C2=A0wishes to=C2=A0=
ignore as it's not physical. We really don't know 
much if anything at all =
about this field. A lot of what I've seen and heard 
doesn't seem to fit an=
