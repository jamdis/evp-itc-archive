The\ninformation I have been able to glean off the internet so far has been\nfragmented, and mentions of them have always seemed to be like an\nafterthought. I was just curious if they are negative entities that\nattach and make life miserable for the operator or if they are merely\nspectral bullies that keep other entities from properly communicating\nduring a session. I have seen them mentioned in passing here and other\nboards dedicated to itc/evp. \n\nthanks in advance,\nAndy"}
