<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes it should work better, but this also depends on your location, because it will also pick up stations from much farther away, static, fields froms electric lines, it is also bulky and touching it or bumping will cause noises. This may receive better with a receiver that has a better RF section between the antenna and the receiver and or a better audio section or even filters to remove the noise and static. I saw a movie one time when they recorded audio on several different tape recorders that could not be understood, but after cleaning up the audio on each one and then running each one at the same time but at slightly lower or faster speeds it then could be understood. Here in a book there is a simple adjustable circuit that will remove unwonted frequencies. Sometimes a equilizer filter for your stereo system will remove static and noise.                                             David</pre>
