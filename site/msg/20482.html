<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Diane,
Dear Diane,

Very clear!

In the middle of the UFO recording I think I&#x27;m hearing &quot;Foot In Mouth&quot; and
then the same voice laughing.  What could that mean?  Is there any context
involving or surrounding this recording that would account for that?

I may be wrong.  It&#x27;s your recording and it seems like we sometimes hear
different things for whatever reason...

Thank you.

Adrienne
