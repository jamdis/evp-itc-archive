I feel that the\nmy minibox is a bit like a TARDIS in a way--I hate to say it has\nbonded with me or imprinted on me (or I&#39;ve imprinted on it), but that\ndoes seem to describe it. The entities operating through it have bent\ntheir communication style to my circumstances. I will be curious to\nsee if 31 does something similar. Who knows? It may decide it likes my\nson Nick over me, or my friend Julie.\n\nWhatever happens, I shall enjoy the experience!\n\nAnn\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, juli velazquez &lt;ghostchasingfool@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Congrats Ladies!  I wish you both the very best of luck and success!\n I can only tell you that I love my Franks Box for there is nothing\nlike it in the world!  \n&gt;    \n&gt;   Juli \n&gt; \n&gt; Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           Well, we&#39;ll see if number 31 can hold a candle to mini\n114. ;) Frank says that 31 is about the size of a mini, and that&#39;s\ngood, because I haven&#39;t got a lot of space to experiment in.  \n&gt; \n&gt;   We&#39;re all quite excited here--my son, Julie Stoddard, and I. And\nof course, I am really happy that Frank has vetted and approved me to\nadopt one of his babies. (I think the Purples made him do it; they&#39;ve\nalways been sweet on me, right from the start. ;) )\n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt;   Thanks for always cheering me on, Bruce.
