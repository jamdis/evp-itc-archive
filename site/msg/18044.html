Thanks again for eve=
ryone who participated! I admire your courage and  
motivation to try diffe=
rent methods, see what works, and try to improve  
everyone's understanding=
 of EVP-ITC.

If you recall, on 7/10/2010 I  placed an object on top of my =
computer 
monitor, right in front of me, and left  it there until today, 7/=
14/2010, noon 
Denver time. The experiment was for  participants to determi=
ne what it was. 
Vague or partial answers wouldn't be  counted (for example=
, just colors, 
shapes, sizes, what it's made of, etc):  we're looking for =
what it is. 
Participants could use their ghost boxes, EVP  recorders, or I=
 suppose any other means 
they chose.

In order to keep me  honest, I took =
a picture of the object at the start of 
the experiment and  loaded it to t=
he Files section (RJ folder) of this 
group. If you can follow  the link, i=
t is here:

_http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.2010071=
0.1.zip_ 
(http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.=
1.zip) 

The  idea was that you could download the file at the beginning of=
 the 
test, and  'keep it safe' on your computer. Then at the end of the te=
st, I would 
release  the password so you could reveal the contents of the =
file. That 
way, you were  in control of the original image during the enti=
re test, not 
me. 

The  password for that file is: 123BlastOff
Instruction=
s, if you need them, are  also in that RJ folder.

And if you did not care =
to download the zip  file before the test, I will 
post the final image the=
re too.

So to the  results:

Number of participants: 5
Total tries: 8
Ambi=
guous  answers: 0
Correct answers: 0

Object: A radio
Uzipped  picture:
_ht=
tp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG_ 
(http=
://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG) 

So  wh=
at do the results mean? All that we can really agree on from this 
experime=
nt  is that no participant, with whatever theories or methods or 
technolog=
y they  used, was able to correctly determine the object. We can't say 
tho=
se theories  or methods or technologies never work. Just as we can't say 
t=
hey do. Just  that, for whatever reason, they did not work this time. Reade=
rs 
can take the  results, use them to improve or change their methods, or =
keep 
doing what  they're doing.

If anyone has any observations, comments,=
 or ideas for  improvement, let me 
know. I hope to get a new experiment up=
 and running soon.  Since there 
wasn't much participation Mon-Wed, I think=
 the next experiment  will be arranged 
to mostly span the weekends.

Again=
, thanks to everyone  who participated in this first experiment.
