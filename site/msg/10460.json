Hell I could only wish to have one myself, but I know that their is not enough to go around, and also know that I probably will never be able to get one.  So I&#39;m content to have my Radio Shack Hack, without the ego problem.  That&#39;s fine with me, I feel great about being a member of this group, and making some friends.  Maybe some day I might be able to use what I learn from y&#39;all to build something for myself.  \n   \n  Later Guys, and have a great day\n   \n  William Rees    \n  \n\nFrank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n           Hi All; We have been warned by others from time to time about unbridled box use, as it supposedly brings in negativity.
