I have a linear scan circuit \nthat varies output voltage 1-8 volts by a 50k pot. I am very new at \nthis, but later today I am hoping to have it working on the \nbreadboard, I just need a candidate radio to  apply it to. I was \nwondering which pin in particular it was. I don&#39;t have my 469 anymore \nso I cant look at it, and all online pics are too small. I appreciate \nany help.\n\n\nthanks\nAndy"}
