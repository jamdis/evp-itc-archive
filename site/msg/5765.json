If i had to take a guess, i would say it is the fact \nthat other spirit entities sometimes can&#39;t get past the grounded ones \nin my home.  The grounded spirits seem to be more dominant and block \nthe others out at times coming through the box.  That always bugged \nme because the grounded spirits only block others, they never speak \nwith me.  I would like to find out who is here and why, but they \nnever answer me.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Steve:\n&gt; \n&gt; That &quot;No. They have you.&quot; file is very good.

Also, has anybody ever though of \n&gt; recording \n&gt; &gt; an EVP Maker session in MP3 format and play it back later plugged \n&gt; into \n&gt; &gt; speakers through an MP3 player while asking questions.  I had \n&gt; attempted \n&gt; &gt; it about a year ago with minimal success.  I think they need the \nlive \n&gt; &gt; stream, but if anybody is willing to test it out i would love to \nhear \n&gt; &gt; the results.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
