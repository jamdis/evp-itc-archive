I happen to have an angle iron metal frame about six feet high and running U shaped around my pool just outside my home office window.  Hummm, looks inviting.  It's only being used for holding up netting.  We may having an idea there.  It is grounded though....don't know if that matters.  I'll get my swim suit on and check it out. Ron L

for one channel...hhhmmm.

Here is a Radio Shack item # to pop into their search box:
15-1859 (not sure if this will work or not)

The other idea would be to buy a very long length of antenna wire and 
add a male plug to the end of it that fits into the radio (1/8th). I 
would be screwing it into something big and made of metal! That may 
not make it too mobile, but you have to find some audio bits out 
there somewhere to start... ;)
