RJ,

I like your approach but just wanted to remind you that all of science=
 (to include testing) is based on probabilities. There is no definative pro=
of but their is evidence. Scientific method is used to determine what is mo=
st probable because there are no tests where all variables can be accounted=
 for and used. A good test uses many independent variables. Also, a hypothe=
sis is designed to be disproven, not proven as most people think.

This wom=
an has no concept or desire (in my opinion)=C2=A0of designing a valid test =
to collect good evidence that supports any ITC claim. Honestly, I=C2=A0don'=
t understand why a uninformed skeptic is driven to make the claims they do.=
 What is their motivation? Is there some deeply embedded fear? Religious? P=
hilosophical (athiest)? Phobia? Does one of these subjects keep them from t=
hinking something exists beyond their physical senses?

In social psycholog=
y, the concept of the self or your identity is deeply rooted in how others =
view you. She has to live up to that skeptic/debunker image she has built f=
or herself. Some of the problems that come from this is how people justify =
their actions. Because of her prejudiced assumptions=C2=A0with the paranorm=
al (debunker), she may feel justified in spreading her misinformaion, think=
ing that she is protecting others from harm. She overlooks the errors in he=
r research and sees them as trivial compared to the outcome.

Regards,

Fra=
nk R.

I don't think "Objective" means what you =

But the point of the test it to find a method that will al=
low the evidence to speak for itself, and that is not subject to, well, sub=
jective interpretation.=C2=A0 I'm sure if you were involved in the testing =
design, that could be achieved, to keep the results from being biased, and =
to keep everyone 'honest, as you put it.

You also said below " If a person=
 doesn't want to hear it, they won't".=C2=A0 Yes, this could be a problem w=
ith the test, unless a good test is developed, to remove that subjectivity.=
=C2=A0 It also works the other way of course:=C2=A0=C2=A0 If a person wants=
 to hear it, they will, which is just as subjectively bad, and can confound=
 the researcher with all kinds of nonsensical results, strange messages, fa=
iled predictions, and so on.=C2=A0 Testing can be a way to better determine=
 how to tell which methods and messages are the most valid and promising.

=
I certainly understand that some beliefs are essentially religious faith: p=
eople state it is true, and don't want anyone to question it.=C2=A0 And I d=
on't want to question anyone's religion (they get really mad and insulting =
when you do).

Maybe some people feel that way about EVPs.=C2=A0 I feel tha=
t this technology is instead perfectly applicable to good testing.=C2=A0 Th=
ere are many theories and approaches to EVP and ITC, and I think testing is=
 the best way to determine which works the best, which equipment people sho=
uld spend their money on, which theories they should spend most time with.=
=C2=A0 I'm not sure why anyone would not want to determine these kinds of t=
hings.

But I am now in contact with the testers and with Karen, and will b=
