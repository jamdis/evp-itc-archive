<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I listened to the the Radio Shack Hack files and heard pretty much everything you did.  In 
fact, it was a little easier for me to hear these than the Frank&#x27;s box 12 files.  At one point, 
you asked if they could use fm too and got a yes and I swear I also heard a thank you 
layered almost under it--maybe my imagination though.  The british ace one was clear as 
a bell. 
I have to say that it is tremendous to hear you having what are real-time (or our time, 
maybe) conversations on these.  Its so cool!  It just struck me strongly today while listening 
to this batch for some reason.

&gt; Come on guy&#x27;s a little feedback!
&gt; 
&gt; I posted 16 files two day&#x27;s ago from the RSbox and only got 2 replies 
&gt; and both were from ann.
&gt; 
&gt; I posted a bunch of frank&#x27;s box files today and not one response.
&gt; 
&gt; lets jump start this group with some new and positive energy everybody 
&gt; do some sessions and post the results, lets start the advance into the 
&gt; future.
