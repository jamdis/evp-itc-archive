"Proof is the rub, how=

It's not about proving=
 who or what is talking through the box, at least not for me. All I care to=
 do is prove that something intelligent outside of our own minds is talking=
 through the box. Lets get that far, then I will worry about who or what we=

The way to prove it, to me, is by showing consistent, ve=

Let me also make it clear - I do believe this to be an i=
mpossible task, and just because we can't prove it, doesn't mean I think it=
 doesn't exist either. The only way I could say it didn't exist is by total=

The result of all this is that I remain middle of the road.

No it i=

<div>Come one frank, few of the pe=

 are saying is simply, lets look at the whole of the argument and see what =

<div>I have n=
ever said you were crazy, at least publicly LOL Nor do I think you are a ba=

mental problems with this idea from the start.  Once I can get past th=
at, then no problem.</div>

<div> I know for a fact that s=

s they tend to change from day to as perceptions shift. I have stuff f=
