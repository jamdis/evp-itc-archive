Make \n&gt;sure you hang on to one of the ones that works the best for you.\n&gt;\n&gt;   I am still waiting for my tandem bike pics LOL\n&gt;\n&gt;   Misty\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   Winter vacation over! Not really a vacation, but the school district \n&gt;closes\n&gt;down for the holidays, plus the added snow days!! I have the two proto \n&gt;types\n&gt;boards complete, and funtional, at least as far as the individual sections\n&gt;go, now to test them in sessions. I must be getting older, cuz this stuff\n&gt;seems to take me forever anymore. I kept the shortwave converter, and I\n&gt;think I have a version that works better. I think I&#39;ll order three more of\n&gt;the micro boards, and combine those with home made radios to get some more\n&gt;systems put together quicker. I had three systems that I made using all\n&gt;surface mount components, and they were the most stable systems so far, and\n&gt;the most compact. I gave the first ones away, DOH!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;From: Misty Dawn\n&gt; &gt;Reply-To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Did demons kill John Lennon?
