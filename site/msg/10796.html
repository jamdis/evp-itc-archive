<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Sorry you found another reason to complain frank, but some people like 
to hear others research and what they are getting.  I know that shot as 
well as many of your other e-mails are directed at me because your an 
angry bitter person, you may have noticed that i do not say anything 
bad about you. Why would 2 wrongs make a right? I seem to post some 
stuff from all different methods, maybe one will click and move us to a 
better level of communication.  There are other things than the frank&#x27;s 
box, is that why your mad?

&gt;  Hummmm, and yet you think this group is somhow more honest and open? 
I 
&gt; was just wondering why yet another attempt at production was 
seemingly 
&gt; derailed, by get this--group members!? Or was it an outside 
influance? 
&gt; I wonder if any of these groups is worth the trouble. I already keep 
&gt; the group e-mail off, cuz I don&#x27;t care about someone&#x27;s latest hundred 
&gt; recordings. It seems like just a bunch of showing off. &quot;I just posted 
&gt; the latest....blah-blah-blah-blah&quot; Who gives a crap? 
&gt; 
&gt;  Yeah, negative, maybe.
