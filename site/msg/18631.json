If you\n&gt; believe in what you are doing, what does it matter what anyone else in the\n&gt; whole universe believes?\n&gt; \n&gt; There is intelligent debate, and then there is petty arguments. Getting\n&gt; petty does nothing for you or your cause, and only brings you down to your\n&gt; opponents petty levels.\n&gt; \n&gt; The old adage really holds true-if you can&#39;t say something nice, don&#39;t say\n&gt; anything at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Aug 26, 2010 at 9:29 AM, purplespacefriend &lt;\n&gt; purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So if someone is saying that something you have worked on for years is all\n&gt; &gt; in your head while they completely ignore all evidence and results, you just\n&gt; &gt; sit quiet, don&#39;t say a word cuz someone might get upset?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the meantime, if some chase only the dark shadows, &quot;investigate&quot; in the\n&gt; &gt; dark at night, get growling voices saying &quot;get oput&quot;--that must be the\n&gt; &gt; absolute truth!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There seems to be no way to beat the negativity on this planet.
