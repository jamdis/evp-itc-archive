I&#39;ve always wondered if the power of a\nspirit has to do with its ability to communicate through EVP. Perhaps\nlight is an easier medium to manipulate. I like doing computer\ngenerated noise played randomly. I had an idea too. What if you\nmanaged to record the live feed of the random noise, then subtracted\nthat from the playback version, so all that would be left is the\ndifference made by entities. The hardest part would just be finding a\nway to record the live feed without the entity changing it too.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  But what if one used a solar panel as a source of tuning voltage,\nusing a pot to set a spot on the AM or FM band, so the tuning range is\nfarily narrow, requiring less change in light, then see if the\nentities can manipulate the tuning(light) enough to get a message\nthrough? \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Windows Live Hotmailmore than just e-mail. \n&gt;\nhttp://windowslive.com/howitworks?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_WL_t2_hm_justgotbetter_howitworks_022009\n&gt;"}
