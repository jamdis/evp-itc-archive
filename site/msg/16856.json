I tried to hack it, and did successfully cut the MU wire without clipping the wires on either side.  However, some of the wires in the gray ribbon detached at a point near the glue at the end of the ribbon.  My question for you all is: should I buy a small soldering iron and try to reconnect these wires?  And - does current pass through solder, so that I&#39;d only need to attach the two ends with solder, and not have to twist the wires together (which would be impossible for me)?  Thanks so much for any ideas!"}
