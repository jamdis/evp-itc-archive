I love tinkering with things, but sometimes when \nmore electronically gifted folks here start talking about their work, \nI get overwhelmed because I only understand bits and pieces. This \ntutorial was a great help in that department and I found it very \nuseful, perhaps others here might as well...\n\nhttp://www.doctronics.co.uk/design.htm\n\nI feel confident enough to start some breadboard prototyping of some \nof the simple circuits in the back of &quot;Strange Frequencies&quot; by Craig \nTelesha. Obviously my goal here is to build a box according to Frank&#39;s \nplans, but baby steps for now.\n\nThanks\nAndy"}
