  featured in fortean times #108
   
  book "the vertical plane" , ken webster, copyright 1989, out of print
   
  i dont know anything about the book but intend to find out more.
   
  still doing exhausting and maddening work on spook radio.  amm incorporating exploring wire of either copper or iron off emitter of mrf901 transistor.
   
  iron exploring wire causes pretty weird effects.
   
  im in the process of ordering the best and cheapest parts to make a bunchmore or maybe just ship the parts
   
  sort of interesting that attatched mentions puharich and dicke.
   
  i can tell you for sure that puharich fell for a nasty cosmic scam.
   
  dicke mentions first century savant named thomas.   my family name was originally "rhys"
  and was supposedly changed to thomas after the inundation of Ys (brittany, near calais) in about 450 AD because the family became involved in preserving the utterances of a first century utterer named thomas who was supposed to be the brother cousin or lifelong buddy of christ and was of a scientific and analytical bent and reported many miracles not in the bible and analyzed them very carefully
   
  yesterday we listened to a 10 watt qrp fm station for an hour on the spook radio with no antenna.  its id was forestville quebec  which is so far north it isnt even on most maps.  about 50 north 75 east
   
  the only way to tune and control spook radio is with your bare mind but its very easy and requires no skil or talent.  you just walk away from it in anydirection until you hear a loud crack like .22 shot then stop and listen.  its automatically self instructing from there
   
  thank God i have my wife here as a witness;  pretty unreal shit.
