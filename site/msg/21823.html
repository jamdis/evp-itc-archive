<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Watching yet another friend melt down over passions having to do with EVP,
and Planet X. Hence the warning not to take any of this stuff as gospel, not
EVP, Planet X, any other prophecies, or statements from an unknown etheric
source. I can see the meltdown coming, and anything I say would no doubt be
taken wrong, so just have to watch. Been down this road too many times. I
don&#x27;t think we are supposed to have access to the other side, it seems to
result in insanity.

 Was working on getting more boxes done, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s wise.
