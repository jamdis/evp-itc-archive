I just wanted to take a moment to welcome the new members to the group. Sorry I havent had alot of time to post lately. I work alot. If any of you have any questions and cant find the answers in the message archive just ask here and I will do my best to answer you when I get the chance.
   
  The new gallery has been updated with a few more images.

  I am also attaching a few evp soundfiles. The anger they refer to had to do with an argument going on down the street. They were loud enough to wake the dead...no pun intended. Anger, whether it is our own or not, can have negative influences on our recording as well as other things. Luckily my group kicks most negs out before they get a chance to say much.
