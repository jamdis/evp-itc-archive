to use the white noise I simply loaded an hour of white, brown, and pink =
noise on an mp3 player.=C2=A0 I attached a set of the very small mp3 speake=
rs to it.=C2=A0 As every thing is enclosed in a small box.=C2=A0 ( a radio =
shack project box)=C2=A0The radio, mp3 player, and listen up amp are all th=
at is in the box.=C2=A0 I use a double plug in the listen up amp so I can p=
lug in a recorder, and the ear buds.
