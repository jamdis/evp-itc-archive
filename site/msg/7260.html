&gt; Ann, given I am from Chicago, I thought I would do it the Capone  
&gt; way.  &quot;You never bring a knife to a gun fight&quot;  LOL.
&gt;
&gt; I actually have audio from Frank&#x27;s Box from a alledged haunted  
&gt; Speak Easy where Al and Frank Capone decided to come through the  
&gt; box.  It was very interesting whether or not it was really them,  
&gt; nevertheless I think they would be willing to help pay credit where  
&gt; credit was do.!

&gt;&gt; &gt; I just ran across this episode description on A&amp;E website:
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;PRS explores the belly of the beast: a New York State Prison that
&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt; &gt; once a mental asylum. Ryan and his team go behind bars to uncover
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; institution&#x27;s paranormal past and present--current inmates and
&gt;&gt; guards
&gt;&gt; &gt; are reporting mysterious new sightings! For their biggest case yet
&gt;&gt; PRS
&gt;&gt; &gt; enlists the help of psychic Chip Coffey, demonologist Lorraine
&gt;&gt; Warren
&gt;&gt; &gt; and Chris Moon, the owner/inventor of the latest in paranormal
&gt;&gt; &gt; technology, &quot;Frank&#x27;s Box,&quot; a radio designed to communicate with the
&gt;&gt; dead&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I think they have their details a bit wrong. :-P
