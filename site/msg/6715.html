Steve,

I certainly appreciate your thoughts.  In the back of my mind is al=
ways the question of whether we are being Deceived.  Just for the sake of a=
rgument, is it POSSIBLE we're being manipulated by something evil?  I'm not=
 frightened, and I won't stop my own research (the negative stuff just make=
s me more determined), but my mind does go there sometimes.  I hope that al=
ong with developing my "ear" I can acquire the gift of discernment.

Robin

  Robin,

  If i may add my thoughts on this: There is no concrete =
evidence of 
  who or what comes through is what they say they are. Technic=
ians i 
  have found were used to get you up and running and i only now cal=
l on 
  them if i need assistance. I don't turn the boxes on and ask for 
 =
 them like a crutch, i conduct my session and if i need help they will 
  s=
upply it to me if needed. I think the whole idea is to find out who 
  we a=
re communicating with, maybe we will never really know for sure 
  but i st=
ill try and find out as best as i can.
