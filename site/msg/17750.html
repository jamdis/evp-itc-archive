<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, here are my thoughts...

&gt;  If the box and EVP was the only source of information for 2012, I wouldn&#x27;t give it another thought--but being that every culture in the world has &quot;foreseen&quot; that date, I doubt if it was nothing they would mention it. 

--- Gee, thanks, Frank! *LOL* I didn&#x27;t know about all that supporting evidence. Here I was blissfully thinking it was just that the Mayans ran out of space on their calendar.

&gt; 
&gt;  Fortunately, I remain intrigued with EVP just because something talks that shouldn&#x27;t be there, I don&#x27;t really care what they say. 
&gt; 

--- I&#x27;m interested in this for both reasons: I want to understand why they talk to us, and I&#x27;m also interested in what they&#x27;re saying, whether it&#x27;s true or false in our world, and whether they&#x27;re talking directly to us, or sometimes we&#x27;re eavesdropping on their conversations, elsewhere.

I&#x27;m leaving open the possibility that, in their world/universe, something did happen on June 17th, and this was one of those eavesdropping moments... or two or three.


&gt;  Then there&#x27;s the problem that nothing is written in stone, it is often changable, or maybe just a probability/possiblity.
&gt; 

--- Exactly! The influence of the observer can be significant.  But, that&#x27;s what I keep reminding people who take their horoscopes far too seriously:  Sometimes, logical consequences (good and bad) seem to be unavoidable.  Everything _else_ seems to open doors, but what actually happens may be heavily influenced by the person&#x27;s outlook (attitude or &quot;observer&quot; factor)... or perhaps that proverbial butterfly in China changed everything and nobody expected it.

Cheerfully,
Fiona</pre>
