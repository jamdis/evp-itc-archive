<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The only thing is, we don&#x27;t know WHO&#x27;s really saying all this stuff. Just
because someone says he or she is person &quot;X&quot; doesn&#x27;t prove it unless you get
something only that person and a few others may know. If someone were able
to spell my mother&#x27;s maiden name you&#x27;d have something!

I get all sorts of e-mails from wealthy people in far away places wanting to
give it away to me.

&gt; Well would you guys think I&#x27;m nuts if I told you I have a short EVP from
&gt; Michael Jackson? I was at a park here in Des Moines, Iowa on June 28th. The
&gt; name of the location is Prospect Park. In the original file I ask if MJ can
&gt; hear me.....and I get a &quot;yes I can&quot;. Well then I run this through a denoise
&gt; program and I hear &quot;yes I can&quot; then a second later I hear a young boy with a
&gt; mockish tone say &quot;your talking in the last mike&quot; (also think I hear a young
&gt; girl later but can&#x27;t make it out)*I MIGHT understand the girl, but won&#x27;t
&gt; make a statement at this time. The boy is easier to hear in the denoised
&gt; program (better than Michael). BUT both voices are hard to hear. Maybe you
&gt; can amplify for yourself.....that way I won&#x27;t SPLATTER the audio to much and
&gt; you might be able to adjust for yourself. If someone wants the unedited WAV
&gt; file that&#x27;s 1.16MB I can send to email address. That way you might be able
&gt; to -denoise- or enhance MUCH better than I am able to. I can just make out
&gt; what is said........but I assure you&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it is in there!!! I am sending the
&gt; MP3 to my files folder, it is the denoised version. I&#x27;m not to familiar with
&gt; the denoise program so I think I used the default settings. Jim H

The only hing is, we don&#x27; know WHO&#x27;s eally saying all his s u . Jus because someone says he o she is pe son &quot;X&quot; doesn&#x27; p o e i unless you ge some hing only ha pe son and a ew o he s may know. I someone we e able o spell my mo he &#x27;s maiden name you&#x27;d ha e some hing!

 
I ge all so s o e-mails om weal hy people in a away places wan ing o gi e i away o me.
