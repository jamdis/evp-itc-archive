<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

I don&#x27;t know how you would &quot;test&quot; the entities. One of the best I&#x27;ve ever
goten though was at the former Manteno State Mental Hospital in Illinois.

I was there with a group of about 8 people and the place was very active
that night. The building we were in is shaped like an &quot;H&quot;. We were in one
arm of the H looking across at the other and saw a shadow figure moving
around. We were just commenting on the figure when a voice came up in my
recording saying &quot;It&#x27;s Harold Wing.&quot;  It repeated this once and then said
&quot;It&#x27;s Harold.&quot;

Now, none of us heard any of this while we were standing there and none of
us knew or ever heard of Harold Wing. One of the people there later managed
to get into the old records for the hospital and found Harold Wing was a
patient there who died of typhoid fever there in 1938.

&gt; I am new to the group, I am a practicing Spiritualist but have never done
&gt; any EVP work. How reliable is the info you are getting, have any of you
&gt; tested the entities/voices? What are some of the best messages received?
