 Yeah, the guy that first made the hack was giving away a chip to control =
the scan rate. I don't know if it's still available. I have one of the chip=
s, and no '469.

 I was able to modify it, but it was somewhat different than in the video i=
nstruction, there was more than one green wire. You have to lift the top bo=
ard so you can see the wire connections on the other board, they are labele=
