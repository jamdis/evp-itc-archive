When know it was not any of the heat/cooling systems, those were all in the=
 kitchen area, and that is not where the sound was coming from. Plus those =
were all off. It was a warm night.

It was coming from something inside the=
 2nd bedroom. This was the son's room and was a mess! LOL! But I checked ev=
erything out as best I could around all the stuff he had in there. This is =
where it might have helped had he been there.

The Reveal is on Tuesday nig=
ht. I am hoping that when the client's hear the tap, they will be able to t=
ell us exactly what was making it. The important part is that it is not par=
anormal, and we may have been able to find a problem that they didn't know =
they had.

          To Add:

          To me being pr=
esent when it happened, these taps sounded like breaker switches-you know w=
hen you overload the circuits in your home and one of the switches in the e=
lectrical panel will trip? That is what it sounded like. A sharp, semi meta=
llic snap.

          This is why I thought maybe it could be faulty breake=
rs, though no switches were actually switched. It could be, as someone sugg=
ested earlier some electrical apparatus in the home making the noise every =
time there is a surge. I did try and track it down, but could not find the =
source. I have a sleep number bed. Every time anything goes on with the pow=
er, it makes a noise-though not like this.

            There is absolutely n=
o evidence pointing towards PK phenomena. The homeowners were not present d=
uring the investigation. These surges can easily be explained as mundane an=
d therefore we must assume it is. If we can't rule out all mundane sources,=
 then we have to assume it is not paranormal.

            These were elect=
rical surges. The only time we had EMF spikes was when these taps would be =
heard. The meter would spike, and then immediately return to 0.

          =
  "Do your readings in your notes? Were you reading electrical or magnetic
=
            fields? What type of EMF meter were you using?"

            Ye=
s we logged all readings. We were reading EMF, so a bit of both. We had sev=
eral types of meters present. At one point, we had 2 KII meters a few feet =
apart in the living room. On some taps, one would go off, and others, the o=
ther one would go off. Most spikes fell in the 2.5 mg range, but a couple w=
ent off the scale.

            It also explains some of the other activity=
 the homeowners complained about-the touch lamp, kitchen lights dimming, et=
c.

            Again, these surges were constant, though not uniform.

              What I have been hearing on this since t=
he first posting is a single
              tap that sounds like wood on woo=
d. Since the tapping was continual
              and you noticed an EM spik=
e there is another possibility.

              You could have detected a PK=
 event. In poltergeist cases we have come
              to realize that liv=
ing PK agents often are responsible. These agents
              function in=
 environments with specific characteristics and themselves
              ex=
hibit specific traits. One of the environmental characteristics is
        =
      an elevated magnetic field. Often this is a geomagnetic field as seem=
s
              to be the case in extreme poltergeist cases. Less extremem =
cases, 
              such as this may be, we often see elevated EM field l=
evels. Do your
              readings in your notes? Were you reading elect=
rical or magnetic
              fields? What type of EMF meter were you usi=
ng? This might help
              determine if the info you noticed was pot=
entially related to PK
              effects.
