She was 81.\n\nEveryone who has ever done EVP for investigations, research or\npersonal study owes Sarah a huge debt.  She has left behind a\nphenomenal legacy: the AA-EVP, an international research organization\nshe established in 1982; a classification of voices; a library of\nthousands of recordings she herself made over the years; and\ninspiration and passion that have fueled countless researchers.\n\nI became friends with Sarah several years ago, when I lived a few\nmiles from her home in Annapolis, Maryland.  She was warm, witty and\nwonderful company, and she generously let me listen to many of her EVP\nrecordings, and even experiment with her original reel-to-reel setup.\n She possessed a great store of knowledge, and a zest for\ninvestigating the unknown, especially the afterlife and survival.\n\nThings come full circle in remarkable ways.  The casket that now\nserves as the final resting place of Sarah&#39;s physical form was also\nthe beginning of her remarkable study of the afterlife.  As a child,\nshe once sneaked peeks into caskets at the funeral parlor owned by her\ngrandparents in Altoona, Pennsylvania.  It seemed obvious to her that\ndeath was an end, final.\n\nLater in life, she undertook EVP experiments to prove to herself that\nthere is no survival after death.  Night after night she recorded\nwithout results.  Just as she was about to give up, she recorded a\nclear female voice that said, &quot;Our world is one of beauty.&quot;  She was a\nbeliever.\n\nOne of her most remarkable EVPs was, &quot;Death no more a casket.&quot;\n\nSarah is now on the Other Side, discovering wonders that we here on\nthis side only glimpse.  Undoubtedly we will hear much from her \nshe&#39;s quite determined when she sets her mind to a task.\n\nThe service for Sarah was lovely, and daughter Becky gave a moving\neulogy.  Three white doves were released at graveside in Annapolis. \nAmong those attending were Tom and Lisa Butler, who have led the AAEVP\nat its Reno headquarters since 2000, and Richard Shenk, a longtime\nAA-EVP member and researcher from Delaware.\n\nSarah&#39;s last public appearance was in 2006, at the AA-EVP conference\nin Atlanta.  She delivered a marvelous speech on her career in EVP,\nand was recognized with a lifetime achievement award.\n\nThe AA-EVP is establishing a memorial fund in Sarah&#39;s name to help\ncontinue research.  Contributions may be made to the AAEVP, PO Box\n1311, Reno, NV 89507.\n\nMy article on Sarah, her life and research (FATE Magazine, December\n2004), is posted on my website at\nhttp://www.visionaryliving.com/articles/estep.php.\n###"}
