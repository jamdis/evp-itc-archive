Our unit will \n&gt;go up to 384 pF. This gives you a little extra room to center the band or \n&gt;tune JUST SLIGHTLY LOWER.\n&gt;...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;   REALIGN SUPERHET as quasi TRF  use local oscillator for sweep\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nIt���s tax season, make sure to follow these few simple tips \nhttp://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Taxes/PreparationTips/PreparationTips.aspx?icid=HMMartagline"}
