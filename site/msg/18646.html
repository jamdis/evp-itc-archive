<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I listened and I hear the &quot;Marduke saves the people&quot; ... &quot;Cause he can
walk&quot;(?) then Marduke repeated three times and the &quot;saves the people&quot; again.
Interesting.

On the second one I hear &quot;Fort Jefferson is teasing me&quot; or something like
that.

On the third one I hear &quot;Mike&quot; ... &quot;I don&#x27;t see him&quot; ... (woman&#x27;s voice
saying something) ... &quot;urge him to bed&quot;(?)

The &quot;I don&#x27;t see him&quot; was very obvious.
