Theres only one box that has my interest and Frank knows which # that is. And really I only have interest in that # because they mentioned it a very long time ago in evp. Perhaps it is just a marker for progress being made I dunno. We shall see! I asked him to hold on to that one to use himself if it ever gets made/finished. I wanna hear alot of the results from it.\n   \n  Everyone is free to post thier opinions and feel free to differ from my point of view and form your own, that is what everyone is meant to do in life.
