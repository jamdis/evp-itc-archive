<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Lyn,

I am fairly new as well but have been very lucky in that the other
side has really come through to help me learn. I record everyday. I do
not post much as I am more into the spiritual journey then the actual
research. I leave that to those here who are much smarter then myself
with all the gadgets.

When I started I wanted to know as much as I could as well and posted
questions that I am sure some members who have been doing this for
years have heard time and again. They still however took the time to
assist me from Misty helping me to go through files(she has the
patience of Job I swear, even though she won&#x27;t admit it), to Frank&#x27;s
suggestion of using EVPmaker. Vicki Talbott also sent me my very first
EVP about myself.

The recording is the easy part, they do all the work coming through. I
have a digital recorder as well and I simply use EVPmaker as my ears
have become accustomed to listening to it.

Steps that I use.
1)About 20 minutes before I let those that want to talk with me know I
am going to be recording.
2)Hook up an omni-directional mic to the recorder
3)Bring up EVPmaker and load file leaving it at the default settings
4)Set my volume to full wav and 45% main
5)Record for approximately 2 minutes playing the EVPM file
6)Hook the recorder to the PC using a USB cable
7)Copy and label the file moving onto my PC
8)I lower the HZ from the default in Audacity(free program)to 10000hz.
This was a suggestion by those on the other side to help me hear the
file better.
9)Start to trim off small chunks of the file and listen, slowing the
tempo by 10% after each pass and then speeding it up by 10% when it
gets often times distorted because I went too low.
10)Label and save the selected section and move on
11)Let the spirits know what I heard, so this lets them know what I
didn&#x27;t so if they feel something was important they can try to let me
know what I missed on the next recording.

I know others ask questions while they record like a two-way
conversation. I used to do this as well and found that I would
sometimes talk over them or vice-versa and not get a clear message. So
the other side and I worked this out so that I would miss less of
their messages. They do not seem to mind at all how I record.

Privately or on the forums do what you feel comfortable with and which
helps you have a calm about yourself when doing this. I have been told
by them time and again it is about the spiritual journey, inner peace,
inner strength, spiritual harmony and much more. Whatever your reasons
for doing this it seems with good intentions and patience they will
talk to you.

I hope this info helps and if you have any questions if I can answer
any I will. We were all new to this at one time or another.

Best,
TT</pre>
