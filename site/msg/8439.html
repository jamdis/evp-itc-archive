Hey chicka...I always hear your files clear as a bell too.  I dont know if I like the files from the 469 that much...I think its the clicking that annoys me the most LOL.  Id rather hear some static in between.  So lets see Lord of all boxes = frank? lol....Im sure he showers favor ur way =)  (Thats right Frank ur the lord of all boxes baby! LOL)

  Seriously � Austin isn�t as large as say Chicago but it�s a secondary size city.. so that can�t be it.  The funny thing is I hear my files fine.. and I am always surprised when others don�t..  but maybe they are just for me?  I have heard that can be the case.  I really do wish mine were clearer �  I wish they weren�t so staticy (is that a word?)  I use the 470 mainly because it was my first and you know what they say about first loves and all.. but maybe I will force my spirit friends to try and deal with my 469.  They don�t like it and have told me so..   but I believe they are just being lazy (and if you can read my computer screen spirit buddies and pals � that is a joke) I will make them use it and see how it goes.

          I believe Kristin is using the 470 like me.  She doesnt get very good reception where she is...think she said she lived in a small town.

You are using the 12-469? I have trouble hearing Kristins files for 
some reason not sure which unit she is using but that was very clear.
