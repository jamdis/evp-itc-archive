<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It is obvious that the goal is not to further research but to pad
wallets. That being said, I do believe that people should be
compensated for both their time and their energy. We all must eat.
However, when it is a blatant attempt at over compensation, I take issue. 
I commend Frank on his altruistic motives. I have not had the pleasure
of meeting Frank but it is easy to see that his intentions are pure. I
know Chris and find him to be an incredibly genuine person. According
to Konstanin Raudives communications after death, this would explain
their success in using this device. 
Truly, I can only see problems with the mas production of the device.
If it is true that dissonance in the form of fear, doubt,
ill-intention, etc opens the pathway to lower dimensions then what
might happen when people everywhere are turning on and tuning in? What
might happen when the mentally unstable person receives, or perceives
to receive, a message requesting an evil or dark deed? 
I can not convey in words my concern with this being produced in such
a manner. Fraud of unsuspecting people is going to abound. Ego&#x27;s are
not going to allow for the admittance that the box is not working for
them. They will deliver fake messages, deceiving people for money.
This can only harm the credibility of the work that Frank, Chris and
others are doing. IMHO, the makers of this mini-box have given no
thought or consideration to the possible outcome. If they have, they
have chosen to ignore it.

&gt; If it&#x27;s getting others to use the technology and experiment and find
out 
&gt; what&#x27;s out there, it&#x27;s at least doing that.  But right now we don&#x27;t
even 
&gt; know if their boxes work.
&gt; 
&gt; As a radio amateur, I have the philosophy that all the designs I do
as a 
&gt; radio amateur and all the computer/microcontroller programs I write
should 
&gt; be given freely by me to others.  I&#x27;ve even run off some pc boards and 
&gt; given them away free. I would tend to do that in this area (ITC) too as 
&gt; long as it doesn&#x27;t break me.
&gt; 
&gt; So I see your point. I guess they&#x27;re just not altruistic like Frank
S. is.
