One of the list member notes that we all seem to be getting better  
communications, "communication is starting to move  away from the basic one and two 
word messages and answers and becoming more  detailed in it's content.I 
suggest that we all try to  dedicate one certain topic per session and attempt 
to gather as much information  as we can on that specific topic."
 
This seems to be a great idea,  I  wonder if me leaving them to watch TV 
sometimes, and letting them watch the  baseball games of their choice helps, 
it allows them  to practice using the  radio for an extended period of time, 
and talk amongst themselves when I am not  in the same room, once and awhile 
I will hear them saying something about me, or  one is asking another "what 
is she doing" someone will say, "she's in her room,  on the phone," 
sometimes they ask what or when I'm going to fix dinner, or what  I am cooking.  
It's kind of cool, they can also shut it down when they are  pestered by 
negative people or abusive's, some of which say they are "in jail"  over there.  
Sometimes. they want to know, "when will you record" I  guess, they kind of 
like lining up to say names and such, or they say, as the  recording is 
ending, "it's over all ready" :( in a sad tone of voice.)   It's nice hearing so 
many people, saying "I love you" never knew I had so many  friends, it's 
nice!  sf
