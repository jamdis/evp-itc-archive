<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hey everyone... So My fiance and I have been into the paranormal for as long as we can remember. We recently started doing our own investigations. 
Yesterday traveling to my Fathers grave site and taking a DVR with us. We caught so many things we cannot explain. We still have yet to go through and clean everything up and see if any of it can be debunked. We hear lots of children but there were no children when we were out there. 
Also when we came to my fathers headstone My fiance said Hi Kris&#x27;s dad. And not to long after that you hear &#x27; Kristy&#x27; afterwards which is my name. I will have to clean it up because Im not sure if it is just something I hope it says or that I want it to say or that really is what we are hearing.
And here is another interesting thing...
Since my daughter has been born 3 years ago. I always feel a man&#x27;s presence around me... He always says &quot;hey&quot; to me... Well last night laying my daughter to sleep, I hear Hey hey Hey behind me. I though Im grabbing the DVR, My fiance didnt realize I was recording and said Is this on, I replied yea why, He says its funny I could have sworn I heard a voice when you got up, So I say Did it say Hey because he always says Hey to me, and right then you hear &quot;hey&quot; &quot;hey baby&quot; clear as day..we record about a 45 minute session, and throughout this session this voice says &quot;hey&quot; about 15 times. Again we are going to clean them up and everything, But its amazing now everyone can hear my phantom man...</pre>
