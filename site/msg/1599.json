I will agree on one thing that it should not be \nconducted on this group. as far as driving 15-20 minutes to borrow a \nbox from you ,you  offered the box for one week witch would not do any \ngood anyway and I informed you that I was disabled and not up to \ndriving at that time. this is a childish tit for tat discussion and I \nwill not give it any further attention. My apologies to the group for \nhaving to tolerate this nonsense.\nbruce"}
