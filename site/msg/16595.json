It has two slots\n&gt; cut into its right half, near the center just big enough to accomidate the lower\n&gt; half of a hacked 587 radio in one and an Avon &quot;SpaFinder&quot; sleep noise generator\n&gt; in the other. The loudspeakers of both thus open inside the tube while the\n&gt; controls remain outside the pipe and are easily accessible. I must say that\n&gt; the resonance and sound mixing in the tube are great. The noise generator has\n&gt; several different random sounds that might be useful, like a fairly clean &quot;white\n&gt; noise&quot;, a &quot;water fall&quot; sound and a &quot;running stream&quot; sound with a volume control.\n&gt; Other sounds like &quot;wind chimes&quot; &quot;jungle&quot;, etc. likely are less useful, but might\n&gt; be fun to play with.\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems to work, but I miss a lot---I need more practice, I suppose. \n&gt; &quot;Bradley&quot;, a deceased friend of mine said his name-- and It did sound like his\n&gt; voice. When I asked how he died--he replied &quot;accident!&quot;--which is true--he\n&gt; drove his car under a moving train.--he said more, but I couldnt make it\n&gt; out---gotta get the tape recorder running.\n&gt; \n&gt; The picture of Tom&#39;s Toob should be in my album. My omly problem is that I\n&gt; might need to speed the scan up just a bit. It there a capacitor or resistor I\n&gt; can add to do this?\n&gt; \n&gt; I like the fact that the pipe is easy to carry in one hand or on my shoulder. I\n&gt; was inspired to use a pipe to house the components by a recent episode of &quot;Ghost\n&gt; adventures&quot;--they only had a radio in theirs though.\n&gt;\nthat sounds really cool i would love to see the radio and hear the evp quality\n\n  tim"}
