Recently someone asked me the following question:

[I am brand new to the w=
orld of paranormal investigation. I believe I have a good grasp on what her=
tz and gauss measurments are, however am confused as to all of the differen=
ces between them. Hertz has more to do with the complete cycles per second =
and gauss is the strength of an EMF. I guess where I am fuzzy is in my lack=
 of physics. I thought frequency is also a measurment of strength. I may no=
t be making much sense here, but can you tell me where I am missing somthin=
g?]

My answer was that I wasn't entirely sure myself but I think that Hert=
z measures the wave frequencies of the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Gau=
ss only measures the intensity or strength of EMF generated around these wa=
ve frequencies. Depending on the range of hertz, an EMF is generated.

I to=
ld him that I would check around with other people in the field to make sur=
e.

Was I correct?

Thanks!
April
