<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi LC.  Thanks so much.  All (well, most) of the images on my site were done using my 
water technique (link to instructions on lower left of page 2 of the site).  I do have a couple 
of crystal collages (also page 2, lower right - if you click on either image, a collage will 
pop up).  I have gotten, as I recall, a dog in one of the crystal shots.

So far, I&#x27;ve found that the citrine quartz works well if it has lots of lines in it (I don&#x27;t know 
what the technical term is, occlusions?  Inclusions??) rather than being clear.  These seems 
to give them something to use to show themselves, if that makes sense.  I can actually 
watch them appearing my view finder, but usually can&#x27;t photograph what I&#x27;m seeing.  
Might try videoing the crystal like I do with my water technique to see if that helps.

With the water, I never see what is coming through until I go back and review the session, 
one frame at a time.  Sometimes I get a whole lotta nothing, and other times I&#x27;m totally 
blown away by the clarity of an image.  I hope some member here will try it.  :-)

&gt; Margaret, were the animal captures photographs of a crystal?  
&gt; Phenomenal images!  What type of crystal seems to work best for 
&gt; capturing spirits?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Jeremy.  My site is www.ITCdeadpeople.com
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#x27;s just 5 pages, really simply, but on page one there&#x27;s a 
&gt; link to
&gt; &gt; &gt; some EVP I&#x27;ve posted on 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; putfile, and on page 2, there&#x27;s links at the bottom on the left,
&gt; &gt; &gt; explaining how to do my ITC 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; method, and on the right to a Maury segment where some of my
&gt; &gt; &gt; material was used.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How cool. LOL.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I love it that she tattled on the dog. Rofl.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you have a website, I would love to see your ITC photos of 
&gt; animals.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is so awesome. I feel that our family and friends take 
&gt; care of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our pet babies when they go to the Other Side.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My friend that came through on the EVP on Sunday was such a 
&gt; wonderful
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; woman. She loved animals like I do. She owned a Bakery and 
&gt; lived
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; across the street from me for years. The dog that my first 
&gt; wife and I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had at that time was a Scottish Terrier named Abbra (Her 
&gt; official name
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was Aberdeen, as in the Scottish town) anyway, I used to hear 
&gt; Jean
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking and I would look out the window and there she would 
&gt; be,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sneaking snacks to Miss Abbra who needed bakery snacks about 
&gt; like I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. LOL. Thats when we figured out why Miss Abbra wasn&#x27;t 
&gt; losing weight
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on her new diet. LOL.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Blessings All,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That&#x27;s awesome, Jeremy.  I have some EVP of a woman talking 
&gt; to my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dog.  One time when I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was recording, my dog (Kindred) started barking.  When I 
&gt; listened
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back to the session (this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was tradition EVP done in silence with a digital recorder) 
&gt; she had
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said, &quot;Kindred.  What was 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that?&quot;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In another, Kindred barks, then the woman says, &quot;Kindred.  
&gt; She
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinks you&#x27;re sleeping.&quot;  I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also have one of someone telling her &quot;NO&quot; and I really like 
&gt; the one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where someone tattles 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on her to me, &quot;Kindred&#x27;s headed for the dumpster.&quot;  LOL.  
&gt; Just goes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to show you they are 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not only keeping an eye on us, but the animals too.  I 
&gt; think it&#x27;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great that sometimes they 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are talking directly to the dog.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I only have one involving my cat, Kizmyt, where someone 
&gt; says, &quot;Stay
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back&quot; (the cat had 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come into the room as I was recording).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have gotten many ITC images of animals, so clearly they 
&gt; are an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important part of the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirit realm.  :-)  As well, I had animals come through 
&gt; during
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting with a medium.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for sharing about your Molly EVP!  It made me smile.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello Again Margaret,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I forgot to tell you this earlier. Since you are also a 
&gt; dog
&gt; &gt; &gt; owner I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know you will appreciate this.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The day before yesterday I received an EVP. Male Voice.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He takes what sounds like a breath and says...Pooch. :)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I, of course always have Molly, my Jack Russell Terrier 
&gt; by my side
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when I record.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, I guess I have a Spirit Friend that loves animals 
&gt; too. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Grin.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
