What I can&#39;t stand\n&gt; is people tagging certain areas of research with unnecessary drama. I \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t use the term &quot;faint of heart&quot;\n&gt; for certain. As for Moon&#39;s statements, if those are accurate, they are \n&gt; illogical. Anyone can do this research, use Frank&#39;s\n&gt; boxes, or whatever and they wouldn&#39;t need his guidance.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyone can use one of Frank&#39;s boxes. Results vary. No drama. Many things can \n&gt; happen with this\n&gt; research, but outlandish results are rare and can easily be dealt with.\n&gt;\n&gt; w\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Oct 9, 2008, at 9:56 AM, Zack Widup wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I could agree that box research\n&gt;&gt;&gt; isn&#39;t meant for everyone nor is it everyone&#39;s cup of tea.
