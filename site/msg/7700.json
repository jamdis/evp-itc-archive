Actually this has been the basic idea when\n&gt;  I began to develop programs like Audio-Ed, Audigit, or EVPmaker.\n&gt;  Phoneme synthesis was the easiest way to implement this, but actually\n&gt;  I do think that formant synthesis is probably more appropriate for\n&gt;  this purpose, since it does simulate the human vocal tract and thus\n&gt;  is more &quot;natural&quot;. Perhaps this a more &quot;intuitive&quot; way for spirits to\n&gt;  produce voices than by assembling sound fragments.\n\nIf I&#39;m understanding you correctly, I&#39;d say yes.  Most of the clear \nmessages I get through my 469 seem to be more like standard evps - the \nsounds formed from the base energy as opposed to put together from \nseparate syllables pulled off the airwaves.\n\nActually, this gives me an idea.  On the low tech end, I wonder if just \nusing humming as a base would give the spirits the energy and \nfrequencies they need to form the sounds of language.  I will play with \nthis and let you know if that pans out.\n\n\nNellie\n\r\n--------------040602060300040906020802\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot; text=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;\nStefan Bion wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m currently thinking about a new kind of &quot;spirit speaking\nmachine&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The idea is to build a kind of &quot;instrument&quot; for spirits to play on\nif&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; they want to speak to us.
