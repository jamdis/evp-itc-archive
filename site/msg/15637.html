&gt; I just wanted to let you all know Paranormal TV Network has officially launched! I find it very exciting for our paranormal community!
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.paranormaltvnetwork.com/
&gt; 
&gt; The network features both live and recorded events and shows. From EVP-ITC to Ghosthunting to UFOs as well as anything and everthing in between. Paranormal anytime all the time being broadcast FREE 24/7!
&gt; 
&gt; It is free for you to join in and enjoy the programming by watching the &quot;Now Playing&quot; or clicking the &quot;On Demand&quot; button to choose which show/topic you wish to watch. We all know many of the people behind this growing project and it&#x27;s done with respect and integrity. I&#x27;ve heard of some of what&#x27;s to come and let me just say I AM EXCITED!!! Takes alot to get me excited about something. Stay tuned to PTN!! This is so awesome!
&gt; 
&gt; Much more to come!
