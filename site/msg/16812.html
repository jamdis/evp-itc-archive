I've heard the same said for the evp researcher=
s!
=C2=A0But it's not that simple in either case:

the last block that you =
reference has small print that says "Compare
the hypothesis to the experime=
nt's conclusion". =C2=A0Which of course
you can't do unless you already vis=
ited the hypothesis block and have a
hypothesis to which to compare. =C2=A0=
That in turn has small print which
says "predict the outcome of the problem=
", which of course you
can't do either unless you've already visited the ea=
rlier block of Purpose
("state the problem").



I don't think it's helpful=
 to deny good evidence, whether it is good evidence
from someone claiming t=
o have detected spirits, or whether it is good evidence
from someone claimi=
ng that people can mistake noise for speech or random
radio tunings for spi=
rit control. =C2=A0That's why the scientific method
is valuable: it keeps b=
oth the skeptic and the believer real.
