This one has a very usable \nAM/FM \n&gt; tuner that does use the analog tuning voltage, so I can use it in a \n&gt; box. All radio functions are in the module itself. This radio was \n&gt; unusual in that all the pins and connections were labeled. Usually \nI \n&gt; use a scope and voltmeter to id the pins of the module looking for \n&gt; operation voltages, which is usually 8 volts, mode pins, such as a \npin \n&gt; that is for AM or FM, and goes to 8 volts, or sometimes 5 volts for \nthe \n&gt; given band. I also look for any other enable voltages, inputs, and \n&gt; audio outputs, and the anttena pin(s). Junk yards usually want $10 \neach \n&gt; for junk radios, and many times they just are not usable. This one \nwas \n&gt; $3!\n&gt; \n&gt;  What I said about box concerns, maybe just suffice it to say, use \nat \n&gt; your own risk, there probably isn&#39;t any danger, and personally I \n&gt; haven&#39;t encountered anything I would relate directly to the box. \n&gt; However, that&#39;s not to say I haven&#39;t had encounters of an apparent \n&gt; demon kind. Just troublesom parasitic entities that once discovered \n&gt; quickly leave, not a big deal. I don&#39;[t want to get that serious \nwiht \n&gt; this. Now if everyone that uses the hack box goes bananas....\n&gt; \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;"}
