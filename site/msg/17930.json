The wavelength of these frequencies ranges from 750 to 3000 meters -\napproximately 0.5 to 1.8 miles. The longwave part of the spectrum is not\nconducive to radio transmissions of wide bandwidth. In Europe there are some\nAM radio stations in the 2000 to 1000 meter range. Very large antennas are\nusually needed. In the USA, there are airport beacons in this frequency\nrange which send Morse code identifiers.\n\nFM is in the VHF part of the spectrum. The wavelengths range from 2.8 to 3.4\nmeters - about 9.2 to 11.2 feet.\n\nZack\n\nOn Fri, Jul 9, 2010 at 7:32 PM, &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Does any one know anything about long wave lengths?
