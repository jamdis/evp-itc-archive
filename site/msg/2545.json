My name is April Slaughter and I am so happy to be \na part of this group. Thank you for allowing me to join! \n\nParanormal phenomena and I are no strangers to one another. It has \nalways been an intrinsic part of my life as far back as I can \nremember, so what is considered to be out of the ordinary for most \npeople is actually a pretty normal way of life for me. \n\nI&#39;m an investigator with quite a bit of experience behind me in the \nfield. Years ago, I was under the assumption that EVP happened around \neveryone, and could be easily captured by any individual attempting \nto collect it. But I have come to find that many people find it to be \njust as elusive as our crypto friend Bigfoot. For one reason or \nanother, it has never been difficult for me to obtain it in most any \nsituation or location. I will post examples of what I have collected \nover the years if you are interested in hearing them.\n\nI have had the privilege of spending some time with 3 boxes, built by \nFrank... and I am always so intrigued by it. \n\nI look forward to getting to know you all!\n\n~April"}
