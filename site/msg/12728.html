<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>First of all Don, most of my replies are from my e-mail as I am 
either working in the lab at night, or in the field in the day time. 
It is rare that I actually have time to enter and hang out in any 
group to post messages. I respond to the daily digests. Sorry if 
there is trouble following my posts. I don&#x27;t intend to cause 
confusion, just learn and share what I know. I was under the 
impression it was an EVP/ITC discussion group, and am merely trying 
to participate as I can. My appologies if it gets confusing.

&gt; This is the 3rd email of yours that I have no clue what you are 
talkign about.
&gt; 
&gt; It is laudable that you cut out the extra stuff but leave enough 
for us to figure out which email you are answering :)
