&gt; I suppose, just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to post every voice one 
&gt; receives. That takes up alot of storage space after a while.

&gt; &gt; Interesting post, FS.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I just like to think that everyone has their time and purpose.  
&gt; You 
&gt; &gt; receive what you are to receive for a purpose.  Others receive 
&gt; what 
&gt; &gt; they are to receive, for a purpose. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It will all wash out in the end, Purple Princess of the 
Seven.  :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; From; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_St_Germain &#x27;Saint 
&gt; &gt; Germain is always associated with the color violet, the jewel 
&gt; &gt; amethyst, and the Maltese cross rendered in violet (usually the 
&gt; iron 
&gt; &gt; cross style cross patee version); he is also regarded as 
&gt; the &#x27;Chohan 
&gt; &gt; of the Seventh Ray&#x27;[13]  according to Theosophy, the Seven Rays 
&gt; are 
&gt; &gt; seven metaphysical principles that govern both individual souls 
&gt; and 
&gt; &gt; the unfolding of each 2,158 year long Astrological Age. Since 
&gt; &gt; according to Theosophy the next Astrological Age, the Age of 
&gt; &gt; Aquarius, will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) Ray (the Ray 
of 
&gt; &gt; Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes called &#x27;The 
Hierarch 
&gt; of 
&gt; &gt; the Age of Aquarius&#x27;. According to the Ascended Master 
Teachings, 
&gt; &gt; Saint Germain is &#x27;The God of Freedom for the Earth&#x27;.&#x27;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Much to do with the Purple Princess, and the seven. I don&#x27;t 
&gt; mean 
&gt; &gt; to sell others short, I just get a different level, and find 
&gt; &gt; regular &quot;this your auntie&quot; type EVPs kinda useless. Mostly I 
don&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt; post every voice I get, just the ones that I thought was 
&gt; outstanding, 
&gt; &gt; but no one else hears.
