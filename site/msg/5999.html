<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Fellow researchers,

 I have decided to back away from participating in this group for a 
while. The constant clash of ego&#x27;s and childish bickering of which I 
have become a big part has begun to affect my research in a negative 
way.
I have been advised to retreat from being an active part of this 
group for an undetermined amount of time. I would like to stay on the 
rolls as a member but will not actively participate as far as posting 
results, files or opinions and advice.

I will however be posting the results of my research on my box website
if there are any of you who would like to hear them.

For the new members, please do not let my comments on this matter 
affect your opinion of this research. I have chosen not to 
participate here for personal reasons. I will be devoting all my 
energy to advancing the communication and technology.

If any new members feel they value my advice please feel free to 
privately e-mail me paranormalinvestigating@...

I will be glad to help anyone but will not offer advice on any 
subjects posted here.

Thank you to all the friends that I have managed to make here you 
have been an immeasurable help.

Thank you
Bruce Halliday</pre>
