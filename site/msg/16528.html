I think it's completely subjective, which is why different people hear diff=
erent things. Also why it will never be scientifically proven, or stand up =
against any tests.

To science, it will never be anything more then audible=
 pareidolia.

I am not saying that's a bad thing Frank :)

  =
  

  The fact that the operator CAN and DOES make recordings and files of =
understandable words and phrases shows that we are dealing with an OBJECTIV=
E rather than a subjective phenomenon here. Two things appear to be going o=
n though. 
  First there is an actual voice modulated signal. Different peo=
ple who listen to it often hear the same thing. The sound is not perfect an=
d is very noisy, so that would explain others who cannot hear the message.
=
  The second thing is that some people can listen to the noise as a "random=
 field", and with a slightly altered state of mind, this field will induce =
latent "mediumship" ability in the operator and he or she will get a lot mo=
re information and voice material than another listener.

  Note that the c=
ontent random fields have little or nothing in common with whatever imagery=
 or sounds may be percieved from them. They simply enhance the user to acce=
ss psychic information that, while even not being a "psychic" allows him to=
 get info normally innaccessable to him/her.
  If there is any objective pe=
rcieved sound similar to what is heard by others impressed upon the backgro=
und noise, it might be due to the spirit who is speaking being PRESENT. Tha=
t entity would then be able to get the message through to the operator Psyc=
hicly on another level. that the words are also in the noise would be a co-=
incidence.

  I work with VISUAL random fields---The imagery, while clear, =
is formed in my mind/eye system , so I cannot photograph it. Some of this E=
VP background noise may be working the same way too---formed in the Mind/EA=
R system. This is only heard by the primary operator and likely cannot be r=
ecorded to a file. 
  But some random field stuff IS objective--for example=
, using a random backdrop for ghost photos makes the ghosts easier to, and =
more often appear in a photo. This is equavalent to the EVP that people can=
 hear on the recorded file.

  I will discuss and explain random field theo=
ry itself, later, in its own posting.
