<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Nothing has been cut at all, Steve. The first take is exactly as it  
came over the radio--no amplification, no nothing. The repeat is  
exactly the same except slowed. Nothing is missing from in between  
the words.

I&#x27;ve been questioning how my minibox is working myself. It seems to  
be behaving differently from other people&#x27;s. Some of this may be that  
I live in the Baltimore-Washington broadcasting area and we have  
literally a hundred radio stations. Trying to get a sweep where it  
isn&#x27;t almost constant fragments is impossible. Mike, Lisa, et al may  
be sending things through to me differently than others. I don&#x27;t  
know. But when I slow what I get by about 50 percent to listen on  
playback, this is what starts coming up--not swearing and all, mind  
you, but a lot of words coming with each pulse of broadcast that make  
sense when put together--too much sense to be random. At least that  
is how I am seeing it.

The other clip I posted, &quot;We&#x27;re in heaven,&quot; I only found because I  
was trying to identify a nearby word and when I slowed it down to a  
literal crawl, &quot;We&#x27;re in heaven&quot; is what I found--waay too clear to  
be random, again.

Tomorrow I will run a sample of the kind of raw sound I get when I  
turn my box on.

Believe me, I&#x27;m confused about the speed, too. It isn&#x27;t what I was  
expected to happen with the mini. But it sure is wild stuff.

I don&#x27;t think the voices sound evil. I think they are just people.  
They don&#x27;t do anything to disrupt my life, which is very pleasant and  
happy. Ever since I&#x27;ve lived here, however, I&#x27;ve been aware that  
there is at least one male entity in the cemetery across the street.  
I call him the Grumpy Old Man. I can&#x27;t get him to leave, but I have  
made a kind if deal with him to let each other go unmolested ;) This  
may be him. I just don&#x27;t know. I know I am going to go looking for  
Andrews or Stus over there tomorrow, however.

&gt; That&#x27;s actually really creepy, and that&#x27;s coming from someone who
&gt; lives in a haunted location. The voice just sounds evil, why does
&gt; your minibox sound nothing like mine? Aren&#x27;t they like cookie cutter
&gt; designed to all work the same. I don&#x27;t hear the radio sweeps with
&gt; yours, unless you cut that out in the editing process.
