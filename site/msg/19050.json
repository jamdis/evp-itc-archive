It is kind of like clearing\nyour throat in the morning.  After this, for my boxes it takes about\n20 seconds, I get a clear signal that lets me know communication is\nabout to start.\n\nI almost always get this voice.  He comes across loud during an audio\npause and yells the word &quot;NOW.&quot; Once I hear this, I know communication\nis about to start.  I have asked repeatedly who says &quot;Now&quot; but I never\nget an answer.  It is the same voice every time though.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this?\n\nI ask this in particular because I was reading Raudive&#39;s book again\nand I noted that on page 23 (the section on radio recording) he wrote\nthat when trying to find an interfrequency to record on (via direct\nradio voice) one &quot;listens carefully for a voice that will hiss &quot;Now,&quot;\nor &quot;Make Recording,&quot; or some such hint.&quot;\n\nI find it interesting that the same clues are left for us 40 years\nafter Raudive with a whole new technology (sweeping frequency radio).\n\nIf you do not experience the same &quot;now&quot; as I do, are there any other\nconsistent signals you receive from the other side?\n\nTim"}
