{"id": "1458", "subject": "Latest sweep info.", "author": "Frank Sumption", "timestamp": "2007-07-05T14:01:20Z", "full_text": "------=_NextPart_000_57cb_be2_6bac\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; format=flowed\r\n\r\nThis is the sweep board that goes with the newest tuner/audio board. I made \none change not shown, I&#39;m using a bargraph display for the tuning voltage \ninstead of a meter(I had one in the junk box). So for the newest &quot;proto \ntype&quot; there is two schematics, sweep, and the tuner. This system is much \nmore complicated than I would like, and it still makes it look like exotic \ntechnology, it is in fact, just a radio, and the tuning system.\n\nI was curious in setting up this latest sweep board, something changed, I no \nlonger could use the pull down resistors to compensate for the DC offset \nfrom the op amps. I used only one pull down on the RVG pulse amp.\n\nI used the tantalum capacitors in the white noise amp, the advantage being a \nfaster start up time. Larger aluminum caps can be used, such as 100uf-16volt \ncaps. It takes about 20 seconds for the white noise to come up, and it still \ntakes one minute before the VT signals comes on. On the other hand, the \nlinear sweep is on as soon as power is turned on, and with this sweep \nversion, the triangle is on all the time, so modes can be switched wihtout \nthe warm up period.\n\nThis is how I spend my hoildays----but boring!\n\n\nFYI---- Mine!  I don&#39;t have a usable system to run sessions on, I keep \ngiving them away! Besides, I&#39;d like to keep the first home made AM/FM tuner \nboard.\n\nFrank-S\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nhttp://liveearth.msn.com\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_57cb_be2_6bac\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;SweepBoard-07-07.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;SweepBoard-07-07.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_57cb_be2_6bac\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;Sweep-070307.JPG&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;Sweep-070307.JPG&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_57cb_be2_6bac\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;Tuner-Audio-Board.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;Tuner-Audio-Board.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_57cb_be2_6bac--"}
