And which schematic/hack would be best to start with?\n\nI apologize for the completely bland question, but it&#39;s difficult to decipher what&#39;s current and what is not and what&#39;s best to start with through the posts I&#39;ve found up to this point.\n\nI appreciate any and all help anyone could offer and I look forward to getting to you all and working with the community.\n\nThanks,\n-Phil"}
