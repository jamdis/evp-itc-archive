That's what I like about you, Frank.  In a world where so many people 
try to take credit where it isn't really due, you go out of your way to 
make sure that the right person gets it.  If everyone in paranormal 
research had your lack of ego, we'd probably make a lot more progress.  
Just think of all the time people would save on chest thumping!
