I  have had the two \nFrank&#39;s box #&#39;S 12 and 29. #12 was stolen from me by a low  life that took \nadvantage of my generosity. That is another story.\nI still  have Frank&#39;s box #29, the reason you never hear files from me \nusing that box  is because it literally &quot;Sucks!&quot;\n\nMost if not all Frank&#39;s box is  inherently filled with static white noise \nand that combined with a metal echo  box and noise generator makes it very \ndifficult to hear anything let alone  communication which is difficult enough \nto hear from a quiet box likes the  125.\n\nFrank&#39;s box has seen it&#39;s day and served it&#39;s purpose in my  opinion it is \nantiquated and is no where near the quality of even a small  cheap RS 12-469 \nas far as clarity of communication.\n\nFrank is  actually using the guts from RS hacks to build his boxes now so \nwhy have a  &quot;FRANKENBOX&quot; that is essentially an RS hack with noise added \ninstead of just  buying an RS box and getting better communication?F\n\nMind you  this is only my opinion but it is based on years of experience \nwith every box  that is or has been used. I currently have 14 different boxes \nnot to mention  EVP maker and I have done extensive sessions and research \nwith each and for my  money you can give me a 20-125 every time, the Frank&#39;s \nbox should be retired  to the box museum where it belongs.\n\nI am the only person in this  research that will come out and speak the \ntruth about the Frank&#39;s box, there  are many people now that have them and the \nonly person you will ever hear a  file from is Steve Hula and sometimes \nFrank himself, and Frank&#39;s file is so  rough you may hear 1 out of a hundred \nfiles the way he does due to the fact  that he does not even take the time to \ndo a proper session he just turns the  box on and records a couple of minute \nusing his CELL PHONE  !\n\nFrank has his place in RTSC history due to his ALLEGED  invention off the \nfirst ghost box and he deserves the respect for his  &quot;POSSIBLE&quot; \naccomplishment but to be revered as a god in the box field NO not  by me anyway.\n\nI use the words &quot;ALLEGED&quot; and &quot;POSSIBLE&quot; in terms  of his being the first \nto create the ghost box due to some recent information  that has been brought \nto my attention that concerns an individual that  created, built and used A \nRadio Sweeping Ghost Box in 1969.\n\nI am  gathering information and documentation now and will hopefully be \nable to  dispel the myth of Frank assumption being the father of the ghost Box  \nsoon.\n\nThat is to be continued! \n \n \n \nAll is possible, nothing is probable\n \nBruce\n\n \n____________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**************An Excellent Credit Score is 750.
