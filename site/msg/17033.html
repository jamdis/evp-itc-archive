<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I suspect there are a lot of us who read and learn, but don&#x27;t feel like they have the technical knowledge to get into debate.  I also live in a small town and have dial-up, which makes sending sound files a nightmare.

&gt;  It&#x27;s done! I think this group has been over run by debunker/skeptics and any discussion has become impossible. They will tell everyone it&#x27;s just imagination, except in rare ocassions so they can maintain some credibilty. I don&#x27;t know where everyone else has gone, but they never comment. Guess the rest just want only ghost hunter related stuff, and igore all else.
