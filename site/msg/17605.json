One thing that bugs me\n&gt; &gt; about doing sessions is that you can never be sure whether the clear\n&gt; &gt; communications received are EVP or box related. It has been shown in studies\n&gt; &gt; that EVP&#39;s can be received in a vacuum so even recording a session with\n&gt; &gt; using the line out may capture EVP&#39;s (but probably is much less likely to do\n&gt; &gt; so).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This clip is from June 2009 at Rolling Hills Asylum. I am sure that this is\n&gt; &gt; an EVP because it my recorder was set up about 12 feet from the shack hack\n&gt; &gt; and it was the only recorder from that session to pick up this audio. This\n&gt; &gt; is a genuine Class A EVP, which is a rare thing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We were conducting a session and you can hear the cycle through ending and\n&gt; &gt; starting again. We were just about to end the session and had just called\n&gt; &gt; for any last minute communications when this clip occurred.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I use Google Chrome as a browser, so and it has problems with attachments.\n&gt; &gt; According to Chrome, the link is here:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Tim%20Woolworth/Misc/TW_RH_Xmas_I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; Here I&#39;m Here.mp3\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If that doesn&#39;t work, here is the folder (the only clip in it):\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Tim%20Woolworth/Misc/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tim\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, April\n&gt; &gt; Abercrombie &lt;april@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Listening to the box is certainly not like listening to an EVP and I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; personally disagree vehemently with the people out there who call box\n&gt; &gt; &gt; communications EVP&#39;s!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I totally agree.

A box session forces one to listen through\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noise as opposed to the silence.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Were these sessions recorded and listened back too or was an analysis\n&gt; &gt; made\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; strictly from real time? I do sessions all the time and I am lucky if I\n&gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pick up 35% of what comes through in real time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And finally, try not to be too dismayed. An EVP &#39;expert&#39; makes their\n&gt; &gt; bread\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and butter parading their EVP techniques. I witnessed one such expert\n&gt; &gt; who we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all have at least heard of create an EVP. How? The person in question\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scratched their thumb nail against the recorders mic to create a sound.\n&gt; &gt; This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person then played back the recorder to me and pitched it down to make\n&gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this person say what was heard sound more convincing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I made my money parading my EVP ability, I would discredit your box\n&gt; &gt; too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why? Because box users are the future of ITC and paranormal research.\n&gt; &gt; It is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relatively cheap, vastly available, and provides instant gratuity when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operating. Who wants to sit alone in the dark talking to silence when\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can hear the responses in real time? EVP is still a valid form of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication, but ghost boxes threaten an EVP experts way to make\n&gt; &gt; money.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Boxes are being used more and more, especially on the television shows\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public hunts. This hurts the revenue stream for EVP experts who used to\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the ones getting invited to guest star on hunts for a fee; they are now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being replaced by box users.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In short, box use can be discredited by every expert and skeptic in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field. It doesn&#39;t matter. Ghost box use now has its place in paranormal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; culture and it is not going to leave it anytime soon. Being situated in\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paranormal group that is lead by a para-celebrity has put me in the\n&gt; &gt; unique\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; position of visiting other groups and working with the other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; para-celebrities in this field quite frequently. I can assure you that\n&gt; &gt; ghost\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boxes aren&#39;t going anywhere because the majority of these people have\n&gt; &gt; at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least a shack hack in their paranormal arsenal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So let this expert discredit to his or her&#39;s hearts&#39; content. When they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; publish their results, the results become public and they are on the\n&gt; &gt; hook\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for what they say at that point (which could bite them in the ass one\n&gt; &gt; day).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Their results will not hurt the work that you are doing today Frank,\n&gt; &gt; nor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will what they say influence this forums core group in any way because\n&gt; &gt; we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know the boxes work.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tim\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;EVP-ITC%\n&gt; &gt; 40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Frank Sumption\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s probably not kosher to post this, but I find this highly\n&gt; &gt; insulting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all of us. As usual, igonore all facts and all other methods, such as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EVPmaker, which forms all the voices inside the computer. Ignore all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EVP messages, ignore all voices heard with no electronic aids. Ignore\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messages received via turned off TV and printers--and on and on, yet\n&gt; &gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know all about EVP..Ignore the fact that probably thousands use boxes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; successfully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We have conducted a few listening studies of reported radio-sweep\n&gt; &gt; EVP\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the results have not been good. We have also worked with a variety of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devices. Based on what we know about trans-etheric influences, how\n&gt; &gt; EVP\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; visual forms of ITC are formed and what we know about mediumship, it\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; difficult to fit radio-sweep into any established hypothesis. Without\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solid\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; research supporting it as producing EVP, it is impossible for us to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommend it or support its use. If there were double-blind studies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conducted by experienced researchers that shows it does produce\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phenomena,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we would gladly promote it as an alternative technique.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are pretty sure that, in transform EVP (ordinary recorder), the\n&gt; &gt; voice\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; formed in the electronics by transforming available audio-frequency\n&gt; &gt; noise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an active part of the electronics such as a transistor junction. We\n&gt; &gt; think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the process is amplification of a weak telekinetic signal via\n&gt; &gt; stochastic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resonance and we have found that the optimum audio-frequency signal\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a chaotic one rich in voice-frequencies with many transient\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perturbation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is our working hypothesis. &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can&#39;t say who this is from, cuz almost certain I&#39;d get sued.\n&gt; &gt; There&#39;s no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; double blind testing their BS either.
