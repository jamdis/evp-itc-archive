<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thank you kindly for giving me the opportunity to leave one more
comment before &quot;banning&quot; me. 
I have given some serious thought to this group over the last few
days. Contrary to popular opinion, I have never been attacking. I have
not name called, used profanity, etc. I have brought another opinion,
another thought, another suggestion. 
This group is called a &quot;discussion&quot; group. Discussions usually involve
more than one opinion. I did not know that I had joined a group of
&quot;gurus&quot; as you are so quick to call others mockingly. You do not want
any one&#x27;s opinion if it is different than your own. That&#x27;s fine, truly. 
You don&#x27;t have to ban me. I won&#x27;t come back again.

&gt;  I don&#x27;t have my group e-mail on, so can&#x27;t see posts and replies
from here , my apologies to the group, but--I&#x27;m such an ignorant
egoistic dumbass that I gave you the benefit of the doubt and allowed
you to say on the group despite the fact that most find you very
offensive. Despite your obvious uninformed, ignorant and mean spirited
attacks on other members character--still you were allowed to stay.
Say good-bye Babs!  Frank-S
