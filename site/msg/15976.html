    I remember in that video clip Misty posted a few weeks ago, there wa=
s a (German?) ghost box researcher guy who said that he was in contact with=
 his dead wife; she had told him that she didn't know exactly how she commu=
nicated with him, just that she thought about him and it happened. So I'm b=
etting there isn't a conscious process to make the box work.
