HOW do you tell if you&#39;re being ripped off if you are searching online to buy a box?  If you can point us in the right direction of where to purchase a &quot;frank&#39;s box&quot; would be deeply appreciated.\nWe saw that you can try and make your own but with my husband&#39;s work schedule and mine with 4 kids, sports etc.. the only time we get to work with EVP&#39;s and such is when we schedule an investigation and secure a babysitter! LOL Not to mention my husband isn&#39;t that technologically inclined. That is my job... and I would be afraid that I&#39;d have done something incorrectly and what we were experiencing really wasn&#39;t &quot;true&quot;.\nSorry to sound like such a newbie I&#39;m sure!\n\nThank you!
