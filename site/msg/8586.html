<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Misty,

yes, but as mentioned in the article, the soundwaves engraved in smoke
on paper were never intended to be played at that time. So it was
actually in best a preliminary stage to the phonograph. In most cases,
inventions don&#x27;t fall from the sky, and of course it seems very likely
that Edison had already heard of the &quot;phonautograph&quot; before he developed
his phonograph.

&gt; Yeah it makes one wonder. Then again this country not to mention the 
&gt; world as a whole has always been on the brink of new technology which 
&gt; they either cover up or covet to the point others rarely know of its 
&gt; existence. I wonder what else is laying around that was invented that 
&gt; nobody knows about or told others about. I found the smoke thing 
&gt; interesting tho. Never would have thought of that one so I was amazed 
&gt; that someone else did so long before edisons work became the 
&gt; forefront of technology. Considering the time frame it makes me 
&gt; ponder if he had heard of the work or just the idea even was enough 
&gt; to set his wheels turning and get him thinking in that direction.

&gt;&gt; Hi Misty,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; yeah, fascinating; however, I wonder why mechanical audio recording 
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; reproduction techniques haven&#x27;t been invented much earlier, since 
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; technical principle behind that is actually quite straightforward. I
&gt;&gt; could easily imagine that someone like Leonardo da Vinci could have
&gt;&gt; invented such a machine...
