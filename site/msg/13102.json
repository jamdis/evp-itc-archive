The key word being the CONTEXT of the message(s) recieved. Many of the data being recorded in ITC sessions is in DIRECT answer to the questions being posed. The same can be said of the EVP people are recording as well... Also, there are characteristics of the EVP that in my opinion set them apart from stray radio signals... one is the distinct monotone or &quot;other wordly&quot; sound of the EVP... also, many people record a popping sound seconds before the EVP is recorded...\n&gt;&gt; �\n&gt;&gt; As far as digital recorders go. I don&#39;t think anyone has conducted an independent study of which brands are more suseptible to radio interference than others. I think that would have less to do with make and brand and more to do with the the power of a particular 2-way radio...�\n&gt;&gt; �\n&gt;&gt; Louis\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- On Sun, 12/14/08, Rick &lt;rasterer@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From: Rick &lt;rasterer@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Of Radio Interference and equipment...\n&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt;&gt; Date: Sunday, December 14, 2008, 4:39 PM\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like an extremely important discovery, Laurie.\n&gt;&gt; If you have found that recorders are sensitive to some radio\n&gt;&gt; frequencies, and those recorders and those frequencies have not been\n&gt;&gt; well tested or documented, then potentially some recorders are also\n&gt;&gt; senstive to normal AM/FM, as well as other frequencies.
