This type of file sharing is new to me. I have a photo album site for shari=
ng and uploading photos, but you can't upload files. I didn't know there we=
re file sharing sites until joined this group, but I had always thought the=
re should be.

  LOL Snowfire! =
Nope it was not you this time. Others should read before they post because =
we just addressed this subject. Esnips is very easy to use it has two uploa=
ding options in case you cant use the java application use the single file =
uploader. Works alot like email upload attachments.

  If you need more hel=
p just holler and I am sure one of us will be more than willing to help you=
 figure it out. Posting from email as an attachment also works just not so =
well for the very large file sizes. There are many other file sharing stora=
ge places besides esnips. We just like the layout there and the ability to =
share with friends including sharing storage space.
