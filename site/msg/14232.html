Ok I am getting tired of having to say this especially twice in a couple da=
ys. Do not upload wav format files if you feel you must share it in wav for=
mat then use esnips or another file sharing source. If newbies cant follow =
the groups rules then you will not be allowed to upload files period.

=
Everything will be deleted and you may reupload in proper formats and remem=
ber to respect the fact that this group of over 500 people has a limited am=
oyunt of file sharing space on yahoo. Only 100 megs split between everyone.=
 that is why we work to get around our limitations by attaching files to po=
sts via email attachment or using http://www.esnips.com etcetera.
