It seems to be a normal function of our own minds(living or\ndead), the same as reverse speech. I found some faces in old EVPs from boxes\nand also in music files. The ones from Evanescence are pretty impressive in\nperson, and do not seem to be intentionaly embedded.\n\n I know, it&#39;s not ghost hunters, and most don&#39;t want to have to think.\nI think most want this stuff in a neat little box, all well defined, all\nrules and protocols known, but it just won&#39;t stay in one box, or universe\nfor that matter.\n\n Frank-S\n\nI'm hinking he e is aces embedded in sound, i 's ela ed o speech, and no jus EVP.
