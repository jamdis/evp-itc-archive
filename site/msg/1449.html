What questions do you ask now?

------------------------------------

Here are some I like to ask:

Is it OK if I record your voice?

Is it OK if I take your picture?

What is your name?

Do you know where you are?

Do you know what year it is?

When were you born?

Where were you born?

When did you die?

What was your cause of death?

Do you enjoy being here?

Are there others here with you?

Do you want (me) (us) to leave?

Is it OK if we stay?

Do you enjoy having visitors?

Does any of your family ever visit you?

Is it OK if we come back again?

Do you like sports? (Baseball?) (Football?) etc.

Did you have any hobbies?

What do you miss the most?

-------------------------------

I&#x27;ve gotten some interesting responses.  Last year I asked &quot;Do you know 
what year it is?&quot; and a woman&#x27;s voice plainly said &quot;1996&quot;. On one 
investigation I asked &quot;Do you want us to leave?&quot; and a male voice said 
&quot;You just got here.&quot; At another site someone asked &quot;What was your cause 
of death?&quot; and I heard &quot;poisoning&quot;.

It&#x27;s funny when the ghosts join in on your conversations even though 
you&#x27;re not asking questions.  Some of them are very playful.

I was on one investigation a couple years ago when someone asked &quot;Do you 
know the Cubs are in the World Series this year?&quot;  :-)

If you are at the location of a tombstone you can ask if the person is 
(name on tombstone) or knows (name on tombstone).

I hope those help a little bit.

Zack
