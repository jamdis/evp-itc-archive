&gt; Someone came into work today and gave me 8 free passes for
&gt; something called
&gt; a slingshot ride here in central fl so when I got home I
&gt; thought I would
&gt; look it up to see what I will NOT be doing. I ran across
&gt; this one and its
&gt; funny and terrifying!!! So of course I had to share it with
&gt; you guys LOL I
&gt; dont think they use that kind of harness here its more like
&gt; roller coaster
&gt; ride style lockdown.
