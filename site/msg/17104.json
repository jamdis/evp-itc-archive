The tuner is just as it came out, nothing added. I usually add an exteranl antenna winding on the ferrite after I get he sweep working. Most of these tuners sound ok like this, but when swept they get more noisy. This model has a metal shield under the tuner, so I&#39;m leaving that intact. \n\n I&#39;m not like an engineer or anything, and I have a hard time with maht, electronics is all math. Most of the circuits I use are straight out of the data sheets for the chips, or found on the web, like at Elliot sound http://sound.westhost.com/   Alot of it is intuition, just kinda know how to make it work, somehow. \n\n I get most of the tuners/radios at thrift stores, and it&#39;s a crap shoot to get good ones. \n\n F-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Chris Salois &lt;chrissalois@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; That sounds even better on am. That&#39;s pretty easy on the ears. Sounds like straight communication there. There seems to be something at the end as well, just can&#39;t seem to make it out. I can&#39;t beleive that radio comes out of a Timex alarm clock, ....amazing. I know next to nothing about electronics overall, i just kind of limp along with it. I wasnt expecting the audio to sound so clean with that radio. Did you add another antenna other than the small one on the board itself? Might be time to hit some yard sales. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Chris\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Thu, May 6, 2010 11:23:41 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Next.

Another video, AM manual sweep, at 3 seconds &quot;Princess-I come Friday--That&#39;s the date&quot;. All one needs is an easily tuned radio, manual works as good as anything else. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, May 6, 2010 at 9:15 AM, Chris Salois &lt;chrissalois@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; &gt;Sounds good Frank. Nice job and thanks for posting. The video clips are a great bonus.

[2 Attachments]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I have a frikkin&#39; obsession with this junk! I want to try mixing the white noise with the tuner audio, being able to disable the funcion via a panel switch. That is, given enough time! I always get these crackhead ETs, or what claims to be them giving these pick up dates. May 7th is another one of these. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This the tuner from a Timex T309T Clock Radio. Even in this, at one second &quot;girl-it&#39;s done...&quot;, and don&#39;t think for a nono second that I don&#39;t still feel embarrased at posting voices that call me a girl, even after all these years. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; F-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
