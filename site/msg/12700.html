<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Interesting Mike. Frank spoke about making a copper box because they mentioned it. I kept saying reminds me of a faraday cage. Also interesting when you shut the door and its on AM at 1:54 in the video I hear &quot;Your ghostbox box&quot;. I hear a little more after that but thats what I hear clearest LOL

A box for your box. LOL at least you didnt press the on button.

&gt; While reading a book about spirit communication, there was a
&gt; chapter 
&gt; which referenced the Faraday Cage.  So... after reading it
&gt; I decided to 
&gt; try out what the book suggested and placed my Radio Shack
&gt; Hack 12-470 
&gt; Ghost Box into my microwave oven (in the OFF position) and
&gt; ran a sweep 
&gt; in the AM and FM mode.
&gt; The AM mode did receive much less but a few audio snippets
&gt; did make 
&gt; their way through.  The FM mode was a different story. No
&gt; frequencies 
&gt; at all made it through... just white noise as each FM
&gt; frequency was 
&gt; reached during the sweep.
&gt; As I always do... I made a short video of both modes being
&gt; sweeped.
&gt; You can see it, here:
