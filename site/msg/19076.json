The story I got from th=\r\ne seller is:\n\n&quot;I got possession of it at an investigation in PA, but it was=\r\n originally from \nNH. I did not use it because it is a lot bigger than the =\r\n469 and I fly to \ninvestigations. It has been unused and what I was told is=\r\n that it was modified \nto sweep.&quot;\n=A0\nI&#39;m attaching a photo of the signatur=\r\ne that appears on the front=A0of the radio. \nDoes anyone have any clue at a=\r\nll to who may have done the modifications?
