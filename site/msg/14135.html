<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello Frank 
hobbyists like yourself using readily available technology  to support a form of 2 way radio communication - with the &quot;spirit&quot; realm, is a major acheivement, and the only shortfall in my opinion (and it is not a technical flaw) is the need to filter out the noise aspect.

I would surrgest the output from these &quot;stage one devices&quot; needs to become the input for another device which will filter/capture those wave forms - &quot;tagged&quot; in some manner as being actual responses, and this I feel can (will) be acheived through some clever computer software development so that communications will eventualy flow through a four stage process (4th stage = filtering) 
1. human operator
2.spirit entity
3.Ghost box
4.filtering software.

I am convinced products such as voice recognition programs, can be &quot;tweaked&quot;  to provide these filtering capabilitys.so is anyone up for the challenge or knows anyone who could work their magic re: a software guru with a paranormal interest ?;)
all the best, 
D

&gt; &gt; hello,
&gt; &gt; does anyone know of a system which can fix a voice wave form out of the
&gt; &gt; background noise e.g a ghost box combined with voice recogntion software so
&gt; &gt; that EVP responses are automatically registered (on the screen) so that even
&gt; &gt; if consiously the operator may miss audio responses due to the background
&gt; &gt; noise the machine/PC audio sensitivity will not ?
&gt; &gt;
