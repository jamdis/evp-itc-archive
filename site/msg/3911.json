In \nfact, it was a little easier for me to hear these than the Frank&#39;s box 12 files.  At one point, \nyou asked if they could use fm too and got a yes and I swear I also heard a thank you \nlayered almost under it--maybe my imagination though.  The british ace one was clear as \na bell. \nI have to say that it is tremendous to hear you having what are real-time (or our time, \nmaybe) conversations on these.  Its so cool!  It just struck me strongly today while listening \nto this batch for some reason.\n\nJulie\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bhali333&quot; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Come on guy&#39;s a little feedback!\n&gt; \n&gt; I posted 16 files two day&#39;s ago from the RSbox and only got 2 replies \n&gt; and both were from ann.\n&gt; \n&gt; I posted a bunch of frank&#39;s box files today and not one response.\n&gt; \n&gt; lets jump start this group with some new and positive energy everybody \n&gt; do some sessions and post the results, lets start the advance into the \n&gt; future.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;"}
