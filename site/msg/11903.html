Actually, I went to the Old Roswell Cemetery. Which one are you talking about? I'd love to go.

Chad,
If you went to the cemetary with H.Analyst, I probably know 
which one you went to.
There are some not so nice things that happen at that 
cemetary.... .

I haven't experienced the EVP/ITC, but many cemeteries have guardians 
that 
try to ward you off in various ways. From my experience, if they 
finally 
decide you're not there to do harm they will kind of back off and 
leave 
you alone.

A simple thing like straightening a skewed tombstone 
or cleaning up a mess 
will convince them you're not there to harm. Also, 
tell them that you're 
not there to do damage.
