Rod,

I have seen these wo=

ery one of them changed there tune when they made contact (real contact). C=
iting that they didn't know it was possible. In your words you are a ghost =
hunter and not an expert (even though you give your GH resume wanting us al=
l to believe so). Ghost hunter thrive on proof! They almost worship the wor=
ds proof and evidence. The fact is that many of us; Sumption, Bruce, Misty,=
 Steve, myself and many others have presented proof on a daily basis using =
a myriad of different methods to obtain it. The quote I have placed above, =
taken from your own post are just words. 

Open your mind a bit. As was sai=
d earlier you will experience what you expect to experience.
