I don't think I =
have enough data yet  to make any conclusions, so I plan 
more  experiments=
.  Since there are different  distinct claims about what the 
box or the re=
corders  can do, I try to make different distinct experiments  
for each.

=
Some people claim they can get the  box to tell them things that the 
opera=
tor couldn't  know, so my "whats the object" experiment is one way  to 
exa=
mine that.  Some people claim the boxes  can make predictions, so catalogin=
g 
predictions and  examining the results can help examine that.   If there=
 are 
other claims, I will try to figure  experiments based on those.
