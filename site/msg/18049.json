I  admire your courage and \nmotivation to try different  methods, see wh=\r\nat works, and try to improve \neveryone&#39;s  understanding of EVP-ITC.\n\nIf you=\r\n recall, on  7/10/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer  \nmonitor, =\r\nright in front of me, and left it there until  today, 7/14/2010, noon \nDenv=\r\ner time. The experiment was for  participants to determine what it was. \nVa=\r\ngue or partial  answers wouldn&#39;t be counted (for example, just colors,  \nsh=\r\napes, sizes, what it&#39;s made of, etc): we&#39;re looking for  what it is. \nParti=\r\ncipants could use their ghost boxes, EVP  recorders, or I suppose any other=\r\n \nmeans they  chose.\n\nIn order to keep me honest, I took a picture  of the =\r\nobject at the start of \nthe experiment and loaded it  to the Files section =\r\n(RJ folder) of this \ngroup. If you can  follow the link, it is here:\n\n_http=\r\n://tech. groups.yahoo.  com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710.  \n1.zip_ =\r\n(http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip) \n\nT=\r\nhe idea was that you could download the  file at the beginning of the \ntest=\r\n, and &#39;keep it safe&#39; on  your computer. Then at the end of the test, I woul=\r\nd \n release the password so you could reveal the contents of  the file. Tha=\r\nt \nway, you were in control of the original  image during the entire test, =\r\nnot \nme. \n\nThe password  for that file is: 123BlastOff\nInstructions, if you=\r\n need  them, are also in that RJ folder.\n\nAnd if you did  not care to downl=\r\noad the zip file before the test, I will  \npost the final image there too.\n=\r\n\nSo to the  results:\n\nNumber of participants: 5\nTotal tries:  8\nAmbiguous a=\r\nnswers: 0\nCorrect answers:  0\n\nObject: A radio\nUzipped picture:\n_http://tec=\r\nh. groups.yahoo.  com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710.  \n1.JPG_ (http:=\r\n//tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG) \n\nSo what=\r\n do the results mean? All that we  can really agree on from this \nexperimen=\r\nt is that no  participant, with whatever theories or methods or  \ntechnolog=\r\ny they used, was able to correctly determine the  object. We can&#39;t say \ntho=\r\nse theories or methods or  technologies never work. Just as we can&#39;t say \nt=\r\nhey do.  Just that, for whatever reason, they did not work this  time. \nRea=\r\nders can take the results, use them to improve or  change their methods, or=\r\n \nkeep doing what they&#39;re  doing.\n\nIf anyone has any observations, comments=\r\n, or  ideas for improvement, let me \nknow.

If you can \n                      follow the link, it is here:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nA                         title=3Dhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-IT=\r\nC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip                         href=3D&quot;http://tech.gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip&quot;                   =\r\n      rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://tech. groups.yahoo. \n          =\r\n            com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710. \n                    =\r\n  1.zip&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The idea was that you could download the \n              =\r\n        file at the beginning of the test, and &#39;keep it safe&#39; on \n         =\r\n             your computer. Then at the end of the test, I would \n         =\r\n             release the password so you could reveal the contents of \n    =\r\n                  the file. That way, you were in control of the original \n=\r\n                      image during the entire test, not me. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The pas=\r\nsword \n                      for that file is: 123BlastOff&lt;BR&gt;Instructions,=\r\n if you need \n                      them, are also in that RJ folder.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;And if you did \n                      not care to download the zip file b=\r\nefore the test, I will \n                      post the final image there to=\r\no.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So to the \n                      results:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Number of partic=\r\nipants: 5&lt;BR&gt;Total tries: \n                      8&lt;BR&gt;Ambiguous answers: 0&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Correct answers: \n                      0&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Object: A radio&lt;BR&gt;Uzip=\r\nped picture:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A                         title=3Dhttp://tech.groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG                         href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.JPG&quot; =\r\n                        rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://tech. groups.=\r\nyahoo. \n                      com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710. \n  =\r\n                    1.JPG&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So what do the results mean? All that =\r\nwe \n                      can really agree on from this experiment is that =\r\nno \n                      participant, with whatever theories or methods or=\r\n \n                      technology they used, was able to correctly determi=\r\nne the \n                      object. We can&#39;t say those theories or method=\r\ns or \n                      technologies never work. Just as we can&#39;t say t=\r\nhey do. \n                      Just that, for whatever reason, they did not=\r\n work this \n                      time. Readers can take the results, use t=\r\nhem to improve or \n                      change their methods, or keep doin=\r\ng what they&#39;re \n                      doing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If anyone has any obser=\r\nvations, comments, or \n                      ideas for improvement, let me =\r\nknow. I hope to get a new \n                      experiment up and running =\r\nsoon. Since there wasn&#39;t much \n                      participation Mon-Wed,=\r\n I think the next experiment will be \n                      arranged to mos=\r\ntly span the weekends.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Again, thanks \n                      to every=\r\none who participated in this first \n                      experiment.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                      &lt;DIV                         style=3D&quot;HE=\r\nIGHT: 0px; COLOR: rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n\n                    &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n                    &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCK=\r\nQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT          =\r\n     color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT               style=3D&quot;BAC=\r\nKGROUND-COLOR: transparent&quot; color=3D#000000 size=3D2               face=3DA=\r\nrial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n            &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;HEIGHT: 0px; COLOR: rgb(255,2=\r\n55,255)&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT               color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT               style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent&quot; color=3D#000000 s=\r\nize=3D2               face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT c=\r\nolor=3D#000000 size=3D2             face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCK=\r\nQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;HEIGHT: 0px;=\r\n COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n--part1_75614.2c813fe4.396f8b24_boundary--"}
