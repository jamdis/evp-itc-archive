I agree that it&#39;s a matter of personal\npreference, and I think researchers need to experiment to find their\nown optimum comfort/performance levels.  What works for some will not\nfor others.  \n\nPersonally, I find that an overall, daily approach of\nprayer/meditation concerning all of my personal and professional\nendeavors is the most effective for me.  I don&#39;t do it to keep things\nout, but to try to stay oriented on the most positive track.  Words,\nthoughts and objects have all been demonstrated universally to be\ntools of spiritual power.  Why not use them if it feels appropriate?\n\nOne of the best things we can do is share &quot;here&#39;s what works for me&quot;\nand let others try it to see for themselves.\n\nThanks, everyone,\nRosemary"}
