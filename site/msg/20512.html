Question:

I don't hear most of the files you po=
st, but you hear them so clearly. The only way to validate what you hear is=
 true, would be to follow up with something that you got that actually happ=
ened.

Have you ever heard a message that came true that nobody else heard,=
 basically validating your experience?
