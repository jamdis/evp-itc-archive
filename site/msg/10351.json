I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s real or not...I remember \n&gt; no one was talking around me at the time...could it have been some \n&gt; random fabric sound?\n&gt; \n&gt; If it is real, how likely for someone on the other side to be on an \n&gt; air plane, and what kind of help would they need?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Rob\n&gt;"}
