A trip to the ve=
t will answer that question, usually most breaks can be set unless there is=
 another underlying problem. It is a cute lil dog, sometimes they are very =
fragile bone structures because of breeding. There are a few small dogs tha=
t seem to have alot of problems with bad backs and breaking legs/feet. 

 
=

I think its proof to those who want it, and as for me...nobody is talking =
about me on the radio, or using my full name...so it definitely gets my att=
ention when my name is being used in context with things that are going on =
around me or happening to people I know.

 

I dont need any proof, they ju=
st give it freely so I can share or in some cases not share with everyone.
=

 

I stopped lookin for proof right about the time this all started. My fi=
rst evp was all that I needed to get me on this path. My mothers voice, so =
long after shes been passed, friends, relatives, or even perfect strangers =
who I had no clue about until I found out after the fact....way too many pr=
oofs have been freely given to me, and I never asked for one. Earl and Bob =
Cox, I think thats one of my favorite WOW moments, not knowing about Erland=
 Babcock it was an easy misunderstanding. Luckily I make everything phoneti=
c so it was easy to catch later. I have listened to others evp from him sin=
ce then and I often STILL hear earl and bob cox. They have also given me na=
mes of workers on this side who I have bumped into later tho I usually put =
off contacting anyone they mention until I think the time is right. Usually=
 it is just weird to find out its a REAL LIVE person and that they just hap=
pen to be in the EVP/ITC field. 

 

I used to always assume when they say =
a name they are talking about spirits there. Or that if I get an ITC image =
its a spirit face. They proved thats a wrong assumption on several occasion=
s. Probably the only time I ever asked for anything was while doing an itc =
session, after so many faces I just wanted them to show me something else, =
anything else, "show me something different" led to a few portraits of the =
living.

 

Sometimes they speak the truth, sometimes a wayward thought cre=
eps threw that shouldnt (or just a creep)... as for the dog...take it to th=
e vet and see what they can do then you will know more.
