I thought the &#39;talk therapy&#39; remark was \nvery funny as well.  There was nothing removed between that statement and my having \nasked if anybody was there.  The response was immediate.  Very cool.\n\nI like various EVP techniques .... recording in silence, or using various backgrounds, and \nI&#39;m a big fan of manual radio sweep.  I also have had positive results with the Radio Shack \nhacks, and I&#39;m having a good time with my MiniBox.  So, now I have added EVP Maker to \nmy list.  Fabulous!  :-)\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Margaret,\n&gt; \n&gt; yes, you done it right - congrats! :) I can hear it almost like you;\n&gt; only the last two parts sound different to me. Instead of &quot;How can I do\n&gt; you for?&quot;, I hear &quot;How am I to you? (or)&quot;. The last part is\n&gt; unintelligible for my (non-english) ears. The best part is definitely\n&gt; the phrase &quot;I&#39;m at the talk therapy group.&quot; Obviously the `guys do have\n&gt; a sense of humor...\n&gt; \n&gt; Stefan\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks so much for the SJ Allophones files, Stefan!\n&gt; &gt; I got an amazing response - well, amazing to me, anyway ;0) - right off the bat.  \n&gt; &gt; Just posted my first file ever to the forum. Hope I&#39;ve done it correctly.  Margaret\n&gt;"}
