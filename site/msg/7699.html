<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all,

I&#x27;m currently thinking about a new kind of &quot;spirit speaking machine&quot;. The idea is to build a kind of &quot;instrument&quot; for spirits to play on if they want to speak to us. Actually this has been the basic idea when I began to develop programs like Audio-Ed, Audigit, or EVPmaker. Phoneme synthesis was the easiest way to implement this, but actually I do think that formant synthesis is probably more appropriate for this purpose, since it does simulate the human vocal tract and thus is more &quot;natural&quot;. Perhaps this a more &quot;intuitive&quot; way for spirits to produce voices than by assembling sound fragments.

There have been attempts to build mechanical &quot;speaking machines&quot; already in the 18th century. These machines used a bellows, a whistle, a resonance box, a rubber funnel, etc., to simulate lungs, vocal cords, vocal tract and a mouth. A person could let the machine speak in different languages by moving levers and opening or closing the &quot;mouth&quot;. See also: http://www.ling.su.se/staff/hartmut/kemplne.htm

Today we can use electronic components or software to simulate the human vocal tract by generators and filters. Only a few parameters (generator and filter frequencies) have to be altered to let such a system &quot;speak&quot;. A program to demonstrate the generation of vowels by formant synthesis can be downloaded here: http://www.speech.kth.se/wavesurfer/formant/

I think it shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to build an electronic &quot;speaking machine&quot;. The main question is: Will the spirits be able to operate such a machine? What kind of &quot;levers&quot; do we have to provide for them? The easiest way would of course be random voltage generators (RVG) to vary the parameters; to generate speech, the spirits would have to try to influence these RVGs. However, I doubt that this would be the best way since it would result in a lot of random noises. Perhaps we should provide actual sensors for the assumed &quot;spirit energy&quot;, e.g. EMF detectors, electrostatic fields, etc. Or maybe light?
