Enjoy! and keep us in the loop.\n&gt; Deb\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 1/24/2010 6:31 PM, Jill wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think you have a reasonable theory, and I like it. Except what I was \n&gt; &gt; referring to was the way using the box makes you suddenly more able to \n&gt; &gt; have psychic abilities, e.g. having more dreams that are &quot;visitations&quot; \n&gt; &gt; from the dead, or being more able to know right before your best \n&gt; &gt; friend is going to phone you, stuff like that. Psychic abilities. Why \n&gt; &gt; should using the box make stuff like that happen more easily? Because \n&gt; &gt; it does, and it&#39;s weird!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\ni think we are all psychic but we do not use our abilities because we are all caught up with the physical world and and our other daily lives, the box helps us focus our psychic abilities and produces results. the box is just a tool for psychic development i think."}
