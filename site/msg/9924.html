Stefan Bion <yahoogroups@...> wrote:          Hi all,

just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I would
suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, in
order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can for
instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (including
the experimenter's voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, but
not cut out individual pieces (supposed "garbage") to make an EVP match
with what it "should be". At least, the unedited version should always
be provided along with the edited version.

But that's only my personal opinion which I thought I had to express, as
we should always be able to present our results to a critical public.
