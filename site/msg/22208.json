I&#39;ve only seen block diagrams for it.  Can you describe your set up?\n\nI always wanted to try the spiricom.  A couple years ago i did a test with my wireless guitar transmitter, tape noise, spiricom tones and to make it different i used box sweep.  Got interesting results, but i&#39;d like to hear how you went about the experiment.\n\nHere is a few videos i made doing the experimenting:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSCg23jkOC0\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/urkel23#p/u/61/IKVz2iQxLqU\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/urkel23#p/u/60/fU5ekSpSusc\n\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mikemay@...&quot; &lt;mikemay@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; yes , nothing but annoying buzzing tone so far :(\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Peter James Haviland ACCH &lt;docstrangeone@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Has anyone tried to build and use the spiricom device?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Pete\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
