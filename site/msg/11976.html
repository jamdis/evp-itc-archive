&gt; Im bacccccccck!
&gt;  
&gt; Sorry had dead modem and had to wait for cable company to
&gt; bring out a new one, took em 3 weeks!
&gt;  
&gt; So I did a some sessions while I waited, got some good
&gt; responses and actually a few EVPs saying my name and that
&gt; mom loves you....checked my mail when I got my net back and
&gt; got an email from the lady(Pat) that lived next door to my
&gt; mom and whom was a good friend of my mom.  Theres a new
&gt; family living on my moms property now, new mobile home and
&gt; all...well they have a 3 year old son who talked to my moms
&gt; friend a week or so ago...the little boy was telling her
&gt; about talking to a &quot;man with ugly eyes&quot; in his
&gt; room and how he was nice, he wasnt mean, Pat thinks(and I
&gt; tend to agree) that the boy was talking to my mom...my mom
&gt; had realllllly short hair and didnt have pretty eyes, she
&gt; had almost manly features as she got older and it would be
&gt; easy for a 3 year old to think she was male, specially at
&gt; night in a semi dark room.  The boy didnt say what they
&gt; talked about, but they had a conversation and he wasnt
&gt; scared...this happened on the day I got the EVPs in
&gt;  my session.  I wanna get a digi recorder now and see if
&gt; they would allow me to do a session at their place...would
&gt; be very interesting to see what kind of responses Id get if
&gt; I were on her property compared to sitting in my place which
&gt; is 20 miles or so away.
&gt;  
&gt; Anyways, just wanted to share that with ya&#x27;ll.  Hope
&gt; everyone is having a good week so far!  
&gt;
