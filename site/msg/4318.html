<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ahhh.. you&#x27;re right!  My bad...  I looked closer at the picture and 
then compared it to my older 12-470.  I do see differences... no 
speaker and the label at the bottom of the radio is different from my 
12-470.
I have never seen an older 12-469... until now.
Thanks, LC...

&gt; Mike, it looks like the older version 12-469, as there is no 
external 
&gt; speaker, IMHO. ;)

&gt; &gt; There is also someone in Colorado offering a 12-469 (ebay item # 
&gt; &gt; 160191131148) for $14.95 plus shipping.  The ad picture is of the 
&gt; older 
&gt; &gt; model 12-470 though, not the 12-469.  I know the Radio Shack 
&gt; website 
&gt; &gt; has the same mistake; they have the two pictures mixed up. Their 
12-
&gt; 469 
&gt; &gt; page has a picture of the older 12-470 and their 12-470 page has 
a 
&gt; &gt; picture of th 12-469.
&gt; &gt; That is probably where this person got the picture from, thinking 
&gt; it is 
&gt; &gt; correct.  If that in fact was a real &quot;older 12-470&quot; he was 
selling, 
&gt; &gt; $14.95 would be a great price since it is very hard to find any 
&gt; olde 12-
&gt; &gt; 470 in the stores anymore.  Remember, only the older 12-470 can 
be 
&gt; &gt; hacked, no newer 12-470 (all black case) has been hacked yet.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If someone were interested I would contact the guy and ask him to 
&gt; take 
&gt; &gt; a picture of the box. Then you would know exactly which radio he 
&gt; has on 
&gt; &gt; ebay for sale.
