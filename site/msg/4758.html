<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bruce,

Yes, that&#x27;s going to be my next project. We did have a Shack Hack with  
us when I got that evp, but it was cycling thru the stations too  
slowly and the person who brought it said she was going to fix that.  
I&#x27;ve heard I can get a chip from UFO Geek for that purpose. None of  
that makes any sense to me yet, I&#x27;m new to electronics but am a real  
DIY person so I guess I&#x27;ll learn! This forum introduced me to the  
concept of ritual evp recording, which would be a great opportunity  
for me to experiment with the box and also train my ears to separate  
the real communication from matrixing.

Thanks for the offer of help, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll need it when I get to that  
point!

&gt; Hey Deb,
&gt;
&gt; What I think you should be experimenting with a radio shack hack.
&gt; you can pick up a 12-469 at radio shack for 24.99 and you will be able
&gt; to start doing box research as opposed to traditional evp . you will  
&gt; be able
&gt; to enter a new world of real time communication. And don&#x27;t worry I  
&gt; will be here to help get you going.

&gt; Okay, I figured out what I was doing wrong. I&#x27;m just learning how to  
&gt; use Audacity, I was using &quot;Invert&quot; instead of &quot;Reverse.&quot; My bad!

&gt; Steve, holy cow, you&#x27;re right, it says Margaret! That is interesting  
&gt; that you didn&#x27;t hear anything in my second clip. I had reversed my  
&gt; clip previously, but didn&#x27;t sounds like anything but backwards  
&gt; words. How did you do that?

&gt; I hear nothing in the 2nd file, but i raised the volume of the first

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m attaching an EVP that I picked up last week. We could hear it in
&gt; person at the time, and it sounded like &quot;get out.&quot; Once I pulled it
&gt; into Audacity, it sounded completely different. Slowing it down 33%
&gt; makes it sound even more different. Any guesses? I haven&#x27;t done
&gt; anything to these files other than to slow the second version down a
&gt; bit. Deb T
