Your points a=
re well taken John.  And I  agree it is a first attempt and

For this first experiment/protocol , I  thought we would go as =
generic as 
possible: it doesn't matter  really here where the information =
comes from, or 
how different  people interpret it: just determine the obje=
ct in the 
specific  timeframe.  We'll start with data on how accurate the =
 participants can 
get, however they do it.

As to your  comment on the aud=
io files:  originally I considered  requiring 
as part of the protocol to i=
nclude the audio.   Maybe that is still a good 
idea.  The reason I didn't,=
 is  because people often claim to hear different 
things each time  they l=
isten to a file.  Posting a file with an incorrect  
answer, for example, t=
he person may later claim (after the  experiment) to 
NOW hear the right an=
swer.  And others may  confirm it.

This seemed liked a rabbit hole, and I'=
m  not sure how to handle it. So for 
this trial, I figured we'd  just not =
go there, and require replies only be 
valid if they  are given during the =
experiments specified time frame. Once  
the actual object is know, it seem=
s too easy for a person to  come up with 
the answer.

But yeah, we need to=
 see how  this goes, fix the problems, and come up with 
more of  them!

=
 
 
Since we're talking about experiments and protocols  here are some idea=
s to 
improve
the protocol RJ suggested initially. Using a test  target is =
one way of 
establishing a 
truth in time, which is the basis of this exper=
iment.  But there are a 
couple of issues.
 
It is quite possible that some=
one could discern the  target through remote 
viewing alone.
This would neg=
ate the need for involvement of a spirit  communicator or 
discarnate entit=
y.
Outcomes depend on the word of those reporting.  The true skeptic (not 
=
cynic) would 
therefore say that this experiment contains a basic  flaw in =
that it does 
not uniquely 
indicate that the information was obtained in t=
he  prescribed manner. 
Providing access
to the raw audio file would not ne=
cessarily constitute  proof either, since 
many of these 
communications ca=
n only be heard by certain people,  

If the audio file were quite clear,  =
timing  becomes an issue. In other 
words, when was  
the audio actually re=
corded?  This issue can be  mitigated simply by 
requiring any
claimant to =
email the audio file to a trusted party  before the test ends. 
It would be=
 best 
if the trusted party were not otherwise involved in the  experiment =
and it 
was  their duty 
simply to collect the claims. Once all claims had =
 been collected they 
could be posted 
publicly for review by the community=
 in  general.  The experimenter could 
decide if any 
of the claims seemed =
to have hit, and this  decision could be reviewed by 
anyone if desired. 
 =

The important detail however is that this experiment  does not completely =

answer the 
question. It is a first attempt and certainly can be  improved=
 on 
successive trials.
 
Successive trials are always a good idea, since i=
t  provides replication. 
And it would be

best if others replicated the ex=
periment using a very  similar protocol. If 
these were to
succeed, the com=
munity could then state that out of X  trials Y had 
succeeded (by 
some de=
finition of success) potentially giving a  success rate above that 
expecte=
d 
by random chance. This would make the outcome  quantifiable and measurea=
ble 
and thus meaningful.
 
But also important to note, this would only pro=
ve the  potential veracity 
of the messages.
It would not (and cannot as fa=
r as I can tell) prove  the origin of the 
messages. This detail
will, I fe=
ar, remain a matter for belief and  speculation for quite some 
time to com=
e.
