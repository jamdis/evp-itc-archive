I have \ndone \n&gt; about 5 sessions with it and can say, in my opinion it rivals any \nbox \n&gt; and even surpasses a couple.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am working on the last recording now, and it is the best yet!\n&gt; These files are from the last recording. \n&gt; \n&gt; This method seems to just get better with every session. I think \nthe \n&gt; tech powers that be should start working on development along this \nline.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have done alot of real time communication research and this \nmethod is \n&gt; one of the best so far.\n&gt; \n&gt; bruce\n&gt;"}
