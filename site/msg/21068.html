<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>No, you have to wrap the box in cast iron sheets, then a layer of charged copper, then sink it under 100 feet of salt water so no RF gets in. 
 Orrrr, just leave to box turned off, since the purpose is to defeat it&#x27;s function. 
 I don&#x27;t know who came with the idea of shielding he boxes, but it&#x27;s f--- stupid. The purpose of the box is to get bits of speech, music and noise, call raw audio, that the entities use ot make their voices out of. Some do not want this process to work. so they come out with these idiotic ways to defeat the box, and it works, since most in America have zero technical knowledge. Covering the box with fol is a scam, a con, a trick, and fucking dumbass idea. 

 If ya want white noise voices, why even have the box!?

 but some expert said it, so it must be true, to hell with what I have to say!

&gt; They could have had it on AM regular mode, not AM wide.  AM wide pulls in a lot of radio, but AM regular mode only pulls in a few.  Also, i think i heard somebody say they were wrapping it in tin foil to make a faraday cage.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Not sure about that, because you can&#x27;t see it in the video.

&gt; &gt; I wonder why her radio doesn&#x27;t seem to have any static it&#x27;s like they say a 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  word or two, then it&#x27;s silent and then another word, i wonder if she is 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; using it  in FM or AM, on the RS 12-125, yes, I have one of those, it&#x27;s my 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; best of the  radio&#x27;s, i like it because i can change the bass treble, and it 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; doesn&#x27;t have as  much static, but it&#x27;s no where as clear as hers.  sf

&gt; &gt; It says in the comments below, that they were using a 12-150 shack  hack. I 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; believe you already have one of those radios.
