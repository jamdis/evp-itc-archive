I have my New (to me) Sony TCM-5000 strapped to my bike seat (not turned on). I am asking if they can &quot;maybe do something with the circuits....or CHARGE it up&quot; As I listen I hear (low audio) wump-wump-wump (loud ringing sound) then (low audio) wuuump-wuuump. Maybe they DID or WILL do something :) \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Jim%27s%20RR-DR60%20EVP%27s/charge%20up%20my%20Sony.mp3 \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles\n\nRegards,\n\nclockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt;"}
