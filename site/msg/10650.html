<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>LOL Rees.  You talking about your Mama reminds of my father and grandmother.  On my 
dad&#x27;s 65th birthday, my grandma said, &quot;You may be 65, but you&#x27;ll always be my little boy.&quot;  
:-)  

I think anyone, at any age, can appreciate having a parent in their corner if they are lucky 
enough to have that kind of relationship.  I feel very fortunate indeed that both of my 
parents support my research (though it took my mom a lonnnng time to come around to it 
---- she kept saying, &quot;You can&#x27;t talk about things like this.  Someone is going to come 
and take you away).

&gt; Hey guys
&gt;    
&gt;   I also have some skeptics in my research.  A  co worker that works with me in the tech 
support dept. , and he doesn&#x27;t  believe me either.  I will play some files for him, and some 
of them he can hear, but most he doesn&#x27;t.  My girl sometimes wants me to show some 
friends a box session and I don&#x27;t like doing session with anybody else,  because they don&#x27;t 
understand what we are doing this for, and they and think its all radio fragment anyway.  
Which some are, but me and her can tell what is not.  I will only do a session with my girl.  
Most people  think I&#x27;m crazy trying to speak to the dead.  The only people that supports 
my box research is my fi&#x27;ance, our group, and my Mama.  Mama doesn&#x27;t understand but 
she will always stand by my side on any venture I do.  My Mama is a Saint in my eyes, and 
does nothing wrong.  I might be 30, but in my moms eyes I still the baby boy, and I&#x27;m 
proud to be a mama&#x27;s boy.  Y&#x27;all have a great Sunday afternoon.

&gt;    
&gt;   Kay, since starting box research this past January, 2008, I have had one close friend 
already tell me the responses are nothing but CB or two way radio traffic, and another 
close friend who is devout Catholic said that I am speaking to the devil. Go figure. 
&gt;    
&gt;   My wife listened to the recordings and says she can not hear the responses.
&gt;    
&gt;   I no longer discuss box research outside the EVP/Paranormal friendships I have.
&gt;    
&gt;   Its just like UFO&#x27;s. Some people believe they exist and others believe they are military 
test vehicles.
&gt;    
&gt;   For the past week and a half, I have been assisting Juli in a missing person case, and 
have been doing the box recordings for her. I conected with the boy right away who has 
been missing for over a year, and the info he has given us is info only the police detectives 
know, as it has not been released to the press. The boy has answered every question 
posed to him.
&gt;    
&gt;   Either you believe in spirit contact or you do not. Some people believe in God and 
others do not. 
&gt;    
&gt;   It seems to me the people that do not believe in spirit contact whether through a 
medium, box devices or personal experiences, are those that have never had an 
experience.
&gt;    
&gt;   I have had a handful since my youth and adult life, and from the first one I had, I was 
hooked and never looked back.

&gt;       Hi Kay. Your boyfriend&#x27;s opinion is one of the reasons why I put great weight on 
relevance 
&gt; of content in a session. For example, when I recently asked for Rees&#x27; great uncle to say 
&gt; his name, and an immediate reply of &quot;It&#x27;s Chuck Clarke&quot; is heard (even though Rees 
&gt; referred to him as Charlie, both are nicknames for Charles) I think the odds would be 
quite 
&gt; astronomical of that being coincidence. Same goes for any of us asking a question, any 
&gt; question, and receiving a relevant response ... it would be highly unlikely for it to be 
from 
&gt; stray signals (of whatever flavor.) 
&gt; 
&gt; Then again, if he has trouble even hearing and/or agreeing on the content, it&#x27;s going to 
be 
&gt; hard for you to get him to view an answer as relevant, even when it is.

&gt; &gt; I have let my boyfriend listen to some of my files. He cant seem to 
&gt; &gt; hear anything. (He is a bit hard of hearing) he is saying what we are 
&gt; &gt; hearing is skip from a cb radio or skip in general. Any imput on this?
