<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all you EVP and ITC buffs,

 It&#x27;s me again Ralph just wanting to throw some love around here to 
maybe get back to what this group is all about. That is friendship 
and sharing files and experiments and Ideas of how we can better 
ourselves for making contact with the other side and getting down to 
the Nitty Gritty without the negativity. That sounds like a song LOL. 
Well I myself respect everyone in this group I admire all your hard 
work you guys do and the amount of time you put forth to try to 
understand what all of this is leading to. Your efforts are 
relentless. I myself can only put forth alittle time of what I can 
spare, because of my work and my Wife ( who puts up with all this 
managery ). You see my Wife is Italian and she is all about Family 
and I have to deal with all of her relatives (all 2,000 of them),just 
kidding. They all like to visit and you know how that is LOL !! So I 
do this when I have the chance. I envy all of you that can really get 
down and dirty with all of your research and experiments like you all 
do. I wish I had the time to be like you guys. I love the fact that 
you all share your findings and files and thoughts on how to do 
things better and how you help others who are new to this field like 
me. So all I can say is don&#x27;t let negativity get this group down and 
just keep on doing what you all are here for people. What I hear from 
some of you is that the other side doesn&#x27;t like discord or negativty 
in this effort to communicate with them. This is just my thoughts and 
my feelings about it. Just throwing some Love your way to get 
everybody back on track. I see your almost there. I just want to say 
Peace to all and Keep up the great work for the research.

 Hi Ann,

  Yes I did get your emails on the Chadds Ford case and will be 
getting back to you soon on that. It&#x27;s just something with that 
picture that bothers me. I&#x27;ll talk to you about that too. Have a 
great day Ann.

Hi Juli,

 I will call you when I can about the shadowy figure that maybe 
followed me home. I hope your doing okay Juli and will get back to 
you too. Have a great day also and to everyone in the group. Frank S. 
keep up the fanatstic work your doing too. Mike Colleta I really like 
your Podcasts you crack me up sometimes LOL. Bruce H. that was a 
great interview with you and Mike I enjoyed it alot. Bye for now and 
be good all.

Reagds,

Ralph of SPIRIT Paranormal Investigation Team</pre>
