Exactly! still amazes me that we have voices breaking through a radio that =
shouldnt be their, even if they dont make sense, the point is what the hell=
 are they doing there! but even if they are hoaxing around, just shows they=
 are as human as they were in a present life and like to mess people around=
 because they probably realise people hang on to their every word.

keep up=
 the good work guys!
