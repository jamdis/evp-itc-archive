Before I \nget into that let me explain a bit about myself. I am a  male in his \n30&#39;s, who has Bachelors in Regional Development, with a minor in \nComputer Science. I work at a respective power plant company within \nArizona doing GIS Tech Work. I get drug tested at it on random \noccasion and I really only drink socially, or on some holiday \noccasions. I have always been a logical kind of thinker my whole life \nand never really had any &quot;belief&quot; in the paranormal, even though my \nmom and brother strongly do. \n\nI feel so weird even trying to explain this story because about a \nweek ago I would have thought of it as silly. About a year ago I met \nsomeone else, who for now ill call B. I fell madly in love with her \nand after a short time I was more than happy to have her come and \nlive with me at my new place. In some strange way I always felt as if \nthere was something about B I could never quite understand. After \nabout 3-4 months of living with her I started to get the inclination \nthat B was cheating on me. Her stories never added up, her job was \nsecretive and she started stumbling on her words a lot. \n\nI then started getting spy gadgets, because she was staying with me \nand I was concerned about my place along with her activities there. I \nat first just got a digital recorder, but then after time I started \nto get aggravated and felt that the digital recordings were just \nbeing used to play and taunt me. So then I went to the extent of \ngetting Cameras and even Camcorders. Whenever I would ask about \nsomething peculiar, I got tears and a really heartfelt reaction that \nreally made me believe her. I felt like we really loved one another \nand I could really see some care in her eyes, so most of the time I \njust gave in to what she said as true, but didnt have enough to stop \nlooking. I felt like I had been in enough relationships to know the \ndifference here. I have seen the act before and it really didn&#39;t look \nthat way here, unless she was just really that good at fooling \npeople. \n\nDuring the course of our stay there she would pitch a huge fit if I \nhad to leave her at the apartment alone and would stop at nothing to \ntry and be in my company instead. But I started to get aggravated as \ntime progressed and knew something was up, because of the odd voices \nI would hear within the recordings. I made her stay there will trying \nto sneak back and see who was messing with her around my place. I \nlost it because I couldn&#39;t pinpoint it at all and last July and got \ninto a fight right outside of my place with three other people. She \nalways told me she talked to her self when I qestioned other voices \nand I never could see anyone else there when she did, even with the \ncameras, so I had no choice but to continue on believeing her still\neven though my feelings wouldn&#39;t agree to her words. \n\nFor some odd reason it just seemed as if she knew where the cameras \nand recorders were every time, just by the way she would exit and \nenter the apartment. So then I started putting them outside and about \na month ago something crazy happened. I started listening to a \ndigital recording and at the beginning of it I flat out heard B \ncheating on me with someone. I was upset and happy at the same time \nthat I finally had caught it and as a result I sent her away. She \nleft town because all her family was in another city. She couldn&#39;t \nstop crying and was hysterical, especially when she saw I was \ndevastated too. I thought that I had finally gotten my answers and \nshe was just the best actress I had ever known, end of story. She \ntried to kill herself a couple of times while this was going on a \ncouple months back. If it was as an act or not, I really just don&#39;t \nknow. But when she left last she left a note telling me not to let \nher die and she hopes that I find her soon before her heart stopped. \nMe..I said more BS and threw the note in the garbage. \n\nA couple of day&#39;s later curiosity got the best of me and I started \nlistening to the rest of the recording. I then started to hear what \nsounded like people monitoring ME and calling me a &quot;Threat&quot;. I \nimmediately start acting alarmed. Then in the recording I hear B exit \nthe apartment in disgust after I stormed off that night, as we were \nfighting about something weird yet again.  After I had left she \nstarted talking about setting up a &quot;Private Meeting&quot; with some other \npeople and something about boating. Well during the beginning of this \nmeeting I heard a reference to a crazy accusation that I had made at \nB awhile ago, which to me at the time confirmed she was in the Mafia. \nThat explained all the weirdness to me and during this meeting the \nvoices changed a bunch as if they sounded &quot;Masked&quot; or &quot;Disguised&quot;, so \nI really had to amp up the volume. \n\nThe next day and every day after from this point on I amped up the \nvolume in the recording. I also had to distinguish the masked voice \nby breaking the large file into smaller segments of two to four \nsecond intervals, in order to piece the entire recordings meaning \ntogether. Over time I started to interpret the masked voices better \nbecause I thought I was tuning my ears better to them. The voices in \nthese recordings were two different males, B and some other female. I \nlater on saw in the recording that they had actually seen the \nrecording but weren&#39;t taking it, which was EXTREMELY odd to me \nconsidering they had been caught. Why not destroy the evidence? \n\nThen I heard one of the males say that he was the &quot;Boss of the \nSouthwest Mafia&quot; and that I was going to pay for hurting B like this. \nHe also said that my being a nuisance in the apartment had messed up \nhis business within the area and all my spy stuff had really pissed \nhim off. He told me I was dead, my daughter along with me and more \nthan likely my whole family as well. \n\nHe knew where my mom and dad lived and some information I didn&#39;t even \ntell B. I freak out and figure the damn mob is after me. I keep \nlistening and he says &quot;If I don&#39;t move away and discontinue my \ninteractions with my daughter by December 5th, that he would know \nthat I was just playing with B and then my whole family is dead&quot;. \nThis was exactly one month from when I had used the recording device \ntoo by the way. I moved out and away from my daughter breaking the \ntie and in tears the whole time too because I couldnt explain why. I \nreally did it because I feared for their lives of my family and felt \nthat we would all die if f I didnt. \n\nMeanwhile B and met someone else that ill name J for now. After \nknowing him for two days she decided to bring him back with her to \npick up her things out of the apartment. I was kicking her out of it \nby the way. I thought it was just to piss me off and I forgot about \nit. Then I heard as I progressed in the recording J&#39;s name brought \nup. Supposedly they knew him and he was in their mob and I needed to \ngo attack him to prove myself, or else B will never be seen from me \nagain. I also hear that I can&#39;t go to certain places at certain times \nwhere B might be and furthermore think that they didnt take the \nrecorder because the damn thing has to be planned down to the times I \nwould hear it. \n\nAt this time I am in fear for my life and my families, lost my love \nand I am not understanding how the recording is so damn well time \nplanned, figured im going crazy. Then something ill never forget \nhappens. I am spoken directly too and I figure its me going of the \ndeep end now. I try and test my sanity and go to different parts of \nthe recording only to get the same thing kind of direct question. I \nam in disarray at this point! I stand up and walk around, trying to \nfigure out just what the hell is going on with me. I get back on and \nfurther see that my verbal questions are now being answered instantly \nby this recording (Which is merely a sound file on the pc). *I was \nusing Sound Forge by the way if anyone wanted to know what sound \nsoftware I was using was*.\n\nI have so little sleep at this point and I am told that I need to do \nall this crazy stuff and drive out to the middle of some hotel right \nthen and there, to further see them, as I have passed all their tests \nto get into their mafia now. As a reward B would be there waiting for \nme too. I hurry to do it and rush there but no one is even their to \nanswer the door. I go back and get a yelling voice at me that I had \nleft to early and immediatly go back. Me not wanting to piss the mob \nboss anymore, I take the 45 minute trip again and go back. But when I \nget there it just didn&#39;t feel right to me and I never exited the car, \nespecially when I saw the numbers in vehicles hadnt changed in the \nparking lot. I had plenty reason to be paranoid at this point and \ntruly felt in danger.I left and thought I was done for when I got \nback. Instead, he tells me that he was impressed by my decision when \nand literally puts me in tears when he said that because of my \nintelligence,  I had won my families lives back, but not my own yet. \n\nAll this is done by him also telling me that he can physically see me \nthrough his advanced mafia technology on the computer monitor. He \nalso tells me to to move things around on my compter desk that were \nbetween the sight of me and the computer monitor, while demanding I \ncorrect my posture when speaking to him. He also states that he is \nwatching my every move and if I tell anyone anything they die along \nwith me. \n\nI make no sense of this and I was completely baffled on how I was \nbeing communicated with. I had just moved and there was no internet \nconnection even. Me just being happy my family is safe, I decide to \ngo to sleep. Feeling as though I am now sleep deprived and going \ncrazy from the stress, I go to sleep for two days consistently, as \nthis was during the Thanksgiving holiday time. I would purposely make \nmyself sleep longer when I woke to ensure I didn&#39;t belong in the \nloony bin. \n\nWhen I finally woke up I was determined to find an explanation to how \nthey were talking to me, I go to the library and look into Bluetooth \ntechnology, telephony, and remoting into a computer..anything. Then \nI realize..that I can find out just how crazy I really am by moving \nthe recording and listening to it elsewhere. I then decide to take \nthe same recording into my work to test my saneness, along with the \nfile itself. If its was on my home CPU.then it&#39;s going to now be at \nmy work one too right? I do and get the same damn thing, not to \nmention that the &quot;Mob Boss&quot; now has company two others when I speak \nto him. All of them yelling at me for moving their sensive \ninformation. \n\nDuring this time I invest in GPS, GSM, 3G and several signal blocking \ndevices, in order to prohibit myself from being tracked any further. \nThey never worked or even phased the &quot;Mob Boss&quot;. But I would still \ncheck the recording in the evening just to hear what I needed to do \nin order to be making them happy and get the possibility to see B \nagain. The &quot;Mob Boss&quot; had told me that it was all just a test for me \nto see if I loved her and she never really did do anything. They \ncontinue to tell me over and over that I have to beat up J in order \nto prove myself to B. That this is what everyone is really waiting on \nand if I would just go up to the other town and get it over with, \nthen I can bring her back with me. I won&#39;t do it and say that I won&#39;t \nfight for anything that doesn&#39;t want to be fought for. Basically \nsaying that B can call me about it if she really wants it. Then as a \nresult they start threatening my family again. At this point, I \nreally can&#39;t even express to you how much of a wreck I am. But I felt \nlike I needed to be strong for my family and get on the mob&#39;s good \nside so I can fix the mess I created.\n\nWell it never really happened and this torment went on for a good \nweek, while I was moving everything I could as fast as I could in \norder to make their deadline and save everyone. Everyday I would do \nwhat I thought was expected of me and hope it wouldnt make them mad \nin one breath, while in the other breath win back my complete \nfreedom, away from their bad side. No matter where I was or what I \ndid during the day they usually seemed to know about it when I talked \nto them in the evening. It really bothered me that I couldnt find out \nwhere they were putting the &quot;bugs&quot;, or even better how they were \ndoing all of it. My inability to &quot;believe&quot; in the paranormal really \nhurt me here.\n\nSince the apartment that B and I had used was empty at this time and \na friend of mine was down on his luck, I gave him the apartment for \nfree until the lease was completely up. After about a week of me \ndoing this, I walked in and found guns and ammo everywhere and \nfreaked the hell out. That&#39;s the last thing I needed when I thought \nthe mob was just down the street! I made everyone there except my \nfriend leave, with quite a fuss I might add. Then I headed back to my \nhome to see how the mob felt about what I did, assure they would be \nimpressed that I had looked out for them. Instead the regular female \nthat was always with the &quot;Mob Boss&quot; now asked me why I didn&#39;t finish \nthe job, stating that there was still someone there and it made them \nall angry. They demanded that I go back especially to see just how &quot;I \nfinished it&quot;. \n\nSo like the puppet I was at that time, I went back. I didn&#39;t have the \nheart to put him on the street, even though he had put me at a major \nrisk and instead I just found another place for him to stay. On the \nway there I bought him some water and some smokes. When we got there \nI even helped him move in and explained that it wasn&#39;t me that did \nit, but the leasing office had saw all the guns. As a result they had \nmade me do it. I thought he made a poor decision and I knew he saw \nthe same, not to mention I kind of felt bad that I had to do all of \nthis to him at 11:30PM. I truly didnt want to make his life a \ncomplete hell any more than it already was and he felt better that I \nhad talked to him, so as a result I did as well. I then left and once \nagain headed back home. \n\nCertain that I was going to get good praises; I sat at the PC again \nonly to immediately get yelled at. They asked me why I was &quot;so good&quot; \nand that they had absolutely no respect for me. I tell them I just \ndid all of that for them and they say that I always do things &quot;the \nright way&quot; and they hate me for it. This is where I think I hit the \nloony bin and just didnt see how I was going to fix this problem. \nThen it got worse and saw that my thoughts were now being \ncommunicated back to me. Then I knew it and was convinced I was going \nskitzo and that i was just truly arguing with myself in reality, \nespecially when I saw I wasn&#39;t even speaking. I used the restroom, \nsplash water on my face and faintly start to hear the same mob people \nin my fan motor in the bathroom.  I haven&#39;t drank, done any drugs \n(even prescription) and have a pretty complex job which I can still \nhandle, but yet I feel like I am going crazy. \n\nI can&#39;t talk to anyone about it so I sit back at the CPU, only to \nhear that I need to open up the front door. Screw that!I just look \nout the window and see nothing and say no way. They ask why not and \nthat I should trust them and I say hell no and I continue to \nhear &quot;God Damnit&quot; from them when they get mad. They continue to ask \nme to open the door and I continue to check the window to see \nnothing. I say to knock then and they get mad and say they have no \nhands. They don&#39;t sound like they are joking and get mad when I laugh \neven, so I continue to think I am just crazy at this point. I asked \nwhy they wanted to come in and they said they wanted to fix me. I say \nthere is nothing wrong with me and they say they hate me and want to \neat me.\n\nI start to really think about this and say ill open the door if I get \nthe answers to all this. They start saying things and its if as \nthough they see my thought process develop and say things like&quot;watch \nhim go&quot;. Then I hear out of my computer monitor something I couldnt \neven fathom. I hear my ex-wife&#39;s ex-best friends voice. His name was \nDaniel and he had committed suicide over 5 years ago. I did know him, \nbut not as well as she had. It WAS his voice and he said &quot;Charles its \nDaniel&quot; and then I heard their voice again say we are &quot;down here with \nhim&quot;. At this point I didnt know really what to think, but this part \nin our conversation was the turning point on my beliefs and thoughts \non what was really going on.  \n\nI say nothing yet they somehow can seem to hear my thoughts and start \nsaying little things to make me think even more. It was the most \nfluent conversation I had ever had. It was truly telepathic and was \non a level I could never really explain even to myself. Then it \nreally hit me and I said &quot;Demons&quot;. I tried to play something and got \nno response for the first time ever on the sound file. I then started \npiecing it all together from there and even though I wasn&#39;t a \nbeliever this makes more sense then I could ever write down here and \nas a result I forever will be one now. \n\nThey ask for me to now open the door and I open the small glass door \non my CPU desk and they get really pissed off, saying I tricked them. \nThen their voice changed to the most demonic, vile and disturbing \nvoice I could ever put into words. I never really thought of doing \nthat until that moment and I think it was seen from them reaction, \nbut it worked out quite nicely. I start saying the our father prayer \nand I can hear the displeasure in them even more and heard &quot;that&#39;s it \nwe are going in&quot;. I immediately took off my headphones and ran to get \na bible they never did as far as I can tell, but I sat there all \nnight with the bible in my hand praying. \n\nI started calling people and my phone started cutting out, the bulb \non the porch blew and my good friend&#39;s girlfriend called me to ask me \nfor help because my friend was drunk and passed out. It sounded like \nshe was trying to flirt with me and I asked her how &quot;A&quot; nightclub was \nand she said good and then I said didn&#39;t you actually go to &quot;B&quot; \nnightclub actually and she switches her story. I hang up and call \nback with no answer. The time was only 1:10am and they never leave \nuntil the clubs close so this was even odder. \n\nI sat there terrified most of the night praying, until I called my \nbrother who told me that I have to stand up to them or I am feeding \ninto their fear. He like my mom has been involved in similar things \nlike this but after talking to both of them, neither have on this \nlevel. But in a refreshing breath after talking to them about this, \nthey did seem to believe me. But it wasnt unil I researched this \nissue and found out about EVP and how it works, did I truly know that \nI wasnt becoming a lunatic.\n\nThat brings me to today and me being at my wits end. I swear on \neverything this is all 100% true and I feel like I am crazy even \nstill. Even though I hear it from no one else and have a pretty good \ncircle of friends, not to mention that I still seem to do my job just \nfine as well. I havent put on my headphones or heard any voices since \nI tried to last listen to the recording, which was now 3 days ago. \nDoes anyone have any help and guidance here, as this all has really \ndestroyed my life. I deleted all the copies of the recording, except \nfor one hardcopy. I still have the original recorder with the file \non, but I haven&#39;t tried to use the recording or recorder any further, \nas I refuse to continue it without any guidance. I figure its best to \navoid them, like my brother said. Maybe someone can help me \nunderstand all of this.  Even if I have gotten rid of these things \nwhat does that say of B? I really spent a bunch of time making this \nreally need some genuine help from someone in the know. I know it \nsounds crazy but please regard this all as true. I am new to this \nstuff and will just stay away from it now, but some kind of insight \nwould be great."}
