I have had enough \npublic. \n\n I&#39;ll keep my site updated, and this group will stay intact with other \nowners, unless they bail, and I wouldn&#39;t blanme them! Trying to be \npublic, and share information has resulted only in argavation, and \nattacks by vile, evil people, such as Jody, and her freinds. \n\n\n Frank"}
