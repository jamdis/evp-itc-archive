Hi Jan,
  I can say I agree with Misty in that you dont have to go to a 'haunted' place to get evps- i get just as many if not more so from my house than anywhere else.... i guess they follow us around... when we go the cemetary... they are there simply because THEY followed US there...
  lol
  I also know that in the beggining for me, i WAS getting evps- but my ear was not 'trained'enough to hear them,.... i found them later in review of my files.
  So you 'might ' be doing better than you think... but dont worry- its just a matter of time b4 your spirit friends start chatting at you
  and do try new methods.... you never know what might work :)
good luck and keep us posted
  ;)

            Hi Jan
   
  Hmmm well I would like to pretend I know why some people get evp with little effort while others do not. I can only say that whenever I sit down to do a session they are always there. When it started for me it wasnt something I planned just a happy accident.
   
  I believe Sarah Estep had quite a difficult time when she first started to record. Her idea/suggestion was to record on a regular basis such as daily around the same time and maintaining her focus to communicate.
   
  There are many methods to enhance communication including using background sounds, sweep tuning, etc. I outlined a few aside from Franks boxes on my website. Can find a link under links if curious. 
   
  Try something new and perhaps that will get you started. Once the bridge is open and communication has begun it tends to become more often and clearer to your ears. Some speak louder than others, or faster than others. 
   
  Best advice I can give if you want to get your own communication line open is just announce you are recording and invite someone to speak to you and most of all keep trying. I never record in graveyards or "haunted" locations because I have come to believe they can be found anywhere. They hunt me I dont hunt them =)

      Hi Everyone,

I have been to lots of haunted places like Gettysburg, Eastern State 
Penitentiary, and many other documented haunted places and have not 
captured any evp's at all. Just wondering if it is just me or am I 
doing it all wrong? I bring a voice recorder that uses a standard 
recording tape and can't hear anything unusual. Any suggestions on how 
I can try to get some voices would be great. I am open-minded to the 
spirit world and have seen spirits but not heard from them. Would like 
to try to capture some voices. Any suggestions would be great!

Thanks very much,

Jan
