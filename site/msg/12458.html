<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Actually I don&#x27;t know you and therefore can&#x27;t
say if I like you or not. I will say that I&#x27;ve heard
who first came up with the RS Hack and your
name wasn&#x27;t it.

I have posted many of my recordings to this
list, but don&#x27;t store them here. I&#x27;ve also heard
your files. So? Nothing I haven&#x27;t heard before,
but as always I enjoy listening to everyone&#x27;s efforts.

What I don&#x27;t like is an attitude and egomania
when it comes to this research.

Next I guess you&#x27;ll challenge me to a recording
duel? LOL. Give that ego a rest.

&gt; You&#x27;re right and i&#x27;m not here to argue with anyone. You obviously
&gt; don&#x27;t know me, but dislike me. That&#x27;s ok, i like to get along with
&gt; people; it helps the research move forward. I would love to hear some
&gt; of your files from your frank&#x27;s boxes and compare notes on what we&#x27;ve
&gt; been getting. My results are in the files section here.

&gt; &gt; So have I. So has Misty. So has Frank. Mike too. I could go on &amp; on.
&gt; &gt; There are many here and on other lists who have contributed years of
&gt; &gt; free time way before you showed up on the recording scene.
&gt; &gt; Does it matter? No.
