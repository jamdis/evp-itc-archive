But the good news is it can\nalso be tre=\r\nated with two different drugs. They are Tamiflu and Relenza.\n\nOne of the be=\r\nst things to always do is wash your hands after handling anything\nand being=\r\n out in the public. A little trick I learned a long time ago is to\nsing to =\r\nyourself the Birthday song while washing your hands. I know it sounds\nsilly=\r\n, but it ensures that you hands are properly cleaned. &quot;Happy birthday to\nme=\r\n, happy birthday to me, happy birthday dear ______, happy birthday to me.&quot; =\r\n\nSilly, but it works LOL :-)\n\nHere is some info from WebMd\n_________\n\nSwine=\r\n Flu FAQ\nWebMD Provides Answers to Your Questions About Swine Flu\nBy Mirand=\r\na Hitti\n\nThe swine flu virus in the U.S. is the same one causing a deadly e=\r\npidemic in\nMexico. What is swine flu? What can we do about it? WebMD answer=\r\ns your\nquestions.\n\nWhat is swine flu?\nLike people, pigs can get influenza (=\r\nflu), but swine flu viruses aren&#39;t the same\nas human flu viruses. Swine flu=\r\n doesn&#39;t often infect people, and the rare human\ncases that have occurred i=\r\nn the past have mainly affected people who had direct\ncontact with pigs. Bu=\r\nt the current swine flu outbreak is different. It&#39;s caused\nby a new swine f=\r\nlu virus that has spread from person to person -- and it&#39;s\nhappening among =\r\npeople who haven&#39;t had any contact with pigs.\n\nWhat are swine flu symptoms?=\r\n\nSymptoms of swine flu are like regular flu symptoms and include fever, cou=\r\ngh,\nsore throat, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue. Some people hav=\r\ne\nreported diarrhea and vomiting associated with swine flu. Those symptoms =\r\ncan\nalso be caused by many other conditions, and that means that you and yo=\r\nur doctor\ncan&#39;t know, just based on your symptoms, if you&#39;ve got swine flu.=\r\n It takes a lab\ntest to tell whether it&#39;s swine flu or some other condition=\r\n.\n\nIf I think I have swine flu, what should I do? When should I see my doct=\r\nor?\nIf you have flu symptoms, stay home, and when you cough or sneeze, cove=\r\nr your\nmouth and nose with a tissue. Afterward, throw the tissue in the tra=\r\nsh and wash\nyour hands. That will help prevent your flu from spreading.\n\nIf=\r\n you&#39;ve got flu symptoms, and you&#39;ve recently been to a high-risk area like=\r\n\nMexico, CDC officials recommend that you see your doctor. If you have flu\n=\r\nsymptoms but you haven&#39;t been in a high-risk area, you can still see a doct=\r\nor --\nthat&#39;s your call.\n\nKeep in mind that your doctor will not be able to =\r\ndetermine whether you have\nswine flu, but he or she would take a sample fro=\r\nm you and send it to a state\nhealth department lab for testing to see if it=\r\n&#39;s swine flu. If your doctor\nsuspects swine flu, he or she would be able to=\r\n write you a prescription for\nTamiflu or Relenza. Those drugs may not be re=\r\nquired; U.S. swine flu patients\nhave made a full recovery without it.\n\nI Go=\r\nt a Flu Shot. Am I Protected Against Swine Flu?\nNo. There is currently no s=\r\nwine flu vaccine.\n\nIt&#39;s possible that the seasonal flu vaccine might provid=\r\ne partial protection\nagainst H3N2 swine flu bugs. But the strain that appea=\r\nred in California is the\nH1N1 swine flu strain. It is very different from t=\r\nhe H1N1 human flu strain\nincluded in the seasonal flu vaccine.\n\nIt&#39;s not kn=\r\nown whether previous infection with human type A H1N1 flu might\nprovide par=\r\ntial protection against the type A H1N1 swine flu in the current\noutbreak.\n=\r\n\nHowever, the CDC has made a &quot;vaccine seed&quot; from swine flu isolated from an=\r\n\ninfected person, and has begun the process of developing a vaccine should =\r\nthe\nneed arise. Whether a vaccine could be produced in quantity by next flu=\r\n season\nis a huge question.\n\nHow Serious Is the Public Health Threat of a S=\r\nwine Flu Epidemic?\nAny flu epidemic is worrisome, especially when a new str=\r\nain of flu bug is\ninvolved.\n\n&quot;Influenza A viruses new to the human populati=\r\non that are able to efficiently\ntransmit from person to person and cause il=\r\nlness may represent a pandemic\nthreat,&quot; the CDC warns.\n\nIt&#39;s worrisome that=\r\n, unlike seasonal flu, the swine flu outbreak in Mexico is\nattacking health=\r\ny young people. That&#39;s a hallmark of pandemic flu bugs.\n\nBut it takes more =\r\nthan a new virus spreading among humans to make a pandemic.\nThe virus has t=\r\no be able to spread efficiently from one person to another, and\ntransmissio=\r\nn has to be sustained over time. In addition, the virus has to spread\ngeogr=\r\naphically.\n\nIs There a Treatment for Swine Flu?\nYes. While the swine flu bu=\r\ng is resistant to older flu medicines, it remains\nsensitive to Tamiflu and =\r\nto Relenza.\n\nCan You Get Swine Flu by Eating Pork?\nNo. You can only catch s=\r\nwine flu from being around an infected pig -- or, if\nit&#39;s the new swine flu=\r\n virus, from an infected person.\n=C2=A0&quot;Nature is showing us only the tail =\r\nof the lion, but I have no doubt that the lion belongs to it even though, b=\r\necause of its large size, it cannot totally reveal itself all at once.&quot; \n-=\r\n=E2=80=94 Albert Einstein \n\n\n&quot;It is far better to grasp the universe as it =\r\nreally is than to persist in delusions, however satisfying and reassuring.&quot;=\r\n\n--Carl Sagan\n\n\n&quot;There is no such thing as an insignificant detail.
