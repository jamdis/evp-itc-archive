  Thanks for the warm welcome.  I have only read a little on Franks box, and became interested.  I have read through the old newsletter I think they were called spirit voices, awhile back.  I was given all the newsletters that came out at the time.  A few years back, when I did went through them, there were a lot of information and schematics on researchers during the 60-80�s doing the same research with real time as what everyone here is researching.  
  
  I look forward to reading more and listening to the files people post.  I do have one question I hope you can answer; I�m not sure how this group sends evp files to each other.  Do they attach them to the email or upload them to the yahoo group.  Any advice would be appreciated.

  Mercy,
 
welcome to our group, my name is Bruce.
this group is dedicated to EVP and ITC research in all forms, but you will find mostly box researchers here.
we are a rare breed in the EVP field. We use what most people refer to as Frank's box, although there are several alternative similar boxes that are widely used by most
researchers here.
Box communication differs from Traditional EVP in the way that doing research and what we call sessions with a box allows the user to have two way live, real time communication with the spirit world.
 
the details of the research are much to complicated to go into in a welcome post, but If you are interested in getting involved in box research or have any questions. Please feel free to contact me or post your questions here. there are many knowledgeable researchers here that can help.
 
the method of EVP you mention With EVP maker was only introduced here a couple of days ago and I myself and a few other researchers have barely had time to experiment with it.
I did however post a number of files from this method in my folder "Bruce's box files" located in the files section.
 
If you have any questions or need help getting started you can e-mail me paranormalinvestigating@...
I'll be more than happy to help.
 
Bruce

        Hello Everyone,

  
  
  I just joined this group, and started ready through the messages last night.  I am not new to EVP research; I have been doing this research and keeping records for the past 5 years.  I am excited about the method you are all trying now using EVP Maker and the wav file on the alphabet.  I would also like to try this, in the past I have used a white noise generator, fan, water, light harp music, and even tried using the parabolic microphone to amplify the spirits voice coming through on the computer.  
  
  I look forward to sharing any ideas with the group, and hopefully someone can direct me more on the research you are all trying.  Would like to contribute to the group in any way I can.  Now off to listen to some of the evps captured through this method�J
  
  Mercy
