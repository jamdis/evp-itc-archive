We appreciate your insights and energetic efforts to put ITC in the 
spotlight where it deserves to be.

Thanks,
Lance

&gt; Last night’s C2C show with George Noory on Frank’s Box and 
similar ITC
&gt; devices went well despite the limitations of the broadcast studio in
&gt; Sherman Oaks, CA.  We were just too well shielded for the boxes to
&gt; scan properly.  I had on hand my Frank’s Ghost Box 22, Ron 
Ricketts’
&gt; very first Mini-Box to come out of production, the Radio Shack Hack,
&gt; and a Craig’s Box, a modified Daewoo car stereo done by Craig 
Telesha.
&gt;  In addition, I had a gold-beryllium alloy antenna made by Marcus 
Leader.
&gt; 
&gt; There’s no doubt about it, the box technologies and spirit
&gt; communication are hot topics, and will continue to be in the
&gt; spotlight, especially as more people are able to obtain a device. 
&gt; Hopefully, this will lay to rest the nonsense about a “circle 
of 30”
&gt; or any such ridiculous claims of monopoly on who can and should use
&gt; boxes.  Box technology is already democratic.  As more people obtain
&gt; and work with them, many possibilities for coordinated research and
&gt; experiments will unfold.
&gt; 
&gt; As an interdimensional interface, the boxes are neutral.  They are 
not
&gt; dark, demonic, negative, etc., as some fearful people worry.  
Negative
&gt; experiences are always possible, just as in any work in the
&gt; paranormal.  People who don’t know what they are doing, who are 
in it
&gt; for a lark, and who harbor fears and anxieties about the paranormal
&gt; are not well-suited to any kind of paranormal exploration, whether
&gt; it’s with a box, in automatic writing, or with a deck of Tarot 
cards.
&gt; 
&gt; Rick Moran, the executive director of the Association for the study 
of
&gt; Unexplained Phenomena, the sponsors of the research for the Mini-
Box,
&gt; shared some observations with me after the show that illuminate the
&gt; topic.  Here are his comments:
&gt; 
&gt; There is a connection between every one of the designers/technicians
&gt; who have worked on the box from its inception by Spiricom. Every one
&gt; of them was a licensed Ham Radio Operator, including Frank, Ron and
&gt; Myself.
&gt; 
&gt; Someone asked about different antennas… because of the Ham 
connection,
&gt; that has been done already. The original Spiricom was an enormous
&gt; device and operated on the ham bands because it was the only part of
&gt; the spectrum that could offer a clear channel. They tried both
&gt; vertical and horizontal antennas. We did the same in our early
&gt; devices, both Ron and I have “antenna farms” as do many of 
the ASUP
&gt; investigators, who are also hams.
&gt; 
&gt; Spiricom sounded very robotic, due in part to the equipment being
&gt; used… tubes and crystals to set the frequency. This was common
&gt; practice through the 1980s.  I recently heard someone spouting a
&gt; theory that because the Spiricom used a crystal system, it was 
somehow
&gt; mystical in nature. Crystals were used in all ham radios, all 
military
&gt; radios and a lot of commercial applications… nothing mystical at 
all.
&gt;  
&gt; I think Frank dropped the crystal frequency generation due to cost 
in
&gt; favor of a plain old radio tuner he pulled from an old receiver. 
Most
&gt; of his designs were admittedly adaptations of junk radios, which is
&gt; what separates his from ours. We spared no expense in designing
&gt; circuits that were critical to a clean signal.
&gt; 
&gt; In your discussion last night, George did not even mention the EARTH
&gt; SOUNDS project at NASA on the Ultra Low Frequency Bands. Down there
&gt; NASA has been hearing “voices” for years, which they admit, 
they can’t
&gt; explain. As you might have already guessed, that is one of our
&gt; upcoming projects. The great problem there is the length of the
&gt; antenna, to do it right an ULF antenna would be buried and would be
&gt; about 11 MILES long.  In the production model of the MiniBox, Ron 
hand
&gt; tuned the antennas, winding row upon row of fine wire to match the
&gt; necessary length of the frequencies being scanned, another 
difference
&gt; that helped to eliminate noise and upgrade the voice quality.
&gt; ____
&gt; Thanks, Rick.  And thanks to Frank, Ron, Craig, Marcus and all the
&gt; other researchers in the ITC field.
