  Wow Robin you gave =
me flashbacks LOL. Dont feel bad. Same thing happened to me except it didnt=
 even fly out of my hands, the hack seemed to go fine, but when I went to p=
ut it back together the wire came undone from the battery casing so he went=
 to his friends house and resoldered it on for me brought it back put it in=
 my hands for me to put the screws in and I noticed now there was a big bla=
ck wire from the speaker section undone as well. He then went back to his f=
riends resoldered that wire, brought it back, I put it together and powers =
up, scans fine...manual...auto...BUT there are no stations being picked up =
at all. LOL

  Worked fine before I touched it (reception wise) but now its=
 sittin in a box waitin for me to mail it to Franks radio graveyard soon as=
 I get my butt in gear now that the holiday mail rush is coming to an end. =
He said he can probably fix it. I bet he can LOL its probably just another =
wire come undone I didnt see underneath. Or somethin i did wrong. I aint op=
ening it again they will all fly off at me or somethin if i do LOL. Or he c=
an rip it to shreds for the parts. Gonna leave the building to the builders=
. Mike just had to go and make it look so dang easy I couldnt resist tearin=
g one apart hehehe

  And tear it apart I did =3D)
