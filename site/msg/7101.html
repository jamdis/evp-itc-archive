<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Welcome to the great Seven mystery, Nellie. A lot of people get the  
name/word. I get it constantly. I can&#x27;t tell if it an entity or a  
confirmation word like, &quot;copy,&quot; which I also get a lot. Rosemary also  
gets Seven and know others on this list have in the past. There is  
some theory that this is a collective entity that was involved in the  
ITC bridge group back in the 1980s, but it could just as easily be  
something the current technicians decided to use to comfort us. We  
really don&#x27;t know at this point.

&gt; &gt; entities. Amidst the swearing, &quot;Problem, Seven.&quot; I hear an  
&gt; English accent.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m at work where I can&#x27;t download the file. However, this message
&gt; has me intrigued already. A friend of mine just started experimenting
&gt; with a Shack hack last night and also got a message of &quot;seven&quot;. When
&gt; she asked for clarification, the response was &quot;you&#x27;ll see&quot;. Hmmm.
