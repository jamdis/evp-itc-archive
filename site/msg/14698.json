Someone should give it a try. They are loud enough to hear...just can&#39;t seperate the syllables--- In EVP-ITC@...m, SnowfireL@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey, If you guys can&#39;t hear this now, I don&#39;t know what to do with  you \n&gt; guys and gals, I made this louder so, you should be able to catch everything  \n&gt; they are saying.  Love it!  It moves quickly, the 3 guys are saying,  &quot;Rat! \n&gt; Yepper, now two,  &quot;where&#39;s the supper at? Parden  mouse, pregnant, yeah.   \n&gt; What&#39;s makes this so cool is I do have a  pregnant mouse, probably a few of \n&gt; them.  So, this for me is proof  positive!!!  Feel bad for anyone who can&#39;t \n&gt; hear this, give me a call and I  will play it over the phone for you.  sf\n&gt; **************A Good Credit Score is 700 or Above.
