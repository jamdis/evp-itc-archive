<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi everyone,

A few people have seen my ebay listing and commented about the price 
listed.

Ebay will not allow you to change a description after the item has 
been listed. They do however allow you to add and amending statement.

Which I have done In Big Bold Red Letters, the price listing was a 
mistake. I am certainly not trying to misrepresent the item or make a 
profit on it.

I have also lowered the reserve price on it as a result of the 
mistake.
Believe me I will be taking a loss on the box.

I have already sent my apologies to Rick Moran from Paranormal 
systems.

And now extend my apologies for the mistake to anyone that was 
interested in it.

The reason for selling the MB was not the money, it was the guilt of 
having this excellent piece of equipment go without the attention it 
deserves. And the hopes that someone or some group can utilize it 
more than myself.

But I could not as much as I would have liked to, give it away.
My intention was to get back at least a decent amount of my 
investment.

I hope no one gets the wrong idea and thinks ill of me.

Bruce</pre>
