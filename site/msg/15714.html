<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi everyone,

What I do want to ask, and maybe someone could explain for me, what *is* 
the benefit of asking the Box a question. 

Also - and please don&#x27;t anyone yell at me, when I see the video&#x27;s, I see 
people on occasion grasping at what they think they might hear. 

Extrapolate if you will, , when you use the Box, am I correct in 
understanding that you record the raw data, clean it up, and then listen 
to it.
If that is the case, do you find that you get clear words. Do they tend 
to develop after a little clearing up of background sounds.

To the group in general, do you receive clarity more so than gibberish? 
Does the group find that trends will develop. I think I heard Mr. Murphy 
say, that quite a few people were receiving a lot of the same information.

Does anyone get clear &#x27;predictions&#x27;. Is there any need to &#x27;translate&#x27; 
the messages?

Frank, when you say bogus prediction, what do you mean by that?

What is a good prediction?

OK, lets ask the obvious question, what &#x27;is&#x27; considered a prediction 
from the Box?

The one thing I am missing here is when one, (anyone) uses the 
apparatus, why are they using it, do they have a pre-set result they are 
seeking.

Do you use it to prove or disprove spirit in a particular location?

What other questions should I be asking?

Does one hear more &#x27;male&#x27; or &#x27;female&#x27; sounding voices, can on determine 
the gender of the voice?

Is it always a &#x27;voice&#x27; that is coming through?

Another question, does Franks box speak in different languages and has 
anyone been able dig deeper into that, and has anyone recorded a voice 
in what they thought was gibberish only to find it was a different language.

Has any &#x27;new&#x27; languages been heard/recorded.

What about speech patterns through history, does the group find that the 
voices use older language styles or is it syntax/language we understand.

Sorry, I have so many questions, I hope nobody will think them dumb or 
not worthy of an answer, I do want to know.

Has anyone had a box that just never worked for a certain person, but 
would for others?


Deb

PS another really dumb question, how does one *know* the response comes 
from a spirit, can it be another type of entity, can it be a ET, can it 
be echo&#x27;s through time or future, other dimensions, I guess even a 
religious possibility arises too.</pre>
