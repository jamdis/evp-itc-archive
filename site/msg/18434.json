I continue to be blown away by the fears and insecurities and cliches of some of the people involved in RTSC. The group says:  \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This Board is dedicated solely to the research of Real Time Spirit Communication. Any form of devices that are used in 2-way communication are welcome here openly for all to share. This group is for the discussion, promotion and development of new ideas to further this research. This group was designed to take the next step in EVP to get away from conventional methods.  -Steve Hultay&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I suggest it add: \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Unless you ask questions, experiment outside our box, or don&#39;t agree with what we state is so.   Then you can&#39;t join&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Amazing.\n&gt;"}
