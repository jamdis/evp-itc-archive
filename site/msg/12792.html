Oh yeah, the debate in the Catholic Church philosophical circles that has 
been going on for ages - how many angels can fit on the head of a pin?

Bob Weir even made reference to it in his song &quot;Weather Report Suite.&quot;
(Or maybe John Barlow wrote the lyrics.)
:-)

But we are definitely dealing with the non-physical here, so any ideas 
that try to correlate a spirit to something physical can be thrown out the 
window. While it is true that they appear to be coexisting in the physical 
universe, there&#x27;s no reason to assume they are limited by it.

I have dozens of EVP I&#x27;ve gotten in the former Manteno State Mental 
Hospital in Illinois.  And you know what? Whatever made those EVP&#x27;s still 
seems to be crazy. And these were apparently made by spirits who no longer 
have physical bodies.  So much for the idea of &quot;chemical imbalances in the 
brain&quot; being the root of insanity! A ghost doesn&#x27;t have a brain.

I think Hamlet summed it up the best:

&quot;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in 
your philosophy.&quot;

I constantly remind myself of that.
