Apr 2008Von: b=\r\nhali333&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Everyone,&gt; &gt; I would lik=\r\ne to make a serious suggestion.&gt; As a senior researcher in the live spirit =\r\ncommunication field, Myself &gt; and a few other researchers here such as Stev=\r\ne hultay, Ann, LC&gt; Just to mention a couple have strived since the beginnin=\r\ng to try and &gt; advance the technology, communication and relations with our=\r\n spirit &gt; friends or whatever entities are participating in this communicat=\r\nion &gt; research.&gt; &gt; In order to call this research it must continue to move =\r\nforward.&gt; There are more than enough of the new people here, that do not &gt; =\r\nqualify as new people anymore. But full fledged researchers. Of &gt; course th=\r\ney have much to learn, but so do we all.&gt; &gt; Which brings me to my suggestio=\r\nn.&gt; Steve and I have recently been discussing the point we have reached &gt; i=\r\nn the research, both in process and knowledge. We agreed on most &gt; points,&gt;=\r\n the most important one being. It is time to move beyond the same &gt; mundane=\r\n session content and the same rudimentary line of questioning.&gt; &gt; This rese=\r\narch is stagnating for lack of direction, any posted files &gt; or discussions=\r\n revolve around the same stale subjects such as, &gt; &quot;Is there anyone there t=\r\nhat wishes to communicate&quot;, &gt; &quot;What is your name&quot;&gt; &quot;who am I speaking with&quot;=\r\n&gt; &quot;what is it like where you are&quot;&gt; &gt; I believe we have all received every c=\r\nombination of answer to those &gt; questions that we possibly can, yet we cont=\r\ninue to ask them session &gt; after session. And still become amazed at a yes =\r\nor no answer or the &gt; simplest of phrases.&gt; &gt; I am not saying this about an=\r\ny single level of researcher but all of &gt; us myself included have fallen in=\r\nto this rut. We are not learning &gt; anything, All our efforts are amounting =\r\nto nothing.&gt; &gt; We already know that we are communicating with someone or so=\r\nmething. &gt; I believe we have all come to believe that through our personal =\r\n&gt; research and the evidence presented by all of us.&gt; &gt; Within the last year=\r\n the technology and potential of this type of &gt; research has exceeded all e=\r\nxpectations in it&#39;s quality and speed of &gt; development. We are actually let=\r\nting it go to waste.&gt; &gt; I and a few other researchers believe that whoever =\r\nis on the other &gt; side of the line has had a hand in some of us developing =\r\nthis new &gt; equipment and methods of research be it obvious or subtle.&gt; &gt; Bu=\r\nt our methods of research have not excelled, we are conducting &gt; research i=\r\nn the same manner as we did when there where only about 5 &gt; of us in the wh=\r\nole world actively doing this research.&gt; &gt; New individuals are joining our =\r\nranks and becoming interested in box &gt; research every day. The protocol the=\r\ny are being instructed to use is &gt; antiquated and obsolete.&gt; &gt; It is fine t=\r\no teach them these methods as a basic foundation of the &gt; research and to g=\r\net their feet wet. But like any other education &gt; process it must evolve an=\r\nd develop with the accumulation of knowledge.&gt; &gt; If we approached academic =\r\neducation the way we approach box research, &gt; we would all still be in the =\r\nfirst grade.&gt; &gt; I propose a committee to develop a method of research and p=\r\nrotocol &gt; that can deal with the ever evolving technology and decide what a=\r\nnd &gt; how we should approach the type of communication we seek and the &gt; sub=\r\nject matter that should be addressed, that will be continually &gt; changing.&gt;=\r\n &gt; Only in this way will the wheels of research and learning move &gt; forward=\r\n and we will gain the knowledge we seek and hopefully be able &gt; to share it=\r\n with the world someday.&gt; &gt; But if we continue to ask &quot;Is anyone there will=\r\ning to speak with me&quot;&gt; We are doomed.&gt; &gt; Anyone that wishes to discuss this=\r\n and give opinions or suggestions&gt; please lets try and get started every mi=\r\nnute we waste is a missed &gt; opportunity for learning.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; &gt; &gt; -------=\r\n-----------------------------&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
