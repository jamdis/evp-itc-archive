The entities seemto be from a &quot;lower&quot; realm, especially the last one. But I think they are great technically, as I have complete sentances.\n\nThe first is &quot;Tell it to the Chief&quot; another voice replies &quot;mighty, mighty HOT&quot;\n\nThe second one sounds like a ded terrorist, complete with the eastern accent &quot;I rape your sister--I molest you TOO&quot;\n\nCheck my tom&#39;s tube/tom&#39;s file folder."}
