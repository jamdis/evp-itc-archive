I&#39;ve been working with Rosemary Ellen Guiley, Rick Fisher and a\nfew other individuals with an ongoing ITC project that started in May.\nRosemary brought Box 22 and Box 23L along last week. We let box 22 run\nby itself in another room and took 23L to another area of the location\nand attempted to ask a few questions. I am still listening to all of\nthe audio from these sessions, but the uploaded file was something we\nall heard loud and clear from the box, so I was hoping to get some\nimpressions on it. \n\nCraig T"}
