Plus, he claims he&#39;s acting like a Medium connecting the \nliving  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with their departed loved ones (what proof is there of this? \nI&#39;d  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; love to hear from my Dad, but may have to wait a LONG time for \nthat  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to happen)!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Again, I&#39;ve got to speak up and say that I have heard his box, \nthe  \n&gt; &gt; one Frank gave him, do exactly that. And why in the heck \nshouldn&#39;t  \n&gt; &gt; it? That is exactly what human mediums--myself included--can do.  \n&gt; &gt; Isn&#39;t the box just taking it to a potentially purer, higher, and \nmore  \n&gt; &gt; stunning level?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;d contact a lawyer - for infringment rights to your device  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (unauthorised use), on a contingency basis (pay if you win the  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lawsuit, from the winnings). Plus, you could get your boxes, \nSony  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; cassette recorder, and Tarot CD back, as well as put him outta  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; business, before he does more damage! =Judy= P.S. He may know \nyou  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; well enought to know you&#39;ll never sue him, too (and thus get \naway  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with it)! 8-(\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can&#39;t sue for use of non-patented technology that was a gift. \nIt  \n&gt; &gt; would be very hard for Frank to prove otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ah, but what a hell of a civil trial it would be. There&#39;s one \nI&#39;d  \n&gt; &gt; love to cover as a reporter....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =     Hi All, What&#39;s to keep Chris \nfrom getting a Patent of his own on HIS &quot;Telephone to The Dead&quot;? Does \nFrank have his &quot;Franks Box&quot; Patented by the U.S. Patent Offices (the \ncost is low for this, BTW)???? I think it has merit thus far, for \nFrank to consider a Lawsuit! So what if it was a gift, Frank stated \nit was to be used in 1 place (statonary) & for testing purposes ONLY. \nWhat Chris has done with it, is Run with it making several businesses \nwith it and making a profit from it . . . . this is NOT what Frank \nintended HIS Box(es) to be used as!   =Judy=\n&gt;"}
