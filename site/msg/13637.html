Good questions Earl.=A0 I think the answer depends on your plan for the fil=
e.=A0 If it just for yourself, then I guess any name will do, that helps to=
 best organize your data, and helps you in your overall research or goals.=

And when sending it to others, it also depends on your goals.=A0 If y=
ou're in phase of wanting to get confirmation of what you believe you have =
captured, or general input on your technique, then maybe labeling it by the=
 content works for that.=A0 If you are in a phase where you want to improve=
 your technique, and want verify, as objectively as possible, what you have=
 recorded, then naming it by perhaps the date and time and some sequence ID=
 number would be better, so as to remove as much potential as possible that=
 the name would influence the listener?

       =
     reading Rick's and Frank"s comments here i started to wonder.

what is=
 the best way to post EVP's ??

i know to crop out the segment that has the=
 EVP you want others to hear 

and see if they can make it out.

So do we l=
abel the file what they are saying or just mark it with a 

number and keep=
 track in a log file what that Number file says.??

I do like the idea of  =
not labeling the file what it is saying to see if 

they come up with what =
i think i hear.

But then again some times I'm tired and knowing what the f=
ile says when 

I'm listening to it from some one else does help.

Earl..
