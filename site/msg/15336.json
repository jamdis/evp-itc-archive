I know i have tried to hack the new style 470 (black) as well as Mike Colletta with no success.  The only person that would probably be able to do anything with that is frank as a tuner possibly in a box.  So, if you end up with one and can&#39;t get it to work; frank does accept donations of radios and parts.  Although, he has been using homemade tuners lately that seem to have clearer sounding audio.\n\n-Steve H.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ejspinn&quot; &lt;ejspinn@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks Steve, that is what i was looking for.  Very nice site too.  I think I been on there before but i don&#39;t remember the step-by step for the 587.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had the 470 model ordered from my local radioshack.  They said it was their last one in inventory in the entire district.  That was on June10th.  I called today (july 10th) and the salesman said it was the black one with the green circle like the 469.  I have seen it as low as $9.99 marked as clearance/discontinued.  Have you tried hacking that one yet?\n&gt; \n&gt; I like the idea of the built in speaker like the older 470 (white and grey one) and the most recent one you hacked has a built in speaker too!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again.\n&gt;"}
