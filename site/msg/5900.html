Bruce   The 470 quality is unbelievably clear....especially when Lisa says NOT THE SUN BRUCE.  I don't get phone calls out of Mexico that clear.  I am set to go to the U.S. in three weeks.  Think I will buy a 470 to use with my antenna booster that is coming next week.
   
  I liked the subjects you were asking about.  Have you had any answers in the past about the supposed coming Kill Shot?  Ron L
