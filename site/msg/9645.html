&gt; So here&#x27;s my run-down of responses for the past week ;-):
&gt; 
&gt; Frank S: Congrats on franken out the 469 to your liking!
&gt; 
&gt; I did hear most of everyone&#x27;s files posted:  Urkle and Bruce&#x27;s wer
&gt; most clear.
&gt; 
&gt; KATHYWEIR:  Audacity is free - google it.
&gt; 
&gt; NATHAN:  Whatever you believe is okay.  Opinions make the world go
&gt; round.  If you are open and want to learn more than welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; JULI - WHATS UP GIRL!!!  I have been hanging upside down - out my
&gt; window and about to throw up a ladder and sit on my roof to get better
&gt; reception!!!  I have run out of tinfoil... can you spare some?
&gt; 
&gt; AL from o&#x27;BAMA:  I too always get contradicting answers.  Just
&gt; yesterday I was cleaning my pool and listening to my 470 and I heard
&gt; them say &quot;SHE&#x27;S USING US FOR ENTERTAINMENT&quot;  I replied that I was
&gt; trying to get experience &#x27;hearing&#x27;.  I heard THAT&#x27;S GOOD&quot; and I also
&gt; heard &quot;BITCH LEAVE&quot;.  I apologized if they felt I was intruding and
&gt; asked if they wanted me to shut down or just the DH&#x27;s wanted me too. 
&gt; I heard &quot;BOTH&quot; and I heard &quot;NO DON&#x27;T&quot;.  Who do I choose to listen to?
&gt;  I stayed on for a bit longer - I always err on the side of positive.
&gt;  If I&#x27;m looking for answers to important personal stuff.. I wouldn&#x27;t
&gt; ask the box for answers.  PS:  I once asked if they could read my mind
&gt; and they responded with &quot;OF COURSE NOT&quot; and then proceeded to answer
&gt; my next question before I asked!  Go figure :-)
&gt; 
&gt; RHONDA - Are you hearing voice girl???  I knew it!  You&#x27;re as crazy as
&gt; me!!!  LOL...  I think that&#x27;s cool.
&gt; 
&gt; REES:  I really do believe your lost session was very cool.  I don&#x27;t
&gt; believe it&#x27;s loss was a coincidence.  
&gt; 
&gt; BRUCE:  Cool pictures in the Photos Section.  Have you ever thought
&gt; about doing a BOX session and a Photo session at the same time and see
&gt; if you could get a photograph of the person talking??  That would be
&gt; an interesting experiement.
&gt; 
&gt; MARGARET:  Your knowledge is so emense!  I am grateful you are here
&gt; with us to share.  
&gt; 
&gt; ANNETTE:  Congrats on your son&#x27;s wedding!
&gt; 
&gt; JOEL:  The news item you posted is disturbing on so many levels.  I
&gt; just pray that the universe works it out so that karma is indeed
&gt; something that these people will have to deal with.  Nothing is sacred
&gt; anymore it seems...
&gt; 
&gt; AARON:  C O N G R A T U L A T I O N S !!  On your first successful
&gt; session.  You&#x27;re hooked and welcome aboard the crazy train ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; VINNIE:  CONGRATS TO YOU TOO!  Do you want us to call your Dave or
&gt; Vinnie?  
&gt; 
&gt; RON L:  I asked about Austism for you and I heard :&quot;MAN MADE&quot; and when
&gt; I asked about vaacines I heard &quot;YES..&quot;  I will work on trying to get
&gt; these files online.  But I have so much to go through...  I think I
&gt; will be listening for about a week...  
&gt; 
&gt; whew... i missed you all..
