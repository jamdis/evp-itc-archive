My youngest dachshund is named Lily Dale and  \nshe was just a puppy when I was talking to the so called &quot;Fish Group&quot;.  \nThey LOVED her. I would crate her at night in my bedroom and we could  \nhear &quot;them&quot; talking to her. They&#39;d also rustle the newspapers in the  \nvery large crate I had down. She&#39;d look at the direction of the  \nvoices, but I could tell she couldn&#39;t see anything and was very  \nconfused. I always wondered if her name had something to do with it.  \nOr that she was a puppy. They didn&#39;t speak to my other 2 as far as I  \nknow.\n\nI&#39;m glad they were nice to her and genuinely seemed to like talking to  \nher. Weird, huh?\n\nw."}
