They have been coming thru quite loud and often the clarity is remarkable for me. \n\nMost of these EVP are in the -74 speed range. Well beyond the natural ability of a human voice. (For the newbies, try recording your voice then slow it down to -74 in audacity and you will see what I mean)\n\nhttp://www.esnips.com/web/WaterEVP\n\nAttaching one here for those who get the daily emails =)\n\nMisty\n\n\n      \r\n--0-2113476907-1227111523=:14573\r\nContent-Type: audio/mpeg; name=&quot;111808h2o_CLR-iseethat.mp3&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;111808h2o_CLR-iseethat.mp3&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--0-2113476907-1227111523=:14573--"}
