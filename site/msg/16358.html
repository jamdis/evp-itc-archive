<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bro, I am a newb. I have an interest in learning as much as I can, so I&#x27;ve been pouring over the stuff, but it&#x27;s a lot like Greek. Compared to the circuits I deal with in the security business, these circuits are far more advanced. Some of it seems to require an oscilloscope to tune certain parts and soldering at this magnification could get interesting in a toasty kind of way. But I&#x27;m game. 

I was actually looking at an electronics parts catalog for AM tuners but I think the politically correct/green thing to do is recycle some older stuff. So I&#x27;m going to get a pile together and then hope to identify and acquire the needed parts.

Thank you for the info and please look for my post in the next day or two. I may need help identifying the needed parts. Slowly but surely, I&#x27;ll get the hang of it or fry myself first.

Thanks,

Mark</pre>
