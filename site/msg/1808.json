Voice \nquality, and consistency on linear is so much better than anything I ever \ngot with the RVG. Leaving out the RVG will almost cut board size in half. \nThe actual voice starts 4 seconds in.  Of course, it may not be so good for \nuser(s) that want to interpret what comes through, for, lets say an \naudience?\n\nFrank-S\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMessenger Caf� � open for fun 24/7.
