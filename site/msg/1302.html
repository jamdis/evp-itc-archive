There ya go I couldnt have said it better myself! When Frank is done resting perhaps you could work with him on the schematics part.. help him hit those areas he missed etcetera so he can share it the way he wants to. 

  I'd do it but Im not technical enough to even try to help LOL at least not in that way.
   
  Theres more stuff out there hes posted on his esnips folder, in caches of his old site, probably on my harddrive since I save everything whether I ever use it or not. And there will be more to come hes always updating and sharing perhaps the right people just arent around to ask the right questions or perhaps they are ya'll can check the archives usually for some techinical word such as echo chamber, box, those part numbers he's mentioned. Alot of times people talk about it in posts rather than in file section.

has left out some details (like size/composition of the "echo 
chamber", etc.) and most of the schematics are hard to read due to 
digitizing (resolution) problems.

The key component that can be difficult to find is the Sanyo LA1135 
AM Tuner IC that's at the heart of the system. Frank has apparently 
scrounged this chip from old car radios.

Here's how it operates:

The RVG (Random Voltage Generator) output is fed to the "tuning" 
input of the LA1135 AM radio receiver. What this basically does is 
similar to a human being rapidly and randomly hitting the tuning 
station buttons in a car radio or varying the tuning dial of a 
stationary or portable radio. The output of this randomly-tuned AM 
radio is then fed to a small speaker into an internal "echo chamber" 
(although his box also provides an output jack for an external 
speaker to use an external "echo chamber" or even just the room) 
which also contains a small electret microphone (these are the types 
that a very tiny and can be clipped to your lapel, tie, etc.). The 
output of this mike is then fed to another speaker (or optionally to 
headphones) for the output. Where the "entities" interact with the 
box is in this "echo chamber" (probably just a small, soundproof 
plastic box) using the speech snippets from the randomly-tuned AM 
radio stations as a carrier for any EVP.

Hope this helps everyone!

Guy
