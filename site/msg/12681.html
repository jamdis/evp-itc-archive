Yes I have experience with Dr. Rorke. He is coming at it from a scientific
POV. His stance is based on the lack of scientific evidence, controlled
experiments and claims that can easily be duplicated. This is why ITC is
scoffed by the scientific community. Making extraordinary claims without
scientific evidence to back it up makes every EVP researcher look like a
cool aid drinker. Mr. Moon originally indicated that only a magic thirty
people could make the device work, which would suggest selective physics.
Physics works the same for everyone, and any real proof must have scientific
principles backing it up.
 
He is open to there being something to it. It just hasn't stood up yet to
serious scientific scrutiny. So far it has failed at every turn. Spiricom
was a fraud. The interesting part of the story is why it was a fraud. It
reveals things about the individuals psychology that gives a great deal of
insight about perceptions and ego. We want to believe it works, and often
times it makes us fall victim to pareidolia. Case in point. Take a recording
of a voice produced by any one of these devices. Play it in isolation to
five people. Have them write down what they hear. If they all hear the same
thing alone, then there is something to it. If they all hear something
different, it is Gaussian noise and pareidolia, a well documented effect.
 
This is why serious, disciplined research is tantamount to this part of the
field ever being taken seriously.
