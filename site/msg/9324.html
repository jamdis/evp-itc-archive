&gt; I lost the website that I can buy a Mini Boxe from Ron.  Will somebody post it in the 
forum for me? 
&gt;    
&gt;   Thanks

&gt;           I&#x27;m already so pleased with the research results I obtain that
&gt; anything better from box 31 will be extra whipped cream and cherries
&gt; on top of my enormous vat of ice cream. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am curious to see how the mini and Frank&#x27;s compare. I feel that the
&gt; my minibox is a bit like a TARDIS in a way--I hate to say it has
&gt; bonded with me or imprinted on me (or I&#x27;ve imprinted on it), but that
&gt; does seem to describe it. The entities operating through it have bent
&gt; their communication style to my circumstances. I will be curious to
&gt; see if 31 does something similar. Who knows? It may decide it likes my
&gt; son Nick over me, or my friend Julie.
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever happens, I shall enjoy the experience!

&gt; &gt; Congrats Ladies! I wish you both the very best of luck and success!
&gt; I can only tell you that I love my Franks Box for there is nothing
&gt; like it in the world!

&gt; &gt; Well, we&#x27;ll see if number 31 can hold a candle to mini
&gt; 114. ;) Frank says that 31 is about the size of a mini, and that&#x27;s
&gt; good, because I haven&#x27;t got a lot of space to experiment in. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We&#x27;re all quite excited here--my son, Julie Stoddard, and I. And
&gt; of course, I am really happy that Frank has vetted and approved me to
&gt; adopt one of his babies. (I think the Purples made him do it; they&#x27;ve
&gt; always been sweet on me, right from the start. ;) )
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks for always cheering me on, Bruce. You&#x27;re the toppermost.
