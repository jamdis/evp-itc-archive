<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am very intrigued at this idea, it seems to me that when using evp 
maker in this way it would be easier to detect if the allophone file 
has been manipulated to produce speech than with the shack box. 
Problem I am having (mental block)is that I discard any speech from 
the box that isn&#x27;t directly related to my questions as just part of 
the sweep and not part of the communication. I should probably relax 
and not try so hard, but...

I am curious as to if any one has any special practices or tricks with 
this method that produces great results for them I eventually want to 
make a speakjet box (or more accurately beg my more electronically 
astute friends to build me one).

I have been really enjoying the 469 shack hack method, and of the only 
two sessions I have done, one was uncannily accurate, while the other, 
well it was good experience :D

Thanks in advance for the info...

Andy</pre>
