The \n&gt; &gt; amplified speakers are from OEM Electronics here in town.  They \nhave \n&gt; &gt; tons of used parts, of all sorts.  It&#39;s a place the size of a \ngrocery \n&gt; &gt; store with aisles and aisles of used electronics stuff. Sets of \nused \n&gt; &gt; speakers go for around $10.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Mike\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;judy_in_hollywood&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;Ticket_to_Heaven@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In \n&gt; Hi Mike,  Can you give me/us the make & parts # of the mixer & \nspeakers, so I can try to locate the same items online somewhere???  \nThanks.  =Judy=    --------------------------------\n                                             EVP-\nITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;michaelcoletta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Okay...

Hi Mike!  Wow! I really like \nthe \n&gt; &gt; 2 speakers & the small mixer you show on your photo!!  Where did \nyou \n&gt; &gt; get/find the mixer (for $8) and the 2 speakers (how much)???  I \nhave \n&gt; &gt; a RS 12-469 that I hacked. I have &quot;El Cheap-o&quot; $1. dual speakers, \nbut \n&gt; &gt; I have to put the dynamic mic right next to them + put the RS \nHack \n&gt; &gt; volume to max, to record! Not the greatest, but it works. Let \nme/us \n&gt; &gt; know, thanks!!   8-))  =Judy=\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
