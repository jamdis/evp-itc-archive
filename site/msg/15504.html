What they are asking you for is a simple blessing, or say the two words  
"Our Father" that should help them to open the white light portal and help to  
cross them over.  You guide may be Princess Kira, I would bet she lived one 
 time, you could do a search for her, or you might ask my guide Lydia to 
help you  identify her for you.  Lydia recently came through for me over the  
radio(box), and she even responded to Sharon over her box, Sharon was really 
 surprised I guess, I could hear Lydia say, after Sharon asked for her, my 
Lydia  said "if your good" in other words, Sharon must get naughty 
sometimes, so Lydia  wanted her to be good, then she would come through.  The last 
time I heard  Lydia's voice was back in 1974 I am so happy to hear from her 
again.   Purple is also the color of my main guide's robes, she lived long, 
long ago, she  came from what is now Turkey, she was a rich well to do 
business lady in her  day, and made and sold purple garment's  to the rich, she 
always wears  purple robes herself, and is known as the purple lady, she was/is 
a healer, and  she and her entire household became Christian, she used to 
allow Peter and Paul  and other's to hold secret meetings at her home when 
they were in her  area.  She got the purple dye from shell fishes off the 
Mediterranean  sea coasts, had vats of purple dye, and produced the purple color 
in  clothing.  She recently came through for me, she comes from the highest 
 Heaven, I knew her voice right away, so I know this is real.  Here are a  
couple of her recordings of Lydia, she is my "main control," guide and has 
been  with me all my life, and came up with a few of my ancestors as well.   
Bonnie
In the first one Sharon is asking at my request for Lydia to come forward,  
she says her name loud and clear, then I ask her to give me her identifying 
 color, she says, "purple."  I don't know what type of box Sharon was 
using,  but rest assured it was not a radio, must have been a Franks or a Joe's  
model.  She does come through on my little radio sometimes, but she is very  
busy, and had to come a long way into this heavy atmosphere, she is always  
working over there, nice lady, and I am blessed to have her as my main 
guide.In  this last one with Sharon, Lydia has someone say for her, "be good and 
we will"  for her to come through, and speak to Sharon as Sharon asked her 
to come through  for me <g> and she did.  One of these days, I will buy a 
radio from  you when i get some extra cash, I think that if you use silver for 
the wires you  may get better contact, but i could be wrong, what do i 
know?  Bonnie

I try to stay as far away from religion as possible, it just doesn't make

 stuff they tell me about. They call me purple, and that's a catholic 
thing.  Catholic it the only religion they mention. 'course they also call me a 
girl!  Purple Princess Kiera, it's pronounced a little different than  Kira.

the different boxes give different results for me, and whether  it's
