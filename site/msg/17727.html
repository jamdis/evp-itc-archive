<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I am amazed at how good this sounds. It looks similar to the old GE Super
Radio, except that was an analog radio. This one has the advantage of adding
an external antenna via screw terminals on the back. Plus it&#x27;s AC or
DC(plug-in or batteries), this test is on AC power, I didn&#x27;t have any D
batteries, but I did have the power cord.

 In the garage FM at 7 seconds &quot;Steve&#x27;s&quot;, in garage AM, after 10 seconds
they&#x27;re talking about signals, at 11-12 seconds &quot;you can&#x27;t get the signal&quot;

 This is when it gets fun!!
