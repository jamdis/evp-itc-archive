<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>So, what&#x27;s up with the frequency 1485 kHz? I&#x27;ve already mentioned 
that I&#x27;m reading the book, &#x27;Voice Transmissions With The Deceased&#x27;, 
by Friedrich Jrgenson. He discovered he could receive EVPs in the 
late 1950s during a recording session where he was capturing bird 
calls. 

In the spring of 1960 one of the voices he captured on tape told 
Jurgenson to &quot;use the radio&quot; as a medium. After that, he used this 
radio technique until his death. He connected a microphone and a 
radio receiver to the tape recorder and in this way he could have a 
real-time conversation with his &quot;friends&quot;, as he called them. 

Usually he would set the radio for reception at frequencies where 
there is generally a variation of noises coming through. Later, he 
maintained the receiving frequencies to around 1445-1500 kHz. 1485.0 
kHz has been labelled the Jrgenson Frequency. 

Another very interesting tidbit is; In 1978 Jurgenson held a press 
conference and a number of lectures for groups. It was then that he 
predicted that we would soon be able to receive messages through 
television as well. He labeled the work &quot;Audioscopic Research.&quot; 

As you can see today, many use this form of ITC in an attempt to 
receive images of entities or spirits on a monitor or television set. 
There have even been a number of movies about this form of spirit 
communication.
