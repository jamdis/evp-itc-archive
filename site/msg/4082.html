Zack, I know what you mean about not being able to control it, etc.  That's=
 
why I got into remote viewing - it gave me a vehicle for understanding, 
=
expression, & control without all the noise.

Thanx Mike, I do feel welcome=
 :-)

  I've been interested for many yea=
rs in a lot of the stuff that takes 
  place outside the ham bands. Spy num=
bers stations, long delayed 
  echoes, utilitiy transmissions, oddidites, p=
irate shortwave radio, 
  over-the-horizon-radar and many other things. A l=
ot of ham operators 
  don't seem to be too interested in these things.

I have thought sometimes that I was a "sensitive" but it's not something I =

  can control and it comes and goes with no apparent pattern.
