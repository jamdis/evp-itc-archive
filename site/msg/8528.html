<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce.  The reason I asked about the techs is, my normal guys are David &amp; Patrick, and 
a woman whose name I&#x27;ve never been told.  They come through on the MiniBox or manual 
radio sweep.  It seems I have a different tech group (five people) when I work with more 
traditional EVP methods, which I discovered nearly three years ago.   

I thought it interesting to have someone named Arthur come through via EVPM, as the 
name is new to me.  I&#x27;ve long suspected that perhaps different groups assist with different 
technologies.  For instance, I have one team that seems to be unique to my work with light 
(phototransistor modified recorder and battery operated plasma globe combo.)

I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by &quot;come up with the answer, backed up by a file.&quot;

&gt; Margaret,
&gt;  
&gt; I have had the same two techs since I began this research.
&gt; Mike and Lisa, we built a very strong and trusting relationship.
&gt; Within about the last month I have hardly heard from mike and received 
&gt; numerous message that lead ME to believe he has moved on, either to
&gt; help less experienced researchers or to a higher spiritual level.
&gt;  
&gt; There is definitely a restructuring of the techs and guides going on.
&gt; I am not the only researcher experiencing this phenomenon.
&gt;  
&gt; I still however receive messages from Lisa in every box session.
&gt; To answer your original question, given the fact that I have only done 2 EVPM sessions 
&gt; No I have not received any conformation of either of my techs, and of course with the 
&gt; nature of the robotic sound that the EVPM file omits, Recognisable voice tones or 
patterns
&gt; are not possible.
&gt;  
&gt; But the experiments continue, and hopefully one of us will come up with the answer, 
backed
&gt; up by a file.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi All. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else has received a &#x27;tech&#x27; or &#x27;helper&#x27; name(s) while using 
EVP Maker?Just thought I&#x27;d toss this out there.... Last night I asked who was speaking 
using the EVP Maker and SJ Allophones combo, and received the direct answer, &quot;Arthur.&quot; 
That&#x27;s a bit short for my preference, as I like to rule out coincidence, but there was a 
followup statement made in the same session which surprised me, &quot;Arthur can help you.&quot; I 
think when using sweep and similar techniques that relevance to session content is really 
important as an aid in ruling our false positives, so this followup comment helped sway 
me toward the possibility of this having been intentional communication. It&#x27;s been 
fascinating to work with this combination the last couple of days!Margaret
