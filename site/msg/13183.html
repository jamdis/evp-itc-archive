RJ it wasn't personal... I just could tell it could go that way.....
Just f=
rom reading your emails and Mike's.....
Alot of us take what we do personal=
 ( it's like our baby ) 
Don't get upset with me RJ, okay. I have just seen=
 arguments start 
in this ITC group before, and I don't like it....that doe=
sn't find
answers.....
I shouldn't have interferred. I just thought that I =
saw the possibility
for one growing.
Any help that you can give us is appre=
ciated.....

Deb - I hope you didn't read anyth=
ing personal into any of this.
I am only addressing the process and methodo=
logies presented.
In this case, it is the process being used during analysi=
s. 

Maybe you could expand on where you felt my comments crossed the line
=
into something personal?

I am going to conduct a little experiment, if you al=
l don't mind.
I will give these instructions to several people.  I encourag=
e those
here to try it too.

Listen to the 3rd video on that page. 
http://=
www.youtube. com/watch? v=3D8nm3EhR9PTc&eurl=3Dhttp:// www.ufogeek.
com/vft=
se. htm

Listen especially from 4:00 to 4:10
But do not go past 4:10, becau=
se then he says what he thinks it is
saying.

Tell me what you think, if an=
ything, the words in 4:00-4:10 are saying,
before you have gone past 4:10 a=
nd heard what the person on the audio
then says he thinks he hears.

Thanks for posting.    I am going through them now.

Could you explain =
more what you meant when you said you ran the audio
file through an algorit=

software/function do you re=
