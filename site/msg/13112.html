The place where the interference was most noticeable was at ft mifflin - n=
ear the philly airport.

I don't really understand radio theory or any of t=
hat stuff, but I wondered if that (proximity to the airport) had anything t=
o do with it.

I have also noticed in certain areas a huge increase in inte=
rference at night compared to during the day i the same location.

Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Of Radio Interference and equipment...











Well I =
was simplifying but most broadcast antennas are setup for very little radia=
tion directly below as well as above as it is a waste of power.  AM *loves*=
 to shoot straight up because of the bounce (as you HAM guys know) but TV a=
nd FM wants as much power as possible to be at the top for the farthest lin=
e of sight broadcast.

I was amazed to read that you guys got FM chatter on=
 the recorder.  I guess it is possible in theory but I would never had expe=
cted that.  Just goes to show why it is all radio theory and not radio proo=
f or law :))  Those EM fields are tricky little buggers.

That's only true of a simple dipole. Antennas can be engineered to=
 get 
practically any pattern you want. In fact, many FM and TV antennas ha=
ve a 
pattern which peaks from directly below the antenna to the horizon an=
d 
sends very little signal straight up.

Also, close-in you might still be=
 in the Fresnel zone of the field.
