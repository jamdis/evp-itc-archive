&gt;  Got letter(e-mail) from a world renowned EVP authority( name withheld cuz
&gt; I know the threats that would come), explaining how they tested the boxes
&gt; and found nothing to it, y&#x27;all just silly uninformed masses that don&#x27;t know
&gt; any better and they&#x27;ll tell us all what&#x27;s ok to hear and believe in!
&gt; Thousands of box users and experiencers are either lying or insane!
&gt;
&gt;  Pseudo scientific BS! Their testing reveals exactly what they expectt,
&gt; that is the nature of the paranormal. Getting the results they wanted, they
&gt; puff out their chests and proclaim yet another victory for science!
&gt; Science has a habit of supplying exactly the results wanted by whoever is
&gt; paying for the tests..
&gt;
&gt;  First, where do they find people that are somehow qualified listeners!?
&gt; WTF is that S---!? It&#x27;s BS, and they know it. Same old skeptic/science crap,
&gt; except from a group that wants to be the worlds onlyest EVP authority.
&gt;
&gt;  I&#x27;m sure there will be articles in major paranormal mags proclaiming how
&gt; the experts thoroughly debunked the boxes.
&gt;
&gt;  They keep testing and getting nothing, and the rest of us keep recording
&gt; and have no shortage of voices that others can hear, can be validated, and
&gt; gives infromation that&#x27;s unknow to the listener. I just posted a video where
&gt; a voice says &quot;I said fuck&quot; just to show it&#x27;s not broadcast frags. This stuff
&gt; conveniently ignored.  I&#x27;ve been kicked off groups for getting voices thast
&gt; somehow were judged not ghostly enough, cuz all the experts know ghosts
&gt; can&#x27;t cuss, they can barely even talk and communcate!
&gt;
&gt;  They send me their stupid results thinking I&#x27;m the one out there pushing
&gt; boxes. Ignorant dorks, it&#x27;s the results pushing boxes!
