An audio file is just a =\r\nfile of bytes, that is later interpreted by an audio player.

After a lengthy discour=\r\nse with another member here, I learned that I was wrong. The reason why I d=\r\nid not realize it in the first place is that when I would email a wav file,=\r\n I would intentionally keep it in very small segments, to keep file size do=\r\nwn. This was just for ease of transfer. But because of this, I had not expe=\r\nrienced any noticeable loss.\n\n                              Now it may be i=\r\nn some cases, depending on the servers or what have you that the file goes =\r\nthrough, that the loss may be less or more. But once the attachment is down=\r\nloaded, the quality has been found to be less then the original wav.\n\n     =\r\n                         Again though you can only really tell when the wav=\r\n file is large.\n\n                              ----- Original Message -----=\r\n \n                                From: Rj \n                               =\r\n To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com \n                                Sent: Sunday=\r\n, May 10, 2009 1:36 PM\n                                Subject: Re: [EVP-IT=\r\nC] File uploading rules\n\n\n                                The kind of compr=\r\nession that occurs during an email attachment is &quot;lossless&quot;: it compress th=\r\ne file cleverly without losing information.  For example, if I had a progra=\r\nm in some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it could compress it.  But =\r\nif it lost even one bit, the resulting exe file would not execute again aft=\r\ner it was uncompressed on the other side.\n\n                                =\r\nThis kind of compression does things like looking for common patterns in th=\r\ne file, and replacing them with a token.  A rough example would be if it fo=\r\nund &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot; in a file 20 times, it could replace all the occurance=\r\ns with say $HN1.  And also write a little dictionary in there someplace tha=\r\nt says &quot;$HN1=3DHowdy Neighbor&quot;.\n\n                                When the f=\r\nile gets to its destination it can be uncompressed, and all occurences of $=\r\nHN1 are replaced with &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot;.  So it was compressed (instead of 1=\r\n4 characters each, it only needed 4, plus the dictionary), but lost no data=\r\n.\n\n                                Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not=\r\n lossless.  Depending on the level of compression, some level of data is lo=\r\nst, and so cannot be recovered or reconstructed later.\n\n                   =\r\n             Rick\n\n\n\n                                --- On Sun, 5/10/09, A=\r\npril Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n          =\r\n                      From: April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresea=\r\nrch. com&gt;\n                                Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] File uploa=\r\nding rules\n                                To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n   =\r\n                             Date: Sunday, May 10, 2009, 10:26 AM\n\n\n\n      =\r\n                          Another thing:\n\n                                I=\r\n recently found this out. When you email a file, if it is not saved as a co=\r\nmpressed format, the email filtering process will actually compress the fil=\r\ne automatically.\n\n                                So even if you have attac=\r\nhed a wav. file, it will loose resolution over the email process. It will n=\r\not sound exactly the same as the original wav. file. How much it differs de=\r\npends on the size of the file you are attaching. If it is a very large file=\r\n, it will sound much different.\n\n                                The only e=\r\nxception to this is if the wav. file is small enough that the filtering pro=\r\ncess will ignore it.

Imagine taking a picture of a field of flowers, and beginnin=\r\ng to add levels or pixelization to the picture.  Soon, you would not be abl=\r\ne to tell there were flowers there at all.  You would see a lot of colored =\r\nblocks.\n\n                                Or in the other direction, imagine=\r\n you are looking at a competely randomize bunch of pixes on your screen: a =\r\ncomplete screen of truely random static snow.  Pixelizing this, after a whi=\r\nle, you would again start to see colored blocks.\n\n                         =\r\n       What&#39;s happening is that it is processing an area of the image, taki=\r\nng (for instance) the average value of that entire area, and replacing all =\r\nthe blocks in that area with the average.  In video processing, this would =\r\nresult in a field of multi-colored flowers being replaced by, for instance,=\r\n a big greyish-bluish block, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the noise =\r\nexample, it maybe replace all the random pixels with another big greyish-bl=\r\nuish block.  If you did not know beforehand what the original picture was, =\r\nyou couldn&#39;t tell whether your pixelized image was really a field of flower=\r\ns, a chevy, the sky with clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.\n\n            =\r\n                    It works the same with the sound files.

For example, if I had a \n    =\r\n                            program in some .exe files, and I sent it over =\r\n\n                                email, it could compress it.&nbsp; But if =\r\nit \n                                lost even one bit, the resulting exe fi=\r\nle would \n                                not execute again after it was un=\r\ncompressed on \n                                the other side.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This =\r\nkind of compression \n                                does things like looki=\r\nng for common patterns in \n                                the file, and re=\r\nplacing them with a token.&nbsp; \n                                A rough e=\r\nxample would be if it found &quot;Howdy \n                                Neighbo=\r\nr&quot; in a file 20 times, it could replace \n                                al=\r\nl the occurances with say $HN1.&nbsp; And also \n                           =\r\n     write a little dictionary in there someplace \n                        =\r\n        that says &quot;$HN1=3DHowdy Neighbor&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When the \n               =\r\n                 file gets to its destination it can be \n                  =\r\n              uncompressed, and all occurences of $HN1 are \n               =\r\n                 replaced with &quot;Howdy Neighbor&quot;.&nbsp;
