<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I still hear &quot;Seven Bruce&quot; and &quot;Yeah, but who&#x27;s counting&quot;.  This one 
is a judgement call for each person.  Remember 10 people can hear 10 
different things.  That&#x27;s why there are no experts in this field, 
lack of proof of anything.  Just different interpretations we want 
others to believe.  We can only put out there what we hear and let 
everybody judge for themselves.
