&gt;  Well it could be multiple spirits or just one spirit using different
&gt; fragments of speech making you think there are multiple entities.
&gt;
&gt; Or it could be multiple entities like in the movie Ghost when Whoopie
&gt; Goldberg was doing a reading with Orlando&#x27;s wife to get messages from
&gt; Orlando, and she was surrounded by multiple entities talking at the same
&gt; time.
&gt;
&gt; I do a lot of recordings for clients, and I have gotten multiple voices in
&gt; just about every recording, and often times get lets say a five word
&gt; sentence with each word a different sounding voice.
&gt;
&gt; First time clients expect to hear the voice of their loved one exactly as
&gt; when they were alive, but that rarely occurs, and in truth almost never.
&gt;
&gt; When I record with my dad, I get male, female, young, old, animated, peter
&gt; framption messages in music from him, and he talks in these many different
&gt; voices about my family mentioning their first names in discussion.
&gt;
&gt; I still do not understand how those messages magically appear, or even if
&gt; they are from one entity or many others having side conversations while I
&gt; record with one deceased client.
&gt;
&gt; Heck the dead for all we know, while they talk to us, some guide could be
&gt; typing what they said into a etherical machine that projects the words into
&gt; the noise of the radio scanning for our recorders to pick up.
&gt;
&gt; Before I start a session, I always ask if there are other entities present
&gt; that they please do not speak or even have a side conversation while they
&gt; watch as their conversation can get picked up on my recorder in addition to
&gt; the client entity I am recording with.
&gt;
&gt; I guess when I did, I will find the answer to that question.

&gt; Frank,
&gt;
&gt; I listened closely to the clips and I found only one to contain continuous
&gt; conversation between voices. I am continually amazed that you receive
&gt; multiple voices in conversation. It never seems to be just one person
&gt; speaking in your clips (from the ones I&#x27;ve heard anyway).
&gt;
&gt; There are typically two or more voices in conversation with one another,
&gt; which, as you know, should not be possible because of the rapid switching of
&gt; frequencies. But yet, these voices carry over all the switching. That should
&gt; be proof enough for people.
&gt;
&gt; By any chance do you know the amount of time your box stays on one
&gt; frequency before switching? Is this time different between random and sweep?
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, to my ears, the best clip of these was the one labeled 0609101820.
&gt; The voices in this clip were quite clear.
&gt;
&gt; @.01: Go Back (male)
&gt; @.02: It&#x27;s pretty cool (same male voice)
&gt; @.04: Awesome (female)
&gt; @.06: Hello (different female)
&gt; @.08: Help me (electronic)
&gt; @.09: Hi (same female as before)
&gt; @.10: Help me Help me (same electronic)
&gt; @.12: Help me (same electronic)
&gt; @.13: Help me (same electronic)
&gt; @.14: Help me (same electronic)
&gt;
&gt; Clip 0609102333 had few clear words to be analyzed:
&gt;
&gt; @.02: Hello (male)
&gt; @.03: Who has (?pulled center?) (female)
&gt; @.06: Whatever (same female)
&gt;
&gt; The 0609101257 clip (the one with the scope) was odd. There are vocal
&gt; characteristics present such as pitch and timbre, there are times when it
&gt; even sounds syllabled, but it does not sound like English to me. Could this
&gt; be one of your ET clips?
