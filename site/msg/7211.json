I have the  \n&gt; LA1135 radio wired---already, and ready to start testing Friday \n&gt; night.  There has to be a reason I didn&#39;t use that chip, but the \n&gt; breadboarded  version seemed to work ok, but that was a couple \nyears \n&gt; ago. The goal is to  make sure I have the best possible radio, and \n&gt; audio output, then make more  printed circuit boards. \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In _EVP-ITC@yahoogroupsEVP-_ (mailto:EVP-\nITC@yahoogroups.com) ,  \n&gt; Marlboro63@,  Mar\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you build it they will come  ............\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jeff\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In a message  dated 2/13/2008 10:25:14 A.M.
