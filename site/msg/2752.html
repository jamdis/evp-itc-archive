<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Dave, 
On first listen I&#x27;m hearing &quot;Oh that (or &quot;Oh now&quot;).... this is is 
dead people&quot;. Listened to this in WMP. Then I loaded it into Cool 
Edit and slowed it down a bit but still hearing the same thing. 
Either way, could not discern what was being said immediately before 
&#x27;this is dead people&quot; but this part came in very clearly where even 
if you had not mentioned ahead of time what was being said in that 
section, I too would be saying that this is what&#x27;s being said there. 
What&#x27;s interesting is &#x27;they&#x27; often identify themselves as &#x27;dead 
people&#x27; and I know this because many others have recorded EVP where 
they are saying that too though I myself have never gotten an EVP 
saying that.  
At any rate, I&#x27;ve personally never recorded an EVP or listened to any 
other EVP recorded by others where they are saying that are spirits 
or ghosts, or angels or discarnates in regards to general terms to 
WHAT they are.

&gt; Ann, thanks for listening and your comments. Yeah, some of these 
radio sweeps do have an EVP maker sound about them. I use a rapid 
linear scanning rate and have had good results using the FM band. 
Here&#x27;s another slowed 20 per cent.
&gt; &quot;Oh that is stupid...This is dead people&quot;

&gt; 
&gt; I hear that clearly.
&gt; 
&gt; It does seem to be working rather like EVP Maker. Too bad that 
darned  
&gt; program was never modified for Macs. I always wanted to try it.

&gt; &gt; This one is at a slightly slower scan rate.

&gt; &gt; Thanks Frank. I keep the scanning rate fairly high. This was the  
&gt; &gt; longest message in a single &#x27;voice&#x27;. Rather choppy sounding.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &quot;It rotates infinitesimal to the Universe&quot;

&gt; &gt; Yeah, I can hear that, it&#x27;s alot like EVPmaker.

&gt; &gt; Super Radio! That&#x27;s sacred! Just kidding---sorta. Anyway the 
voice  
&gt; &gt; is pretty clear--good job!I think the chip I&#x27;m using has built 
in  
&gt; &gt; AFC, and no way to disable it, so FM scannning doesn&#x27;t sound too  
&gt; &gt; good, but AM makes up for it.Frank-
