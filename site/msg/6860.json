Since doing the research, have you noticed an increase\nin your &quot;intuitive&quot; senses?  By that I mean, has your hearing been\nheightened to the point of hearing conversations when you are alone? \nOr seeing things more clearly spirit wise?  Or am I just nuts and need\nto be committed?  \n\nI had to ask.  It&#39;s a very strange thing.  These things have been\nhappening to me and I&#39;m wondering if you have experienced the same\nthing or close to it.\n\nJeremy"}
