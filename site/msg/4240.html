<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, buddy, I&#x27;m glad to hear that the Purples made their point of  
view clear. ;)

You and I go back all the way to the AA-EVP list and I always have  
counted you as someone who told the truth, no matter how  
uncomfortable it was. You do the right thing as often as you can.  
I&#x27;ve seen you struggle over the years, and you always choose the path  
that harms no one and brings you no fame or fortune. Good on you, I  
say, and more of it.

We&#x27;re here because we respect you, Frank, and because you provide an  
honest forum for this research. We&#x27;re not leaving. Just try and make  
us. ;)

&gt;  Well, when ya get someone giving seemingly valid reasons why these  
&gt; new methods are invalid, or questionable, then I turn on the RS  
&gt; hack rig, and &quot;they&quot; are singing &quot;Purple&quot; across the band, and then  
&gt; the scan starts again at the bottom of AM with &quot;DO NOT---QUIT---- 
&gt; GROUP&quot; (the --- indicate gaps with no broadcasts or voice  
&gt; fragments), I&#x27;m supposed to believe that&#x27;s just my imagination,  
&gt; that these things don&#x27;t work. The fact is all these methods work,  
&gt; and they have in fact been used long before the box.
&gt;
&gt;  This &quot;Researcher&quot; I was arguing with yesterday no doubt thought he  
&gt; had me convinced, and on his side. I can&#x27;t go there after I get  
&gt; clear, coherent, meaningful messages with these other methods. I  
&gt; would like to keep the disaggreements friendly, and the discussions  
&gt; friendly, and I do consider the opposing viewpoint, but it just  
&gt; doesn&#x27;t hold water in the case of these alternate radio methods.  
&gt; That&#x27;s why no interviews, and no in person meetings--as such, I can  
&gt; be put into a postion of sympathy with a person when I don&#x27;t  
&gt; actually agree. It&#x27;s called lack of assertiveness, and I did in  
&gt; fact fail assertiveness training in the community college! As soon  
&gt; as the meeting is over though, I&#x27;m going to tell ya to bite me, and  
&gt; do my own thing anyway.
&gt;
&gt;  I think we all have to be very careful when critisizing someone&#x27;s  
&gt; work here, research, or comments--in public. So far very little of  
&gt; the EVP stuff can be considered hard evidence, it&#x27;s all what they  
&gt; call anecdotal, or it&#x27;s what one or more witnesses experienced, but  
&gt; it&#x27;s not repeatable--pretty much. Or you can&#x27;t grab someone off the  
&gt; street, have them listen to voices and expect they&#x27;ll hear it.
&gt;
&gt;  I can&#x27;t say my results are anymore valid than anyone else&#x27;s&#x27; but I  
&gt; also can&#x27;t accpet that anyone else&#x27;s results are more valid than my  
&gt; own. I am an independent researcher, I do this work on my own, it&#x27;s  
&gt; more like just a hobby. I don&#x27;t sell anything, and I make nothing  
&gt; by endorsing other products. When I say the Mini Box works, and the  
&gt; Radio Shack hack works, that is the honest thing to do, it&#x27;s not  
&gt; cuz I get a kick back, as I get nothing in return, except to know I  
&gt; did the right thing.
&gt;
&gt;  As for this other &quot;Researcher&quot;, I don&#x27;t know what to tell ya. I  
&gt; can only ask, give us some friggin&#x27; credit! There&#x27;s some good peole  
&gt; here, and to dismiss us, and all or our results is extremely  
&gt; insulting.
&gt;
&gt;  As for the possiblities of danger with this research, I&#x27;ve been  
&gt; thinking about that. First I don&#x27;t know of anyone else that has had  
&gt; any problems directly related to box use, and or paranormal work  
&gt; fro that matter.  It&#x27;s like listening to some bible thumper  
&gt; swearing the devil is really right there, just waiting to jump down  
&gt; your throat, and yet, there&#x27;s..... nothing. So far it&#x27;s more  
&gt; threatening to cross the street every morning (I usually walk to  
&gt; work).
&gt;
&gt;  I pretty much work by myself, I like it that way, and sharing what  
&gt; I get here. I don&#x27;t wanna be TAPS, or any other thing. I don&#x27;t care  
&gt; who accepts my results, I do this for myself, for my own curiosity.  
&gt; I&#x27;m not going to accept someone else&#x27;s version of reality, and I  
&gt; trust my own intuition.
&gt;
&gt;  I&#x27;m sorry if someone thought I implied this shit came from   
&gt; Edison, or anyone else. I don&#x27;t recall that. It&#x27;s more likely that  
&gt; someone suggested it was Edison&#x27;s concept, or whatever, and I kinda  
&gt; agreed it was like that for discussion--I don&#x27;t know.  I know how  
&gt; it came about in my own mind, as problems are often solved, your  
&gt; own subconcius mind will assemble an answer based on previous  
&gt; experience, and I had worked with voltage tunable radios in the mid  
&gt; 90&#x27;s, then I got interested in EVP, then I used EVPmaker, then my  
&gt; own mind connected all the dots, nothing mysterious, or other  
&gt; worldly about it. It&#x27;s that same process that takes place when you  
&gt; sleep on a problem, and wake up with a solution. I did not  
&gt; understand the process at first, but it&#x27;s very common.
