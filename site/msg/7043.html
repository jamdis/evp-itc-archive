To Everyone,

 

Very good points of view and healthy diversity. I will say, I apologize for
using the term.aheeemm Balls..

But the rest I was trying to say light-hearted, sticking up for us women in
general..

(that's not so bad, now is it?)

But what I meant, in a dry sense of humor way, didn't come across that way
to some, again I apologize.

But, I didn't ban Bruce, I only took away his right to post, anyone remember
seeing the other Mod wanting to ban him? They said I was being too nice.
Does anyone remember that? Also in the message I sent I also praised Bruce,
telling what a great job he's doing or he's so good with what he does,
nobody remembers that? 

Then I get bashed, I mean bashed..my personality, my work, my whatever. Then
someone sticks up for me from the bashing and they got slaughtered, and got
in the crossfire. I am sorry that Bruce is unable to control his bashing,
abusive language, insults remarks and threats to other people's lives. Yes
you heard me. I have the emails to prove it. Now, I am saddened this had to
be done, you may not believe me, but that doesn't matter anymore. I respect
all here. I respect Frank S, and he knows that. 

And I am sorry, that Bruce has to be so abrupt and harsh to fast too. Yes we
can be our own worse judge.

 

Again I apologize..Ann, great story..do I get paid for that part in the
movie?  I was trying to remember the actor that played a similar role in a
movie, with Sharon Stone. ( I'm just joking) but really that was a good
little story that made up there. It was cute. J

Steve,

I certainly respect and support the idea that none of us is a messiah
and none of us has all the answers, but that is not germane to the
issue here. This is about how to correctly and fairly moderate a list.

If this was the wild west, things would have transpired something like
this:

Bruce stood in the public street and offered a completely legitimate
exchange with the townsfolk.

Laura walked out of the saloon and took a shot at Bruce and at the
window of Frank S's telegraph office.

Bruce shot back at Laura.

Johnny Marlboro stepped out onto the balcony of the Imperial hotel and
took a shot a Bruce.

Bruce shot back.

Laura pulled out a deputy's badge, stuck it to her lapel, and shot
Bruce dead.

Ann ran out into the street and said, "Don't you think there's a
problem here? Maybe the sheriff needs to step in," to which Laura,
acting under the color of law, replied that if Ann didn't like it she
could leave town and if she stayed she better not question authority
again. 

That's what happened here. That's the issue.

I'm still standing here saying something is wrong. Shoot me.

Ann

I certainly respect and support the idea that none of us is a messiah<b=

and none of us has all the answers, but that is not germane to the<br>
i=
ssue here. This is about how to correctly and fairly moderate a list.<br>
<=
br>
If this was the wild west, things would have transpired something like<=
br>
this:<br>
<br>
Bruce stood in the public street and offered a completel=
y legitimate<br>
exchange with the townsfolk.<br>
<br>
Laura walked out of =
the saloon and took a shot at Bruce and at the<br>
window of Frank S's tele=
graph office.<br>
<br>
Bruce shot back at Laura.<br>
<br>
Johnny Marlboro s=
tepped out onto the balcony of the Imperial hotel and<br>
took a shot a Bru=
ce.<br>
<br>
Bruce shot back.<br>
<br>
Laura pulled out a deputy's badge, s=
tuck it to her lapel, and shot<br>
Bruce dead.<br>
<br>
Ann ran out into th=
e street and said, "Don't you think there's a<br>
problem here? Maybe =
the sheriff needs to step in," to which Laura,<br>
acting under the co=
lor of law, replied that if Ann didn't like it she<br>
could leave town and=
 if she stayed she better not question authority<br>
again. <br>
<br>
That'=
s what happened here. That's the issue.<br>
<br>
I'm still standing here sa=
ying something is wrong. Shoot me.<br>
