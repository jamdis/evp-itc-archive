<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi everyone, 

I&#x27;m sure lots of you know who James Randi is, the skeptic who offers $1 
million for proof of the paranormal. 

I am wondering why there hasn&#x27;t been an EVP demonstration good enough 
to win the prize. I have never captured an EVP, but many people have 
including those in this group. I cannot say (like James Randi 
apparently and others like him) that I think every person who captured 
an EVP is a fraud or captured a fluke or something like that. I don&#x27;t 
think that at all, it appears to me that many of them are the real 
deal, of that I am almost 100% certain and will be 100% certain if I 
can ever capture my own. 

I don&#x27;t know a lot about James Randi or EVP for that matter, but it is 
a question that came up. Can anyone enlighten me? 

I tried a few sessions last night but came up empty handed. I am 
starting to think my white noise isn&#x27;t loud enough. I&#x27;m going to keep 
trying. 

Also I hope to experiment with ITC images. And soon I want to build 
a &quot;box&quot; which I keep hearing so much about. I don&#x27;t know the first 
thing about these ghost/spirit boxes as I&#x27;ve heard them called, all I 
know is I want to learn to build one and use it as I&#x27;ve heard some 
interesting audio files here. But that&#x27;s probably a good subject for a 
separate post unless anyone can give me an informative how-to link or 
anything. 

Thanks!
Angela</pre>
