That&#39;s AMAZING!!!!Thanks\nDave\nI&#39;d like to know more about him since there are a few folks who paint him in\na bad light from time to time.\n\nOn Sat, Feb 7, 2009 at 12:09 AM, don powell &lt;dpowell7299@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I found the book.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is called &quot;The Diary and Sundry Observations of Thomas Alva Edison&quot;  the\n&gt; copyright for the edition I have is 1948.  Since only a limited number of\n&gt; 1st printings have Chapter 8, &quot;The Realms Beyond&quot;, then I suspect 1948 would\n&gt; be the date of the first printing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Each chapter ends with the year Mr. Edison wrote it (it is primarily his\n&gt; diary).  The part about spirit communication is dated 1922.\n&gt;\n&gt; Obviously a 61 year old book is a bit fragile so I&#39;ll start trying to scan\n&gt; those pages but I&#39;m not going to hurt the book for it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I suppose I just post them as JPGs in an email?  There is not a place to\n&gt; upload files here is there?  Well I know there is but I thought we were not\n&gt; supposed to use it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Don\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Fri, 2/6/09, David Koenig &lt;floridajakeblues@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: David Koenig &lt;floridajakeblues@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: TruTV with the Box\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, February 6, 2009, 10:41 AM\n&gt;\n&gt;  Thanks for the link! Very interesting. I went to Edison&#39;s place down here\n&gt; in Florida in search of any information on the subject.\n&gt; I found nothing. It was rumored that the executors of the estate had\n&gt; anything of the sort removed.\n&gt; I lost both my grandad and an uncle last month. People change their minds\n&gt; about the afterlife. I&#39;ve seen it first hand!\n&gt; How old was Edison when this article was written?\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n&gt; On Fri, Feb 6, 2009 at 11:16 AM, Rj &lt;rasterer@yahoo. com&lt;http://mc/compose?to=rasterer@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   That would be  very useful thing to scan and post those few pages...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- On *Fri, 2/6/09, don powell &lt;dpowell7299@ yahoo.com&lt;http://mc/compose?to=dpowell7299@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;* wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From: don powell &lt;dpowell7299@ yahoo.com&lt;http://mc/compose?to=dpowell7299@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: TruTV with the Box\n&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;http://mc/compose?to=EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Date: Friday, February 6, 2009, 8:07 AM\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have one of a handful of the Edison Autobiography that has the last\n&gt;&gt; chapter with his thoughts on the great beyond.  His family had that version\n&gt;&gt; of the biography recalled and reissued it without the last chapter.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Anyway in this last chapter, Edison alludes to a way to communicate with\n&gt;&gt; the dead but he never says he did it.  He simply hypothesizes on how it\n&gt;&gt; could be done and the fact that the dead are just on a different wavelength\n&gt;&gt; than the living.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, no links...  This is from that old fashioned thing called a book\n&gt;&gt; :))\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I can tell you how to find your own copy though if you wish.  I need to\n&gt;&gt; find the actual page count from my copy but I went to amazon&#39;s used books\n&gt;&gt; and asked every seller how many pages their copy was.  The first one to\n&gt;&gt; respond with the correct (bigger) number, that was the one I bought.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Don\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; PS but don&#39;t spend alot.

Modern researchers in this field will\n&gt;&gt; have to stand on their own results anyway, and if they&#39;ve managed to\n&gt;&gt; discover something that Edison never achieved, good for them!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have also heard varied claims: that Edison did make this box; that\n&gt;&gt; Edison was working on it but never finished it; that Edison was joking\n&gt;&gt; when he mentioned working on it.
