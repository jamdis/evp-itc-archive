Bruce,
I just wanted to drop a line and say =
Amen!   Granted, the electronic element is the 'e' in EVP (and the 'i' in I=
TC), but the most accomplished researchers (including Maggy and Jules, Kons=
tantin and Friedrich, and yes, Mark Macy, insist that if you have the harmo=
ny, love, and RESONANCE among researchers, all the electronic problems can =
be overcome.  
Is anyone involved in the AA-EVP 'Big Circle' group?  I see =
that they attempt contact all at once from their own homes around the count=
ry, I think on Thursday evenings at a set time.
Is anyone interested in thi=
s?  From what I see, and from my own new interest, it seems most of us try =
contacts as much as possible throughout the day.  Anyone want to try a set =
time?
