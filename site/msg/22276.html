All of this is just another example of=C2=A0 how the "spiritually enlighten=

I'm sitting here min=
ding my own business and i'm dragged into yet another negative post.

This =
used to be a great group and an original for this field, about 6 years ago =
before anybody knew about ghost boxes a few of us were here doing our resea=
rch and posting our stuff. 

Just look in the archives to see the activity =
we use to have here. It's true, i do use this group mainly to allow fellow =
enthusiasts to own a decent box at a cheap price. 

There are 900 people he=
re to target, although there never is a post anymore. 

Me and others do al=
l of our posting at my RTSC yahoo group, where i help individuals daily wit=
h advice and links to FREE downloads and ideas to test and try.

Despite wh=
at frank says, i never claimed to invent anything or say he didn't. That al=
l came from his brain and it was all made up.

All i did was add a function=
 generator kit for $10 to a radio to make it sweep. I got the idea from Ric=
h Georgina on my group, that wasn't my idea either.

All these things are a=
ll documented everywhere with me giving all the credit to Bill Chappel, fra=
nk, rich, joe.

Somehow franks lies went mainstream about me. If you don't =
believe what i'm saying, i have all this FREE information documented on my =
site for 6 years now. I have never made any money off of anybody and i offe=
r everything for Free on my site including all the hacks i did and how to m=
ake your own ghost boxes with a sweep circuit. I even have the links on whe=
re to get the parts to build them cheap.

So before you post something else=
 negative, do your homework on who people are and what they have contribute=
d without any fame in mind or monetary motives.
