&gt;    I&#x27;m working with a few really great technical wizards right now and
&gt; we&#x27;ll see what they can do with this software and programs.
&gt;
&gt; Getting images from our audio and employing visual modalities with EVP &amp;
&gt; GBC &quot;seems&quot; like the other half and missing piece to what we do. It makes so
&gt; much sense to me and if it works as suggested will allow our depth of
&gt; communication to extend so much further than it has prior to this...almost
&gt; like a conscious mind (GBC, surface messages) and the subconscious mind
&gt; (sound/audio imaging and everything that lies beneath the surface) sort of
&gt; thing.
&gt;
&gt; I really get a good, STRONG feeling about this. It seems so obvious!

&gt;   I downloaded it, just have to learn how to use it now. There seems to be

&gt; Thank you so much for bringing this to our attention.
&gt;
&gt; This is something I felt touched by immediately and definitely requires
&gt; further investigation, research and experimentation.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;m all over this...I think there&#x27;s definitely something &quot;to it&quot; and it

&gt;  The application for EVP staggers the imagination. I was just reading on
&gt; Above Top Secret where they think aliens are embedding images in sound, more
&gt; likely it&#x27;s spirits/etherics as well as ET. Now this is brings ITC into the
&gt; 21st century!
&gt;
&gt;  A guy did a post on my FB page about this, he records using the RT-EVP and
&gt; converts it to images.
