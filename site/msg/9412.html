Where can I get my hands on some crystals, and how much do they cost?  What type of store or place would I find them in?

Any clear Quartz is good for bring energy into a room. Looks like 
the crystal enhancer they are putting into the MiniBox is an Asian 
quartz crystal wand. A wand emits both positive and negative energy. 
It strongly amplifies energy and focuses it to where it is needed. 

I use a lot of different kinds of crystal when meditating. The one I 
seem to have the strongest communication with are called Lemurian 
Quartz. When I use them they literal start vibrating in my palms. 

Apophyllite is another good crystal for spirit communication but it 
usually only comes in a cluster.

Hope this helps. If you have any other questions on crystal I am a 
huge rock hound and have been using and studying the properties of 
crystal for a long time.
