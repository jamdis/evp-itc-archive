&gt; Well, seemed like someone that knew more, but she falls short, in that she thinks Earth is it, you never leave here, and never progress any further. Everyone here seems to think you can judge everything by this level of existence, where you have no inetellect, no perception, and are psychically(spiritually) deaf and dumb, especially in this day and age!
