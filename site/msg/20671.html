 That's why I find it frustrating that most insist on running aorund in the=
 dark to get evidence and EVP when they could stay home and get much more. =
Spirits and entities travel, even the ones that are supposedly stuck will c=

pots hoping beyond hope to get scared out their wits by imaginary demons.
