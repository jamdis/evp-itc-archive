<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Sarah is such a brave visionary. Jen &amp; I met her at the Atlanta AA-EVP 
meeting a few years ago and she was surprised that attendees wanted 
their photos taken with her and asked for her autograph. It&#x27;s folks 
like her and others in this field, including some of the participants 
of this forum, that keep the research moving forward.

We&#x27;ll make sure Sarah is in our thoughts during this holiday season. -

&gt; As most of us know, Sarah Estep, was the founder of the AA-EVP--the  
&gt; route by I, and many of us, first got to the place we&#x27;re at today.  
&gt; I&#x27;ve heard from a friend of mine who is also of that generation of  
&gt; EVP tapers, that Sarah&#x27;s condition is deteriorating. I&#x27;d like to ask  
&gt; all of you to send positive thoughts her way, as she was always a  
&gt; very gracious lady who was more than helpful to many, many people 
who  
&gt; were interested in taping. I bought my first equipment from Sarah&#x27;s  
&gt; husband and benefited greatly from her wisdom, always given freely.  
&gt; She will be remembered as giant in this field.
&gt; 
&gt; Please think of her kindly this Christmas Eve.

&gt; Ann
