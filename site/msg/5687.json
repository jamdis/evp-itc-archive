And to help ease =\r\nthem into \n      aproaching a session eventually with confidence\n\n      and=\r\n determination as well as full curiousity for all types of the \n      commu=\r\nnication we recieve.\n\n      My initial post of the ritual file was done wit=\r\nh the best of \n      intentions and meant to be another tool available for =\r\nthose who felt \n\n      they needed or wanted to employ it. it is a simple i=\r\nnnocent prayer \n      ritual, I don&#39;t think it is really worthy of all this=\r\n debate.\n\n      Use it, don&#39;t use it. It&#39;s there if you want it. Also I mus=\r\nt say \n      there are two kinds of fear the kind that is natural and a god=\r\n \n\n      given emotion for self preservation, ie the fright and flight refl=\r\nex \n      that is an instinctive trait in all of us. Then you have the \n\n  =\r\n    irrational dibilitating phobic fear that can turn an individual into \n =\r\n     a frozen statue. That type of fear I believe is unhealthy\n\n      and s=\r\nhould be addressed and dealt with and learned how to harness. I \n      also=\r\n believe that anyone that harbors that type of fear \n\n      would not be dr=\r\nawn to the paranormal anyway and in a case of such \n      fear it would alr=\r\neady be present and doing a small protection \n\n      ritual would not fuel =\r\nit any further. So lets take it for what it is, \n      something to utilize=\r\n in our box of tools like an emf meter.\n\n      you may have an old rusty od=\r\nd sized wrench at the bottom of your tool \n      box at home that you inher=\r\nited from your grandfather and have never \n      used\n\n      but if you com=\r\ne across that odd nut that needs tightening somedsy you \n      will be glad=\r\n you have it.\n\n      Bruce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------\n  Need to know the score, the latest=\r\n news, or you need your Hotmail=AE-get your &quot;fix&quot; Check it out.&lt;http://www.=\r\nmsnmobilefix.com/Default.aspx&gt; \n\n   \r\n------=_NextPart_000_001F_01C859BF.DB41D750\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3Dtext/html;charset=3Diso-8859-1&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16587&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY id=\r\n=3DMailContainerBody \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 10px; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FON=\r\nT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #000000; BORDER-TOP-STYLE: none; PADDING-TOP: 15px; FO=\r\nNT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; BORDER-RIGHT-STYLE: none; BORDER-LE=\r\nFT-STYLE: none; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; TEXT-DECORATION: none; BORDER-BO=\r\nTTOM-STYLE: none&quot; \nleftMargin=3D0 topMargin=3D0 acc_role=3D&quot;text&quot; CanvasTab=\r\nStop=3D&quot;true&quot; \nname=3D&quot;Compose message area&quot;&gt;&lt;!--[gte IE 5]&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace=\r\n prefix=3D&quot;v&quot; /&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix=3D&quot;o&quot; /&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Yes =\r\nBruce, &quot;We want to kill you&quot; is word&nbsp;for word what I hear.&nbsp; \nThan=\r\nk you for being the first person ever to validate this for me, because now =\r\nI \nknow it&#39;s REAL, I&#39;m not crazy, and it isn&#39;t&nbsp;my imagination.&nbsp; T=\r\nhis was \ncaptured on a&nbsp;digital voice recorder while I was heating coff=\r\nee in the \nmicrowave oven nearby, and I&nbsp;felt that the microwave&nbsp;m=\r\nust have been a \npowerful energy source for the &quot;speaker.&quot;&nbsp; It may be =\r\nimportant to note that \nI had just invited spirits inside the house from ou=\r\ntside, and that after \nI&nbsp;listened to this message I told them to go ba=\r\nck outside because they were \ntoo rude to continue talking to.&nbsp; I&#39;ve t=\r\nried to replicate this experiment a \nnumber of times since then (without th=\r\ne verbal invitation into my home) and have \nhad no luck whatsoever.&nbsp; &lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Gleefully moving on to box research!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Robin&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQ=\r\nUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BOR=\r\nDER-LEFT: #000000 2px solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt=\r\n arial&quot;&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt aria=\r\nl&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A \n  title=3Dmailto:paranormalinvestigating@... \n =\r\n href=3D&quot;mailto:paranormalinvestigating@...&quot;&gt;bruce halliday&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A \n  title=3Dmailto:evp-i=\r\ntc@yahoogroups.com \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:evp-itc@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;evp-itc@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Friday=\r\n, January 18, 2008 5:18 \n  AM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Su=\r\nbject:&lt;/B&gt; RE: [EVP-ITC] this damned \n  protection debate--Bruce&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n  &lt;P&gt;Robin,&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;In the evp fi=\r\nle you posted I believe I&#39;m hearing &quot;we \n  want to kill you&quot;&lt;BR&gt;please let =\r\nme know if that is what you \n  hear.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Robin, I am glad to hear =\r\nthat the protection ritual will be \n  utilized by you &lt;BR&gt;in the purpose it=\r\n was intended.
