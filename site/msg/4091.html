<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Joel, if I spoke other languages I would try. There seems to be
some psychic link between the experimenter and the device so responses
in a language you cannot speak could be challenging.

 If any of my peers on this forum have statements or observations that
could be shared I will try to work those in tonights interview. I went
ahead and agreed to the interview after first conferring with Frank as
I want this to represent the work done by the members here. -Bill

only understand English or has anyone tried to see if other languages
 would work also ?

folks behind the event at The Stanley Hotel that Frank attended
&gt;  last month have invited me for a chat tonight to discuss ITC. I&#x27;ll be
&gt;  on Darknessradio.com at 9 p.m. Pacific time. This message has been
&gt;  posted after speaking to Frank since for me, ITC includes the research
&gt;  that is covered by this group as well as the video ITC experiments
&gt;  I&#x27;ve done. -Bill
