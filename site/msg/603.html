I think possibly it varies with each researcher but for me the use of tv light to stimulate the images seems to provoke some of the clearest "artwork photos". I think if I had a better cam that the crystal method would produce some greater details as well. I had some good/mediocre results with the feedback loop method but these other methods have been much more fruitful and promising.
   
  I have had recognizable faces using all the above methods and tons of faces that I do not know. I can only suggest you work it in with EVP audio sessions with your group on the other side. They can assist you better than I could as to what method will work best for you to strengthen the bond and open the door.
   
  Sometimes we all just need to be more open to thinking outside of the box. If I did things the way all the "experts" did I would never have gotten very far. It may work well for them but I am not them so as a student in this field, I chose to study the process by hands on research. I will never say I am an expert. I dont think anyone is even those on the other side have difficulty. There are just some spirits who are better at the communication than others and are willing to put in the effort to make it work. I am lucky to have several in my group that do thier best to get through the veil no matter how thick it may become. 
   
  My recording methods may work for some people, then again they may not. The only way to find out is try it for themselves. The same goes for anyones method. You could just make your own methods with your groups help thru EVP. Let me know how it works out I'd love to see the pics!
   
  For demo purposes I'd say heres your experiment. Next time go with a laptop, a webcam, a half-dollar size rough rose quartz crystal, a flashlight, and sport video player to playback/copy frame shots easily. They can literally watch the images form as you record if you get a good connection going. It is quite amazing. Just jerk/wave the light back and forth very quickly over the rock while recording close-up to it until you start to see a glow then a pulsation starts and you see a shift just before the images start to appear. Almost like tuning reception on an old tv sort of. I am still using an old logitech with the new logitech software ( which records much smoother! ).

            Misty - We recently demonstrated ITC recording techniques for members of our local research group. I set up the feedback method then the white video noise recording method. I somehow feel the feedback method will yield the results I am hoping for but haven't reviewed enough work of our collegues in the field to compare success ratios for each method. I recorded three minutes of each setup and we did a quick review but didn't have time during that meeting to transfer the recorded material into a computer for proper frame by frame analysis.
   
  Which recording method do you believe is the most effective?
