Is it the same as doing evp? asking for my guide to come forward and such? I do have people that i want to talk to on the other side, but i have not asked for anyone by name. My fear is that an imposter will step forward. I have been wating for the ones that have spoken to name themselves. However they have NOT. Alot of this is very confusing for me, as i am really new to this. I have talked to a girl online from my same city that does ummm cant think of the name of it, but its writing.............like in a trance/meditation state and &quot;they&quot; use your hand to write on paper. This idea does kinda freak me out. I want to find some other sources for communication. I DONT want to INVITE entitys in, rather talk to the ones that are already here...........make sense?\n   \n  amy\n\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/\n   \n  LON3_S7AR  YAHOO MESENGER ID\n\n __________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
