<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The ancient Greeks were way ahead of Nostradamus with their 
psychomanteum work (more recently resurrected by famed NDE researcher - 
Raymond Moody...see his book &quot;Reunions&quot; for more details). One of the 
major Psychomanteums (big &quot;P&quot;) that Moody visited was a huge complex 
which culminated in a large, darkened room containing a huge, bronze or 
copper kettle filled with water wherein particpants could commune with 
their ancestors.

&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s pretty cool.
&gt; 
&gt; I think Nostradamus did use something similar with fire and water 
gazing, also called scrying (often used with a mirror too), along with 
meditation, nutmeg as a hallucinogen, and a plethora of other 
techniques.  Although I think he used it to see the future rather than 
people from the past.  However, I think you can use it for both.
