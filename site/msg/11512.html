 I paid $3 for this old VCR at a thrift store. This is where I get most of=
 the shielded wire I use for the volume contorls, and sweep rate controls. =
The old electolytic caps may be usable, but they are old enough that they m=
ay have degraded, dried up, or gone bad. I do pull the disc caps though, an=
d some of the 1/8 watt reisitors. Oh yeah, and the trimpots. This is also o=
ld electronics, and does contain lead, but it's ok as long as you don't eat=
 the parts. You should turn the stripped board in to recycle, I do that wit=
h mine through work.   Frank gathering corpses (dead VCRs)
