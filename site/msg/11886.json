I have to base my  \n&gt; conclusions on the EVP files, not speculation, even from the  \n&gt; victims. Do you know of instances where they audibly claimed to be  \n&gt; nonhuman? I may have missed them--I heard a lot of EVPs from them,  \n&gt; but certainly not the sum total. (As I said--I even got one myself  \n&gt; the other day.)\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you&#39;re right that they are definitely mobile, and a  \n&gt; collective.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ann\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ____________________________________________________________\n&gt; Save hundreds on an Unsecured Loan - Click here.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\nTha 's a logical assump ion, bu I don' hink i can be accep ed as ac .
