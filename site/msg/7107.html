Ann,
 
All I did was make a comment, was that so wrong?  I did it for  ever=
yone 
especially asking that he take it private and not post it in this  pu=
blic forum.  
And for that I deserve to be bashed and receive a  threatenin=
g letter.  Would 
you like to see a copy of this letter as to how  he threa=
tened me and calling 
me names?
And you yourself never mention that he shou=
ld apologize to me either.   Have 
I ever done anything to offend you?  Unf=
ortunately these are the type  of 
people we are dealing with and again I w=
ill say IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN A  
PRIVET EMAIL.  Is that so much to a=
sk?
 
Now after that has been said I would like to wish you luck with your =
 
research on your new box.
 
Jeff

Just  and FYI on the conflict of interest idea. The decisio=

action  did not even come up until after Bruce's post to Jef=

 taken was not unilateral, meaning it wasn't just L=
