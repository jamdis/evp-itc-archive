<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I believe what I have heard were recordings of him in late age. We&#x27;ll  
have to see if we can find one of those to compare it to. But I think  
there is quite an interesting similarity between the two you have  
placed together.

&gt; I decided to look up old recordings of the man to see what does he  
&gt; sound like as a live person. I didnt find much but I did manage to  
&gt; download one recording of harvey firestone introducing him and  
&gt; saying it was the first time he allowed his voice to be recorded.  
&gt; It was done in early 1900&#x27;s.The stranger thing is the first words  
&gt; out of his mouth were the same as the evp &quot;this is edison speaking&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I made a little side by side comparison and tho it doesnt sound  
&gt; exact it is remarkably similar to his voice in the rest of the  
&gt; recording. Id upload that but its too big for an attachment. If  
&gt; anyone wants the link to download the whole thing http:// 
&gt; cylindersontheweb.angelcities.com/rare_recordings.htm look for the  
&gt; &quot;firestone&quot; one from 1919 14 THOMAS EDISON introduced by HARVEY  
&gt; FIRESTONE - Let Us Not Forget
&gt;
&gt; Heres the side by side of his voice and my evp for anyone whos  
&gt; curious.

&gt; Just as an aside, Misty--I&#x27;ve heard recordings of Edison&#x27;s voice  
&gt; and this struck me right away as a very similar one. Each time I  
&gt; listen to it, I feel more strongly that it could be him.
&gt;
&gt; The third recording &quot;We have conscious...&quot; is equally as amazing.
&gt;
&gt; Wonderful stuff!

&gt;&gt; Kinda freaky beacause it was so loud and clear and unexpected. Was  
&gt;&gt; a good session I had a few good ones come thru but not sure how  
&gt;&gt; others will hear them. Too many to post. This one however I think  
&gt;&gt; is loud and clear for most. Using the ST Method.
