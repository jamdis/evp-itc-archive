No, they are made of catalin, which is vaguely similar to bakelite but is
made by a different process. It could be colored in bright colors which was
perfect for the Art Deco era. Catalin did not withstand the passage of time
well and there haven't been any catalin radios made since around WWII. There
aren't too many of those around any more.

If you want to get an idea of what they are worth now, go to eBay and do a
search for "catalin radio."
