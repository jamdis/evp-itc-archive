Hi Sharon,

Thanks so much for the =
info and pics from your experiments! It seems I had read somewhere that whe=
n a camera is a true full spectrum that the visible light may wash out anyt=
hing seemn in the UV or IR range. Since most of my ghost hunts tend to be r=
estricted to daytime, the Moditronics full (duo) spectrum seems like the be=
tter camera for me right now.

I do want a Spectercam 3 as well. I guess I'=
ll have to start saving up for one. They each seem to be great cameras in t=
heir own respect.

 Well, photos of true anomalies can help substantiate any EVPs captured and=
, I might add here, the Moditronics camcorders also record sound (unlike DV=
R cameras, such as Spectercams, where you would need to have a separate aud=
io recorder if you want sound to go with the images). And yes, I have also =
picked up EVPs on my camcorders.

Moditronics full spectrum camera on one of their shows this year.)
