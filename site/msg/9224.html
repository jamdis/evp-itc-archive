<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello Everyone,

I am relatively new to this group. I have been studying about ITC
research and EVP&#x27;s for some time. I started doing EVP&#x27;s with my Sony
tape recorder about three weeks ago. So far, I have gotten many Class
A EVP&#x27;s.

On Sunday, I did my recording from my bedroom. I am disabled and was
in quite a bit of pain that evening. I just listened to the tape a few
minutes ago and was astounded. I can hear a good friend of mine, Jean,
that passed in 1991, calling my name as clear as a bell. Then someone
else, whispers my name loudly into the tape recorder. After that you
can hear a young girl giggle. I think it was her that whispered into
the tape recorder. 

I had tears of joy realizing that my good friend is trying to contact me. 

Has anyone else had Spirits laugh or giggle on an EVP. That part kind
of made me nervous.

Thanks everyone,

Jeremy
