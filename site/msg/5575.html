<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello all, I am new to the group and I have uploaded an EVP file I made 
with my new Digital Voice recorder in my bedroom this morning.  I had a 
really kick butt one that I sent to TAPs.  A little girl, clear as a 
bell but there was nothing I could do with it.  Hopefully TAPs can do 
something with it.

Now, the file I put up, if you listen REALLY close when I ask a 
question there are tiny bell sounds right after the question.  I have 
another almost 10 minute EVP where I left the recorder in the room, no 
windows or doors open and when I went in to turn it off there was a 
very strong scent of old fashioned tea rose.

If anyone could bump up the 2nd one to see what the low voices are 
saying that would be great, drop me an e-mail.  I am a sensitive but 
would love to learn how to also use some equiptment to help me out.

Thank you 

Saqqara</pre>
