&gt; Steve,
&gt;  
&gt; I listened to the file, It could have said what is labeled.
&gt; It was kinda rough and I don&#x27;t think anyone but an experienced
&gt; researcher used to listening to Frank&#x27;s box would hear anything
&gt; from the random mode especially.
&gt;  
&gt; I think you may have gotten caught up in the moment, I know those 
group sessions can get exciting.
&gt; My advice would be to hold off on any public display sessions until 
we refine the communivation to 
&gt; where the average listener is capable of hearing a response. Don&#x27;t 
forget what happened on halloween in staten Island.
&gt; Or what happened to those knuckle heads at pulse radio.
&gt;  
&gt; I think it would be detrimental to the research not to go somewhere 
and have a group of people hear nothing but what 
&gt; they discern as noise. for the simple reason that they are not 
equiped to hear the actual responses.
&gt;  
&gt; Just my opinion as afriend and fellow researcher. also I believe 
our friend Frank believes that the box was not meant 
&gt; for field work and does not perform to the best of it&#x27;s ability in 
a public situation.

&gt;  
&gt; I have been having weird sessions with Frank&#x27;s Box #27, but in a 
good way.  They told me to change the antenna, which it did and the 
random started working and never has on this box.  They told me 
tonight to put the old antenna back on and the sessions keep getting 
better and better.  I dragged Juli and Joel in on what i believed and 
felt was going to be a great box session and here is a file only a 
couple minutes in to our hour long session.  This is a bit rough 
sounding, but hearing it live is pretty clear and you can hear me 
respond and than Joel agrees that he heard it too.  My sessions are 
pretty incredible since the random mode started working on the FB#27 
and i feel the random is the best thing out there...hands down.  I 
have done Sessions on the internet through Skype all week and i feel 
the energy between Juli and I are really bringing them through 
clearly.  I only use FB#27 now in random mode and it is the best 
feature on any box, between the white noise, echo and random there is 
no competetion up to this point.  The hacks are good, but nothing is 
better than an original frank&#x27;s box.  Our friends on the other side 
told me that they fixed the random mode to go and teach others and i 
am going to a meeting on wednesday to demonstrate the different boxes 
and our friend made a promise to come though if i go....so we will 
see.
&gt;  
&gt; Here is one of the files i got so far.
