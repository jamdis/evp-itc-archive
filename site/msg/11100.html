sell a ham radio speaker that works great.&nbsp; It runs around 
$25.00 also.&nbsp; Don't forget to buy a recorder or a miciphone for 
your cpu to record your seesions.&nbsp; I think recording straight 
on the cpu is the best way to do it, but almost everybody is going 
to disagree with me on that subject.&nbsp; Thats the way that I do 
it, and I didn't have to go out and buy a recorder for 100 bucks.
