Nope, not crazy.=A0 You have to remember that the human mind excels at patt=
ern recognition.=A0 It is what we do better than any other animal or machin=
e.=A0 When we see or hear something that almost looks or sounds like someth=
ing else, then our mind attempts to match it to known patterns.

This is wh=
y EVPs and ITCs are so difficult, because we have to be constantly on guard=
 against our own minds and it's love of pattern matching=A0 )
