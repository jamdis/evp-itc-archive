You say you don&#39;t know\n&gt; &gt; Chris\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personally but that it seems I am the one wearing rose \ncolored\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; glasses. I do know Chris. Even when Frank is upset he\n&gt; &gt; says &quot;Chris\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nice guy&quot;. Chris&#39; statements and beliefs have never changed\n&gt; &gt; while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others can be wishy washy depending on the day. The view \nthat\n&gt; &gt; Chris\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does not want any one to research the box besides him is \nBS. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fact\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is that prior to Franks original yahoo group disappearing, \nChris\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; provided a link directly to the schematics. In his\n&gt; &gt; presentations he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would tell people that the schematics were available online.\n&gt; &gt; Yet,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because he is against mass production, it MUST be because he\n&gt; &gt; wants\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; research all to himself. Rose colored glasses or a case of \nonly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seeing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what is wanted? This is a fact compared to perceptions and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opinions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Almost each and every user of a box or it&#39;s facsimile \nhave\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stated that lower energy/evil/dark... entities have spoken \nvia\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; device.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Rick Moran states that the groups for testing will \ninclude\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believers, skeptics, senior citizens, (now here&#39;s where it \ngets\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scary)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CHILDREN and HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Couple the last two facts together and do the math. One\n&gt; &gt; mentally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unstable child or youth hears the box tell him it is right \nto\n&gt; &gt; kill\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rape or .....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Rick Moran in his article about Tools being only as \ngood\n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; users states, &quot;...know how they work before you go into the\n&gt; &gt; field.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, in one place we are still testing, in another we are \nsending\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out in the field to be tested by groups that include \nchildren\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; school students. The good thing is that a nice little online\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tutorial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is available with some warnings. Phew! As long as this can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on anyone I guess all the bases are covered (tongue in \ncheek).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Chris has been the primary tester of the device in the\n&gt; &gt; field.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That fact deserves consideration, at the very least.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Last night, a radio personality on Spooky South Coast\n&gt; &gt; claimed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that after he engaged the dark voices coming through the \nbox,\n&gt; &gt; he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physically attacked.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Frank has stated that in the beginning Chris was the \nonly\n&gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who understood how the box should be used.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Some people who have received boxes from Frank \ndiscovered\n&gt; &gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were not able to use them although they worked fine for \nFrank.\n&gt; &gt; These\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same people would not return the boxes to be looked at.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: After death communications have been received via both\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and phones. If it were simply the devices and not the users\n&gt; &gt; would we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not have millions of these communications?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: Mark Macy states that in an after death communication\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication with Konstanin Raudive in which Mark asks &quot; \nCan\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me about the equipment you use to produce a perfect, almost\n&gt; &gt; perfect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; voice on earth?&quot; Konstanin replies &quot;Well it depends on your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reception-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or mainly your psychic reception.&quot; This fact backs up the \ntheory\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effective users are limited.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fact: In another after death communication Konstanin \naddresses\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contact\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fields saying &quot;...but if there is dissonance in the form of\n&gt; &gt; fears,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doubts, and animosities the contact field becomes\n&gt; &gt; cloudy...that&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; negative spirit groups close to earth in vibration can break\n&gt; &gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; existing bridges with troubling results.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And so yes, maybe I wear rose colored glasses.
