<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Robin, the link didn&#x27;t work (as usual on here for some reason).  If 
you can get us a good link, please do!  I want to see what he&#x27;s up 
to...

No, it&#x27;s not coincidence.  I had a quickening about it right before 
you posted it.  For some reason, I kept thinking of it with respect 
to Sumption&#x27;s inventing/workshop.  I have no idea why, as I have not 
been to or seen either place. ;)

&gt; No, I don&#x27;t believe in coincidence!!  I was told about John 
Hutchison yesterday by a biophysics engineer, who said he&#x27;s selling 
quantum batteries from his website and can be contacted directly by 
email.

&gt; 
&gt;   Yes, I have listened to him on Coast to Coast AM before. He was 
never 
&gt;   able to explain how his levitation of objects worked. The 
military was 
&gt;   interested in his experiments...but could never dulicate the 
effects. 
&gt;   Not sure where he is with things, now, other than selling his 
videos.
&gt; 
&gt;   I can&#x27;t believe you posted this, as I was just thinking of him 
&gt;   (especially his workshop and connecting it with Frank S for some 
&gt;   reason) in the last day or so. Coincidence? Probably not.

&gt;   &gt; Are you guys familiar with this? I&#x27;d never heard of the man or 
his 
&gt;   &gt; work before.
