I know Im a newbie too but I can see your point and agree that taking out some of the dead air, static with no words and the click click click click(of the 469) that comes in between words cant hurt...as long as people arent cutting words out from other sections of the session and pasting them to fit with their questions...and as long as they arent waiting 30 secs or more and counting any type of response as a response to that paticular question.(if that makes sense).  I dont see how cutting out dead air or static or clicking can make someone less of a serious researcher.

          Joel,
 
I don't think anyone would wait 30 seconds after a question and 
associate a word or phrase to be the answer to that question.
 
Also in a thirty second period if the researcher has not asked another question and moved on
someone should try and help them with how they are doing a session.
 
You Know I clip all the useless fragment crap out of my files, are you trying to say you hold your research to a higher
degree than I do?
 
And because the crap sounds are cut from a file does not make it pieced together.
If a researcher is taking words from different parts of a recording and putting them together to make a sentence
that would be piecing them together, that would be an out and out fake.
 
As long as the researcher has the original clip to present upon request by a reputable source, that should prevent
questions of the files validity.

          if you clip them  and put together  the answer  how will you know that it was a excepted amount of time?if you ask a question  and receive  a answer
after 30seconds  to me and what i post is unacceptable. but then i hold my reasearch to a high degree than most .30 seconds might not sound like a lot  but  your phone rings  7 times  in 30 seconds. any clip i hear that arre pieced together also  i ignore. sorry that just me  .

    Hi All,
  Here�s my take�or 2 cents worth..:-)
   
  Share your files all clipped without the garbage for others to listen to. Save your original files for further development and records, in the case a scientific organization wants to �hear� the original along with the clipped, walahh you have both. And everyone is Happy!

      Bruce    To add to what you said, the capacity of the yahoo forum we are with does not permit long recordings and the messages we have been receiving seem to be getting longer and longer each passing month.  Not much room for the "gargage."  I for one prefer to hear the important message words, knowing full well the author edited the file.  If someone wants to present false stuff so that he or she gets false praise from us,  god bless them if they need the praise.  For scientific research with original files...that' s another story.

        Stefan,
 
I do remove the "garbage" from my files.
 
At this point in my research, the message is more important to me than the proof of it.
I think most of us here will agree that we are receiving some sort of paranormal communication.
but it definitely exists. now we need to concentrate on the messages they need us to hear and the answers to the questions
we ask and in turn our answers to their questions. Anyone that cleans a file in this way should not be touching any bit of the file
that has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously garbage like the "EH O EH AH O EH UR" in between words.
 
For example "Is there anyone here that wishes to communicate_ YES_AH ER EEH AR OOO AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE"
It is much easier for me as a researcher to be able to return to a file that I recieved two weeks ago and that I believe may hold some
relivence to a message I just received and be able to cleanly listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage sounds.
 
At this stage in real time communication the messages are the top priority.
I do however agree that the untouched version should be retained and made available to individuals that make a request 
for any intelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that may be made, and god knows there are always fanatical 
sceptics lurking in the shadows awaiting an opportunity to attack an unwary or injured researcher. I do not think that 
our research files should be made available on request by every tom dick and harry that is unknown to us and may potentially
doctor the file to suit their own point and post it as such.
 
I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the researcher that receives the request for raw research data should 
scrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment before handing out any research data.
 
These are my thoughts on the subject of cleaning a file.
 
Bruce

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Editing EVP
        Hi all,

just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I would
suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, in
order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can for
instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (including
the experimenter' s voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, but
not cut out individual pieces (supposed "garbage") to make an EVP match
with what it "should be". At least, the unedited version should always
be provided along with the edited version.

But that's only my personal opinion which I thought I had to express, as
we should always be able to present our results to a critical public.

Stefan
