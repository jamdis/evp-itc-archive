I \nhave developed a lot of interest in the audio/video aspect of \ninvestigating and was pleased to find this group.\n\nI have a request.  I have been reading up on Frank&#39;s box and the RS \nhack and have been curious to experiment with a gadget of this sort. \nHowever, I haven&#39;t gone ahead until now, since I just unexpectedly \nfound an older model 12-470 in our local RS store and snapped it up. \n\nWhat I need are written instructions (versus the video) for the \nmodifications needed.  Unfortunately, hubby and I live in the stix and \ndo not yet have high speed access. THe videos look wonderful but simply \ntake far too long to download on dialup for us.\n\nIs someone out there in possession of written instructions and would \nthey be willing to share them?  I would really appreciate it.  Thx!"}
