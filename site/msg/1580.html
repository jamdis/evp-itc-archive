<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Give one to Bruce before me, Frank. He&#x27;s a great guy and he deserves  
it a lot more; he&#x27;s got more time for research and a lot of friends  
on the others side he wants and needs to talk to.

&gt; hey Frank,
&gt; thanks for the reply to my post. I am disabled from toxins I breathed
&gt; at ground zero during rescue and recovery efforts, I was a first
&gt; responder so we got the worst of it and it has left me with a lung
&gt; disease and two heart attacks but I&#x27;m not handicaped I have total
&gt; mobility I just have to take it easy. So as you may see I have alot of
&gt; time for experimenting and have been doing evp research as well as itc
&gt; for some time now and your box has touched a special cord with me it
&gt; just feels like I should have and be using one. Don&#x27;t ask me to  
&gt; explain
&gt; it&#x27;s just this wierd feeling like something is telling me you are  
&gt; meant
&gt; to use this tool. If you can ever see your way clear as to building  
&gt; one
&gt; for me I would be more than glad to pay for your time labor and
&gt; materials and would be forever appreciative.
&gt;
&gt; your friend
