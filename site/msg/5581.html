Awesome clip Frank, that is clear as a bell.  I love the fact that they seem to know so much as to what is going on in our personal live, such as your pizza clip or Bruce's phone ringing clip.  As you take a step back and look at the bigger picture as to what the true means are regarding the clips, we can assume that they acknowledge us more than what we actually know.  By them comfirming facts here on this plane and what we are experiencing at that moment is hugh for our research.
   
  Just my thoughts!

 There's alot more to ITC than getting a dead person's name, or some techno guide, it can be amazing if ya don't prejudge what's supposed to come thorugh, or block it by expectations.
