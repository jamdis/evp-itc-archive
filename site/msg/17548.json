Unfortunatley you \n&gt; will  hear her say what she thinks she hears in the files. Please try not \n&gt; to be  influenced by her. I will admit though that she seems to hear these \n&gt; things  much better then I can.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though I am still not convinced, some of these  are uncanny, and I was \n&gt; surprised. I will be conducting ongoing, regular  experiments with this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Opinions are  welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; April\n&gt;"}
