All \nwe had to pay was a digging fee which was, then, just a few dollars. It may of gone up by \nnow. This was in the early 90&#39;s when my (first) wife and I went a couple of times to Hot \nSprings, Arkansas to dig crystals. At that time I lived in Texas (I am originally from \nOklahoma), so it was about a four hour drive from Dallas.\n&gt; \n&gt; We had a wonderful time and found a plethora of beautiful crystals. Even some sizable \nclusters. The energy of the crystals is very strong when you bring them out of the dirt as \nthey have been in Mother Earth their whole lives. They have a rust color appearance and \nthey have to be soaked in the solution that you use to clean pools. I would say all in all \neach trip we netted about ten pounds or so of crystals. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, if any of you like to camp there are numerous wonderful state parks in that area \nthat have very nice camping facilities, plus even some cabins and shelters. The lakes there \nare crystal clear and you can see to the bottom. We found Lake De Grey the most beautiful \nof the ones in that area that we visited.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope this helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many Blessings All,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeremy \n&gt; New York, New York\n&gt;"}
