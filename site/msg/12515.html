I don&#x27;t believe, as history proves, that Satan is anything more than  
an idea of the early church&#x27;s to
cast blame and scare people. For me, he doesn&#x27;t exist.

And yes, Satan is a made up character of the early church. This is  
well documented historically.
You can Google the topic on your own if you wish. He&#x27;s a mythic  
character no more real than Zeus or Apollo and
only as real as you want to make him in your own mind.

I&#x27;ll decline further comment as the original conversation was between  
Marty &amp; myself and not a list topic. I&#x27;m sure Misty would appreciate  
it if we declined further debate.
