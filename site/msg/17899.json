The kind of radio that was in use when radio was\nfirst invented. There is a modern chip version, it has three pins and is\nvery simple to set up. TRF has the advantage of less noise and static, but\nin a box the stations tend to over lap, but it still can give good results.\nIt&#39;s the same radio in earlier version of the Mini box, and Chapple also\nused it in one of his projects. I have found it&#39;s best to wind the coil and\ntweak it to the radio by removing tunrs until it covers the AM band. I start\nwith 70 turns of wire, the remove five at a time--or you could just wind\nsixty turns and leave it at that, but being anal I tend to over do it.\n\n At 3 seconds &quot;April, that gorgeous (capsule)&quot;, at 6 seconds &quot;break it up&quot;,\nand 11 seconds &quot;that woman-talk to Hultay&quot;.\n\n F-S\n\nTRF= uned adio equency.
