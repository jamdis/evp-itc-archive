I never believe anything I hear on the news anymore... the only thing I trust anymore is the firm knowledge that everyone in power in the world today are all a bunch of b******s corrupt beyond belief, ruthless to the core, willing to sell their own mother for instant gratification... so you can better your bottom dollar they don&#39;t give a rat about you or me... ok I better stop now, this a ghost box forum :D ......\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;urkel232002&quot; &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; We are going to run out of money soon i think.
