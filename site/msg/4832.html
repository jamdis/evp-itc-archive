<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>it was where he was asking his dad somethionog that is all i 
know regarding the one i listened to.  that makes more sense though 
for some odd reason there arent any others that have brought up two 
way communication so im afraid i was wrong! Thanks for doin that for 
me and bruce. I am glad there is other ways that specialize in 
communicating with the deceased.  i have no clue why i have never 
heard of that but thanks for the heads up...tons of things everyone 
isnt aware of.. so you answered the one i wanted 
answered .

&gt; That isn&#x27;t his dad--it&#x27;s Mike, his guide.
&gt; 
&gt; What you&#x27;re hearing are artifacts of the sound clean-up program 
that  
&gt; makes the voices more audible.
&gt; 
&gt; These are not EVPs, they are realtime communication. They are 
heard  
&gt; out loud as they happen. That&#x27;s what boxes do--they allow two-way  
&gt; real-time exchange between us and them.

&gt; &gt; Now I am sure you arent aware of who I am being, noone else other
&gt; &gt; than misty welcomed me to this group. Being I am not professional 
at
&gt; &gt; e.v.p.s but yet have gone through listening to many of them from
&gt; &gt; trustful resources, your e.v.p.s make me a bit leery. NOt trying 
to
&gt; &gt; be rude, so dont go get all upset right off the bat. In your 
e.v.p.s,
&gt; &gt; this one especially, alot of them sound like you, not the part 
where
&gt; &gt; you asking questions, but where your dad is supposively answering
&gt; &gt; you. NOw everyone has their own right to opinion so there is now 
need
&gt; &gt; to get defensive, if all is real there would be nothing to get mad
&gt; &gt; about. I just cant help but notice how odd it is that your e.v.p.
&gt; &gt; questions to your father, seems to answer right away when you ask 
the
&gt; &gt; question. Also, i notice that after you ask the question i hear
&gt; &gt; something being turned on that has contains the answer to that
&gt; &gt; question. Whether it be your dad or not. I feel its you that is
&gt; &gt; answering, but let me tell you why i figure this.. and please you
&gt; &gt; would like to defend you side of things that would be great, 
maybe i
&gt; &gt; would be able to change my opinion on the matter. But as of now,
&gt; &gt; e.v.p.s are usually done on the same tape that the questions are 
on,
&gt; &gt; then in a rewind you can hear you and the e.v.p. but to me it 
sound
&gt; &gt; like you put the e.v.p. response on another tape. i am not trying 
to
&gt; &gt; start any kind of fight or be cruel, maybe i could learn 
something on
&gt; &gt; behalf of how you do your work... thank you
