<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Had these made up a couole years ago, didn&#x27;t use all of them cuz dual
supply, and none of the newer functions. So added the AM boost and Photo
sweep to this board. #118

 Some technically ignorant dweeb claimed I had done nothing with the boxes
sine since 2000.  I think what he meant was that I had done nothing to
increase his fame a fortune lately, so he still has to rely on lies and
exageration to make a name for himself in boxolgy.
