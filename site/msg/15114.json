Yes.....with the little girl saying &quot;I want my paaaw&quot; then woman (warble tone) saying &quot;big girl&quot; ....... those words &quot;Big Girl&quot; do stand out well. Is a shame the little girls voice is so difficult.

Kids hang out around the water in summer. Was a misty-rainy day when I recorded. No kids have been out yet.....school just recently out. I hear a train off in distance from another location, I repeat that I hear a train into the recorder. Then a &quot;smart mouthed&quot; young teenager says a cuss word (is in title)  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Jim%27s%20RR-DR60%20EVP%27s/train-hey-dumb-fuck-evp.mp3 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; &gt; http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; clockdryve &lt;clockdryve@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
