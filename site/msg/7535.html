Hi!  My name is Wes Kellington and I live in Waynesboro, VA with my wife,
Stephanie, and three
daughters, Emily (15), Molly (12), & Hannah (10).  I'm a 38-year-old
computer technician.

I have been reading paranormal literature since I was a kid.  I have read
probably hundreds of books
on the subject.  I have lived in two haunted houses, and I had a paranormal
experience at my
grandparents' house as a child.  I've always found the subject fascinating.
Things go on here in
the house I live in now.  We have had the sound of women talking just out of
earshot, footsteps,
shadows, etc.

A couple of years ago I started reading about EVP and ITC and started
getting some equipment to
do my own investigating.  If only there was a local group that didn't see
faces in the grass and
think that every bit of dust was an orb!  My standards as to what amounts to
evidence of a haunting
and what does not are pretty high.  I'm thinking about starting my own
group, but that's aside
from this.

My wife bought me a 2gb Olympus digital voice recorder for Christmas, and I
have Cool Edit on
my machine, so I have been thinking about trying my hand at recording.  I
have a copy of the
Ghost Orchid on CD, containing Raudive's work; and I have been surfing the
web, listening
to other recordings.  When I heard about Frank's Box, I naturally became
excited.  Then I
found a link to this group mentioned in an email about it.  So, I joined.

I'm going to listen to the file attachments for awhile and read the posts
and sit back and learn
some more before I give it a try.

Thanks for having me!

Wes
