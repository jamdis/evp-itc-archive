My two cents then:=C2=A0 it depends on the purpose of the announcement how =
best to go about the experiment.=C2=A0 If the purpose is to confirm to your=
self or others that this was a valid prediction, or be able to make a case =
for there being something to this ITC stuff, or to have a prediction you ca=
n wave in the face of them darned skepdicks, then specifics have to be pres=
ented before the event.

If the purpose is not to do any of those things, b=
ut just try to see for yourself 'what works', then it doesn't much matter w=
hether you give details after the event, or even bothering announcing the e=
vent at all.

So the only confusing part is why announce the event at all, =
if no details are given before it takes place?=C2=A0 Besides, if the detail=
s might help save someone from harm, it would be really a bad thing to do t=
o keep them to yourself, wouldn't it?

Personally, if I thought I was getti=
ng predictions of future events that might cause harm to someone, I'd be po=
sting those details far and wide, in the hope of helping who I can.=C2=A0 N=
ot doing that... well, I just hope the person doesn't believe in karma.

      Hi,



Well, here's my two cents:



If we =
want to rule out as much "observer" interference -- whether PK or whatever =
-- the fewer details we know, the better.



So, I'm happy with a date, per=
iod.  I trust Frank's integrity to tell me if the event (if any happens) is=
 a reasonable match, or not.



I'd rather stumble onto the event on my own=
, than be accused of trying to mold the event -- or selectively focus on ju=
st certain aspects of it -- to fit criteria known ahead of time.



That's =
why I like things like the PEAR project (aka Global Consciousness Project);=
 it's just numbers.  If and how it correlates... that's what gets interesti=
ng.



Cheerfully,

Fiona
