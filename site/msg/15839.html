OMG!! You are so right Misty! Few people understand this concept. It is all=
 about and making yourself comfortable. Your prayers or whatever have no di=
rect effect on the ghosts per se, it effects you.

If you believe you are v=
ulnerable, you will be. If you believe that by asking for protection you wi=
ll be invulnerable, you will be.

    I think if you "believe" yo=
u need to do it then do it, or you will believe you are unprotected. On the=
 other hand if you have no fear then you dont give others the power to scar=
e you or intimidate you. In the end do what works best for you.

          Yeah, I totally=
 agree about reinforcing fears. Like, the more you think about something, t=
he more power you give it. But I hear so much about protection, I do it any=
way. I was just wondering if maybe there's something to it, like the messag=
e Frank posted says. Maybe it really does keep you safe. Maybe because you =
do it and give it power it keeps you safe? Something about the concept of e=
xpectation influencing the outcome of using the box? I don't know, just thi=
nking out loud here. I just wondered if anyone did the protection thing and=
 still had negative stuff come through.
