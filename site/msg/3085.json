I need to get better and better results before i start \ndoing them live with people on a regular basis.  Also, i am testing \nthe different boxes i have which all work differently.  You&#39;re more \nthan welcome to add me on your contacts if you have Skype.  It&#39;s \nfree and i&#39;m (keyportparanormal) on there.  We can test out a live \nbox session by way of skype at some point, of course no charge.  \nThis is all research purposes only and there is no need to charge to \nenlighten people on a great tool and piece of technology.  You can \ndownload it off of my website www.keyportparanormal.com or \nwww.skype.com\n\nThanx for the interest\n-Steve H.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;judy_in_hollywood&quot; \n&lt;Ticket_to_Heaven@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n&gt;       Hi Steve H., My thoughts are if the boxes DO work well for \n&gt; those that are truely interested in doing research with them - \n&gt; daily!! I&#39;d still like to experience one, but am in L.A. - where \nno \n&gt; one&#39;s doing Public demos of it = UGH! Chris -who was in San diego \n&gt; today wants $125. for the admission!! Yikes!     =Judy=\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Steve Hultay&quot; &lt;urkel23@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I started the research with a box i was lucky to have made based \n&gt; off \n&gt; &gt; of Frank&#39;s idea.  As all on this board one way or another would \n&gt; have \n&gt; &gt; done anything to get their hands on one of Frank&#39;s boxes or \n&gt; &gt; something equivalent.  So, now it&#39;s your chance to get another \n&gt; &gt; version of an already great idea and everyone&#39;s complaining.  \nIsn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; this the answer to everyone&#39;s problem, it may be pricey but i \nknow \n&gt; &gt; people who would have paid more in the past for a similar item.  \n&gt; &gt; This board is for research, this is just another idea just like \n&gt; &gt; Joe&#39;s idea of joe&#39;s box and frank&#39;s &quot;frank&#39;s box&quot;.  If this \nversion \n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t work, than the idea will kill itself.  But, now people \ncan \n&gt; &gt; get to see if they are truly meant to work with the other side \nor \n&gt; &gt; one of the 30 or 80 or whatever the number is up to now.  I \nthink \n&gt; if \n&gt; &gt; you don&#39;t like this minibox than don&#39;t buy it, but isn&#39;t anybody \n&gt; &gt; curious to see the results people get with it or don&#39;t.  Just my \n&gt; &gt; take on it, i think it&#39;s crazy that everyone is getting so upset \n&gt; &gt; about another form of communication.  It took me back at first \n&gt; &gt; because i felt this would kill my research, but we don&#39;t know if \n&gt; &gt; this even works yet.  These things happen for a reason by stuff \nout \n&gt; &gt; of our control.  All we can do is sit back and watch, and who \n&gt; didn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; think someone was going to mass produce this idea eventually \n&gt; &gt; anyway?  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Steve H.\n&gt; &gt;"}
