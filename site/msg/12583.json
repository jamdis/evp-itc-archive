One of them has a theory \nabout calcite being a substance that magnifies paranormal activity.  I \nhaven&#39;t researched it but he has. I thought it was fascinating.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians used a LOT of alabaster, which is a form of calcite.\n\nCertainly food for thought and further research ...\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Mon, 13 Oct 2008, threadsintyme@... wrote:\n\n&gt; Water conducts everything...sound to a limited extent...makes sense don&#39;t it? :D\n&gt; Al\n&gt;\n&gt; -- black bear hollow &lt;blackbearhollow@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Places with a high level water table are know to have more paranormal activity than other areas.

I am a Dowser and always check the water table of areas when I hear people speak of paranormal activity along with EMF. My best EVP&#39;s have been recorded by bodies of water.\n&gt; w\n&gt; ï¿½?\n&gt; On Oct 13, 2008, at 11:44 AM, threadsintyme@... wrote:My daughter&#39;s old apartment was like that.
