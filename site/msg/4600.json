Maybe the next time &quot;he&quot; \ncomes through you can inquire as to the name of this person I know, \nthat he knows.\nThis person was &quot;very special&quot; to him and she was hand picked by \nElvis based on her looks (she told me that), even though the duties \nshe provided at Graceland were none such that good looks were \nrequired.\n\nI&#39;m hoping if it is Elvis, he will know who you are inquiring about. \nOnly he would know this, not an Elvis impersonator.\n\nTell him her father&#39;s last name begins with the letter &quot;R&quot; and he \ntraveled with &quot;MP&quot;.  He only needs to give you her first name.\n\nWith this information I have provided, there is no doubt that &quot;he&quot; \nwill know who you are asking about.\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@...m, bruce halliday \n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks Bill,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Sorry for the misunderstanding\n&gt; I agree with you on the point of validation completely.\n&gt; Happy new year\n&gt;  \n&gt; bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: vilhellm@...: Fri, 28 Dec 2007 00:00:54 \n+0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: You guy&#39;s are not gonna believe who I \nspoke to last night\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; No additional vaildation from you is needed, I was stating that \nrecognizable voices may provide additional validation.
