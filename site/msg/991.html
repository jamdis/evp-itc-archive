Hiya Monki

          Hi everyone,
Im still new to this. Ive been recording for a year. I first started getting phone contact in the 80s but didnt know what was happening. This time I did(well as much as I can) I am , like lunalamia, concerned for the greater good..although I have become fairly close to a couple of my other worldly friends. I look forward to learning and sharing. I am adding a small segmant of something from this last weekend.
