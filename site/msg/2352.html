I haven't been able to respond to this as I would have liked to :) I have h=
ad spontaneous OOBE's all my life as well. For a long time I experienced sl=
eep paralysis. I still do on occasion, but for the most part I can break ou=
t before I get stuck. At first they were really scary, but because they wer=
e so frequent, they just became annoying LOL! I did actually see a Dr becau=
se I wanted them to stop. I don't think they believed me! The Dr literally =
just looked at me and said I'm probably just under too much stress, and to =
not sleep on my back. I have experienced it in ALL positions so it's not ju=
st a back thing for me. Anyway! 
The post about falling out of bed and then=
 still seeing you body reminded me of an interesting OBE I had experienced.=
 I was living in my first house with my husband. My oldest was about 6 and =
my middle son was a baby. I fell asleep with the baby next to me, but I was=
 sleeping in a weird position. I was locked in the sleep paralysis but deci=
ded to concentrate on my third eye. I was out! Floating about the room then=
. There were colors swirling of all kinds. It was very pretty. Then I walke=
d into my bedroom and I had a huge dresser mirror. I could not see myself. =
That was one of the things I actually feared, was looking into a mirror. I =
didn't want to see anyone else!! I was very aware that I was OBE. I decided=
 to look at the time to see when I would go back. I was going to explore mo=
re, but I got scared and then was sucked back into my body. I had a hard ti=
me fully awakening though. I was in sleep paralysis still and I kept liftin=
g my arm to see if I was out of it yet or not LOL! If I couldn't see my phy=
sical arm lift, I knew I was still in. It took a bit. The one thing I found=
 I was disappointed with was I didn't remember the time I saw. I know I loo=
ked and I know I saw it, but I couldn't remember it. I don't think I was in=
 that long.

A more recent experience that I've had and maybe someone can e=
nlighten me on. I don't know if I was OBE or not. I've had it happen more t=
han once, but I've also been awake, it's been during the day, etc. Basicall=
y I look at my watch and I see the time. I look at my watch again and it's =
a time that is earlier than I saw. I saw a time that was in the future basi=
cally. I have a schedule that I follow and while it's not real strict, I ha=
ve to pick up the kids from school, etc. I always wear a watch and I watch =
the time. This happens more frequently and I'm trying to determine why. Not=
hing special happens at the time that I "thought" it was. I had one that th=
e date was wrong! I knew it was wrong, yet the date displayed 9/23 in the b=
eginning of September more than once. Nothing happened (at least to me) on =
that day. Anyone have this time "issues" (for lack of a better term) happen=
ing too?
