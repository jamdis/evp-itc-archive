Bonnie Vent sets the record straight. The History Detectives on PBS
examine=
s who invented the Psycho-phone and Edison's interest in building
a device =
to speak to the dead.
Dallas and Vicki Childress contacted History Detectiv=
es about a device
that they won at an auction in 2003.  Bonnie Vent worked =
directly with
Vicki Childress in 2003 and wants to set the record straight =
that she
did not tell Vicki Childress as fact that Edison invented her devi=
ce or
that her device was used to speak to the dead.  In actuality the
rese=
arch done by History Detectives matches our research.

Here are some links of interest on the i=
ssues raised by PBS History
Detectives regarding the Psycho-phone.
Backgrou=
nd research photos of the Psycho-phone company and letters to
and from AB S=
aliger the actual inventor of Psycho-phone owned by Vicki
and Dallas Childr=
ess.  We have decided to come forward with our research
due to the now very=
 public information provided by History Detectives. 
We are happy to report=
 that their research matches ours and we can
provide this additional rare r=
esearch material from our files.

The ori=
ginal information provided on the Psycho-phone in 2002 that
clearly states =
the purpose of the device.  This also matches the
research done by History =
Detectives.

dparanormal.com/page/page/265918.htm>

The issue of Edison working on a dev=
ice is a separate issue and still
requires additional investigation.  Histo=
ry Detectives did provide some
of same information that you will find in ou=
r Edison White Paper.
