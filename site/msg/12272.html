Yes and successfully! EVPmaker, , water, chainsaw, sweep tuning, you name it LOL. I even have had a bit of live interaction while setting it up with thier suggested settings. I have a few posted over on my esnips along with other methods. Just look at list on left and click "more folders" to see the rest of the list of diff methods. Its in there.
