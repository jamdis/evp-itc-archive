<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce. Thanks for the info.  I was just wondering because of The Big Circle group, and 
how they often say the words &quot;Big Circle&quot; or &quot;Circle&quot; to identify themselves.  I too have 
gotten messages with &quot;Seven&quot; in it, but sometimes is hard to tell because I also get a lot 
with the word &quot;Heaven&quot; in it.  And LOL, for a while I had a &quot;Kevin&quot; coming through, which 
was REALLY throwing me for a loop!

&gt; Hi Margaret,
&gt;  
&gt; For a while all of the researchers here where getting numerous messages and answers
&gt; in reference to the words circle or circles, and the number seven.
&gt; It continued for a while sporadically and then stoped around the time the confusion with 
the techs started.
&gt;  
&gt; There are quite a few theories and schools of thought on the meaning of &quot;circles&quot; or 
&quot;seven&quot; in message content.
&gt; They have been thrown around and discussed often here over the last year.
&gt;  
&gt; I&#x27;ll try to find a couple of my files pertaining to these words and send them to you.
&gt;

&gt; Hi Kristin. Having a hard time making this out, but have a quick question for you. Are 
you getting messages with the word &quot;circle&quot; in them? Or hearing names that you don&#x27;t 
know??Margaret--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:&gt;&gt;
