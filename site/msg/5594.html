<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Interesting idea.  I somehow believe we are all connected and that we 
bring these &quot;spirits&quot; with us...we carry them continualy, somehow 
surrounded by them.  In the physical world, the only way we can try 
to wrap our brain around that idea is to think of them as 
being &quot;outside&quot; of us&quot; or &quot;around us&quot; as the box would make us 
believe; yet I am wondering if they are really &quot;within&quot; us in some 
way...perhaps that maybe your thoughts are not really all yours, but 
maybe a mixture of their thoughts and ours - collectively speaking.

If I freaked anybody, it&#x27;s early and I&#x27;m not awake this morning...

&gt; I was thinking tonight as Frank S. welcomed some of our new comers 
to 
&gt; the group if in fact anyone during a box session inquired to the 
names 
&gt; in which the other side call us?
&gt; 
&gt; For instance Frank has been addressed as princess, and I know I 
have 
&gt; gotten a spirit stating he was my brother (I am an only child).  I 
am 
&gt; curious as to whether or not this could in fact be affilated with a 
&gt; past or former life.  That at one time Frank S. could have been of 
&gt; royality and I could in fact have had siblings.
&gt; 
&gt; How far fetched is it that we could be actually talking to spirits 
we 
&gt; once had a relationship with or if that is even possible.
&gt; 
&gt; I would welcome any imput on my wild and crazy thoughts!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
