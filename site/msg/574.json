I use a natural white noise when I record \n&gt; and get good results. The water from the fishtank is pumped thru a \n&gt; charcoal filter creating a waterfall effect and the running water \n&gt; has always been a benefit to my sessions.\n&gt;\n&gt; However when using background sounds like water or music I \n&gt; usually find its best to not blast the sound and to turn the \n&gt; recording mic down halfway 50% loudness so it doesnt drown out the \n&gt; voices. I also find that most of the material is located within the \n&gt; recording at a much slower speed. For mine the more audible voices \n&gt; are usually located at -74 percent slowed (if using audacity to \n&gt; slow it) and sometimes at -30 when they have alot to get across.\n&gt;\n&gt; So try adjusting the sound volume and the recording mic volume \n&gt; and see if that helps. And dont forget to try slowing it down and \n&gt; listening to it in forward and reverse.\n&gt;\n&gt; Good luck!\n&gt; Misty\n\nSend instant messages to your online friends http://uk.messenger.yahoo.com \n\n\n         \n\n \n---------------------------------\nCheck out the all-new Yahoo!
