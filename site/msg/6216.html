<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This is interesting to me, Bruce. Everything I&#x27;m getting is coming  
through very fast and seems to come through at the faster sweep rate.  
I have to slow everything by about half to hear it clearly on  
playback. Are they pushing stuff through at the higher sweep because  
it&#x27;s more efficient for them to do it that way? Maybe they have to  
slow things down to get to anything to us to begin with. It makes  
sense if they are in a higher vibration than we are. Maybe the faster  
sweep is more sympathetic to them, albeit harder on us, for two-way  
communication.

I don&#x27;t think I made any real sense, but there you go...
