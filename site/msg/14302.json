So who knows what they&#39;re\nthinking?\n\nAs far as normal people who end up sticking around as ghosts in cemeteries,\nthat&#39;s an even bigger mystery. I think traumatic experiences, such as being\nkilled on a battlefield, can make you stick in that area. I was told by a\nScottish friend that there are still ghosts fighting the battle on the\nbattlefield portrayed in the movie Braveheart. That was over 700 years ago.\nNo one told them they&#39;re dead.\n\nZack\n\nOn Fri, May 15, 2009 at 10:47 AM, &lt;SnowfireL@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  It&#39;s amazing how these people that die, stay around in the same place\n&gt; they died, one would think they would be free of the sick physical body, go\n&gt; exploring, or look for loved ones, why do they want to hang around an empty\n&gt; old building?\n&gt;\n&gt;  In a message dated 5/15/2009 11:44:34 A.M.

The building is shaped like an &quot;H&quot; and our\n&gt; group of about 10 people was standing in one arm of the &quot;H&quot; looking through\n&gt; the windows to the opposite arm. We saw a shadow moving around inside the\n&gt; building in the other arm. We were just discussing this when a hoarse voice\n&gt; came in THREE times on the recording and said &quot;It&#39;s Harold Wing.&quot; This voice\n&gt; was not audible to our ears at the time of the investigation.\n&gt; Later on, one of the members of our group was able to access old records\n&gt; for the mental hospital and found there was indeed a patient named Harold\n&gt; Wing who died there of typhoid fever in 1936. There is no way any of us\n&gt; could&#39;ve known that at the time and it&#39;s doubtful anyone living would&#39;ve\n&gt; known about it at the time, either.\n&gt;\n&gt; Zack\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Fri, May 15, 2009 at 9:56 AM, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  Playing acrh skeptic, what value is a voice for survival evidence if you\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know who it is?
