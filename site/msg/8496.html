Rees,
 
If you like the 469 you will really like the 12-820.  Its a  joggers radio 
and it is smaller.  It has NO CLICKING on the am band and  has a nicer sweep on 
the fm  than the older 12-470's.  AGain  it  works the same as the 12-469 and 
you will need an external speaker  as the antenna.

I like the 12-469, and its super easy to hack.  I hacked the  20-125, its a 
little harder to hack, and most people in the form is going  to recommend this 
radio, but I just didn't like it.  It has a  long antenna and was hard to get 
reception.  
 
The 12-469 doesn't have a antenna on the outside, and what you do is  hold it 
in your hand.  Your body acts as the antenna, and that's how  I got my best 
reception.  But this is my opinion, go with your gut  feeling, if you get a 
radio you don't like just take it back to the  shack.  Act like nothing is wrong 
with it, and try the other  one.

I am looking at getting either the 12-469 or 20-125. Which would be  the best 
to get for someone who is just starting out. I will be doing  the Hack myself 
with a little help and instructions. I want to get  something fairly easy to 
hack and use for a beginner.
Thanks
