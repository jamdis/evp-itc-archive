<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I see two problems right off the bat:

1. As anyone who has been experimenting with these methods can tell
you, not all phrases and statements are heard exactly alike by each
person. That &quot;garbage&quot; as you call it can be a word heard by someone
else that does make since in the grander message.

2. By editing the message and guessing as to what the entity is trying
to say, you are in a since saying you know exactly what they meant in
their communication. It is better to ask for a clearer response to
your question than to mold the answer you get into an answer you want.

No matter how you argue this subject, I always hear more logical
arguments from those against the practice. I&#x27;m sure there are many
more points to be made as to why this is a bad idea but these are my
two big ones.

Regards,

Frank R.

&gt; Bruce    To add to what you said, the capacity of the yahoo forum we
are with does not permit long recordings and the messages we have been
receiving seem to be getting longer and longer each passing month. 
Not much room for the &quot;gargage.&quot;  I for one prefer to hear the
important message words, knowing full well the author edited the file.
 If someone wants to present false stuff so that he or she gets false
praise from us,  god bless them if they need the praise.  For
scientific research with original files...that&#x27;s another story.  Ron

&gt; Stefan, I do remove the &quot;garbage&quot; from my files. At this point in my
research, the message is more important to me than the proof of it.I
think most of us here will agree that we are receiving some sort of
paranormal communication.but it definitely exists. now we need to
concentrate on the messages they need us to hear and the answers to
the questionswe ask and in turn our answers to their questions. Anyone
that cleans a file in this way should not be touching any bit of the
filethat has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously
garbage like the &quot;EH O EH AH O EH UR&quot; in between words. For example
&quot;Is there anyone here that wishes to communicate_YES_AH ER EEH AR OOO
AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE&quot;It is much easier for me as a researcher
to be able to return to a file that I recieved two weeks ago and that
I believe may hold somerelivence to a message I just received and be
able to cleanly listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage
sounds. At this stage in real time communication the messages are the
top priority.I do however agree that the untouched version should be
retained and made available to individuals that make a request for any
intelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that may be made, and
god knows there are always fanatical sceptics lurking in the shadows
awaiting an opportunity to attack an unwary or injured researcher. I
do not think that our research files should be made available on
request by every tom dick and harry that is unknown to us and may
potentiallydoctor the file to suit their own point and post it as
such. I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the
researcher that receives the request for raw research data should
scrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment before
handing out any research data. These are my thoughts on the subject of
cleaning a file. Bruce

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi all,just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific
reasons, I wouldsuggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only
as a whole, inorder to rule out any possible suspicion of
manipulation. You can forinstance increase the volume or dynamics of
an entire clip (includingthe experimenter&#x27;s voice), filter or denoise
it to make it clearer, butnot cut out individual pieces (supposed
&quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP matchwith what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the
unedited version should alwaysbe provided along with the edited
version.But that&#x27;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to
express, aswe should always be able to present our results to a
critical public.Stefan-- &gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is
involved for these files.&gt; After my question, i isolate the response
section and slow that &gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually
start to hear the message &gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple
sections of just noise that &gt; don&#x27;t belong and eliminate them from the
mix. You can&#x27;t piece these &gt; files together to make something it&#x27;s
not, so i keep them in true &gt; form pretty much to the original.&gt;
