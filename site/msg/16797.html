<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with my &quot;Tom&#x27;s Tube&quot; ghostbox and getting some pretty good and clear messages for some two months now, but have yet to contact a &quot;Tech&quot; or &quot;MC&quot; of sorts.  Until last nights session, it always seemed as if just a big crowd of entities without a common adgenda, were crowding in and speaking whatever they wanted whenever they could, and leaving me with tons or random phrases, meaning nothing as a whole.
The last half of my session last night was different however.  I appear to have been &quot;DISCOVERED&quot; by a group on the other side who have given me the longest and clearest phrases yet and seem to be a bit more organized.  Below is a transcript which some of y&#x27;all might find interesting (and even a bit funny) The groupings in the same sequence
