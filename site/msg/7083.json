It has to do with being deserving of a Frank&#39;s box and  \n&gt; &gt; evidently!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well do I have to spell it out? Start putting some time into \nyour  \n&gt; &gt; research instead of\n&gt; &gt; taking tantrums and maybe someday you&#39;ll have a Frank&#39;s box, But \nI  \n&gt; &gt; doubt it!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; From: gjk1rrfan@...\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thu, 7 Feb 2008 19:21:50 -0600\n&gt; &gt; Subject: RE: [EVP-ITC] First Files from my new Frank&#39;s box #29\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; See what I meananother (MAN) gets the box, lol.geez.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Keep that to yourself please lol your good at what you do.
