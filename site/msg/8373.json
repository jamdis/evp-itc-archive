I just ran a test session by dropping the Speak Jet Allophones WAV into \nSoundSoap2.  I pressed play, then used my cursor to sweep back and forth through the \nfile.  I was essentially trying to replicate something similar to a manual radio sweep using \nthe tones.  I immediately received two direct, relevant responses to my questions, which \nreally surprised me!\n\nIn the first, I asked, &quot;How does this work?&quot; The reply is, &quot;I have to say the people are \ntalking, but I don&#39;t really care.&quot;  LOL - guess I&#39;ve been told.  ;0)\n\nIn the second, I asked for a name and was told, &quot;It&#39;s Patrick.&quot;  This really surprised me as \nPatrick (along with David and a female I have never been able to identify) is the name of \none of my tech helpers who speaks to me mostly through the MiniBox, but also has come \nthrough during radio sweeps. \n\nThe last message was a comment I don&#39;t quite understand, &quot;I&#39;m in contact with \n[counterfeits or counterbase.]&quot;  Whatever that means.\n\nAnyway, I thought I share this discovery about the SoundSoap2/allophones combo with \nthe group because it appears to also have potential for receiving communication, and I \nfigured some of you might want to try it as well.\n\nMargaret"}
