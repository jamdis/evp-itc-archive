Guy's
 
Do not give in to these demons that are trying to make a buck from=
 the research we love and the equipment we use.
 
I have given away includi=
ng the shipping 5 RS boxes for free, 4, 470's and 1 469 all hacked by me.
I=
 did not do it to gain popularity or even wanted a thank you. my sole motiv=
ation was to bring new people into the research and 
in turn change someone=
s life and perpetuate the idea of strength in numbers, in this case strengt=
h of communication.
 
To all new people on this board, do not patronise the=
se wolves that prey on the needs and wants of others. 
The RS 20 -125 is ev=
erything the 470 & 469 are and a little more. do not let the size or compli=
cated button arrangement scare you off.
the hack is as simple as the others=
. 
 
Do not buy any RS hacks from ebay, they are sold with the wrong energy=
 attached to them, spirit wise.
That is why I and all other researchers sho=
uld follow the example of a great man to whom we owe all of this research.
=
Mr. Frank Sumption, who was in a position at one time to make a substantial=
 amount of money from his boxes and
was offered the opportunity on a silver=
 platter. But chose to follow what had been asked of him by higher entities=
.
And that was to keep the research pure for research sake. And that at no =
time was this equipment or knowledge there of
to be for monetary gain.
 
I =
adhere to this promise made by Frank to our friends on the other side and f=
eel that there is no need to give in to these box 
extortionists. If a box =
is not attainable for a new person yet, the right way. Then it probably is =
not their time yet.
 
I have coined a phrase and believe in it. "The resear=
cher does not choose the box, the box chooses the researcher"
Be patient, t=
hose that do not yet have a box. We will do all we can to help you obtain o=
ne.
