<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah, now they call just about anything that uses a swept radio a 
Frank&#x27;s Box, but I guess I started it.

&gt; I started doing evp&#x27;s about a year ago. I use an Olympus digital 
&gt; recorder. I have had some luck. I was given a copy of Gold Wave 
recently 
&gt; and don&#x27;t know the program yet. I saw that someone offered up a 
link to 
&gt; a free tool but I could only find copies that cost.
&gt; 
&gt; About three weeks ago I had a friend over. He has a pretty 
successful 
&gt; investigative team in my area. One of his members brought 
the &#x27;Franks 
&gt; box&#x27; to show me since he knows of my interest in ITC. We didn&#x27;t use 
it 
&gt; however. They had among other instruments, a K-II emf meter. 
Actually 
&gt; they had about 3 meters of different types. I asked if he could use 
the 
&gt; box but he said he didn&#x27;t know it well enough yet to label anything 
&gt; paranormal. He did turn it on and there was a lot of noise and 
chatter.  
&gt; They did quit a few videos as well. The results were not that 
favorable 
&gt; with the video but the emf showed allot of activity. We were able 
to 
&gt; &#x27;communicate&#x27; using the K-II and asking yes - no questions. I don&#x27;t 
have 
&gt; the evp&#x27;s yet. I do have my own evp&#x27;s from my apartment but not 
from 
&gt; that night. I also have some from a couple cemeteries that I did. I 
like 
&gt; going out by myself which I guess is a big no no in the field of 
&gt; paranormal investigation but it hasn&#x27;t bothered me much at all.
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to get his friend to bring the box back over. I became 
&gt; interested in ITC about 11 years ago but never really involved 
myself 
&gt; into it. Someone took a picture of me in my kitchen. When the film 
was 
&gt; developed, a face appeared in the window behind me. There was no 
way a 
&gt; person could have been outside my apartment window. I started doing 
some 
&gt; research on line and that was how I found out about ITC and evp. A 
few 
&gt; years later I saw White Noise and my interest was sparked all over 
&gt; again. I have read about the &#x27;Brown box&#x27; and was really excited 
when my 
&gt; buddies friend brought over &#x27;Franks box&#x27;. With the popularity of 
all the 
&gt; paranormal shows and groups I have decided to concentrate on evp. I 
am 
&gt; now considered an &#x27;investigator in training&#x27; but my interest are 
purely 
&gt; personal.
&gt; 
&gt; I am assuming that you are the &#x27;Frank&#x27; of my friends &#x27;Frank&#x27;s box&#x27;. 
I 
&gt; was really surprised at the coincident when I joined this evp group 
to 
&gt; find out that it is your group.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope to learn allot from this group and thanks for having me as a 
member.

&gt; 
&gt; PS - I was considering moving to Florida but after reading all 
these 
&gt; &#x27;bog&#x27; post, I may move west.
