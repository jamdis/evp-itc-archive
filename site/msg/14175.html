This is why with digital photos, you can't enlarge them without loosing res=
olution. You can go smaller, but not larger.

When you enlarge a digital ph=
oto, the photo gets stretched, but the same amount of pixels have to now fi=
ll in, so they get larger, which magnifies the pixelation. You end up with =
a blocky "lo-res" image. You can choose to have it "resample", but then you=
 get what RJ described, where the program looks at the existing pixels and =
add pixels that are an average of the surrounding pixels. So you still end =
up what a grainy, digital looking picture.

When saving a photo to a compre=
ssed format, such as jpeg, you actually loose data, or pixels. The program =
decides which data to drop to make the file smaller. Each time you open and=
 resave, you loose more data.The resolution gets worse and worse.

This is =
the same thing that happens with audio files, you loose data each time you =
save it to a compressed format.

        Pixelization doesn'=
t clean-up the data: it replaces it.  Imagine taking a picture of a field o=
f flowers, and beginning to add levels or pixelization to the picture.  Soo=
n, you would not be able to tell there were flowers there at all.  You woul=
d see a lot of colored blocks.

        Or in the other direction, imagine =
you are looking at a competely randomize bunch of pixes on your screen: a c=
omplete screen of truely random static snow.  Pixelizing this, after a whil=
e, you would again start to see colored blocks.

        What's happening i=
s that it is processing an area of the image, taking (for instance) the ave=
rage value of that entire area, and replacing all the blocks in that area w=
ith the average.  In video processing, this would result in a field of mult=
i-colored flowers being replaced by, for instance, a big greyish-bluish blo=
ck, with no resemblance to flowers.  In the noise example, it maybe replace=
 all the random pixels with another big greyish-bluish block.  If you did n=
ot know beforehand what the original picture was, you couldn't tell whether=
 your pixelized image was really a field of flowers, a chevy, the sky with =
clouds, or a random bunch of pixels.

        It works the same with the so=
und files.  Taking something as complex as speech, and replacing frequencie=
s with their averages, loses the speech the farther you go, until you head =
strange fluctuating square waves.  Doing the same to random static will eve=
ntually produce the same thing.  And random fluctuating square waves can so=
und a bit like speech - or at least, you could have fun sharing with each o=
ther what you thing they 'sound like'.

                        Be =
a bit careful of formats like mp3 if you are doing a detailed analysis of t=
he sounds though.   While some formats (like wav) can store the audio very =
close to the way it was recorded, formats like mp3 compress the file, and i=
n so doing lose some of the sonic details.  This may not be a big deal in m=
usic, where the audio is fairly clear to begin with.  But with sound source=
s with a lot of noise (like evps), this can not only obscure any real sound=
s, but pixelize non-sounds (like white noise) and make them start to sound =
like speech.

                        So mp3 might be good for sharing the =
data, once you've already formed an opinion based on an analysis of the wav=
 file.  But mp3 is not good as a medium for analysis.  It can lead to many =
false positives and misinterpretations.
