I disconnect the\n&gt; &gt; processor board, after determining the function of the signals going to\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; radio board. You have to be able to turn on the radio itself with no\n&gt; &gt; processor board, then find the band change connection, the tuning voltage\n&gt; &gt; connection.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the first boxes I used tuner modules removed from car stereos, then\n&gt; &gt; after the hack was &quot;discovered&quot; I started using other radios, such as the\n&gt; &gt; Radio Shack models, but I would only use the radio board, and disgard the\n&gt; &gt; rest. I have used walkman style radios as well, again, disgarding the\n&gt; &gt; processor board. Usually there is a ribbon cable to the radio, you just\n&gt; &gt; have to determine what voltages are needed to operate the radio, and\n&gt; supply\n&gt; &gt; these from a power supply or voltage regulator.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I use Arm Band radios, Headphone radios, alarm clock radios that have\n&gt; &gt; digital tuning. I try to find radios that have a seperate tuner board.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So far radios that use a square chip seem to be software controled, so I\n&gt; &gt; avoid those. Not all digital radios are usable. The car tuners tend to be\n&gt; &gt; noisy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sometimes you can find the tuning voltage in a radio and just cut he\n&gt; &gt; connection, then insert an external tuning voltage from a sweep circuit.\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; have a Aiwa home stereo system that I made into a box using this method.\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s not portable, but it works well, it has the advantage of a built in\n&gt; &gt; tape recorder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; F-S\n&gt; &gt; On Tue, Sep 28, 2010 at 10:36 PM, Luis &lt;luispucp098@...&lt;luispucp098%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; One question Frank , its posible make a frank box whith an analogic\n&gt; radio\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ... its a problem make it here in Peru .
