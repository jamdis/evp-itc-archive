<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Zach, Everyone,

Almost forgot, I have the shack hacked hand-held radio with speaker. The hack is easy to undo.

&gt; Zach, I&#x27;ve got a list of stuff recently scavenged from a few closets and the basement. 
&gt; 
&gt; One radio shack mini amplifier, it has both an input and an output. 
&gt; 
&gt; One radio shack phone recorder mic, which I have ear marked for a parabolic microphone I&#x27;m making out of PVC pipe and a large potato chip bowl. I can spare the mic if we need to I&#x27;ll get another. 
&gt; 
&gt; A Belkin Tunecast II which is an FM transmitter. Can we transmit a voice with this  and would you sweep or use variable voltage tuning?   
&gt; 
&gt; An inductive probe used for wire tracing. I have the toner as well.
&gt; 
&gt; A polariod digital picture frame which the backlight on the LCD went out. But it has an SD memory card reader and speaker circuit. 
&gt; 
&gt; Tie-clip mic/mono earpiece for a cell phone
&gt; 
&gt; Few motion detectors, one of them is dual technology which IR and Microwave
&gt; 
&gt; a large number of RCA, mini plug, mini jack adapters and so on
&gt; 
&gt; Some 12v sirens and bells, enough to scare the crap out of someone
&gt; 
&gt; I bought a few small project boards, I have basic soldering tools.
&gt; 
&gt; I see some possibilities here. But I&#x27;m more interested in what you see, if anything. Could just be a pile of junk.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; On a separate topic, I heard of a satan box or something to that effect. Haven&#x27;t really seen anything but photos of it and a comment that people are afraid of it. Well I say that&#x27;s for me. I have more churches than  anything in my area, so I can get help if I need it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
