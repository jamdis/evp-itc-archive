Lots of food for thought here.\n\nI do not know for sure exactly who is communicating with us via Frank&#39;s \nboxes or what their intents are. This is a new mystery opened up by our \nnewer technology. It interested me that they make predictions that don&#39;t \nhappen, or in some cases seem to be lying.\n\nAbout 10-15 years ago quite a few people (myself included) built what we \ncall &quot;Barkhausen effect detectors&quot;. You can see the details at the \nwebsite below.  The Barkhausen detector starts about 1/3 of the way down \nthe page and goes to the bottom. A few of the parts are VERY difficult to \ncome by. The inventor sent me a couple extra pieces of his material used \nto make the coil core.\n\nhttp://amasci.com/freenrg/bark.html\n\nMost of us picked up voices on these things at one time or another.  Alas, \nneither I nor anyone else recorded them. We had no idea where the voices \nwere coming from.  Some people felt they were extraterrestrials.  It \nseemed odd that they spoke in Earth languages and usually the language of \nthe user, though.\n\nI still have the device around somewhere and might dig it out one of \nthese days (I think it&#39;s in the attic) and do some more experimentation \nwith it.\n\nZack\n\nOn Thu, 15 Nov 2007, juli velazquez wrote:\n\n&gt; Hey Zack:\n&gt;                    I have had the schematics for about 2 years now, but I am not mechanical inclined myself to build one.  I have strong convictions regarding the boxes, having been up close and personal (shall we say) on several different occasions.  I have analyzed EVP from many locations and still strongly believe that the box does not work for everyone.  I believe that your intentions are good giving our conversations in the past and wish you the very best with assembly.\n&gt;\n&gt;  See, I believe that the guilds know what your intentions are, and the sincerity behind your work and come through to those who have their best interest at heart.  I know that you probably think I am crazy, but in viewing some who currently posses the devices and having changed their path for their own agenda, its not going to be what they in vision it to be.  I think they could open Pandora Box and the world in which they know it will come crashing down upon their own accord.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I know the other side knows, and will help those in furthering their studies as they see fit.  I can only say, that the respect I have for the boxes and Frank will always remain, and I can lay my head upon my pillow at night with my integrity in take.  When I should have a box, I will know, and until then, I have the pleasure to listen and read everyones data and studies!\n&gt;\n&gt;  Juli\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Juli,\n&gt;\n&gt; Good to see you here!\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank has graciously provided the schematics and other data for building\n&gt; one. He also gave some info on modifications recently. We were\n&gt; discussing making a circuit board that uses small surface-mount parts. I\n&gt; can make boards that are far cheaper than ExpressPCB.\n&gt;\n&gt; Adjusting them is another matter. I have some of this work planned as\n&gt; &quot;winter projects&quot; when I can&#39;t get outside and do things. I am guessing\n&gt; learning how to adjust them properly is hard-won experience.\n&gt;\n&gt; I do agree they should not just be given to someone who has no idea how to\n&gt; use them. If I end up being able to make the boards easily, it would be\n&gt; just for this group. I wouldn&#39;t make any money at it, either.\n&gt;\n&gt; Zack\n&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, 15 Nov 2007, juli velazquez wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I agree! I rarely post, but as I just wrote Frank under separate cover, it is all about respect!\n&gt;&gt; Respect for Frank, respect for the unknown, and the pure intentions that must go along with the right of ownership!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I could have had a box build long ago, but I can honestly tell you that if it didn&#39;t come under Franks direction, or the directions of the guilds, then to me I shouldn&#39;t have one.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; See what the others fail to see is the true mean of messages conveyed from these devises. For the unknown to correspond these messages are of great importance, and not all people can not understand the depth in the meanings. I can only hope that they do not work for those who are not worthy, and that those who shall come in possession who are sincere will utilize it in all position manners never expecting personal gain!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Frank Ratka &lt;warrior18eii@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; I realize the time it takes to put things together. Especially units built from the ground up but if you are taking on the duty of spreading the technology to help mankind, to me it would be a labor of love. I can see and accept recovering production costs even, but this guy is looking to make a huge profit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You gained your respect and credibility on the fact that you have a system that works and you are willing to give it away when you didn&#39;t have to Frank. This guy is coming out of the gate with a cheap imitation of EVP maker and your system (both of which are free) and putting a huge price tag on it. It just don&#39;t sit right with me!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Honestly, I know it is none of my business what Ron does but I guess I just needed to register my protest with this seemingly blatant attempt at exploiting good though naive people.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Frank R.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  The contents of this eletronic correspondence is private & confidential and meant only for the party and/or parties it is addressed to.\n&gt;\n&gt;  No part of this email transmission may be publicly posted or forwarded to other parties without explicit written permission.\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
