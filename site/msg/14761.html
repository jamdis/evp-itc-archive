Exactly my point... You don't charge anything for the boxes
and Chris Moon =
charges people for using it....
If it's not perfected then Chris shouldn't =
charge either......
If he wasn't so public with it, then people like me wou=
ldn't dislike him
so much.
 
The only people that have your boxes (that the=
 public hear about)
are the well known paranormal groups and famous people.=

I am sure that you have given boxes to researchers who are not in the
popu=
lar
paranormal community ,and don't want to be. Those are the ones that
sho=
uld
get respect.  And of course YOU are well respected by us lowly
research=
ers. ( Kissin up , so you won't get mad)
 
And I am sure that you are sick =
of hearing about Chris Moon and how
alot of people thinks he sucks. And eve=
ryone wants a box......
But you have to expect that. You are the only one o=
ut there that is
honest and
doesn't want to be famous.
I know this is like =
beating a dead horse, so I will shut up now.... :)
