<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s a whole lot of IF&#x27;s, Michael, but IF all those things were to come together, it 
certainly would be a quandary as to whether or not approaching a complete stranger 
would be appropriate.  One can argue that the person in spirit has gone to great lengths 
to make contact with their loved one.  However.......

On the flip side, just because someone is in spirit, does not mean that they are 
automatically omniscient, nor that they have the right to impose their will (or you impose 
your will, for that matter) on a loved one who may not be open to the communication 
emotionally or spiritually.  

Assuming we are (as many indications have it) pretty much the same person in spirit that 
we were here in the physical (our personalities remain fairly in tact, though just as here, 
there can be growth and change on the other side), it would not be out of the realm of 
possibility for them to tell you their loved one is open to communication, when in fact they 
might not be.

I guess my bottom line is this:  There are so many people out there who are open to the 
idea of EVP communication and are seeking to make contact with their departed loved 
ones, that there is no need for approaching strangers with messages.  The potential for 
harm is just too great, and it is not our place (or the place of the person in spirit) to make 
these kind of decisions for others.  If this is what interests you (helping those in spirit to 
pass messages along), then seek to make connections with people in the physical who are 
openly and willingly on board your assistance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Margaret and other colleagues on this forum, if a proven process can be initiated, the 
information captured very clearly, and not faint, and it has to be clear that anyone 
listening will hear the words, and if the spirit can confirm the info we have before them to 
be accurate, and if the spirit can assure us that their loved one will not be offended, then 
would it be ok for us to proceed? And why not? &lt;&lt;&lt;

&gt; Thanks Margaret.
&gt;    
&gt;   If your vocation is a psychic in which patrons pay a known fee up front, and this 
physcic uses the box as an additional tool to get that icing on the cake, the actual voice, 
that I have no issues with. In every field there are crooks, so we can at best hope we are 
with a kind person when the meeting takes place.
&gt;    
&gt;   But if a person just goes out and buys a radio shack hack, and this is not their field, 
and they do get a message, if these individuals try and make money off the recipient of 
the message, that would in my book be terrible. The reason is that the spirit contacted 
the living to get help, and now that living person is ripping off their loved one for cash 
before they deliver the goods. If a spirit asks for help, we should do it for free.
&gt;    
&gt;   I write procedures for my company, and have been outlining a process to test with a 
willing spirit who wants to make contact  with their loved one.  
&gt;    
&gt;   So what would I or any of us need to make contact? Meaning if a spirit gave me &quot;John 
Smith&quot; of Norfolk, VA, confirmation would be a night mare at best. I would need to 
perhaps lay out a list of actuall addresses in that city and state to have the spirit tell me 
which one on my desk, on my list is the correct oerson, and then as you say how would 
this person respond to my call about my research and that a voice gave me their name and 
I have a recorded message for them?

&gt;    
&gt;   My plan is to set up a spirit profile along with on same page the loved one&#x27;s profile. But 
before I actually make contact, I want to be sure that who i am contacting is the real deal, 
and that they will not be offended. I have been laying out canned calls, for example, 
&quot;Hello, my name is xyz, and I am engaged in xxx research involving EVP. (Explain what 
that is), and a voice picked up on my recording gave me your name, and go from there. 
&gt;    
&gt;   Thinking out loud here, I would think that the sprit would know if their loved one 
would be in acceptance to me contacting them. 
&gt;    
&gt;   I am documenting everything step by step, and I do plan to attempt contact if I have 
the right info. I am thinking that I need to tweak my profile to get confirmation on 
whether the loved one would be in acceptance of me delivering the message.
&gt;    
&gt;   If there are any of you that have actually contacted a loved one you did not know that a 
spirit asked you to contact, please advise how you handled the first call.
&gt;    
&gt;   I know it may take me days, weeks, months and even perhaps years to get enough info 
on one profile to make contact, but I really want to do this and I want to perfect it, so 
others can become messengers for the deceased.

&gt;           Hi Michael. I have had the honor many times of either receiving messages for 
someone 
&gt; from their loved one and passing them on (to people I know) or in helping people learn 
to 
&gt; record for and receive their own messages. Along with research in trying to improve 
&gt; communication with the other side, this is my primary work with EVP... helping others 
who 
&gt; are grieving make contact with their loved ones. I do not charge for this.
&gt; 
&gt; I think to charge, or attempt to charge, anyone for a service (spiritual or otherwise) on 
the 
&gt; backend is slimy. However, if there is an agreement in advance about fees and services, 
&gt; then that is up to the consenting parties. People in all types of fields get paid for their 
&gt; time, regardless of the service being offered. If the fee is clear, the service being offered 
&gt; legitimate, so be it. As long as people aren&#x27;t being scammed. grrrr...... I don&#x27;t like to see 
&gt; people taken advantage of in any field of service (as one crooked auto mechanic tried to 
&gt; do recently with my mother.) Double grrrrrr........ 
&gt; 
&gt; As for figuring out who a message belongs to? I think we have to be very cautious in 
&gt; coming forward with content in recordings that were not requested by the living loved 
one 
&gt; of the person in spirit. It&#x27;s sort of like the doctor&#x27;s creed to first do no harm. I feel unless 
&gt; you know someone well enough to be fairly certain that your doing so would not 
&gt; traumatize them, you have to err on the side of caution and not say anything. 
&gt; 
&gt; For instance, there are some people who, due to their religious beliefs, could feel that 
you 
&gt; are being fooled by a demon or some other evil and that your saying you are in a touch 
&gt; with a loved one of theirs is not only not true, but cruel of you to claim so. Even worse, 
&gt; would be those who actually do believe you have heard from their loved one, but take 
that 
&gt; to mean they are not in &#x27;Heaven&#x27; (as some believe those in Heaven do not have the 
ability 
&gt; to communicate here.) There&#x27;s all kinds of beliefs which differ from our reality that our 
&gt; loved ones can be exactly where they are supposed to be, in a good place, and still talk 
to 
&gt; us via EVP. We have to make sure that there is a similarity in world views.
&gt; 
&gt; In regard to mediumship: Even as a experienced EVPer, and having made connections 
with 
&gt; my own loved ones, I still benefited from my sitting for an hour with a medium. One of 
&gt; the really neat things is, I brought my recorders and upon playback, can actually hear 
EVP 
&gt; that relates to what the medium is saying. So, as you wrote, that was icing on the cake. 
&gt; But the sitting alone, even without the EVP heard later, provided an explanation for 
events 
&gt; and a peace of mind to me about something I had carried with me for 25yrs and had not 
&gt; been able to resolve via EVP alone. The fee for that sitting was some of the best money 
&gt; I&#x27;ve ever spent in my life, as what I got from it was priceless.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I&#x27;d like to see some joint studies done with mediums and EVP, each modality 
&gt; helping to validate the other in the process. :-)

&gt; &gt; Amazing I take a weeks vacation and come back to 350 notes, and see this one.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Both of your arguments are indeed accurate. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But it is an added bonus to the recipient or customer to hear their loved one&#x27;s voice on 
&gt; tape rather that by word of mouth from a gifted clairaudient, clairvoyant, psychic 
person. 
&gt; That is the icing on the cake.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What would bother me terribly is if any of us researchers received a message from a 
&gt; spirit in which we could actually make contact with their loved one to send the tape, and 
&gt; then to try and charge the contactee for the recording. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In my opinion if any of us receive such a message with that clarity, we should 
&gt; send/give it to the contactee free of charge as doing so is in a sense a spiritual gift 
from 
&gt; the spirit to the contactee, and we are just the messenger. I have been researching this 
&gt; concept, and I myself hope to one day be able to receive clear and concise messages 
which 
&gt; would enable me to contact the spirit&#x27;s loved one to give them that message should they 
&gt; wish to receive it. And I gurantee you it will be free of charge. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Have any of you received on any occasion enough info from the spirits to be able to 
&gt; contact the loved one and give them the recording?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Margaret, I can&#x27;t argue with what you&#x27;ve said. I&#x27;m just saying 
&gt; &gt; there are those who take advantage and should have no business in 
&gt; &gt; doing so. One example I can give is Chris Moon. He charges people 
&gt; &gt; to do box sessions. I can&#x27;t remember the exact fee, but it&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; outrageous that he&#x27;s doing this, not to mention, he does so with a 
&gt; &gt; Frank&#x27;s box. He is a self proclaimed medium and I&#x27;ve heard from many 
&gt; &gt; sources that he is nothing but a fake. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; So I attribute my frustration with people of this type, but again I 
&gt; &gt; say, as long as there are people dumb enough to pay for this, then 
&gt; &gt; there will always be those who take advantage.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, I feel anyone who is gifted with mediumship or other 
&gt; &gt; advanced intuitive abilities should use it as a gift to help others, 
&gt; &gt; not for monetary gain.. I&#x27;m not being judgmental here, that&#x27;s just 
&gt; &gt; how I feel. I have a friend who is also a legitimate medium and I 
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t agree that she should use her abilities for gain, but it 
&gt; &gt; doesn&#x27;t mean I like her any less. My not liking it won&#x27;t change the 
&gt; &gt; fact that it happens, it&#x27;s just the way things go. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do I think that Ron is taking advantage of people? No I don&#x27;t. 
&gt; &gt; Ron says he uses the best parts available and that the cost of the 
&gt; &gt; Minibox is very close to what it costs to manufacture it. How close, 
&gt; &gt; I have no idea. On the other hand, I don&#x27;t own one as I think $399 
&gt; &gt; or $449 for the &quot;crystal enhanced version,&quot; is a lot to pay for a 
&gt; &gt; device that, from what I&#x27;ve heard, produces the same results as a 
&gt; &gt; Radio Shack radio for $25-$40.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Jeremy. If everyone knew about these support 
&gt; &gt; boards and that other resources are 
&gt; &gt; &gt; available to them, that would be one thing. Obviously everyone 
&gt; &gt; here is aware of that. But 
&gt; &gt; &gt; not everyone knows this place exists. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; And even if they do know about the boards here, how many would have 
&gt; &gt; the nerve to ask 
&gt; &gt; &gt; for help from strangers? As Bruce recently shared, he gives people 
&gt; &gt; invitations to contact 
&gt; &gt; &gt; him privately in case they are too shy just ask a question 
&gt; &gt; publicly. Which means, by the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; way, to some degree they have overcome some of that shyness in 
&gt; &gt; order to post whatever it 
&gt; &gt; &gt; was to begin with, which inspired him to make this offer. What if 
&gt; &gt; they don&#x27;t even have the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; gumption to be anything more than be a look-i-loo?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m guessing many people are just surfing the net, checking out 
&gt; &gt; paranormal stuff, and run 
&gt; &gt; &gt; across the hacked boxes for sale. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, I ask people who are taking the position you and Bruce are 
&gt; &gt; regarding profits ... do 
&gt; &gt; &gt; you have this same harsh sentiment toward Ron Ricketts, who makes 
&gt; &gt; and sells the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; MiniBoxes? I realize he is passionate about this research and 
&gt; &gt; helping others. Does that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; give him amnesty for making a profit? 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Personally I think we need to not be so judgmental. At what point 
&gt; &gt; does &quot;profitable gain in 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the paranormal field&quot; become &quot;sickening?&quot; I have a friend who is a 
&gt; &gt; medium. I mean THE 
&gt; &gt; &gt; REAL DEAL. He charges for his services. The fee is reasonable 
&gt; &gt; compared to many in his 
&gt; &gt; &gt; field. Does he do this because he&#x27;s a terrible person looking to 
&gt; &gt; take advantage of people? 
&gt; &gt; &gt; NO, he does so because he has been given a gift that changes 
&gt; &gt; people&#x27;s lives for the better. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; But he has to make a living.... has to support himself in some way. 
&gt; &gt; And because he has 
&gt; &gt; &gt; chosen to provide this service full time (and is not a trust fund 
&gt; &gt; baby), he makes a profit. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; This allows him to help far more people than he could if working 
&gt; &gt; some other kind of job 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and providing his services at no cost on the side. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I realize this is not exactly the same thing as gouging people on 
&gt; &gt; the price for a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; commercially available product, but making such blanket statements 
&gt; &gt; about profitability in 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the paranormal field being sickening is rather short-sighted, in my 
&gt; &gt; opinion. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a southern friend who likes to say, &quot;It&#x27;s a mighty thin 
&gt; &gt; plank that ain&#x27;t got two sides.&quot; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I just don&#x27;t think we have the right to claim that simply because 
&gt; &gt; someone is offering a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; good and or service for profit to consumers in the paranormal 
&gt; &gt; market, that this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; automatically means they are taking advantage of other&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; vulnerabilities. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; For Pete&#x27;s sake, no one is twisting the people&#x27;s arms to buy those 
&gt; &gt; units on eBay. They are 
&gt; &gt; &gt; perfectly free to buy from whatever source they choose. Since the 
&gt; &gt; units do work as 
&gt; &gt; &gt; claimed, we can argue that people have overpaid, shopped unwisely, 
&gt; &gt; or whatever. I assure 
&gt; &gt; &gt; you this happens every single day throughout the retail market 
&gt; &gt; place with all types of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; products and services. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I will say I have a fairly heathy dose of distain for 
&gt; &gt; charlatans/scam artists (of any flavor in 
&gt; &gt; &gt; any field) but that is not what we are talking about here. We are 
&gt; &gt; talking about people who 
&gt; &gt; &gt; are offering legitimate products to consumers. I&#x27;d rather see 
&gt; &gt; people doing this for profit, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; even when obscene, than running scams that damage people&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; physical, mental, and/or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; financial well-being.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do not give in to these demons that are trying to make a buck 
&gt; &gt; from the research we love 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the equipment we use.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have given away including the shipping 5 RS boxes for free, 4, 
&gt; &gt; 470&#x27;s and 1 469 all 
&gt; &gt; &gt; hacked by me.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did not do it to gain popularity or even wanted a thank you. my 
&gt; &gt; sole motivation was to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; bring new people into the research and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in turn change someones life and perpetuate the idea of strength 
&gt; &gt; in numbers, in this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; case strength of communication.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To all new people on this board, do not patronise these wolves 
&gt; &gt; that prey on the needs 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and wants of others. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The RS 20 -125 is everything the 470 &amp; 469 are and a little more. 
&gt; &gt; do not let the size or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; complicated button arrangement scare you off.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the hack is as simple as the others. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do not buy any RS hacks from ebay, they are sold with the wrong 
&gt; &gt; energy attached to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; them, spirit wise.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is why I and all other researchers should follow the example 
&gt; &gt; of a great man to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; whom we owe all of this research.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mr. Frank Sumption, who was in a position at one time to make a 
&gt; &gt; substantial amount of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; money from his boxes and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was offered the opportunity on a silver platter. But chose to 
&gt; &gt; follow what had been asked 
&gt; &gt; &gt; of him by higher entities.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And that was to keep the research pure for research sake. And 
&gt; &gt; that at no time was this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; equipment or knowledge there of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be for monetary gain.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I adhere to this promise made by Frank to our friends on the 
&gt; &gt; other side and feel that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; there is no need to give in to these box 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extortionists. . If a box is not attainable for a new person yet, 
&gt; &gt; the right way. Then it 
&gt; &gt; &gt; probably is not their time yet.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have coined a phrase and believe in it. &quot;The researcher does 
&gt; &gt; not choose the box, the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; box chooses the researcher&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Be patient, those that do not yet have a box. We will do all we 
&gt; &gt; can to help you obtain 
&gt; &gt; &gt; one.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No bodies at fault, but I would do the hack just to help more 
&gt; &gt; people get in this field. As 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bruce sayes the more people the better comunication we will have.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, all I can say is the market is driven by BUYERS. If people 
&gt; &gt; are willing to pay, you 
&gt; &gt; &gt; can&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fault the person selling for taking advantage of what the market 
&gt; &gt; will bear. Perhaps the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people who do not have the tools, or the skills, to do their own 
&gt; &gt; hack, feel this price is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reasonable?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This guy who sells on Ebay does get 55.00 a unit for them. He 
&gt; &gt; is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out f New 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; York. He originally wanted 129.00 for it. I was considering 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; posted a 12-469 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for 24.95 plus shipping and I will modify it for free or if 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyone wanted 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too I was going to post the instructions to modify one on the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same add just to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; screw with this guy. What do you thing?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On ebay I just saw a RS12-469 in a auction and the bid was 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; $49.95. I can&#x27;t 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe this shit that people try to pull off.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Holy shit! That&#x27;s insane! Well, if people are paying for 
&gt; &gt; it, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power to &#x27;em.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On ebay.de I saw one for €25 (about €40), what is still 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expensive for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such an old and low-quality device.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve been wanting to try the Raudive method with a 
&gt; &gt; germanium 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; diode.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Radio shack only carries silicon, so I&#x27;ll have to order the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; germanium
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and give it a shot.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You could also try a schottky diode which is more sensitive 
&gt; &gt; than a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; german diode. See: http://en.wikipedia german diogerman
