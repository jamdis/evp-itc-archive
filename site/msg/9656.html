&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bruce is correct that this group is founded on the belief the voices
&gt; &gt; do exist.... as to who is on the other end well even the people here
&gt; &gt; seem to have formed thier own ideas on that. Some based on beliefs
&gt; &gt; some based on research some based on instinct, some just thought it
&gt; &gt; up while watching a tv show that led them to join here. Others have
&gt; &gt; decided it doesnt matter who what when where why or how it is being
&gt; &gt; done, just the fact it is happening is enough to keep their  
&gt; interest.
&gt; &gt; Not everyone that joins here is a believer. But everyone that joins
&gt; &gt; here is curious and hopefully want to learn more.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have actually heard this question/idea stated before and
&gt; &gt; rementioned recently on a talk show dealing with ufo/government
&gt; &gt; technology. It was only mentioned as possibility and mentions of
&gt; &gt; conducted experiments that were used on people.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Look around you. The world as we see it is indeed a matrix, a peice
&gt; &gt; of a peice of a peice of a much larger puzzle. In my own ITC many do
&gt; &gt; not claim to be or ever have been a &quot;human&quot; some do not even have
&gt; &gt; names/labels until they are given one.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Nathan,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I suggest you read the headline and description of this group.
&gt; &gt; &gt; We are a group of real time communication researchers that are
&gt; &gt; &gt; continously seeking the truth. The founder of this board
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mr. Frank Sumption has alway&#x27;s made it clear that It is not a  
&gt; place
&gt; &gt; &gt; for sceptics and they will not be tolerated. We are here to study
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; further real time soirit communication, not have to defend every
&gt; &gt; post
&gt; &gt; &gt; we make or file we add. I suggest you take your negative
&gt; &gt; accusations and
&gt; &gt; &gt; detrimental unfounded criticism and scepticism somewhere else.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; You are wearing your welcome thin here, not to mention within 5
&gt; &gt; posts
&gt; &gt; &gt; you have contradicted yourself three times. and went from the
&gt; &gt; philosophy
&gt; &gt; &gt; of aliens enslaving human spirits to questioning any chance that
&gt; &gt; this method
&gt; &gt; &gt; of spirit communication could or does exist and is a conspiricy to
&gt; &gt; fool unsuspecting
&gt; &gt; &gt; people like us by means of a super transmitter.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have learned by experience to try and keep this type of post
&gt; &gt; civil, So for any moderators that are reading this

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nathan, I am amazed you would suggest or even think that! I live
&gt; &gt; in Cary, North Carolina and record when I have the time. There is no
&gt; &gt; set schedule, and when I turn my radio on and someone says hello
&gt; &gt; Michael, or even shouts out &quot;Mike Edwards&quot;, or a spirit tells me  
&gt; I am
&gt; &gt; holding a carving in my hand, who would even know I turned the radio
&gt; &gt; on? Only my wife knows I record, and we have kept this research from
&gt; &gt; our children as well as our neighbors. So you are suggesting that
&gt; &gt; Margaret, lets say who lives where I do not know, is playing a joke
&gt; &gt; on me with a high tech two way radio?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Nathan. I always look to relevance as a key in determining
&gt; &gt; whether or not something is appropriate to the session. If this were
&gt; &gt; a hoax, I would then have to seek an explanation for how private
&gt; &gt; information is known by the &#x27;hoax perp&#x27;, particularly information
&gt; &gt; that would require visual awareness. Some of us have examples of
&gt; &gt; appropriate responses being given when asking things like, &quot;Can you
&gt; &gt; name something nearby me?&quot; or &quot;Please tell me what I&#x27;m holding in my
&gt; &gt; left hand.&quot; A sophisticated multi-transmission two way radio would
&gt; &gt; not explain answers which require &#x27;visual&#x27; information of some kind
&gt; &gt; (though I&#x27;ll be the first to admit my understanding of  
&gt; electronics is
&gt; &gt; limited but I&#x27;m fairly confident on this aspect.) Of course,  
&gt; there is
&gt; &gt; always the chance that the person running the hoax is also, or in
&gt; &gt; partnership with, an extremely talented remote viewer or psychic who
&gt; &gt; is able to glean that visual information from the ether or the mind
&gt; &gt; of the experimenter. And what of those examples where people have
&gt; &gt; confirmed the sound of the voice being &quot;just like&quot; that of their
&gt; &gt; loved one in spirit? Surely the hoaxer isn&#x27;t also able to mimic
&gt; &gt; people&#x27;s loved ones.If you are using EVP Maker with anything other
&gt; &gt; than the allophones file, which contains no words to begin with, you
&gt; &gt; are also running the possibility of &#x27;false positives&#x27; albeit they
&gt; &gt; wouldn&#x27;t be from a hoax. Again, I look to relevance to be key, and
&gt; &gt; relevant info that would not come easily to a stranger is even
&gt; &gt; better. For example, I turned on my MiniBox for the very first time
&gt; &gt; and said, &quot;Hello?&quot; and immediately received the response, &quot;Hello
&gt; &gt; Margaret.&quot; If this were a hoax, how could that person know in less
&gt; &gt; than 10 seconds, who I was by name. I had not given this information
&gt; &gt; out. Not to mention that you have people experimenting 24/7 and
&gt; &gt; receiving similar responses. How in the world could an organization
&gt; &gt; have the manpower, technology, or even the desire, to attempt such a
&gt; &gt; hoax? I mean that as a genuine inquiry, because there might be an
&gt; &gt; explanation I have not thought of. I have one example where, via
&gt; &gt; radio sweep, my communicator was able to correctly identify the
&gt; &gt; status and location of a missing person (who it turns out was alive
&gt; &gt; and well, so we ended up with confirmation that the info given had
&gt; &gt; indeed been correct - which is much less complicated that trying to
&gt; &gt; track and understand the clues when associated with the dead, or
&gt; &gt; missing but not found.) Again, if a hoax, would that have simply  
&gt; been
&gt; &gt; a lucky guess on the part of the hoaxer?Bottom line for me is ...
&gt; &gt; have I wondered if it could be a hoax? Or simply a fortuitous tuning
&gt; &gt; of the dial? Yes, on both accounts. But there is enough compelling
&gt; &gt; evidence to rule out both of them as an explanation for the far too
&gt; &gt; many relevant examples received by so many of us.Good food for
&gt; &gt; thought, but after digesting it, I&#x27;d have to say, &quot;No, a
&gt; &gt; sophisticated hoax does not sufficiently explain the phenomena on a
&gt; &gt; large scale.&quot;Margaret--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Nathan Sharman
