<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I generally don&#x27;t like to listen to files that someone has already told me what to listen for (or has labeled the file), since that influences what you hear.  In this case, it sounds like quickly turning the AM dial up and down the dial, getting little snippets of broadcasts.  So it does not sound interesting to me beyond that.

&gt; That could be explained by you becoming practiced at  hearing what you want 
&gt; to hear in noise, regardless of the source of the  noise.

&gt; You know, I am hearing some  of the same voices on here, that I have 
&gt; received, the same fella says  the word, &quot;mercy.&quot; or is asking someone else for 
&gt; it. sf
