Dangers which Mankind faces if SPIRICOM is not used wisely\n&gt; \n&gt; Since his beginnings, Man has been faced with the fact that\n&gt; individually and collectively he has the power to act for good or\n&gt; evil. As his knowledge of the energetic nature of the cosmos has\n&gt; expanded, Man has found that every energy so far identified -- from\n&gt; sexual energy to atomic energy -- can be used for his benefit or for\n&gt; his downfall. He will find that the energies involved in SPIRICOM \nare\n&gt; also of a nature that can be used to help him grow mentally and\n&gt; spiritually and become more God-like (that is more like the beings \non\n&gt; the higher planes) or they can be focused on trivia which will make \nit\n&gt; even harder for him to grow out of the present deplorable mess in\n&gt; which Western civilization&#39;s social, economic and political actions\n&gt; are tending toward disintegration.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----------------\n&gt; \n&gt;     * For the spiritually oriented, we report some advice given by\n&gt; high level spirit communicators: If SPIRICOM researchers adhere to \nthe\n&gt; following procedure they will not suffer possession by negative\n&gt; forces. First thing in the morning say, &quot;I will wear the protective\n&gt; cloak of the Christ light until I retire tonight.&quot; On retiring make \na\n&gt; similar decree for the night hours. (Note: The Christ light is said \nto\n&gt; have overshadowed and inspired Jesus of Nazareth continually during\n&gt; the last three years of his earth life.)\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.worlditc.org/h_07_meek_spiri_082_089.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bryan_whatley&quot; &lt;bryan_whatley@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This sounds pretty interesting.

And yes that&#39;s a trifield meter \nbuilt in.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  It seems to work great.  Once the meter shows any EMF field at \nall\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the box starts to spit out the allophones.  The meter also has \na very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sensitive antenna and it is tied together with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  A to D converter antenna that I use to get the emf into the \nbox.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is by far the most sensitive of the three boxes.  If you \nare\n&gt; &gt; &gt; building your own just let me know if you need any info.  I \nwill of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; course upload audio files as I get them.  I did have a few \nheadaches\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with this box as I am driving the LM386 all the way up.  \nSomehow the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; audio was getting back into the negative bus!  Took a couple \nhours to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get the right capacitor for the ground shunt.  Funny though as \nit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worked great on the breadboard but once I soldered it together\n&gt; &gt; &gt; UHHHGGG.  I think I will hang onto this one  for a while.  I \nhave\n&gt; &gt; &gt; young lady in mind that is doing very promising work so I guess \nshe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gets box # 1.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
