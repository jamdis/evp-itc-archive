I took the Mini to the Mezzanine because I had seen an\napparition of a man in a dark suit there -- he kept walking up to me\nand standing next to me, then vanishing.  But I did not hear anything\nobvious via the box there.  The basement was the best.  There is a lot\ngoing on in that theater.\n\nRosemary\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I know some people who got a VIDEO of One-Armed Red a few years ago\nin the \n&gt; basement. He walked across the room, plainly in view (well, you\ncould see \n&gt; the shape but no features).\n&gt; \n&gt; Zack\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, 30 Jun 2008, rosemary_guiley wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Folks,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Recently I did an investigation at the Lincoln Theater in Decatur, IL\n&gt; &gt; with my Mini-Box, and got some interesting clips from the basement\n&gt; &gt; area.  The files are too large to be uploaded to the forum here, but a\n&gt; &gt; short video with the audio clips has been posted on You Tube by Joey\n&gt; &gt; Tito, a Chicago researcher who filmed the investigation.  The audio\n&gt; &gt; clips are at the end, and Joey matched them to a transcript of what I\n&gt; &gt; picked up.  I sent the clips to Frank, and he picked up even more.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The You Tube link is www.youtube.com/xflexx1  Joey has a short version\n&gt; &gt; and a long version; pick the short one.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have a report on the investigation posted on my blog on MySpace at\n&gt; &gt; www.myspace.com/rosemaryellenguiley  and Joey&#39;s video is on my home\n&gt; &gt; page there as well.  The blog also has my report on a similar\n&gt; &gt; investigation at Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield; the clips from\n&gt; &gt; that are posted on this forum in my folder.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Rosemary\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
