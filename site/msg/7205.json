If everybody \nhears something different, than who&#39;s right?  I post what i think i \nhear and than when others hear something else, i can hear that too.  \nWhy didn&#39;t i hear it the first time?  Also, until a clearer format \nbecomes available to our spirit friends we will forge ahead with what \nwe have.  It&#39;s very frustrating to say the least, i don&#39;t hear what \nothers hear and they don&#39;t hear what i do.  It&#39;s a giant circle of \nconfusion and mis-understanding.  Maybe it&#39;s just radio gibberish, when \nset at a certain speed makes our mind wander...who know&#39;s...right??\n\n-Steve H."}
