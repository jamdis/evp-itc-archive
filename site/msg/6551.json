I don&#39;t know the \n&gt; technical aspects of the file \n&gt; &gt; change but I think it&#39;s common sense that when you try to pour a \n&gt; gallon of water into a shot glass\n&gt; &gt; all you wind up with is a shot glass full of water the rest is \n&gt; spilled and lost.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I keep my files posted for 5 or less days, just long enough for \n&gt; anyone that wants to listen can.\n&gt; &gt; If your going to leave your files posted indefinitely and keep \n&gt; adding to the folder then of course it will\n&gt; &gt; put pressure on the storage space.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As far as posting a notice for every file, some of us may wish to \n&gt; listen from their e-mail or not \n&gt; &gt; have to go to the file section to listen, That&#39;s probably why \nthat \n&gt; option is given.\n&gt; &gt; If I didn&#39;t like the notices cluttering up my e-mail in box you \ncan \n&gt; change that feature in the group\n&gt; &gt; membership options.

One solution is to post Mp3 files instead \nof \n&gt; Wav. files or any other format. It seems like the Mp3&#39;s sound the \n&gt; same and are only 1/10th of the size.

If i actually have \nmore \n&gt; than a couple files from here on out, i will be attaching them to \nan \n&gt; e-mail and not the board to save space here. And also, if people do \n&gt; post files maybe we can all just have one post that says we have \n&gt; uploaded files to our folder instead of 30 audio announcements in a \n&gt; row that just seems to waste a lot of e-mail space in the \nindividual \n&gt; e-mails.
