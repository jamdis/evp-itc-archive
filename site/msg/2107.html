<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>To try and rule out that the EVP researchers are imprinting voices 
psychokinetically on audio players mistaken as ghosts voices, I will 
pre-tape an interactive evp session.

 
I will record a bank of thirty questions, 20 seconds of silence 
after each question, on a cassete tape and played on a cassette 
player that will be utilized in all three buildings in a known 
haunted location just outside of Phoenix, Arizona.

There will be digital recorders, cassette recorders, omni 
directional microphones, condensor microphones, as well as an 
electrocet boom microphone present in all of the sessions. There 
will be no human agents in the buildings when these sessions take 
place.

My hope is to:

Record an authentic EVP with no human agent in the building. 

If this is phenomena driven, will the phenomena communicate by 
responding to questions from a machine rather than a human agent? 

If you have any ideas to enhance this experiment, please feel free 
to let me know. This experiment will take place on October 27th.
