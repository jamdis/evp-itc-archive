They often will suggest settings for software or filters or methods to use to record or even times when they will be more active. I just dont always understand what they mean until it smacks me in the face later LOL I am not a technical type person so I find myself using google alot to look words/subjects up that make no sense to me. Even then I am just feeling my way around in the dark when it comes to the how or the why. I dont ask how or why anymore I just focus more on the &quot;who/what&quot;. No matter the method I get the same group of talkers (+/- the strangers who pop in to say hello).\n\nMisty\n\n\n--- On Sun, 8/31/08, threadsintyme@... &lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; From: threadsintyme@... &lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] DRV - Direct Radio Voice recordings\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, August 31, 2008, 9:26 AM\n&gt; Hi Misty,\n&gt; Thank YOU for the simple, concise explanation. It appears\n&gt; that whoever or whatever is &quot;controlling&quot; the\n&gt; sessions on the other side, they seem to be helping organize\n&gt; the best method of recording by each individual who is\n&gt; recording. It almost seems as if there were some sort of\n&gt; organized effort to help, doesn&#39;t it? :) \n&gt; Al\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Al\n&gt; Franks box sweeps the band either linear or random and\n&gt; grabs snippets of stations and for me is much louder\n&gt; fragments of speech that I often hear live as I record. With\n&gt; this its just on no station, recording what sounds like\n&gt; nothing or the occasional buzz whoosh that comes thru. Frank\n&gt; will have to be the one to explain the difference in detail\n&gt; he knows alot more about the subject when it comes to how\n&gt; his box functions.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know some have had loud conversations using DRV I think\n&gt; theres even a youtube video of someone doing that. But I did\n&gt; not hear them like a broadcast the way they did, I didnt\n&gt; hear them at all until I played it back and was surprised to\n&gt; hear our names and speaking directly to me or my friend. Its\n&gt; interesting. It would be nice to get to that level of\n&gt; clarity that some claim to have had. I do believe the\n&gt; possibility exists to expand in many areas and this will\n&gt; just be one more I will be adding to my agenda.\n&gt; \n&gt; Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 8/30/08, threadsintyme@...\n&gt; &lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: threadsintyme@...\n&gt; &lt;Threadsintyme@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] DRV - Direct Radio Voice\n&gt; recordings\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Saturday, August 30, 2008, 9:46 PM\n&gt; &gt; I was wondering what the difference between the DRV\n&gt; sessions\n&gt; &gt; and a recording made through the &quot;Frank&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; Box&quot;, or any other box might be? \n&gt; &gt; Thank YOU!\n&gt; &gt; Al\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- &quot;Misty&quot; &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I did a DRV session last night and I just wanted to\n&gt; share\n&gt; &gt; some of the \n&gt; &gt; results with the group. They came thru quite clearly\n&gt; even\n&gt; &gt; tho they had \n&gt; &gt; some difficulty making the link to where I was tuned\n&gt; off\n&gt; &gt; station in \n&gt; &gt; the &quot;dead&quot; zone. I usually start and end my\n&gt; sweep\n&gt; &gt; sessions off station \n&gt; &gt; but they had been coming thru quite clear there so\n&gt; last\n&gt; &gt; night I did the \n&gt; &gt; entire session that way.
