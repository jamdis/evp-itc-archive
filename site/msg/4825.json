I would like to get a series of  \n&gt; questions together and have everyone with the same box&#39;s do a  \n&gt; session at the same time using these questions.\n\nMight be interested. I&#39;m game.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It would be interesting to see what we all get as well as if some  \n&gt; of the same voices come through for all of us.\n&gt;\n&gt; I know I have heard Steve come through when we were doing a session  \n&gt; at the same time, and his and Bruces tecs voices have been verified  \n&gt; by them and have come through to verify things if I had a problem  \n&gt; during my sessions.\n\nWhen you say this--you&#39;re referring to Steve&#39;s technicians or guides  \nor whatever you want to call his regulars, right? Or is this a spirit  \nSteve?\n\nI&#39;ve been steadily hearing &quot;Seven,&quot; &quot;Lisa,&quot; &quot;Rick,&quot; and &quot;Steve&quot; on my  \nend. Today I heard from someone named Charlotte twice.\n\nAnn"}
