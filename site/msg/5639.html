<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>For the last day or so I have been having activity at my home.  This is 
really not uncommon, for it seems I have some spirits who like to visit 
every now and again.  I decided to ask some questions during my session 
why this spirit was here and if in fact the tec&#x27;s could bring him home 
or send &quot;Collectors&quot; to cross them into the light.

The questions and responses are posted in the file &quot;Earth Bound 
Spirits&quot;.  Some of the the files may be long in lenght, but I wanted 
you to hear the conversation back and forth where several spirits are 
talking and responding all together.  

Steve H. had a previous experience and had an opportunity to assist in 
crossing a so called Earth Bound Spirit over.  If in fact this is 
actually possible, this could be huge regarding our research as well as 
service an additional purpose behind our gifts to communicate.

Thanks!
