On the site of paranormal systems it give you an email that is Ron Ricketts email.  He told me that he builds the boxes one by one on his own when you place the order and it takes 5 to 10 day to receive the Mini box.  Kay, and I both are buying  a Crystal enhance Mini-Box with a two year warranty.  I can't wait till I get mine.
