Your right Frank, it all depends on expectations and what degree of proof i=
t will take for someone to accept the existence of the beyond and the entit=
ies who reside there. People all over the world scream for proof but yet if=
 you ask them they cannot define what criteria they require for proof. Why?=
 Because they are so brainwashed in our societies materialistic teachings t=
hey never expect to receive proof, so they don't even bother to define such=
 a criteria.

Its amazing to me that a primarily spiritual creature such as=
 ourselves can deny our connections with that world and the source. The con=
nections we experience everyday and at all times in the form of dreams, ran=
dom thoughts and inspirations are so easily taken for granted and written o=
ff as figments of imagination, trivial thoughts and meaningless aspirations=
. Even as a child I knew I was unique as was every person on the face of th=
e planet. I knew that their were as many perspectives of reality as their w=
ere people to have them and that each and every one of them were just as va=
lid as the other no matter how outlandish it seemed to me.

Acceptance was =
taught to me instead of beliefs. Beliefs can enhance the truth but they are=
 not in themselves true.

More than I expected to write but I feel it is st=
ill valid,

Best regards,

Frank R.

I know how hard it i=
