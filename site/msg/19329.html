<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Don&#x27;t know if you have heard of this guy, but John Oates has made a living
claiming that reverse speech messages are the one way the unconscious cannot
lie.  He also claims that reverse speech messages are almost always linked
to the forward speech message.

Some of his examples are quite intriguing, but I don&#x27;t buy it fully yet.  I
have recorded my own voice and played it backwards and got zilch.

But, if there is some truth to it, maybe we should all be reversing some of
our files from time to time just in case.  Wouldn&#x27;t it be a startling find
to have this be true not only of the living, but also in those who
communicate through the box a well.
