<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks for the clarification, Bruce.  I&#x27;ll let y&#x27;all know if I hear anything.  The only thing I&#x27;ve 
received that is even remotely close is, I was recently told one night that Patrick wasn&#x27;t 
there, and when I asked where he was, I was told, &quot;Not his schedule.&quot;  Which I thought was 
a pretty interesting comment.

&gt; Hi Margaret,
&gt;  
&gt; What I meant was, through all of us doing research, someone or a number of us are 
bound to receive
&gt; a message or messages that will explain what and if there is an explanation for the tech 
turmoil some
&gt; have been experiencing including myself. And that the answers and or messages will 
most likely be recorded 
&gt; by the researchers so we can collaborate them and come up with a generally accepted 
theory.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Bruce. The reason I asked about the techs is, my normal guys are David &amp; Patrick, 
and a woman whose name I&#x27;ve never been told. They come through on the MiniBox or 
manual radio sweep. It seems I have a different tech group (five people) when I work with 
more traditional EVP methods, which I discovered nearly three years ago. I thought it 
interesting to have someone named Arthur come through via EVPM, as the name is new to 
me. I&#x27;ve long suspected that perhaps different groups assist with different technologies. 
For instance, I have one team that seems to be unique to my work with light 
(phototransistor modified recorder and battery operated plasma globe combo.)I&#x27;m not 
sure what you mean by &quot;come up with the answer, backed up by a file.&quot; Margaret--- In

Margaret,&gt; &gt; I have had the same two techs since I began this research.&gt; Mike and Lisa, 
we built a very strong and trusting relationship.&gt; Within about the last month I have 
hardly heard from mike and received &gt; numerous message that lead ME to believe he has 
moved on, either to&gt; help less experienced researchers or to a higher spiritual level.&gt; &gt; 
There is definitely a restructuring of the techs and guides going on.&gt; I am not the only 
researcher experiencing this phenomenon.&gt; &gt; I still however receive messages from Lisa 
in every box session.&gt; To answer your original question, given the fact that I have only 
done 2 EVPM sessions &gt; No I have not received any conformation of either of my techs, 
and of course with the &gt; nature of the robotic sound that the EVPM file omits, 
Recognisable voice tones or patterns&gt; are not possible.&gt; &gt; But the experiments continue, 
and hopefully one of us will come up with the answer, backed&gt; up by a file.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt;

All. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else has received a &#x27;tech&#x27; or &#x27;helper&#x27; name(s) while using EVP 
Maker?Just thought I&#x27;d toss this out there.... Last night I asked who was speaking using 
the EVP Maker and SJ Allophones combo, and received the direct answer, &quot;Arthur.&quot; That&#x27;s a 
bit short for my preference, as I like to rule out coincidence, but there was a followup 
statement made in the same session which surprised me, &quot;Arthur can help you.&quot; I think 
when using sweep and similar techniques that relevance to session content is really 
important as an aid in ruling our false positives, so this followup comment helped sway 
me toward the possibility of this having been intentional communication. It&#x27;s been 
fascinating to work with this combination the last couple of days!Margaret &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
