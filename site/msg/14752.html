To Add:

To me being present when it happened, these taps sounded like brea=
ker switches-you know when you overload the circuits in your home and one o=
f the switches in the electrical panel will trip? That is what it sounded l=
ike. A sharp, semi metallic snap.

This is why I thought maybe it could be =
faulty breakers, though no switches were actually switched. It could be, as=
 someone suggested earlier some electrical apparatus in the home making the=
 noise every time there is a surge. I did try and track it down, but could =
not find the source. I have a sleep number bed. Every time anything goes on=
 with the power, it makes a noise-though not like this.

  There is absolutely no evidence pointing towards PK phenomena. The=
 homeowners were not present during the investigation. These surges can eas=
ily be explained as mundane and therefore we must assume it is. If we can't=
 rule out all mundane sources, then we have to assume it is not paranormal.=


  These were electrical surges. The only time we had EMF spikes was when =
these taps would be heard. The meter would spike, and then immediately retu=
rn to 0.

  "Do your readings in your notes? Were you reading electrical or=
 magnetic
  fields? What type of EMF meter were you using?"

  Yes we logge=
d all readings. We were reading EMF, so a bit of both. We had several types=
 of meters present. At one point, we had 2 KII meters a few feet apart in t=
he living room. On some taps, one would go off, and others, the other one w=
ould go off. Most spikes fell in the 2.5 mg range, but a couple went off th=
e scale.

  It also explains some of the other activity the homeowners comp=
lained about-the touch lamp, kitchen lights dimming, etc.

  Again, these s=
urges were constant, though not uniform.

    What I have been hearing on this since the first posting is a sing=
le
    tap that sounds like wood on wood. Since the tapping was continual
 =
   and you noticed an EM spike there is another possibility.

    You could=
 have detected a PK event. In poltergeist cases we have come
    to realize=
 that living PK agents often are responsible. These agents
    function in =
environments with specific characteristics and themselves
    exhibit speci=
fic traits. One of the environmental characteristics is
    an elevated mag=
netic field. Often this is a geomagnetic field as seems
    to be the case =
in extreme poltergeist cases. Less extremem cases, 
    such as this may be=
, we often see elevated EM field levels. Do your
    readings in your notes=
? Were you reading electrical or magnetic
    fields? What type of EMF mete=
r were you using? This might help
    determine if the info you noticed was=
 potentially related to PK
    effects.
