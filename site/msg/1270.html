<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just a quick note to state I&#x27;m reading this thread with great 
interest. It&#x27;s just this type of innovative thinking that can result 
in breakthroughs. I wonder if Tesla is watching?

&gt; when i coined the term superresonance i didnt know about 
superresonant black holes.  its not related to that.  the main thing 
is, its repeatable
&gt;    
&gt;   theres no doubt about mechanism.  its squeezing a mixture of 
quantum noise, thermal noise and signal so it stays &quot;squoze&quot; and 
emerges into the real world where it doesnt really belong.  
alternatively, it is mathematically the equivilant of welding scalars 
into vectors -although that is not a good description of actual 
process; alternative 2: precision virtual state engineering.
&gt;    
&gt;   as transistors get smaller and faster, pure quantum oddities and 
breakovers are going to be a big problem.  state of the art is almost 
there right now;  if you can suck the quantum zoo-animals into the 
real world, you can also force them out of your quantum well 
computer. you can be a real bully :)
&gt;    
&gt;   the significance is that it is no longer haphazard, relying on 
luck and a stiff tail wind and planet jupiter being in the right 
place.  it can be repeated at will, though with difficulty; i have 
two black eyes right now from concentrating too hard for too many 
hours .  
&gt; 
&gt;   thats why people are reluctant to try .  the reason the nearly 
obsolete mrf 571 works where better transistors dont is that it 
cannot handle much power, which is why it heats and cools quicker 
than the latest ones.  the whole process of getting it to work would 
take weeks instead of hours with any comparable microwave transistor

&gt; &gt; when the mrf571 transistor is biased BEYOND its
&gt; &gt; maximum sensitivity, white noise starts spilling
&gt; &gt; across the PN junction. careful adjustment for
&gt; &gt; resonance- which is ulcer producing and takes
&gt; &gt; several hours- causes the noise to abruptly
&gt; &gt; disappear as it becomes incorporated into a signal. 
&gt; &gt; it is possible to wash inert objects , chemicals
&gt; &gt; -even a photograph- with the noise from the
&gt; &gt; exploring wire and retrieve or broadcast the
&gt; &gt; reemitted , ultraweak microwave signature- besides
&gt; &gt; getting voice which is so-far too weak to be
&gt; &gt; intelligible or amplifiable. the noise generators
&gt; &gt; and hissing tape recorders are a clumsy, indirect
&gt; &gt; wayof doing this same thing. by superresonance it
&gt; &gt; will probably be possible, eventually, to transmit
&gt; &gt; electrical power from place to place AROUND
&gt; &gt; space-time.
&gt; 
&gt; what do you imagine that mechanism is?
&gt; quantum wormholes or some such?
&gt; I like this superresonance concept but only find it
&gt; associated with black holes in the lit, but am anxious
&gt; to see how you&#x27;ve been continuing to develop this
&gt; thread. I think it has reader appeal once we can give
&gt; it more context. Anyway, it appeals to me.
