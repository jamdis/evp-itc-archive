Please help keep it more \norganized so that people have an easier time locating your files. \n\n*When uploading use one folder with your name on it to upload to. You \ncan make as many subfolders in it as you wish.\n\n*For sound files please use etiquette and convert your files to mp3 or \nsomething that is a smaller file size so that others in the future will \nhave some room to share thier files too. Some of us also use Esnips.com \nto upload files to share with everyone. They give you 50 gigs and you \ncan upload any file types you wish and size limitations are no longer \nsuch a problem.You can easily make your link available to everyone in \nthe group by adding one link to your esnips account in the &quot;Links&quot; \nsection of our group forum and adding it to your posts.\n\nIf you can correct some of this yourself please do. It will look better \nthan me having to do it down the road when the files section gets full.\n\nThanks everyone!\nMisty"}
