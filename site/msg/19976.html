That's incredibly clear, Frank. 
=C2=A0
I get names all the time, but it's =
always the same ones...mine, yours, SH, the names of my son and his momma, =
close friends, my guides and family members/ancestors. 
=C2=A0
They still s=
ay "Frank" & "Frank Sumption" (etc) in at least=C2=A07 out of 10 sessions I=
 do, hahaha. 
=C2=A0
I just got one of those FLIP HD cams on Hultay's recom=
mendation about=C2=A02 weeks ago. The first test capture I did was just mes=
sing around with a box and checking the lighting...all of a sudden everythi=
ng stops and a voice says, "Hello, Frank!". 
=C2=A0
Immediately after that =
I panned over to my FB #60 & FB#82 and the same voice shouted, "Frank's Box=
!"...
=C2=A0
It even happens when I just turn them on to check my batteries=
... they'll pop off with something about you or Hultay, but only on the box=
es you and Steve built....?!?!
=C2=A0
It's really=C2=A0strange and occurs e=
nough that it's convinced me there's still SOMETHING to all of this stuff. =
I guess I needed it; half the time I think you guys are totally nuts, lol. =

=C2=A0
