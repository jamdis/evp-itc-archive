L.M.O.&quot; OMG, he used internet \nslang!\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m beautiful?\n&gt; &quot;And dumb. But you love (me).&quot; The last word is very faint.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m in what? (still having trouble catching everything real-time)\n&gt; &quot;L.A. Tech City&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I heard you say the portals are open. What&#39;s a portal? (Heard in a previous session.)\n&gt; &quot;They open and you humans talk for the interview portals.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The portal is used for what?\n&gt; &quot;Help you enter our air.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; To enter your air? Or your territory?\n&gt; &quot;Air [groupie?] doubles air access. Air, I told you helps talk.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The portal takes us to you?\n&gt; &quot;Our elderly therapist, Arthur.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you call our stations? If your stations are called an Air Port, what are ours \ncalled?\n&gt; &quot;Air Portal U.F.O.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Where am I? In your frame of reference, where am I?\n&gt; &quot;You&#39;re here.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m gonna listen again. Thanks Arthur.\n&gt; &quot;I tell them hold access for you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh. One quick question. How do you close the portal?\n&gt; &quot;You don&#39;t ever have to stop it. That helps out. I hold the answer. I have the air.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OK, I&#39;m gonna listen.\n&gt; &quot;Elders help. They&#39;ll give you air to us.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \nhttp://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/EEvzRykjU9np1nHk3TATGSMdSMqARuGFIoOHQo9MEYppWs\n&gt; AZ482J0vg9cTefj_t33eDz7M9h-\n&gt; \nBzIYXrP6KGnFGKC5LPtjNlOahksIg/Margaret%20Downey/SJ%20Allophones/PortalsConvo.m\n&gt; p3\n&gt;"}
