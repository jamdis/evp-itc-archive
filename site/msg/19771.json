At at 54&quot; right after Steve said &quot;this is my antenna&quot;, I heard in French &quot;Don&#39;t leave!&quot; (&quot;Ne quitte pas!&quot;)  And when Steve switched to AM linear sweep at 1:28, I heard &quot;Who is this?&quot; (&quot;Qui est-ce?&quot;)\n\nGood vid, Steve; thanks for sharing it.\n\nSharon from SF\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Tim Woolworth &lt;tjwoolworth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Interesting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you speak French Steve?  A woman was speaking it during the clip starting\n&gt; at .41 seconds.  Are there any French radio stations down that way?  What I\n&gt; find interesting is that she is speaking French and man is agreeing with her\n&gt; in English.  It may be radio broadcast because of the clarity, but I would\n&gt; think a translator would be speaking for her since only the Bayou and Quebec\n&gt; use French here in North America.\n&gt; \n&gt; My French is really rusty, but I think she is saying:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;D&#39;accord.  En vous etait parlons a l&#39;etre (yes)  te t&#39;aller....&quot; and I\n&gt; can&#39;t quite make out the rest.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I agree.  What you are talking about is the being (yes).
