<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s just my own experience, but there seems to almost infinite 
levels of existence, probably not all spirit, some are called 
etheric, or astral beings. I got into this because the voices are 
extrmemly intriguing to me, and I don&#x27;t what they claim to be as long 
as they talk. 

 The 820 looks very easy to hack, there is a flat wire bundle fromthe 
clock board(it has the clock display) to the radio board, on the 
board the wires are marked, just cut the one that says &quot;mute&quot;. That&#x27;s 
all there is to it. 

 I&#x27;m using the 820 as the tuner module in a box, instead of doing the 
hack on it. So far, I like this radio the best out of the Radio Shack 
radios. It gas the advantage of not needing the relays toi turn it on 
when the box power is turned on.

&gt;  I was home at lunch time, and turned on the RS radio I&#x27;d been 
manually tuning and asked if the little black spots were 
aliens. &quot;They&quot; responded by saying &quot;they&#x27;re formo Mars&quot;, so I 
said &quot;Martians!?&quot;, and they imediately said &quot;Correct&quot;, all this while 
I was manually tuning the FM band. that&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve 
heard from, or about Martians. Some may recall that one of the first 
voices form an echo chamber was  &quot;we come from the sixth planet&quot;. 
According to some contactees, such as George Adamski, all the planets 
are populated, albieit not on this level, perhaps on the astral, or 
etheric. Adamski was the first UFO books I read as a 13 year old--
eons ago it seems.   Frank-S
