I \nrecorded it with my DVR so I could watch and review the program video \na bit better than just watching it live.\nSo... what did I think of Door to the Dead?\nLet me say this... the first episode was more entertaining than Ghost \nHunters, G.H.I., Paranormal State, and even that other one where the \nguy and his team get locked over night in places (I can&#39;t think of \nthe name right now). Note: I don&#39;t watch any of them anymore, even \nthough I did give them all a try at least once or twice.\n\nAnyway, although I had some problem with the entity &#39;orbs&#39; portion of \nthe Door to the Dead investigation, since I may have seen an &#39;orb \nsource&#39; when I put the DVR in super slow motion, the rest of the \nseries was put together nicely, with a good story line, good \ninteraction of characters, and some very entertaining and interesting \nmethods used for the variety of investigative tactics.\n\nUnlike G.H., G.H.I., Paranormal State, and that other one, I&#39;ll \nprobably watch &#39;Door to the Dead&#39; again to see how it pans out. The \nnew TruTV series caught my attention.\n\n- Mike C. (UFO Geek) http://www.ufogeek.com"}
