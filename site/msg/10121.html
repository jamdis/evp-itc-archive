---Morse Code




I'm going to have to run this one past my father, being h=
e is a Ham 
Operator (KA2RHU) in NJ for anyone who wants to know. I took 5 =
files 
and played them in a sequence and recorded it, it consists of tone 
=
frequencies ranging from 100hz, 250hz, 440hz, 1khz and 10khz. They 
were 5 =
second clips of each and than i ran it through EvpMaker and it 
sounds like=
 morse code, but i have to brush up on it to see if it makes 
any sense. Is=
 it possible for them to communicate through morse code? 
I've attached a 3=
0 second clip of the example running it through 
EvpMaker. I'll also attach=
 my original tone file i created.
