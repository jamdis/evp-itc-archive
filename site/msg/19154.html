<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>This is the time of year when my house gets overrun with boxelder bugs.
They&#x27;re harmless - they don&#x27;t bite, they only eat certain plants, but
they&#x27;re a nuisance. They are everywhere and they&#x27;re curious about
everything. If I&#x27;m sitting there with a plate of food, they have to land on
it to find out what it is.

Hopefully when the cold sets in they will go into hiding. We have several
days now when it&#x27;s supposed to be 70 here (&quot;Injun Summer&quot;).

&gt;  My work room out in the garage, and spiders come in. I told them, yeah I
&gt; talk to bugs--bite me and I gas everyone of ya! They stay outta sight. So
&gt; this was recorded in the garage last night &quot;Us, (or house) Spiders Speak&quot;
&gt; at 15 seconds. Brain is not mind, anything that lives, thinks, ghost voices
&gt; are thoughts. If man thinks he is so advanced, how many can control eight
&gt; legs and spin a web? How many eyes does a fly need if there is no intellect
&gt; to process the information? Humans vastly underestimate the rest of nature.
&gt; Human ego, unjustifiable.
&gt;
&gt;  These big radios make better boxes because the quality of the radio is
&gt; better. Better front end, not so easlily overloaded by strong nearby
&gt; signals, and better IF filter(the down conversion process), less surious
&gt; signals, clearer sound. Larger audio amplifiers, and less distortion.
