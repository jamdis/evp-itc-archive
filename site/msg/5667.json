And to help ease =\r\nthem into \n  aproaching a session eventually with confidence\n\n  and determi=\r\nnation as well as full curiousity for all types of the \n  communication we =\r\nrecieve.\n\n  My initial post of the ritual file was done with the best of \n =\r\n intentions and meant to be another tool available for those who felt \n\n  t=\r\nhey needed or wanted to employ it. it is a simple innocent prayer \n  ritual=\r\n, I don&#39;t think it is really worthy of all this debate.\n\n  Use it, don&#39;t us=\r\ne it. It&#39;s there if you want it. Also I must say \n  there are two kinds of =\r\nfear the kind that is natural and a god \n\n  given emotion for self preserva=\r\ntion, ie the fright and flight reflex \n  that is an instinctive trait in al=\r\nl of us. Then you have the \n\n  irrational dibilitating phobic fear that can=\r\n turn an individual into \n  a frozen statue. That type of fear I believe is=\r\n unhealthy\n\n  and should be addressed and dealt with and learned how to har=\r\nness. I \n  also believe that anyone that harbors that type of fear \n\n  woul=\r\nd not be drawn to the paranormal anyway and in a case of such \n  fear it wo=\r\nuld already be present and doing a small protection \n\n  ritual would not fu=\r\nel it any further. So lets take it for what it is, \n  something to utilize =\r\nin our box of tools like an emf meter.\n\n  you may have an old rusty odd siz=\r\ned wrench at the bottom of your tool \n  box at home that you inherited from=\r\n your grandfather and have never \n  used\n\n  but if you come across that odd=\r\n nut that needs tightening somedsy you \n  will be glad you have it.\n\n  Bruc=\r\ne\n\n\n\n   \r\n------=_NextPart_001_01BC_01C85959.BF1FC1B0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3Dtext/html;charset=3Diso-8859-1&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16587&quot;
