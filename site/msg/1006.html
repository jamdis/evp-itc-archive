  Subject: [EVP-ITC] Intro


  Hey all, joined a few days ago =
and just getting around to doing an intro.

  The name's Marty, I've known =
Frank (via the internet) for a year and a
  few months.

  Paranormal inves=
tigator, but not interested in promoting "negative and
  scary" as Frank ca=
lls it (or drama as I call it). Just interested in
  research, documentatio=
n, etc. 

  My main interest right now in ITC (beyond as a tool for communi=
cation)
  is in establishing guidelines/protocols/etc. for evaluation of
  =
recieved communications. I.E. you recieve a valid message (a
  confirmed IT=
C), now you have to go about validating its content. 
  Frank and I had a f=
ew discussions last year regarding context and
  meaning of some of the mat=
erial he was recieving last year around this
  time (the changes that were =
to occur around May through July in 2006)
  for example.

  I'm very intere=
sted in hearing other list member's experience in this
  area and look forw=
ard to contributing to this discussion list.

  Marty
