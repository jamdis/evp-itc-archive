You are once again expanding the circle.  Funny, \nI too was playing around with LEDs this morning, using them to vary \nthe voltages.  I put a couple of photoresistors in the circuit to \nenjoy the changes in voltage with shadows and light.\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  I have 49, and 31 meter shortwave bands, plus AM. The shortwave \ntuning might be tricky cuz the band width is less than half the size \nof the AM band, about 500 khz, so instead of tuning over a megahertz \nwith 8 volts, you&#39;re tuning about half that with the same tuning \nvoltage. So far I only have the local oscillators working, still need \nthe input RF amp for each band. The two cans close to the chip are IF \ntransformers, the three on the bottom edge o fthe board is the local \noscillator tank circuits.  On the highest band I&#39;m using a red LED \nfor a varactor, it has almost the perfect capacitance value. 31m on \nmy Sony is 9400 khz to 9800 khz, and 49m is 5900 to 6200khz.  Still, \nhow well it works, if at all, is yet to be seen.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  I really-really need a life!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Frank-S  http://www.hamuniverse.com/shortwavebandfreqs.html 31 \nmeters  92509995 kHz  Good year-round night band; seasonal during \nthe day, with best reception in winter.
