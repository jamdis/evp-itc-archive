But nevertheless\nI think it&#39;s worth to experiment with it.\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Hi Steve,\n\n&gt; the CW decoder gets mainly the letters E, I and T.\n&gt; I also noticed that the beeps are all the same length in your file.\n\n&gt; So I made a raw audio file for EVPmaker that contains three cues: The\n&gt; &quot;dit&quot; and &quot;dah&quot; beeps, and an &quot;intra-character gap&quot;:\n\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Stefan/Morse%20code/morse.wav\n\n&gt; The &quot;Use Cue List&quot; option must be checked in EVPmaker to use this file.\n\n&gt; Now it sounds a bit more like actual morse code, and CwGet is able to\n&gt; decode more letters. Perhaps some former ham operators &quot;over there&quot; are\n&gt; able to use it... :)\n\n&gt; Stefan"}
