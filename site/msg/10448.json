I know that this \ntype\n&gt; of communication and use of radios has been going on since 1988 and\n&gt; you stepped up to the plate and improved on the original process. \n&gt; But, balanced people are strongly encouraged to always be aware of \nthe\n&gt; emotional and mental issues that can possibly happen. Now for the UN\n&gt; BALANCED? Well, you have all experienced the results. So, lets drop\n&gt; the issue and get on with our spirituality and growth and learn \nmore,\n&gt; and have fun doing it at the same dern time.\n&gt; \n&gt; LK\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Hi All; We have been warned by others from time to time about\n&gt; unbridled box use, as it supposedly brings in negativity. I don&#39;t \nwant\n&gt; to believe that, but there are a few cases of people using boxes \nmade\n&gt; by me, as well as the hack radios, and going whacko big time. Its&#39;\n&gt; either all ego--I&#39;m the onlyest one that can use this, or like the\n&gt; more recent example. I don&#39;t know if these people were like this to\n&gt; start, or if it&#39;s an external influance, but it&#39;s discouraging. \nThere\n&gt; seems to be a similar reaction with systems not made by me--so I&#39;ve\n&gt; been told.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  Soooo, maybe burn some white candles, and maybe get a Rosary. My\n&gt; guys talk about the Catholics, and the Purple Princess has a \nCatholic\n&gt; connection on the etheric levels, although the church imposes too \nmany\n&gt; limits on her. I wouldn&#39;t want to go into a state of fear, but a\n&gt; little protection stuff couldn&#39;t hurt. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  Not only do I not have the time to mass produce boxes, I&#39;m\n&gt; beginning to think it&#39;s not a good idea anyway. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Express yourself wherever you are.
