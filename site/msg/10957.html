Hello! My name is Sandie. I live in Renton, WA.

I've been fascinated  with the paranormal since I was young. My
mother's side of the family is  sensitive to the paranormal and I have
one aunt that is a medium, albeit a  very reluctant one. I should also
mention that my mother's side of the  family is from Taiwan and it the
culture can be very superstitious, hence  my aunt's reluctance.

I think I've always had some experience with the  paranormal, from
places I lived to places I've visited, but it's very rare  that I see
them. Unfortunately, I didn't inherit that ability. I've only  had
one experience with seeing a spirit/ghost when I was awake.

I've  recently started to record EVPs, and it's been trying to say the
least. If  I'm getting anything, I don't hear it on playback. 
HOWEVER, recently I  visited a cemetery to show my daughter our
relatives' headstones and we  wandered the place with a recorder, as
well as took pictures.

Upon  playback, I notated 23 instances of possible EVPs, 5 or 6 were
clear enough  to actually hear specific words. Whether or not they're
what I think they  are is another question. The others I pulled from
the master are unknowns  and questionables, but suspected EVPs. I just
can't make it out.

I  use Audacity, which I really do not like. I had Audition, a full
version,  but lost it when my computer crashed, and I loved that one. 

Anyway,  I'll upload the EVPs. If anyone can help in verifying what I
think is being  said, I'd appreciate it.

I will note that these are direct copies from  the master, so there's
been no cleanup done to them. Mostly because I need  to learn to use
Audacity's filtering and noise reduction without removing  the voices.

I have them in .wav files, so I'll convert them to .mp3 and  upload
them, to save on space.

=)

Sandie
