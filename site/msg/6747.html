Hi Deb,
 
Let's just say, when any researcher tries to do a public box ses=
sion for people that 
have not only never heard a box but did not even know=
 what one is until the actual demonstration.
 
Let's just say you will have=
 99.9% of the people walking away going "what was that, the guy was listeni=
ng to a scrambled radio
and asking it questions"
 
The chances are, even if=
 the audience where familiar with the box and the theory and technical func=
tioning that allows for real time communication
with spirits. they would no=
t on their first or maybe even their tenth attempt hear any words or respon=
ses to questions.
 
Not to mention, the demonstrator better hope that he or=
 she has somewhat favorable conditions for a successful session.
It is just=
 not a good practice unless your audience has some knowledge and experience=
 with a box of some type.
 
Any public session I have heard of left the maj=
ority of individuals involved with a sour taste for box research.
And that =
includes Staten Island ,Halloween night or so I've been told. by the presen=
ter himself.
 
That's why if you ask the original box inventor he will tell=
 you that his intention was for the box to be a stationary research tool.
n=
ot a location device.
