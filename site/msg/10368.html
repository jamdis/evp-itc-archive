Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: FILE SIZE. MISTY

                Hi, Misty.

Thanks for considering the ideas.  I try not to upload a whole lot, 
unless it is interesting.  It's not that I do not have recordings, 
it's just how many of these can a person store here, etc.  I would 
prefer just to maintain a small amount of them that are small file 
size as examples of what I am doing. Just let me know of any changes 
I should make...glad to do it.  

I understand moderating is a thankless job. So, thank you for doing 
it.  Not sure how anyone does it, to be honest.  It probably feels 
like being Barney Fife in a Mike Tyson-Evander Holyfield brawl on 
some of these message boards.  LOL ;)
