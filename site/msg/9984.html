  It is about 13 years old, but was build on property that was owned by the Stone sisters of Cary, NC. The home they owned which is down the street is a plantation home, massive, and has slave quarters under it. That home was built in the 1800's.  I get voices every time I turn that radio on, but I only mp3 those that are clear enough that most people can hear them.
   
  Id love to take the radio into that house. I know the guy that owns it, and he tells me they have ghosts in that house, but they are Baptist, and not sure if they might be offended if I were to ask. I know some devout Baptist that are totally against what we are doing. Know what I mean.....

  Was it you that said your house was built sometime in the mid 1800's. You seem to have some strong spirits at your house.
