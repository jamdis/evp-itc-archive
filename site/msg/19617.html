<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I saw a couple which could be construed as images in the one series you had
from SEA, but nothing that knocked me over the head yet.  I am going to have
to see a larger sample size before I determine if what you have witnessed is
in fact a form or not.  I cannot accept an image as paranormal without
knowing where it sits among the bulk of audio files.  If every file has
multiple faces, the I would have  to say that there is nothing there.

So, I will certainly keep testing with my copy and hopefully something will
really pop for me.  I have run through about ten files (EVP and GBC) so far
for intensive study and I still haven&#x27;t got anything that I would consider a
positive hit.  I need an actual formed face, not portions thereof, to
consider an image real.  This is the only way to discount visual matrixing.

I have high hopes for this though!

&gt;  I&#x27;ve seen live webcast of ITC sessions where GB output is fed directly
&gt; into the mic line in on a computer running Adobe Audition with the
&gt; spectragraph running. It was really compelling to see letters and numbers,
&gt; not images or pictures, but partial words appear in the graph. At first it
&gt; was I thought it was a software glitch but it is a repeatable event. It was
&gt; on LiveSciFi which is run by Tim Wood, he also thought there was some kind
&gt; of code error but it happened on more than one webcast.
&gt;
&gt; So if anyone has Audition, just feed Box output right in your computer and
&gt; see what happens. I wanted to try it tonight but I have Audacity and the
&gt; spectragraph feature doesn&#x27;t have that shaded appearance that Audition does
&gt; so it&#x27;s not able to render images or characters, at least as far as I see
&gt; using the various settings.

&gt; &gt; I have tried numerous EVP files and short box clips and so far
&gt; &gt; nothing discernible has appeared on either program. I still have a lot of
&gt; &gt; hope though.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but I am going to try to work this in to a
&gt; &gt; session tonight!
