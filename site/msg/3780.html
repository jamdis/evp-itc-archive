<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Chris&#x27;s statements are conflicting and appear defensive. 

It&#x27;s as plain as the nose on my face that money is at stake.

constructive discussion.Guess that&#x27;s more of the wishy-washy&gt; depends 
on what my hair feelslike doing ways here. from his own blog 
(clipped, but not otherwisealtered):&quot;Wednesday, November 28, 2007The 
Box has hit the fan!Currentmood: distressed&quot;I have recentlybeen made 
aware that there are severalreplica versions of thisdevice being 
sold. I have also been told ofanother device that canbe purchased for 
very little from anyelectronics merchant andaltered by hand, 
producing what some considerto be results. As Iexpected, the samples 
that people have sent me are*nothing morethan timed radio scans that 
have no validity.* [emphasismine]&quot;These new &quot;radio scanners&quot; are not 
only *a waste of money*forpeople looking to do research with them in 
hopes of havingeffectivecommunication with the other side, but may in 
fact be *verydangerous*.Should demonic and other negative entities 
learn to usethesefalsedevices, *the results could be 
devastating.*&quot;...The CatholicChurch ... predicted the widespread sale 
of*false communicationdevices* as far back as last year. *I have 
recentlybegun to receiverequests from individuals asking for help to 
closenegative doorwaysand portals that they believe they opened 
usingtheir purchasedTelephone to the Dead replica*. Others are 
claiming&gt; that I am a fraudbecause their purchased device doesn&#x27;t 
producethe positive results Ihave been fortunate enough to have.&quot;So 
let&#x27;s go throug thisagain:*nothing more than timed radio scans that 
have no validity.**awaste of money**very dangerous**the results could 
bedevastating.**false communication devices**I have recently begun 
toreceive requests from individuals asking forhelp to close 
negativedoorways and portals that they believe theyopened using 
theirpurchased Telephone to the Dead replica.*As you see, there are 
twostatements that Chris is making--so much forhe&#x27;s always 
consistant,which I believe was an earlier statement thatyou made.1. 
The new boxescreate accidental timed radio scans only.2. The new 
boxes are verydangerous because they draw negative results.I&#x27;m not 
sure how the twostatements can stand together, but in eithercase, his 
opinion isclearly not complimentary toward the rest of thebox users 
besides thefour of the 30 he says, in the same post, &quot;havebeen 
identified.&quot;Rathercheeky and insulting and wrong, HMO. But if he just 
goes ondoingsessions like the one APSR recorded, I will continue to 
laud them.Ann &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
