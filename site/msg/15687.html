Hey All

Apparently in astrological terms there is some kind of new turn, i=
.e. movement of planets atmoshperic change or something that is happening w=
hich start during the month of August...gets intense from the 15th onwards =
till the 9th of September.

I may be way off the point...and I think I am, =
but im sure atmospheric conditions effect the quality of communications wit=
h these guys. maybe they are preparing us all that a bridge will be easier =
to build on these dates..again dont shoot me on this because I could be so =
damn wrong.

just a thought

E

by this, do you mean it's possible it takes a couple of sessions for the en=

 and was the primary person we communicated with, even correctly answered m=
