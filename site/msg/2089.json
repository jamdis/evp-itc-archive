They never identified themselves as those people,  \nbut the voices were dead ringers (ar ar ar).  I am also, apparently,  \nable to randomly project my voice into the minds of people I know. It  \nbegins to happen to almost everyone that I bond strongly with. I  \ncan&#39;t tell you how many times I have heard someone I know spin around  \nand say, &quot;What?&quot; They always say they hear my voice, but don&#39;t  \nunderstand what I am saying. This is always accompanied, on my end,  \nby a sort of ringing sound in my head. I cannot control it at all.  \nI&#39;m just throwing this out there as food for thought that may pertain  \nto your discussion.....\n\nAnn\n\nOn Sep 18, 2007, at 8:13 AM, Zack Widup wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Very true, Frank!

I think most of the EVP we get are from disembodied beings who\n&gt; have figured out how to do it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Zack\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, 17 Sep 2007, Frank Sumption wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s not brain! We are all spirit, of course we can create our  \n&gt; own EVPs. You don&#39;t suddenly become spirit when you die, you just  \n&gt; wake up. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t ask questions, I don&#39;t want to create  \n&gt; the answers I&#39;m looking for.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank-S\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;"}
