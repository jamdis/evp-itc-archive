<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>HI Everyone,
I posted some of the EVPs in the files section.
maybe ya&#x27;ll can have a listen and tell me what you think?
on each file, in description I put the counter numbers to listen for.
I have a small RCA digital recorder and these were what we got the first 
week,.
just an experiment really.
we have a lot of activity in the house (for 11 yrs), and we wanted to find 
out what or who it was.
so far we&#x27;ve gotten 2 names, william, and philip . and a spanish lady with 
an accent , and what sounds like a young child.  at least to me this is what 
it sounds like.
but we&#x27;re new to this, so maybe others here will know more of whats being 
said.. etc.

a question tho.. do these spirits get upset by asking them questions ?
a friend told me to stop doing the evps as its upsetting the spirits. so am 
wondering can this happen ?  do my recordings sound as tho they are upset ?
we need to know, as the last thing I want in this house is an upset spirit. 
!!!
on one of the recordings towards the end (Lian3 )I think it was, my daughter 
asked how many were here and the spanish lady says &#x27;three&#x27;.
she sounds the clearest of them all.  the male voice that says &#x27;william&#x27; is 
fast we had to slow it down.  but the last one we did was the one that says 
growl.
that one scared me. so we&#x27;ve done no more ... and this is why I am asking 
questions..
I invested in this recorder with plans to be using it.. and now..am not sure 
if I should.
but I felt like we got great results for our very first try.
so wanting to hear from others with experience...I need to know more about 
evps.
thanks
