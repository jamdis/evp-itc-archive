<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s me, SPIRIT_RADIO/Mark. My SPIRIT_RADIO account is fubar right now so I logged in with this alias. Any investigations coming up? Halloweens right around the corner. 

Not much investigating going on, work and school keeping me extremely busy. Due to this fact, I put some of my equipment on ebay. Sold the EM Pump already. The PX is up on the auction block right now. Can&#x27;t say it priced at a bargain though. The last one posted sold for over $400.00 so I feel mine is priced at what the market will bear.

Phone apps are what I use when I&#x27;m in an appropriate location. Wish Bill Chappell would write some for the Android market. I do have his stuff on my Itouch though. 

Thought I would stop by. Going to play with the Ouji board now (JK!). I&#x27;ll check back in a bit.

Take Care,

Mark</pre>
