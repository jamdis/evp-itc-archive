My wife Patt witnessed it, so it&#39;s n=\r\not my\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; imagination that it did turn on. As I stepped into the room, th=\r\ne\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;morning show&quot; cut to a voice saying &quot;MMM! Cinnamon rolls and coffe=\r\ne!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Bring enough for us?&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I happened to be holding a mug o=\r\nf hot coffee and a plate of cinnamon\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rolls that Patt had baked for br=\r\neakfast. I scalded myself as I sloshed\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; coffee around after hearing th=\r\ne voice!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I am not the type who tells stories or seeks attention=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I thought for a few moments that I was listening to a radio t=\r\nalk show\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and that it was a coincidence that the mention of cinnamon r=\r\nolls\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; happened as I stepped into the room. But I eventually blurted ou=\r\nt a\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;hello,&quot; and was answered. After a few moments and to my question=\r\ns,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the voice said his name was Steve Tate -- and following a\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ba=\r\nck-and-forth conversation that I recorded he said he was a Virginia\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; s=\r\ntate trooper who died in 1989 in a car crash a mile from his home.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ov=\r\ner the next day or two, he said his body was buried in Redmond, Va.,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nand we spoke for several days in little snatches of conversation.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Alo=\r\nng the way, a fellow named &quot;Luke&quot; entered the conversation. Other\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; unn=\r\named voices began to say &quot;Hi Al!&quot; It was a bit too much.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I was =\r\nbrought up in a very strict Protestant family. I became leery of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; what=\r\n was unfolding. I bashed the radio and threw it in the trash. Then\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I =\r\nbegan hearing the voices mixed in with my CPAP machine (I have sleep\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\napnea) at night, which makes a high-pitched whooshing noise.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ne=\r\nxt, I began hearing the &quot;Hi Al!&quot; voice as a faint whisper now and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the=\r\nn as I&#39;d walk through the house.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I got scared. I had gotten rid=\r\n of the radio(s) but was still hearing\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the voices. I felt I was going=\r\n crazy. I told my pastor about it and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; asked for help. He refused -- s=\r\naid he was afraid he might get an\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;attachment&quot; and bring it home to h=\r\nis family. I contacted something\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; like 20 protestant pastors by phone =\r\nand not a single one of them would\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; come to my home to help.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; Eventually a Catholic priest agreed to help on the condition that I\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; supply a recording of the voices as &quot;proof&quot; of the problem. Using my\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; digital recorder, I recorded so many &quot;conversations&quot; that I filled up\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; a CD. Awhile later, after turning it over to the priest, the Catholic\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; bishop granted the priest permission to come to our home to conduct a\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mass and an &quot;exorcism of place.&quot; The priest explained that old homes\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and other places could become &quot;infested&quot; with evil spirits. After he\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; performed the ceremony, the voices seemed to quit for awhile but\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n returned after a few days.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, I was not sure whether the voi=\r\nces were &quot;evil&quot; or just\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;conversational.&quot; My brother died of kidney f=\r\nailure during this time\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and I later heard his voice calling my name. =\r\nIt ~was~ his voice.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; A lot more has happened.... At this point, =\r\nI am no longer &quot;surprised&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; by hearing the voices electronically or ot=\r\nherwise. I just want to know\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; more about what&#39;s happening -- how it ca=\r\nn possibly be &quot;real&quot; and what\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I should understand in terms of the big=\r\n picture....\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Al\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; -- \n&gt;&gt; Al\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;Try=\r\n again, fail again.

I r=\r\neally takes personal experience to believe this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; stuff exists.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Jill&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- I=\r\nn &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofoll=\r\now ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com&lt;/A=\r\n&gt;,\n Al Harris &lt;algerharris@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n Hi Dave,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, for example, I walked int=\r\no our &quot;computer room&quot; (spare&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bedroom/office/ library) not =\r\nlong after the evps were recorded and my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; radio turned itse=\r\nlf on. My wife Patt witnessed it, so it&#39;s not my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; imaginati=\r\non that it did turn on. As I stepped into the room, the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;m=\r\norning show&quot; cut to a voice saying &quot;MMM! Cinnamon rolls and coffee!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; Bring enough for us?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I happene=\r\nd to be holding a mug of hot coffee and a plate of cinnamon&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; rolls that Patt had baked for breakfast. I scalded myself as I sloshed&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; coffee around after hearing the voice!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; I am not the type who tells stories or seeks attention.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I thought for a few moments that I was\n listeni=\r\nng to a radio talk show&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and that it was a coincidence that=\r\n the mention of cinnamon rolls&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; happened as I stepped into =\r\nthe room. But I eventually blurted out a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;hello,&quot; and was =\r\nanswered. After a few moments and to my questions,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the voi=\r\nce said his name was Steve Tate -- and following a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; back-an=\r\nd-forth conversation that I recorded he said he was a Virginia&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; state trooper who died in 1989 in a car crash a mile from his home.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Over the next day or two, he said his body was buried in Red=\r\nmond, Va.,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and we spoke for several days in little snatche=\r\ns of conversation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Along the way, a fellow named &quot;Luke&quot; en=\r\ntered the conversation. Other&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; unnamed voices began to say =\r\n&quot;Hi Al!&quot; It was a bit too much.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I was bro=\r\nught up in a very strict Protestant family. I became leery\n of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; what was unfolding. I bashed the radio and threw it in the trash. Then=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I began hearing the voices mixed in with my CPAP machine =\r\n(I have sleep&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; apnea) at night, which makes a high-pitched =\r\nwhooshing noise.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Next, I began hearing th=\r\ne &quot;Hi Al!&quot; voice as a faint whisper now and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; then as I&#39;d wa=\r\nlk through the house.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I got scared. I had=\r\n gotten rid of the radio(s) but was still hearing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the voic=\r\nes. I felt I was going crazy. I told my pastor about it and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; asked for help. He refused -- said he was afraid he might get an&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &quot;attachment&quot; and bring it home to his family. I contacted somethin=\r\ng&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; like 20 protestant pastors by phone and not a single one=\r\n of them would&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; come to my home to help.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Eventually a Catholic priest agreed\n to help on the conditi=\r\non that I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; supply a recording of the voices as &quot;proof&quot; of t=\r\nhe problem. Using my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; digital recorder, I recorded so many =\r\n&quot;conversations&quot; that I filled up&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a CD. Awhile later, after=\r\n turning it over to the priest, the Catholic&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bishop grante=\r\nd the priest permission to come to our home to conduct a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; m=\r\nass and an &quot;exorcism of place.&quot; The priest explained that old homes&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; and other places could become &quot;infested&quot; with evil spirits. After=\r\n he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; performed the ceremony, the voices seemed to quit for =\r\nawhile but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; returned after a few days.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, I was not sure whether the voices were &quot;evil&quot; or just&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;conversational.&quot; My brother died of kidney failure during t=\r\nhis time&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and I later heard his voice calling my name. It ~=\r\nwas~ his voice.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt; A lot more has happened.=\r\n... At this point, I am no longer &quot;surprised&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; by hearing t=\r\nhe voices electronically or otherwise. I just want to know&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n more about what&#39;s happening -- how it can possibly be &quot;real&quot; and what&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; I should understand in terms of the big picture....&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Al&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; -- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Al&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Try again, fail again.
