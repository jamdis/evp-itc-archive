OK...I did my test with a 4.43 MB wav file.

I experienced no noticeable lo=
ss, and the file was the same size before and after being emailed.

That st=
ill doesn't prove that maybe in some situations loss is possible.

But agai=
n, like RJ, I have never experienced it myself.

        A file's content, it's integrity, is simply the bytes (and their b=

definition, changing the bytes.  If the bytes in there are not changed, the=

        It is possible to mess with othe=

s does not effect the contents, and so would not affect that integrity, or =
the sound of the file (assuming you could read it at all after changing the=
 ownership, or the suffix, etc).

        When you do your tests, if you ca=

e sizes.  If they are identical, there is a very high probability that the =
content has not changed.

                  Yes you ca=

and asked you which file each came from, there would be no way to tell.  Ev=
en the audio player could not tell.  The data is identical, and so the soun=

                  Yes I did li=

                              For executables, you may be right.=
 However, for wav files, the compression during email is not loss less. 

 =
                             I used to think as you do, in that the emailed=
 attachment of a wav file would not loose anything. After a lengthy discour=
se with another member here, I learned that I was wrong. The reason why I d=
id not realize it in the first place is that when I would email a wav file,=
 I would intentionally keep it in very small segments, to keep file size do=
wn. This was just for ease of transfer. But because of this, I had not expe=
rienced any noticeable loss.

                              Now it may be i=
n some cases, depending on the servers or what have you that the file goes =
through, that the loss may be less or more. But once the attachment is down=
loaded, the quality has been found to be less then the original wav.

     =
                         Again though you can only really tell when the wav=

                                The kind of compr=
ession that occurs during an email attachment is "lossless": it compress th=
e file cleverly without losing information.  For example, if I had a progra=
m in some .exe files, and I sent it over email, it could compress it.  But =
if it lost even one bit, the resulting exe file would not execute again aft=
er it was uncompressed on the other side.

                                =
This kind of compression does things like looking for common patterns in th=
e file, and replacing them with a token.  A rough example would be if it fo=
und "Howdy Neighbor" in a file 20 times, it could replace all the occurance=
s with say $HN1.  And also write a little dictionary in there someplace tha=
t says "$HN1=3DHowdy Neighbor".

                                When the f=
ile gets to its destination it can be uncompressed, and all occurences of $=
HN1 are replaced with "Howdy Neighbor".  So it was compressed (instead of 1=
4 characters each, it only needed 4, plus the dictionary), but lost no data=
.

                                Some formats, like jpeg and mp3. are not=
 lossless.  Depending on the level of compression, some level of data is lo=
st, and so cannot be recovered or reconstructed later.

                                I=
 recently found this out. When you email a file, if it is not saved as a co=
mpressed format, the email filtering process will actually compress the fil=
e automatically.

                                So even if you have attac=
hed a wav. file, it will loose resolution over the email process. It will n=
ot sound exactly the same as the original wav. file. How much it differs de=
pends on the size of the file you are attaching. If it is a very large file=
, it will sound much different.

                                The only e=
xception to this is if the wav. file is small enough that the filtering pro=
cess will ignore it. It has to be pretty small though, like under 1 MB (I a=
m not exactly sure of the threshold).

                                The =
best way to share files over the internet if you want them as close to the =
original as possible is to upload them directly to a website.

                                Pixelization doesn't clean-up the data: it=
