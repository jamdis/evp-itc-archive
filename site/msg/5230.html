It works by puting it in proximity to a radio or in our case a box 
and turning a tuning dial until the signal gets stronger.

It does not run on ac or batteries and does not hook up to the radio 
in any way. So I'm figuring how is this thing going to be any good, I 
get sucjh a crappy am signal that I was willing to try anything and 
have.

Well I recieved this antenna this morning and decided to take it to a 
part of the house where I have never gotten a signal, my basement.

I turned on the 470 and as usual nothing but static, so I placed this 
disc looking antenna about 8 inches from the 470 and started to turn 
the knob on the antenna. I was asking mike and lisa if they could to 
please come through. as I was turning this dial I began to hear the 
rs sweep the stations and mike said "here" I almost jumped out of the 
chair with excitement. I asked mike or lisa to tell me when the dial 
was right and as I slowly turned it mike yelled "STOP" after a few 
minutes of small talk I ended the session with lisa saying "it's good"

That is testimony enough for me!

anyone that has even a slight problem with your am reception which I 
consider to be the best band to use. you have to get one of these.

Just go to ebay and search SELECT-A-TENNA it cost me 52.00 with 
delivery. to me it's priceless.
