The experiment was for \n               =\r\n       participants to determine what it was. Vague or partial \n           =\r\n           answers wouldn&#39;t be counted (for example, just colors, \n        =\r\n              shapes, sizes, what it&#39;s made of, etc): we&#39;re looking for \n  =\r\n                    what it is. Participants could use their ghost boxes, E=\r\nVP \n                      recorders, or I suppose any other means they \n   =\r\n                   chose.\n\nIn order to keep me honest, I took a picture \n  =\r\n                    of the object at the start of the experiment and loaded=\r\n it \n                      to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group. =\r\nIf you can \n                      follow the link, it is here:\n\nhttp://tech=\r\n. groups.yahoo. \n                      com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.2010=\r\n0710. \n                      1.zip\n\nThe idea was that you could download th=\r\ne \n                      file at the beginning of the test, and &#39;keep it sa=\r\nfe&#39; on \n                      your computer. Then at the end of the test, I=\r\n would \n                      release the password so you could reveal the =\r\ncontents of \n                      the file. That way, you were in control =\r\nof the original \n                      image during the entire test, not me=\r\n. \n\nThe password \n                      for that file is: 123BlastOff\nInstr=\r\nuctions, if you need \n                      them, are also in that RJ folde=\r\nr.\n\nAnd if you did \n                      not care to download the zip file=\r\n before the test, I will \n                      post the final image there =\r\ntoo.\n\nSo to the \n                      results:\n\nNumber of participants: 5\n=\r\nTotal tries: \n                      8\nAmbiguous answers: 0\nCorrect answers:=\r\n \n                      0\n\nObject: A radio\nUzipped picture:\nhttp://tech. gr=\r\noups.yahoo. \n                      com/group/ EVP-ITC/files/ RJ/RJ.20100710=\r\n. \n                      1.JPG\n\nSo what do the results mean? All that we \n =\r\n                     can really agree on from this experiment is that no \n =\r\n                     participant, with whatever theories or methods or \n   =\r\n                   technology they used, was able to correctly determine th=\r\ne \n                      object.

We c=\r\nan&#39;t say those theories or methods or \n                      technologies n=\r\never work. Just as we can&#39;t say they do. \n                      Just that, =\r\nfor whatever reason, they did not work this \n                      time. Re=\r\naders can take the results, use them to improve or \n                      c=\r\nhange their methods, or keep doing what they&#39;re \n                      doin=\r\ng.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If anyone has any observations, comments, or \n                   =\r\n   ideas for improvement, let me know.
