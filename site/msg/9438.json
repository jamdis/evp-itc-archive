Do you have a photo of \nthe citrine crystal&#39;s cut? \n \nI would like to experiment with the crystal imaging in the future.  \nI&#39;ll check out your website further, too.  ;)\n\nLC\nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi LC.  Thanks so much.  All (well, most) of the images on my site \nwere done using my \n&gt; water technique (link to instructions on lower left of page 2 of \nthe site).  I do have a couple \n&gt; of crystal collages (also page 2, lower right - if you click on \neither image, a collage will \n&gt; pop up).  I have gotten, as I recall, a dog in one of the crystal \nshots.\n&gt; \n&gt; So far, I&#39;ve found that the citrine quartz works well if it has \nlots of lines in it (I don&#39;t know \n&gt; what the technical term is, occlusions?  Inclusions??) rather than \nbeing clear.  These seems \n&gt; to give them something to use to show themselves, if that makes \nsense.  I can actually \n&gt; watch them appearing my view finder, but usually can&#39;t photograph \nwhat I&#39;m seeing.  \n&gt; Might try videoing the crystal like I do with my water technique to \nsee if that helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; With the water, I never see what is coming through until I go back \nand review the session, \n&gt; one frame at a time.  Sometimes I get a whole lotta nothing, and \nother times I&#39;m totally \n&gt; blown away by the clarity of an image.  I hope some member here \nwill try it.  :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Margaret, were the animal captures photographs of a crystal?  \n&gt; &gt; Phenomenal images!

She loved animals like I do. She owned a Bakery \nand \n&gt; &gt; lived\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; across the street from me for years. The dog that my \nfirst \n&gt; &gt; wife and I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had at that time was a Scottish Terrier named Abbra (Her \n&gt; &gt; official name\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was Aberdeen, as in the Scottish town) anyway, I used to \nhear \n&gt; &gt; Jean\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking and I would look out the window and there she \nwould \n&gt; &gt; be,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sneaking snacks to Miss Abbra who needed bakery snacks \nabout \n&gt; &gt; like I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. LOL. Thats when we figured out why Miss Abbra wasn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; losing weight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on her new diet.

I have some EVP of a woman \ntalking \n&gt; &gt; to my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dog.  One time when I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was recording, my dog (Kindred) started barking.  When \nI \n&gt; &gt; listened\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back to the session (this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was tradition EVP done in silence with a digital \nrecorder) \n&gt; &gt; she had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said, &quot;Kindred.

I \n&gt; &gt; think it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great that sometimes they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are talking directly to the dog.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I only have one involving my cat, Kizmyt, where someone \n&gt; &gt; says, &quot;Stay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back&quot; (the cat had \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come into the room as I was recording).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have gotten many ITC images of animals, so clearly \nthey \n&gt; &gt; are an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important part of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirit realm.  :-)  As well, I had animals come through \n&gt; &gt; during\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting with a medium.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for sharing about your Molly EVP!
