<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I notice it says video players I was curious if that plays Sumptions
3g2 files too? I usually have to convert those to watch them. The
sound files audacity opens no problem.

&gt; &gt; Hmmm...some of the same files from other list members work but not 
&gt; those. 
&gt; &gt; We even sorted out our cookies...and checked and eliminated a lot 
&gt; of other crap in the Internet Options section of the Settings and 
&gt; they still won&#x27;t work. Has me quite puzzled...

&gt; &gt; Occasionally that happens. Dont know why.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Usually just saving the file and opening it with audacity does the 
&gt; &gt; trick for me, or other file player besides win media player. I do 
&gt; not 
&gt; &gt; know why it has a conflict with some files I have seen different 
&gt; &gt; modes, stereo mono, and diff hz files that do not want to open in 
&gt; &gt; windows media player. Often a file you clipped beside it using same 
&gt; &gt; settings will open fine while the other dont.

&gt; &gt; &gt; thats weird, i know its a pain but did you trying saving and then 
&gt; &gt; opening?  Think someone said that worked for them....I have no idea 
&gt; &gt; why mine do that.  Anyone have any thoughts?
