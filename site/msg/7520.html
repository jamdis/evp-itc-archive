Hi Lisa   Welcome.  It seems it is not where you buy a radio or what you buy....the issue is how do you hack it.  If you can hack a box so that the scan does not stop...why not try it.  Otherwise the RS hacks discussed and shown here give you the advantage of not throwing money away.  Ron L

I am new to the group and wanted to say hello. My name is Lisa and I
am the Founder & Director of PRISM, Paranormal Researchers in
Southeastern Michigan. My fascination with evps and all of the 'buzz'
about these boxes lately have me more curious than a cat lol So, here
I am!

I am wondering if you can purchase a radio anywhere to hack it, or if
it has to be a radio from Radio Shack? Sorry if my question seems
stupid..I am NOT a technical person at all, so this will be
interesting, to say the least. I have been browsing through the
messages and some are like Chinese to me right now, but none the less
I am enjoying them :-)

Best of luck to all with their ongoing research!

Lisa
