In recent boxes the echo box was 2 X 6 X 8 \ninches, I need to to get that size down, this one is 3 1/2 X 4-1/4 X 3/4 \ninches. The size choice was arbitrary, and the metal was scrap stuff at \nwork, the top & bottom are aluminum, and the side and channel seperators are \ngalvanized &quot;tin&quot; also scarp from work.  I have used boxes as large as 4 feet \nlong, and a foot square, but some of the voices were so negative it was \nfrightening, but that may have because it worked so well the darkheads \nwanted to scare me off of that approach. It looks like the camera lens was \nnot pointed all the way straight(it pivots).\n\nFrank-S\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nhttp://newlivehotmail.com\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_2c55_3398_63f4\r\nContent-Type: image/pjpeg; name=&quot;TinyEchoBox.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;TinyEchoBox.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_2c55_3398_63f4--"}
