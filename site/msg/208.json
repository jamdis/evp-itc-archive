I am using a pc tv/fm card without the fm antenna hooked up. I watch tv on my pc sometimes and it has radio. There are friends there who loved using the computer so they are always talking about it and what I need to do with it. Some of the things I have tried and it worked, some I havent gotten around to yet. This was one they mentioned and I tried but the results werent astounding me until recently.\n   \n  I still bounce back to the old &quot;water&quot; method and use it along with the radio. I asked them if anyone could use this method and the results were varied. I guess it depends on who the person is. For instance I had one voice say clearly &quot;it really works&quot;, then once I saved it and played it back it had changed to &quot;it didnt work&quot;. But heres one answer that didnt change so perhaps you can hear this one. I&#39;ll also add the it really works one for you to see what you hear on your end. If you hear it really works maybe you can use this method easily.\n   \n  Misty\n\nJody Cupp &lt;bigrig309@...&gt; wrote:\n            Wow very cool, I can hear them but a bit different then you.
