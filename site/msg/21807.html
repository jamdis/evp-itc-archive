    Publius  Lentulus
 
According to the The Catholic Encyclopedi,  Publius Lentulus is a 
fictitious person, said to have been Governor of  Judea before Pontius, and to have 
written the following letter to the  Roman Senate:  
"Lentulus, the Governor of the Jerusalemites  to the Roman Senate and 
People, greetings.  
There has appeared in our times, and there  still lives, a man of great 
power (virtue), called Jesus Christ. The  people call him prophet of truth; his 
disciples, son of God. He raises the  dead, and heals infirmities. He is a 
man of medium size (statura  procerus, mediocris et spectabilis); tall in 
stature.  He has a  venerable aspect, and his beholders can both fear and love 
him. His hair  is of the colour of the ripe hazel-nut, straight down to the 
ears, but  below the ears wavy and curled, with a bluish and bright 
reflection,  flowing over his shoulders. It is parted in two on the top of the 
head,  after the pattern of the Nazarenes. His brow is smooth and vary cheerful  
with a face without wrinkle or spot, embellished by a slightly reddish  
complexion. His nose and mouth are faultless. His beard is abundant, of  the 
colour of his hair, not long, but divided at the chin. His aspect is  simple 
and mature, his eyes are changeable and bright. He is terrible in  his 
reprimands, sweet and amiable in his admonitions, cheerful without  loss of 
gravity. He was never known to laugh, but often to weep. His  stature is straight, 
his hands and arms beautiful to behold. His  conversation is grave, 
infrequent, and modest. He is the most beautiful  among the children of men." 
Different manuscripts vary from the foregoing  text in several details: 
Dobschutz ("Christusbilder", Leipzig, 1899)  enumerates the manuscripts and 
gives an "apparatus criticus" . The letter  was first printed in the "Life of 
Christ" by Ludolph the Carthusian  (Cologne, 1474), and in the "Introduction 
to the works of St. Anselm"  (Nuremberg, 1491). But it is neither the work 
of St. Anselm nor of  Ludolph. According to the manuscript of Jena, a certain 
Giacomo Colonna  found the letter in 1421 in an ancient Roman document sent 
to Rome from  Constantinople. It must be of Greek origin, and translated 
into Latin  during the thirteenth or fourteenth century, though it received 
its  present form at the hands of humanist of the fifteenth or sixteenth  
century. The description agrees with the so-called Abgar picture of our  Lord; 
it also agrees with the portrait of Jesus Christ drawn by  Nicephorus, St. 
John Damascene, and the Book of Painters (of Mt. Athos).  Munter ("Die 
Sinnbilder und Kunstvorstellungen der alten Christen", Altona  1825, p. 9) believes 
he can trace the letter down to the time of  Diocletian; but this is not 
generally admitted. The letter of Lentulus is  certainly apocryphal: there 
never was a Governor of Jerusalem; no  Procurator of Judea is known to have 
been called Lentulus, a Roman  governor would not have addressed the Senate, 
but the emperor, a Roman  writer would not have employed the expressions, 
"prophet of truth", "sons  of men", "Jesus Christ". The former two are Hebrew 
idioms, the third is  taken from the New Testament. The letter, therefore, 
shows us a  description of our Lord such as Christian piety conceived him.  
Is the Letter for Publius Lentulus describing Christ  legitimate?
By John Baskette
The following is a translation of a two-page handwritten document I  came 
across Wed 5. Jan. 1994.  
Letter from First Consul Publius Lentuleis(?) to Caesar Tiberius  (reg. 14 
- 37 AD). The letter is partly an answer to a direct question  from the 
Caesar.  

There lives at this time in  Judea a man of singular virtue whose name is 
Jesus Christ, whom the  barbarians esteem as a prophet, but his followers 
love and adore him as  the offspring of the immortal God.  
He calls back the dead from the graves  and heals all sorts of diseases 
with a word or touch. He is a tall man,  well-shaped, and of an amiable and 
reverend aspect; his hair of a color  that can hardly be matched, falling into 
graceful curls, waving about  and very agreeable crouching upon his 
shoulders, parted on the crown of  the head, running as a stream to the front after 
fashion of the  Nazarites. His forehead high, large and imposing; his cheeks 
without  spot or wrinkle, beautiful with a lovely red; his nose and mouth 
formed  with exquisite symmetry; his beard, and of a color suitable to his 
hair,  reaching below his chin and parted in the middle like a fork; his eyes  
bright blue, clear and serene. Look innocent, dignified, manly and  mature. 
In proportion of body most perfect, and captivating; his arms  and hands 
delectable to behold.  
He rebukes with majesty, councils with  mildness, His whole address whether 
in word or deed, being eloquent and  grave. No man has seen him laugh, yet 
his manners are exceedingly  pleasant, but he has wept frequently in the 
presence of men. He is  temperate, modest and wise. A man for his extraordinary 
beauty and  perfection, surpassing the children of men in every sense.
