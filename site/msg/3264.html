<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bill,

Although i would love to take credit for that site with the step by 
step instructions, it&#x27;s not me.  Another member posted that on here, 
his name is Sum.  I was bored yesterday and bought a radio from 
radio shack and did the modification in my kitchen and only took a 
few moments to do.  I recorded a five minute session and got some 
good files from it, so i sent it to Sum to show him that the radio 
worked and thanked him for helping me with the mod.  He asked if he 
could use my files on that site that he was making ghostboxhack.com  
so i said sure.  I&#x27;m just a researcher, but after yesterday i feel i 
can do some basic stuff with electronics now.

&gt; Wow how cool is that? The step by step site made me feel smarter 
than
&gt; I should. I can&#x27;t wait till you post the keypad hack. And your
&gt; recordings are spot on! Thanks Steve. -Bill

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   It depends, i realized today i got an older version of that 
part #. 
&gt; &gt;   So, i had to pull the pin out, but the newer ones all you have 
to do 
&gt; &gt;   is cut the mute wire. I was pretty impressed myself, i have 
been 
&gt; &gt;   doing this for a while with several different methods and now 
i have 
&gt; &gt;   another. ITC never gets boring that&#x27;s for sure.

&gt; &gt;   &gt; Those responses sound very good. Time to go pick one up and 
see if 
&gt; &gt;   it works 
&gt; &gt;   &gt; for me ; )
&gt; &gt;   &gt; Which pin opens the mute circuit?

&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;I was bored today and went out and bought one of these, i&#x27;m 
gonna 
&gt; &gt;   post
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; some of my files from a 5 minute session testing it out. 
It was 
&gt; &gt;   less
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; than a ten minute modification to this radio shack radio 
and it 
&gt; &gt;   works
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; pretty good. Let me know what you think of these files.
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; Thanx Sum,
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; -Steve H.

&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;&gt; Just Hacked a radio shack model 12-469
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;&gt; Cut the Mute pin and presto a fm sweep cheap!
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;&gt; Cost 24.95 and about ten minutes time.
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s not expensive.
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll post the complete hack later this weekend!
