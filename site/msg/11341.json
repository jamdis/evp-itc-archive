This\nmodel is 12-150. I really would only do this hack as a last resort,\nit&#39;s a nightmare to get at the mute wire. It&#39;s more of the thrill of\nit for me, so this one is immediately going up for sale for whoever is\ninterested. It was $54 with tax plus tack on an extra $10 for shipping.\n\n\nThis radio peaked my interest because it has an extended range feature \nfor\nthose in a bad signal area.\n\n-Steve"}
