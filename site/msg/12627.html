<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Misty,

Thanks for the luck :-)  I am familiar with ufogeek&#x27;s YouTube videos
and he does provide a lot of information.  I had not heard of Steve
Hultay and will look him up when I get a chance.  I am familiar with
the Radio Shack hack radios and manual tune methods.  I still want to
build my own though :-)  I&#x27;m an EE and it&#x27;s kind of a pride thing. 
Plus, I can explain the data better if I&#x27;m using a device I actually
understand and can poke and prod as needed.  The dead zone is a good
idea and not something I&#x27;ve heard of before.  This might be a dumb
question, but has anyone experimented with pure (white, pink, etc.)
noise as a source for collecting EVP?

I look forward to hearing the samples you all have collected...

Anna

&gt; Hi Anna
&gt; 
&gt; Welcome to the group. Good luck on building your box. I guess the 
&gt; first easiest place to direct you would be Mike Coletta&#x27;s website. He 
&gt; has posted alot of DIY how-to videos for newbies on how to modify a 
&gt; radio yourself to work similar to Franks boxes. His youtube page has 
&gt; most of that stuff but his websites interesting to keep up with as 
&gt; well =) 
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; (Thanks for posting those again Mike)
&gt; 
&gt; While your on youtube you may want to check out some other peoples 
&gt; videos on how to modify an existing radio. Franks modified a number 
&gt; of different types as have others like Steve Hultay. Steve posted a 
&gt; list of the ones he&#x27;s been able to modify. Usually it requires 
&gt; nothing more than snipping  the mute wire. The archives on this group 
&gt; are a wealth of information just use the keyword search.
&gt; 
&gt; You also may want to try out manual sweep Most people find that 
&gt; brings in very good results. For manual sweep you are just sweeping 
&gt; the band. I prefer to use a radio with a knob dial. Then just start 
&gt; turning it back and forth across the band quickly so it doesnt have 
&gt; quite enough time to tune in any one radio station.
&gt; 
&gt; I also have had quite a bit of success using a dead zone spot in 
&gt; between any stations so that its set to off station and all I hear 
&gt; live is the radios static/whir. I have posted examples of some of 
&gt; these methods off my website.

&gt; Good luck on your quest!

&gt; &gt; Hi Everyone!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m new and I stumbled onto this group after doing some research
&gt; &gt; online into EVP.  I consider myself to be a paranormal skeptic, but 
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; have heard some very interesting EVP evidence and would like to look
&gt; &gt; into it further.  I joined this group because I am interested in
&gt; &gt; submitting EVP data to some rigorous scientific analysis.  I&#x27;m an
&gt; &gt; electrical engineer and mainly work in the areas of signal 
&gt; processing
&gt; &gt; and communications so all of this is extremely interesting.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am interested in collecting some of my own data (at some point) by
&gt; &gt; building a ghost box based on Frank Sumption&#x27;s designs.  I am 
&gt; working
&gt; &gt; from the &quot;Ghost Box Notebook&quot; from 2007, but I am having a hard time
&gt; &gt; getting started.  Has anyone built one of these and are there any
&gt; &gt; parts lists or more complete schematics floating around? I would
&gt; &gt; appreciate any build help or advice any of you might have.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anna
