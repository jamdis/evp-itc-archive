I have no real advice to add to this topic: but a thought that came to me w=
hile reading your messages.

What if there is 'crime' in the ethereal as we=
ll as our physical world (from the good vs evil idea) ... and maybe an ener=
gy can possess or draw from another less powerful energy and 'change' it?

=
What do you think?
