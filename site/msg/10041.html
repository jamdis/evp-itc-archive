transmitter .. 
&gt; Honestly .. I have no clue what I&#x27;m doing yet .. I will post

did

&gt; &gt; I formally thought &quot;hoax,&quot; too, until I found how easy it is for 
&gt; &gt; ghosts/spirits, etc to use these different devices we have today 
to 
&gt; &gt; communicate through.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It&#x27;s almost as if the ability to talk to the other side has been 
&gt; &gt; there the whole time, or better yet, that the other side has 
been 
&gt; &gt; communicating with us the whole time, but we simply needed to 
&gt; &gt; become &quot;awakened&quot; to it...

&gt; &gt; &gt; When I first listened to the Spiricom samples several years 
ago, 
&gt; my 
&gt; &gt; immediate impression was: Hmm, it sounds like someone using 
&gt; &gt; an &quot;electronic larynx&quot; (speech aid device). This impression was 
&gt; &gt; strengthened by the observation that the buzzing sound often was 
&gt; even 
&gt; &gt; modulated by O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s own voice during the dialoges between him 
&gt; &gt; and &quot;Dr. Mueller&quot;! (Did O&#x27;Neill forget to remove the device from 
&gt; his 
&gt; &gt; throat while talking to his counterpart?)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; And what about the &quot;13 frequencies&quot; that are supposed to be 
used 
&gt; as 
&gt; &gt; the &quot;carrier&quot; for the spirit voices? Why aren&#x27;t they audible in 
the 
&gt; &gt; recordings? And why does a mixture of the 13 tones created with 
&gt; &gt; Audition sound so different from the typical &quot;Spiricom buzz&quot;? - 
&gt; Well, 
&gt; &gt; if you analyze the frequency spectrum of the buzzing sound (this 
&gt; can 
&gt; &gt; be done with Audition etc.), you will find a lot of harmonics 
&gt; (peaks 
&gt; &gt; in the spectrum), and some of these harmonics more or less match 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; 13 Spiricom frequencies...
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; To me, the entire Spiricom saga produces more questions than 
&gt; &gt; answers...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks Guy, I have heard a few people mention that O&#x27;Neil 
&gt; hoaxed 
&gt; &gt; it 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I don&#x27;t know enough about this to really pass any sort 
of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; judgement.  Looking forward to seeing your website.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In regards to the Spiricom story - I have to assume you&#x27;re 
&gt; &gt; referring to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Mark IV model as diagrammed/written up in the Spiricom 
&gt; &gt; manual (as 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opposed to the INCORRECT diagram made by Polish researcher 
&gt; &gt; Wojciech 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Drewniak...http://www.worlditc.org/k_06_spiricom.htm ).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While my research is still not finished (and I&#x27;ve been 
&gt; working 
&gt; &gt; on this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a little over 2 years), I&#x27;m leaning toward the Mark IV 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conversations as having been hoaxed by Bill O&#x27;Neil. 
HOWEVER - 
&gt; I 
&gt; &gt; believe 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he acted alone and that none of the other members of the 
&gt; &gt; Metascience 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Foundation were involved with this hoax. As to O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s 
&gt; &gt; motivation for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the hoax - I still don&#x27;t know. But I will also say that 
the 
&gt; &gt; veridical 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evidence that O&#x27;Neil claims to have received about Dr. 
George 
&gt; &gt; J. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mueller through clairaudience is amazing and it is tough 
to 
&gt; see 
&gt; &gt; how 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; O&#x27;Neil would have gotten this information given his 
finances, 
&gt; &gt; location, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the timeframe, etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;ve been promising to get my personal website up and 
&gt; operating 
&gt; &gt; for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some time now but have been busy. Hopefully soon. Then 
I&#x27;ll 
&gt; &gt; start 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; posting what I have found out so far.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; P.S. The recordings of the Spiricom cassette that can be 
&gt; found 
&gt; &gt; at the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GOS website ( 
&gt; http://www.ghostpix.com/spiricom/spiricom.html ) 
&gt; &gt; are very 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; poor. Scott L over at Ghostly Talk pulled much a much 
cleaner 
&gt; &gt; version 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; directly from a source cassette provided to him by Mark 
Macy 
&gt; ( 
&gt; &gt; see 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ghostly Talk show archive noted as a &quot;Bonus&quot; and &quot;Repost&quot;
