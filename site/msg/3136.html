<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi All,
This is my first post, as I just joined this group. I have been 
researching the subject of Ghost Boxes for the last week or so and 
came across this great group.  I need go nowhere else!
So much discussion on this very interesting topic.
The reason I was researching is, I will be talking about Ghost Boxes 
(Frank&#x27;s Box, Joe&#x27;s Box, Ron&#x27;s Mini Box) on my BlogTalkRadio show on 
Tuesday (tomorrow) at 7 PM Mountain Time. I live in Colorado Springs, 
not too far from Frank Sumption I&#x27;m guessing.
In case you want to listen to the show LIVE at 7 PM (PT) tomorrow, 
it&#x27;s at: http://www.blogtalkradio.com/ufogeek
You can also listen after that when it&#x27;s archived.  Last week&#x27;s show 
has received over 900 listeners so far.  I talked a bit about the 
Spiricom Mark IV last week.
I have never used any Ghost Box, but I have experimented with my own 
design, and a friend and I are kicking around a small device, with 
maybe only 3 IC chips or so.  Right now it&#x27;s just on the drawing 
board.
Anyway... thanks for hearing me out.  Again, the url for the show is:
