2) Why don't you get on the box, and do some asking? 

As I have said in th=
e past, my experience with those boxes has shown me nothing 
paranormal yet=
.=C2=A0 However, people continue to say there is more to it than my 
experi=
ence.=C2=A0 And so, I am keeping an open mind and trying to examine the 
ev=
idence you provide.

Well well...there it is! you have not had any luck on =
the box so right away it 
doesn't work. Or there has to be a some foul play=
 involved. If I could suggest 
you find someone who does has had many sessi=
on with the box and sit in. But I'm 
sure you would find some excuse why it=
 saying whats its saying...what's your 
take on it wait don't tell me...cb =
radio lol

 Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: depressing,

=C2=A0 
You asked several questions, so I'l=
l take them one at a time:

1) you hope what? that i made a fool out of mys=
elf or that i called it in or 
perhaps both?=C2=A0 


I hope you called it =
in. Your resistance to giving the police information you 
said you thought =
you had on a child abductor, even after several prompts, makes 
me hope you=
 did call it in, and didn't just say that to stop me from prompting 
you. I=
 don't know of course, I am not there. I have no desire that you make a 
fo=
ol of yourself, but if it helps save a child from am abductor, I think it 
=
would be worth it.

2) Why don't you get on the box, and do some asking? 

=
As I have said in the past, my experience with those boxes has shown me not=
hing 
paranormal yet.=C2=A0 However, people continue to say there is more t=
o it than my 
experience.=C2=A0 And so, I am keeping an open mind and tryin=
g to examine the 
evidence you provide.

3) Why are negative people on thes=
e lists anyway. if you guys don't believe in 
this type of technology, why =
the heck are you all here? 


If I had absolulely no belief that there migh=
t be something interesting going on 
with the technology, I would not have =
been so insistent that you give your 
information to the police.=C2=A0 How =
could a person, of good conscience, not prompt 
you to give that informatio=
n to the police?=C2=A0 Again how is that a negative thing 
to do?

Wouldn't=
 the really negative thing be to ignore it?

i could just call them, and say i heard it from a psychic or something, at =

 how he would get that little boy out of a tent, with the whole sleeping fa=
