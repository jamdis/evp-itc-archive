I have found quite a few voices that I  \nwouldn&#39;t have noticed hadn&#39;t I first heard a &quot;pop&quot; sound. Actually had to do  \nsome MAJOR enhancing on 2 of them to even hear them at all. I mean one was  \nimpossibly buried in the noise. But after slowing it down I got a &quot;wiff&quot; of \n it, and through more passes of the Audacity effects I was rewarded with a  \nfemale voice. It was sad though...she said in a mechanical pattern &quot;can - \nyou  - help- me.........please - help. Still, the audio is so painfully low.  \nHearing her plea will forever effect me. Hopefully I can find someoneone \nhere  that can hear them as well as I. That can verify this for me :) I hear  \nit...but is nice to know someone else is there with you :) I went back to \nthat  location little over an hour later (after found the voice) Is under 1 \nmile  from me. It&#39;s a real sad thing to hear and not knowing what to do.Jim H  \n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n_Compete with the big boys.
