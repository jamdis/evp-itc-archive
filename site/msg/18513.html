Unfortunately Mr Wegrzyn, your threats to=
 me constitute criminal harassment.=C2=A0 
Here's what you said:

"Get off =
Franks back...Or I'll find you and you dont want that...get with it or 
GET=
 LOST...Thats my opion,let me know Frank and I'll take a road trip.I got la=
id 
off today and I'm in the mood to screw something or someone up !!!!!"

=
Mr Wegrzyn. did you mean that threat? I am considering filing a police repo=
rt, 
but I am willing to give you a chance to reexplain what you meant, or =
take it 
back, since as you said, you did get laid off and all.

<DIV> Same old thing, heard them talking about=
 "it hits the earth" again last night while testing one of those single sup=
ply dual sweep boxes, so set up a hack radio I had handy. "--BehindTheSun--=
ComesFarFromEarth--(jack-frag)IsComin'--Session-EarthWillThenCollide-ItEnds=
--Comet-Good(?)". The jack thing is Jack FM, 105.5 FM a rock station. Presu=
mable 2012. The December 21st date from the Mayans seems to be a middl=
e number, there's like a window right around Christmas, as they seem to men=
tion the 17th along with this stuff. Who knows if it means anything, but wh=
at I don't like are those that profess to "know better". </DIV>
