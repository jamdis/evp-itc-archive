I am slow at acomplishing my goals and\ngot distracted by reports of Frank Sumption&#39;s radio scanning\nbreakthroughs. They have come about by his energetic development\nefforts and hours at the workbench.\n\nWell, I&#39;ve settled on a construction project of a simple VHF receiver\nthat can be adjusted to tune the FM broadcast band or the AM aircraft\nband that has airport pilot chatter. I plan to include a voltage\ntuning diode that can be scanned with the ramp voltage from an free\nrunning LTC555 timer IC. The whole thing should be inexpensive to\nduplicate and hopefully allow spirit message retrival from these\nbands. I will certainly post the results here as they come in.\n\nI&#39;ve assembled two Olympus c-2040 zoom cameras to take stereoscopic\nphotos with infrared filters. \n\nI&#39;ve designed an infrared sensitive thermistor circuit with a visible\nLED indicator that will light if incident heat is blocked by a heat\nabsorbing mass. The sensors are to be arranged in a styrofoam panel to\noutline shadow shapes cast on its surface. I have an infrared shop\nheater to radiate toward the sensor matrix panel.\n\nI&#39;ll try to concentrate on the radio project and get it working!\n\nMore later,\n\nJoe"}
