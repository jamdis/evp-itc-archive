&gt; Same old stuff, one&#x27;s opinion is absolute gospel, and if I, or anyone
&gt; points out the facts we are just the worst bastards that ever lived!
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;ve told everyone for years that asking questions results in unreliable
&gt; informatrion, and when I asked questions to try to get more information I
&gt; got pure BS. But since that contradicts all the real box experts out there,
&gt; who insist that they alone know how to ask the right qquestions, and I must
&gt; be somkind of idiot moron. I just invented this crap, how could I possibly
&gt; understand how it works!? No, leave that to some duffus that assembles
&gt; messages to be the real expert.
&gt;
&gt; At least I&#x27;m honest enough to tell people I tried the &quot;asccepted&quot; method of
&gt; box use and it&#x27;s crap.

&gt; &gt; Zack,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I do not meen to offend anyone but I do not think just because you are a
&gt; person who started this forum that you have the rite to insult and offend
&gt; people for speaking there opinion.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is that not what this and other groups are about. someone else said the
&gt; rules here are if you are insulting or mean then you will be baned does that
&gt; not go for every one or is it just a few people can say what they want and
&gt; others will be baned ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I said I did not meen to insult anyone but I feel there is an injustuce
&gt; here and favoratsm wich is wrong in any group.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; why is it do as i say not as i do. the rules should be for everyone no
&gt; matter what. if you aply this thinking to every thing we would be living in
&gt; a world were people were in prison for doing a crime and the people in
&gt; goverment could do as they please to sell drugs or kill or whatever and get
&gt; away with it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; we should not have to be USED TO someone who can akt and insult who ever
&gt; he wants too when ever he wants too.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; that is my opinion.
&gt; &gt; pleese forgive my english.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; Well, it&#x27;s his group (he doesn&#x27;t own it now but he started it) and he&#x27;s
&gt; the one who invented the box and builds them and supplies us with all the
&gt; info on them. His name is Frank Sumption.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Those of us who have been around here half of forever are used to him and
&gt; aren&#x27;t offended.

&gt; &gt; &gt;I am sorry but I do not think it is aceptible for this FS to call

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;on another group this would not be tolerated the person would be warned
&gt; on the group and then asked to leave. I have seen this with a few people
&gt; here and since I spoke up before I hope I will not be insulted.
