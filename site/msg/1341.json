I am a ghosthunter and I have had great success in recording\n&gt;EVP&#39;s recently. I have included a link to one of our recent\n&gt;investigations and recorded an EVP at a restaurant that said &quot;Say\n&gt;Goodbye!&quot; as an investigator and myself were walking away from the\n&gt;area.This is an authentic EVP.\n&gt;\n&gt;It came from a cassette tape and has not been altered or filtered in\n&gt;the least. I have been an active ghosthunter for about 3 years now.\n&gt;Here is the link. Would like to know what you all think of it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.arizonaparanormalinvestigations.com/MSG.htm\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Question: I am noticing a strange echo reverberation when I record\n&gt;loud EVP&#39;s. When I record &quot;whisper&quot; type EVP&#39;s I don&#39;t get this echo.\n&gt;\n&gt;What do you all think casuses this strange echo quality?\n&gt;\n&gt;Look forward to talking to all of you!\n&gt;\n&gt;James\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet a preview of Live Earth, the hottest event this summer - only on MSN \nhttp://liveearth.msn.com?source=msntaglineliveearthhm"}
