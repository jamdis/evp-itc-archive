I don&#39;t use my Joe&#39;s boxes much\nand need to sell them, they are $300/each for those who are\ninterested. Money is tight and i need to get rid of some stuff to buy\nmore stuff...and also pay bills.  Joe&#39;s box is an FM sweep radio \nprototype that got me started in EVP-ITC.  I have audio from the joe&#39;s \nbox in my folder in the files section.\n\nLet me know,\n-Steve H."}
