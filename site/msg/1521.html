#13 Doesnt look so ugly to me Frank. I think it would be cool if it had the option for both but not a necessity. Is #12 the one you got my name/voice on? "this is Misty Dawn" I still have that sound clip saved hehehe I cant remember but the sound files had 12 at the start of it and i think thats how you were numbering them at one point. I kinda remember 13's tests but it wasnt around long enough to gather much info. Was around the time when we tested video itc.
   
  Anyway heres the that file from that box 12 if it was indeed as labled. Oh and if it is 12 then when u fix that one let's play with it a bit before it goes anywhere LOL.

piece of copper clad board in an effort to reduce size. One drawback with 
this box is it's AC powered, so not portable to places wihtout power--like 
grave yards, so I might convert it. I have one more of these, #12, but the 
tuner needs to be replaced.
