namecalling and fighting!!&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yeah, I am the master! But... 
that&#x27;s only when the Ol&#x27; Lady ain&#x27;t looking over my shoulder! I have 
to tell everyone--she&#x27;s pissed!!!! Way too much time in the basement, 
and way to much money spent on something she considers useless. I&#x27;m 
rushing on yet another proto type, one that gets rid of random mode, 
and has all functions, linear, with direct voice mode, or though a 
sound chamber. Then---it&#x27;s time to play with tones. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Random 
mode, depsite the professed theory out there, no longer works for me, 
maybe it&#x27;s psychological, but the damn circuits won&#x27;t even function. 
Random in the #24 box would not work at all at the Stanley, so I&#x27; am 
abandoning that function. I know what Moon claims about the raw 
having to be random--simply not true, that was based on my 
assumptions about how the box worked in the early days of 
boxology. &quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frank-S&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;To: EVP-ITC@: bulletbabea@: Sun, 2

ALL members of this group,&gt; &gt;I agree with Steve. Ive told you all 
this many times yet some of you like to get caught up in the heat of 
the moment.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;It is very disturbing to watch you all try to win 
this war of words. There is no winner just a bunch of losers. And 
while you are busy losing theres no GOOD research being performed by 
YOU.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;How much research did YOU do today? How much time did you 
spend firing off replies to attempt to respond to someone you dont 
even know about something that doesnt even involve YOU? How much time 
did you spend replying to join in the arguments you feel do involve 
YOU?&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The point being, this is a research group for ITC not a 
boxing room and definitely your own personal battlegrounds. Take that 
elsewhere. Healthy discussion is one thing but I have seen very few 
people offering that. In fact I know a few of you joined here just to 
go after someone who ticked you off. Then there are those who just 
seem to be firing in all directions, taget doesnt matter.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Get a 
grip people!! Ive seen 4 year olds with more self control. If you 
arent interested in researching ITC for yourself then what the heck 
are YOU doing HERE. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ONCE AGAIN THIS IS AN ITC RESEARCH GROUP!! 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As for the box Frank is and always has been the first/primary 
tester of any box he has built. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lol&gt; &gt;Misty&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;P.S. I think 
you all are capable of finding better things to do, if not let me 
know and I will give you a few ideas =)&gt; &gt;Steve Hultay &lt;urkel23@&gt; 
wrote:&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I think we should all focus at the research at hand 
and forget what everyone else is doing. I personally know Chris and 
think he&#x27;s a great guy and frank feels the same way most days. This 
has gotten to the point where i can&#x27;t even do a session anymore 
because i&#x27;m so blocked by negative thoughts from this group it&#x27;s 
pointless to concentrate on the box and get results. Honestly who 
cares what chris does anyway, does it really affect everyone&#x27;s lives 
that much. I have a job and this is a hobby that i used to really 
like, but now this board has brought me down. It seems all people 
want to do is make this like a street fight with challenges and 
negative views and for what reason? If anyone is concerned about 
hearing Chris&#x27;s audio, i have about 2 hours of box sessions from 
Eastern State on my web site for all to listen to. It&#x27;s 
www.keyportparanormal.com and go to investigation and click on 
eastern state. All the audio is at the bottom of that page and you 
guys can judge for yourself and i heard a lot come out of that box 
that night personally because i repeated a lot of stuff back to chris 
that i heard. Enough already, let&#x27;s move on to the next great thing. 
That radio shack hack was a great breakthrough here, let&#x27;s just be 
happy we got that before it was shut down. Now we have another avenue 
to go down, but we can&#x27;t do it with all these negatives out there. 
Let&#x27;s move on to new topics and anyone out there that bought a Radio 
Shack box, start sharing your files with the group so it&#x27;s not just 
us same 5 that post all the time.-Steve H.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Be a better sports 
nut! Let your teams follow you with Yahoo Mobile. Try it now. &gt; &gt; &gt;
