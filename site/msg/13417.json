I was wrong. Door=\r\n to the Dead has exceeded my worst expectations.\n\n            Generally, I =\r\nrespect John Oliver&#39;s work as a medium. While I have no personal experience=\r\n with him, in the past he has looked and acted more genuine than not, the r=\r\nolling of the eyes put aside for the moment.\n\n            I do take excepti=\r\non to the characterization of the talking box as an Edison device. I have d=\r\nocumented the history of Edison, ITC and EVP  elsewhere. This is however th=\r\ne smallest concern I have with this show.\n\n            Prior to wathcing I =\r\nhad just had a conversation with a respected colleague on the West coast re=\r\ngarding interesting phenomena he and others are constantly observing in sit=\r\nes with phenomena similar to that on Door to the Dead. None of those measur=\r\nements were made by this team. The use of thermal in this situation is not =\r\nindicated as well.\n\n            The real concern is that no attempt was mad=\r\ne to help this family in a broader context. The skeptic did and said nothin=\r\ng skeptical as far as I could tell. Key questions were not asked (at least =\r\non-camera) that would reveal the psycho-dynamics of this family. We know fa=\r\nirly well at this time that PK phenomena is often centered on a focal perso=\r\nn who can exhibit specific characteristics. That the team seems unaware of =\r\nthis is quite disturbing to a person like myself.\n\n            A real resea=\r\nrch opportunity was lost in this case, as was an opportunity to educate the=\r\n public on the right way to approach such situations. Continually sending t=\r\nhe messages that phenomena is based on &#39;demons&#39; and &#39;spirits&#39; exclusively d=\r\noes nothing to further the position of serious investigators, which is perh=\r\naps most troubling of all.\n\n       \n\n\n  \r\n------=_NextPart_000_012C_01C98EAD.FDF6B4E0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.=\r\nw3c.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-eq=\r\nuiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META conte=\r\nnt=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6001.18203&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY style=3D&quot;BACKG=\r\nROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;Comic S=\r\nans MS&quot;&gt;Hey Jeff!!!!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;Comic=\r\n Sans MS&quot;&gt;&nbsp; Nice to see ya again :) Hows it \ngoing down there?
