<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s called &quot;evidence.&quot; Heard of it? All this talk about the Fish  
Group is predicated on things that happened to other people. Ever  
played Chinese Telephones? Without the original EVP files, then its  
all a case of third-fourth-eight-hand testimony, slowly blowing out  
of proportion and reaching legendary status before you can say &quot;Bob&#x27;s  
your uncle.&quot; If there never was any EVP evidence we&#x27;d not even be  
calling them the Fish Group. They gave that name to themselves,  
through EVPs. If you don&#x27;t accept EVP as good--if not the best-- 
evidence we have of paranormal communication, why are you here?

Some of us here have trying to approach this research in a logical  
and basically scientific way for many years. I, a least, will not  
start rolling in imaginative speculation on anyone&#x27;s whim.

&gt; What difference would a recording make? Especially
&gt; Since in this research where we usually can&#x27;t see who or what
&gt; we&#x27;re talking to. Any voice we hear or record could be anything.

&gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve heard of this as well, but my question was, do we have any  
&gt;&gt; EVP evidence that the *Fish Group* ever claimed to be other than  
&gt;&gt; dead people?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wisteria,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I forgot but you may be quite right! There are spirits who have  
&gt;&gt;&gt; never been incarnated into human form. They tend not to be  
&gt;&gt;&gt; involved in any way with lower forms of vibration.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Edgar Cayce spoke of them. Their souls were created as the moment  
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Creation. They chose not to have ever incarnated. Since their  
&gt;&gt;&gt; vibration level is far more than a lowly entity, I highly doubt  
&gt;&gt;&gt; that they would interact with lower entities. They are on a  
&gt;&gt;&gt; completely different level of existence.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I just said that in reference to Al&#x27;s comments. There are a  
&gt;&gt;&gt; cluster of researchers who insist on tagging religious myth on  
&gt;&gt;&gt; research... angels, devils, heaven, hell, assuming anything  
&gt;&gt;&gt; visiting our plane is &quot;stuck&quot; and needs &quot;saving&quot; and ignoring  
&gt;&gt;&gt; other energies assuming everything they hear is or was a human  
&gt;&gt;&gt; mortal.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I&#x27;ve heard from many energies claiming to be many things and  
&gt;&gt;&gt; some never having inhabited a body.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I said that because all of the examples I heard of EVP by the  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fish Group has sounded very human and they have never claimed to  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have been other than human that I have heard. I have to base my  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conclusions on the EVP files, not speculation, even from the  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; victims. Do you know of instances where they audibly claimed to  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be nonhuman? I may have missed them--I heard a lot of EVPs from  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them, but certainly not the sum total. (As I said--I even got  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one myself the other day.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you&#x27;re right that they are definitely mobile, and a  
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; collective.
