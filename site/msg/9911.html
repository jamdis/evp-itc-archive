<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>hi everyone,


I have been following the posts about voice to text experiments with 
the allophones program.



I had done some research and experiments with the speech to text 
feature supplied with Microsoft office.



I found that because all speech to text programs that are currently 
available are based on the users voice , speech pattern.

and must be trained by the user to be able to recognise the 
individual users phonetic pattern. Such as accent, dialect and 
general pronunciation.



The current speech to text software available today could not learn 
from or accomodate training from basic allophones tones.

It must be taught to recognize Particular human speech patterns.



I had trained the speech to text program extensively and had hoped it 
would be able to use the spirit words formed from the radio

fragments coming from a box, because they where based and 
manufactured by fragments of human speech.

But to no avail. the program would only accept my personal voice 
pattern and even then needed to be retrained periodically.



These programs where basically designed for stenographic purposes and 
to be used by secretaries and stenographers.

I experimented for months with this idea and never received one 
spirit message in text.
