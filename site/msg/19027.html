<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Interesting... I&#x27;m actually familiar with the word &quot;urchin&quot; from reading old books, but I always assumed it was pronounced  with a &quot;ch&quot; as in &quot;choochoo train&quot;... I guess there are various pronounciations!

Thanks!

&gt; It&#x27;s spelled &quot;urchin&quot; and it&#x27;s a term you hardly ever see used anymore. It
&gt; means &quot;a street child&quot; and was sometimes used as a term of affection.
&gt; 
&gt; I once asked &quot;Do you want us to leave?&quot; on an investigation and got a
&gt; response &quot;You just got here.&quot;

&gt; &gt; See endoffilewow.mp3 in my files folder. This was the very end of the
&gt; &gt; session my husband and I did at night in Charles Town, WV cemetery, on
&gt; &gt; October 15.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Notice:
&gt; &gt; A man whose voice persists through several seconds of the file saying...
&gt; &gt; &quot;you...too...erchin...wonderful&quot; what the heck is erchin, lol! Here you
&gt; &gt; should also notice that between &quot;erchin&quot; and &quot;wonderful&quot; there is a definite
&gt; &gt; station change &quot;whine&quot; sound...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Then you may also notice when I ask &quot;Should we come back ever?&quot; A lady
&gt; &gt; says, &quot;Ever?&quot; or &quot;Never&quot; can tell which....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We&#x27;re getting some pretty convincing stuff for having been doing less than
&gt; &gt; a month.
