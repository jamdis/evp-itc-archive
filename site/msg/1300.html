These are from a few days ago (attached to this post for new members you need to set status to "individual email" setting for the group to get attachments). I decided since I downloaded some of Edison's historical speech to compare to my evp voice that I wondered what I would get if I threw one of those into evpmaker. I got a little more than I thought I would. It even made me have to google to look up the meaning of one of the technical words LOL
   
  I also included the evp vs life speech side by side comparison with the evp I got from ST method. Since thats how this started and for those who just joined group and have no idea what I am talkin about.
