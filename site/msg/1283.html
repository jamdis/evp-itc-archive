<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just as an aside, Misty--I&#x27;ve heard recordings of Edison&#x27;s voice and  
this struck me right away as a very similar one. Each time I listen  
to it, I feel more strongly that it could be him.

The third recording &quot;We have conscious...&quot; is equally as amazing.

Wonderful stuff!
