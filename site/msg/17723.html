<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, if someone is doing this &quot;work&quot; as their sole source of income, I don&#x27;t fault them, and there does seem to be a market, and no shortage of people seeking readings. 

 One thing is certain, no Moon==no boxes. It was Moon that got this technology/technique out in the public. Also worth mentioning is Bill Chappell, who came up with the hack version.

&gt; Mr Moon hosts seminars, at which, you may see him do public demonstrations.  But if you want a private reading.... $$$ (I&#x27;ve heard several hundred dollars an hour, with discounts to conference atendees).
&gt; 
&gt; So one suspects the public demonstrations probably help to acquire private clientele.

&gt;       
&gt;       
&gt;       Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you, Frank!  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; And, to answer a reference to money: My experience with Chris Moon didn&#x27;t cost a cent.  In fact, the box spoke to me from across a large room -- I&#x27;d guess about 20 or 30 feet away and from a platform about 10 feet above me -- in a distinctive voice and speech pattern that I recognized immediately.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;d asked a rhetorical question. The box answered. That rattled me, big time.  After that, I stuck close to the box.  I wanted to hear more.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; However, at no time did this involve payment of any kind.  In fact, innate skeptic that I am (having been badly burned by one regrettable association), I watched Chris and Dina closely during the weekend.  I saw zero hustling or salesmanship. They never asked me for money, and have never asked me to talk about my experiences with the box.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; My interest in the boxes and this list are unabashedly self-serving:  I want to understand why some devices work better than others, why some of us hear them more clearly than others, who the voices really are (if they&#x27;re not who they seem to be), and the significance of what they&#x27;re saying.  I want to hear more.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#x27;t have the expertise to build a box, and I can&#x27;t afford to hire someone to build one for me, right now.  So, I&#x27;m on this list, listening vicariously to others&#x27; experiences and recordings.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#x27;m grateful for those who share their insights, experiences, thoughts on how we can understand this stuff better, and the recordings of voices that keep talking &amp; talking.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again, Frank!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Relieved,
&gt; 
&gt; Fiona

&gt; &gt;  Well, I was very reluctant, despite all the insults and attacks, but I hit the banned button.
