<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank,

In your first clip, I also hear &quot;Not&quot; before bad work.
I heard 90% of your second clip the way you heard it.
The last clip I heard as you did.

But what intrigues me most is the &quot;I wanna fuck him&quot; clip.  I recorded the
same type of message yesterday with a Sangean hack and I got something about
&quot;Princess,&quot; which is something I almost never record.

:09 &quot;Tim&quot;
:16 &quot;I can&#x27;t find her the Princess&quot;
:23 &quot;Hey ya know I fucked ya.&quot;
:26 &quot;Andy&quot;
:34 &quot;You&#x27;re psycho shut-up&quot;
:42 &quot;We talk over radio&quot;

There is also talk at the beginning about 10 million people disappearing and
at about :20, there is a brief piece of language which is not human, at
least not any human language I have ever heard before.

Tim
