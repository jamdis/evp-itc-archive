That \nway, you were  in control of the origi=\r\nnal image during the entire test, not \nme. \n\nThe  password for that file is=\r\n: 123BlastOff\nInstructions, if you need them, are  also in that RJ folder.\n=\r\n\nAnd if you did not care to download the zip  file before the test, I will =\r\n\npost the final image there too.\n\nSo to the  results:\n\nNumber of participan=\r\nts: 5\nTotal tries: 8\nAmbiguous  answers: 0\nCorrect answers: 0\n\nObject: A ra=\r\ndio\nUzipped  picture:\n_http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/=\r\nRJ.20100710.1.JPG_ \n(http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ=\r\n.20100710.1.JPG) \n\nSo  what do the results mean? All that we can really agr=\r\nee on from this \nexperiment  is that no participant, with whatever theories=\r\n or methods or \ntechnology they  used, was able to correctly determine the =\r\nobject. We can&#39;t say \nthose theories  or methods or technologies never work=\r\n. Just as we can&#39;t say \nthey do. Just  that, for whatever reason, they did =\r\nnot work this time.
