 Well this'll go over like a fart church, I thought this was private e-mai=

 I think I'll start making a distinction betwe=
en the typical paranormal investigator moron, and ITC. The paranormal twits=
 seem to have no concept of what spirit acutally is, and how it's possible =
to communicate. I'm tired to arguing with the idiots. I can't get past thei=
r huge egos to make teh point that it's not white noise, and spirits can tr=
avel. I just had another go round with one of Rosemary Guiley's friends, he=
