  I think that you are posting mostly spirit comunication, but it will take time for you to figure out what is spirit comunication, and radio fragments.  I think you doing great, and it will all come in time.  "You will get your ears soon" the more you listen the more you catch in real time, and the more messages you hear. I've been doing this research for a few month and it still hard for me to hear sometimes.  I have ask a couple of people in this group for help hearing what I've recorded, and they always have listen and responded to my files, and they would help you too, if you need it.
