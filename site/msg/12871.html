Misty,
I would like to be allowed to respond to mike colletta in a professional
and civil manner
I promise a well worded and truthful rebuttal.
Bruce &lt;&lt;

Bruce,

I almost decided to let you do that but then I thought about it. I also 
remembered past issues. It&#x27;s fine if you want to respond. In fact I 
think I have no right to deny you to do that. However I do have a right 
to keep you guys from duking it out HERE in this forum. It has been 
disrupted enough with the petty arguments. So find another place to 
have your word wars because most of the members here are NOT involved 
and should not be subjected to such displays of ego.

I&#x27;m sorry but I have to deny your request for membership again. 
Normally I would email this to you personally but I want everyone here 
to know that this type of behavior is no longer tolerated. I just do 
not have time to be referee to peoples personal squabbles. So if you 
are here to research and learn then no problem. That is what this forum 
is for. If you are here just to be a negative influence then please 
take it somewhere else. This forum is not a battle ground. 
________________
Mike, 

I understand why the conflict made you want to post here but again this 
is not the place for it. As I stated before most of the members here 
are not involved in this conflict and shouldnt have to be subjected to 
two grown men duking it out over something that they had no part in or 
even knew about. Most are here to learn and share and move forward. 
________________
Everyone Else,
Up til now this has been a free posting forum and nobody has been 
moderated. However that could change so please rethink your actions 
before posting here. 

So post it on your websites, start your own forums with your own rules 
that allow someone to be &quot;victorious&quot;. I see no victory in this for 
either side and having said that I wish you all well in your research. 

Misty</pre>
