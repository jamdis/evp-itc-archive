If I remember, one of the early\nengineers behind the Moog synthesizer helped development of the Spiricom.\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;lil_piggsy&quot; &lt;piggsy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I forgot how many discrete tones were used in the Spiricom. IIRC, the\n&gt; theory of operation was all of the tones and harmonics were combined\n&gt; to create voices. The recorded output was somewhat hard for me to\n&gt; understand due to all of those tones. Now what if the discrete tones\n&gt; could somehow be filtered out of the output, allowing only processed\n&gt; voice to pass through? I&#39;m sure the circuitry would be very\n&gt; complicated. This is probably just the Ny-Quil talking though.\n&gt; Electronic engineering is beyond the scope of my knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good Night!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That would be interesting, a hardware version of evp maker that would\n&gt; &gt; sample the voice of a person speaking into a mic onto a memory chip.\n&gt; &gt; Then slice,scramble, and play back that persons voice. It would be an\n&gt; &gt; alternative to a tuner and to the RNG concept, which is also good. The\n&gt; &gt; RNG idea Frank S proposed reminds me of Spiricom if you use tone\n&gt; &gt; generators that mimic the human voice. \n&gt; &gt; -Bill\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
