<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s weird how many of these messages you get.  The only reason I question
them is that they keep changes the month on you, but it always seems to be
between may-august in their messages.

The solar system is exceedingly active this month, way more so than usual.
 On October 8 - 10 - 12- 13 - 14 - 16 - 17 there are asteroids that are real
close to Earths orbit, and on October 20th, Comet Hartley 2 will be about 45
times the Earth-Moon distance from the Earth (or about 17.7 million
kilometers).  Which is pretty close in space distance.

&gt;  I screwed up, I thought I plugged the box in to the recorder mic input,
&gt; but had it in the headphone jack, so this was recorded open air, off the
&gt; speaker. Sometimes ya get clearer voices like that. Others have gotten
&gt; voices having to do with Seven.
