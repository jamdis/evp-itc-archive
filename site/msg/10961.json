Thanks. \n\n Frank-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Marlboro63@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Good morning Frank,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I started my Sunday morning ritual off differently this morning by \ncoming  \n&gt; downstairs and getting coffer, firing up the laptop and having a \nsmoke in the  \n&gt; only place my wife will let me smoke in my house.  Boy it sure \nfeels good  this \n&gt; morning.  And the first thing I do when I check my mail is check  \nmy mail and \n&gt; listen to your file.  I listen to all your files but I do not  \nalways \n&gt; respond.  I am always amazed at the communication you receive.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I was especially impressed about these files.  They were very \nclear  and made \n&gt; complete sentences.  The second file in the zip just blew me out  \nof the \n&gt; water.  Especially after listening to it over and over again I \nwas  astounded.  I \n&gt; especially liked the last word in the second file.  A  lot of us \nhave received \n&gt; files with your name in it which is nothing new to any  of us.  \nBut for you \n&gt; to receive a file with my name in it.  It is the  last word said \nin the second \n&gt; file following the statements.  I just want to  thank you for \nputting that out \n&gt; there so that I could hear it.other people have  gotten my name \nbefore but \n&gt; that is only because they have asked direct questions  and my name \nhas come up.  \n&gt; In your file it was just stated.  And for  that I thank you.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thank you again,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **************Wondering what&#39;s for Dinner Tonight?
