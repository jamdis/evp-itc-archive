Boy I really hate to start a flame war so forgive me but I have to be clear=

in what I said.

I said that Satan was/is a real entity but in God's emplo=
y.

He is not a made up character of the early church But I do agree
that t=
he early church "converted" Satan to a thing to be feared.

We already said t=
hat, but it was also stated that Satan is a made up character of the early =
Church to instill fear and use that fear to control the masses. It worked w=
ell for the Peruvians, so the early Church copied the idea - like they copi=
ed a lot of things. :) But this list  isn't the place to get further into t=
his topic, though it's interesting.
