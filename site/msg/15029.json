The only thing that seperates them is freq=\r\nuency and power. Radio waves are radio waves because they occupy a certain =\r\nblock of the electromagnietic spectrum. Sound waves exist on that same spec=\r\ntrum just farther down with much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic wave=\r\ns can penetrate almost anything because of their wavelengths. The shorter t=\r\nhe wavelength the more ways we can shield against them.\n\n                  =\r\n      Think of microwaves. These are also a type of radio and telemetry tra=\r\nnsmitting wave but the waves also have a physical effect on our environment=\r\n by causing molecules to speed up, which creates heat. A little lower than =\r\nthis is IR or infrared it too can cause physical objects to heat up but usu=\r\nally it just causes molecules to rotate in place. All physical things give =\r\noff IR light. Its a way the total system conserves energy by spontaneously =\r\nemitting IR radiation.\n\n                        Frank R.\n\n                 =\r\n       --- On Mon, 6/8/09, April Abercrombie &lt;april@abercrombiegh ostresear=\r\nch. com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n                          From: April Abercrombie &lt;april@=\r\nabercrombiegh ostresearch. com&gt;\n                          Subject: Re: [EVP=\r\n-ITC] New ideas [3 Attachments]\n                          To: EVP-ITC@yahoo=\r\ngroups .com\n                          Date: Monday, June 8, 2009, 2:27 PM\n\n=\r\n\n                          Here is some food for thought. I am currently re=\r\nviewing my audio from our May 30th investigation.\n\n                        =\r\n  It was me and another girl teammate present in the room. I picked up a 3r=\r\nd female voice on my digital voice recorder that I carry with me. We were s=\r\ntanding right next to another digital video recorder that I leave beside my=\r\n night vision camera. That recorder did not pick up this 3rd voice. I have =\r\nasked the girl that was with me to check her recording to see if she picked=\r\n it up.\n\n                          I have long felt the true EVP does not c=\r\nome from sound waves in the environment, or then it wouldn&#39;t be EVP, but a =\r\ndisembodied voice. Somehow EVP&#39;s are appearing directly on the recordings.\n=\r\n\n                          This instance with the recorders may back that t=\r\nheory up. That other recorder should have picked that voice up if it were s=\r\nound waves in the environment.\n\n                          I am attaching th=\r\ne clip of this 3rd voice. The file that is named &quot;01-02-17 Clip&quot; is the ful=\r\nl clip. You will hear my voice as I say &quot;Yeah&quot;, and then another comes in r=\r\night after that. I think I know what it says.\n\n                          Ag=\r\nain, I was live monitoring my audio, but still did not hear this until play=\r\nback.

It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultra=\r\nsonic waves that differ one another in frequency then if you add or subtrac=\r\nt them together you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For exampl=\r\ne, if a ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in =\r\na room creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a inter=\r\nmediate difference frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz=\r\n to 20KHz). This was just an example, but all electronic equipment generate=\r\ns ultrasonic signals just by turning them on.

It works off the \n          =\r\n                      heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic \n    =\r\n                            waves that differ one another in frequency then=\r\n \n                                if you add or subtract them together you =\r\nget a \n                                beat frequency or alternate frequenc=\r\ny. For \n                                example, if a ghost is sending a si=\r\ngnal at 54KHz \n                                and you have an electric fan=\r\n in a room creating \n                                an untrasonic frequenc=\r\ny at 45KHz then you will \n                                have a intermedia=\r\nte difference&nbsp;frequency at \n                                9KHz, well=\r\n within human hearing range (20Hz to \n                                20KHz=\r\n).
