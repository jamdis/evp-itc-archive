<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I see these sites with Hollywood images of demons and ghosts, and it makes 
me affraid that&#x27;s what the expectation is. To be frightened, or seek the 
sensational.


I had other comments, but I doubt if it would come accross as anything but 
being negative, so I deleted that.  Suffice to say I still have doubts,  if 
no one else can use my boxes and get anything that resembles in the 
slightest what I get, I can&#x27;t tell if the boxes work, and if few can hear 
the voices that I get, hearing instead broadcast fragments, I have to 
question my own perception. Even after seven years, I don&#x27;t know what to 
make of this. Yes, there&#x27;s something communicating in EVP, no, I don&#x27;t know 
what &quot;it&quot; is, and no I don&#x27;t think I have a good system yet.
