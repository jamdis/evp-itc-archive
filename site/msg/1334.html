<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, welcome from me, too!

I would add that a top Web site to check out is the American 
Association for Electronic Voice Phenomena...http://www.aaevp.com/.

At the miniumum - click on the &quot;Techniques&quot; button and read through 
them.

Bill and I are both members so we get BIG kickbacks for everyone who 
signs up! LOL... Naw...we WISH!!!

&gt; Hey Jessie, welcome to the forum. There are lot&#x27;s of web based 
&gt; resources with different suggestions on recording evp&#x27;s but the #1 
bit 
&gt; of advice is to make certain other people nearby are speaking. The 
mic 
&gt; can be more sensitive than your ears and the recording is 
amplified so 
&gt; contaminated evidence is always a concern. If you&#x27;re recording 
with 
&gt; other folks make sure no one whispers, if they do announce out 
loud 
&gt; ythe name of the person and announce that they whispered. EVP&#x27;s 
often 
&gt; sound like a whisper and usually have a different accoustic 
quality, 
&gt; ex: the room noise or echo sounds different.
&gt; 
&gt; If you don&#x27;t have audio editing software check out &quot;Audacity&quot;. 
Just 
&gt; Google it, it&#x27;s a free download. You&#x27;ll want to transfer your 
files to 
&gt; a computer and sometimes filter out hum but be careful not to over 
&gt; filter. You can also cut down long recordings into reasonable 
sizes. 
&gt; 
&gt; Although, people have recorded EVP&#x27;s in many different places, try 
&gt; locations that you can connect with emotionally. This facilitates 
a 
&gt; possible psychic connection which some people theorize helps get 
&gt; successful recordings.
&gt; 
&gt; We&#x27;ll be listening , Bill

&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am from Northern Michigan, and am interested in capturing 
EVPS. I
&gt; &gt; have a digital recorder in which I have gotten a few my first 
try. But
&gt; &gt; I would like to see what others say as far as ways to get the 
best
&gt; &gt; results. So I am pretty new to this, but excited to try some
&gt; &gt; experiments. Thanks, Jessie
