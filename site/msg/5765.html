<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>No, not really.  If i had to take a guess, i would say it is the fact 
that other spirit entities sometimes can&#x27;t get past the grounded ones 
in my home.  The grounded spirits seem to be more dominant and block 
the others out at times coming through the box.  That always bugged 
me because the grounded spirits only block others, they never speak 
with me.  I would like to find out who is here and why, but they 
never answer me.

&gt; &gt; I did my first session in a week and got a couple good files, 
please 
&gt; &gt; listen if you get a chance.  Also, has anybody ever though of 
&gt; recording 
&gt; &gt; an EVP Maker session in MP3 format and play it back later plugged 
&gt; into 
&gt; &gt; speakers through an MP3 player while asking questions.  I had 
&gt; attempted 
&gt; &gt; it about a year ago with minimal success.  I think they need the 
live 
&gt; &gt; stream, but if anybody is willing to test it out i would love to 
hear 
&gt; &gt; the results.
