It makes s=\r\nense to me.\n\nI have gotten several EVP recordings in which a name was given=\r\n. In all cases the name is not a name that was known by any of the living p=\r\neople present and there is no particular reason for anyone there to be thin=\r\nking of that name. In one case the name was verified in old=C2=A0records=C2=\r\n=A0as a person present in that location many years ago (but we certainly di=\r\ndn&#39;t know that at the time we were there). In another case we&#39;re still=C2=\r\n=A0trying to find out if anyone by that name was in that area within the la=\r\nst 150 years.\n\nZack\n\n=C2=A0\nOn Fri, Jun 11, 2010 at 1:59 PM, John S &lt;phenom=\r\n_investigator @...&gt; wrote:\n\n=C2=A0 \n&gt;I was listening to Tom&#39;s very cl=\r\near recording and decided to put it through Audacity\n&gt;so I could view the s=\r\npectrum. Usually recordings have far too much noise for this\n&gt;to work well,=\r\n which is why I like the clearer and cleaner recordings many people\n&gt;call &#39;=\r\nClass A&#39;.=C2=A0 What I found got me to thinking and I want to=C2=A0share my=\r\n thoughts.\n&gt;\n&gt;First, it&#39;s helpful to know that I have quite a bit of profes=\r\nsional experience studying\n&gt;spectra - from ULF up through sound and light a=\r\nnd way into the region of radio\n&gt;waves and even cosmic radiation. I have st=\r\nared at more spectrum analyzers over\n&gt;the decades than I care to count. So =\r\nwhen I realized what I was seeing in Tom&#39;s\n&gt;recording I was a bit surprised=\r\n I hadn&#39;t thought about it before.\n&gt;\n&gt;Usually when you look at a visual rep=\r\nresentation of an audio recording, you can\n&gt;clearly see the noise with the =\r\nsignal superimposed atop it. The higher the noise\n&gt;level relative to the si=\r\ngnal level, the lower the &#39;signal-to-noise&#39; ratio which results\n&gt;in recordi=\r\nngs that are very hard to hear. In a normal recording, such as you might \n&gt;=\r\nmake of yourself speaking into a microphone, there is a specific way the no=\r\nise\n&gt;band disappears when the signal level gets high enough. But more than =\r\nthat, \n&gt;this only occurs when the signal is introduced in the early stages =\r\nof audio \n&gt;processing - a noisy amplifier for example looks completely diff=\r\nerent than \n&gt;a high level background noise with someone speaking over it. A=\r\nnd that&#39;s \n&gt;what is important here.\n&gt;\n&gt;What I noticed that got me thinking =\r\nwas that in the spectrum analysis, \n&gt;the noise level was reasonable for thi=\r\ns type of recording. And it was fairly\n&gt;constant. It was what I have come t=\r\no see in these recordings except that\n&gt;the signal to noise ratio was a bit =\r\nbetter. Meaning the signal was a bit \n&gt;clearer initially. When the sound (w=\r\nhich seems to be a young girl&#39;s\n&gt;voice) begins, the noise level rapidly goe=\r\ns down and almost completely\n&gt;vanishes while the signal goes high. This is =\r\nwhy you can clearly hear\n&gt;the voice: the absence of noise as much as the si=\r\ngnal level itself.\n&gt;\n&gt;Now here&#39;s what got me going. I realized that this sp=\r\necific waveform\n&gt;suggests strongly that the point of influence is not deep =\r\ninside the \n&gt;electronics. Rather, it is at an exterior point, such as where=\r\n the signal\n&gt;first enters the system. And that would imply that something t=\r\nowards\n&gt;the outer part of the electronics is being manipulated, and not the=\r\n \n&gt;recording media or anything near it. \n&gt;\n&gt;This would also explain why voi=\r\nce phenomena can appear on different\n&gt;media and on different electronics su=\r\nch as transistor or solid state or\n&gt;vacuum tube. AAEVP has suggested, and b=\r\nased on this observation\n&gt;I would agree, that the probable point of influen=\r\nce is a junction near \n&gt;the a front-end stage of an early amplifier circuit=\r\n. Every electronic \n&gt;system would have this in common.\n&gt;\n&gt;I have suggested =\r\nbefore that I believe that at least some (probably \n&gt;the higher quality) EV=\r\nPs may be due to operator PK influence.\n&gt;MicroPK is believed to operate at =\r\nor near the molecular level as \n&gt;evidenced by things such as healing. And h=\r\nealing agents have\n&gt;been identified who have many similar traits to PK agen=\r\nts. So\n&gt;it follows they may employ similar abilities and use similar \n&gt;mech=\r\nanisms.=C2=A0 This observation is entirely in line with this idea.\n&gt;\n&gt;Does =\r\nthis mean that in truth no discarnates are communicating?\n&gt;In a dramatic de=\r\nmonstration of who I really am, or more to the \n&gt;point what I really believ=\r\ne, let me say that I&#39;m not yet sure.\n&gt;Maybe they are, and maybe they are no=\r\nt. This evidence does\n&gt;not tell us that answer.\n&gt;\n&gt;This is similar to work =\r\nin mediumship research. We have shown\n&gt;that mediums can receive information=\r\n they should not know in\n&gt;controlled laboratory conditions. But we don&#39;t kn=\r\now scientifically\n&gt;where this information comes from. Apparitional experien=\r\nts are\n&gt;convinced they have seen or heard the dead, but apparitions of \n&gt;th=\r\ne living are quite common as well. The more you learn about\n&gt;this phenomena=\r\n, the more you realize that many commoly \n&gt;accepted=C2=A0explanation s fall=\r\n short when applied in general.\n&gt;\n&gt;As I wrote previously, the real issue is=\r\n that science today\n&gt;does=C2=A0 not have the understanding or the tools to =\r\nproperly \n&gt;evaluate this data. Science cannot prove or disprove this \n&gt;phen=\r\nomena. Not today. An honest scientist (and skeptic)\n&gt;will tell you this is =\r\nan unknown, an anomaly. And so, as\n&gt;folks here know, it comes down to belie=\r\nf in the absence \n&gt;of any protocol or experiment to clearly demonstrate the=\r\n\n&gt;source of these sounds.\n&gt;\n&gt;But I for one feel comfortable that higher qua=\r\nlity recordings\n&gt;will help move us along, if for no other reason than we ca=\r\nn \n&gt;eliminate some variables. The analysis I mentioned can&#39;t \n&gt;be done on n=\r\noisier recordings; it took a very quiet one to\n&gt;be able to see this clearly=\r\n. And that&#39;s what triggered my \n&gt;thoughts.\n&gt;\n&gt;I also noticed a tiny spike b=\r\nefore and after the higher\n&gt;quality speech. To some this might suggest an e=\r\ndit, \n&gt;but in this case I don&#39;t think that happened - here&#39;s why.\n&gt;You can =\r\nsee the signal emerging from the noise when\n&gt;noise is still present and onl=\r\ny when it achieves a certain\n&gt;level is the noise suppressed. Had this been =\r\nan edit, \n&gt;the noise level on this close a scrutiny would have \n&gt;been a bit=\r\n more obvious - unless the editor got very lucky.\n&gt;But in consideration of =\r\nhow the voice appears and \n&gt;also the fact that similar low-level spikes app=\r\near \n&gt;elsewhere in the recording, it would seem more likely\n&gt;that the spike=\r\ns are artifacts of the tuning that&#39;s going\n&gt;on or some other random events.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Once again, this makes the case for me at least \n&gt;for trying to get the=\r\n highest quality possible. These\n&gt;are the kinds of=C2=A0recordings which sc=\r\nientists may be \n&gt;able to use sooner than later as understanding and \n&gt;tool=\r\ns inevitably improve.\n&gt;\n&gt;One last thought regarding the notion of PK as an =\r\n\n&gt;explanation. It is very important we come to understand\n&gt;PK well. Only th=\r\nen might it actually be used in a \n&gt;practical way. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard or=\r\n thought about\n&gt;a world where you could literally turn things on and off\n&gt;w=\r\nith your mind. Or type simply by thinking about it.\n&gt;Believe it or not, one=\r\n way forward to such technology\n&gt;could well be through the understanding of=\r\n PK. So much\n&gt;of Parapsychology is actually exploring the leading edge\n&gt;(so=\r\nme might say &#39;bleeding&#39; edge) of science. It shows us\n&gt;where things might g=\r\no and, frankly, that is one interesting\n&gt;world at least for me. That&#39;s why =\r\nI have been in the field\n&gt;for many decades.\n&gt;\n&gt;Apologies for the long post,=\r\n but I thought some might \n&gt;find it useful and informative.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-1909640931-1276285707=:31600\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;=\r\nfont-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D4&gt;John S I just recently star=\r\nted a sister group where all we do is record with Jesus&nbsp;to get message=\r\ns.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D4&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D4=\r\n&gt;Perhaps one of us, Bruce, Steve or Frank or I would even volunteer, should=\r\n set up a sister group where all members do is record with the dead to find=\r\n out how they get their messags to show up in the radio noise where our rec=\r\norders pick it up.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D4&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D4&gt;All recorded information can be used in our research to bu=\r\nild a better device.

To some this might suggest=\r\n an edit, &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;but in this case I don&#39;t think that happened - here&#39;s=\r\n why.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;You can see the signal emerging from the noise when&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;noise is still present and only when it achieves a certain&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\nlevel is the noise suppressed. Had this been an edit, &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;the noise=\r\n level on this close a scrutiny would have &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;been a bit more obvi=\r\nous - unless the editor got very lucky.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;But in consideration of =\r\nhow the voice appears and &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;also the fact that similar low-level =\r\nspikes appear &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;elsewhere in the recording, it would seem more li=\r\nkely&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;that the spikes are artifacts of the tuning that&#39;s going&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;on or some other random events.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Once =\r\nagain, this makes the case for me at least &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;for trying to get th=\r\ne highest quality possible. These&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;are the kinds of&nbsp;recordin=\r\ngs which scientists may be &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;able to use sooner than later as und=\r\nerstanding and &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;tools inevitably improve.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;One last thought regarding the notion of PK as an &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;explan=\r\nation. It is very important we come to understand&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;PK well. Only =\r\nthen might it actually be used in a &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;practical way. I&#39;m sure you=\r\n&#39;ve heard or thought about&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;a world where you could literally tur=\r\nn things on and off&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;with your mind. Or type simply by thinking a=\r\nbout it.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Believe it or not, one way forward to such technology&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;could well be through the understanding of PK. So much&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;of Parapsychology is actually exploring the leading edge&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;(some =\r\nmight say &#39;bleeding&#39; edge) of science. It shows us&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;where things =\r\nmight go and, frankly, that is one interesting&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;world at least fo=\r\nr me. That&#39;s why I have been in the field&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;for many decades.&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Apologies for the long post, but I thought some mi=\r\nght &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;find it useful and informative.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/B=\r\nLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;META content=3Don http-equiv=3Dx-dns-prefetch-c=\r\nontrol&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-1909640931-1276285707=:31600--"}
