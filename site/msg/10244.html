<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi, Misty.  

I am deleting some of my files, but is there a file size that is 
appropriate?  Though I posted audio in .wav files, they actually seem 
pretty small in file size.  I do not have time to convert these and 
wonder if they are OK the way they are?  

Please advise...  :)

&gt; Hello all. It&#x27;s that time again for me to remind you that the group 
&gt; is low on space (96% used) and actions will be taken. For now 
rather 
&gt; than delete everyones files I am asking that you convert your wav 
&gt; format into mp3 or smaller format before you post them to the files 
&gt; area.
&gt; 
&gt; One member using 10+ megs out of our groups 100 total megs just 
isnt 
&gt; going to fly anymore. So starting in May all files that are not 
&gt; within size limits and arent in smallest formats will have to start 
&gt; to get deleted.
&gt; 
&gt; For those who cant convert your files I have programs that are free 
&gt; to help you do that. For those that dont want to convert your 
files, 
&gt; you can use esnips to post your larger files and share them with 
the 
&gt; group as links in posts. For those that ignore my posts and do what 
&gt; you want to anyway, your stuff will be deleted and your option to 
&gt; upload and share here in group will be disabled.
&gt; 
&gt; As I said we have 100 (one hundred) megs total in file section for 
&gt; sharing, please do not abuse your share of that space. As you can 
see 
&gt; there are others who like to share too. Eventually we may just 
clean 
&gt; it out of everyones files but for now lets try and stick to 
&gt; compacting the things we upload and make use of places like esnips 
&gt; for sharing.
&gt;
