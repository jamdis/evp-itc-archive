I will say it&#39;s a challenge to hea=\r\nr exactly what you have transcribed for every file. However, I do hear some=\r\n of it. Since I don&#39;t have such an instrument and certainly not a lot of te=\r\nch experience, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re right that I&#39;m tuning my ear to hear the usu=\r\nal EVPs recorded with digital recorders, etc. I am curious whether, with pr=\r\nactice, my hearing will become more attuned to pick out chains of words, ph=\r\nrases as you have been able to do. Right now, I&#39;ll just hear one word or tw=\r\no out of a clip that might have five words, for example. One thing I&#39;m curi=\r\nous to know is whether any type of sound transmitted can be considered &#39;up =\r\nfor grabs,&#39; so to say, as being an EVP? For example, in some of the EVPs I&#39;=\r\nve heard on here as well as ones that Christopher Moon played on his Coast =\r\nto Coast show back in March, some sounded like snippets of a song even. Thi=\r\ns\n leads me to think that we who are untrained could be missing quite a bit=\r\n since it could not be the sounds we are expecting.\n\nThen again, you may ju=\r\nst have an innate sense/talent for this! I do appreciate you sharing these =\r\nand I read every email!\n\nTake care,\nLisa\n\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom=\r\n: Frank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt;\nTo: evp-itc@yahoogroups.com\nSen=\r\nt: Wednesday, October 24, 2007 3:57:03 PM\nSubject: [EVP-ITC] The voices\n\n\nI=\r\n think many join this group expecting the old type EVP voices, like ghost h=\r\nunters get.
