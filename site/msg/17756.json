How big are the speaker and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; microphone on each side? Are they enclosed in a box with the tubes with one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; on each end and how are they positioned? Just trying to piece things\n&gt; &gt;&gt; together. :)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Dwayne\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
