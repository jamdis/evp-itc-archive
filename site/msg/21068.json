The purpose of the box is to get bits of speech, music and noise, call raw audio, that the entities use ot make their voices out of. Some do not want this process to work. so they come out with these idiotic ways to defeat the box, and it works, since most in America have zero technical knowledge. Covering the box with fol is a scam, a con, a trick, and fucking dumbass idea. \n\n If ya want white noise voices, why even have the box!?\n\n but some expert said it, so it must be true, to hell with what I have to say!\n\nF-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ursula Kalin &lt;kalinu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; so you can wrap the radio in foil itself..i thought you needed a box (shoe box etc)..I have to try that..it acts as a nature filter right...I like to stand away from it it helps as well not to be right on it\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 3/9/11, Urkel23 &lt;urkel23@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Urkel23 &lt;urkel23@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: And what the heck is it?

AM wide pulls in a lot of radio, but AM regular mode only pulls in a few.
