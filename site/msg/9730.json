THAT&#39;S ALL.\n\nI know what the first son probably refers to.. and I have heard of\nShiva but never &#39;Shiva Justice&#39;.. so I looked that up and this is what\nI found in reference to the definition of Shiva Justice:\n\nfrom: http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Siva_Shiva/id/137936\n\nSiva, Shiva (Sanskrit) The third god of the Hindu Trimurti (trinity):\nBrahma the evolver; Vishnu the preserver; and Siva the regenerator or\ndestroyer.\n\nSiva is one of the three loftiest divinities of our solar system, and\nin his character of destroyer stands higher than Vishnu for he is &quot;the\ndestroying deity, evolution and PROGRESS personified, who is the\nregenerator at the same time; who destroys things under one form but\nto recall them to life under another more perfect type&quot; (SD 2:182). \n\nAs the destroyer of outward forms he is called Vamadeva. Endowed with so\nmany powers and attributes, Siva possesses a great number of names,\nand is represented under a corresponding variety of forms. He\ncorresponds to the Palestinian Ba`al or Moloch, Saturn, the Phoenician\nEl, the Egyptian Seth, and the Biblical Chiun of Amos, and Greek Typhon.\n\nSiva is known under more than a thousand names or titles and is\nrepresented under many different forms in Hindu writings. As the god\nof generation and of justice, he is represented riding a white bull;\nhis own color, as well as that of the bull, is generally white,\nreferring probably to the unsullied purity of abstract justice. He is\nsometimes seen with two hands, sometimes with four, eight, or ten; and\nwith five faces, representing among other things his power over the\nfive elements.\n\n&quot;In the Rig Veda the name Siva is unknown, but the god is called\nRudra, which is a word used for Agni, the fire god . . .&quot;; &quot;In the\nVedas he is the divine Ego aspiring to return to its pure, deific\nstate, and at the same time that divine ego imprisoned in earthly\nform, whose fierce passions make of him the &#39;roarer,&#39; the &#39;terrible&#39; &quot;\n(SD 2:613, 548).\n\nSiva is often spoken of as the patron deity of esotericists,\noccultists, and ascetics; he is called the Mahayogin (the great\nascetic), from whom the highest spiritual knowledge is acquired, and\nunion with the great spirit of the universe is eventually gained. Here\nhe is &quot;the howling and terrific destroyer of human passions and\nphysical senses, which are ever in the way of the development of the\nhigher spiritual perceptions and the growth of the inner eternal man\n-- mystically . . . Siva-Rudra is the Destroyer, as Vishnu is the\npreserver; and both are the regenerators of spiritual as well as of\nphysical nature. To live as a plant, the seed must die. To live as a\nconscious entity in the Eternity, the passions and senses of man must\nfirst die before his body does. &#39;To live is to die and to die is to\nlive,&#39; has been too little understood in the West. Siva, the\ndestroyer, is the creator and the Saviour of Spiritual man, as he is\nthe good gardener of nature. He weeds out the plants, human and\ncosmic, and kills the passions of the physical, to call to life the\nperceptions of the spiritual, man&quot; (SD 1:459&n).\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n                           \n\n\nMichael Edwards:  f1cracker75@...\n        \r\n--0-1397230594-1208220139=:57087\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\nI googled shiva justice.
