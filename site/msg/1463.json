He mentioned that when he first \n&gt;got his box it called Franks name repeatedly. That isnt the first time I \n&gt;saw someone say that. I know quite a few of you now have been given a box \n&gt;or even constructed your own versions like Steve based on the work Frank \n&gt;did.\n&gt;\n&gt;   I have heard a couple of peoples results here but I would like to hear \n&gt;more so I am going to ask if you have one you comment on your use of it and \n&gt;how you think the results went as well as maybe post a few sound files that \n&gt;I can hear. I have spent years listening to the box voices but its \n&gt;refreshing to hear others results and see the variations as with any other \n&gt;evp method, it differs by user/location. LOL you know who you are and I \n&gt;wont name you all but I do hope you will share with us.\n&gt;\n&gt;   Thanks!\n&gt;   Misty\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------\n&gt;Be a better Heartthrob.
