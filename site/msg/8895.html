Yeah, i went back and listened and caught the end of that file.  But 
like you said, it is a bit rough to catch.  Yeah, i want to believe 
that they are dead too but i can&#x27;t be sure of that.  We may never 
know who is speaking through these devices, all i know is that they 
are and it fascinates me.  We need clearer communication to get the 
whole story, i think we have made great progress here though.  I am 
light years ahead of where i was this time last year, so it is 
getting better all the time.  All we can do is stay dedicated to this 
and hopefully there will be a breakthrough someday.

&gt; I heard all of those as you did.. but I read Margaret&#x27;s response to 
your
&gt; files and I agree that I hear Mother Fkr at the end of the Adios 
clip.  It&#x27;s
&gt; rough but there.
&gt; 
&gt; And I have no clue who these spirits are.  My gut tells me they are 
people
&gt; who have died.. but I can&#x27;t say if my gut is right or not.  I 
noticed they
&gt; don&#x27;t like to talk about themselves.  Why the big secret?  To me 
that is the
&gt; bigger mystery.

&gt; Couple pretty good files in here, sorry for the cursing file. That 
&gt; makes this more real to me and they know that. I don&#x27;t believe they 
&gt; curse because they don&#x27;t like me, i think they know i post the 
audio 
&gt; for others to hear and want to prove their existence. I also got 
&gt; the &quot;Are We Dead?&quot; file. That maybe the first clear message that&#x27;s 
&gt; relevant to what we are doing, it must be grounded spirits asking 
&gt; that. If anyone has any thoughts of who would say that, it may be 
&gt; another discussion. Maybe it&#x27;s not grounded spirits, but whom than?
