I post in wav. format I believe when you convert the file from wav to mp3.=

certain aspects of the file are lost. If an mp3. file is a tenth of the si=
ze of
a wav. file where does the other 9/10's go.
 
If it is compressed the=
n it definitely loses quality. 
I think every nuance in a box file is cruci=
al for the 
correct interpretation of the file, sometimes the a word create=
d by the entity is not only
comprised of radio fragment but also static noi=
se mixed with the fragments of radio vocal
to form the message the entity w=
ishes to leave. I don't know the technical aspects of the file 
change but =
I think it's common sense that when you try to pour a gallon of water into =
a shot glass
all you wind up with is a shot glass full of water the rest is=
 spilled and lost.
 
I keep my files posted for 5 or less days, just long e=
nough for anyone that wants to listen can.
If your going to leave your file=
s posted indefinitely and keep adding to the folder then of course it will
=
put pressure on the storage space.
 
As far as posting a notice for every f=
ile, some of us may wish to listen from their e-mail or not 
have to go to =
the file section to listen, That's probably why that option is given.
If I =
didn't like the notices cluttering up my e-mail in box you can change that =
feature in the group
membership options. So if anyone does not want that fe=
ature they can turn it off and only read posts on the group.
 
It's not the=
 lack of space is the mismanagement of it by all of us. 
when I change my f=
iles from wav. to mp3 I hear a distinct difference, do it in an audio edito=
r and you can visually see the difference.

Misty,I have and idea. One solution is to p=
ost Mp3 files instead of Wav. files or any other format. It seems like the =
Mp3's sound the same and are only 1/10th of the size. I think that would pr=
obably clear up 90 percent of the board right there. If i actually have mor=
e than a couple files from here on out, i will be attaching them to an e-ma=
il and not the board to save space here. And also, if people do post files =
maybe we can all just have one post that says we have uploaded files to our=
 folder instead of 30 audio announcements in a row that just seems to waste=
 a lot of e-mail space in the individual e-mails. And it also pushes the cu=
rrent topic on the board to another page and is lost for those who wanted t=
o share. Just my thoughts on helping the subject. I know we are all excited=
, but misty is right. I went to add a file the other day and the group was =
at 93 percent capacity, so it won't be long before we run out of space.-Ste=
