I still hear them as I did a couple weeks ago. Not &quot;standard&quot; (whatever that is) EVP, but why should it be ignored, unless of course I&#39;m imagining what I heard. \n&gt; \n&gt;  I think the reason for this kind of stuff is multi level. First, it shows EVP/box voices are not the usual HW BS. Second, there&#39;s infinite levels that come through, some if it deceptive(yet teaches). Most important, I think it pokes fun at what we think we know is out there. \n&gt; \n&gt;  I sent these to one of the author/experts and as usual--no response--they seemingly know so much better. It just does not fit the haunting/ghost hunter paradigm--where the megabucks and fame is. \n&gt; \n&gt;  And yeah, I&#39;ve spent the last week moving, I&#39;m physically tired, and mentally have the usual case of torqued jaws. \n&gt; \n&gt;  F-S\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I know, not proper EVP, but ....Now I have cartoon spirits---LOL!
