You know like the K2 they used to &quot;supposedly&quot; (jury is still out) talk to ghosts but cheaper.\n\nWell as an EMF sensor, I expected a number of things to set it off.  2 things:\n\n1) Hardly anything did set it off.  I was amazed by this.  I had to set it directly on my laptop to even pick up the 60 hz from the fans.  This surprised me.  I had expected it to go nuts with all the wireless this and wireless that, TVs, TIVOs and laptop.  Anyway I thought it was interesting the level of shielding these days.\n\n2) and my real point.  We had a big thunder storm come through last night.  I turned it on expecting it to go off when nearby lightning strikes hit.  The amazing thing was that it would go off when there was no lightning and no thunder.  But some really close strikes did nothing but barely move the needle.\n\nI&#39;m not exactly looking for answers but I was surprised about the storm.  Next storm I&#39;ll have to see if it goes off a little before a big strike.  It seemed like minutes to me between them but I was not paying that much attention.\n\nSo, sorry for the off-topic but I did warn you ahead of time so you could just delete.\n\nBTW if anyone has any ideas on that part 2, I&#39;d love to hear it but it probably needs to be direct email instead of to the list.\n\nDon\n \n    \r\n--0-1318295991-1226461383=:67504\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Old school ghost theory ( 1970s) was that high humidity helped you to see them.&nbsp; Something &lt;br&gt;about conductivity but 38 years ago....
