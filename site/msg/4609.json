I haven&#39;t been too active in the realm of EVP recording \nrecently, but have had what I consider excellent results in the past \nusing my little refurbished Ebay-bargain Olympus VN-120 PC.\n\nI&#39;m anxious to start recording again and am feeling pretty \noverwhelmed by the technology you all seem to be using.  I know a \nlittle about using good headphones and denoiser programs, but beyond \nthat I&#39;m electronically challenged.  Still, I wonder if there are \nsimple techniques I can experiment with to increase my success.  I \nthink I&#39;m a little bored.\n\nI&#39;ve felt pretty strongly that I&#39;ve been communicating with a very \nsmall number of entities, and I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s due to the \nlimitations of my equipment. My most impressive EVPs have always been \ncaptured around my own home, particularly outside on the hill and \nnear the barn.  I&#39;ve gotten two inside my house (after inviting \nspirits in), and probably 75% in total have been negative messages.  \n\nAnyway, I&#39;m thinking about getting another DVR and would love to hear \nyour thoughts and recommendations about which ones are best.  I would \nlike to communicate with more advanced entities eventually, but \nunfortunately don&#39;t have the brain for building anything myself.\n\nThanks!\n\nRobin"}
