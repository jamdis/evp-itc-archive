<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The seismic event (if that&#x27;s what it was) was measured by people 
monitoring the Schumann resonances of the earth on ELF (extremely low 
frequencies). It was noted by several people along the west coast of the 
USA but not in some other locations. Schumann resonance phenomena usually 
occur along with earthquakes or other seismic events, but they could be 
caused by other things, too.

It&#x27;s been hypothesized it was either a large meteor entering earth&#x27;s 
atmosphere and possibly striking earth somewhere, a nuclear explosion or a 
solar flare event.

There was a solar flare within the last couple days but the resultant 
effects here did not happen at the times the Schumann perturbations were 
noticed.  Another idea has been brought up - the recent Chilean volcano 
eruptions.

Maybe we&#x27;ll never know for sure ... it must not have been anything 
catastrophic.

&gt; Have there been any ITC messages about this??
