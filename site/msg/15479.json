They were asking for you, this was a few days \n&gt; ago, over my  radio the RS 20-125 they sound very clear to me, didn&#39;t say \n&gt; what they  wanted maybe I can go through the recording, and see what else \nthey \n&gt;  are saying. They like to watch baseball sometimes on my big screen, had \na  \n&gt; whole group of them here last weekend, for fun I asked them where  they \nwere \n&gt; in the house, they said &quot;all around&quot; and &quot;4 are sitting on  the floor,&quot; I \n&gt; said, well I must walk right through you people then,  they said &quot;yes&quot; I \n&gt; asked them if they felt any sensation, they said  they do feel when we \nwalk \n&gt; through them. I always ask them if they  want football or baseball, they \nsay \n&gt; &quot;baseball&quot; I had one spirit fella  here routing for Seattle, it was the \n&gt; Tigers _Mariners game, since I&#39;m  not much into sports, I wasn&#39;t really \nsure if \n&gt; it was a rerun or not,  but they seemed to be happy, when I went into my \n&gt; room to work, I  could hear them in the front room chatting amongst \n&gt; themselves.  Sometimes it&#39;s neat to have company out here, and I don&#39;t \neven have to  \n&gt; feed them. Would you know anything about who the fella is in the  second \n&gt; one?
