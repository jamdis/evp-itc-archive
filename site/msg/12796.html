<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>hummmm -and yet somehow I seem to be the only friggihn&#x27; duffus out 
here that can understand spirit communication  enough to make the 
shit that works! And, that no one seems able to duplicate, depite 
that fact that the concepts and circuits are simple.

&gt; I am a bit taken back, Frank...spiritualism teaches pretty much 
the same thing (about setting your own self imposed laws and rules, 
etc). 
&gt; Natural Law in the spiritualist movement is about not only Natural 
Laws (such as gravity) and combining with spirit philosophy. One of 
their main teachings is that Natural Law can&#x27;t be broken. Gravity as 
such, can&#x27;t instantly become anti-gravity. Gives some constancy to 
our lives.

&gt; No hostility meant! Al, why do you think we are limited to this 
time/space universe? Even Hawking refers to the cosmos as a 
multiverse. When consciousness is involved, the only limits are the 
ones you press upon yourself. The only boundaries are the ones you 
build. We are so quick to give things meaning and definition but 
what do we truly know about existence. At one time philosophy and 
science were one until it was deemed we needed a more structured and 
disciplined approach to &quot;figuring things out&quot;, hence the birth of 
the scientific method.  Natural law is what we all agree it is!

&gt; I have a question that everyone might disagree with...perhaps not. 
Where does this leave Natural Law? 
&gt; You are right, Zack...because we are limited to this time/space 
universe. On the other hand, spirits (however you wish to refer to 
the deceased) are definetly not limited to this single universe as 
the living are. They become (I believe) non-localized entities. The 
living are localized... to the here and now. 
&gt; These are just some thoughts to share...not meant to cause any 
hostility, etc. 
&gt; Kimberly,
&gt; What do you think abhout non-localized entities?

&gt; &lt;&lt;But we are definitely dealing with the non-physical here, so any 
ideas 
&gt; that try to correlate a spirit to something physical can be thrown 
out the 
&gt; window. While it is true that they appear to be coexisting in the 
physical 
&gt; universe, there&#x27;s no reason to assume they are limited by it.&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I have dozens of EVP I&#x27;ve gotten in the former Manteno State 
Mental 
&gt; Hospital in Illinois. And you know what? Whatever made those EVP&#x27;s 
still 
&gt; seems to be crazy. And these were apparently made by spirits who 
no longer have physical bodies. So much for the idea of &quot;chemical 
imbalances in the brain&quot; being the root of insanity! A ghost doesn&#x27;t 
have a brain.
&gt; 
&gt; I think Hamlet summed it up the best:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are 
dreamt of in 
&gt; your philosophy.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I constantly remind myself of that.

Anyway, applying earth&#x27;s physical sciences to attempt to explain a 
phenomenon that has shown no evidence of roots in the physical is an 
exercise in futility and pointless.
