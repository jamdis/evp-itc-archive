&gt; Frank,
&gt;
&gt; I listened closely to the clips and I found only one to contain continuous
&gt; conversation between voices. I am continually amazed that you receive
&gt; multiple voices in conversation. It never seems to be just one person
&gt; speaking in your clips (from the ones I&#x27;ve heard anyway).
&gt;
&gt; There are typically two or more voices in conversation with one another,
&gt; which, as you know, should not be possible because of the rapid switching of
&gt; frequencies. But yet, these voices carry over all the switching. That should
&gt; be proof enough for people.
&gt;
&gt; By any chance do you know the amount of time your box stays on one
&gt; frequency before switching? Is this time different between random and sweep?
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, to my ears, the best clip of these was the one labeled 0609101820.
&gt; The voices in this clip were quite clear.
&gt;
&gt; @.01: Go Back (male)
&gt; @.02: It&#x27;s pretty cool (same male voice)
&gt; @.04: Awesome (female)
&gt; @.06: Hello (different female)
&gt; @.08: Help me (electronic)
&gt; @.09: Hi (same female as before)
&gt; @.10: Help me Help me (same electronic)
&gt; @.12: Help me (same electronic)
&gt; @.13: Help me (same electronic)
&gt; @.14: Help me (same electronic)
&gt;
&gt; Clip 0609102333 had few clear words to be analyzed:
&gt;
&gt; @.02: Hello (male)
&gt; @.03: Who has (?pulled center?) (female)
&gt; @.06: Whatever (same female)
&gt;
&gt; The 0609101257 clip (the one with the scope) was odd. There are vocal
&gt; characteristics present such as pitch and timbre, there are times when it
&gt; even sounds syllabled, but it does not sound like English to me. Could this
&gt; be one of your ET clips?
