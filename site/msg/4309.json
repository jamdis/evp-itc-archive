If he didn&#39;t post his 12-469 hack I would have never \nbecome curious about the 12-470, and figured out that hack.\nI remember asking the group, since the 12-470 looked similar, could \nit be hacked too?  Sum came back and said, &quot;$39.95 and you can find \nout, Mike&quot;.  So I went and paid the $39.95, opened it up... and the \nrest is history... :-)\n\nI think Sum is doing okay... I have a feeling we will be hearing from \nhim very soon..\n\n- Mike\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; LOL they look neat. Wonder where Sum went tho, it said he unjoined \nour group. Hope everything is well for him he deserves a big thanks \nfor coming up with the idea and getting you guys started. Hopefully \nwhen he can he will return.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Misty\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;M.A. Coletta (Mike)&quot; &lt;michaelcoletta@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           I&#39;ve just posted a couple of pictures in my album of the \nnew labels \n&gt; attached to my hacked Radio Shack 12-469&#39;s and 12-470. I think that \nis \n&gt; very appropriate... dont&#39;t you?\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                          \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Never miss a thing.
