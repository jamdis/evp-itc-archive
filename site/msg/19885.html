<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I wanted to try it again today with an actual session.  These files are from a short 5 minute recording.  They seem very conversational with this box.

Not much radio coming through, mostly fragments of speech making up the communication.  That&#x27;s how i like it anyway.  

I never use words from the radio, that is NOT communication in my opinion.  If you train your ear to listen a little differently, you will hear them talking using bits and pieces of sounds and not actual radio words.

My files are never crystal clear, but it is in my opinion an authentic way to present what we do.  Fragmented words seperated by a fast sweep that you can clearly hear, that&#x27;s how we will win against the skeptics.
