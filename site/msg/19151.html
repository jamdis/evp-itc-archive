<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was wondering if Frank - or anyone else in the group - has a Facebook page. I would like to be friends. I have made a hack a couple years ago and really enjoy using it. I have eventually picked up a &#x27;guide&#x27; with the box. I have had the opportunity to work with Rosemary Guiley and use the box that Frank had made for her. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the box. I have noticed also that while using the box, I pick up many evp over top of the frequencies. Has anyone else noticed this phenomena? Thanks for your time. If you would like to friend request or know Frank&#x27;s page should he have one, leave a note with your request. Thank you everybody.

Mick
