Think of your work as the (purple?) mother spawning this new wave of 
ITC experimentation.  Your improvements and ideas, though seeming to 
you as little, inspires others, having led to mass experimentation, 
currently birthing better communication, and increasing the amount of 
communicators and communications; all of this eventually sweeping the 
globe as a wave, IMHO.

Therefore, don&#x27;t put so much pressure on yourself.  Be patient, 
creative, have fun, etc, and allow the ideas to flow and develop.  
You should be at a comfortable place right now as the inventor, 
innovator, originator, and father of THE concept.  Let it go where it 
must go, and complement it as you feel led to do so.  

I perceive you have already made the most important contribution in 
all this, and that can never be taken away from you.  ;)

&gt;  Tuner with white noise running. There&#x27;s a little noise pick up, 
but I had the antenna wire runing very close to the RVG section.  
Afterward I replaced the antenna wire with coax to prevent noise pick 
up from inside the box. Oh yeah, manual tuing. 
&gt;  
&gt;  I know! There&#x27;s noisy crappy boxes out there, and I should have 
done this testing long ago, but so many wanted to be like Chris Moon, 
and I wanted to get the boxes out there so others could experience 
it, and experiment, but they function so poorly as yet, and no one 
gets anything close to what I do, or what Moon claims. So the TAPS 
article was correct about the things being flawed, but I&#x27;m working on 
it. I don&#x27;t sell the stuff, and never have, so all we&#x27;ve lost is 
time. I can&#x27;t make many of these, I can handle making them to test, 
and improve the thing, but I dread just having to wire and wire and 
build and build endlessly. I can&#x27;t do that stuff anymore, just too 
brain fried. 
&gt;  
&gt;  The fact is, there are other methods that work as well, and 
probably better. Often the voices are much clearer with the simple 
methods, and they can be shared since most can hear them. I am 
endlessly discouraged when I think I have a perfectly clear voice 
from the box, and not another person in the world can hear it.
