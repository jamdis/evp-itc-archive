Indeed!  A Pseudo EVP Researcher might also be considered "A Flake" right 
=
in there with the tin foil hat crowd.
Pseudo Skeptics and flakes are opposi=
te sides of the same coin.  One uses 
denial  of things that make him uncom=
fortable to ease his fears, the other 
embraces the "unknown" also for pers=
onal emotional comfort.  With both of 
these types you have a lack of infor=
mation and data.  The Pseudo skeptic 
does not have enough information abou=
t what paranormal studies is about, 
and the Flake will often be unaware of=
 or refuse to consider perfectly 
reasonable alternative explanations for w=
hat he finds.

Neither of these types are "real scientists".   I tend to ra=
g on the 
Pseudo skeptics though more than the "Flakes" and the "Quacks" (a=
 quack is 
a purposely dishonest fraud) as the pseudo skeptics seem to be m=
ore 
prevalent and less obviously the fools they are---having undue influen=
ce 
over the general public.

That's true, though the word for Pseudo-skept=
ic in your context is also 
"Cynic".  Which also brings to light the 'Pseud=
o-EVP-researcher'.  To 
re-quote your article switching the terms, it comes=
 out just as true:

... Indeed Skepticism is a vital part of scientific inv=
estigations, but 
it's Skepticism based on consideration of the facts and  =
expressing a 
caution or difference of opinion is what is useful in the Sci=
entific 
community.  A Pseudo-EVP-researcher is characterized by a person w=
ho 
clearly does not know the subject area other than through what may be 
=
termed "common knowledge" or, at best, a brief overview of the  tv.  A  
Ps=
eudo-EVP-researcher's "opinions" are based primarily on an emotional 
attit=
ude towards the subject matter rather than what few "facts" he knows. 
 Its=
 a psychological defense he uses to shore up his status, the validity 
of h=
is work, and to cope with things that frighten him. 

A real EVP-researcher=
 is a friend with a difference of opinion based on a 
genuine desire to hel=
p and sufficient data on the subject at hand to know 
what he/she is talkin=
g about.  We, as Scientists must always have a health 
dose of real Skeptic=
ism.  Otherwise we risk being the exact inverse of the 
cynic ---the "FLAKE=
".  The Flake is the type who will believe anything. 
Just as the cynic has=
 a need to reject things on emotional grounds, the 
Flake has a need to acc=
ept EVERYTHING on emotional grounds.  Any shadow, 
sound, or corner of the =
eye flash just HAS to be a ghost or spirit. ----or 
whatever.  I think you =
know the type, and   these "flakes" are what cynics 
accuse us who are seri=
ous about paranormal studies  of being.  Perhaps its 
one of the reasons th=

Re: [EVP-ITC] What the skepdicks r missing








 


I've=
 heard the same said for the evp researchers!  But it's not that 
simple in=
 either case:
the last block that you reference has small print that says "=
Compare the 
hypothesis to the experiment's conclusion".  Which of course y=
ou can't do 
unless you already visited the hypothesis block and have a hyp=
othesis to 
which to compare.  That in turn has small print which says "pre=
dict the 
outcome of the problem", which of course you can't do either unle=
ss you've 
already visited the earlier block of Purpose ("state the problem=
").

I don't think it's helpful to deny good evidence, whether it is good 
=
evidence from someone claiming to have detected spirits, or whether it is 
=
good evidence from someone claiming that people can mistake noise for 
spee=
ch or random radio tunings for spirit control.  That's why the 
scientific =
method is valuable: it keeps both the skeptic and the believer 
real.
