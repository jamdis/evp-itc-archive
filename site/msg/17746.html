<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Good luck with that!  It&#x27;s just been my experience that when I get these dates/prediction and ask questions about it, &quot;they&quot; give all kinds of bogus crap that &quot;they&quot; swear is true and 100% acurate. Very frustraitng!

 I can get some cussing and name calling voices that tends to show it&#x27;s not broadcast fragments, or imagination, and I have gotten a couple things as predictions, that I didn&#x27;t post cuz it seemed rediculous, but turned out true.

&gt; Thanks for posting the results.  But, I don&#x27;t think it was a real test anyway, since nothing specific was given before the event.  And it&#x27;s too easy to retrofit vague predictions once a date has past.
&gt; 
&gt; For the next test, to &#x27;pin it down&#x27;, I&#x27;d recommend full details before the test.

&gt;        Well, it&#x27;s the 18th and nothin&#x27;!  Although we didn&#x27;t really know what al the hub bub aobut the 17th was, just I was getting that repaetedly through the boxes. I think about the hard feelings created over this stuff, and just think WTF-over!  Does any of it mean anything? We get enough to show ourselves and some others that something is going on, somethign talks, but tha&#x27;ts about all that can be said.
