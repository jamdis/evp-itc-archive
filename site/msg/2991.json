I have strong convictions regarding the boxe=\r\ns, having been up close and personal (shall we say) on several different oc=\r\ncasions.  I have analyzed EVP from many locations and still strongly believ=\r\ne that the box does not work for everyone.  I believe that your intentions =\r\nare good giving our conversations in the past and wish you the very best wi=\r\nth assembly.\n \nSee, I believe that the guilds know what your intentions are=\r\n, and the sincerity behind your work and come through to those who have the=\r\nir best interest at heart.  I know that you probably think I am crazy, but =\r\nin viewing some who currently posses the devices and having changed their p=\r\nath for their own agenda, its not going to be what they in vision it to be.=\r\n  I think they could open Pandora Box and the world in which they know it w=\r\nill come crashing down upon their own accord.\n \nI know the other side knows=\r\n, and will help those in furthering their studies as they see fit.  I can o=\r\nnly say, that the respect I have for the boxes and Frank will always remain=\r\n, and I can lay my head upon my pillow at night with my integrity in take. =\r\n When I should have a box, I will know, and until then, I have the pleasure=\r\n to listen and read everyones data and studies!\n \nJuli\n \nZack Widup &lt;w9sz@p=\r\nrairienet.org&gt; wrote:\n\n\nHi Juli,Good to see you here!Frank has graciously p=\r\nrovided the schematics and other data for building one.
