One , in particular, is \nmade like a card that can be plugged into a 40 &quot;pin&quot; card slot.  The card \nwill let one mount IC chip sockets and has &quot;wires&quot; that carry the power. \nall one needs to do is soldier in the discrete components onto the \nseparate pads and make connections with short &quot;jumper wires. the plug in \ncard thing is quite easy to mount in a cabinet and work on.  Looks neat \ntoo---unlike the &quot;wire nests&quot; I used to make when I first started building \ncircuits.\nTom\r\n--=_alternative 00608746862576B0_=\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\n\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=2 face=&quot;sans-serif&quot;&gt;I always have used the boards from Radio\nshack. &nbsp;One , in particular, is made like a card that can be plugged\ninto a 40 &quot;pin&quot; card slot. &nbsp;The card will let one mount\nIC chip sockets and has &quot;wires&quot; that carry the power. &nbsp;all\none needs to do is soldier in the discrete components onto the separate\npads and make connections with short &quot;jumper wires. the plug in card\nthing is quite easy to mount in a cabinet and work on. &nbsp;Looks neat\ntoo---unlike the &quot;wire nests&quot; I used to make when I first started\nbuilding circuits.&lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=2 face=&quot;sans-serif&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/font&gt;\r\n--=_alternative 00608746862576B0_=--"}
