Just make sure he doesn't start sliding his foot or hand under the stall wall :-)

Sounds good.

Hi everyone New and Old ( meaning been here awhile LOL not age ),

It's me Ralph the Ghost Hunter again. I see things have changed since 
I been away. Seems more civilized and that's a good thing. Well juat 
wanted to tell you all about some EVP's I got at my place of work. It 
seems we have a portal to Hell or something in our men's room LOL. I 
have gotten quite a few EVP's(Tradional) in the men's room. This past 
few days I got a couple of interesting ones. I was on break from work 
so I took my DR60 digital recorder and decided to check the room for 
any spirits. I was in the stall(lol) asking if there were any spirits 
there with me, when I looked at my recorder and didn't see it pick up 
anything(have it on VOR activation)so I decided to go to the sink area.
I start asking if there are any spirits here with me and I said Is 
anyone here? I saw that the recorder was picking up sound. So I played 
it back and I heard someone say ( mind you I was all alone )" Here 
comes Lucifer" then after I asked " Is anyone here ? " A weird voice 
says " There are all kinds of Spirits ... here (here is kind of hard 
to hear)." So I'm thinking if the first voice said " Here comes 
Lucifer " the second voice might have been "Lucifer" himself saying of 
all the Spirits there. It's a creepy EVP to say the least. So what do 
you think could it have been Lucifer and could I be picking up a 
straight line to Hell or what ? Just something to think about. I got 
goose Bumps just thinking about it. Well anyways that's what went on. 
I hope you people are all doing okay. I also think I have taken a 
picture of a shadow person down in Gettysburg in the Triangular Field 
this past Nov. I'm still studying it. Hey it's nice to see everyone 
getting along that's great. You all take care and I will let you know 
of what other things I get in my search for the Paranormal. Have a 
great day all.
