<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hello everyone,

I am Clara and I live in Central California. I have been a paranormal
investigator since 2006 and I have been very fortunate to record many
messages with digital and analog voice recorders.

Within my investigative groups, I have always been the EVP tech. I
have discovered that there are many more angles to EVP than just
straight recording.

I joined your group to learn more and boy I have been so fascinated
with all the talk among you all with your equipment.

How should I start? Who can give me some good advice on what I should
try next? I am not gifted to be able to build things, maybe unless
they are very easy.

I would travel (with time to plan it) if I was able to learn more
about other methods for capturing evp.

Thank you for your time to read my message and hopefully you can help me.</pre>
