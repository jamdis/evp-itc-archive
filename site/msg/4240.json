You do the right thing as often as you can.  \nI&#39;ve seen you struggle over the years, and you always choose the path  \nthat harms no one and brings you no fame or fortune. Good on you, I  \nsay, and more of it.\n\nWe&#39;re here because we respect you, Frank, and because you provide an  \nhonest forum for this research. We&#39;re not leaving. Just try and make  \nus. ;)\n\nAnn\n\nOn Dec 13, 2007, at 10:26 AM, Frank Sumption wrote:\n\n&gt;  Well, when ya get someone giving seemingly valid reasons why these  \n&gt; new methods are invalid, or questionable, then I turn on the RS  \n&gt; hack rig, and &quot;they&quot; are singing &quot;Purple&quot; across the band, and then  \n&gt; the scan starts again at the bottom of AM with &quot;DO NOT---QUIT---- \n&gt; GROUP&quot; (the --- indicate gaps with no broadcasts or voice  \n&gt; fragments), I&#39;m supposed to believe that&#39;s just my imagination,  \n&gt; that these things don&#39;t work. The fact is all these methods work,  \n&gt; and they have in fact been used long before the box.\n&gt;\n&gt;  This &quot;Researcher&quot; I was arguing with yesterday no doubt thought he  \n&gt; had me convinced, and on his side. I can&#39;t go there after I get  \n&gt; clear, coherent, meaningful messages with these other methods. I  \n&gt; would like to keep the disaggreements friendly, and the discussions  \n&gt; friendly, and I do consider the opposing viewpoint, but it just  \n&gt; doesn&#39;t hold water in the case of these alternate radio methods.  \n&gt; That&#39;s why no interviews, and no in person meetings--as such, I can  \n&gt; be put into a postion of sympathy with a person when I don&#39;t  \n&gt; actually agree. It&#39;s called lack of assertiveness, and I did in  \n&gt; fact fail assertiveness training in the community college! As soon  \n&gt; as the meeting is over though, I&#39;m going to tell ya to bite me, and  \n&gt; do my own thing anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I think we all have to be very careful when critisizing someone&#39;s  \n&gt; work here, research, or comments--in public. So far very little of  \n&gt; the EVP stuff can be considered hard evidence, it&#39;s all what they  \n&gt; call anecdotal, or it&#39;s what one or more witnesses experienced, but  \n&gt; it&#39;s not repeatable--pretty much. Or you can&#39;t grab someone off the  \n&gt; street, have them listen to voices and expect they&#39;ll hear it.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I can&#39;t say my results are anymore valid than anyone else&#39;s&#39; but I  \n&gt; also can&#39;t accpet that anyone else&#39;s results are more valid than my  \n&gt; own. I am an independent researcher, I do this work on my own, it&#39;s  \n&gt; more like just a hobby. I don&#39;t sell anything, and I make nothing  \n&gt; by endorsing other products. When I say the Mini Box works, and the  \n&gt; Radio Shack hack works, that is the honest thing to do, it&#39;s not  \n&gt; cuz I get a kick back, as I get nothing in return, except to know I  \n&gt; did the right thing.\n&gt;\n&gt;  As for this other &quot;Researcher&quot;, I don&#39;t know what to tell ya. I  \n&gt; can only ask, give us some friggin&#39; credit! There&#39;s some good peole  \n&gt; here, and to dismiss us, and all or our results is extremely  \n&gt; insulting.\n&gt;\n&gt;  As for the possiblities of danger with this research, I&#39;ve been  \n&gt; thinking about that. First I don&#39;t know of anyone else that has had  \n&gt; any problems directly related to box use, and or paranormal work  \n&gt; fro that matter.  It&#39;s like listening to some bible thumper  \n&gt; swearing the devil is really right there, just waiting to jump down  \n&gt; your throat, and yet, there&#39;s..... nothing. So far it&#39;s more  \n&gt; threatening to cross the street every morning (I usually walk to  \n&gt; work).\n&gt;\n&gt;  I pretty much work by myself, I like it that way, and sharing what  \n&gt; I get here. I don&#39;t wanna be TAPS, or any other thing. I don&#39;t care  \n&gt; who accepts my results, I do this for myself, for my own curiosity.  \n&gt; I&#39;m not going to accept someone else&#39;s version of reality, and I  \n&gt; trust my own intuition.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;m sorry if someone thought I implied this shit came from   \n&gt; Edison, or anyone else. I don&#39;t recall that. It&#39;s more likely that  \n&gt; someone suggested it was Edison&#39;s concept, or whatever, and I kinda  \n&gt; agreed it was like that for discussion--I don&#39;t know.  I know how  \n&gt; it came about in my own mind, as problems are often solved, your  \n&gt; own subconcius mind will assemble an answer based on previous  \n&gt; experience, and I had worked with voltage tunable radios in the mid  \n&gt; 90&#39;s, then I got interested in EVP, then I used EVPmaker, then my  \n&gt; own mind connected all the dots, nothing mysterious, or other  \n&gt; worldly about it. It&#39;s that same process that takes place when you  \n&gt; sleep on a problem, and wake up with a solution. I did not  \n&gt; understand the process at first, but it&#39;s very common.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Get the power of Windows + Web with the new Windows Live.
