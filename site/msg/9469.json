The other day I finally had success using FM on the old 469 and then switched to AM.  When I went to load it onto the computer it says the file is 68hrs 26min long.  This recorder is only 256mb and at max will hold 11hr 20min, so this was quite crazy.  I only did a 13 minute session, not to mention the file size is that of 13 minutes.  I can listen to the file on the recorder and on the computer, but only in a media player, not in a sound editing program.  It&#39;s very strange because I had some great communication going on.  \n\nI keep thinking that maybe it&#39;s some sort of glitch with the recorder.  I&#39;ve tested it multiple times and can&#39;t duplicate the problem.  Who knows, could be anything.\n\nRees, it&#39;s nice to hear you had some great communication going.  Don&#39;t be too upset.  You&#39;ll always have the experience of the session and that is what&#39;s most important in my mind.\n\nJeremy\n\n----- Original Message ----\nFrom: Stefan Bion &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt;\nTo: Ron Lederer &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, April 11, 2008 7:39:33 PM\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Most amazing session\n\n                Hi Rees,\n\nAudition can recover an unsaved session in case the program (or\ncomputer) should crash.\n\nBut perhaps it was intention that the session was not saved - who\nknows... paranormal phenomena are often elusive by their nature.\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Hey  William   I believe they were training you in computer procedures.. .save file...save file...save file...you can never save too much.

Me and my fiance \n&gt; did a session, and this is how it went. \n\n&gt; We usally do 10 min. of audio, and during the session we first \n&gt; contacted a guy named Virgil, and we got him to say both of our \n&gt; names. He said &quot;William&quot; for me, and &quot;Leigh&quot; for Ashley. We all \n&gt; communicated for the 10 min. He didn&#39;t answer every question, but \n&gt; he answered 75% of all answerslast night. We told him that we \n&gt; wanted to prove that they exsisted on the other side. Life after \n&gt; death. He answer &quot;we are over here&quot;, very plainly. After the 10 \n&gt; min. We ask for confirmation so we could shut off the radio, and we \n&gt; got this answer &quot;that would be a bad idea&quot;. Which freaked Ashley \n&gt; out. So we kept the radio on and we had a conversation with this \n&gt; preacher, then while the band was still sweeping the preacher came \n&gt; through and he talked to us (while sweeping the band), and started \n&gt; to preach to us about our side, and how messed up it is.(the band \n&gt; was sweeping the whole time, I never stop the band from sweeping) \n&gt; He said that we needed to pray for our enemies as well as our \n&gt; friends and families. He talked to us for 6 to eight minutes. \n&gt; Then we finished the session (Ask for confirmation) when he didn&#39;t \n&gt; come through any more. We shut down. Then of course I get up and \n&gt; put everything back the way it is supposed to be. Leaving the \n&gt; session that we just did on the laptop. Then I went to take a \n&gt; shower, and I come back. The laptop was turned off and I lost all \n&gt; of the session. Sometimes the computer will log itself off, then \n&gt; when you get back it is exactly the was it was when you left it. \n&gt; But this wasn&#39;t the case, some reason the laptop shut itself off, \n&gt; and we lost all of the evidence that we had. Didn&#39;t have nothing, \n&gt; and I couldn&#39;t believe that we lost everything. So thats why I am \n&gt; sitting here typing away about what happen last night. Instead of \n&gt; me posting files about what happen last night. I wish so bad that \n&gt; y&#39;all would have been able to hear the communication. It was a life \n&gt; changing experience. It made me think a whole lot different about \n&gt; box research. I still can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t save it before the \n&gt; computer turned itself off. That is what happen to me last night, \n&gt; and change box research for me for the rest of my life.\n\n&gt; Thanks\n\n&gt; William Rees Clarke III\n\n\n    \n          \t\t\t\n&lt;!--\n\n#ygrp-mkp{\nborder:1px solid #d8d8d8;font-family:Arial;margin:14px 0px;padding:0px 14px;}\n#ygrp-mkp hr{\nborder:1px solid #d8d8d8;}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd{\ncolor:#628c2a;font-size:85%;font-weight:bold;line-height:122%;margin:10px 0px;}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads{\nmargin-bottom:10px;}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad{\npadding:0 0;}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a{\ncolor:#0000ff;text-decoration:none;}\n--&gt;\n\n&lt;!--\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc{\nfont-family:Arial;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc #hd{\nmargin:10px 0px;font-weight:bold;font-size:78%;line-height:122%;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc .ad{\nmargin-bottom:10px;padding:0 0;}\n--&gt;\n\t\n&lt;!--\n\n\t#ygrp-mlmsg {font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;}\n#ygrp-mlmsg table {font-size:inherit;font:100%;}\n#ygrp-mlmsg select, input, textarea {font:99% arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;}\n#ygrp-mlmsg pre, code {font:115% monospace;}\n#ygrp-mlmsg * {line-height:1.22em;}\n#ygrp-text{\nfont-family:Georgia;\n}\n#ygrp-text p{\nmargin:0 0 1em 0;}\n#ygrp-tpmsgs{\nfont-family:Arial;\nclear:both;}\n#ygrp-vitnav{\npadding-top:10px;font-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;margin:0;}\n#ygrp-vitnav a{\npadding:0 1px;}\n#ygrp-actbar{\nclear:both;margin:25px 0;white-space:nowrap;color:#666;text-align:right;}\n#ygrp-actbar .left{\nfloat:left;white-space:nowrap;}\n..bld{font-weight:bold;}\n#ygrp-grft{\nfont-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;padding:15px 0;}\n#ygrp-ft{\nfont-family:verdana;font-size:77%;border-top:1px solid #666;\npadding:5px 0;\n}\n#ygrp-mlmsg #logo{\npadding-bottom:10px;}\n\n#ygrp-reco {\nmargin-bottom:20px;padding:0px;}\n#ygrp-reco #reco-head {\nfont-weight:bold;color:#ff7900;}\n\n#reco-grpname{\nfont-weight:bold;margin-top:10px;}\n#reco-category{\nfont-size:77%;}\n#reco-desc{\nfont-size:77%;}\n\n#ygrp-vital{\nbackground-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:2px 0 8px 8px;}\n#ygrp-vital #vithd{\nfont-size:77%;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;color:#333;text-transform:uppercase;}\n#ygrp-vital ul{\npadding:0;margin:2px 0;}\n#ygrp-vital ul li{\nlist-style-type:none;clear:both;border:1px solid #e0ecee;\n}\n#ygrp-vital ul li .ct{\nfont-weight:bold;color:#ff7900;float:right;width:2em;text-align:right;padding-right:.5em;}\n#ygrp-vital ul li .cat{\nfont-weight:bold;}\n#ygrp-vital a{\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\n#ygrp-vital a:hover{\ntext-decoration:underline;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #hd{\ncolor:#999;font-size:77%;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov{\npadding:6px 13px;background-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov ul{\npadding:0 0 0 8px;margin:0;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov li{\nlist-style-type:square;padding:6px 0;font-size:77%;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov li a{\ntext-decoration:none;font-size:130%;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #nc{\nbackground-color:#eee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:0 8px;}\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad{\npadding:8px 0;}\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad #hd1{\nfont-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#628c2a;font-size:100%;line-height:122%;}\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad a{\ntext-decoration:none;}\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad a:hover{\ntext-decoration:underline;}\n#ygrp-sponsor .ad p{\nmargin:0;}\no{font-size:0;}\n..MsoNormal{\nmargin:0 0 0 0;}\n#ygrp-text tt{\nfont-size:120%;}\nblockquote{margin:0 0 0 4px;}\n..replbq{margin:4;}\n--&gt;\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
