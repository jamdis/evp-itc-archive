Wait a minute...I see now why you were  talking about "subconsc=
ious" as a 
term. It was because I said it was the  scientific term for the=
 astral. So 
yes, your right, it wasn't a true  scientific term. I just mea=
nt it was more 
of a tangible way of explaining it.  I guess the true scien=
tific term would 
be your unconscious mind, or Feud's  ID.
 
Sorry, I had t=

Science people will tell you there  is no astral. The term "Astral" w=
as 
coined by the first people who  experienced this realm. But all words w=
ere 
coined. Even words such as  dog or cat. 
 
Also, subconscious means be=
low  conscious or not conscious. So it isn't 
incorrect, though maybe some =
 scholarly types will tell you it isn't proper. 
Again, all words were  coi=
ned.
 
You have to remember that colleges and  schools are mostly made up b=
y 
people, people who think only  scientifically. I know-not all people in =
colleges 
think this way, but that  is what learning institutions are based=
 on. They 
reject any term they  can't grasp or understand under a microsco=
pe.
 
All this is besides the point  though.
