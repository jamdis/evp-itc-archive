<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Greetings Ken,

I am also a fellow &quot;licensed Ham Radio Operator&quot; and have been told 
by others that I am a &quot;Sensitive&quot;, which would explain much that has 
happened in my life.
On the subject of licensed operators, I&#x27;m guessing there may be many 
of us &quot;Hams&quot; who enjoy searching and exploring the world of heard &amp; 
unheard frequencies. It is one that is wide open at the moment. That 
is why we enjoy finding and experimenting with new techniques, 
devices, and ideas. We number many more than thirty, and there&#x27;s room 
for plenty more... Welcome to the group!

- Mike

&gt; Greetings All,  My name is Ken &amp; I&#x27;ve been reading the group for a 
few days now.
&gt; I have some observations &amp; a couple of ideas I&#x27;d like to share:
&gt; 
&gt; It amazes me how like minded intentions attract the same.
&gt; Like Rick Moran, Frank, &amp; Ron.  I too am a licensed Ham Radio 
Operator and 
&gt; am very interested in EVP,etc.  I&#x27;m also a Remote Viewer, 
Sensitive, &amp; dowser.
&gt; My studies have taught me that these things basically work on the 
same principles.
&gt; In Physics there&#x27;s something called Quantum entanglement.  In a 
nutshell, Its the 
&gt; idea of all things being familiar &amp; related due to their physical 
make up.  Like identical 
&gt; twins separated at birth, all things are connected and aware of one 
another, even though
&gt; miles apart &amp; separated for years.  Also, just as time &amp; space 
exists in a vacuum, all
&gt; things live forever.  Once a word is spoken or an attitude is acted 
out its effects can be 
&gt; witnessed forever, (Like dropping a pebble in water &amp; watching the 
ripples).  When I was 
&gt; teen I overdosed on some chemically treated weed.  I had an OBE &amp; 
saw the tunnel of 
&gt; white light thing, had the whole experience.  Ever since then I&#x27;ve 
understood that we are 
&gt; multidimensional, nothing dies, it only evolves or changes energy 
forms.
&gt; 
&gt; People will always shy away from &amp; fear that which they don&#x27;t 
understand.  
&gt; They try to label things as evil, good, right, &amp; wrong.  Things are 
relative.
&gt; Your intentions are what makes things what they are.  You will 
always find
&gt; what you look for.  Keep up the good work, its all very interesting.
