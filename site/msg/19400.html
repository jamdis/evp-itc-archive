<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>That&#x27;s a lot of responsibility as a box user, but I definitely want to learn to undertake it well, it&#x27;s heartbreaking to keep hearing them and feeling like you don&#x27;t know how to help.... I&#x27;m going to start praying more and basically just keep repeating over and over they need to go to the light... I think my mistake has been trying to hear a confirmation back from them, like an actual conversation... cause in reality if they&#x27;re trying to find the light they should be concentrating on themselves, not on getting back to you with an answer...
