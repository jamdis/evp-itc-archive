I adjusted \nbrightness, contrast, curves and levels to bring out what was hidden \nfrom the naked eye and there where quite a few spirit images in the \ncapture and what was thought to be a woman was actually a man with a \nbeard.\n\nI&#39;m posting it in the photo section under Frank&#39;s pic."}
