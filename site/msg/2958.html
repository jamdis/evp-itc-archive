Welcome to the group!
   
  Sometimes people post them in the file area but since theres limited space there we often attach them to the posts, you only get those if you are a member and have your group settings set to individual email. That sends every post as an email but also includes all file attachments.
   
  Hope that helps

          Hi,

I see where you all are talking about current file postings but I can't 
seem to find them in the files area. Am I doing something wrong.
Or is there another area I need to go to?
