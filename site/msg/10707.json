One of the \nmajor Psychomanteums (big &quot;P&quot;) that Moody visited was a huge complex \nwhich culminated in a large, darkened room containing a huge, bronze or \ncopper kettle filled with water wherein particpants could commune with \ntheir ancestors.\n\n http://www.psychomanteum.org/history.html\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Bryan Whatley &lt;bryan_whatley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s pretty cool.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think Nostradamus did use something similar with fire and water \ngazing, also called scrying (often used with a mirror too), along with \nmeditation, nutmeg as a hallucinogen, and a plethora of other \ntechniques.
