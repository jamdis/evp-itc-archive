<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>There is the &quot;Black Hole antenna&quot; invented by John F. Sutton of NASA. 
I&#x27;ve built a couple of these for different target frequency ranges and 
they work amazingly well.  They are broadbanded over several decades. You 
just have to build your own and then get the hang of tuning them 
initially ... no one sells one of these beasts and many people don&#x27;t evne 
believe they will work.

&gt; Well, I thought Radio Shack offered some power antenna boosters,
&gt; definitely for FM and maybe even AM.  In this case, I think FM is
&gt; what&#x27;ll plug into your RS radio.  I didn&#x27;t know it would only work
&gt; for one channel...hhhmmm.
&gt;
&gt; Here is a Radio Shack item # to pop into their search box:
&gt; 15-1859 (not sure if this will work or not)
&gt;
&gt; The other idea would be to buy a very long length of antenna wire and
&gt; add a male plug to the end of it that fits into the radio (1/8th).  I
&gt; would be screwing it into something big and made of metal!  That may
&gt; not make it too mobile, but you have to find some audio bits out
&gt; there somewhere to start... ;)
