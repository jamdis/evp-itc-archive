Now, after about 4=\r\n0 years of study, I can understand why it&#39;s not wise for the unintiated to =\r\nattempt this work, and why the angels constantly say &quot;just stop it!&quot;, as th=\r\ney told me for years, and still do. It is also very unwise to expose the un=\r\nintiated to this stuff. Initiated meaning that certain level of understandi=\r\nng that&#39;s hard to describe. Perhaps the wrong word?\n You can choose to igno=\r\nre all the warnings, as I do, but you better be 100% honest, with yourself =\r\nespecially!
