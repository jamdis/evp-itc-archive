&gt; Yeah, and I&#x27;m not all that good at it either! I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;ll 
work 
&gt; better if the audio went to an echo box. I have my board all ready 
to test, 
&gt; all the jacks and volume controls wired in, and the echo box made 
and 
&gt; connected, but got side tracked on a bike, I wanted to figuire out 
the 
&gt; underseat steering.
