We are in  southeastern PA, right outside Philadelphia.

I have sensed - s=
een and heard things all my life. My first clear memory of seeing a spirit =
was when I was four years old.

 

I use various combinations of hacked rad=
ios to enhance our spirit communication sessions. When we get all three psy=
chics together we really get some activity. 

 

We will be at Fort Mifflin=
 tomorrow night - there is a live broadcast from 6-7 on para-x..you should =
check it out, Mark (the host) from CCPRS uses itc and the puck.

I agree, Larry! (and I am a psychi=
c, lol)

I did not watch the show because my group and I were actually out =
investigating  something last night. As it is we are very busy with cases, =
box research and other research and projects. We do not, therefore, have ti=
me to watch other people,often pathetic wanna-be famous para-celebs, preten=
d to be what we really are.

 

I wrote a blog about this whole thing - in =
this field, thos that can do..those that can't sit and watch others pretend=
 to do ti on TV.

I have to admit that I thought I had s=
een the worst 'paranormal' show on television already. I was wrong. Door to=
 the Dead has exceeded my worst expectations.

 

Generally, I respect John=
 Oliver's work as a medium. While I have no personal experience with him, i=
n the past he has looked and acted more genuine than not, the rolling of th=
e eyes put aside for the moment.

 

I do take exception to the characteriz=
ation of the talking box as an Edison device. I have documented the history=
 of Edison, ITC and EVP  [http://www.sdparanormal.com/EdisonWhitePaper.html=
] elsewhere. This is however the smallest concern I have with this show.

 =


Prior to wathcing I had just had a conversation with a respected colleagu=
e on the West coast regarding interesting phenomena he and others are const=
antly observing in sites with phenomena similar to that on Door to the Dead=
. None of those measurements were made by this team. The use of thermal in =
this situation is not indicated as well.

 

The real concern is that no at=
tempt was made to help this family in a broader context. The skeptic did an=
d said nothing skeptical as far as I could tell. Key questions were not ask=
ed (at least on-camera) that would reveal the psycho-dynamics of this famil=
y. We know fairly well at this time that PK phenomena is often centered on =
a focal person who can exhibit specific characteristics. That the team seem=
s unaware of this is quite disturbing to a person like myself.

 

A real r=
esearch opportunity was lost in this case, as was an opportunity to educate=
 the public on the right way to approach such situations. Continually sendi=
ng the messages that phenomena is based on 'demons' and 'spirits' exclusive=
ly does nothing to further the position of serious investigators, which is =
perhaps most troubling of all.
