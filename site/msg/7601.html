Yes LC, I bought a select a tenna but it must be set for one channel and I think it is only for a.m.  I have tested it but don't notice a difference.  I have seen some of the homemade coil deals on the web...can't do that.  Any ideas, let me know.  Ron

them...if you get my drift. Good stuff at your end. Ron L
