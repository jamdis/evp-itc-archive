One of the steps is to &quot;tune&quot; the individual energy\nsignature of the target you want to affect. It is a non-local action\nso the effect can take place anywhere no matter how far the target is\nfrom the machine operator. This &quot;tuning&quot; is what attracts me to see if\nthe combination scrying on the stick pad while adjusting a frequency\ndial can in any way be useful to ITC work.\n \n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Frank Sumption&quot; &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve heard of the Hieronymus machine, but don&#39;t remember, or don&#39;t\nknow what \n&gt; it is.
