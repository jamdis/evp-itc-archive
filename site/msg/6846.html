  Thank you for posting that.  Atleast I feel like I am not the only one now.  Maybe we should make a bumper sticker of what you said about ghosts and sent it to A & E.  Would they get the idea?

I'm on a forum with the mother of one of the kids.  She says that it is real, but there are some issues on the production end.  Basically any attempts at the technical side of investigation gets cut.  The kids aren't used to being on camera, so you do see a lot of retakes that seem rehearsed.  She was also not thrilled that they chose to emphasize so much demonic stuff right off the bat.  That was way out of balance.

No, I was also howling over that.  So talking to dead people is bad, eh?  Maybe I should take their word for it that all dead people are nasty, negative entities, as well.  This kind of thing drives me nuts.  Repeat after me, A&E: Ghosts are people, too!
