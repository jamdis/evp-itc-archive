Yeah, they do that a lot. They call me=
 "urkel" all the time and call 
frank "Purple". I even heard one of kristin=
's files say "Nitsirk", 
which is her name backwards. It's almost like they=
 read these yahoo 
groups too. They also probably do that to get our attent=
ion, 
shouting out a nickname would catch most people off guard and make 
t=
hem listen more.
