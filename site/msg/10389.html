Frank,
 
Thank you for your input.  I have already informed Bruce that all his  emails 
have been given to the local police department via the local beat cop  here 
who is a really nice guy.  The next step which I will do today is to  contact 
the local police department where he lives and provide them with all the  
emails and his threats. Which shall be done later today.  I shall see if  they can 
talk some sense into him but if not then the FBI will be the next  step.
 
Thank you for your advise.
 
Jeff

I don't know what to do about it--oh yeah, see below! I've had  
arguements in the past and almost got fired cuz the other person  
forwarded all my responses to my boss, who happened to be my e-mail  
provider. I don't want to go there again. 

I have to ask, or wish I  could ask, if these people are possessed 
before, or after box use? I  suspect it's before, I hope it's before, 
or I have some serious karma to  deal with. 

It is a federal crime to threaten and intimidate using  e-mail and 
the internet, and the FBI does have an on-line reporting  center. It's 
title 18 something.
