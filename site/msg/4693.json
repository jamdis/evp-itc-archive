That redish colored torn stuff is a circuit trace torn off the\n&gt; board, it&#39;s green colored on top, and copper colored on the\n&gt; underside.\n&gt;\n&gt; Those are surface mount connectors, and wires would have to be\n&gt; soldered on the connector tabs, then spliced onto the board.

We&#39;re not extremely talented in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; electronics area, but we have fun and seem to muddle by. No guts no\n&gt; &gt; glory, huh?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well, for the most part the operation has been a success. I\n&gt; &gt; photographed every step of the way and taped screws and parts to the\n&gt; &gt; photos so we&#39;d know how to rebuild everything we took apart, and\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; has worked just fine. I located the IR filter, removed it and cut\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; replaced it with a piece of glass slide.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The one problem we ran into is that there were two wires that\n&gt; appeared\n&gt; &gt; to be clipped in place as opposed to being soldered or screwed in\n&gt; like\n&gt; &gt; everything else. When we tried to pry the clips open, instead the\n&gt; &gt; whole thing came off the circuit board. WE HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO\n&gt; PROCEED\n&gt; &gt; FROM HERE. I don&#39;t know if we can just glue the darn things down and\n&gt; &gt; if so, what type of glue to use, or if we&#39;re just plain up the\n&gt; creek.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I immediately thought of this group of brainy electronics buffs. I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; hoping someone out there can give us some advice, or if you live\n&gt; near\n&gt; &gt; Highlands Ranch, CO, you could help in person & bail us out of\n&gt; this. I\n&gt; &gt; was hoping to take this camera to the St. Augustine Lighthouse at\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; end of this coming week.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is there any hope? I&#39;ve posted a photo of an extreme closeup of the\n&gt; &gt; clips (one is pink, the other is ivory) and the damaged board -- I\n&gt; had\n&gt; &gt; to sandwich two photos together to get both in focus at the same\n&gt; time\n&gt; &gt; (that&#39;s why it looks that way). For an idea of scale, the clips are\n&gt; &gt; both the same size, about 4 mm in width, 4 mm tall, 3 mm deep. Not\n&gt; &gt; easy to handle and even harder to see with these middle age eyes.\n&gt; &gt; http://www.tejadadesign.com/camera/splice.jpg\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any advice would be GREATLY APPRECIATED!!
