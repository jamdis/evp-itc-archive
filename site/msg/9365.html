<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The communication was done not via radio, but telephone directly to
the researchers homes. There were numerous telephone calls made to
Maggy Harsch-Fishbach, Mark Macy and even to Sarah Estep. These phone
calls were made by members of the group on the Other Side working with
ITC researchers during the 1990&#x27;s. The group working with the ITC
researchers were guided by seven Ethereal beings on the Other Side
called The Seven. Contact was not only made via telephone, but also
fax and files placed in Maggy Fishbach&#x27;s computer. :)

I highly recommend Mr. Macy&#x27;s book, Miracles In The Storm. He has much
of this information on his website. http://worlditc.org

Many Blessings All,

&gt; And were using Hacked Radios to talk to the dead! I am not sure I

&gt; &gt; That is the phone call made to Mark Macy by Konstantin Raudive. Mr. 
&gt; Macy talked about this phone call in his excellent book &quot;Miracles In 
&gt; The Storm.&quot;
