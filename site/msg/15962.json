Many out of town at the various \n events or dealing with family and work. Some are recovering from having \ntoo  much fun.\n\nA tech in reference to evp usually represents what some  others call a \nguide.

They often appear over and over and act as a &quot;lead&quot;  for the \ngroup of speakers.\n\nAs for how long you record personally I have  to say short is better. I \nfind that spirits speak in bursts of energy and if I  record for long periods \nof time I get very little but if I record for a short  period of time they \nmake much better use of that time. Also it is much easier  to analyze short \nrecordings in depth.\n\nThe only time Ive recorded long  sessions is if I am in a group or circle \nand want to record whats being said  by us as well as spirit. Being out on \ninvestigations one might choose to  record there longer as you document your \ninvestigation but for straight evp  work i usually do between 30 seconds and \n3 minutes and no longer. They use the  time wisely. And the voices are much \nlouder. When doing the group or circle  such as with a medium they also have \nbeen loud as we were but again its much  more energy in the room when doing \nthose things.\n\nAgain its just my  viewpoint and others may think differently or have \ndifferent experiences.
