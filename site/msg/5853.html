<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yes, I agree it sounds like an EVP imprinted overtop.  
Interesting...thanks for working on this as I could not make anything 
out for a day or so, but knew it had a message in it.

However, I now hear what Hultay pointed out: &quot;The earth...they 
need...our word.&quot; She sounds deliberately trying to speak slowly and 
loudly to get this message across.  I am blown away by it.

&gt; LC, I cut out all the crap in between the female wordsand yes I 
believe this to be a traditional EVP imprinted over the box 
recording. What I pulled out Say&#x27;s &#x27;your crops being destroyed&#x27;let me 
know if that has any significance. Bruce

&gt; Steve/Bruce, can you listen to the woman&#x27;s voice on the recording I 
posted a few threads ago and tell me what you think she is saying? It 
sounds more like an EVP.LC--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &#x27;Steve

I think the (amplified) speakers add quite a bit of hiss and then &gt; a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; microphone has to pick up the bouncing sound, hiss and ambient 
&gt; noise -&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not as clear as direct recording a session (I 
would assume).&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LC&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.AngelsGhosts.com&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
