Had you mentioned the term aloud? I&#39;m just curious about the\nword choice. It strikes me more as a deliberate choice made by an\nentity familiar with paranormal jargon.\n\nThoughts?\n\nAnn\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday\n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; No context, I find that sometimes not often earthbound spirits will\n&gt; be drawn to a live box session kind of like a moth is drawn to a light.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I believe the energy that flows back and forth between our world and the\n&gt; spirit world is a strong attractant on both sides. So now and then\nyou will \n&gt; get a stray spirit on either side that will visit the area of the\nsession.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If they are on the other side they will piggy back the flowing\nsignal and deliver a random message or word.\n&gt; If on this side they will use the boxes energy to place the message\ndirectly onto the recorder. \n&gt; Hence the different sound of this message as apposed to a usual box\nmessage.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: lisby@...: Thu, 7 Feb 2008 19:36:01 -0500Subject:\nRe: [EVP-ITC] New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Wow.
