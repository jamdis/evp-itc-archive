 useless.  I'm rushing on yet another proto type, one that gets rid of rand=

 sound chamber. Then---it's time to play with tones. 
 
 Random mode, depsi=

To ALL member=
s of this group,
I agree with Steve. Ive told you all this many times yet s=
ome of you like to get caught up in the heat of the moment.
 
It is very di=
sturbing to watch you all try to win this war of words. There is no winner =
just a bunch of losers. And while you are busy losing theres no GOOD resear=
ch being performed by YOU.
 
How much research did YOU do today? How much t=
ime did you spend firing off replies to attempt to respond to someone you d=
ont even know about something that doesnt even involve YOU? How much time d=
id you spend replying to join in the arguments you feel do involve YOU?
 
T=
he point being, this is a research group for ITC not a boxing room and defi=
nitely your own personal battlegrounds. Take that elsewhere. Healthy discus=
sion is one thing but I have seen very few people offering that. In fact I =
know a few of you joined here just to go after someone who ticked you off. =
Then there are those who just seem to be firing in all directions, taget do=
esnt matter.
 
Get a grip people!! Ive seen 4 year olds with more self cont=
rol. If you arent interested in researching ITC for yourself then what the =
heck are YOU doing HERE. 
 
ONCE AGAIN THIS IS AN ITC RESEARCH GROUP!! 
 
A=
s for the box Frank is and always has been the first/primary tester of any =
box he has built. 
 
lol
Misty
 
P.S. I think you all are capable of findin=
g better things to do, if not let me know and I will give you a few ideas =
=3D)
