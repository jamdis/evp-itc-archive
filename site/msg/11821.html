I would try emailing him agin, i talk to him every couple of days and for s=
ome reason a lot of emails go to his junk box, even a few of mine. Try putt=
ing somthing in the title about Ghost or paranormal. I think that should he=
lp it not go to junk.

Thanks.
I have emailed Rob recently (and some time back I=
 recall), but 
received no reply to date. He may not be giving out plans an=
ymore, or 
is not monitoring his emails - dont know. 

Only other chance is=
 getting plans from someone who has received them 
already.
