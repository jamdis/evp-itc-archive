&gt;  7.      Seven represents the enlightened person, full special 
&gt; orientation, awareness of 
&gt; manifestation. Seven represents perfect groupings, fullness of 
&gt; planetary and angelic 
&gt; orders. Seven symbolizes perfection of order, energies and 
spiritual 
&gt; principals. Seven 
&gt; represents eternal life and the perfection of a complete cycle. It 
&gt; symbolizes a fresh start 
&gt; after a cycle has been completed and positive regeneration. Seven 
is 
&gt; the fullness of 
&gt; space and time and the fullness of the universe in motions. Through 
&gt; its hidden 
&gt; properties, the number seven maintained all things in being, 
mundane 
&gt; and spiritual, and 
&gt; bestowed life. Seven is the number of crowning achievement.
&gt; 
&gt; A modern interpretation of the number seven affirms that you are on 
&gt; the right spiritual 
&gt; path and that what you are working on creating is very close to 
&gt; coming into being.

&gt; us have been getting.
