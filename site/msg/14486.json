So we need to talk about what you mean by tha=\r\nt.\n\n        When you use the microphone, you just speak, and let the record=\r\ner do the rest.  In this case, you are using the recorder without really kn=\r\nowing how it works.   If a spirit can manipulate the EMF field around the A=\r\ntoD converter (even without using the mic), then they should be able to do =\r\nthe same: just use it without knowing how it works: the recorder does the r=\r\nest.  In neither case do either of you need to know how it works, to get it=\r\n to work. I am not questioning this.\n\n        But, if they are going to cha=\r\nnge the bits on the actual media themselves, then they must know how it wor=\r\nks, it order to get all those bit-things I mentioned right.  The recorder c=\r\nan&#39;t &quot;do the rest&quot;, because by changing the bits on the media themselves, t=\r\nhey are going completely around what the recorder does, and doing the detai=\r\nls themselves.  And as I said, the details there are very technical, and in=\r\nclude things like converting their words into digital samples of groups of =\r\na specific number of bits in a specific format on specific places in specif=\r\nic orders with other specific other bits connected to them like file owners=\r\nhip and dates and such.  It is the job, basically, of a computer, not a per=\r\nson.\n\n        If they are changing the bits on the media, then the recorder=\r\n is not doing that.  They are no longer letting the recorder &quot;do it&quot;, like =\r\nyou or they would be if they just used it normally.  The reason you can &quot;ma=\r\nke it work&quot; without understanding it, is because the recorder is doing the =\r\nwork for you.  If they are to change the media directly, then the recorder =\r\nis no longer doing the work, and so they must understand all those digital =\r\nissues.\n\n        So that is the difference between being able to use it wit=\r\nhout understanding it, and not being able to use it.\n\n\n\n        --- On Wed,=\r\n 5/20/09, April Abercrombie &lt;april@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n =\r\n         From: April Abercrombie &lt;april@...&gt;\n     =\r\n     Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: I have a question.\n          To: EVP-ITC@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com\n          Date: Wednesday, May 20, 2009, 3:11 PM\n\n\n          =\r\n=EF=BB=BF \n\n          My point was that they don&#39;t need to know how it work=\r\ns for it to work, like my analogy of when I speak into a microphone.
