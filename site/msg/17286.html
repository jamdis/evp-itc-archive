<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

Though I&#x27;d been lurking briefly, and I always try to get a sense of groups&#x27; tones before introducing myself, I&#x27;m still very much a newbie here.

So, I&#x27;m sorry if I sound amazingly obtuse.  I don&#x27;t always &quot;hear&quot; sarcasm in text, at least until I&#x27;ve been on a list longer and get a better idea of the more vocal personalities.

I understand some of the &quot;hornet&#x27;s nest&quot; issues, at least from a ghost hunting perspective.  I generally avoid the poltergeist/ghost issue, though I have opinions as admittedly shaky as everyone else&#x27;s.  (For me, the poltergeist:water connection is most interesting.) All in all, I try to keep an open mind.

That said... the recording with the woman&#x27;s voice saying things including &quot;Contact his box&quot;... that&#x27;s on the level?  If so, that&#x27;s startling.  I heard some unexpected and clear voices on the box Chris Moon was using, but if that&#x27;s real, this throws another large wrench/spanner in my mental works.  

I love it when compelling new (at least, new to me) data kicks my smug assumptions, hard.

Of course, if that wasn&#x27;t posted as a real recording, I&#x27;m going back to lurk mode now, blushing scarlet.

Cheerfully,
Fiona</pre>
