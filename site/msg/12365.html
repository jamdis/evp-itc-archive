Wow, this is def. weird. I just got this=
. A real evp while doing a 
sweep with my RS Hack. You'll hear me say: "Any=
thing you'd like to 
say?" and all else is spirit. Sounds to me like a Brit=
 accent saying 
"I think you're beautiful." which is common as he tells me =
through the 
Ovilus, Robot Box, and now recording live.

There's an odd noi=
se before the male voice and a mumble after. Very 
weird. There was nothing=
 except the RS Hack on at the time, but this 
didn't come over the radio.
