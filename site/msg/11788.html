<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>First it has to have the digital, or number display instead of the 
needle that moves across a dial. Then I have go inside with a scope, 
or meter looking for a point that is changing voltages while a tuning 
button is held down. Then I try to find the source of the tuning 
voltage so I can cut the trace coming from the processor. Every once 
in a while I find a radio that has the radio functions marked, like 
in the Radio Shack 12-469, or 820. The 12-470 has similar markings, 
but it&#x27;s alot more difficult to use. 

 I use to think I had to use older digital car radios, but I&#x27;m find 
newer radio usable, like digital clock radios, and radio/cd players.

&gt; what do you look fot inside the cheap radios to mod? is it a mute 
function, or do you have to build a circuit for tuning?

&gt;   Yet another thrift store radio, a &quot;digital&quot; AM/FM/CD player. It 
has the advanrage of already existing audio amplifiers, and line in 
and out. I gutted the CD portion so I can add a sweep board. This 
thing was made in 2006, so my assumption that newer radio would be 
unusable is incorrect, as well as my thought that I had to use car 
tuners, which are pure C-R-A-P!
