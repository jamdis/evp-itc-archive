of humor sometimes in this field. some people take themselves so
seriously sometimes... lol

&gt; OMG, I can&#x27;t stand extreme editing. I don&#x27;t edit my recordings unless  
&gt; I amplify. That&#x27;s it. I feel it ruins the validity of the recording by  
&gt; hacking it together. I also noticed that those who do this neglect to  
&gt; tell the general public they edit their recordings to the point of me  
&gt; even wondering if they can be considered credible. So that&#x27;s my 2  
&gt; cents on that.
&gt; 
&gt; A duel you say? That might be fun! What shall we use? Frank sent my  
&gt; Ghost Box #35 &amp; I really need to sit down and play with it more.

&gt; wisteria, definitely a female!
