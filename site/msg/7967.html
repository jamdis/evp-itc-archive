Hello Bruce,

I am one of the Newbies.  My name is Cheri & I am with Northe=
rn Alliance of Paranormal Investigators, which is based in Wisconsin.   I a=
m really just kind of lurking at this point.. trying to learn enough to ask=
 some intelligent questions.

So far I have to admit- I am overwhelmed at t=
he knowledge I am finding here- the more I learn- the more I discover I kno=
w nothing at all!

Cheri!

Subject: [EVP-ITC] to all the new people




  There seems to be a few name=
s here that I don't recognise. Seems a 
  few people have joined since I ha=
ve been gone.

  So I feel I must introduce myself. My name is Bruce Hallid=
ay, I have 
  been a box researcher for quite sometime and have the distinc=
t honor 
  to have owned not one but two Frank's boxes and currently am doi=
ng 
  research with the latest model frank has given out. I also have and 
=
  do research with every other box that is available today. I have been 
  =
away from this group for a couple of months now. I have decided to 
  retur=
n to this group for the outstanding amount of professionalism 
  here.

  I=
f there are any of the new people or even the old timers that may 
  need s=
ome help or have a question, please do not hesitate to ask.

  I mainly cam=
e back for the specific reason, of helping whom ever I 
  can. I would like=
 to share my experience and help to create as many 
  productive researcher=
s as possible.

  Thanks for listening
  Bruce
