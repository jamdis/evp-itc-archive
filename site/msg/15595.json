Or told the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; audience what they wer=\r\ne supposed to hear first. They never just played the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; soun=\r\nd (without the leading questions), and gave the audience some time to&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; decide what it was saying on their own.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So while the history at the start was interesting,\n=\r\n all the examples were,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sadly, more examples of how peopl=\r\ne can fool themselves with pareidolia, than&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; examples of s=\r\npirit communications.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Note also, this also explains why prerecording noises, and =\r\nusing them&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; later for the source of a Q/A session, still w=\r\norks. It&#39;s a tricky&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; explanation when trying to explain ho=\r\nw spirits are &#39;changing&#39; the sounds at&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; session time. But =\r\nit is an easy explanation that it wouldn&#39;t matter whether&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n the sounds were live or recorded, if it was just people hearing what they&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted to hear.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; I realize that many people aren&#39;t out to prove anything, and that&#39;s fi=\r\nne:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; but in this case, it seemed a point of the interview =\r\nwas to demonstrate the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; efficacy of the box. In\n this case=\r\n it would be better to either state they do&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; not expect th=\r\neir examples to be prove anything, or if they expect to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nonvince an audience, to use better testing of their results, and less&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; leading of the audience.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; imho&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoog=\r\nroups .com&lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc329.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3DEVP=\r\n-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://us.mc329. mai=\r\nl.yahoo. com/mc/compose? to=3DEVP-ITC% 40yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Misty Dawn &lt;bulletbabea@ &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with Shane.

It&#39;s a wonderful example of teamwork and trea=\r\nting this research (and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; each other) with honesty and dign=\r\nity, instead of some of the egotistical&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; lies and deciet t=\r\nhats being spread around out there.
