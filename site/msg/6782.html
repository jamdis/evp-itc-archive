Robin,
 
I very much appreciate your comments and confidence in me, but at=
 the end of the day I'm no different than anyone else.
The only thing that =
may set me apart from some of the other researchers here is that I have a b=
it more experience and 
being disabled allows me a lot more time for resear=
ch. I am always willing and hopefully able to help new researchers with 
my=
 advice and knowledge I have gained through experience. But my ideology is =
not the end all explanation or truth of box research
all opinions here are =
valuable and deserving of consideration and attention.
 
As for your questi=
on, the fact that I am blessed enough to receive a fairly good level of com=
munication I believe is based once 
again on the relationship I have built =
with my tech/guides and the synchronization of energy we have developed.
Th=
e level of communication we are at I believe is only the very tip of the ic=
eberg. My goal in "MY" research is to reach a level of communication that 
=
allows us to speak easily and freely with our spirit friends in a fluid and=
 continual fashion as if having a pleasant telephone conversation.
 
The gi=
st of the messages I am receiving now are directed toward our spirit counte=
rparts achieving the same goal. It is already a comfort to me to know they =
are there and I have had the opportunity to speak with close family members=
 and friends that have crossed over. And also recently Ms. Sarah Estep who =
has made the transition and is beginning to work now on the
spirit side to =
further the communication. Any information I receive from the spirits I rec=
ognise to be friends is invaluable. Something as simple as a yes or no answ=
er to a direct question that has just been asked is a small miracle in and =
of itself. considering how it was attained and where it is from. Most resea=
rchers I think after a certain amount of time succumb to the human flaw of =
complacency and take for granted that when they turn a box on they will rec=
eive communication. They loose site of the fact that this communication is =
a precious gift to mankind and eventually will change the way we perceive l=
ife and death.
 
I don't know if my thinking or opinions are lucid or the r=
antings of a mad man, I'm sure a lot of people would say both. For what it =
is worth this is how I believe on the questions you asked.
for better or wo=
rse.

It's always refreshing to read your input Bruc=

As a newbie I'm admittedly intimidated by and i=

I'm still troubled by the possibility that we =

Re: File from tonight


Robin, I agree with Steve on a couple of points. Fi=
rst let me say that Ido believe that we all have a "technician/guide/guardi=
an" call them what youmay. but I usually call them by the names they introd=
uced themselves by. I know for a fact through many, many, many box sessions=
 that when I turna box on, could be Frank's box or the minibox or the RS 47=
0 does not matter which. The same two entities will come through immediatel=
y, So much so now, that I do not even ask for conformation thatit is in fac=
t them. I recognise their individual voice patterns. I have built a solid r=
elationship with these two spiritsI know as mike and Lisa so much so that I=
 have even gotten to know their individual personalities. There are other n=
ewer researchers here that will attest to the fact that when they where doi=
ng their first sessionsI had asked my two "Friends" Mike and Lisa to assist=
 in getting them started and invariably the spirits that came through to th=
ese new researchers during their first sessions identified themselves as Mi=
ke and Lisa. Steve says he does not turn on his box and use them as a crutc=
h, that is not entirely true. I had done research very closely with Steve u=
ntil recently and I would venture to say that 99% if not every session he s=
tarts with "Mike & Lisaare you available to talk with me"  Also I don't con=
sider working with my technicians as using them as a crutch, They would not=
 allow that.They are not there like butlers at our beckoned call when we fe=
el they may be of some use.Quite the opposite, without them we would get no=
 communication at all, they are allowing us the honor of receiving this cel=
estial communication. They are the moderators, facilitators and generators =
of all we hear and send to and from the spirit realm.And they also stand as=
 guards and protectors to do the best they can to keep us from being deceiv=
ed or taken down a dark path. Some here wait for others to state an opinion=
 and then tend to agree with that opinion no matter what they have experien=
ced to be true. Robin, my advice to you as a new researcher in this field. =
Form your own beliefs through your experience and research.Listen and learn=
 from others but do not let what you believe to be true or not, be swayed b=
y popular opinion. Bruce

Steve,
 
I certainly appreciate your though=
