me:



1) you hope what? that i made a fool out of myself or that i called =

I hope you called it in. Your resistance t=

dn't just say that to stop me from prompting you. I don't know of course, I=
 am not there. I have no desire that you make a fool of yourself, but if it=
 helps save a child from am abductor, I think it would be worth it.

 

2) =

=C2=A0 However, people continue to say there is more to it than my experien=

3) Why are negative people on  these lists anyway. if =
you guys don't believe in this type of technology, why the heck are you all=
 here? 



If I had absolulely no belief that there might be something inte=

<br>
1) you hope what? that i made a fool out of m=
yself or that i called it in or perhaps both?  <br>
<br>
I hope you ca=
lled it in. Your resistance to giving the police information you said you t=
hought you had on a child abductor, even after several prompts, makes me ho=
pe you did call it in, and didn't just say that to stop me from prompting y=
ou. I don't know of course, I am not there. I have no desire that you make =
a fool of yourself, but if it helps save a child from am abductor, I think =
it would be worth it.<br>
 <br>
2) Why don't you get on the box, and do som=
e asking? <br>
<br>
As I have said in the past, my experience with those bo=
xes has shown me nothing paranormal yet.  However, people continue to =
say there is more to it than my experience.  And so, I am keeping an o=
pen mind and trying to examine the evidence you provide.<br>
 <br>
3) Why a=
re negative people on  these lists anyway. if you guys don't believe in thi=
s type of technology, why the heck are you all here? <br>
<br>
If I had abs=
olulely no belief that there might be something interesting going on with t=
he technology, I would not have been so insistent that you give your inform=
ation to the police.  How could a person, of good conscience, not prom=
pt you to give that information to the police?  Again how is that a ne=
gative thing to do?<br>
 <br>
Wouldn't the really negative thing be to igno=
re it?<br>
