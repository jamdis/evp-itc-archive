But besides that, early on I was fascinated by seemingly \ncoherant sounds that would come out of random noise on my clock radio \nin my bedroom as a kid, from what sounded like voices (thought I was \ncrazy for a while) to even morse code - for a long time one of my \nradios would produce random clicks or pops even when the speaker was \noff.  My dad jokingly suggested it was morse code, so I studied morse \ncode and discovered that at least some of it could be morse \nletters...usually they would spell one word and then gibberish.\n\nAnyways, once I learned what EVP was I began messing around with \nrecorders etc.  My first clear recording came from using EVP maker \nand was someone saying &quot;we have been waiting for you.&quot;  A few days \nlater, after a frustrating lack of communication they just told \nme &quot;build a box.(this happened to be after I learned of frank.)&quot;  \nI&#39;ve been looking at all the boxes and their positives and negatives \nand this is what I&#39;m seeing:\n\nFranks models seem to produce the most consistant results but also \nseem to be less two way than some others (ie Joe&#39;s Box.)  Joe&#39;s Box \nand the new radio shack mod seem to have some very clear voices \ncoming through but skeptics can argue that all you are hearing is \nsnippets from radio broadcasts.\n\nMy thought for a cost-effective, low-tech alternative is to combine \nthe two in that you create a radio shack mod like the UFOGeek one \n(multiple radios, a mixer, etc) and run it through an echo box.\n\nPersonally I believe that analog is giving the best results overall, \nand I think it has to do with ease of manipulating the signal.  \nTherefore my thought is taking a digital white noise signal like that \nproduced by the radio shack mods and then essentially broadcasting it \ninto the echo chamber and having a mic pick it up gives you the \nanalog aspect.\n\nMy question is has anyone tried this?  And I was hoping for thoughts \non the pros and cons of using AM vs. FM or both.\n\nOh, one other thing- any programmers/engineers out there?  Someone \nthat could write code to allow us to randomly band scan a digital \nradio?"}
