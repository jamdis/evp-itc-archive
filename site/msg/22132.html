<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank,

You are no the only one that builds circuits and others can help.  Get rid of your transistor you are using in zener mode and replace it with an AD706.  Look at the datasheet for the noise and take that figure to use in your calculations for amplification.  replace the other components that give you the correct level of amplification and now your random circuit will work just fine.

People have a tendency to put up walls and even attack when they feel threatened or they are being attacked.  I feel you were putting down my ability to design an electronic circuit.  That is one thing I am extremely good at.  

If you listened to Steve&#x27;s radio show last week, I explained how I came into using boxes to hear spirits and what I do with them.  I don&#x27;t condone how TV shows treat spirits.  It pisses me off they are treated as a circus act.  I don&#x27;t believe in that and will not participate in ghost hunting or ouiga bard type games.  I use my spirit boxes to help try to solve missing person cases.  I don&#x27;t play those games.

Steve helped me when I first was learning about radio sweep.  Once he got me started, I was able to do my own research and move very quickly from there.  I did check out your schematics, but chose to go another route with my own circuit design.  I am not after fame and fortune; if you knew me you would know that is how I am.  I live a very humble life with the everyday struggles of most people. What I will not tolerate is someone taking credit for my work.

To get things straight on SB#3.  I started designing a new sweep circuit that could cover all the different possible ways you could sweep a radio.  I built it for use with my RCA super radio.  I wanted to give myself every possible chance to get better communications with the radio sweep.  I talked with Steve about my design and he asked if I could have this sweep or that sweep.  The modes he wanted were already there, I just had to break out the external controls for it.  The sweep circuit is 100% my design.  I took Steve&#x27;s inputs on what he wanted on his box, but the design is 100% mine.  On his radio show, I did give him credit for the features on the box that he suggested, but the design is mine.  He did not pay me to design a new circuit for him; he just asked if I could take my sweep circuit and build him a box to use.  That is what I did.  He supplied the radio and the batter holder.  I had already completed the laser etching on the box and had everything polyurethaned when he asked if I could put Edison on the box.  I could do it only on the inside of the back cover.  So, if you flipped the cover around how it was designed to be, you would see my design and my contact information laser etched in the wood.

Now, I am collaborating with Steve on some new ideas he has, but those are not mine unlike the design of SB#3 which is.  For what I do, the radio is not the best way to go.  My spirit keyboard design will do what I need when working on missing person cases. Some people just want to hear a voice; I want to get accurate information from the spirits and voice is very subjective.  The spirits can type on my spirit keyboard and I can see exactly what they are trying to say without my interpretation.  That is what I need.

The spirits can help us to gain information.  They are not confined by the physical world and can help us bridge time and space and possibly even dimensions.  Who&#x27;s to say what they can truelove help us with. I think it is important to keep working toward better communication devices.  I have done that.  Steve has some real good ideas, but no technical skills to get them done.  I can work with him so he can realize his ideas.

I can help other people too, but I don&#x27;t like feeling attacked especially when people don&#x27;t&#x27; know me or my abilities.  I will never take credit for someone&#x27;s designs or ideas; I have had that happen to me in the past and will not do it to others, not even you Frank.

For the radio sweep circuits, they are still radio sweep circuits no matter how they function.  I find there is no one better mode of sweeping.  They all work.  i do find the speed of sweep where you allow too much radio broadcasts through, messes with the EVP information.  So there is technique involved with using a radio sweep circuit.

I would say the main difference in your random circuit and mine, is the stability.  I took great care to make sure the random circuit was stable.  The one is SB#3 is fairly stable, but could be better.  I have since modified the design slightly that made a huge difference in the stability and adjust-ability.  It still doesn&#x27;t mean it will work any better than anything you designed; it is just different.

I wish you and Steve could work out your differences and move forward with the research.

I prefer to stay out of the lime-light and would like to keep it that way, but I will not let people bash me or take credit for all my hard work.  I started doing this for me and no-one else.  If we can put all this negativity behind us, we can move forward trying to advance spirit communications.

Frank, I don&#x27;t know you, but I do thank you for all you have done over the years to help bring spirit communications to the public.
