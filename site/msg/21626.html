<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I was just sent an e-mail from the Andy Coppock camp, so i must retract my earlier posts.

Although i had good reason to feel that i was taken for a ride, that does not seem to be the case.  Andy was apparantly bombarded with probes to modify and mine was in the batch with the rest.

I also was informed that this probe that i modified myself is an older model of what Andy used to use, but he no longer does.

They offered to make good on my lost device, which makes them top notch in my book and i no longer feel taken advantage of. 

I look forward to seeing their new work and devices some day.

&gt; Did a quick test with the inductive probe, it&#x27;s the same one that Andy  
&gt; Coppock uses.  Let me know if anybody hears anything paranormal in this  clip.  
&gt; Maybe i&#x27;ve been doing it wrong, is there a certain way to record  while 
&gt; using this?
