&gt; I think. I&#x27;m still having a hard time convincing myself that I&#x27;m not  
&gt; matrixing this whole thing, but the box has been repeating the 
number  
&gt; seven, the name Frank, the name Eva, had a bout of swearing, and 
then  
&gt; completely stunning me by seemingly saying that Tom was here, &quot;Your  
&gt; Tom.&quot; Which blew me away because I have a great uncle named Tom 
whose  
&gt; burial records I was looking for just last night. Finally a female  
&gt; voice told me, &quot;Ann stop.&quot; I said okay and she returned, &quot;Thank you.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I hope no one minds my sharing. This is a big moment for me.
&gt; 
&gt; Ann
