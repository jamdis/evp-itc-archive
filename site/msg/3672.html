<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Excuse me if I mispell some things in this post, I&#x27;m currently 
running the production board for a LIVE internet radion program going 
on right now, and I&#x27;m doing 100 things at once!

Okay... According to some, &quot;...the Spirit Technicians and Spirit 
Guides on the other side have repeatedly explained that the way that 
the Telephone to the Dead technology works, is by spirit energy 
manipulating the random voltage generator (RVG) and using white and 
pink noise, as well as radio fragment, to create real time voice 
answers to questions posed from our side. The most important aspect 
to this device is the medium operator who works as an antenna 
or &quot;interpreter&quot; for living individuals asking the questions.&quot;

So, that said (or copied and pasted) I have decided that my next 
attempt with the older version of the 12-470 will be the following:

1) Add a method of variable voltage used to adjust the tuning 
circuit, similar to the RVG mentioned above. I went out and purchased 
another older 12-470 today, to do just this.
(Frank... I did some measurements of that VT and found a range to 
work with.. I hope!)

2) Add that white or pink noise to be mixed with the sweeping raw 
audio already available from the modified 12-470.

3) Add an internal antenna for the 12-470.

4) Add an interface so the user will be a active/passive part of the 
radio. As mentioned above, as the antenna between the 
entities/spirits.

So... if I can accomplish all that... maybe the little ole&#x27; 12-470 
will be recognized by the &quot;experts&quot;, as having what the big mahcines 
now have... :-)

Wish me luck in my adventure... and oh, by-the-way... I hope to add 
all this, inside the existing case.
