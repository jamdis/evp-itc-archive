Actually had to listen to the clipped version to get it the first time, then I could pick it out on the raw.  It seemed like you mostly clipped the slack phonoics between the YES BRUCE and THEY DO THAT.\n\nWould you agree that evpmaker messages tend to include more words and complete sentences than tradition evp?  For me, it ain&#39;t easy to pick out the messages with evpmaker and probably in 50% of the samples I hear the messages only after reading the script a few times.  I trust I will improve with time.  Thanks for the comparison.
