Frank,
 
I have to disagree.
I believe they have a purpose for putting so =
much effort into relating this communication in the hopes
that we will stri=
ve to better the communication so as to get better and clearer messages tha=
t convey their precise intention.
 
Mike and Lisa have told me how difficul=
t it is to transmit this communication and they have a sense of urgency in =
their messages
trying to make us sit up and take notice. 
 
I would hate to=
 believe they do not care about the outcome of man kind and ignore our prob=
lems, no matter how petty they may seem
to a higher being. there has to be =
a method and an end to their means. I don't think they are participating in=
 this miraculous communication for entertainment.
 
If I am misunderstandin=
g your meaning, which has happened to us in the past. Please let me know.
