Subject: [EVP-ITC] Question for you all

  
Those of you who have contacted entities claiming to be dead people, what is the oldest person you've spoken to (in terms of how long ago they died)?

I'm wondering because my great uncle has been coming through a lot, and he was murdered in 1942.  Since I wasn't born until decades later, I never knew him, but I do understand that people come through we did not know in life.  Has anyone else contacted someone claiming to have lived that far back?  Or in another lifetime entirely?
