I've always loved this end of the world stuff.  The way I see it, if the =
world ends, I'm dead and I don't care.  I could just as easily die tomorrow=
 driving to work.  So if there is something you should do while you are ali=
ve then do it.  Otherwise who cares about worlds ending?

: [EVP-ITC] Why do entities lie?

  
 I've been doing "box" work for almost=
 ten years, and I still get to the decepticons( liars). Perhaps it's just a=
 level out there, as I think there is an inifinite number of levels and/or =
demensions. Maybe there is a demonic level? I have a group that communicate=
s, and they usually tell "this is an apple", a metaphor for a truth. Not al=
l of these voices are spirit per se`, some have never been human, there is =
a group out there called the fish group, a group of entities that exist off=
 planet and really enjoy screwing with EVPers.  I think it was the people-I=
 forget their names, experimenting in Luxemberg quite some time ago that fi=
rst got the Fish Group. 
 
 For me, I don't really care what comes through,=
 it's the fact that something talks that shouldn't be there, my approach ha=
sd always been on the technical side. 
 
 I get some mediumistic contacts/v=
isions, and I have some spirits that seemingly prefer telepathic contacts, =
but I don't take that as anymore gosple than anything else. Most of the "co=
mmunication" tends to be extremely trivial in nature. 
 
 As far as end of =
the world stuff, I do get that, alot of it, in almost every session, they i=
nsist it's true, at least as far as end of the cycle goes, but, and it's a =
big but, who knows what level/source that is from--they claim not to be hum=
an. Plus we do have access to the future, if I do my meditation regularly I=
 see almost everything ahead of time, plus I dream it, and I know everyone =
on this planet. I would expect spirit to be much more aware, at least after=
 they reach a higher state. Human is not the highest level, so you can't co=
mpare everything to what y'all think you know.
