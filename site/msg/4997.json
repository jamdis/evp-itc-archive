He \n&gt;     couldn&#39;t stop complaining about how I&#39;d wasted money on a perfectly \n&gt;     good piece of equipment only to wreck it for my dumb hobby, but\nonce \n&gt;     we got home he took it upon himself to test it and make sure it \n&gt;     worked. For some reason it really DIDN&#39;T work, so he took it\nback to \n&gt;     RS and exchanged it for another one, and after making sure THAT one \n&gt;     worked he even offered to help me with the modification. &quot;No\nthanks&quot; \n&gt;     I told him. &quot;I think I need to do this myself.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt;     I can&#39;t pretend the process went as smoothly as I&#39;d hoped, but \n&gt;     finally I was done and making the last turn in the second screw of \n&gt;     the circuit board.. and then.. The whole thing flew out of my hands \n&gt;     and both battery wires ripped away from their soldered ends in the \n&gt;     casing. It was all Bob could do to keep from gleefully yelling &quot;I \n&gt;     knew you were going to break it!&quot; But then I guess he felt bad \n&gt;     because he ran down to Walmart and got a soldering iron and solder \n&gt;     and spent an hour trying to put it all back together for me. \n&gt; \n&gt;     It&#39;s dead as a doornail, and I&#39;m thinking that if I could break it \n&gt;     that easily without even knowing how or why, maybe I&#39;m not supposed \n&gt;     to pursue this method (sigh). I guess I&#39;ll just think it over and \n&gt;     maybe try again later. \n&gt; \n&gt;     Thanks for all the helpful information though Mike!\n&gt; \n&gt;     Robin\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
