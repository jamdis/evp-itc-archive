<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Well, it&#x27;s his group (he doesn&#x27;t own it now but he started it) and he&#x27;s the
one who invented the box and builds them and supplies us with all the info
on them. His name is Frank Sumption.

Those of us who have been around here half of forever are used to him and
aren&#x27;t offended.

&gt; I am sorry but I do not think it is aceptible for this FS to call someone a
&gt; DICK for expessing an opinion or to say BITE ME to that person.
&gt;
&gt; on another group this would not be tolerated the person would be warned on
&gt; the group and then asked to leave. I have seen this with a few people here
&gt; and since I spoke up before I hope I will not be insulted.
&gt;
&gt; I am sorry for my earlier post I do not wish to make enimies just learn.
