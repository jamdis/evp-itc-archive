I don&#39;t use any equations, if sweep isn&#39;t fast enough, I put in a smaller capacitor. I think you are making the sweep much more complicated than needed.\n\nF-S\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Luis&quot; &lt;luispucp098@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  I post this archive , it contains equations to modify the kit for get apropiate linear circuit .
