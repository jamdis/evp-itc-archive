I sit idly by and watch 200+ people get bad \ninformation on a daily basis, which hurts any good research.  The \nbest way to go about what we are doing is to come up with our own \ntheories and post them as examples for others to read.  We shouldn&#39;t \nhave anybody dictate every aspect of this as fact.  If anybody can \ngive information on box use it would be Frank, who nobody who owns \nboxes has listened to...myself included.  He knows how they work and \noffers a great amount of knowledge to this subject or else none of us \nwould even be here.  This board has started to be a dictatorship of \none persons opinion and if nobody listened...they were wrong.  And to \nme, that&#39;s wrong.  I started out with Joe&#39;s box and moved forward and \nnobody helped me in my path.  I since aquired other boxes and taught \nmyself them as well, which means it can be done.  People...do your \nown thing and get results the best way you can and learn from your \nmistakes, that&#39;s what i did.  And getting Bruce his first Joe&#39;s box \nand Frank&#39;s box and getting him started in box research, i somewhat \nfeel responsible for what transpired on this board and i apologize to \nthose involved.  Frank, i&#39;m sorry that another person has taken your \nbox and claimed to know all and not listening to what you adhere we \ndo.\n\nNuff Said,\n-Steve H.\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;LC Duplatt&quot; &lt;lcdupla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; With all due respect, I am going to put my 2 bits in on this.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I love the sharing of info, but have elected to post less and \nretire \n&gt; to reading more. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; That said, I must agree with Ann that the initial post, though \n&gt; perhaps posted to be humorous, came off as disrespectful (in my \n&gt; opinion as a reader looking in on this forum) not only to BH but to \n&gt; FS.
