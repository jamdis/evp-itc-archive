&gt;   Just the Ten commandos, Gods word, how come they never mention there was
&gt; 613 commandments. That many, and you can&#x27;t sleep, can&#x27;t think, can&#x27;t eat,
&gt; can&#x27;t read, can&#x27;t question, can&#x27;t breed--it&#x27;s all fear crap cuz some bozo
&gt; was trying to guess what some imagined deity wanted. I think the &quot;gods&quot; of
&gt; sumeria are closer to the truth, they went away, and some duffus was trying
&gt; to figure out what we have to do to bring them back.  Only only one thing to
&gt; do...wait.

&gt;    totally agreed it IS hacked to death..we don&#x27;t even have the full
&gt; version that has been edited time and time again..Don&#x27;t get me wrong i
&gt; believe in God..I&#x27;m a spiritualist..but i do not subscribe to everything
&gt; that comes out of the bible..and if one really no the Bible they wouldn&#x27;t
&gt; either you can&#x27;t do this sorta of thing and say ooo I&#x27;m soo holy...because
&gt; in the bible eyes we are sinner..communicating with the dead..that&#x27;s why
&gt; when i see people on here saying Jesus is talking to me it makes you
&gt; wonder..

&gt;   Yeah, and funny watching the sci dorks trying to debunk it. I think it&#x27;s
&gt; like biblical, even though I don&#x27;t believe in that stuff too much. Not that
&gt; the bible is wrong, just hacked all to hell.

&gt;  That&#x27;s possible. And what if someone had set off a bomb in the upper
&gt; atmosphere causing this problem? That&#x27;s one of the theories floating around
&gt; out there on the web. Between the birds, the fish, and the crabs, I don&#x27;t
&gt; know what to think of it all, but your message could have been about that.
