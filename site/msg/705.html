Hey, Lynn and Amy!
   
  I've been on this board for a month but haven't posted because I felt a little out of my depth. :) I joined because I've recently become interested in EVP and thought this would be a good place to get pointers on capturing EVP on tape.   I had never heard of ITC before joining and am currently learning what it's about (I bought a book about ITC just last week and am fascinated).
   
  Anyway, I'm moving to Kerrville (my home town) in a few weeks .... so that will be another board member in your "neighborhood."
   
  So, hello!  
   
  -Lanza
