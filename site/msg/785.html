<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>YW, Frank! By the way, one of the participants at the recent Darkness 
Radio &quot;retreat&quot; on the Queen Mary in January had one of your boxes 
with him and was trying to demonstrate it to me but apparently the 
battery case shorted in some fashion and the holder partially Melted 
(Randy Schneider).

I&#x27;ve done a fair amount of research into the history of EVP (I prefer 
to call it PSP or Paranormal Sound Phenomena as there are 
unexplainable sounds besides voices captured AND I even have copies 
of &quot;spirit voices&quot; that were recorded via non-electronic means).

I&#x27;ve kept my (almost a full year) correspondence with Alec to be only 
with respect to the Intelligence Project as I know he&#x27;s been pretty 
busy. But I just got an e-mail from him a few days about another 
project he&#x27;s working on which I&#x27;ll tell everyone here about in a day 
or two.

&gt; Thnks Guy!! We need that. Alec and I e-mail, but rarely, so he is 
aware of 
&gt; my work. Things are starting to wind up, and more technical 
reseachers are 
&gt; beginning to test ideas.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Lest we think this forum is just the &quot;Frank/Misty/Lonestar&quot;
&gt; &gt;show... :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I&#x27;m going to start posting a few things about Alec&#x27;s work with the
&gt; &gt;Alpha Interface Unit he developed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Here&#x27;s an article from Fate magazine (July 1, 2000):
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&quot;The Alpha Mystery&quot; by Jose Feola
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;http://www.llewellyn.com/archive/fate/38/
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Plus I&#x27;m adding 2 papers Alec has written about EVP and the Alpha
&gt; &gt;Unit (particularly of importance is the capturing of EVP in a
&gt; &gt;soundproof Faraday cage):
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&quot;A Bio-electromagnetic Device of Unusual Properties&quot; (published in
&gt; &gt;the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;http://www.skyelab.co.uk/review/aa.htm
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&quot;Report of an Anomalous Speech Products Experiment inside a Double
&gt; &gt;Screened Room&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;http://www.skyelab.co.uk/review/bb.htm
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You can also buy Alec&#x27;s book and EVP sampler CD online:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;http://www.lulu.com/evp
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Next time - I&#x27;ll post about Alec&#x27;s funded EVP research project
&gt; &gt;called &quot;The Intelligence Project&quot; along with charts and the samples
&gt; &gt;that the international listening panel (which I was a member of)
&gt; &gt;judged. Hopefully - he&#x27;ll be sending me both the interim report and
&gt; &gt;final report so I can put them in the &quot;Files&quot; area.
