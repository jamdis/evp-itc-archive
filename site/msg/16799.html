&gt; I&#x27;ve been experimenting with my &quot;Tom&#x27;s Tube&quot; ghostbox and getting some pretty good and clear messages for some two months now, but have yet to contact a &quot;Tech&quot; or &quot;MC&quot; of sorts.  Until last nights session, it always seemed as if just a big crowd of entities without a common adgenda, were crowding in and speaking whatever they wanted whenever they could, and leaving me with tons or random phrases, meaning nothing as a whole.
&gt; The last half of my session last night was different however.  I appear to have been &quot;DISCOVERED&quot; by a group on the other side who have given me the longest and clearest phrases yet and seem to be a bit more organized.  Below is a transcript which some of y&#x27;all might find interesting (and even a bit funny) The groupings in the same sequence
&gt; ---------------Begin transcript-------
&gt; (loud male voice)Are we there?
&gt; (male)Expecting any?

&gt; 
&gt; (Male) The sound box
&gt; (male) It works
&gt; (male) How da ya know?
&gt; 
&gt; (male)(loud) I&#x27;m Broken
&gt; (male) We&#x27;re here!
&gt; 
&gt; (male) Precious(sic) Ben here
&gt; 
&gt; (male) A LOT of work
&gt; (male) Tell me!
&gt; 
&gt; (Group) We became a family!
&gt; 
&gt; (male) bring that sign
&gt; (male) But who&#x27;d expect it?
&gt; (male) what?
&gt; 
&gt; (Male) all the gatherings have come!
