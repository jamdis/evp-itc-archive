Or perhaps just a reference to a sharks ability to seek out energy sources.=
 Like this:
___

Sharks produce =E2=80=93 and pick up =E2=80=93 tiny electr=
ic fields, to hunt their prey. Navy researchers are looking to pull off the=
 same trick, so they can spot underwater mines.
Inside sharks' heads are je=
lly-filled canals called "the ampullae of Lorenzini," which the predators u=
se to detect the itty-bitty electrical charges a fish makes when it flexes =
its muscles, or swims counter to the earth's natural magnetic fields. It's =
a real-live sixth sense. And it's way more accurate the sharks' eyesight.
