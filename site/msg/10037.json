From ghost box research (not sound soap, or EVPmaker) I saw alot of messages/files posted  that were 4-10 words long, and you and others were bragging on how long of a message y&#39;all had, and that nobody else could get messages that long.  That is were I feel that I have been mislead.  I didn&#39;t know that those files/messages had the garbage cut out of it.  I actually thought y&#39;all got messages that long from the radio/Franks Box.  I was trying to get communication like that,  and wondered why I couldn&#39;t.  I do know now that it is physically possible to get that type of communication after I lost my session 22, but it doesn&#39;t happen like that every time.  I mean no disrespect about this situation.  Also I don&#39;t see myself as a &quot;Newbie&quot; anymore.  If you want to go by ranks, I would like to be refer ed as a &quot;amateur box researcher&quot;.  If you have anything else to say, I think it needs to be\n taken care of in private emails.

You can for\ninstance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (including\nthe experimenter&#39;s voice), filter or denoise it to make it clearer, but\nnot cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP match\nwith what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should always\nbe provided along with the edited version.\n\nBut that&#39;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to express, as\nwe should always be able to present our results to a critical public.\n\nStefan\n\n-- \n\n&gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these files.\n&gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that \n&gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the message \n&gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise that \n&gt; don&#39;t belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can&#39;t piece these \n&gt; files together to make something it&#39;s not, so i keep them in true \n&gt; form pretty much to the original.\n\n&gt; -Steve\n\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hey Steve Forgot to ask...how much editing was needed to get this \n&gt; file?
