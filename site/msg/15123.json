It is a little girl saying &quot;momma says I&#39;m a big girl&quot;. She sounds a little older than the girl tha said &quot;I want my paw&quot; from Monday in my yard. But could be the same girl that just sounded a little different today. Kinda neat......she is following me I guess :) \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Jim%27s%20RR-DR60%20EVP%27s/momma_says_i%27m_a_big_girl-no-mods.mp3 \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles\n\nRegards,\n\nclockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt;"}
