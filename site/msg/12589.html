<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Al, small world then. :)  Do you have any dealings MPI?

I haven&#x27;t been around MPI since both my mother and great uncle (Joe
Sax) died in &#x27;03 and then Pamla more recently left.  I don&#x27;t really
know as many of the people there any more to really feel comfortable
being there.

&gt; Good for you, Marty! 
&gt; MPI is going to be reworked to meet some of the newer teachings
about Spiritualism. I would love to see some of the older views (like
suicide and hell, for example) go the same way as the dinosaur. 
&gt; Currently, I am working with a teacher out of Toronto on studies
about Spiritualism. Knowing about mediumship is one thing, knowing
Spiritualism is quite another! I have had to change my perspective on
somethings, and that is a real part of the growth pattern of life.
