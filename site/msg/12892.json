Check it out if you wish...\n&gt; \n&gt; How I converted my recorder to a Raudive Diode Recorder for EVPs. This\n&gt; is just another experiment I&#39;ve done in my continuing research of ITC. \n&gt; I&#39;ll be testing it in the near future...\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the page with a picture, schematic and video:\n&gt;\nhttp://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/2008/11/raudive-diode-recorder-for-evp-c&#92;\n&gt; apture.html\n&gt;\n&lt;http://ufomagazine.blogspot.com/2008/11/raudive-diode-recorder-for-evp-&#92;\n&gt; capture.html&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; or here&#39;s just the video:\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZCfCdSgU6U\n&gt; &lt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZCfCdSgU6U&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; - Mike C.
