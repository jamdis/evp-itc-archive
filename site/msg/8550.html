<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Steve,

&gt; The inputed file is just tones, how are they creating words and
&gt; sentences?  Does anybody have a logical explanation yet?  Energy 
&gt; fields, Conincidence...etc.

Well, there are a lot of explanations for this, but none of them has
been proven yet (afaik). I tend to the &quot;synchronicity&quot; explanation - at
least when pure logical devices such as computers are used, which I
believe can&#x27;t be influenced mentally, neither by spirits nor by humans
(otherwise they would probably crash more often than already without
such a manipulation). ;)

I think that causal models aren&#x27;t sufficient to explain EVP. If no
devices are influenced directly, there must be taking place some other
form of &quot;manipulation&quot;. Perhaps the &quot;probability field&quot; is manipulated
somehow in cases where random number generators (RNG) are involved? As
we know from psychokinesis experiments in parapsychological labs, test
persons were able to get &quot;hits&quot; even when &quot;prerecorded targets&quot; are used
instead of a RNG. It seems that time and causality doesn&#x27;t matter in
respect to paranormal phenomena.
