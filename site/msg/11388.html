<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>If you think it might help you, use the candle.  It will not hurt
things.  I generally just announce I am beginning a recording session
and then say I am ending it prior to shutting down.  I believe spirit
understands your intentions so no ceremony is needed.  It is more a
matter of having spirits around at the moment that have the
energy/inclination to communicate.  The only drawback to using the
candle is becoming accustomed to it and then going somewhere where you
can&#x27;t use it when you collect EVP&#x27;s.

&gt; Is there any way to &quot;prepare&quot; for recording like light a candle, 
&gt; meditate, etc? I am thinking maybe when I start sessions I can light a 
&gt; candle and when I end them I can blow the candle out kind of like a 
&gt; signal.
&gt; 
&gt; My grandfather-in-law and my father-in-law have both passed, should I 
&gt; try and ask for them by name or should I ask for anyone available? 
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for the questions, I&#x27;ve never done this before! 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
