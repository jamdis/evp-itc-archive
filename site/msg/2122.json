I have a large \nmirror, maybe 30 inches on a side that can be used. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Some VCR tuners have a module that is the tuner, with line level \nvideo and audio outputs(that&#39;s what I&#39;m using), maybe something like \nthat can be added to a Ghost Box, then the user supplies their own \nTV/video monitor---just a thought.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  It&#39;s been longer than I thought since experimenting with video, \nthe date on the &quot;video box&quot; is July 1, 2005.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Can you find the hidden words?
