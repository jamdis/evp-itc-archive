You have to remember if they were=\r\nn=A2t nice in life there not  nice  in\ndeath. Personality=A2s  would cross =\r\nover\nalso. Usually they try and intimidate  you. I use positive  reforcemen=\r\nt. It\nusually very rare of it being anything to worry about. You can choose=\r\n to ignore\nit or confront it  telling them that you\nwould rather not hear t=\r\nhat. And if  they\ndon=A2t have any thing nice to say then to move on. They =\r\nusually get a bit more\nnasty at this point. But if your positive  they will=\r\n get  the message and leave you alone or move on. This is  just my approach=\r\n. There are many out there\nthat will have some other  approach. And there\nr=\r\neally no right answer, it is what ever work for you. And what your conferra=\r\nble\nwith. And of course your beliefs. I ca only base my opinions on my expe=\r\nriences,\nand what work for me . for example I never do a protection prayer =\r\n before I enter a location, u feel what on the\ninside and what you believe =\r\nmakes you strong. But again this is what works for\nme  personally.shadow   =\r\n  \n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-526530837-1211569183=:13861\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-7\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:12p=\r\nt&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Hey Mick&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Well I have been\ncalled worse.
