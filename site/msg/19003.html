<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>My name is Diane and very new to your group. I have to say I was skeptical about the Frank&#x27;s box but no longer, it has been amazing and for validation I asked them to say my name which they did several times.
 I have had several paranormal experiences all through my life and it led me to do more investigations.  I have several evps from my digital recorder without using Frank&#x27;s box but decided to add a new tool to my equiptment and so far am very pleased with it.
Hugs to all and continue the search for the truth.
Diane</pre>
