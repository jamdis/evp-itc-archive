I know what you mean Misty - it does seem that interpretations are often va=
ried.=A0 I am thinking that the best way to make progress is to get an audi=
o sample that you think is most representative of a given approach's effect=
iveness, and send that privately to several people.=A0 Name the file someth=
ing innocuous (like File1) and don';t tell the people you send it to what y=
ou think you hear.=A0 Also, ask the people not to discuss the file with any=
one else, and have them send what they think they hear directly back to you=
,rather than posting the results in a forum or group.

I think that kind of=
 test is helpful, since it seems to me that once someone tells me what the =
audio clip sounds like, then it's hard for me to hear anything else in it.=
=A0 But,that could be influencing my interpretation (like someone pointing =
to a cloud, telling me its a horse, and then I have trouble NOT seeing a ho=
rse) ,so it's better to listen before it is suggested to me what i should b=
e hearing.

This way, I think the most progress can be made, because if peo=
ple just keep confirming what we think we hear, and it turns out it's just =
noise that we are forcing an interpretation into, we won't be making progre=
ss (though it might make us feel good to believe that we're being successfu=
l).=A0 Getting negative feedback to one's approach is not as fun, and might=
 feel like some non-believer is trying to debunk us.=A0 But, really, that c=
an be the best feedback for progress, since it helps us to change tactics w=
hen our current approach is not effective, rather than continuing down an i=
neffective path, getting accolades from friends, but missing out on other p=
aths that might show more promise,.

I never kno=
