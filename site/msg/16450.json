Yes, anything can be faked. A photo, an\naudio recording, a driver&#39;s license can all be faked. But does that mean\nthat ALL photos, audio recordings and driver&#39;s licenses are fakes? A person\nwho accuses others of misdeeds is often found guilty of the same misdeeds.\nMaybe we&#39;d better have a look at her driver&#39;s license.\n\nI can often hear things in recordings that others can&#39;t. It comes from years\nas a radio amateur trying to hear extremely weak signals in extremely noisy\nbackgrounds. This includes EME (Earth-Moon-Earth) which can be some of the\nmost difficult to hear. I heard things in some recordings I made at a\nhaunted place and sent them to some other people. They couldn&#39;t hear them.\n\nHaving said that, I&#39;m not a fan of &quot;orbs.&quot; I spent a lot of time exploring\nhow to get photos of &quot;orbs&quot; with a digital camera with flash. I&#39;d say 99.9%\nof the orb photos are due to natural causes. There IS that 0.1% I can&#39;t\nexplain, though.\n\nAnyway, Happy New Year to all!\n\nZack\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Dec 31, 2009 at 3:11 AM, Frank Sumption\n&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.bad-language.com/\n&gt;\n&gt;  I was lead to believe this person had an interset in the box, and she\n&gt; brought her &quot;boyfirend&quot; that just happen to be local, to our meeting the\n&gt; other day. I let them &quot;barrow&quot; #63, now  I&#39;m sure she will claim she tested\n&gt; the box &quot;scientifically, and can prove it does not work.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Karen had contacted me via e-mail requesting a meeting. I thought she was\n&gt; someone off the group and has an interest in EVP and the boxes. She did\n&gt; mention she was a skeptic, but I didn&#39;t think debunker, or a professional\n&gt; skeptic--wonder who pays these twits?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  These skeptics don&#39;t allow themselves to hear anything, yet will proclaim\n&gt; that as proof the boxes and EVP don&#39;t work, as if their hearing is somehow\n&gt; better than the average persons ear. If a person doesn&#39;t want to hear it,\n&gt; they won&#39;t, and because they can&#39;&#39;t hear EVP that means no one else an\n&gt; either.  Yeah, real scientific!\n&gt;\n&gt;  Gonna have to remember Google-googel-google!!\n&gt;\n&gt;  Frank-S\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\nThis looks like ano he pe son wi h a huge ego bu lacking in elligence who has a oice o he wo ld o e In e ne ha  she wouldn' ha e had 30 yea s ago.\n \nI ind he a i ude i i a ing.
