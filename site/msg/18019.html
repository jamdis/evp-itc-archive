&gt; Three days left on this first experiment.
&gt;
&gt; For those who say skeptical people won&#x27;t listen to any evidence, here is a
&gt; great way to provide some publicly and prove or disprove that statement.
&gt;
&gt; And if your&#x27;re just the type who maintains an open mind, and would like to
&gt; try to see what works and what doesn&#x27;t, here&#x27;s an opportunity to participate
&gt; in a multi-person test.

&gt; &gt; I have placed a little something on top of my computer monitor, right in
&gt; front of me. It is now 7/10/2010. I will leave it there 4 days, and remove
&gt; it Noon Denver time, on Wednesday, 7/14/2010.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; All you have to do is ask your boxes/spirits/aliens/etc, what it is.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have taken a picture of it, and posted it to the files section here, so
&gt; there is no way I can squirm out of the results:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ.20100710.1.zip
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Please do not try to open the file before noon Wednesday. But feel free
&gt; to download it to your computer beforehand, so you can be sure I won&#x27;t
&gt; change it during, or after, the test.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Answers anyone reveals after noon Wednesday don&#x27;t count. Partial answers
&gt; (like just the color, or shape, or some emotion vibe) don&#x27;t count. Just tell
&gt; me what it is.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Best of Luck. I hope for this to be a regularly occurring experiment, and
&gt; I hope we all can learn from the results.
