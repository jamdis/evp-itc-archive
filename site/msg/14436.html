<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I prefer systems that work right off the bat, the box works, something
talks, and how do I make it better. Just in that attempt there&#x27;s lots of
tail chasing, I don&#x27;t like to get sidetracked on other systems--unless
there&#x27;s already something to suggest it works better. It&#x27;s been my
expereince that all that is needed is something that has human speech
frequencies which can be rearranged in to &quot;thier&quot; voices. Various methods of
providing the raw audio has been proven to work, that&#x27;s why I focus on that
appraoch.  White noise, radio between stations, running water, foreign
language, EVPmaker, and the box, all the same concept.

 Yeah, the thing about all the fake mediums is right, and there&#x27;s no
shortage of people that throw money desperately seeking that shread of proof
that they personally go on. I think that is the bottom line, people are so
absolutely scared of death thay want *any* reassurance. Money is no object.

&gt;  Hellooooo :) Have we all forgotten how &quot;mediums&quot; were popping up
&gt; everywhere back then ;) It was big money. There were always FAKES to be
&gt; found :) Why waste your energy (spirit)on blowing a silly trumpet if you
&gt; could just use your ecto-vocal cords :) to tell ALL. I&#x27;m sure they would
&gt; want to &quot;tell&quot; us where they were, and how they reach us instead of doing
&gt; the AMAZING trumpet playing :) Voicing back then would be expected to have
&gt; these answers...it was easier to draw paying customers with just &quot;tricks&quot;.

&gt; &gt; use a metal trumpet like thing, I have an old banged up one, im going to
&gt; use
&gt; &gt; it today with the RS 125, and see what happens, put it inside the lower
&gt; end
&gt; &gt; of the trumpet, with the mic, near the PC and let them talk away, the PC
&gt; &gt; does the recording, it might help them, who knows until it&#x27;s tried. they
&gt; &gt; use to form cords inside the trumpet out of this substance called
&gt; ectoplasm
&gt; &gt; and talk independently like that one time.

&gt; &gt; try to combine them some how, and see what happens, maybe put some light
&gt; &gt; wires inside the box near where the vibration comes out? Don&#x27;t see how a
&gt; &gt; crystal helps, it&#x27;s just glass, and there is no where for them to create
&gt; &gt; ectoplasm like threads on glass, try two tiny wires, (I see u, stop

&gt; &gt; There was speaking machines back in the 1800s that had mechanical vocal
&gt; &gt; cords. It still seems easiest for them to manipulate the electrical
&gt; signals
&gt; &gt; though.

&gt; &gt; Frank do you think it&#x27;s similar to what was used in 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s by
&gt; &gt; mediums, where a trumpet (long piece of aluminum metal cone light weight
&gt; shaped
&gt; &gt; device) was used, it was a form spirit to form their own vocal cords in
&gt; mid
&gt; &gt; air. Perhaps, you should set up a test, try asking something of the
&gt; &gt; spirit that you do not know, where it could be verified later, that way
&gt; it won&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; have any physical influence. I remember voices easily, it&#x27;s the work I
&gt; &gt; do, so I do recognize my mother&#x27;s voice, I do think you are all onto some
&gt;
&gt; &gt; thing here, which should one day be as the air plane, who every thought
&gt; humans
&gt; &gt; would one day fly? Try some light weight metal object in the box, maybe
&gt; &gt; it would help, maybe shaped like a pair of vocal cords, with folds see it
&gt;
&gt; &gt; that helps. sf

&gt; &gt; I make the boxes and I don&#x27;t know, it seems to be a natural ability that
&gt; &gt; most spirits have. Thoughts can interact with the electronics, and even
&gt; &gt; &quot;voices&quot; of the living can come through, in that way I think we can
&gt; create what
&gt; &gt; we are expecting to hear.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When I first started making this stuff, I gort my wifes &quot;voice&quot; as she
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; stepping in the shower, upstairs, &quot;I&#x27;ll be out in two minutes&quot;, in her
&gt; &gt; voces, throught he box. It&#x27;s seems to be more difficult to conciously
&gt; form
&gt; &gt; voices, kinda like doing PK, it&#x27;s more of a subconcious function. Of
&gt; course
&gt; &gt; that was with the radnom sweep, linear sweep seems to work a little
&gt; &gt; differently, and seems to take more ability, or effort.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The voices seem to made inside the electronics, you can record with no
&gt; &gt; sound output, and still get the same kind of results. Even that could
&gt; support
&gt; &gt; that suggestion that it&#x27;s imagination, in that we&#x27;d still hear the same
&gt; &gt; stuff in the chopped up audio, not that I believe that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Someone needs to study this stuff that hasn&#x27;t already made up their minds
&gt;
&gt; &gt; what it is.

&gt; &gt; spirit get the ability to talk with a box? Are there certain channels
&gt; going
&gt; &gt; by with the box as is like a radio? sf
