<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah Frank, i saw someone challenged me on there.  It&#x27;s pointless to apply for that, they would make the conditions unfavorable to retrieve anything at all.  It&#x27;s all a scam over there, you can&#x27;t prove anything in this field so i think JREF was made for the fun of it.

&gt; &gt; I&#x27;m new here and just chiming in with my two cents....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As a practicing medium I do believe Spirits get stuck.  There is a
&gt; &gt; different energetic feeling I receive when connecting with someone who has
&gt; &gt; truly crossed over and is now &quot;in spirit&quot; versus someone who has not.
&gt; &gt; Those who are stuck either do not realize they have died or they are
&gt; &gt; attached to our Earth plane (be it a particular person or event) and don&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; want to or know how to leave.  I believe it is those stuck individuals who
&gt; &gt; are often behind the rattle &amp; clatter in hauntings---although this topic is
&gt; &gt; still new to me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For those who have actually crossed over (and I believe this is the
&gt; &gt; majority of souls), they return to Spirit and become the light &amp; love they
&gt; &gt; came from.  Spirits have much better things to do than haunt us, they
&gt; &gt; continue to learn and evolve on the other side.  However, they do enjoy
&gt; &gt; communicating with us, especially letting their loved ones know they are ok.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt;  Just like I am skeptical about hauntings, not that I don&#x27;t believe
&gt; &gt;&gt; something is going on, I don&#x27;t think there are stuck spirits, so I think
&gt; &gt;&gt; hauntings are a show for the living.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Wow, Tom...excellent way to sort and define the differences. Do you mind
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; if I quote you on that? Would like to share that thought with some friends I

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; What Frank is referring to is more properly termed a &quot;Pseudo-Skeptic&quot;.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  Indeed Skepticism is a vital part of scientific investigations, but it&#x27;s
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Skepticism based on consideration of the facts and  expressing a caution or
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; difference of opinion is what is useful in the Scientific community.  A
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; pseudo Skeptic is characterized by a person who clearly does not know the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; subject area other than through what may be termed &quot;common knowledge&quot; or, at
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; best, a brief overview of the literature.  A  Pseudo skeptic&#x27;s &quot;opinions&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; are based primarily on an emotional attitude towards the subject matter
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; rather than what few &quot;facts&quot; he knows.  Its a psychological defense he uses
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to shore up his status, the validity of his work, and to cope with things
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that frighten him.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; A real Skeptic is a friend with a difference of opinion based on a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; genuine desire to help and sufficient data on the subject at hand to know
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; what he/she is talking about.  We, as Scientists must always have a health
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; dose of real Skepticism.  Otherwise we risk being the exact inverse of the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Pseudo skeptic---the &quot;FLAKE&quot;.  The Flake is the type who will believe
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; anything.  Just as the Pseudo Skeptic has a need to reject things on
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; emotional grounds, the Flake has a need to accept EVERYTHING on emotional
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; grounds.  Any shadow,  sound, or corner of the eye flash just HAS to be a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ghost or spirit. ----or whatever.  I think you know the type, and   these
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;flakes&quot; are what Pseudo skeptics accuse us who are serious about paranormal
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; studies  of being.  Perhaps its one of the reasons they get us so angry.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   I&#x27;ve heard the same said for the evp researchers!  But it&#x27;s not that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; simple in either case:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the last block that you reference has small print that says &quot;Compare the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; hypothesis to the experiment&#x27;s conclusion&quot;.  Which of course you can&#x27;t do
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; unless you already visited the hypothesis block and have a hypothesis to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; which to compare.  That in turn has small print which says &quot;predict the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; outcome of the problem&quot;, which of course you can&#x27;t do either unless you&#x27;ve
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; already visited the earlier block of Purpose (&quot;state the problem&quot;).
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s helpful to deny good evidence, whether it is good
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; evidence from someone claiming to have detected spirits, or whether it is
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; good evidence from someone claiming that people can mistake noise for speech
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; or random radio tunings for spirit control.  That&#x27;s why the scientific
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; method is valuable: it keeps both the skeptic and the believer real.
