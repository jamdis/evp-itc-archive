<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Just as with EVP&#x27;s I get a sort of &quot;feeling&quot; with these...and this sort 
of voice recording is new to me. TAPS said my series of photos 
were &quot;BUGS&quot;...I saved the e-mail for any one interested...sigh...I am 
guessing they only have time to look at one or two photos...I have an 
entire sries...of differing dates. 
The pics that bother me are the upside down naked spirit I 
call &quot;Pinkie&quot;...I seriously need someone to tell me why she is naked 
and upside down.
Anyway...all of these photos are taken by me...most in my yard and all 
from the same camera.
Lots of Orbs. 
I am at a loss...
Just to let everyone know...I started on these pics when I decided to 
take art pictures of cigarette smoke...at first I saw LOTS of weird 
stuff...and then, I actually found anomallies.

Try this...if it doesn&#x27;t work...I will try another way to the album.
