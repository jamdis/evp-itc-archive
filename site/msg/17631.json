Last summer when the young lady tech student got\n&gt; killed, she was the young Chinese girl that was going to be married that\n&gt; week she just disappeared, it was the spirit people from the box that\n&gt; reported to me that she had been killed, the first day she came up as only\n&gt; missing, I called it in and the cop heard it, and hoped it was only people\n&gt; talking about it over the radio, he didn&#39;t understand, but the spirit gave\n&gt; the name of the guy that killed her, and where they would find her body, and\n&gt; sure enough it was all true.  If that was not test enough, I don&#39;t know what\n&gt; else, yes, I do have all those files intact here on my pc.

Science has been wrong many times before.  But, it\n&gt;&gt; is always self correcting.  Not because of ego, but because of the very\n&gt;&gt; reason you are mad at it.  It is an unrelenting, cold-hearted swamp bitch!\n&gt;&gt; LOL   Science is not a thing that cares about what you want or think you\n&gt;&gt; hear.  It cares about verifiable, commendable and repeatable evidence.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The problem you are having, well other than not getting the Theorize shots\n&gt;&gt; on time LOL  Might be, the about lack of logic in the theory to begin with.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What you are doing is going from point (A) to point (C)  And never taking\n&gt;&gt; a real hard look at point (B)  Now, you are an electrician guy.

How do you know they are taking to\n&gt;&gt; you?  You do understand the nature of the human mind and how it works?  Do\n&gt;&gt; you understand that this information is nothing new and it dates back to the\n&gt;&gt; year 1956? (I am thinking)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; How do you get past point (B)?  Do you except it on faith?  That is a\n&gt;&gt; Religion.

It says one of the reasons they do not consider the current\n&gt;&gt;&gt; radio-sweep claims reliable, is that those making those claims do not do\n&gt;&gt;&gt; double blind tests.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; So if you are calling BS and clueless those who are not doing double\n&gt;&gt;&gt; blind testing, that begs the question - are you?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- On *Wed, 6/9/10, Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@ gmail.com&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;* wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@ gmail.com&lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: Same stupid nasty negative BS!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com &lt;EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Date: Wednesday, June 9, 2010, 12:52 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   It&#39;s probably not kosher to post this, but I find this highly\n&gt;&gt;&gt; insulting to all of us. As usual, ignore all facts and all other methods,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; such as EVPmaker, which forms all the voices inside the computer. Ignore all\n&gt;&gt;&gt; phone EVP messages, ignore all voices heard with no electronic aids. Ignore\n&gt;&gt;&gt; messages received via turned off TV and printers--and on and on, yet they\n&gt;&gt;&gt; know all about EVP..Ignore the fact that probably thousands use boxes\n&gt;&gt;&gt; successfully.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;We have conducted a few listening studies of reported radio-sweep EVP\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and the results have not been good. We have also worked with a variety of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; such devices. Based on what we know about trans-etheric influences, how EVP\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and visual forms of ITC are formed and what we know about mediumship, it is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult to fit radio-sweep into any established hypothesis. Without solid\n&gt;&gt;&gt; research supporting it as producing EVP, it is impossible for us to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; recommend it or support its use. If there were double-blind studies\n&gt;&gt;&gt; conducted by experienced researchers that shows it does produce phenomena,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; we would gladly promote it as an alternative technique.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; We are pretty sure that, in transform EVP (ordinary recorder), the voice\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is formed in the electronics by transforming available audio-frequency noise\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in an active part of the electronics such as a transistor junction. We think\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the process is amplification of a weak telekinetic signal via stochastic\n&gt;&gt;&gt; resonance and we have found that the optimum audio-frequency signal for this\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is a chaotic one rich in voice-frequencies with many transient perturbation.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; That is our working hypothesis. &quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  I can&#39;t say who this is from, cuz almost certain I&#39;d get sued. There&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;&gt; no double blind testing their BS either.

I love these so called\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experts that tell us that we can only make contact using their exact methods\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and we need to refrain from any other way of doing research because in their\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eyes were just spinning our wheels. So we can&#39;t get communication from\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; modified radios and were all just hearing what we want I guess.
