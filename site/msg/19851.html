<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi 

Thank you for getting back to me. I thought I had destroyed the group by accident.  Awful feeling!  

I completely understand and am very grateful that he started this group and is willing to share and let share ideas and files. God forbid he should leave!!   I&#x27;m not used to looking at video this way so it would be easy for me to miss a lot.  I did see the Upside Down Lincoln and the face at the end in the second attachment of &quot;If this is the only one...&quot;  I need more practice and a more open mind, I think.  This is all so far reaching.  Thank goodness he, especially (and the others in this group) are doing this and sharing these ideas.  Kudos to Frank for all of his work!

&gt; I&#x27;m glad you took another look..hey listen we all are learning here..that message was not solely to you..I never saw you try to correct anyone on what they where hearing but some on here does ALOT...its starting to sound as if they feel like they knew more then anyone and most just started doing this where..Frank,Steve and some other have been doing this for years..Some even have the nerve to try to talk done to Frank..now remember this is the man the made the box..so i just think its insulting and ignorant. I for one will be really pissed of if they ran him from his own group..

&gt; Dear Ursula,
&gt; 
&gt; Yes I did and I saw it. This is new to me and I&#x27;m here to learn so I think I&#x27;ll just take it all in for a while and not butt in to what I don&#x27;t understand yet, sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for making me go back and look again.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#x27;m thinking there is faces embedded in sound, it&#x27;s related to speech, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; not just EVP. It seems to be a normal function of our own minds(living or
&gt; &gt; &gt; dead), the same as reverse speech. I found some faces in old EVPs from boxes
&gt; &gt; &gt; and also in music files. The ones from Evanescence are pretty impressive in
&gt; &gt; &gt; person, and do not seem to be intentionaly embedded.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I know, it&#x27;s not ghost hunters, and most don&#x27;t want to have to think.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think most want this stuff in a neat little box, all well defined, all
&gt; &gt; &gt; rules and protocols known, but it just won&#x27;t stay in one box, or universe
&gt; &gt; &gt; for that matter.

&gt; &gt; Dear Frank,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think that I see what you mean. I mean no offense, but I it would be helpful to see something a little more definitive that couldn&#x27;t be mistaken for matrixing. Is this possible? Is it just me?
