We&#x27;ll do a little test, see if anyone else the world hears what I do.

&gt;   My two cents then:  it depends on the purpose of the announcement how
&gt; best to go about the experiment.  If the purpose is to confirm to yourself
&gt; or others that this was a valid prediction, or be able to make a case for
&gt; there being something to this ITC stuff, or to have a prediction you can
&gt; wave in the face of them darned skepdicks, then specifics have to be
&gt; presented before the event.
&gt;
&gt; If the purpose is not to do any of those things, but just try to see for
&gt; yourself &#x27;what works&#x27;, then it doesn&#x27;t much matter whether you give details
&gt; after the event, or even bothering announcing the event at all.
&gt;
&gt; So the only confusing part is why announce the event at all, if no details
&gt; are given before it takes place?  Besides, if the details might help save
&gt; someone from harm, it would be really a bad thing to do to keep them to
&gt; yourself, wouldn&#x27;t it?
&gt;
&gt; Personally, if I thought I was getting predictions of future events that
&gt; might cause harm to someone, I&#x27;d be posting those details far and wide, in
&gt; the hope of helping who I can.  Not doing that... well, I just hope the
&gt; person doesn&#x27;t believe in karma.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Well, here&#x27;s my two cents:
&gt;
&gt; If we want to rule out as much &quot;observer&quot; interference -- whether PK or
&gt; whatever -- the fewer details we know, the better.
&gt;
&gt; So, I&#x27;m happy with a date, period. I trust Frank&#x27;s integrity to tell me if
&gt; the event (if any happens) is a reasonable match, or not.
&gt;
&gt; I&#x27;d rather stumble onto the event on my own, than be accused of trying to
&gt; mold the event -- or selectively focus on just certain aspects of it -- to
&gt; fit criteria known ahead of time.
&gt;
&gt; That&#x27;s why I like things like the PEAR project (aka Global Consciousness
&gt; Project); it&#x27;s just numbers. If and how it correlates... that&#x27;s what gets
&gt; interesting.
&gt;
&gt; Cheerfully,
&gt; Fiona

&gt; &gt; Well, I was going to try to objectively compare your statements to
&gt; anything that might happen on Thursday.Â  Why get so defensive over that?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And why not just post the full details?Â  It&#x27;s not really a prediction if
&gt; you post the details after the fact.Â  Something a little better than
&gt; &quot;Wait... Navy&quot;, which says nothing really.
