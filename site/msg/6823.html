Its just friends returning the favor. Kind of like politics, "you get me this show and I will put you on it". LOL  These people have lost sight of what its all about. I have never had a  TV show offer but I have had many offers for interviews on network shows, newspapers, books and so on and have turned down everyone. I have no desire to be in the limelight and actually prefer to be behind the scenes, mostly because I know how these shows and the media can twist your information to fit the theme of their show. Everyone of them that wanted to use my video or audio wanted full control over it. I told them no, you can use it for the show but it remains mine. They didn't like that either!

Regards,

Frank R.

Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: Paranormal State!?










  


    
            I just got to add to FS' point with respect to Paranormal State.  



Anyone notice Ron Milione (TAPS gadget electronics expert) appeared 

on Paranormal State as now a "demon expert," identifying an EVP on 

the show as a "demon" by the sound of its voice on the recording?



Then I saw Ron on the History Channel's UFO Hunters as a UFO 

researcher/expert.  I'm trying to keep count, but that makes him a 

electronics guru, UFO expert and demonologist!  Nice guy, but I think 

he just has a great agent that can get him these "roles."  



Also, I saw a lady have her home investigated by the Penn State bunch 

on Paranormal State and supposedly in need of their help, then I turn 

the channel and see her as a paranormal investigator on Ghost Hunters 

International!  She must have a great agent, too.  ;)

people involved, and you can tell they are actors, with speech

too well rehearshed and scripted for me to watch any more of it.
