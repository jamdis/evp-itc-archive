Do you speak French Steve?  A woman was speaking it during the clip starting
at .41 seconds.  Are there any French radio stations down that way?  What I
find interesting is that she is speaking French and man is agreeing with her
in English.  It may be radio broadcast because of the clarity, but I would
think a translator would be speaking for her since only the Bayou and Quebec
use French here in North America.

My French is really rusty, but I think she is saying:

&quot;D&#x27;accord.  En vous etait parlons a l&#x27;etre (yes)  te t&#x27;aller....&quot; and I
can&#x27;t quite make out the rest.

&quot;I agree.  What you are talking about is the being (yes).  You go....&quot;

When you switch to direct mode random at 4:13 you get a pretty clear female
&quot;hey.&quot;

Looks like the camera was well worth the money!
