Experiment 2

On Friday, 7/16/2010 I placed an  object on t=
op of my computer monitor, 
right in front of  me, and will leave it there =
until noon Denver time on  
Monday, 7/19/2010. This experiment asks for par=
ticipants  to determine what that 
object is. Vague or partial answers  won=
't be counted (for example, just 
giving a color, shape,  size, what it's m=
ade of, etc): we're looking for what 
it  is. Answers anyone reveals after =
noon Monday won't count.  Participants 
can use their ghost boxes, EVP reco=
rders, or  any other means they chose. At 
the end of the experiment,  I wi=
ll reveal the object, and a tally of the 
number of  correct and/or incorre=
ct answers.

In order to keep  me honest, I have taken a picture of the obj=
ect at the  
start of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section  (R=
J folder) of 
this group. The idea with this file is that  you can download=
 it now and 'keep 
it safe' on your  computer. Then at the end of the exper=
iment, I will post  
the password so you can reveal the contents of the fil=
e.  That way, you 
were in control of the original image during  the entire=
 test, not me. If you 
can follow the link, it is  here:

Windows users: _h=

/RJ20100716.mac.zip) 

And if you do not care to download the  zip file now=
, I will post the final 
image there at the end  of the experiment anyway.

My monitor is one of the  older box-like SONY CRTs, and says "Trinitron"

and  "Multiscan 200sf" on the upper front. I have a couple  monitors stacke=
