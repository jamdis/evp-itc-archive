Most do go on SF. But some may be confused, or they can't get passed their =
sadness, or pain, or whatever else that anchors them to a spot.

Just like =
when living people hold grudges-they can't get past that hurt. So they wall=
ow in it, constantly "living" it. If they could learn to just let it go, th=
ey would be able to move on.

This is why it is so important when you are s=
till alive to get over any issues you had in the past, any wrongs, etc. It =
is also important to not get obsessed with material objects, such as a hous=
e or other possession. In essence, by becoming obsessed, you are anchoring =
your soul to that object, whether it be tangible object, or an emotion. It =
seems that it is much harder to free your self of such bindings after death=
.

  It's amazing how these people that die, stay a=
round in the same place they died, one would think they would be free of th=
e sick physical body, go exploring, or look for loved ones, why do they wan=
t to hang around an empty old building?
