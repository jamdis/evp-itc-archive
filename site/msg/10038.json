You don&#39;t know shit about me and what I do or my financial situation with charity.  \n   \n  #2  I ask you to hold on to the Mini-Box, and you told me it wasn&#39;t going anywhere.  I got back on Sunday(with the cash to buy it), and I already saw where you where trying to sell it on the forums, and ebay.  So I said fuck it.\n   \n  #3  Do you really that people believe you made a mistake on setting the reserve, and pricing the Mini Box higher on ebay than what you could buy a knew one.  I&#39;ve had many people email telling me the same thing.\n   \n  #4 You never offered me a speaker in the deal.\n   \n  #5 The amount of $400.00 to $450.00 you can buy a new Mini-box.  Example(If you go and buy a Car, and drive it off the lot it automatically looses value, just like if you buy something that is used should cost less than what you paid for a brand new one with a 2 year warranty.  Dude its used\n\n  #6  Personally I don&#39;t give a shit about what you sell on ebay, but don&#39;t try do advertise on a forum about what your selling on ebay, if you don&#39;t want your ebay business on the forum.\n   \n  I am sick of this dumb ass pity shit,  If you have anything to say to me if should be taken care off in a private email.\n\n  Peace Out!\n   \n  P.S.\n  To the mods, and Frank I will never post a message like this again on the forum... But I will not let anybody run over me or anybody else.  I&#39;m sorry for any disrespect I may have cause for anybody else.
