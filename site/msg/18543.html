I don't think I have enough data yet to make any conclusions, so I plan mor=
e experiments.=C2=A0 Since there are different distinct claims about what t=
he box or the recorders can do, I try to make different distinct experiment=
s for each.

Some people claim they can get the box to tell them things tha=
t the operator couldn't know, so my "whats the object" experiment is one wa=
y to examine that.=C2=A0 Some people claim the boxes can make predictions, =
so cataloging predictions and examining the results can help examine that.=
=C2=A0 If there are other claims, I will try to figure experiments based on=
 those.
