<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I have a Trifield Natural EMF Meter. Cool instrument. I used it on an
investigation last summer and didn&#x27;t get any sort of unusual readings. I&#x27;m
participating in another one this Saturday night and the place appears to be
very haunted. I&#x27;ll let you know if I get any readings with it.

The little $10 &quot;point and shoot&quot; thermometers they sell at Harbor Freight
are a good deal, too. But the one I have appears to eat batteries.

&gt; We have thermometers too, just didn&#x27;t mention them. I will grab a compass
&gt; and some motion detectors. Must say I didn&#x27;t even think of grabbing a
&gt; hygrometer but will definitely look into it. The trifield meter is a bit out
&gt; of budget right now but we are going to get one here soon. And yes we do
&gt; have a K2 meter already. We have most everything I could think of, just
&gt; looking for some oddities. One of the things I found a while ago was a
&gt; homemade battery detector. Basically it was 4 batteries running 2 led&#x27;s that
&gt; somebody had made. It was used to correlate the draining of equipment
&gt; batteries. Wish I could find it again. That&#x27;s the type of stuff I&#x27;m looking
&gt; for, stuff that someone made that helped them out.

&gt; &gt; Dont forget thermometers to check for &quot;cold spots&quot;---Are the spots
&gt; actually &quot;Cold&quot; or are they making us FEEL cold?
&gt; &gt; Also a compass for magnetic fluctuations.
&gt; &gt; Some of those ultrasonic or IR motion detectors (real cheap at radio
&gt; shack)
&gt; &gt; A hygrometer for measuring dewpoint( at what temp water in air will
&gt; condense to form a mist---great for correlating with cold spots---mist
&gt; apparations)
&gt; &gt; A K2 meter--only 50 bucks or so. great for &quot;gross screening&quot; of the area
&gt; &gt; A natural EM trifield meter a bit expensive($200-250) but standard ghost
&gt; hunting equipment.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I love this discussion group. There is so much information here it is
&gt; hard to process all of it. Currently, I am working on building a Frank&#x27;s box
&gt; for my paranormal group, however, I am looking for some other home made type
&gt; equipment to have for our investigation this next week. We currently have IR
&gt; cameras, EMF detectors, tons of audio recorders and many different cameras.
&gt; Is there anything else we should have or be using that anyone can think of??
