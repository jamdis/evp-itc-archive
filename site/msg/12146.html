Zack,
 
I can attest to the opposite regarding the Ovilus 1.  The last time I  used 
mine it gave me full statements.  It was referring to contact someone  and 
labelled them by name and told me why.  then why I did contact that  person I knew 
why I was suppose to contact them.  And that person was all  the way across 
the country.
The unit does work when it is given sufficient time to set up.
 
Jeff

I haven't treid one of those things yet, but based on the theoy of it I  
suspect it is much morelikely to generate "words" from randomities and  
things that weren't in fact words. It wouldn't be considered reliable  
evidence by any serious researchers.
