I was 17. She was 15. She had had her second kidney transplant a few months earlier and died of gas gangrene.\n   \n  She died at 3:15 PM and I felt it. I knew that she had died. It is very difficult to explain, but I knew that she was gone. So, it wasn&#39;t surprising to me when I got home from school and my eldest sister was on the phone telling my Mother that Rena had died.\n   \n  My Mother had moved us to Texas from Oklahoma a few months earlier. I knew that Rena wasn&#39;t doing good as she was before I left, but no one expected her to die. She made a turn for the worse late that morning and by 3:15 she was gone. \n   \n  Late that afternoon I took the Greyhound bus back to my hometown in Oklahoma. When I got to my sisters house, it was around 1 am. My sister is 18 years older than me, so I have a niece that is a year younger than me. My niece and I both heard Rena call my name and I then heard her call my name again a little later before I went to bed. That night after I had gone to sleep, it woke me up as I felt someone sit on the side of my bed. I knew it was Rena telling me she was okay, but this was before I knew anything about the paranormal, so I was a bit scared to open my eyes and see her. \n   \n  She was my first love and I am hoping that I will hear from her someday via EVP/ITC.\n   \n  I consider myself very blessed to of heard her call my name and sit beside me to let me know she was okay. \n   \n  Wishing everyone a wonderful weekend.\n   \n  Jeremy \n  New York, New York \n  \n\n                           \n\n __________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
