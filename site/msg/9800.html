<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I believe an investigator who honestly means no harm to anyone or anything 
while on an investigation will not be harmed or even threatened. I have 
been in cemeteries where I felt &quot;watched&quot; by something and possibly felt
threatened a bit. If I do something like straighten or right a fallen 
tombstone, I&#x27;ve noticed the threatened feeling to disappear.

It&#x27;s as if that simple action convinced someone that you are OK.
