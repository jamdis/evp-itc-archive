Hello Frank. Ive been in your group I know for atleast 2 years. I said befo=
re that although I dont often, if at all post anything, I do read every one=
 of them that go to my inbox. I just wanted to say that although I love ele=
ctronics and I have a degree in electronics, I never knew anything about Th=
e Box until I saw it on TV. As far as I know, it was the first time the dev=
ice was ever mentioned in the mainstream and yes it was called "Frank's Box=
" That in it's self should be respected for no matter who did what first, i=
t was important enough to be given your name and on national television. I =
have been intrigued ever since and=A0 these posts that I've read since my f=
irst time requesting to be in your group ha fallen into line with the major=
ity of my feelings on the "paranormal" (such a cliche' anymore is it not?) =
I tip my hat to you sir for your contributations and I care nothing for the=
 naysayer.
