<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi Bruce.  My link is www.ITCdeadpeople.com

I saw your VPI work.  The images were very cool.  I don&#x27;t have photoshop, although I did 
take note of your process somewhere in case I ever get it.  I saw it on another person&#x27;s site 
as well, so I never was sure if you had copied that person&#x27;s technique, or they had copied 
yours.  All I remember thinking is, boy, that&#x27;s a whole lot of steps to go through to get to 
the final impressive images, and I wondered what made whichever one of you came up 
with it, think to try all those steps.  

I do remember that cat!  As well as some other really clear images.  :-)

&gt; Margaret,
&gt; 
&gt; Before I became engrossed in box research I had done tons of research 
&gt; with every method of ITC imaging.
&gt; 
&gt; I did Video Loop, water reflection, crystal, mirror, you name it.
&gt; And got pretty good results from most.
&gt; 
&gt; My most astounding visual itc came from a dicovery in my home.
&gt; I have a crystal window in the front door of my house facing west, 
&gt; when the sun starts to go down it shines through this crystal window 
&gt; and projects onto the walls in my family room.
&gt; 
&gt; I was sitting watching tv one day and happenned to look over at 
&gt; something that caught my attention, when I looked over there was a 
&gt; face looking back. I ran to get my digital camera and that started a 
&gt; year long process of experiments and spirit images I name VPI (visual 
&gt; projection imaging) I have literally hundreds of detailed images of 
&gt; spirits that where reflected through the crystal onto the walls in my 
&gt; home. as far as I can discern the spirits were forming the images 
&gt; inside of the crystal window, and the sun was acting as sort of a 
&gt; slide or movie projecter. Projecting their images onto the walls when 
&gt; it came through the window.
&gt; 
&gt; I had a page on I am haunted for the longest time, and drew quite a 
&gt; following for my images. Alas since I discovered box research I have 
&gt; not done one imaging session.
&gt; 
&gt; What got my attention was the mention of the horse image. I also 
&gt; captured the image of a horse, very detailed and a cat that you would 
&gt; think was sitting right in the room.
&gt; 
&gt; Maragaret, please post the link to your site I did not get it and I 
&gt; would love to take a look.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone is interested let me know and I&#x27;ll post some of my images.
&gt; 
&gt; Bruce
