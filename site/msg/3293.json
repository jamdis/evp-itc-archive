Your thoughts help a lot.  I have also heard that an EVP &quot;develops&quot; with listening--that the quality actually improves the more you listen (well, until the tape starts to go bad LOL!)  What do you guys think of this?  \n  I really, really like the idea of telling the entities to speak more clearly!  I have already found myself doing that--&quot;come on, nice and loud for me&quot;--I feel like a Kindergarten teacher!\n\nFrank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:\n           Translating, or interpreting?
