I brought Chip Coffey up to show him #34, and wihtout asking \nquestions, the box told Chip, &quot;you have to have this!&quot;.\n\n I&#39;ll ask questions, but it&#39;s rare, I prefer to just let them speak. \n\n I was just trying to impress people that they know who you are, when \nyou&#39;re recording, and what you&#39;re thinking--there&#39;s no limits.\n\n Frank-S"}
