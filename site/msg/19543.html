Hi guys.

As some of you know, I w=
ork with the inimitable Stacey Jones in a
ghost hunting group called Centra=
l New York Ghost Hunters. We have a
TV show that plays throughout Central N=
Y (accessible to over 1.5
million viewers total) called CNY Spirits.

In th=
is episode, which has been uploaded to youtube, you can see the
Minibox Plu=
s on an investigation. It was used in tandem with a poker
game and garnered=
 some amazing results. The Minibox was used in part
2, and everyones favori=
te shack hack was used in part 3. To my
knowledge, this is the first time a=
 Minibox has been used on
television. You will have to ignore what Stacey s=
ays about the
Minibox because she was dead wrong on most of her facts. I wi=
sh that
the producer had interviewed me so I could have explained it a hell=
uva
lot better.

If you are wondering, I am the goofy looking guy with the =
pony tail and tattoos.

You can check out pt 1 here:

http://www.youtube.co=
m/watch?v=3Danxfj8Dlrus&feature=3Drelated

This episode was a followup inve=
stigation to a prior one done about 6
weeks earlier. This earlier investiga=
tion yielded some amazing EVP's
and flashlight responses. YOu can view pt 1=
 here:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DEy6uHks4aj4&feature=3Drelated

The=
se are some of the clips from that session.

The clip about "pissing me off=
" has become pretty famous because
Stacey uses it when she lectures at conf=
erences. It is very
intriguing because it is her voice coming through the H=
ack while she
is sitting at the table. I have discussed this clip with a fe=
w of
you, and here it is a lot cleaner than in the video.

The rest of the =
clips are from the poker session that were not in the
video. On the "Holdin=
g a Five" clip, Mike actually had a pair of
fives in his hand.
