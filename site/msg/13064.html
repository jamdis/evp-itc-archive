<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>No, that is quite incorrect. I do not question motives or accuse of
dishonesty.  I simply suggest ways to improve the objectivity and
accuracy of the testing.  I am still at a loss as to why you don&#x27;t
find that valuable.

&gt; Again. You assume prejudice. You question the motives of the honest
people
&gt; in this group.Those doing the research need all the information
possible to
&gt; give them a clearer picture as to what to look and listen for. This
isn&#x27;t a
&gt; Sham like the Million Dollar Challenge.

&gt; &gt;   My purpose was to discuss the testing protocol, to make it as
&gt; &gt; objective as possible, and to minimize possible prejudice. The
&gt; &gt; problem, is that there could be a predisposition to hear what someone
&gt; &gt; has already described: it is only a possibility, not a certainty.
&gt; &gt; But, since it is possible to minimize this issue with a change in the
&gt; &gt; test, I recommended that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe I would better understand your issue if you told me where my
&gt; &gt; suggestions would not add value and objectivity to the test. I am
&gt; &gt; happy to learn from the group and work out even better testing
&gt; &gt; protocols by discussion and feedback.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Prejudice refers to prejudgment. So, in this case, prejudice
&gt; &gt; meant to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already be ready to hear what someone already described,
rather than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; listening before you have that information, and so can
maximize your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; objectivity.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe you could clarify what you meant by my viewpoint? I didn&#x27;t
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand the comment.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To insure this testing is objective, wouldn&#x27;t it have been
&gt; &gt; best not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to inform everyone what kind of disaster these items were
&gt; &gt; from? Now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that everyone knows they are from a plane crash, that will set
&gt; &gt; up the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prejudice of hearing plane/travel related words in the evp
noises.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And as you probably know, once that prejudice is active, once
&gt; &gt; I say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Doesn&#x27;t that sound like someone saying
&gt; &gt; &quot;Sssssstewardesssss...&quot;, then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone hears THAT word, rather than just noise, or, for
example
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Stewed ass&quot;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And, if something does sound like a plane/travel related
word, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will now be highlighted as an example of why this was a
successful
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test, and the other less-relevant words ignored. This is a
form of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confirmation bias, which again, hurts the value of the test.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A more objective way would have been to send out both crash
&gt; &gt; related
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; items, and completely innocuous items, with no explanation of
&gt; &gt; where
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each was from, and see what kind of EVPs were returned on
each.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Further, the returned EVPs should then be returned to
someone to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evaluate who ALSO doesn&#x27;t know the origin of the objects,
so that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they do not torture the interpretations into the forms you
&gt; &gt; hope and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expect them to be (again, plane/travel related). While this
&gt; &gt; test of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course lacks all kinds of controls, this would at least be a
&gt; &gt; start to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defining a double-blind test, which is the gold standard
for good
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; research in this kind of research.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even though you have tried to keep some of the information
quiet,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is still quite a large opportunity for guessing and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coincidence. For example, one person might assume this was
from an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; airshow (since, as you said, the event was very fast, and many
&gt; &gt; people
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saw it), and so only send in EVPs that would be relevant
to that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation (I.e. Not sending in child-like sounds, or
sending in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sounds that sound like scratchy tower or inter-plane
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication). If the crash was a commercial airline,
then dozens
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of different people could have been killed, which means
you could
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find SOME relevancy no matter what noises are returned to you:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practical any word, name, or sound will support some
&gt; &gt; speculation that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it could have been relevant to one of those people.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do think it is a good idea to test your theories. But my
purpose
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here is to suggest ways to help these tests be as objective as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible, and for your efforts and testing to be as worth
while as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible, and for the youtube video results you make to be as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; valuable and bulletproof as possible. But I am concerned
that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; above scenario is full of opportunity for subjectivity and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misinterpretation.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
