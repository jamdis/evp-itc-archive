Yeah it was pretty loud but I could still hear the replies. That is probably why I heard what I did but I wasnt going to say the buzzing sucks when I could hear most of it. LOL besides I heard the F word so I think that says enough.

  Hi Craig;

That buzzing is awful! I can't hear much beyond that. If anyone can, have a 
tech check the power supply voltages at the board, there should be plus and 
minus 12 volts for the RVG, and pus 12 for the audio/tuner section. Look at 
it with a scope, maybe there a bad regulator, or bad power switch section. 
The way it is, that box is about useless.
