<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>A great show is scheduled for Sunday, Mark and Debbie Constantino will be our
guests. You have probably seen them on several shows including Ghost
Adventures, Paranormal State....just to name a couple.

They are EVP specialists in the field and should be a great show to check out,
so i hope you do.

Here is their site:
