Hi All

I have to admit that I share the same opinion as Bruce. I d=
ont what everyones take is on this but I felt that some of moon and even Fr=
anks attitude was slightly arrogant. I am a researcher in the UK using old =
reel to reel methods and obtaining excellent results. I lost some family an=
d some close friends=A05 yeara ago=A0and suddenly it dawned on me...what is=
 life all about. I went on to research every evp pioneer i could, listen to=
 hours/days of recordings and it changed my outlook on life. tears were tur=
ned to smiles and then I realised what all this research is for. it was a b=
ig step for me spiritually. 

I dont know if there is anyone else on here u=
sing old fashioned methods but if anybody would like to hear recordings ple=
ase ask. I am using a reel to reel sony "Hi frequency" recorder and trying =
various types of tones, backgrounds e.t.c.

Good luck to everyone with thei=
r research, you are right we are changing history we are discovering new th=
ings. if it wasnt for individuals such as raudive, jurghenson to name a few=
, maybe we wouldnt have discovered this. it takes a brave individual to tac=
kle an arrogant human race blunted with science.

Kind Regards

The quiet o=
ne :-)

Sorry to burden you with this nons=

Here is a copy of my final personal e-mail to Frank Sumption which by t=

I want you to read it first hand so there are no chance=

Frank,

This is getting ridiculous now, you should stop writing these post=
s, all you are doing is making yourself look ridiculous.

I have offered ma=
ny times to make my raw recordings available for review by anyone who wants=
 them. I have made the same challenge to your friend moon who we all know i=
s behind this tirade he has time and again refused or ignored the request f=
or any type of audio file
to be publicly posted for revue and continues to =
take advantage of innocent unsuspecting people with his con game and chargi=
ng large amounts of money for sessions where he fabricates and makes up con=
tent as he goes along.

I was the only one to confront him in public and ex=
pose him for the fake he is and this is his feeble attempt at retaliation. =
I and other researchers like me have brought this research light years from=
 where it was when you and I first met, moon just continues to use it to ri=
p people off and has not contributed a thing to the research of ghost box c=
ommunication beside lining his own pockets. 

Just the fact that he has you=
 doing his dirty work shows the type of guy he is. I can remember a time wh=
en you publicly came out against any type of money making using your boxes =
and even refused moon when he wanted to manufacture and sell them for large=
 profits yet now you condone his robbery of innocent unaware people and act=
ually act foolish on his behest.

Frank you are better than this, just conc=
entrate on developing a better box and forget about moon and his tricks and=
 lies, he is finished in the paranormal and he knows it, everyone is wise t=
o his game and he is practically an outcast.

Frank you are hitching you wa=
gon to a dead horse. Get away from these bad influences before they ruin yo=
ur reputation as well.

We have had this moon discussion in the past and on=
ce he has exhausted his need for you he will screw you again like he has do=
ne so many times before.

Frank, I like and respect you and I hope you will=
 consider what I have said in this e-mail and I sincerely hope you post thi=
s one on the evp-itc group. I will be posting it on my group and others I b=
elong to.

Your former friend
Bruce
