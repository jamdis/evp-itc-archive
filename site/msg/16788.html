<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Angelina,

I am new here too and I am glad that I can contribute to you question.
To do a shack hack on your own is pretty simple.  Steve has put up a page that describes the process quite easily (the 12-587 is the current shack model).  Whatever you do, don&#x27;t confuse this with one of Frank&#x27;s boxes though, they are completely different animals that are not comparable.

As for the quality of digital recorders, well, you get what you pay for.  I have three recorders and I currently receiving the best quality on my Sony.  I am very eager to try out the new Tascam recorder and will buy it soon.  As for the &quot;spinning&quot; sound you got, I would double check the voice in your headphones and see if it actually pans left and right across the stereo spectrum, or if it moves up and down or back and forth.  If none of this is occurring, then it may just be the quality of your recorder or the strength of whomever is communicating and not a &quot;spinning&quot; effect.  

But, if any of the effects I listed above happen, then this may be a case of frequencies dropping out and reappearing which can easily be confirmed in a good editing program like Audition.  It is quite common for an EVP to have a hollow sound because of missing frequencies and you may be interpreting this as &quot;spinning.&quot;

&gt; I&#x27;ve had a lot of success using a digital tape recorder to get EVP in my home. I am interested in creating a Franks Box from the radio shack radio. (I&#x27;m not mechanically inclined) I apologize but I couldn&#x27;t find the directions anywhere. Can someone point me in the right direction to create my own ghost box? 
&gt; I am also interested in the quality of sound some of you may have gotten with digital tape recorder EVPs.  I got one that happened when I left the recorder in my living room and left. It sounded like the voice was spinning around the room (kind of like Carol Ann in Poltergiest) and it said &quot;Door is open&quot;  Is it odd to hear a voice that sounds like it is spinning as it speaks?
&gt; Thanks &#x27;
