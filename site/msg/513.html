          Apparently we still have one or more Grass Harp duffus spies here 
reporting back everyword to their hypocite leader. Guess they have to 
sneak onto other groups cuz they can't get their own voices, and 
spirit contacts. Needless to say, I'm still getting hate mail from 
these vile little minds. I might have to start screening new members.
