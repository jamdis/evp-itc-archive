<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Here are links to research referred to in my original post. Also,
check the book I mentioned for the alternative suggestion that emf
field exposure can induce actual psychic experiences as opposed to a
perceived experience, not an actual one.

Both links are to researchers that have worked together in the past.

&gt; Hi Bill,
&gt; 
&gt; Can you give me a reference to these studies I would be very
interested in reading them? I have always heard and read articles
suggesting that low compression (ELF/VLF) waves in the 5Hz to 40Hz
range caused physiological responses and not the magnetic fields.
These frequencies resonate and produce secondary harmonics that can
cause changes in behavior as well. Such as aggression, euphoria,
jumpiness, depression and so on. 
&gt; 
&gt; There is an altered state of consciousness that will give a person
the feeling of invisible presences and a heightened sense of paranoia,
its called the Hypnogogic state and it is usually associated with
sleep paralysis or the &quot;old hag syndrome&quot;. It can be reached from a
point of total relaxation or a type of trance state.
&gt; 
&gt; Please let me know if you can find those articles, I really am
interested in reading them.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Frank R.

&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     
&gt;             We&#x27;ve been using the K II for about a year and a half
and they&#x27;re ok as a low cost emf 
&gt; 
&gt; detector. Moving any emf meter too fast will likely result in false
positives but a slow pan 
&gt; 
&gt; across a wall to look for electrical ground leaks will increase
reliabilty. We look for emf 
&gt; 
&gt; fields in excess of 7 milligause, the K II can detect of to 20
milligause. Studies suggest and 
&gt; 
&gt; controlled experiments verify that consistant exposure in excess of
7 milligause can result 
&gt; 
&gt; in the precieved feeling of being watched or a presense by an unseen
force. People 
&gt; 
&gt; sometimes feel it&#x27;s an invisible intelligence but really it&#x27;s the
brains response to the 
&gt; 
&gt; synapse activity.  People sometimes interpret stimuli in a way that
is familiar, in the case 
&gt; 
&gt; of high emf exposure we think it may be a spirit in the room. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; But that&#x27;s not to say the location can&#x27;t be haunted as well. It&#x27;s
just that if a particular room 
&gt; 
&gt; has a lot of reported paranormal activity and there is a high emf
field then you may want 
&gt; 
&gt; to consider that fact in your evaluation of the location.
Interesting, there is alternate 
&gt; 
&gt; research that suggest that exposure to substantial emf fields and
the resulting increase in 
&gt; 
&gt; nerve ends firing in the brain that genuine psychic abilities are
possible. This was referred 
&gt; 
&gt; to in the book Spook by Mary Roach.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Any device can be repurposed as a communication tool including the K
II. While some 
&gt; 
&gt; users believe that the involutary muscle twitches that occur while
holding down the switch 
&gt; 
&gt; is sort of like what happens when holding a pendulum, others prefer
to have a selectable 
&gt; 
&gt; on / off switch on their K II. The manufacturer has started offering
that option according 
&gt; 
&gt; to some of the local groups that have been selling the modified
versions on eBay.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Good morning all,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;    
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;       I have used this meter with great success as well as with
great dismay.  I have had 
&gt; 
&gt; the meter &quot;pennied down&quot; sitting on a table top, and have a toy in
another room respond 
&gt; 
&gt; to me without any activity on the meter.  I feel it is the spirit&#x27;s
choice and in which manner 
&gt; 
&gt; it feels more comfortable in communicating with you.  I have had
lights turn off and back 
&gt; 
&gt; on again in succession in response to questions and no activity on
the meter, and then I 
&gt; 
&gt; have had no other responses except the meter, so once again it is
entirely up to the entity 
&gt; 
&gt; and how it wishes to respond.  In regards to the new apartment
building, check the history 
&gt; 
&gt; of the land that it sits on.  In a few of my occasions it has been
the energy tied to the land 
&gt; 
&gt; or former land owners that has caused the activity.  I have done an
investigation in a &quot;new 
&gt; 
&gt; construction&quot; home site that the family had not moved into yet and
the activity was on the 
&gt; 
&gt; increase, the new owners bought this piece of property as a wooded
lot with
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  no prior establishment being on site, to anyones knowledge that
is.  To all of our 
&gt; 
&gt; surprise, land records had nothing available for that property other
than the location and 
&gt; 
&gt; the pertinent info, however further research and many phone calls
later it was discovered 
&gt; 
&gt; that the property sat on the edge of a local Indian tribal
settlement from the 1700&#x27;s 
&gt; 
&gt; (thanks to the Dept. of the Interior and the Bureau of Native
American (Indian) Affairs.  It 
&gt; 
&gt; just goes to show you that persistence and continued research pays
off in the long run 
&gt; 
&gt; ( this one took about 4 months to research).  So Travis just keep
checking and get all you 
&gt; 
&gt; can on the property from as far back as you can, you never know what
you might fond out.
