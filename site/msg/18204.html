&gt;       Well, I for one, hope David is right about Obama leaving office.  Of course, that would mean Joe Biden would be president... sigh.  That isn&#x27;t a happy thought either.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I hope there is not another war.  I just heard somewhere of secret plans to attack Iran.  Lol, if I heard about it, it must not be very secret.
