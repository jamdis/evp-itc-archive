When it comes to the Ouija, I just want to study it to find out if it is re=
ally spirit communication, or just kinetic energy or your subconscious mind=
 moving the planchette.

I agree that we all have the ability for extra sen=
sory perception, just some are better at it than others. Like running, for =
instance. We all can run, but some are naturally better at it. Still, with =
practice we can get better.

But that is not my aim with the Ouija.

  There's always the questi=
on in the back of your mind whether your partner's moving it.  The intentio=
ns of "what" you are talking to.  Not to mention it's too slow and limited.=

   
  Besides if you take the time to develop the ability you can get more=
 texture in the information.  Asking the board "where you married?" may get=
 you a "yes" but a psychic might get the sense of a religious or civil cere=
monhy, the garment(s) worn, other's in the party, or whether that Being app=
roved/disapproved of their spouse (ie was it a reluctant union).

  Yeah-that's the problem with it I hav=

bring up religion.
