<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>has anyone seen the new ghost hunting camera listed on ebay? it says there 
is a ghost in every picture.
i wonder if this is the next medium fakes will be using as gospel proof 
showing  ghosts.
these will probably be the next picts on youtube or the like and give 
skeptics more food to show we are all wrong or something.
jst my 2 cents.
