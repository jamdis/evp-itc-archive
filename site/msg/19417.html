"On the first, they saw the comet"...(?)...
=C2=A0
Yes, it sounds perfectly=
 clear to me. 
=C2=A0
At first I thought the word=C2=A0"comet" might also s=
ound a bit=C2=A0like (they saw/the/m) "COMING", but after multiple listenin=
gs I can definitely hear the hard "t" and sharp ending=C2=A0with this=C2=A0=
message. 
=C2=A0
It drops of too quickly to be anything ending with "ing" (=
or so I seem to hear). ;)
=C2=A0
You shouldn't quit anything, you!

There's lots of times when you and other members hear things in my own (and=
 others) recordings that I just don't get at all. It happens. The first tim=
e I heard Edison's voice was on a clip that=C2=A0I was mis-interpreting and=
 you=C2=A0pointed out for me=C2=A0(!). After that I couldn't even hear the =
original message as I had first heard it. 
=C2=A0
To end, I'm learning a lo=
t from listening to the files that you and Frank and our other members subm=
it for review and I notice two completely different styles and sounds in th=
e messages both of you (and all of us) tend to look for and feel attracted/=
drawn to. I usually only "get" about half of what Frank shares with his fil=
es...his ears are definitely "tuned" differently, I think, hahaha.
