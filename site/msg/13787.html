  The problem we run into is what actually constitutes evidence of spi=
rit communication? This is the heart of the matter. As I said in the other =
thread, one cannot simply assume that unexplained information defacto prove=
s spirit communication or even external sources. 

  The reason is simple. =
It is quite possible for internal and/or external influences to be exerted =
in an experiment. Let us say you are doing an experiment and you are the on=
ly participant. We'll set aside the obvious challenge of reporting credibil=
ity for the moment. How do you truly know it's not you and even worse, how =
do you know who in fact the external communicator is? Simply knowing facts =
is not sufficient. Especially in cases where PK may be in play (such as the=
 Ouija example) a remote PK agent could be influencing the planchette. Befo=
re ruling this out, consider that the very notion that anyone is moving any=
thing is problematic for many people. And spirit communication pushes the e=
dge of the belief envelope for others. In the end, all of this is some form=
 of anomalous phenomena. You could know things of which you are unaware. Co=
nsider that you might be clairvoyant and not even realize it. If you were t=
o externalize this through a latent PK mechanism, bingo, you are the agent =
and the source of information. Yet to all appearances the information came =
from elsewhere and you therefore presume it must be external to yourself, w=
hich in this example would not be true..



  I was taking advantage of the=
 physical nature of the experiment I proposed. Unfortunately this is what i=
s required if one wishes to remove reliance on belief systems alone. This i=
s what many in the field are looking for. From my own work with mediums and=
 other sensitives, I have learned the perils and the potential pitfalls wit=
h our own perceptual systems, memories and recall. All of this works agains=
t us in even the most trivial experimental set up, which is unfortunate but=
 true. This is yet one more reason to exercise caution with solely anecdota=
l experimental outcomes. You will find that independent historical validati=
on is actualy pretty tricky, as I have said before, because it often is not=
 simply factual in nature. It tends to be more about emotions and feelings =
and that's where specifically identifying an individual gets dicey.



  I =
wish you all the best in your efforts, whatever path you may chose.
