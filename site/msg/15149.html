<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>There&#x27;s another possibility: possibly the spirits involved only wish to
impart sounds to a particular unit or units.

I was surprised on one investigation I was on to get mostly all the same EVP
on my DVR, which was hanging from my belt, and my camcorder, which was in
front of my face. Other people on the investigation didn&#x27;t get them at all.
Go figure!

&gt;   There could be several reasons, and it&#x27;s only conjecture without
&gt; comparing the two specific units in questions.  But some ideas:
&gt;
&gt; 1) The battery level on one is different than the other, and causing one to
&gt; function less optimally and introduce noise or artifacts into the stream.
&gt; 2) They were not actually &#x27;sitting&#x27; side by side, but being swung around.
&gt; 3) They are pointed at different areas
&gt; 4) One may be older than the other or have been dropped a few times.
&gt; 5) One may have been recently exposed to extreme humidity or temperatures,
&gt; while the other remained in a comfortable environment, before doing this
&gt; recording
&gt; 6) One may be sitting in a position more subject by airflow or vibrations
&gt; 7) They may use different memory cards. that have different error or
&gt; accuracy profiles
&gt; 8) The final sound files may have been processed differently in various
&gt; software programs
&gt; 9) People in the room may be nearer and moving closer to one than the other
&gt; 10) They may simply be two different models with different recording
&gt; sensitives and limitations

&gt;  Hi,
&gt; I believe I saw an explaination on this list about why if you have 2
&gt; recorders sitting side by side, why may one capture an EVP on one and not
&gt; the other? Someone was explaining about an energy field like a bubble.
&gt; I&#x27;m trying to explain this theory to a friend. Can someone help me?
&gt; Thanks Laura
