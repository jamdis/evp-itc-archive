<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Maybe too noisy--or tooo scary! Oh wait, end of days, doesn&#x27;t that mean
just a transformation, and everything will be all hunky dory?  There was
something about using a weapon, and energy required, and the timing, but
counld quite make it out. Guessing, they could shoot a missile at the comet
to deflect it, but the timing would be critical, and it would take a lot of
energy, &#x27;course the skeptics would say there is no comet, and no one is
going to do a damn thing! Why do I think everything else is trivia to the
extreme?
