&gt; It&#x27;s too bad you didn&#x27;t get more participation.  I&#x27;d be happy to be part of
&gt; the second test too.
&gt;
&gt; One thing I&#x27;d suggest: remove any question(s) that you are asking, from the
&gt; audio file.  Since you&#x27;re trying to study how different people will
&gt; interpret the same file, and are trying not to give any hints as to what
&gt; other people hear in the file, leaving the question in could be a factor
&gt; there.  For example, if you are asking a yes/no question in the audio, then
&gt; the people listening might be inclined to restrict their answers to having
&gt; heard a &quot;yes&quot; or a &quot;no&quot; (because the question implies that is what may
&gt; follow).  But by leaving the question out, you remove any hints as to what
&gt; they should expect.

&gt;   The first test did not go so well participation levels were not so
&gt; good and that may be partaly my fault so I would like to try this
&gt; again .
&gt; I have a different file I would like to privatly email to anyone
&gt; willing to listen to it. All you have to do is send me what you hear
&gt; and how clear it was to you.
&gt;
&gt; I dont know if I have ever made mention of this before but my time
&gt; is extremly limited I work Mon-Thurs 6am till 5pm then go to school
&gt; those days 630 till 930pm so fri sat and sun are the only days I have
&gt; to answer emails or read the board. also igo by the screan name
&gt; nightparanormalrese arch (obviosly).The name Northern IL Ghost Hunting
&gt; Team is my wife Sarah we are both part of the same nonprofit
&gt; organization here in our home town (N.I.G.H.T). So if iam a little
&gt; busy I may have her answer somthing or post somthing if Iam unable
&gt; otherwise youll always get me first thing friday and sat so if
&gt; someone has a question on a post for me depending on what day it is
&gt; you may have to wait till fri or sat.
&gt; I just wanted to put that out ther so noone thinks Iam ignoring
&gt; them or not answering emails.
&gt; Now back to the test I will send out the new file to all those who
&gt; participated in the last one and any one who would also like to
&gt; participate let me know via email nightparanormalrese arch@yahoo. com&lt;http://mc/compose?to=nightparanormalresearch%40yahoo.com&gt;
&gt; and i will gladly send it to you.If you participated on the last one
&gt; but dont want to on this one just ignore the email ill be sending.
&gt; Thank you to all those who have taken the time to listen to the
&gt; first one and I truly apoligize that it was a bust but I think this
&gt; one will be alot better as I have mor time to spend and i wont be
&gt; rushing.
