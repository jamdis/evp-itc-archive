<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Besides adding the three access points so you can now control the 
devices from outside the closed chamber, I&#x27;ve also added an object 
container inside the chamber.  They say objects retain memory in some 
cases, like film or recording tape.  If that is the case you can place 
an object inside the container; an object which was once owned by a 
person/spirit you are trying to contact.  The memory, if within the 
object, could mix with the raw audio, white noise, and ambient noise 
within the sound chamber to be captured by the amplified microphone, 
which is fed to the recorder and the earphones or speaker.  The 
container can be removed from the chamber if desired, since it is 
velcro-ed onto the case, as are the other devices.
