I have just decided\nthat it is time for me to do other things but it is ideal for anyone\nwanting to put together their own SPIRICOM device. I just wanted to\nlet anyone know in case they were looking for a nice working unit? It\nis only a 1 day sale so grab it if you want. The link to my sale is\nhttp://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=130217909866\n\nThank you and have a great day all!\n\nJohn Miller"}
