Not much room for the &quot;gargage.&quot;  I for one prefer  \n&gt; to hear the important message words, knowing full well the author  \n&gt; edited the file.  If someone wants to present false stuff so that  \n&gt; he or she gets false praise from us,  god bless them if they need  \n&gt; the praise.  For scientific research with original files...that&#39; s  \n&gt; another story.

Anyone that  \n&gt; cleans a file in this way should not be touching any bit of the file\n&gt; that has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously  \n&gt; garbage like the &quot;EH O EH AH O EH UR&quot; in between words.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example &quot;Is there anyone here that wishes to communicate_  \n&gt; YES_AH ER EEH AR OOO AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE&quot;\n&gt; It is much easier for me as a researcher to be able to return to a  \n&gt; file that I recieved two weeks ago and that I believe may hold some\n&gt; relivence to a message I just received and be able to cleanly  \n&gt; listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage sounds.\n&gt;\n&gt; At this stage in real time communication the messages are the top  \n&gt; priority.\n&gt; I do however agree that the untouched version should be retained  \n&gt; and made available to individuals that make a request\n&gt; for any intelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that may be  \n&gt; made, and god knows there are always fanatical\n&gt; sceptics lurking in the shadows awaiting an opportunity to attack  \n&gt; an unwary or injured researcher. I do not think that\n&gt; our research files should be made available on request by every tom  \n&gt; dick and harry that is unknown to us and may potentially\n&gt; doctor the file to suit their own point and post it as such.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the  \n&gt; researcher that receives the request for raw research data should\n&gt; scrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment before  \n&gt; handing out any research data.\n&gt;\n&gt; These are my thoughts on the subject of cleaning a file.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n&gt; From: yahoogroups@ stefanbion. de\n&gt; Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2008 09:55:42 +0200\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Editing EVP\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I would\n&gt; suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, in\n&gt; order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can for\n&gt; instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip (including\n&gt; the experimenter&#39; s voice), filter or denoise it to make it  \n&gt; clearer, but\n&gt; not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP  \n&gt; match\n&gt; with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should always\n&gt; be provided along with the edited version.\n&gt;\n&gt; But that&#39;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to  \n&gt; express, as\n&gt; we should always be able to present our results to a critical public.\n&gt;\n&gt; Stefan\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these files.\n&gt; &gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that\n&gt; &gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the message\n&gt; &gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise that\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can&#39;t piece these\n&gt; &gt; files together to make something it&#39;s not, so i keep them in true\n&gt; &gt; form pretty much to the original.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Steve\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, Ron Lederer &lt;ronriko@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hey Steve Forgot to ask...how much editing was needed to get this\n&gt; &gt; file?
