In my previous post, I accidentally entered the same link twice (the guide for using Praat software to make Spectrograms).

I&#39;ve attached a jpeg of the Spectrogram of the EVP.  As I&#39;m new to this software, and not familiar with its features, I present the Spectrogram without any editing.  BTW, I captured this image by making a screenshot, pasted it into Photoshop and then saved it as a jpeg.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sharon from S.F.\n&gt;"}
