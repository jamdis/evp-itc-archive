A (modern) germanium diode could be used instead and soldered\n&gt; across the socket terminals.\n&gt; The wire on the coil looks like its loosing its insulation so the coil is\n&gt; probably faulty and would have to be re-wound.\n&gt; JEFF\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com &lt;EVP-ITC%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Kris Bronson\n&gt; &lt;the_rocker_chick1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll be the first to admit I&#39;m no expert when it comes to ITC.

The results still never cease to amaze me!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyhow, I came across this device at an estate auction. It appears to be\n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; antique communication device of some sort. The only verifiable\n&gt; information I\n&gt; &gt; have is that is was probably built around 1910-1912, which is before\n&gt; radio was\n&gt; &gt; publicly available.\n&gt; &gt; (I obtained this date from researching the packaging cylinder used to\n&gt; build the\n&gt; &gt; device.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any thoughts on what it might be? I did show this device\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; Chris a while back and he agreed that it probably was a communication\n&gt; device. He\n&gt; &gt; also suggested I show it to Frank... = )\n&gt; &gt; According to Chris&#39;s box, &quot;this IS a communication device of historical\n&gt; value.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; It also mentioned the device was &quot;meant specifically for me to have, but\n&gt; no\n&gt; &gt; longer worked.&quot; There was more, but I&#39;m trying to remain unbiased and\n&gt; only\n&gt; &gt; use tangible evidence. However, I have little to go on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If anyone has any clues or can lead me in a research direction I would\n&gt; &gt; appreciate it!
