Reading what you've wrote below, I'm still leaning toward a haunting-type situation worsened by the honing of your psychic abilities in using the ghost box.  And even though you say that you don't have ESP, trust me, you do now.  There's something about using the box that seems to enhance this ability in some people.

About your "head counters" on the other side:  very interesting.  Maybe this would account for the lying?  If those who talk to us are being monitored, maybe they can't tell us the truth, and so want to tell us something to keep us talking to them?  I have read about people who've had paranormal experiences with their dead loved ones, and they've been told that they can only talk about certain things.  If you read, for instance, the book "Hello from Heaven," nearly every single encounter in that book consists of the message, "I'm fine, don't worry about me, I love you."  As if there's a rule book that only permits the dead to tell the living these simple facts.  In my own (limited) experience, "I love you" seems to be the most common message I receive.  Like, over and over and over again.  Which jives with your "head counters'" rules, I should think.
