<DIV>Here is a short file, where someone says, "Scamp, Scamp," then =
Scamp barks. "yap."  This little dog belonged to my grandma, when I wa=
s about 9 or 10 years old, he was a Manchester Terrier, and lived with us f=
or many years, and this is his bark for sure.  I'd know that bark anyw=
here.  Sorry, that I can't make it any clearer, I need to get one of t=
hose better ghost boxes I guess.  RJ, spirits are just like us, t=
hey are not omnipresent like God,  probably why David doesn't wan=
t to play the guessing game, he has better things to do over there, and has=
 said, they have thousands of people standing in this long line waiting to =
get into the Heavens, and He can't just drop His job and go to your house t=
o see what you have over there, He did tell me that first time what it was,=
 and i sent it to you, but it was too late.  It's hard for me to under=
stand them sometimes, He was also right about that little boy, Syler being
=
 killed, and where his body would be found, I don't know what they did abou=
t it though. sf</DIV></FONT>
