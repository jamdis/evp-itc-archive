<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks to everyone who participated in Experiment 3.

On Friday, 7/30/2010 I placed an object on top of my computer monitor, right in front of me, and left it there until noon Denver time on Monday, 8/2/2010.   This experiment asked for participants to determine what that object was. Vague or partial answers won&#x27;t be counted (for example, just giving a color, shape, size,  what it&#x27;s made of, etc): we&#x27;re looking for what it is. Answers anyone reveals after noon Denver time Monday won&#x27;t count.  Participants could use their ghost boxes, EVP recorders, or any other means they chose.  

In order to keep me honest, I took a picture of the object at the start of the experiment and loaded it to the Files section (RJ folder) of this group.  The idea with this file is that you could download it at the beginning of the experiment and &#x27;keep it safe&#x27; on your computer. Then at the end of the experiment, I would post the password so you could reveal the contents of the file. That way, you were in control of the original image during the entire time, not me.  

Passworded pdf: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100730.pdf

The password for that file is: 867530Nieine

So to the results:

Number of participants: 2
Total tries: 3
Ambiguous answers: 0
Correct answers: 0

Object: A Pot
Object picture: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/RJ/RJ20100730.jpg


If anyone has any observations, comments, or ideas for improvement, let me know. Again, thanks to everyone who participated in this experiment.</pre>
