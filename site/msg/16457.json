Now, how should I begin?  I have the recorder, do I need a noise source (like static or something) to get results?  My goal at this point is to get one convincing sample to show my friend that I&#39;m not crazy.\n\nI&#39;ve read a few books, most state to say a prayer or something to that effect beforehand.  Personally, I don&#39;t think there are &quot;demons&quot; per se.  Negative spirits, probably; but beings who are created just to be evil?  No.\n\nAgain, thank you!"}
