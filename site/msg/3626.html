Before things go overboard here, Please clarify something: are these  
issues personal (as in someone is making threats against you) or have  
you been told by the manufacturer that there&#x27;s a proprietary  
technology issue here? This is this business related, then we don&#x27;t  
want to act against the advice of your legal council.

&gt; Colleagues,
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for your concern.
&gt; Events that unfolded early this morning have prompted me to
&gt; effectively close the Ghostboxhacks site for the near term.
&gt; Do to the nature of these events it is inappropriate to discuss the
&gt; matter in a public form such as this.
&gt;
&gt; Please do not speculate on the nature of this event. I am sorry,
&gt; after talking to council I removed my statement from Ghostboxhacks.
&gt; I don&#x27;t want to fuel wild speculation.
&gt;
&gt; I wish I could go in to greater detail, at this time I have been
&gt; advised not to.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you, Everyone for your emails and concern.
