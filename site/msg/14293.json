A little girl gives me a DATE of the year that is import=\r\nant to her. She says &quot;1927&quot; You will need headphones here people. I enhance=\r\nd.....mainly so you can begin to hear where she will begin to speak. Is not=\r\n much improvement over the original audio, but serves as a &quot;marker&quot; notific=\r\nation when the background audio gets quiter. She sounds so sweet :) I hope =\r\nwe become friends. The file is in my folder &quot;Jim&#39;s RR-DR60 EVP&#39;s&quot; the audio=\r\n is called &quot;important_date_enhanced_evp&quot;. The reason I asked for an importa=\r\nnt date is so I could PROVE that I wasn&#39;t just getting some random interfer=\r\nance, or a &quot;natural&quot; spectral recording (the recordings left around locatio=\r\nns associated with intense emotions) I wish I had a way of doing these conv=\r\nersations LIVE. Well at least close enough that they wouldn&#39;t get bored wai=\r\nting for me to answer back. This is frustrating :) Don&#39;t want to just rambl=\r\ne on here folks.
