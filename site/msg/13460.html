<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I&#x27;d be more than willing to participate. i&#x27;ve been using binaurals for
years (sounds similar if not the same technology). Ironically enough I
also dabbled in Reiki :p I&#x27;d still be considered lvl1 though. I have
seen the images which are supposed to enhance abilities and while I
notice power, I can&#x27;t utilize it. Anyways, I&#x27;d be very happy to join
you in this, especially if its frequency is this beneficial.

&gt; Very cool YouTube video. 
&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sonpvUxGL8 
&gt; 
&gt; The patterns reminded me of Emoto&#x27;s work with water, but this is
&gt; sound.  Really interesting.  
&gt; 
&gt; My hearing is very sensitive, so I don&#x27;t know how much of, or for how
&gt; long, the sounds I heard that I would be able to tolerate.  But I&#x27;m
&gt; going to go browse a little more or your web site.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I&#x27;d like to introduce myself.. and share this information with the
&gt; group here in the hopes that some members may have an interest in
&gt; participating in an experimental research project.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Im looking for people who are willing to participate in our online
&gt; experiment and can provide input, feedback and comparison on some of
&gt; the various digital frequency files we are using.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; After many years of researching, on going development and testing
&gt; our current experimental group of approximately 2000 volunteers have
&gt; been witness to some really unusual and intense phenomena playing
&gt; out... bordering on the supra-normal. We&#x27;re seeing rapid, profound
&gt; effects on the body and mind occuring via this new acoustic frequency
&gt; tool.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Specifically, one of the areas we are focusing on now and are hoping
&gt; to collect more data on are the effects on the mind and body from the
&gt; use of
&gt; &gt; frequencies designed to entrain the body and mind towards those
&gt; states conducive to the experience of ascension and the manifestation
&gt; of desired positive change.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I recently released new &#x27;frequency&#x27; protoypes that our group has
&gt; been testing and their reports of the results they have been
&gt; experiencing have been staggering.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Implications currently, are for enormous  potential improvements for
&gt; health and wellness as well as rapid change from challenging mind and
&gt; emotional states to ones of increased vitality, increased performance
&gt; and increased well being and balance.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; One possible and very real application of this may be to address
&gt; both general and specific aspects of health issues.  For example one
&gt; of our members experimented with effects on the blood , had an
&gt; independent lab analyze his blood sample and it seems like there was a
&gt; dramatic change in the bloods terrain!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Data collected to date on reaction responses have been over the top
&gt; &gt; favourable.....
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We are finding that actual &#x27;things&#x27; are happening, when these
&gt; frequencies are simply played. Very noticeable and dramatic effects
&gt; and changes in the body, mind and environment - unlike anything
&gt; induced by any other sound (that we know of).  many people who
&gt; experimented on these frequencies report that they are unlike other
&gt; existing technologies such as binaural beats.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What we need right now however, are more volunteers who are willing
&gt; to test out our other frequencies and keep a log of their findings and
&gt; report their observations to our group. There is no cost required for
&gt; testing frequencies, the primary benefit to my group and I is the
&gt; collection of data.... the benefit to you, well... once you see what
&gt; we are engaged in, I think you will be more than satisfied with the
&gt; experience.....
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Two things important here, one is to share with you the observations
&gt; of our
&gt; &gt; group in their process of discovery in relation to the health
&gt; related frequency track - the thought being, that you are likely to
&gt; not only find this intrinsically interesting and newsworthy but also
&gt; inspiring. The second is to provide you with a means of facilitating
&gt; your own journey through this phenomena in the hopes you can share
&gt; your own unique findings with us.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Feel free to view a recent post on our research forum that details
&gt; how to access this information and also various frequency tracks you
&gt; can download.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Examples of recent reports by users ;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; “I am struck with the effects that sound has on the physical
&gt; structure. That is, especially in the subtle tissues like neurons and
&gt; synapses. Case in point, I don&#x27;t hesitate in expressing myself just
&gt; the way it comes out. No coloring, no bravado, no bullshit....the
&gt; endorphine level in the body went way up. I have noted from my initial
&gt; listening of this freq. is that it appears to synchronize the 2
&gt; hemispheres of the brain and thought became markedly coherent. ..
&gt; perhaps the feeling of increased endorphine flow could be an actual
&gt; increase in neuro- transmitter presence, particularly seratonin.... As
&gt; things ended I was left with this feeling of balance and well being. I
&gt; definitely want to work with this sequence more. It seems to be the
&gt; right one for me currently. I probably want to post this explanation
&gt; on the Yahoo site. I&#x27;ll be sending my initial impressions in another
&gt; email to you shortly. Thanks again for this amazing opportunity.”
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; “This morning I listened to kindle mind set, I have had family in
&gt; and had not used the fequencies for a week. The first sensations were
&gt; an extreme energy from my hands I am a Reiki Master but the energy and
&gt; heat I felt was more than I had experienced before.There was a
&gt; bubbling feeling inside my chest their was intense tingling of my
&gt; chest and torso, a sensual, sexual feel.My arms legs and feet were
&gt; extremely warm, I am usually cold. It felt like my blood was
&gt; bubbling.I had an effervesce feeling in my mouth. My feet tingled and
&gt; as I nwas laying on the chaise listening, I closed my eyes and was
&gt; enjoying a full color animated video like p roduction without sound.
&gt; This is first time I have seen anything other than a magenta colored
&gt; flower.I listened to kindle set for about 3 hours. I have Bose
&gt; speakers on the computer I used this morning.”
