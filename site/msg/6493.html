I haven't started box recording yet.  My impression of the EVP I've capture=
d (which has been almost entirely obtained on the property I moved to six y=
ears ago) is that someone is attached to this place.  The first message was=
 "Here come some people," as I was hiking up the hill one day with my goats=
, then a kill-you threat in the house, then "get out of here" in the barn. =
 I assumed it must be one of the original owners, and I still feel that it'=
s mainly one spirit communicating that this is their home, not mine.  I've =
gotten one uplifting message from what I believe to be the same entity, and=
 this is also the last recording I've gotten.  I asked what death is like, =
compared to life: happy, beautiful, fulfilling--and specifically if death i=
s less depressing.  The response was "It's everything."  S/he/it basically =
stopped talking after that, and I stopped trying.  I know this sounds weird=
, but I miss whoever or whatever it was.  I wonder if some of us might be b=
etter at dealing with the low-life stuck or grounded entities rather than t=

  EVP:

=
  Not that this is always the case, but EVP seems to primarily capture 
  l=
ost people - ghosts being recorded, versus the box having the 
  ability to=
 capture primarily what seems to be higher communication 
  from spirits, (=
and less of the lower communication - ghosts jumping 
  in).

  That to me =
is a huge difference... ;)
