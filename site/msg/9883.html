I ran across it again today one the c2c site so I checked out the local news site to see if they had the photo. They had quite a few of them on there. I can see why some were quick to decide who/what they were seeing considering the atmosphere. I know it well my mother was a frequent visitor there. As for me, not so quick to presume but I did enjoy the imagery and thier ability to capture it! Check it out.
