<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Ok, I just posted pics of the auto-scan mod for the 12-820 I mentioned
I&#x27;d be doing.  Its a really simple mod for anyone that has basic
soldering experience.

Pics of the finished mod are in my folder &quot;Marty&#x27;s goldBox&quot; - 

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Marty%27s%20goldBox/

Brief directions on how to attach the switch -

1) Cut the protective tape off around the up scan contact (or down
scan if you want to use that) using an x-acto knife.

2) Remove the contact bubble switch.

3) Prime the middle contact circle and a spot on the outer contact
circle with a small blob of solder, and of course prime your wires.

4) Gently heat the wire as you place it to the solder point on the
inner or outer circle (whichever one you want to start with) - i.e.
the wire should gently sink in to the now heating solder blob.  Let
cool, and add more solder to it if the connection feels too flimsy,
being very careful not to let any solder accidentally connect the two
solder points.  Another words, care must be taken not to accidentally
solder the outer and inner circles together.


This mod cuts out the problem of random stalls in the auto-scanning of
the tuner I was talking about.  Just flip the switch, and it scans
continuously. 

I&#x27;ll be doing the same switch mod with the power on button as well, as
I want to mount this all in a case that I&#x27;ll be adding to a special
box I&#x27;m putting together as well (the entire thing being called a
goldBox when it&#x27;s finished).  I&#x27;ll be documenting all of that here,
and continuing to put pics up of the entire design and creation
process in my folder then.
