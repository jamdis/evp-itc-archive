Hi Everyone!

I'm new and I s=
tumbled onto this group after doing some research
online into EVP. I consid=
er myself to be a paranormal skeptic, but I
have heard some very interestin=
g EVP evidence and would like to look
into it further. I joined this group =
because I am interested in
submitting EVP data to some rigorous scientific =
analysis. I'm an
electrical engineer and mainly work in the areas of signal=
 processing
and communications so all of this is extremely interesting. 

I=
 am interested in collecting some of my own data (at some point) by
buildin=
g a ghost box based on Frank Sumption's designs. I am working
from the "Gho=
st Box Notebook" from 2007, but I am having a hard time
getting started. Ha=
s anyone built one of these and are there any
parts lists or more complete =
schematics floating around? I would
appreciate any build help or advice any=
 of you might have.

Regards,

Anna
