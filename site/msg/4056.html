&gt; I got a very good session through the 12-470 radio today on AM.  I had 
&gt; asked our technicians Mike and Lisa if they can bring John Lennon 
&gt; foward to speak with me and they did.  John Lennon has been my idol 
&gt; all my life and today is the 27 year anniversary of his death.  Mike 
&gt; and Lisa work very well with me in contacting the ones i try to get 
&gt; to.  In the next post you will hear the file i got, which may be the 
&gt; best file i ever got with any radio or box.  I asked if John was aware 
&gt; of how he died and he responded &quot;Yes, Bullet&quot;.  As everyone probably 
&gt; knows that John Lennon was shot outside his home in NYC in 1980.  I 
&gt; can&#x27;t believe that our friends on the other side are so comfortable 
&gt; with me, that they keep exceeding my expectations of what i will hear 
&gt; through any of these devices.  I also have other files from this 
&gt; session, but this was the most important one and proves that i am 
&gt; speaking with spirits on another plane.
