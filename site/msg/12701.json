If \nyou are looking for scalar waves, you might want to verify that what \nyou&#39;re detecting isn&#39;t normal RF. Scalar waves do not show up on a normal \nRF or EMF detector.  Also, it would indicate the presence of a radio \ntransmitter in the area strong enough to possibly affect recording \nequipment. My Olympus VN960PC does pick up radio stations in its audio \nwhen I&#39;m within a couple hundred feet of an antenna.\n\nZack\n\nOn Sun, 9 Nov 2008, Bagheera BL wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Zack,\n&gt; why do you feel RF should be investigated?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Vincent Rodrigue\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Message initial ----\n&gt; De : Zack Widup &lt;w9sz@...&gt;\n&gt; Envoy� le : dimanche 9 novembre 2008, 14 h 28 min 28 s\n&gt;\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; Note there is an RF sniffer part of the circuit to indicate whether normal RF fields are present at the time.\n&gt; [...]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;      Devenez un meilleur amigo gr�ce � Yahoo!
