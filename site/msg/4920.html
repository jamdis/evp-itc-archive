Hiya Bruce,

Besides the broken cellphone I was going to mention an old Med=
asonics Doppler that got damaged from amniotic fluid during a birth I was a=
ttending a few years ago.  I think both these gadgets could have potential =
in the field of EVP-ITC research!

I actually did listen to all your files =
last night and was very impressed.  VERY impressed!  I don't comment very o=
ften because I feel extremely intimidated by what you all are accomplishing=
 here, and all I have is my little digital recorder and no knowledge of ele=
ctronics at all.  I really think your work is awesome.  

I have a wanderin=
g mind but will do my best to stay on topic from now on.

Robin/OR

 a wet blanket


  But ,

  yesterday I posted like 20 files and did not re=
cieve one reply on any 
  of them.

  Yet a post about a broken cell phone =
recieves a hundred replies.
  What is this group about?

  Frank is right w=
hat the hell is the sense of posting files to an EVP-ITC
  group if no one =
pays attention to the evp's or files that are posted.

  I admit I do not r=
eply to every single post myself but I do try and 
  reply to most.

  If n=
o one is even bothering to listen to the files you are really 
  missing wh=
at this is all about.

  Come o9n guy's this is supposed to be about the ex=
change of ideas and 
  constructive suggestions on evp-itc research. It's n=
ot a chat board or 
  a forum for personal vendeta's

  Let's get with the =
program and do some evp work.

  And I'll bet I get some replies to this po=
st that's for sure !

  Bruce
