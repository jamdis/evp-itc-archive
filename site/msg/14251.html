<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yeah that&#x27;s true. I&#x27;ve used the SMD devices and put these circuits on a
couple square inches of board or less. If you ever need help programming
PIC&#x27;s or AVR&#x27;s let me know. I&#x27;m pretty good at it.

&gt; I&#x27;ve kinda looked at that, but it takes more chips--more board real estate.
&gt; Besides, don&#x27;t know the programming for the PIC chips

&gt;&gt;  I know it&#x27;s more complicated, but have you thought of using a direct
&gt;&gt; frequency synthesis chip like the Analog Devices AD9835 or AD9850 and a PIC
&gt;&gt; or AVR microcontroller to adjust the frequency? These chips are impossible
&gt;&gt; to pull off frequency and are easily made to sweep in any manner you wish,
&gt;&gt; with the microcontroller. I&#x27;ve been playing with generating spread-spectrum
&gt;&gt; signals with them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;   I have kind of a steep learning curve, so while the NE602/612 radio
&gt;&gt;&gt; works, it has a bigger foot print cuz it requires some extra amplifiers for
&gt;&gt;&gt; the audio. I have about 70 of the LM3820 chips, they are an AM radio chip,
&gt;&gt;&gt; with all functions except the audio detector. I had trouble getting this
&gt;&gt;&gt; chip to work a couple years ago, but since I&#x27;ve learned some tricks, like
&gt;&gt;&gt; adding the oscillator buffer to keep the freq counter from pulling the
&gt;&gt;&gt; frequency way off, other wise, ya think you have the frequency range set,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but in use it&#x27;s completely out of the AM band, so no stations get picked
&gt;&gt;&gt; up.Then I was not aware of how to set up the ferrite rod antenna. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; 602/612s are $2 something each, the Lm3820--12 cents from B. G. Micro(in
&gt;&gt;&gt; tubes of 25). I set up the oscillator last night, then re-drew the
&gt;&gt;&gt; schematic. I used a regulated supply to hopefully make the oscialltor more
&gt;&gt;&gt; stable, but the chip will function on 12 volts-besides, come to think about
&gt;&gt;&gt; it, it has a built in regulator, so the 8V regulator is overkill, maybe even
&gt;&gt;&gt; harmful in that  the internal regulator wouldn&#x27;t have enough head room.

Yeah ha &#x27;s ue. I&#x27; e used he SMD de ices and pu hese ci cui s on a couple squa e inches o boa d o less. I you e e need help p og amming PIC&#x27;s o AVR&#x27;s le me know. I&#x27;m p e y good a i .
