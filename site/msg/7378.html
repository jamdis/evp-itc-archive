John,
Frank does not make any boxes to sell. Have already asked, as have ma=
ny
people.
The minibox does work though. Frank has made one of them, and it=
 worked.
They are for sale at this time. The website for ordering one is
ww=
w.paranormalsystems.com.
They are 399.00, and you can even make a down paym=
ent of 100.00 and 
you have six months to pay it off.
Hope this helps.
Deb =
Fransen

VP-ITC] How to obtain a Frank's Box?



Hi Gang,
My name is John Marc Carr,=
 president/founder of SEFGR, South East
Florida Ghost Research. I organized=
 this group in 1998, and have been in
the research of Ghost and Paranormal =
happenings ever since. I'm the
official paranormal researcher for the Stran=
ahan House which is Fort
Lauderdale's oldest and most haunted historical la=
ndmark. We have gotten
many EVP's by use of digital recorder. There are 5 i=
ntelligent haunts
that are in the house and one residual haunt outside of t=
he house. Most
of the evp work has been handled by me, but I have been teac=
hing some of
my member to work their own recordings.
 
I am totally fascina=
ted by your use of the "Frank's Box". My
congradulations to your success, F=
rank and those who use the box on the
research that you've accomplished. In=
 this, I'm also dissappointed by
those who have used your box to make money=
 or notority to gain fame by
it. I won't mention names, to mention them wil=
l only give them more
strength. 
 
We are currently trying to do the Radio =
Shack hack of the 12-469 and
hope to be successful in this trial by error. =
Hoping that our work will
produce something that we've been trying to accom=
plish like you all
have, two way communication with astral beings. It's fus=
trating to do
digital recordings and having to wait and sift through the re=
cordings to
get information. We hope to elliminate that with the hack.
 
Ar=
e Frank's boxes available for retail? I've heard of the Mini Box that
is co=
ming out soon and they are taking pre-orders for this product. Our
group is=
 small and we don't charge for our research at the historical
landmarks tha=
t we do here in Fort Lauderdale, so we are looking for the
best at the lowe=
st route approach.
 
Our next project is a Historical Firehouse that is hau=
nted by the ghost
of Robert Leland Knight. There is a mystery on how he die=
d, but legend
goes that he fallen in a water puddle that was electricfied b=
y a downed
wire. He was a large man and a Golden Glove champ of Florida. It=
 was his
second week of working at the firestation and he didn't have his g=
ear
because it had to be ordered. There is some who think (psychics) that h=
e
might have been pushed out of the firetruck as a prank that went wrong.
 =

This firehouse has had media play with the Sci-fi channel in a show
called=
 "Proof Positive". The firestation is becoming a museum, and is
allowing us=
 to spend the night in doing an investigation about Robert.
There are some =
who believe that some of the haunt has to do with a
hanging tree that was a=
t the opposite corner of the Firestation. We are
excited about doing an inv=
estigation of this Historical Landmark, but
are cautious of the fact that t=
here will be low level spirits/astral
beings that might be present.
 
Frank=
, If you have the time to answer me, that will be great. Those who
have the=
 "Frank's box", if you can tell me how you obtained yours, that
will be hel=
pful also. I would be greatful for any help at this point.
 
Thanks for let=
ting me listen in on all of your discoveries and
successes.
 
Best Regards,=

John Marc Carr
