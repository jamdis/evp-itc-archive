<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank, have you tried asking this entity who tells you this doomsday stuff to go toward the light?  Or otherwise leave you alone?  I&#x27;m wondering if he/she/it is hogging the spotlight and not letting anyone else through.  That time I was getting bullshit answers from &quot;Steve,&quot; and my Uncle Red came through, I swear I heard someone say, &quot;Get away from me&quot; -- as if Red was trying to talk, and Steve was getting in the way somehow.  Just a thought:  maybe your guys are keeping more desirable contact with benevolent entities at bay.  (Like I know anything, I&#x27;m a newbie! Feel free to ignore my posts!  But I just feel so bad for you, that you keep getting all this doomsday stuff.)
