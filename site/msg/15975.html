    Hi Misty,

I like what you said. You are right also in the fact that some know more, s=

                  Thanks, Misty!

                  I had =
a guy named Steve come through almost every session, so maybe he was my "te=
ch." The last session I had before the dry spell (when I quit for a while d=
ue to sickness), Steve was sort of flippant and gave a bunch of stupid answ=
ers, so now I'm kind of hoping he's gone on vacation. But I did two session=
s yesterday, and very little came through except for being told that a fami=
ly friend has died (I'm waiting to see if that bit of prediction has come t=
rue). So maybe, like you said, Steve "led" everyone and made things come th=
rough clearer. I guess time will tell. If he'd behave himself, I'd welcome =
him back.

                  So I'm wondering, what's the rationale behind =
this comment:

                  First, the MiniBox works best with time. I=
f you do not have two hours to devote to a session, you might be disappoint=
ed. You should have the device running in the place you will be using it fo=
r at least 15 minutes; during this time you can fine tune settings and volu=
me. Never expect the Box to "Hit the ground running," so to speak; it happe=
ns occasionally, that an operator can turn on the box and get an immediate =
message, but it hasn't happened often in the ASUP's tests.

               =
   http://www.asup- inc.org/interimm iniboxreport. htm

                  I=
 can't imagine the above quote is good advice. The very first moment I turn=
ed on my little hacked box, I got a clear, loud message: I see you. It frea=
ked me out so bad, I turned it off immediately and it took three days to wo=
rk up the nerve to try again! So I don't know what these people are talking=
 about, that you can't hit the ground running. I've read about lots of folk=
s doing just that.

                  I was kind of thinking that shorter w=
as better, too, but I wanted to make sure, because if I was wrong, maybe le=
tting it run a long time might get even better responses... but yeah, I thi=
nk they get tired, as it probably takes a lot of effort to form those words=
.

                  I was also thinking all those skeptics who say the box=
es don't work are probably not treating their sessions like EVP -- I can ne=
ver hear much of anything during the session, only afterward when I listen =
back and at very high volume. At least for me, most of the bulk of the comm=
unication is very, very quiet and located in between the louder snippets of=
 strong-signaled radio announcer voices. I imagine it might be louder and c=
learer if I took my set-up to a haunted location (or some place lots of hum=
an emotions were felt), but since my set-up isn't really geared for that, I=
 haven't done it yet.
