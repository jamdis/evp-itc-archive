My name is Carla and I \nrecorded my first evp 2 nights ago. \n&gt; Again yesterday I was able to get another one but have not been \nable to tell what it says. I \n&gt; am going to post them in the file section if anyone is interested. \nI also was wondering what \n&gt; everyone thought, especially on the 2nd one since I still don&#39;t \nknow what it says.
