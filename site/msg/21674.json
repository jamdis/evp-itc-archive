I now know three people with a technician named\n&quot;David,&quot; one with one named &quot;Thomas&quot; or &quot;Tom&quot; and I&#39;ve been hearing the\nname &quot;Tom&quot; and &quot;Thomas&quot; and &quot;Stephen.&quot; On another device I use, kind of\nlike an ovilus, I get &quot;Michael&quot; and &quot;John.&quot; Now, my dad&#39;s name is Tom\nand my bother&#39;s name is Stephen, so it does seem kind of obvious that\nthese are names of other people as well, like those who have lived\nbefore and are living now. However, it&#39;s too coincidental  for me to\nignore that these are very specific names of prophets, holy men, angels,\nand apostles, as well.\n\nHas anyone else ever had any theories on this?"}
