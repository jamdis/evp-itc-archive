between words in the message.

&gt; I do remove the &quot;garbage&quot; from my files.
&gt;  
&gt; At this point in my research, the message is more important to me 
than the proof of it.
&gt; I think most of us here will agree that we are receiving some sort 
of paranormal communication.
&gt; but it definitely exists. now we need to concentrate on the 
messages they need us to hear and the answers to the questions
&gt; we ask and in turn our answers to their questions. Anyone that 
cleans a file in this way should not be touching any bit of the file
&gt; that has a semblance of speech, only the bits that are odiously 
garbage like the &quot;EH O EH AH O EH UR&quot; in between words.
&gt;  
&gt; For example &quot;Is there anyone here that wishes to 
communicate_YES_AH ER EEH AR OOO AR_WE ARE_EH IH AHH EHH_HERE&quot;
&gt; It is much easier for me as a researcher to be able to return to a 
file that I recieved two weeks ago and that I believe may hold some
&gt; relivence to a message I just received and be able to cleanly 
listen to it, without the distraction of the garbage sounds.
&gt;  
&gt; At this stage in real time communication the messages are the top 
priority.
&gt; I do however agree that the untouched version should be retained 
and made available to individuals that make a request 
&gt; for any intelligent sceptical or authenticity challenge that may 
be made, and god knows there are always fanatical 
&gt; sceptics lurking in the shadows awaiting an opportunity to attack 
an unwary or injured researcher. I do not think that 
&gt; our research files should be made available on request by every 
tom dick and harry that is unknown to us and may potentially
&gt; doctor the file to suit their own point and post it as such.
&gt;  
&gt; I have had this happen to me in the past so I believe the 
researcher that receives the request for raw research data should 
&gt; scrutinize the requesting source and use their best judgment 
before handing out any research data.
&gt;  
&gt; These are my thoughts on the subject of cleaning a file.

&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] Editing EVP
&gt; 
&gt;       Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; just a general comment on editing EVP: For scientific reasons, I 
would
&gt; suggest not to edit an EVP message partially, but only as a whole, 
in
&gt; order to rule out any possible suspicion of manipulation. You can 
for
&gt; instance increase the volume or dynamics of an entire clip 
(including
&gt; the experimenter&#x27;s voice), filter or denoise it to make it 
clearer, but
&gt; not cut out individual pieces (supposed &quot;garbage&quot;) to make an EVP 
match
&gt; with what it &quot;should be&quot;. At least, the unedited version should 
always
&gt; be provided along with the edited version.
&gt; 
&gt; But that&#x27;s only my personal opinion which I thought I had to 
express, as
&gt; we should always be able to present our results to a critical 
public.
&gt; 
&gt; Stefan
&gt; 
&gt; -- 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Believe or not Ron, very little editing is involved for these 
files.
&gt; &gt; After my question, i isolate the response section and slow that 
&gt; &gt; section down about 20%. Now i can actually start to hear the 
message 
&gt; &gt; a lot clearer, i also now see a couple sections of just noise 
that 
&gt; &gt; don&#x27;t belong and eliminate them from the mix. You can&#x27;t piece 
these 
&gt; &gt; files together to make something it&#x27;s not, so i keep them in 
true 
&gt; &gt; form pretty much to the original.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hey Steve Forgot to ask...how much editing was needed to get 
this 
&gt; &gt; file? Did you need to take out a lot of garbage between words 
&gt; &gt; withing the message? Ron L
