When the planet was destroyed, our ancestors were stranded here and had to start from scratch.  Fascinating stuff.  Apparently, for centuries the deceased inhabitants of the &quot;mother planet&quot; have been trying to establish communication with us via spirit communication methods--most recently, ITC--to help speed our redevelopment to the previous level.\n  Just thinking, because of your &quot;alien-esque&quot; communications.\n  Ursula\n\nbillliscomb &lt;williscomb@...&gt; wrote:\n          OK, so maybe I went over the top yesterday describing my laptop \nsetup and how I use it � sorry.
