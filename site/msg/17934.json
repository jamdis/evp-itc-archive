I was really new to this  but, from the first day she c=\r\name \nup missing, and the police thought she would be  found ok, I did a ses=\r\nsion \non that first day, and I posted what I got on a couple  of lists.  I =\r\nstill \nhave those files, and date on them on the pc here, I  played them to=\r\n police \nover the phone, and they took the report, in the end every  thing =\r\nspirit said \nwas true.  Everything, right down to the place they found  her=\r\n body, I think \nBruce might recall this, it was his list I think where they=\r\n  were posted, \neveryone was hoping she&#39;d be ok, but as it turns out she wa=\r\ns  killed, spirit \nsaid, &quot;code blue&quot;, gave his occupation, &quot;the tech&quot; and h=\r\nis full  name \n&quot;Raymond Clark&quot; and hers &quot;Annie Le&quot; they said &quot;he buried her=\r\n body in the  wall&quot; \nand that her body would be found.  The girl herself ev=\r\nen came through  crying, \nand had an older Chinese woman (the accent) I can=\r\n locate these  files, if \nyou like I will post them again.  I know this stu=\r\nff is true, I  let the \npolice hear the files over the phone when they were=\r\n taking reports, the  files \nwere clear enough, that the guy heard them, he=\r\n thought it was people in a  bar \ntalking about the what happened, sf \n \n \n=\r\nIn a message dated 7/9/2010 10:33:40 P.M.
