While it is true that they appear to be coexisting in the physical \nuniverse, there&#39;s no reason to assume they are limited by it.\n\nI have dozens of EVP I&#39;ve gotten in the former Manteno State Mental \nHospital in Illinois.  And you know what? Whatever made those EVP&#39;s still \nseems to be crazy. And these were apparently made by spirits who no longer \nhave physical bodies.  So much for the idea of &quot;chemical imbalances in the \nbrain&quot; being the root of insanity! A ghost doesn&#39;t have a brain.\n\nI think Hamlet summed it up the best:\n\n&quot;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in \nyour philosophy.&quot;\n\nI constantly remind myself of that.\n\nZack\n\n\nOn Thu, 13 Nov 2008, Frank Ratka wrote:\n\n&gt; I have no idea what you are talking about, angels? pins?!
