<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Thanks; I don&#x27;t know what it means, alot of this stuff is 
metaphorical---maybe. They used to tell me Bob Lazar was the 
Princess&#x27;s husband, that makes even less sense!

&gt; &gt; I heard something different, but my ears aren&#x27;t always in tune.

&gt; heard &quot;your the wife alley in marriage&quot;, but who knows.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &#x27;Saint Germain is always associated with the color violet, the 
&gt; jewel amethyst, and the Maltese cross rendered in violet (usually 
&gt; the iron cross style cross patee version); he is also regarded as 
&gt; the &#x27;Chohan of the Seventh Ray&#x27;[13]  according to Theosophy, the 
&gt; Seven Rays are seven metaphysical principles that govern both 
&gt; individual souls and the unfolding of each 2,158 year long 
&gt; Astrological Age. Since according to Theosophy the next 
Astrological 
&gt; Age, the Age of Aquarius, will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) 
&gt; Ray (the Ray of Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes 
&gt; called &#x27;The Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius&#x27;. According to the 
&gt; Ascended Master Teachings, Saint Germain is &#x27;The God of Freedom 
for 
&gt; the Earth&#x27;.&#x27;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Much to do with the Purple Princess, and the seven. I don&#x27;t mean 
&gt; to sell others short, I just get a different level, and find 
&gt; regular &quot;this your auntie&quot; type EVPs kinda useless. Mostly I don&#x27;t 
&gt; post every voice I get, just the ones that I thought was 
&gt; outstanding, but no one else hears.
