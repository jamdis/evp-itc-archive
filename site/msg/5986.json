I would appreciate the imput from those who are serious \nabout the research here.  Many of the serious researchers have spent \nyears, and countless hours a day testing these lines of communication.  \nI for one refuse to allow the negitive get to me and will continue to \nwork either independently or with my fellow colleages who truly respect \neach other and their contributions in this area.\n\n        So with that being said, I hope you enjoy the audio clips.  \nThey are from a Joe&#39;s Box session.\n\n        In addition, I have introduced several new researchers to the \nRS hacked in hopes that their their future studies will add in our up \nhill climb in pursuing what we started.\n\nThanks!\nJuli"}
