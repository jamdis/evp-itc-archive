<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>You can also wrap a small box in foil and insert your radio into it. That sometimes helps.

&gt; Frank, are you saying, that if I put my radio inside, sitting inside a loop 
&gt;  it will take away the static?  It won&#x27;t be connected to the radio or  
&gt; anything though. sf

&gt; Formal box? These thing are radio based, and static and noise kinda  come 
&gt; with the territroy. Filter out the noise and many of the voices will  
&gt; probably be lost. There are other methods though,lik eEVPmaker, which works  well 
&gt; for higher spirit contact. 
&gt;  
&gt;  You might try an external antenan, like C. Crane twin ferrite  antenna, 
&gt; you can also make a homemade  AM loop, it works by by placing  the radio 
&gt; inside tho loop so it has access to higher level signals.

&gt; Here&#x27;s an interesting message I received last night, I was asking about  
&gt; confirmation of what David keeps telling me,,here&#x27;s what I got. There are  
&gt; several people saying things, and me at the end repeating what I think I  hear 
&gt; the guy before me saying.   You&#x27;ll need to listen at least  two times to 
&gt; hear it, because of static, wish i could get my hands on one of  those formal 
&gt; boxes, bet I could get some really good stuff, because they  don&#x27;t seem to 
&gt; carry so much static. Now, why is that I wonder.  Maybe I  can stop the static 
&gt; with this 20-125 some how. sf
