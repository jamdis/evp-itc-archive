The description says used 12-\n470, but the picture appears to be of the old 12-469 (no speaker and \nadditional letters at bottom. Older 12-470 only says, &quot;DIGITAL STEREO&quot; \nat bottom, the one pictured says more).\nYou might want to contact the seller to ask what the case actually \nlooks like before you bid.\nIt&#39;s on ebay here:\nhttp://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=320204138852&ru\n\n- Mike\n----------------------\nhttp://www.ufogeek.com"}
