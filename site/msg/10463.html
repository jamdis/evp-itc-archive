It will be real interesting to hear what that radio has to say to you Frank when you get it done. Hope the Honda it came out of wasnt in a fatal crash.

  Hi All;

I found a Honda car stereo at the thrift store this afternoon, I'm 
always on the look out for car radios! This one has a very usable AM/FM 
tuner that does use the analog tuning voltage, so I can use it in a 
box. All radio functions are in the module itself. This radio was 
unusual in that all the pins and connections were labeled. Usually I 
use a scope and voltmeter to id the pins of the module looking for 
operation voltages, which is usually 8 volts, mode pins, such as a pin 
that is for AM or FM, and goes to 8 volts, or sometimes 5 volts for the 
given band. I also look for any other enable voltages, inputs, and 
audio outputs, and the anttena pin(s). Junk yards usually want $10 each 
for junk radios, and many times they just are not usable. This one was 
$3!

What I said about box concerns, maybe just suffice it to say, use at 
your own risk, there probably isn't any danger, and personally I 
haven't encountered anything I would relate directly to the box. 
However, that's not to say I haven't had encounters of an apparent 
demon kind. Just troublesom parasitic entities that once discovered 
quickly leave, not a big deal. I don'[t want to get that serious wiht 
this. Now if everyone that uses the hack box goes bananas....
