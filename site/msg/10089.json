I just choose to \n&gt; share with those whose time has come.  :)\n\nI wouldn&#39;t see an skeptical/critical attitude as something negative.\nSome people just aren&#39;t &quot;believers&quot;, their intellect wants to be\nsatisfied, too. :)\n\nSo being skeptical/critical doesn&#39;t necessarily mean not being a\n&quot;seeker&quot;.\n\nStefan"}
