To me it sounds like the classic under-\nthe-breath EVP.\n\n-Aaron\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;reesclarke_69&quot; &lt;reesclarke_69@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have some new Files that I&#39;m going to post, but I want you to pay \n&gt; attention to one file called &quot;rUherewithUs&quot;  I ask the question and \nat \n&gt; the very end I hear an answer that didn&#39;t sound like it came from the \n&gt; 12-469.  It said &quot;No&quot; under a breath.  I don&#39;t think it was from the \n&gt; radio, but in the Apt with me.  What do you think?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks \n&gt; \n&gt; Rees\n&gt;"}
