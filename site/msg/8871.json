I&#39;m thinking too much has been cut from this one.  Ran a couple sessions with \nit.  I&#39;m not getting anything (not that I get something every time with the other 72- but \nnothing sounds even remotely like word formation with the 56 file.)\n\nMargaret\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the EVP-ITC \n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt;   File        : /Stefan/SJ-Allophones_without_diphthongs.wav \n&gt;   Uploaded by : evpfan &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt; \n&gt;   Description : The same SpeakJet allophones, but without the 16 diphthongs which \nsound like one-syllable words as &quot;I&quot;, &quot;ear&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;air&quot;, etc. (so this file contains only 56 \nallophones, which might be too less). \n&gt; \n&gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Stefan/SJ-\nAllophones_without_diphthongs.wav \n&gt; \n&gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htmlfiles\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; evpfan &lt;yahoogroups@...&gt;\n&gt;"}
