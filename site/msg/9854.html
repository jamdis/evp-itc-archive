Most of these can be spotted as fakes super-easy.  The purple-colored 
shadow ghost drawn into the photo looks like it is floating on top of 
the photograph; and the light blue anomaly drawn between the fence 
slats is horribly done, also.

You are right, a good chuckle they are.  :)

&gt; In the photo section I have just uploaded a few photos for your 
&gt; review.  I would certainly like your honest opinion, for my own has 
&gt; been reached long ago.  They are photos of what are professed to be 
&gt; paranormal in nature, and given the initial viewing I could not 
&gt; fathom for a minute that these could in fact be taken as serious 
data 
&gt; and advertised as true spirit photography.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, I have also listed some articles and background 
&gt; information on this gentleman who proclaims to be highly 
experienced 
&gt; in the paranormal community, with a long list of degrees under his 
&gt; belt.
&gt; 
&gt; The dilemma that I am now presented with is the fact that giving 
the 
&gt; paranormal community is based on a belief system that life after 
dead 
&gt; does in fact exist.  With this false material being presented, we 
&gt; (the paranormal community as a whole) will never be taken 
seriously.  
&gt; What many paranormal investigators strive for almost seems 
&gt; unreachable, and yet those who continue to display false data are a 
&gt; direct reflection of all us in the community tarnishing our good 
&gt; name.  It&#x27;s bad enough that we have do go up against skeptics 
&gt; everyday, but to have self proclaim paranormal experts producing 
&gt; faked evidence, certainly is a disgrace to us all, and should 
apology 
&gt; for his dishonesty and misleading those who ever gave him the 
benefit 
&gt; of the doubt.  
&gt; 
&gt;     They were my photographs, taken with two different cameras. One 
&gt; was an Olympus Trip AF 50, a kind of instamatic type 35mm, and the 
&gt; other was a Yashica J-7. In all photos where the anomalies were 
&gt; captured, the film type was fuji, ASA 400 color film. The photos 
were 
&gt; scanned in at 400 dpi. The digital copies were enhanced to show up 
&gt; better o
&gt; 
&gt; You can pretend you didn&#x27;t see the analysis and the
&gt; accompanying write up, but you would be lying. It was posted on the
&gt; PP site by the Zoellers as well as passed around in an e-mail to
&gt; everyone. You also know that the person asked to remain anonymous as
&gt; he is still active in the service... He also has ten years of
&gt; experience working for a photographic studio.
&gt; 
&gt; The photos are an old argument. If you recall, (and let me refresh
&gt; your memory as you seem to have selective memory since you came over
&gt; to this group) when I gave the originals to John and said I would no
&gt; longer respond to any more questions concerning the photos. As I
&gt; stated then, let john have them analyzed. He could just as easily
&gt; send them to whomever.

&gt;  
&gt;  The articles listed below were uncovered by Melanie K. Hale and 
have 
&gt; come into question regarding the same.  Numbers don&#x27;t lie, I guess 
&gt; people do.  Mr. Roundtree seems to think  that it is right to lead 
us 
&gt; to believe he is something he&#x27;s not, and that all published 
material 
&gt; is his for the taking. 
&gt;  
&gt;   So I did a little math and found the actual percentage of 
original 
&gt; material in each of David Roundtree&#x27;s papers I linked.  I did this 
by 
&gt; opening in word, then selecting &quot;Tools&quot;&gt;&quot;Word Count&quot; and wrote down 
&gt; the total for Words.  Then I deleted all linked materials and did 
the 
&gt; same &quot;Tools&quot; &gt; &quot;Word Count&quot;.  Then I took the second number and 
&gt; divided it by the first number.  Here are the results linked to the 
&gt; original document on David&#x27;s site:
&gt;  
&gt; Analog_or_digital. doc  =  38% original material  62% taken from 
&gt; other sources
&gt;  
&gt; Biofeedback_ Experiment. doc = 10% original material  90% taken 
from 
&gt; other sources
&gt;  
&gt; EVP_Project_ Phase_1.doc = 31% original material  69% taken from 
&gt; other sources
&gt;  
&gt; EVP_Project_ Phase_2.doc = 43% original material  57% taken from 
&gt; other sources
&gt;  
&gt; Orbs-The_Search_ for_the_Truth. doc = 32% original material  68% 
&gt; taken from other sources
&gt;  
&gt; The_Magic_that_ is_Light. doc = 0% original material  100%
