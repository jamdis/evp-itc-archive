My bad, I did not see where he said it was an OEM version.  Just that it was an old one.  (Version 3 is out now and he was giving away Version 2)

This is the third time I have tried to send this message... errr .. I must be getting caught in the spam filter.  ANyway..

Really if you think about it the guy isn't doing anything wrong per se..  He makes claims and offers a disclaimer.  His biggest mistake is what feel is the ethical decision to sell a Radio Shack radio without disclosing that this could be done on their own.  But add in the software and the price then doesn't seem so unrealistic.  But that IJMHO.  Of course his misinformed info about Frank and his boxes is ridiculous but he might actually believe this all to be true.   So in the end again I say Caveat emptor.. 

Also - the software is an OEM version which means he has authorization to 'bundle' the software with products from the makers of Adobe.  I worked for 12 years in the computer industry and to sell/bundle unopened OEM product you must be an manufacturer approved OEM vendor.  He is probably not breaking any laws there either..

So really it's just his inaccurate info about Frank and his boxes which unfortunately happens all the time.  If people want to speak in public about stuff they have no knowledge they open themselves up to all kinds of things.. but with this guy - unfortunately it will just be our ridicule.
