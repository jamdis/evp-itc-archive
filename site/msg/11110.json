We also captured some strange otherworldly sounds in the Wheatfield.  As to your EVPs captured in the men&#39;s room, in my opinion, the Lucifer EVP should be regarded with a bit of suspicion because unless the statement could be concretely substantiated using conventional scientific methods currently at our disposal, there&#39;s no way to determine the veracity of such statements.  However, the very statement itself is negative in nature (insofar as we&#39;re not devil worshippers), and I will be cautious in conducting any more EVPs in the men&#39;s room because it sounds like the spirit(s) is pulling your leg.  \n   \n  Just my opinion, \n  Sharon\n\n\n\n    \n---------------------------------\n  Get trade secrets for amazing burgers.
