We&#39;re trying to establish a clear two-way  \ncommunication with those entities in other realms of life than our  \nown. What you use the radio-sweep technology for is your choice, but  \nbecause of the infancy of this research, it is best, in my opinion,  \nto approach it without an agenda or preconceived notions.\n\nI&#39;ve also got to say that this may not be the area of research you  \nwant to commit to. You say you haven&#39;t slept well since the 1970s and  \nthat the Dead bother you. You don&#39;t sound like you have managed to  \ndevelop a way of dealing with them that leads to less stress on you.  \nThis is very likely going to add to the stress, not relieve it.\n\nThere is inherent beauty in this research, but never come to it  \nthinking that it is a panacea for either you or the &quot;dead screaming  \nfor help.&quot; The reality is is that it&#39;s a hard, long slog for a few  \nshort messages. It&#39;s hours of sessions and reviews--a lot of which is  \nvery tiring, for reasons that may be natural and &quot;supernatural.&quot;\n\nFrank can&#39;t &quot;do the world a favor.&quot; He&#39;s not hiding any big secret to  \nlife, the universe, and everything. No one here is. And anyone who  \nclaims otherwise is fooling both you and themselves.\n\nHard truths, but they need to be said.\n\nAnn\n\nOn Feb 29, 2008, at 3:19 AM, Victoria Manion wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Well,\n&gt; If you actually have something...it is wrong for you to hide it...\n&gt; I haven&#39;t slept well since the 1970&quot;s...\n&gt; There are crimes to be solved...the dead are screaming for help...\n&gt; Sometimes, all forensics needs is a direction...\n&gt; Frank...if this is actually your name...jeese...do the world a  \n&gt; favor...do the right thing and show us how to help them...if we  \n&gt; help the dead...we help thousands of the living.\n&gt; But understand what you do...the religious right will hate you.\n&gt; It goes against everything &quot;they&quot; say about the human soul.\n&gt;\n&gt; purplespacefriend &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wanting to be less negative sounding, I can&#39;t rule out producing the\n&gt; boxes some time in the future.

As far a people taking what you say to be negative,\n&gt; well if they do oh well they will get over it. I personally don&#39;t\n&gt; think there are any experts, which is my opinion for what it is worth\n&gt; and I am sure I will catch hell over my statement. I for one can not\n&gt; say or confirm who I am talking to, nor will I ever be able to (well\n&gt; maybe when I&#39;m dead) if they are in fact spirits from the other side\n&gt; or other life forms from different planets. I do however know that I\n&gt; love the communication who ever they are and pretty much have to\n&gt; leave it at that. I think this is what makes it so fascinating to\n&gt; me, that so much of the communication we receive is unknown in\n&gt; origin. You have taught us that we should take this as it comes, and\n&gt; not hold too much truth to some of the messages.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You for one designed each an every box\n&gt; differently, having its own unique features about them. From white\n&gt; noise generators, to random, to lunar, etc.. You adapted them as you\n&gt; went, so if anyone has experimented the most in this field, I would\n&gt; say it certainly would be you. The never ending days and hours you\n&gt; have spent creating these devices truly surpass all of us combined\n&gt; time in the research end, so I don&#39;t think I have to say anymore\n&gt; there.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I can only speak for myself, but I feel that your contributions\n&gt; are extremely important and are needed. You have helped and touched\n&gt; peoples lives many you will probably never know of or meet. It is\n&gt; because of your desire and constant dedication with your building of\n&gt; perfection that you have allowed us an opportunity to experience what\n&gt; you do knowing that there is more out there than just us, in our\n&gt; selfish world of our.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hell I&#39;m calling it a good day when I can turn my TV remote on,\n&gt; so I know I certainly count on you for your experiences in obtaining\n&gt; the best communication!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Juli\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Frank Sumption &lt;purplealiengirl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I was going to make comments about box use, but so far\n&gt; it always falls on deaf ears, and gets taken as being negative, so\n&gt; screw it, the &quot;experts&quot; can hash it out. What would I know, I just\n&gt; make the damn things?! BTW, for the above reasons, not making boxes\n&gt; fror anyone.
