Gosh, I just wanted to meet Frank in person, and literally see what he
has =
come up with.
That's all. I wasn't suggesting that he jump on the celebrity=
 train.
I would like to see an actual "Frank's box".
I don't know how Darkn=
ess Dave got Frank to go in the first place, but I
am sure
he won't go if h=
e doesn't want to.....
