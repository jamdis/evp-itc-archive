I have\na question in regards to a dream a friend had...\n\nThe dream was vague but in it a woman in her low to mid 30&#39;s is\ntalking about her father who has figured out a way to run Frank&#39;s Box\nthrough a laptop. End of dream. When the dream was relayed to me, my\ngut response was &quot;Oh! They are using the wi-fi antennae&quot;. Now, don&#39;t\nget me wrong. I&#39;m about as technical as a shoe string but the dream\ncame across as a strong message. Is this even possible? \n\nThe only real &quot;visual&quot; of the dream was as the voices are coming\nthrough, they are showing up on the laptop as well... as if Adobe\nAudition or some other sound editing program is being used in\nconjunction."}
