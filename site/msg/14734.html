Makes me wish I'd have gone into electronics and programing instead of  
nursing and psychology,

I am a ham radio operator and I remember one receiver that I had that was a 
 "black box" and completely software controlled. It was a Ten-Tec RX-320  
receiver, and it received LW/MW/SW in AM/CW/SSB. It was a fun little radio,  
but using the software to control it, there were so many other options  
available. Nice bandscope with point-and-click tuning. Selectable user defined  
filters, you name it. Another neat feature was the fact there there were  
virtually dozens of third-party software releases for operating it, usually  
catering to the ham/swl crowd.

My thoughts are that perhaps a similar  computer-controlled ghost box could 
be made. You could use the software to  define sweep style, and it would be 
endless possibilities. You could have an  RNG controlling the random sweep, 
and linear sweeps could be programmed to  emulate triangle, sawtooth, ramp, 
etc...

In addition, you could have  on-the-fly recording options, and you could 
apply various filters to clean it  up. Visual waveform indicators, and file 
reverse option for reversing the  file. Heck, you could even introduce your 
preference of noise source (white,  pink, brown) into the signal. Perhaps an 
optional echo chamber with built in  mic for output. All of these things 
could be software controlled, and I am not  to sure they couldn't be implemented 
via software package for existing radios  out there such as the ICOM 
PCR-1000 or the TEN-TEC Rx 320 or Pegasus. Really  all of these things are a 
result of the software interface, so it is  completely possible, but it would 
have to be someone with a lot more tech  experience than me to make it a 
reality. Any  takers?

thanks
Andy
