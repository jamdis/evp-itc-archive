Hey everyone,
  I have something I would like to share and get some thoughts on it.
  I have been doing EVP and just started trying to figure out this thing with the webcam doing loopback. I have been experiencing spirits since i was a kid, like most of you. Lately, i have NOT been getting any EVP's out of my house like before. I know that they are here though, with all the "funny" things that have been going on. However, here the quirky <ness> in it. They have been doing things to show my husband that they are here, one day he saw a "dog" that could not of gotten in or out of our yard. As, we have a privacy fence and a paddlelocked gate. Yesterday, he was taking a shower and i was asleep still, he heard me call him and he responed, i "said" honny, he said yes, it was MY voice, they were mimicking, then he dismissed it when i didnt respond, the  a few minutes later, "I" called him again and he responded with yes? but he looked out and no one was there. He told me about this last night, lol he was a little nervous starting the conversation lol, as he doesnt
 like being involved with "spirit work", i told him that I wasnt awake till after he got out of the shower, because when i woke up, i saw him in a towel going into the bathroom, i thought he was going into the shower but he was already done. So, this all bothered him alot and i dont know if it was the experience or the conversation or they were keeping him up all night, but he didnt sleep much last night. 
  I am wondering why they would be presenting themselves to him. That i cant get them on evp anymore. OFCOURSE no one will know the answer to thier reasoning. Just need to get this out there and get some thoguhts on it lol.
  Ohhh yeah, the miimicking me thing, isnt the first time theyve done it. One of my evp's along time ago, one of them mimicked me right over me talking on the tape. I forgot to add that in.
