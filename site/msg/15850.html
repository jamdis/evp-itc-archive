Ive been recording for quite a while with members of a small group and thou=
ght I would share a few of=A0my files from those sessions. They dont use a =
franks box or sweep tuning method but is done with the experiments of Marce=
llo Bacci in mind, or DRV. Sometimes I like to record adding the water meth=
od in addition.
=A0
I dont expect everyone to hear anything as I do, we all=
 have different speaker setups and different hearing ranges, but if you do =
hear one then that's nice. The group seeks harmony and raising energy level=
s which quite often increases the amount of feedback given. We dont record =
when we are sick or our minds are on other things, and the intent is simply=
 to enjoy each others company, learn and maintain our focus. 
=A0
I like ho=
w Ernst Senkowski put it that there are many languages and each language us=
es a different spoken word to convey a thought. He used table for an exampl=
e. Depending on the language spoken it could be table, tabla, tabela, lijst=
, tabelle, and so on. No matter what the spoken word is the "thought" of th=
e table is still the same. Voice begins with a thought.
=A0
I recently had =
the pleasure of getting together in person with two members of the group an=
d we recorded while we chatted. The level of spirit energy surrounding us w=
as amazing and spirit voices would chime in and add to the conversation in =
a voice that was as loud as our own. Ive posted some of those files as well=
 over in my=A0esnips evp section. 
=A0
Heres a few attached files I recorde=
d during our online group session. Spirit often speaks in bursts of energy =
no matter which method you use.
=A0
Have a great day!
