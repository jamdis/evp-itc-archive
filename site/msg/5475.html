<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I agree Frank, i don&#x27;t do the protection thing.  Yet, i did have a 
couple problems here personally.  I guess for people who believe in 
it i guess it couldn&#x27;t hurt, as for my problems i can&#x27;t say it was 
from not doing a protection prayer but i also can&#x27;t say it was.  
Another paranormal toss up for each researcher to decide i guess.  
That&#x27;s why i never tell anyone what to do, there is no right and 
wrong way to do anything in this field.  People just have to draw 
conclusions on their own and get results in the way that they seem 
fit.  And than report, and not tell people for a fact that it should 
be done that way.  Each person with their own ideas will eventually 
put all the pieces to this paranormal puzzle together.

&gt;  Bad idea! In my opinion. You just create fear with that crap, and 
&gt; fear feeds itself. Once again, you will create what you expect to 
&gt; get. If you use protection BS, you&#x27;ll have convinced yourself that 
&gt; there is something to be affraid of, and so you will tend to creat 
a 
&gt; thoughtform to fulfill that expectation.

&gt; &gt; everyone,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have written up the short protection ritual I use before every 
&gt; &gt; session, I have been using it for quite a while now and have had 
no 
&gt; &gt; problems with dark heads other than the occasional curse word.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I recommend that all researchers experienced and new use this or 
a 
&gt; &gt; similar protection ritual before every box session if you are not 
&gt; &gt; already. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; hey it&#x27;s better to have it and not need it , than need it and not 
&gt; have 
&gt; &gt; it!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I will post it in the files section in a folder marked 
&gt; &gt; &quot;protection ritual&quot;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks guy&#x27;s
&gt; &gt;
