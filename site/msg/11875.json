My\ngirlfriend was using the 469 with headphones. It started to spook her\na little and she gave me the box. I put in the headphones and didn&#39;t\nhear anything out of the normal radio scan. Then I heard footsteps\ncircling me. I started looking around and asked if anyone else was\nhearing them. I then got attacked by an entity in the cemetery. It\nfelt a lot like a schoolyard bully circling you before he hits you,\nand then a big rush of  energy. I can&#39;t really describe the feeling. \n\nThen, the other night I was on a separate investigation and was in a\nbathroom. I was hearing water dripping, but when I checked the\npossible sources they were bone dry. \n\nIs it possible that these noises can come clearly through the 469? I\ndo not have any psychic ability I know of. They are very real, and are\ndefinitely happening, not being imagined. Maybe it has something to do\nwith the headphones? I cannot explain this. Have any of you had a\nsimilar experience?"}
