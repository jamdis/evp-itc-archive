The tuning is swept across the entire band, AM or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; FM, the resulting bits of speech, music, and noise are used by the=\r\n enitites&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as a raw material to build their voices from. T=\r\nhe sweep can be linear,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; random, or manual, and it does no=\r\nt have to cover the entire broadcast band.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This is one me=\r\nthod and device for providing the raw audio, and if you&#39;re&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; tesitng to see if it&#39;s just broadcast fragments, consider this-the concep=\r\nt&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is the same as EVPmaker, EVPmaker runs on a computer, t=\r\nhe entities&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; manipulate that raw audio *inside* the conmpu=\r\nter, and if you think stray&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; RF is going to get *inside* t=\r\nhe hard drive and mix with the audio file&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you have no clu=\r\ne how any technology works.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Testing is=\r\n irrelavent! It&#39;s not the device, it&#39;s the user. The messages&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; received are for the user, and rarely does anyone hear the same thing =\r\nas the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; original listener.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  You test it by use, you judge it by what comes thro=\r\nugh and what it means&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to you, you can&#39;t play the sound sn=\r\nipets to a panel of numbnuts(objective&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; listeners)) and ex=\r\npect to get an unbiased/honest test. No two people hear&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; t=\r\nhe same, so an &quot;objective listener&quot; is an insult to most people doing this&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; work.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  I know, I&#39;m be=\r\ning harsh.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Frank-S&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On Thu, Jan 7, 2010 at 8:20 AM, rasterer &lt;rasterer@yaho=\r\no. com&lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://mc/compose?t=\r\no=3Drasterer@...&quot;&gt;http://mc/compose? to=3Drasterer@ ...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; &gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hey all, I&#39;ve seen lots o=\r\nf people posting their perspectives and results&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and s=\r\nuch about the Frank&#39;s Box. In order to help develop some good testing&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt;&gt; for it, I think the first step is to get a common or offic=\r\nial consensus or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; statement on what it is the Frank&#39;s =\r\nBox is claiming to be doing. This might&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; seem a silly =\r\nquestion, but I think it&#39;s important to make sure any testing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t go off in some irrevelevant direction.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Frank - or anyone - what is a good official statem=\r\nent on what the Frank&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; box can do?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n=\r\n \n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-1623963128-1262899730=:52443--"}
