I hadn&#39;t heard she is sick or anything . . . what&#39;s going on with her? I&#39;d like to send out Prayers her way! Thanks.  =Judy=                                                   \n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psi_research&quot; &lt;vilhellm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sarah is such a brave visionary. Jen & I met her at the Atlanta AA-EVP \n&gt; meeting a few years ago and she was surprised that attendees wanted \n&gt; their photos taken with her and asked for her autograph. It&#39;s folks \n&gt; like her and others in this field, including some of the participants \n&gt; of this forum, that keep the research moving forward.\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;ll make sure Sarah is in our thoughts during this holiday season. -\n&gt; Bill\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As most of us know, Sarah Estep, was the founder of the AA-EVP--the  \n&gt; &gt; route by I, and many of us, first got to the place we&#39;re at today.  \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve heard from a friend of mine who is also of that generation of  \n&gt; &gt; EVP tapers, that Sarah&#39;s condition is deteriorating. I&#39;d like to ask  \n&gt; &gt; all of you to send positive thoughts her way, as she was always a  \n&gt; &gt; very gracious lady who was more than helpful to many, many people \n&gt; who  \n&gt; &gt; were interested in taping. I bought my first equipment from Sarah&#39;s  \n&gt; &gt; husband and benefited greatly from her wisdom, always given freely.  \n&gt; &gt; She will be remembered as giant in this field.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please think of her kindly this Christmas Eve.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ann\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;"}
