Thanks, too for the update on her.  =Judy=\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Guy&quot; &lt;yzzzguy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I just received this note today from the AAEVP:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;AA-EVP founder, Sarah Estep, was taken to the Hospital on Christmas\n&gt;  day.  The doctors have given her just a few days to live.  Her family\n&gt;  hopes to bring her home to care for her until her transition. If you \n&gt; want to be kept up to date on this please email us back at ----------,\n&gt;  otherwise we will post general information in a second broadcast.  Our\n&gt;  prayers are with Sarah for an easy crossing. We know that there will be\n&gt;  many who will be waiting to greet her.  Our prayers are also with her\n&gt;  family to help them through this difficult time.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Tom and Lisa Butler&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Guy\n&gt;"}
