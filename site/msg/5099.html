<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I fully agree with Bruce&#x27;s comment about not leaving a Box running 
without supplying input or asking questions. After I build each 
MiniBox, my original practice was to leave it running overnight as a 
burn-in to insure that if there was an early failure, it would 
happen before the device was shipped. After a while I noticed the 
Boxes would begin cursing or calling me by name repeatedly. By then 
I realized that anytime the Box is activated, entities will attempt 
to communicate within a minute or so. They seem to sense that 
a &#x27;portal&#x27; is open so crowd around and try to get the operators 
attention.

I have since changed my procedures and have limited my tests to 
power-up and then alignment, and indicate verbally to 
whoever/whatever is present that this is a test and I am not trying 
to communicate, but to just insure that the device is working 
properly before sending it to its new owner. The incidence of bad 
language has totally disappeared and the Box is actually remarkably 
quiet during this process. As I final test I do a very short test so 
confirm that communications are being made, then thank the entity 
and sign off.

As I have stressed repeatedly, this device, whether a MiniBox, 
Frank&#x27;s Box, RS Hack, Joe&#x27;s Box, or whatever, it NOT a toy and 
should be treated with respect. Until more is known, sessions should 
be handled with care and documented properly. I am attempting to 
gather and rewrite my operations guidelines and welcome input from 
everyone. These guidelines are device-independent. I want to insure 
that all persons who read them are using the device properly and 
with the correct attitude.

&gt; Nick,
&gt;  
&gt; My advice as a long time researcher is not to just turn the box on 
and leave it running 
&gt; unless you intend to do a session and give your friends on the 
other side that are working
&gt; extremely hard to send you the communication your undivided 
attention.
&gt;  
&gt; It&#x27;s kind of like calling someone on the phone and when they start 
a conversation you decide to
&gt; put the phone down and focus your attention on other things.
&gt;  
&gt; There are other researchers that feel that there is nothing wrong 
with this practice and do it on occasion
&gt; But I have come to the understanding that it is deemed 
disrespectful and while you may be listening with 
&gt; one ear as you do something else, you will hear a loud curse word 
or nasty statement, that is their way 
&gt; of getting your attention back. I have gotten numerous messages 
about the difficulty of the attempts for 
&gt; them to communicate so when I turn the box on it gets my full 
attention. just some experienced advice.
&gt;  
&gt; As for them telling you to close the portal, it could have two 
meanings. Sometimes they refer to box that
&gt; is turned on and in use as a portal for the simple reason that 
each time we turn a box on to communicate 
&gt; it opens a direct open link between our realm and theirs so in 
essence it is an open door for anything to pass in or out.
&gt;  
&gt; that is why when I end a session I always ask my technician to 
bring back any spirits that may have come through the 
&gt; portal during the session and I ask for conformation and 10 times 
out of ten will get &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;OK THEY ARE BACK&quot;
&gt;  
&gt; also they may have meant since you had the box running and where 
not doing a actual session to shut the box so 
&gt; that they could go and not have to protect the open connection 
from any negative entities that where able cross through the open
&gt; portal.
&gt;  
&gt; A few researchers have been receiving numerous messages about the 
number 7 within the past month. The only known 
&gt; significance that the number 7 has in evp research is the 7 
entities that controlled communication back in the eighties and 
nineties
&gt; during the spiricom and luxembourg era. To receive this number in 
messages so often and by more than one researcher, odiously
&gt; holds some importance which they have not been able or are not 
ready to convey.
&gt;  
&gt; If you need any help or have any questions please feel free to ask.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hey,Anyone have any odd problems in the morning with using it. I 
am sitting here checking my email so i just thought i&#x27;d turn it on 
and... not check my email. Anywho.... Then right at about 6:20 i 
heard a voice say &quot;Nicholas Etheridge please turn off the dsfnlsd&quot; 
not quite sure what word it used... possibly portal. I just thought 
it was weird. Also under all of the jumble and this voice speaking i 
heard a deep male voice almost chanting &quot;seven&quot;. Not sure if I 
actually heard this or its the want to have an excuse to stay home 
and not take the HSAs.Anyway.. just curious if anyone has gotten 
heard this or if they know something I don&#x27;t about using the box in 
the morning.Peace,Nick
