did someone not say their technician is Steven? Sometimes I feel like
I'm losing it.

I ask if my technician's name is David (which is also the name of
someone else's guide), which is info I got from Bruce. I hear,
"Steven." followed by, "It isn't." The I get the names "Nicholson
Lawson," something I can't understand, and then "Ben Wilson."
Nicholson is interesting to me because it is a family name. I'm not
sure if Nicholson Lawson is one name or it is a Nicholson and a
Lawson. For some reason, I got the feeling the name Ben Wilson was a
complete name.

Thoughts?
