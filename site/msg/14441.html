That is also not to say that all EVP or ITC are personal, psychic messages,=
 just the one's that noone else gets, but you know in your gut what they me=

  See scrying gives you away to g=

s, that is directly from the astral. Psychics are gifted in a way that they=
 can control their filters. Most of us have no clue how to do this.

  But =
this would coincide with Franks and other's theory about some messages only=
 making sense to the person recording them, and that no matter how clear th=
ey are to you, others may not hear them.

    Just because the messages are coming from your subconsciou=
s does not mean you aren't interacting with actual, intelligent souls. Thin=
k of your subconscious a link to the astral plane. The subconscious is just=
 the scientific word for it. We are all part of the astral, the collective =
