I was going to buy some plywood, or \nMDF to make a couple box cabinets, but found these wood boxes \ncheaper. I make the enclosures out of whatever I can get/make cheap, \nas store bought enclosures can be kinda pricy. \n\n Frank-S\n\n\nom, psfponies &lt;psfponies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Werent your early boxes wood?

Of course the front \npanel is proving to be a challenge, I wanted it wood too, so I&#39;m \nusing 1/8 inch mahogany plywood--ever try to drill speaker gril \nholes without splintering the wood!? I don&#39;t know why they wood(pun \nintended) say it&#39;s on time.
