&gt;   Yes like a magnet for them. People ask me when did I become 
interested in &quot;them&quot; and rather than answer my reply is usually its 
more like when did &quot;they&quot; become interested in me.
&gt;    
&gt;   We&#x27;d love to hear your evp you get during your experiment. I 
checked my files and tho there are many hello&#x27;s said many different 
ways I have never had a &quot;yes hello&quot; to my knowledge.
&gt;    
&gt;   As for the itc pics, I guess some could be considered &quot;scary&quot; LOL 
but I have never had any fear about any of this. I&#x27;ve dealt with the 
paranormal so long that to me its just normal. Tho when I first 
started the itc pics I would get hundreds of eyes staring back at me, 
it was a bit creepy. Then during evp they mentioned the pics and 
said &quot;echo six is ready we have to look happy to you&quot; so I did more 
itc and got alot of smiles and teeth. Creepier LOL. In later evp 
someone said &quot;I told you were looking happy&quot;.
&gt;    
&gt;   They have also shown me pics/artwork of the &quot;living&quot;. 
&gt;    
&gt;   I find it all quite fascinating.
