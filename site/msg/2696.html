Hiya Frank
   
  I can hear those, tho I hear a few added words in there like "thier reality is we can talk-tell them" 
   
  But overall I hear them as you do. 
   
  I think sometimes static helps, many of the voices I have gotten are made up from the static itself. It is distracting for some peoples hearing but I have grown accustomed to it so it can be seen as an enhancement at times. When I first started there was so much static it was overwhelming to hear thru it, but now I just hear it as a multilayer and sometimes that layer holds its own messages.
