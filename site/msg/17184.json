[3 Attachments]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Where I took an older non-digital- -mechanically tuing radio and\n&gt; convereted to varactor tuning so I could use the linear sweep voltage. In\n&gt; the LinearSweep- FM, at 6-7 seconds &quot;tell him there&#39;s no spiders&quot;. It&#39;ll\n&gt; sound better withe speaker in a cabinet. In Manual-FM-! at 3 seconds\n&gt; &quot;there&#39;s a bomb-Yes&quot;, but no where or when, or any needed info. In Manual-AM\n&gt; at the end &quot;give this box to Charli(?)&quot;, and at 5 seconds &quot;seven--I answered\n&gt; you--It&#39;s ah tedious&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The Quija box is waiting for glue to dry, so working on this thing.\n&gt;\n&gt;  F-S\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nThanks!\n \n F-S\nOn F i, May 21, 2010 a 12:02 PM, Ch is Salois ch issalois@...> w o e:\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nSounds good F ank.
