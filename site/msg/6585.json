I had\nthis happen a few day&#39;s ago and when I repeated the question my tech&#39;s\n&gt; mike and lisa both said &quot;AGAIN&quot; they start to lose patience\nsometimes, but you have to remember to them we must be like dealing\nwith kindergarten children.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: ghostchasingfool@...: Thu, 31 Jan 2008 15:18:30\n-0800Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Re: New File\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Jeremy:\n&gt;                You may also want to try and ask the questions\nquickly (I often times write them down prior to a session).  The\nreason being I have noticed that many people drag the questions or ask\nmore than one question prior to getting a response.  Please note that\nin my research I have on occasion spoken over them and get not the\nimmediate response because I was too busy talking.  I have even gotten\nfrom my tec David to (&quot;I&#39;m  Talking) which was funny cause anyone that\nknows me, knows I love to gab, lol.  I have attached to clips so you\ncan see what I am talking about.  The first one David tells me that\nbasicly I needed to listen and not speak, for he was not done.  The\nsecond, Joel is asking a questions and the question seems to go on and\non, only to have David say &quot;Joel Speak Up&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt;                   In addition, I have also gotten as many as 3\nspirits responding to your question at the same time.  I believe Bruce\nand Steve have experienced that on more than one occasion.  Maybe they\ncould post or attach one of these files for an example.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;                   They know whats going on, and they will comply\nwith you and guide you along the way.

I do understand\nwhat you are saying though about doing it one questionat a time. I&#39;ll\nbe sure to do that from now on. Thanks for the help.Jeremy--- In\nEVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday&lt;paranormalinvestigating@&gt;\nwrote:&gt;&gt; &gt; Jeremy,&gt; &gt; There are quite a few answer or messages just in\nthis clip.&gt; My suggestion is to go over the clip a question at a\ntime.&gt; &gt; Put the whole recording into your editer and go to the\nbeginning&gt; of a question and then save the question and the preceeding\nsignalup to the next question.&gt; In a file of it&#39;s own. Go over the\nrecorded data following thesingle question and look for specific\nanswers.&gt; to that question. If there are any save that answer to a new\nfile inthe editer and slow it or clean it a bit so it is\ncompehencible.&gt; then paste it back where it belongs in the question\nfile. You shouldnow have the question and answer in one file.&gt; Save it\nand label it with the question and answer as one file.&gt; &gt; I hope you\nunderstand that explination, if not fire back somequestions and I&#39;ll\ntry to clarify.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; Bruce Halliday &gt; &gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@: ecuyler@:\nThu, 31 Jan 2008 02:46:17+0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: New File&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\nAfter listening again, I think the &quot;tells me to&quot; part is\nmorethanlikely just a radio station.Jeremy--- In\nEVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com,&quot;ecuyler&quot; &lt;ecuyler@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Just posted a\nnew file on Esnips.

It&#39;s a little over\n30&gt;seconds long. &gt; &gt; Bruce, if you still want to hear all of\nthissession, I will put it&gt; all on Esnips. Just let me know. There\nisquite a bit more to it&gt; than just this one clip. It&#39;s amazing all\nthethings that came through.&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s a little background on the\nfile. Iasked two questions. The&gt; first was, &quot;Is the US governemnt\nusing ITCresearch?&quot; The second,&gt; &quot;How is the US goverment using ITC\nresearch?&quot;I hear these things in&gt; this order: &quot;Yeah it is, just stop\nit, juststop, you need help,&quot; and&gt; something toward the end that I\ncan&#39;t quitemake out.
