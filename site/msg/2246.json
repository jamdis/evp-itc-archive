You&#39;re right, that could be a nightmare.  I agree some of those images are definitely interesting, I showed my son the &#39;weird cat&#39; and asked him what he thought it was and he said &quot;well mom, that is a robot cat!&quot;  lol, that lady that looks like she is taking a portrait- that was definitely weird- mostly because it looks like she doesn&#39;t have eyes?  She has spots for eyes but if you blow it up a little it looks like no eyeball- something definitely very strange about that one!\n\nFrank Sumption &lt;franks-boxes@...&gt; wrote:          \n I still don&#39;t know if all of the images are paranormal, but there&#39;s some that are probable.
