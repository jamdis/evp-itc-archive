He mentioned that when he first got his box it called Franks name repeatedly. That isnt the first time I saw someone say that. I know quite a few of you now have been given a box or even constructed your own versions like Steve based on the work Frank did. \n   \n  I have heard a couple of peoples results here but I would like to hear more so I am going to ask if you have one you comment on your use of it and how you think the results went as well as maybe post a few sound files that I can hear. I have spent years listening to the box voices but its refreshing to hear others results and see the variations as with any other evp method, it differs by user/location. LOL you know who you are and I wont name you all but I do hope you will share with us.\n   \n  Thanks!\n  Misty\n\n       \n---------------------------------\nBe a better Heartthrob.
