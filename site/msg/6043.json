I  I should be receiving my mini box in about\ntwo weeks.  I would like to list my proposed method of documentation I\nwill be using for my sessions and get your feedback if you will.\nFirst the mini box will be fed to a Zoom H4 so both the box and my\naudio can be recorded in very high bit rate on two separate channels.\n The entire session will be recorded on a Sony DSR-200a dvcam recorder\nwith an audio feed from the H4.  I will also have my data logger\nrunning and that captures my tri-field meter data and the magnetic\nfield surrounding the area, the air temperature and the gamma\nradiation level present.  This is all saved and displayed on a monitor\nand will also be fed to digital video recorder. Furthermore I will\nhave my thermal imager watching the session and also record that video\nfeed.  All feeds will be time code synchronized and captured. In the\nend the entire session will be saved to a DVD for study and archiving.\n I will also of course keep copious notes on the session in a log book\nand include my personal feelings and emotions from the session.\n\nI know this may seem over the top  and not at all necessary for a\nsession to be successful, but I like to have as much data at hand to\nboth rule in and out all possibilities.  The sessions should also make\nfor some interesting shows.\nThanks for your time and for letting me in the group."}
