  File        : /Jim&#x27;s RR-DR60 EVP&#x27;s/Brandon_Dillard_Brandon_Hyslope-BOOSTED -AUDIO-evp.wav 
  Uploaded by : clockdryve &lt;clockdryve@...&gt; 
  Description : At a location on 5-25-10 I call 2 churches....on a hill with 2 churches about 300ft both sodes of me. One is old and shut down. The location is new to me with 3 recording sessions now. This day was a VERY good day with many EVP&#x27;s on both DR60 and the B7 recorders. I increased the amplification in the area of the EVP&#x27;s voice to help hear it otherwise MOST would not be able to find it. I found out today after just listening again that a little girl also says &quot;okay&quot; just before the main evp speaks.
