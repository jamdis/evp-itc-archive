<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>&quot;Your horoscope for November 29, 2010

 Things are looking up for you today, and you will find that your emotions
are much more in control than usual. You have an extra strong connection to
nature, and your tender, nurturing side is shining through. Let people know
that you are not the aggressive, stubborn person that many have come to
think of you as being. Let them see the other side of you as well.&quot;  LOL!

See, I only pretend to be an old grouch.

 F-S
