There is \nno clicking what so ever on either band. The Am band is so quiet I \nhad to look at the radio to make sure it was still sweeping! I tried \nit out this morning for a bit but didnt get anything. I hope they \nlike the new radio.\n\nKay\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itcdeadpeople&quot; &lt;ITCdeadpeople@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for the update, Kay.  I&#39;ve also noticed varying sweep times \nbetween AM & FM on other \n&gt; models.  Not sure if the actual rate of sweep differs, for just \nthe amount of channels there is \n&gt; to be swept on one band versus another, so it takes longer to \ncomplete one full cycle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Margaret\n&gt; \n&gt;"}
