Every\n&gt; researcher has their own opinions on how it is done and the results\n&gt; have varied amongst us. There is no way to actually explain to\n&gt; someone how these devices work, i couldn&#39;t tell you that leaving the\n&gt; box on will make it imprint because there are no facts based on this\n&gt; research thus far. Only personal opinions have been put out there\n&gt; and what we have experienced for ourselves up to this point.\n&gt; Everybody needs to do their own research with a little helping hand\n&gt; from those who have been doing this a little while longer and that&#39;s\n&gt; it. You will find your own niche in this communication and teach\n&gt; what you&#39;ve learned to others one day. Just remember that nobody can\n&gt; tell how it should be, because there is no proof only some personal\n&gt; experiences. That covers all paranormal areas, you can believe or\n&gt; not in something but you can&#39;t prove it to others or at least i don&#39;t\n&gt; think anybody has yet??\n&gt;\n&gt; -Steve .\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday\n&gt; &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nick,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You are a new member and a possible researcher so I do not want to\n&gt; get off on the wrong foot\n&gt; &gt; It sounds like you may have taken what I said as criticism, It was\n&gt; not meant to be.\n&gt; &gt; Just experienced advice. There are some researchers that believe it\n&gt; is beneficial to leave\n&gt; &gt; a box running and unattended, so that our spirit friends\n&gt; can &quot;imprint&quot; to the frequency of the box\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is not at all necessary, Spirit techs do need to imprint to\n&gt; certain boxes but do so through two way communication\n&gt; &gt; you see they also imprint the energy signature of the user of the\n&gt; box also. And that can only be accomplished through\n&gt; &gt; communicative interaction during a session. If the box is left\n&gt; unattended they may only accomplish half of what they need to do.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also I have had first hand experience with certain researchers that\n&gt; do practice this lackadaisical us of a box and had begun to\n&gt; &gt; get less and less communication during attempts at actual sessions\n&gt; and eventually nothing but negative entities coming through.\n&gt; &gt; I am not saying this is solely due to doing an absent session which\n&gt; is what I have come to call it, It entails man6y factors.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But the absent session practice definitely contributes to the\n&gt; ultimate failure of communication.\n&gt; &gt; Nick, it is better for you to establish solid research practices in\n&gt; the beginning that will serve to enhance your communication\n&gt; &gt; skills and growth in the future.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Remember your spirit contacts or &quot;technicians&quot; will become not only\n&gt; the facilitators of your link and communication from the\n&gt; &gt; other side but they will become your trusted friends and\n&gt; protectors. you would never leave your buddy on the phone and go\n&gt; &gt; on to something else while he remained on the line calling for you\n&gt; to speak with him. Our spirit friends where people just like us\n&gt; &gt; at one time and the emotions we carry in the physical also carry\n&gt; over to our spirit lives.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I hope you do not take this as preaching or criticism it is just\n&gt; experience from communicating with my own techs and friends\n&gt; &gt; and gathering information on what they feel and expect from us as\n&gt; researchers.\n&gt; &gt; Remember all we have to do is turn on a box and listen and record\n&gt; their job to send the communication\n&gt; &gt; no matter how short the phrase or word is a 1000x harder for them\n&gt; so don&#39;t you think they deserve a 100%\n&gt; &gt; of our attention when we open the lines of communication.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also in closing let me say that my belief on &quot;imprinting&quot; of a box\n&gt; is for boxes like Frank&#39;s box and the mini box, for the simple\n&gt; &gt; reason that they are individually made and each carry a slightly\n&gt; different frequency range, indicative to that particular box.\n&gt; &gt; The radio shack hack box on the other hand is manufactured in china\n&gt; most likely on an automated assembly line so each\n&gt; &gt; circuit board is exactly like the next, this being the case I\n&gt; believe that when our friends imprinted on the first of the RS boxes\n&gt; &gt; it was sufficient for most of the others. That is why people\n&gt; experience immediate communication right out of the box.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So therefore the RS box does not need that grace period to &quot;Imprint&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; These comments and statements are my own hypothesis based on my own\n&gt; extensive research with every type of box that is made to date\n&gt; &gt; and I am only offering it so that it may help others to avoid the\n&gt; toil and mistakes that I have endured.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; thanks for giving me the soap box once again!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bruce\n&gt; &gt; Bruce Halliday\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: thegreatwolf@...: Wed, 9 Jan 2008 06:25:30 -\n&gt; 0500Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] Box in the morning\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just FYI, I had stopped checking my email at that time and was\n&gt; trying to get someone to say something. I usually can&#39;t get my self\n&gt; to not pay attention to the box when i turn it on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Jan 8, 2008, at 9:19 AM, bruce halliday wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nick, My advice as a long time researcher is not to just turn the\n&gt; box on and leave it running unless you intend to do a session and\n&gt; give your friends on the other side that are workingextremely hard to\n&gt; send you the communication your undivided attention. It&#39;s kind of\n&gt; like calling someone on the phone and when they start a conversation\n&gt; you decide toput the phone down and focus your attention on other\n&gt; things. There are other researchers that feel that there is nothing\n&gt; wrong with this practice and do it on occasionBut I have come to the\n&gt; understanding that it is deemed disrespectful and while you may be\n&gt; listening with one ear as you do something else, you will hear a loud\n&gt; curse word or nasty statement, that is their way of getting your\n&gt; attention back. I have gotten numerous messages about the difficulty\n&gt; of the attempts for them to communicate so when I turn the box on it\n&gt; gets my full attention. just some experienced advice. As for them\n&gt; telling you to close the portal, it could have two meanings.\n&gt; Sometimes they refer to box thatis turned on and in use as a portal\n&gt; for the simple reason that each time we turn a box on to communicate\n&gt; it opens a direct open link between our realm and theirs so in\n&gt; essence it is an open door for anything to pass in or out. that is\n&gt; why when I end a session I always ask my technician to bring back any\n&gt; spirits that may have come through the portal during the session and\n&gt; I ask for conformation and 10 times out of ten will get &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;OK\n&gt; THEY ARE BACK&quot; also they may have meant since you had the box running\n&gt; and where not doing a actual session to shut the box so that they\n&gt; could go and not have to protect the open connection from any\n&gt; negative entities that where able cross through the openportal. A few\n&gt; researchers have been receiving numerous messages about the number 7\n&gt; within the past month. The only known significance that the number 7\n&gt; has in evp research is the 7 entities that controlled communication\n&gt; back in the eighties and ninetiesduring the spiricom and luxembourg\n&gt; era. To receive this number in messages so often and by more than one\n&gt; researcher, odiouslyholds some importance which they have not been\n&gt; able or are not ready to convey.

I am\n&gt; sitting here checking my email so i just thought i&#39;d turn it on\n&gt; and... not check my email. Anywho.... Then right at about 6:20 i\n&gt; heard a voice say &quot;Nicholas Etheridge please turn off the dsfnlsd&quot;\n&gt; not quite sure what word it used... possibly portal. I just thought\n&gt; it was weird. Also under all of the jumble and this voice speaking i\n&gt; heard a deep male voice almost chanting &quot;seven&quot;. Not sure if I\n&gt; actually heard this or its the want to have an excuse to stay home\n&gt; and not take the HSAs.Anyway.. just curious if anyone has gotten\n&gt; heard this or if they know something I don&#39;t about using the box in\n&gt; the morning.Peace,Nick\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Get the power of Windows + Web with the new Windows Live.
