Been thinking and decided that we are not wrong in our beliefs.  If we  can 
help find a missing child as so many do with $30 shack hacks, than where is 
 the harm and the threat.
 
Science spends billions of dollars each and every year to find a cure for  
cancer with no results.  I'm talking about a $30 radio that may help and  
has.  Seems like we have the upper hand in the matter.  Just because  our 
methods are not accepted as the norm, does that mean that it serves no  purpose.
 
If society spent billions of dollars on ghost box research every year, we  
wouldn't even be having a conversation.
 
p.s.---- Modern science has found a cure for cancer, they just can't reveal 
 it because they are making a fortune off of treatments.
 
p.s.s.----Thanx RJ for posting that link for that show.....Why are you here 
 anyway?
