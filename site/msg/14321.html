I'm sorry if I hit some kind of nerve, but it was really just a=
 simple question, and I'm sure you can understand why the rumor would arous=
e curiosity. There's no need to head anything off on my account, and as you=
 said, he can speak for himself if he likes. Though, because of the tone of=
 your response, I hope he does address it now, to clear up any ideas which =
your reaction might have engendered.
