Thanks,Lance- -- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com, &quot;babiarz3&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;babiarz3@&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt; Lance, &gt; I think you make my point very well. \n&gt; \n&gt; You say you don&#39;t know Chris&gt; personally but that it seems I am the \n&gt; \n&gt; one wearing rose colored&gt; glasses. I do know Chris. Even when Frank \n&gt; \n&gt; is upset he says &quot;Chris is a&gt; nice guy&quot;. Chris&#39; statements and \n&gt; \n&gt; beliefs have never changed while&gt; others can be wishy washy \ndepending \n&gt; \n&gt; on the day. The view that Chris&gt; does not want any one to research \n&gt; \n&gt; the box besides him is BS. The fact&gt; is that prior to Franks \noriginal \n&gt; \n&gt; yahoo group disappearing, Chris&gt; provided a link directly to the \n&gt; \n&gt; schematics. In his presentations he&gt; would tell people that the \n&gt; \n&gt; schematics were available online. Yet,&gt; because he is against mass \n&gt; \n&gt; production, it MUST be because he wants the&gt; research all to \nhimself. \n&gt; \n&gt; Rose colored glasses or a case of only seeing&gt; what is wanted? This \n&gt; \n&gt; is a fact compared to perceptions and opinions. &gt; &gt; Fact: Almost \neach \n&gt; \n&gt; and every user of a box or it&#39;s facsimile have&gt; stated that lower \n&gt; \n&gt; energy/evil/ dark... entities have spoken via the&gt; device. &gt; &gt; \nFact: \n&gt; \n&gt; Rick Moran states that the groups for testing will include&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; believers, skeptics, senior citizens, (now here&#39;s where it gets \nscary)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; CHILDREN and HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS!&gt; &gt; - Couple the last two facts \n&gt; \n&gt; together and do the math. One mentally&gt; unstable child or youth \nhears \n&gt; \n&gt; the box tell him it is right to kill or&gt; rape or .....&gt; &gt; Fact: \nRick \n&gt; \n&gt; Moran in his article about Tools being only as good as the&gt; users \n&gt; \n&gt; states, &quot;...know how they work before you go into the field.&quot; &gt; So, \n&gt; \n&gt; in one place we are still testing, in another we are sending them&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; out in the field to be tested by groups that include children and \n&gt; \n&gt; high&gt; school students. The good thing is that a nice little online \n&gt; \n&gt; tutorial&gt; is available with some warnings. Phew! As long as this \n&gt; \n&gt; can&#39;t come back&gt; on anyone I guess all the bases are covered \n(tongue \n&gt; \n&gt; in cheek). &gt; &gt; Fact: Chris has been the primary tester of the \ndevice \n&gt; \n&gt; in the field.&gt; That fact deserves consideration, at the very least. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fact: Last night, a radio personality on Spooky South Coast \n&gt; \n&gt; claimed&gt; that after he engaged the dark voices coming through the \n&gt; \n&gt; box, he was&gt; physically attacked.&gt; &gt; Fact: Frank has stated that in \n&gt; \n&gt; the beginning Chris was the only one&gt; who understood how the box \n&gt; \n&gt; should be used.&gt; &gt; Fact: Some people who have received boxes from \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank discovered they&gt; were not able to use them although they \nworked \n&gt; \n&gt; fine for Frank. These&gt; same people would not return the boxes to be \n&gt; \n&gt; looked at.&gt; &gt; Fact: After death communications have been received \nvia \n&gt; \n&gt; both computers&gt; and phones. If it were simply the devices and not \nthe \n&gt; \n&gt; users would we&gt; not have millions of these communications? &gt; &gt; \nFact: \n&gt; \n&gt; Mark Macy states that in an after death communication&gt; \ncommunication \n&gt; \n&gt; with Konstanin Raudive in which Mark asks &quot; Can you tell&gt; me about \n&gt; \n&gt; the equipment you use to produce a perfect, almost perfect&gt; voice \non \n&gt; \n&gt; earth?&quot; Konstanin replies &quot;Well it depends on your reception-&gt; or \n&gt; \n&gt; mainly your psychic reception.&quot; This fact backs up the theory that&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; effective users are limited.&gt; &gt; Fact: In another after death \n&gt; \n&gt; communication Konstanin addresses contact&gt; fields saying &quot;...but if \n&gt; \n&gt; there is dissonance in the form of fears,&gt; doubts, and animosities \n&gt; \n&gt; the contact field becomes cloudy...that&#39; s when&gt; negative spirit \n&gt; \n&gt; groups close to earth in vibration can break into&gt; existing bridges \n&gt; \n&gt; with troubling results.&quot;&gt; &gt; &gt; And so yes, maybe I wear rose colored \n&gt; \n&gt; glasses. However, I am inclined&gt; to believe that I have done my \n&gt; \n&gt; research and have availed myself of&gt; quite a bit of information \n&gt; \n&gt; regarding this topic. &gt; &gt; With that said, I am holding an online \n&gt; \n&gt; event where people can ask&gt; Chris the questions they want as long \nas \n&gt; \n&gt; they are formed in an&gt; intelligent manner. If you are interested in \n&gt; \n&gt; attending the event you&gt; can find the information on the front page \n&gt; \n&gt; of my site at&gt; www.thepsinetwork. com I felt it unnecessary to \nattempt \n&gt; \n&gt; to &quot;bridge the&gt; gap&quot; as well between speculation, insinuation and \n&gt; \n&gt; fact. &gt; &gt; Sincerely,&gt; Babs&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In EVP-\n&gt; \n&gt; ITC@yahoogroups. com, &quot;Lance Oliver&quot; &lt;orbhunterx@ &gt; wrote:&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; \nHey \n&gt; \n&gt; Bab,&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even though I&#39;ve newly begun to chime in here, it seems \n&gt; \n&gt; to me that &gt; &gt; some people are guilty of wearing rose colored \n&gt; \n&gt; glasses, as far as &gt; &gt; Chris is concerned.
