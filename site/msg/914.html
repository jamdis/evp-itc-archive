<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>It&#x27;s a difficult concept for most, first just finding out there is something 
&quot;after&quot;, and wrapping the head around that. EVP, and ghost hunting might be 
ok to start with for most, as I did, but I quickly found there was more, and 
it was a lot more interesting.

I would like to make my systems available, and find a way to stress that 
it&#x27;s best used at home, you don&#x27;t have to chase ghosts and spirits, they 
come to you, and have no travel restrictions. I&#x27;ve even got voices from 
&quot;ghosts&quot; supposed stuck at a haunting site, and come through on my box, in 
my basement. I think most of the &quot;Ghost Hunter&quot; stuff is Hollywood, and 
seems to be very profitable.

Think I&#x27;m gonna just lay low for a while. See if any Frank&#x27;s Box clones come 
out.
