Frank   Just curious, is the guy who is working on a patent seeing this as something useful for EVP or is his focus on other applications?  You statement should motivate some here to keep testing the SJ and speech-text concept rather than awaiting a patented product that could take years....and years.
   
  Also, I for one have been impressed by the tech skills of a number of folks in your group here and appreciate them coming out to expose their knowledge from time to time.  Ron L

working version, and I've seen/heard it. Apparently there's patent 
stuff involved, but it's supposed to be coming out. 

To me, there seems to be a few on this group that want to be the big 
experts, the go to guys, and make alot of claims. Just keep in mind 
that the real brainiacs in the field tend to stay off groups for this 
reason. 

It's curious that someone that claims to be complete ignoramous when 
it comes to technology claims to have been researching a highly 
technical aspect of this research for several months. I'm trying not to 
be the bitch, but the claws are coming out.
