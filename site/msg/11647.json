We were only able to\nuse it for a couple of minutes before the batteries died, but I did\nfind a couple of files. One I heard on the radio, the second I don&#39;t\nknow if it was an EVP or if it came from the radio.\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/EVP-ITC/files/Aaron%27s%20Files/12-469%20New%20Model/\n\nThe Files are named 8-1-2008 Ghost Box EVP 1.mp3 and 8-1-2008 Ghost\nBox EVP 2.mp3\n\n-Aaron"}
