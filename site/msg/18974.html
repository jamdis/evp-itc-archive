<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I read on the Butlers ATC site a few months back that they had a group
testing the boxes and they would post their findings soon.  Are these the
results that the Butler&#x27;s came up with from this test, or are these results
from an early experiment?  I just went to their site and couldn&#x27;t find
mention of it, but right on their homepage there was this:

&quot;Everyone is invited to use EVPmaker to name the secret object.&quot;

Sounds familiar, huh?  I wonder if RJ is part of their group.

&gt; Wow, never knew that the Butlers had supposedly tested your box, along with
&gt; having no contact with you, and dubbed it or the method nothing. That is an
&gt; eye opener for me.
&gt;
&gt; The association (ITC) now run by the Butlers used to be named, AA-EVP, I
&gt; believe, so named by the creator of the group, Sarah Estep but they felt the
&gt; name should be changed, why, who knows, never thought there was a problem
&gt; with the original name.
&gt;
&gt; I am glad you posted this bit of information; I see some people in a
&gt; different light now. I agree with you regarding the money aspect coloring
&gt; the actions of some &quot;experts&quot; in the field, not everyone of course but
&gt; enough to be cautious. They aren&#x27;t fooling anyone but themselves in the long
&gt; run.

&gt; I know ther are real scientists out there that would probably study this
&gt; stuff if it weren&#x27;t for being ridiculed by the dumb ones. Unfortunate that
&gt; there are people that have put themselves in positions of authority, such
&gt; as
&gt; the Bulters, that claim they had a team of &quot;more qualified listeners&quot; test
&gt; the boxes and they found nothing to it. Never asking me anything about the
&gt; box, or the theory behind it. Always these experts that know better. Some
&gt; of these people have $$ interest in keep real knowledge hidden.
