&gt; The HAARP facility is inactive and has been so since April 5, 2011. I found 
&gt;  out over the weekend through some of my contacts that there hasn&#x27;t even 
&gt; been  anyone on site for quite a while. How could they be causing any of  this?

&gt; David the tech says that HAARP and Fema are &quot;trying to cause mass  death&quot; 
&gt; and &quot;they are trying to cause an earth quake, but all they can do is  create 
&gt; all the massive rain&quot;  David says, &quot;God won&#x27;t let them create an  madrid 
&gt; quake&quot;  at least i hope that&#x27;s what i understood him to  say.  &quot;all haarp is 
&gt; getting is the rain&quot; they have been trying to play  God,&quot;  David the t. says 
&gt; that if i tell you guys, &quot;they won&#x27;t believe  it&quot;  but, i got a big mouth so 
&gt; i have to tell you to be careful, many  people have loved ones that got 
&gt; killed or hurt last night.  You guys  know that what&#x27;s going on in the world is 
&gt; not the norm.  sure this may  be spring and season for rain, but, not at 
&gt; this level, somethings  a  brew and it&#x27;s not coffee. sf
