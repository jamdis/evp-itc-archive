&gt;  The only probelm I have run into time after time is I get a 
voice/message that seems perfectly clear, and no one can hears the 
damn thing! Very frustrating!! So EVP is useful only to the 
experiencer, I guess. Yet another reason why I hesitate to make more 
boxes, there&#x27;s no way to determine if it works, or is it just 
imagination/perception. Ya get just enough to string you along!

&gt; I don&#x27;t agree with that Frank I don&#x27;t believe they give just enough 
to string us along, I believe we are understanding just enough so 
that they keep trying.

I think we advance a little each time we initiate any form of 
communication with the other side. It&#x27;s like a baby you have to crawl 
before you can walk, walk before you can run. I think that they set 
the pace for advancing not us and are giving us what we need a little 
at a time to go from crawling to walking at this point. 

From some of my messages I believe the ones that no one but us can 
hear are the most important of all, because I know when I record a 
message that is clear to me and no one else can hear it, it makes me 
go back and reexamine the message and helps me sometimes to better 
understand it.

I know that you know what I&#x27;m talking about because you have been to 
the promise land and returned with the gift of knowledge.
