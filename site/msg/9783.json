Guess they got the EVP bug! The bids up to \n$257.00 (reserve not met yet)\n\nI do have a question for you Bruce you state in your ad &quot;THIS DEVICE \nRETAILS FROM THE MANUFACTURER FOR 499.00&quot;\n\nWhich model Mini box is this I only see two on the site one for $399 \nand the crystal enhanced for $449.\n\nKay"}
