<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I use a 12-469, although I just bought a 12-587 because I&#x27;m so tired of the clicking; I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s going to work as good or not, as I just modified it last night and haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet.  Currently I have the 12-469 plugged into a Tascam Porta05 ministudio 4-track tape recorder, along with a Sure microphone.  So far I&#x27;ve found doing sessions during the daylight hours on clear days seems to work the best; an entity once told me to do the sessions at night, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well then -- at least, if they talk then, I can&#x27;t hear it for all the noise.  Although I&#x27;m a newbie, my one piece of advice for you would be to listen back to the tape or digital recorder files VERY closely, because for me, 90% of the messages can only be heard upon review, not during the actual session itself (maybe because some of it is true EVP?).

I would say, if you can get your hands on a small radio to hack, you will have no problem getting something to happen.

&gt; &gt; I heard from my dad today finally!  I knew it was him, because when I asked how many people we were talking to today, the answer was, &quot;Just just talk to me!&quot;  My dad was always impatient, always interrupting people, so this was exactly what he would say.  Then he answered with his name to confirm.  When I asked if my dad&#x27;s friend Gordy was there, the minute I mentioned his name, I swear I heard &quot;asshole.&quot;  It&#x27;s possible my dad wasn&#x27;t getting along with Gordy, because Gordy had a tendency in life to grate on my dad&#x27;s nerves, so this might be something he&#x27;d say.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Then I asked for him to say my mom&#x27;s name, and he responded by saying her name in a way that was exactly how he used to say it when he was teasing her.  It wasn&#x27;t his voice, it was radio voice, but it was the same inflection he used.  When I asked what relationship he had to us, there was a long sentence I couldn&#x27;t make out, something about me growing up, and then, &quot;We know Jeffrey,&quot; which is my dead brother&#x27;s name -- followed by &quot;daughter.&quot; 
&gt; &gt;      = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =      Hi there! How did you do this? What kind of recorder are you using or do you have a Frank&#x27;s Box???  I&#x27;d like to be able to do the same thing!!  Thanks!  =Judy=  Please tell us how &amp; when (eve.?) you do this? It might help me!
&gt; &gt; I asked if it was my dad, and a clear answer:  Yes, followed by two very loud, clear, &quot;I love yous.&quot;  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But the best part was this:  I asked if he had a message for my mom (who was sitting there, too), and he said, &quot;Love you.  Don&#x27;t wait for.  Me.  You will be.  Much.  Older.  I love you.  Love.  You.&quot;  How awesome is that?!!!!  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If this wasn&#x27;t my dad, it was certainly a kind, loving entity, that&#x27;s for sure.  Just wanted to share with you all.  (Now I really need to figure out how to get these tapes into my computer!!!)
