I was very surprised to hear \nthat response directly after my question.  There was no cutting or \nenhancement, except trimming it out of the original audio and \nnormalizing it to 60db after direct recording it.\n\nMy guess would be that whatever agenda is being driven by \nthe &quot;voices,&quot; they may already have enough people in place (or even \nin mind) with what they wish to do.  The reason I say this is \nbecause it seems many of the people are receivng the same techs \nthrough these devices.  I personally believe I received responses \nyesterday from &quot;Mike & Lisa.&quot;\n\nYet, I still wonder if they are referencing the time being short, \nwith respect to whatever is coming.  Maybe they mean the thinning of \nthe veil between spirit and physical??.\n\nHow many technicians are out there?  How many have been identified?  \nI know mine have been male-female sounding...others?\n\nLC\nhttp://www.AngelsGhosts.com\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, Lisby &lt;lisby@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Wow.
