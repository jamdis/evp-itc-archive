<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>They keep going and going with weird, vague predictions. When i was tesitn
gthis thing I was hearing &quot;them&quot; talkng about wormwood, so I asked--a
mistake I think. In the wormwood video it sounds like something about July
&quot;July it&#x27;s over my 15th&quot;, and the AM vid starts out &quot;July-something&quot;. Not
what I heard when playback from the phone itself.

 While I&#x27;m asking when, a guy is saying &quot;my watch says years&quot;, or is &quot;500
years&quot;? orrrrr, my friend in tears?, orrrr, I bring ya tears?
 This is one of the &quot;why the hell do I bother&quot; moments. It sounds better in
person, and this one is almost immune to the usual AM interference here.

F-S

They keep going and going wi h wei d, ague p edic ions. When i was esi n g his hing I was hea ing &quot; hem&quot; alkng abou wo mwood, so I asked--a mis ake I hink. In he wo mwood ideo i sounds like some hing abou July &quot;July i &#x27;s o e my 15 h&quot;, and he AM id s a s ou &quot;July-some hing&quot;. No wha I hea d when playback om he phone i sel .
