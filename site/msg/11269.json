Purchasing would be better...we have a few &quot;hot \nspots&quot; in Muskegon county that we would like to try further research on. \n&gt; Last Saturday evening a small bunch went to a really hot cemetery and there we picked \nup&nbsp;on a woman who was&nbsp;just walking through the area as I was in the bushes \nrelieving myself. And no camera was even handy!! &nbsp;OY!! LOL&nbsp;&nbsp; We \nwanted to try some EVP&#39;S but the rain was coming down so hard that it was a bit \ndiscouraging to say the least.\n&gt; Al\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ____________ _________ _________ _________ _________ _________ ___ \n&gt; Enter for Your Chance to WIN*\n&gt; The TotalBeauty. com Summer Spa Sweepstakes!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Enjoy 5 GB of free, password-protected online storage.
