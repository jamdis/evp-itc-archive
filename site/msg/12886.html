&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I don&#x27;t know what to do, is the second time that a spirit gets in my
&gt; cell, just to insult me, then &quot;she&quot; gets away, then others come to
&gt; bring wonderful messages, are some spirits envious of us ? I think its
&gt; the same spirit that have insulted me, its a woman, don&#x27;t know who she
&gt; was or is, but she had handled to get in to insult me. Do I have to
&gt; tell her to go away and leave me alone ? or do I have to insult her
&gt; back ?
&gt;
&gt; any ideas ?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Neli
