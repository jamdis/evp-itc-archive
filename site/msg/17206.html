<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>The never ending quest for a perfect tuner, while varnish dries on other
boxes. It would help if I really understood how the voices are formed, how
the sound is actually manipulated. The sound quality of the tuner is vital,
othere things I&#x27;ve tried, like echo chambers and adding in tones seem to be
of little help. I&#x27;m not an engineer, all I know is do the sweep thing and
&quot;they&quot; talk. I don&#x27;t know how to dail up an enitity, and I&#x27;m not wise enough
to ask questions.

 There&#x27;s some out there that seem to think the box is imperfect and they
wait fo rthr next stage. All that is a symptom of our siociety, expectingthe
next programmed advance. I think some are not being told how great they are,
so the box must not be working correctly. Not so much here on these groups,
just people I&#x27;ve run into in the past.

 As above, so below! I&#x27;m easily dismissed on this level, and I&#x27;m not sure
this isn&#x27;t true on high as well.
