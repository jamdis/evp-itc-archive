I use a natural white noise when I record and get good results. The water from the fishtank is pumped thru a charcoal filter creating a waterfall effect and the running water has always been a benefit to my sessions.\n   \n  However when using background sounds like water or music I usually find its best to not blast the sound and to turn the recording mic down halfway 50% loudness so it doesnt drown out the voices. I also find that most of the material is located within the recording at a much slower speed. For mine the more audible voices are usually located at -74 percent slowed (if using audacity to slow it) and sometimes at -30 when they have alot to get across.\n   \n  So try adjusting the sound volume and the recording mic volume and see if that helps. And dont forget to try slowing it down and listening to it in forward and reverse.\n   \n  Good luck!\n  Misty\n\nJaime Machado &lt;xtal32768@...&gt; wrote:\n          Hi,\n\nI just entered the group and I&#39;m interested in EVP.
