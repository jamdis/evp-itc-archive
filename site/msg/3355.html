<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Bill,

Yeah, it was from a old style 470 i was able get my hands on.  A 
floor model was all that was available at my local radio shack.  I 
was getting a pretty crappy AM signal because of the rain, but it 
works.  I try to leave the files barely touched to leave the 
authentic value for listeners.  I can get plenty 469&#x27;s, i can always 
pick one up and send it to you.  The original files from saturday 
were from the FM from the 469, that mod took less than 5 minutes to 
do.  The 470 old style is probably your best bet if you can find it 
because it has the built in speaker, but it&#x27;s really hard to find.  
It&#x27;s not the black one, it&#x27;s grey.

&gt; These are very clean. Are these from the HackShack radios? -Bill
&gt; My local Radio Shack doesn&#x27;t have the 469 or 470.
