co, and you have flulike symptoms, ask your doctor if you need treatment or=
 to be tested. Allergies won't cause a fever. And run-of-the-mill stomach b=

        The US has not reported any swine flu fatalitie=
s yet.  That doesn't mean there won't be any.  But the reason that so far t=
hat flu has been less serious in the US is speculated to be due to better t=
reatment and earlier prevention.
