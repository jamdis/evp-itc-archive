<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Yo Bruce,

That&#x27;s because I&#x27;m in the larval stage... My higher self invariably 
conflicts with my animal nature. Please bear with me as I evolve. 

;-)

Someone wise once told me - 

&quot;Don&#x27;t give offense or take offense. Don&#x27;t compete, cooperate!&quot;

Lance

&gt; It&#x27;s sure nice to be recognized for a job well done!LMAO!Actually, 
I&#x27;m motivated to assist all of us by being a voice of calm, reason, 
and compassion among a stormy sea.Granted, there are some serious 
issues that are going on, sides being drawn, ect... Yet, does anyone 
really think this effort at communication is best served by allowing 
it to become just another battle ground? Peace,Lance--- In EVP-

I would like to appologise for voicing my negative opinion about 
chris &gt; moon on this group. I seldom lose my temper but enough is 
enough with &gt; this guy.&gt; &gt; My appology is for bringing negative 
energy to the group, especially &gt; when I have been preaching harmony 
and posotivity. I guess that&#x27;s what &gt; makes us human.&gt; &gt; Sorry all 
lets try to keep our negativity in check.&gt; &gt; Bruce&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
