We&#39;re all agreed about\npursuing this research in a positive frame of mind. If you have a\nnaturally positive one, or if you need to do something ritualistic to\nremind yourself that you are in a positive mindset, it really doesn&#39;t\nmatter. The same end is obtained.We&#39;re all okay, no matter which way\nwe get to the positive vibe. As John Lennon said, &quot;Whatever gets you\nthrough the night, its alright.&quot;\n\nYou&#39;re both splendid researchers and you are both right, HMO.\n\nAnn\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@...m, Frank Ratka &lt;warrior18eii@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Bruce,\n&gt; \n&gt; No problem, you are entitled to your perspective and opinion. I\nreally don&#39;t see anywhere in my post, a stance being made beside my\nagreeing with Sumption. Since you mentioned it, I have a problem with\npeople who consider themselves to be advanced researchers in ITC\ntelling others that there are things you need protection from in this\nfield. I have seen this fear mongering over the many years I have been\ninvolved with my research and the research of colleagues and\nassociates and it has never helped anyone. Are there negative entities\nout there that want to influence you and distract you? Sure there are!\nProbably just as many who want to help you and they have been there\nsince the beginning of each of our lives.\n&gt; \n&gt; The rule of thumb in dealing with those negative forces is to not\nfollow their messages. If the message is basically negative then give\nit no merit and carry on. No ritual needed! Now if you want\ncredentials I can give you my &quot;paranormal resume&quot; and let the pissing\ncontest begin. All you need to know about me is I know enough to know\nthat the more I learn and experience the more I realize I have a lot\nto learn. Ego you say, not at all. \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Frank R.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; From: bhali333 &lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt;\n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Monday, January 14, 2008 8:29:15 AM\n&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] For Frank R. this is long but I think worth the read\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;             Frank,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Let me say at the onset this is not meant as an attack and I will not \n&gt; \n&gt; get into a pissing match over it, but I did feel I needed to address \n&gt; \n&gt; it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I promised myself that I would not post a response to any one \n&gt; \n&gt; person,only to a subject in general, but I will have to break that \n&gt; \n&gt; promise on this one.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think your response to the ritual protection post was egotistical, \n&gt; \n&gt; careless and uninformed. That was the response I would expect from a \n&gt; \n&gt; close minded sceptic that had no real experience in this field.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; As a researcher in the paranormal in general you should know that \n&gt; \n&gt; there is a very real and present danger from darker entities, \n&gt; \n&gt; especially in the field of box research that is still in its infancy \n&gt; \n&gt; and our knowledge is not advanced enough using this method to be so \n&gt; \n&gt; hap hazard about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; All are entitled to their own opinion as far as the way they go about \n&gt; \n&gt; their own research but to advise that protection from the negative \n&gt; \n&gt; means nothing and to do it in an open forum where there are \n&gt; \n&gt; impressionable new individuals that are just entering into this \n&gt; \n&gt; research is very careless on your part.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Some researchers here including Steve and myself among other have \n&gt; \n&gt; recorded files with messages that tell us that the communication \n&gt; \n&gt; process is being hindered at that time by what we refer to as \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;dark heads&quot; and our spirit contacts actually use that term. they \n&gt; \n&gt; have also told us when asked why communication was so bad that it was \n&gt; \n&gt; being blocked by negative entities. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I only one of a few that have gotten this exact communication. So \n&gt; \n&gt; there is a real threat from negative energy or entities.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Plus through research we have found that it is possible for entities \n&gt; \n&gt; to travel back and forth between our realms during an open box \n&gt; \n&gt; session. If you listened to numerous files Steve and I have posted \n&gt; \n&gt; asking our friends mike and Lisa on the other side to insure that all \n&gt; \n&gt; and any spirits that may have traveled through please go back and \n&gt; \n&gt; have gotten conformation from them every time.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If it is possible for an entity to travel through the portal that a \n&gt; \n&gt; box MAY produce then it stands to reason it is possible that it can \n&gt; \n&gt; be a dark entity.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; As far as fear goes, I agree wholeheartedly, fear definitely feeds \n&gt; \n&gt; the negative. And that is my point. The protection ritual does not \n&gt; \n&gt; create a relative tangible barrier, it is simply a metaphoric symbol \n&gt; \n&gt; of putting your mind in the right place so as not to feed this \n&gt; \n&gt; negative energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; And the protection we receive from our tech/guides on the other side \n&gt; \n&gt; in my belief is very real, I believe they do actually run \n&gt; \n&gt; interference for us as far as negativity goes and the part of the \n&gt; \n&gt; ritual where we invoke their help is just a form of respect and \n&gt; \n&gt; acknowledgement that they are constantly watching out for us.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; this being said, Of course everyone will adhere to their own beliefs \n&gt; \n&gt; as far as this subject is concerned. I just felt that your response \n&gt; \n&gt; was a little strong and came more from the attitude that I also \n&gt; \n&gt; suffer from that is to say &quot; negative spirit yeah bring it on&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; But that is not a logical thought out approach to an existing concern.\n&gt; \n&gt; So make the ritual available for anyone that wants to use it and the \n&gt; \n&gt; experienced information to go with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; My most important concern is the welfare and teaching and eventual \n&gt; \n&gt; success of new researcher and this research as a whole.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;!--\n&gt; \n&gt; #ygrp-mkp{\n&gt; border:1px solid #d8d8d8;font-family:Arial;margin:14px\n0px;padding:0px 14px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mkp hr{\n&gt; border:1px solid #d8d8d8;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mkp #hd{\n&gt;\ncolor:#628c2a;font-size:85%;font-weight:bold;line-height:122%;margin:10px\n0px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mkp #ads{\n&gt; margin-bottom:10px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mkp .ad{\n&gt; padding:0 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mkp .ad a{\n&gt; color:#0000ff;text-decoration:none;}\n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;!--\n&gt; \n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc{\n&gt; font-family:Arial;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc #hd{\n&gt; margin:10px 0px;font-weight:bold;font-size:78%;line-height:122%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc .ad{\n&gt; margin-bottom:10px;padding:0 0;}\n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;!--\n&gt; \n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg {font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean,\nsans-serif;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg table {font-size:inherit;font:100%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg select, input, textarea {font:99% arial, helvetica,\nclean, sans-serif;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg pre, code {font:115% monospace;}\n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg * {line-height:1.22em;}\n&gt; #ygrp-text{\n&gt; font-family:Georgia;\n&gt; }\n&gt; #ygrp-text p{\n&gt; margin:0 0 1em 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-tpmsgs{\n&gt; font-family:Arial;\n&gt; clear:both;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vitnav{\n&gt; padding-top:10px;font-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;margin:0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vitnav a{\n&gt; padding:0 1px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-actbar{\n&gt; clear:both;margin:25px\n0;white-space:nowrap;color:#666;text-align:right;}\n&gt; #ygrp-actbar .left{\n&gt; float:left;white-space:nowrap;}\n&gt; .bld{font-weight:bold;}\n&gt; #ygrp-grft{\n&gt; font-family:Verdana;font-size:77%;padding:15px 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-ft{\n&gt; font-family:verdana;font-size:77%;border-top:1px solid #666;\n&gt; padding:5px 0;\n&gt; }\n&gt; #ygrp-mlmsg #logo{\n&gt; padding-bottom:10px;}\n&gt; \n&gt; #ygrp-vital{\n&gt; background-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:2px 0 8px 8px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vital #vithd{\n&gt;\nfont-size:77%;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:bold;color:#333;text-transform:uppercase;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vital ul{\n&gt; padding:0;margin:2px 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vital ul li{\n&gt; list-style-type:none;clear:both;border:1px solid #e0ecee;\n&gt; }\n&gt; #ygrp-vital ul li .ct{\n&gt;\nfont-weight:bold;color:#ff7900;float:right;width:2em;text-align:right;padding-right:.5em;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vital ul li .cat{\n&gt; font-weight:bold;}\n&gt; #ygrp-vital a{\n&gt; text-decoration:none;}\n&gt; \n&gt; #ygrp-vital a:hover{\n&gt; text-decoration:underline;}\n&gt; \n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #hd{\n&gt; color:#999;font-size:77%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov{\n&gt; padding:6px 13px;background-color:#e0ecee;margin-bottom:20px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov ul{\n&gt; padding:0 0 0 8px;margin:0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov li{\n&gt; list-style-type:square;padding:6px 0;font-size:77%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #ov li a{\n&gt; text-decoration:none;font-size:130%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor #nc{\n&gt; background-color:#eee;margin-bottom:20px;padding:0 8px;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad{\n&gt; padding:8px 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad #hd1{\n&gt;\nfont-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;color:#628c2a;font-size:100%;line-height:122%;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad a{\n&gt; text-decoration:none;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad a:hover{\n&gt; text-decoration:underline;}\n&gt; #ygrp-sponsor .ad p{\n&gt; margin:0;}\n&gt; o{font-size:0;}\n&gt; .MsoNormal{\n&gt; margin:0 0 0 0;}\n&gt; #ygrp-text tt{\n&gt; font-size:120%;}\n&gt; blockquote{margin:0 0 0 4px;}\n&gt; .replbq{margin:4;}\n&gt; --&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;      \n____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and \n&gt; know-it-all with Yahoo!
