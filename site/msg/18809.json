This recording\nstarted out braodcast out of the radio station analog, traveled to the radio\nin analog RF, was down converted in the radio chip in analog circuits, and\nthe audio was recorded on magnetic tape. The EVPs are clearer from tape,\nthat&#39;s why I use it, cuz digital sucks! I&#39;d use tubes if it wasn&#39;t for the\nhigh voltage power supplies and larger transformers. Some worship this high\ntech crap, which is killing the planet. They over estimate it&#39;s true value.\n\n F-S\n\nLess han a minu e o FM, you can hea mo e eedback in his-- eedback is om being in echo chambe mode.
