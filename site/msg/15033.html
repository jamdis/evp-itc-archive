Yes, because soundwaves by nature are measured through our environment. As =
RJ corrected and reminded me they are pressure waves that are subject to th=
e thickness of our atmosphere. Meaning they cannot be transmitted at th spe=
ed of light. What they can do is be embedded in a carrier signal to be demo=

Tell me wher=

 soundwaves cause pressure waves that our ears read as vibration and our mi=

A mistake that a lot of people make is thinking that there =
are two different types of energy at work when it comes to sound waves and =
electromagnetic waves. The only thing that seperates them is frequency and =
power. Radio waves are radio waves because they occupy a certain block of t=
he electromagnietic spectrum. Sound waves exist on that same spectrum just =
farther down with much longer waves. Soundwaves and subsonic waves can pene=
trate almost anything because of their wavelengths. The shorter the wavelen=
gth the more ways we can shield against them.
=A0
Think of microwaves. Thes=
e are also a type of radio and telemetry transmitting wave but the waves al=
so have a physical effect on our environment by causing molecules to speed =
up, which creates heat. A little lower than this is IR or infrared it too c=
an cause physical objects to heat up but usually it just causes molecules t=

Here is some food for thou=

=A0=

It was me and another girl teammate=A0present in the room. I picked up a 3=

standing right next to another digital video recorder that I leave beside m=

 asked the girl that was with me to check her recording to see if she picke=

=A0
I have long felt the true EVP does not come from sound waves i=

ehow EVP's are appearing directly on the recordings.
=A0
This instance with=
 the recorders may back that theory up. That other recorder should have pic=

=A0
I am attac=
hing the clip of this 3rd voice. The=A0file that is named=A0"01-02-17 Clip"=
 is the full clip.=A0You will hear my voice as I say "Yeah", and then anoth=

=A0

I have a running theory that EVP is carried on an =
untrasonic wave and demodulated exactly where they want it to manifest. It =
works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic waves that di=
ffer one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them together you=
 get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if a ghost is se=
nding a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room creating an =
untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediate difference=
=A0frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20KHz). This=
 was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultrasonic sig=
nals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt that EVP were =
generated within a few inches of the recorder.
=A0
We are able to reproduce=
 this affect in not only radio with superheterodyne systems but also with a=
coustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a commercial produce calle=
d the "audio spotlight" by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.

<DIV>I am curious if anyone =
with a microphone wired to a remote site has ever gotten any EVP in real ti=
me.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>I took part in an investigation =
of Ashmore Estates, near Ashmore IL, on Saturday night. We had six video ca=
meras set up in the three halls of the building. The video for all was=
 being monitored and recorded at a central location. Alas, we did not =
have microphones at the camera sites conected to the central location. I wo=
nder what we might have heard if we did?</DIV>
