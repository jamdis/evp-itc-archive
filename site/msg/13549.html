I have not personally tested the Ovulus, (sp?) but I do believe that more s=
tatistical analysis is called for. 

While using an REG as a control device=
 initially seems to have merit, in that it is supposedly truly random and c=
ould be designed to have statistically the same number of outcomes as the c=
onstrained Ovulus device, we must also recall that research parapsychology =
has demonstrated in the Global Consciousness Project (GCP) highly suggestiv=
e indications that consciousness can indeed affect REGs. 

At minimum, the =
total number of outcomes should be computed=A0to determine the actual degre=
e to which the actual outcomes depart from random chance. This possible dep=
arture would be a good first indication that the device is in fact performi=
ng in what might appear to be an ordinated way. 

Once that had been establ=
ished without consideration to=A0context, it might then be useful to see if=
 these departures from randomness could be associated with the context in w=
hich the device is used. Simply focusing on context does not provide, unfor=
tunately, a robust-enough experiment to allow us the luxuory of declaring m=
ore than a correlation with the historical context of the site. 

From a co=
rrelation point of view I would also suggest that=A0one look for extremely =
specific information and not be prepared to accept as sole evidence very va=
gue statements. Work has been done in this area by Dr. Ian Stevenson late o=
f the University of Virginia in relation to cases suggestive of reincarnati=
on. For analysis purposes, Stevenson developed a ten-point scale that rates=
 anecdotal statements from general to specific free of context. This scale =
would be quite useful in this context as well and would segregate informati=
on that is truly non-specific, information that is truly specific and most =
importantly information that seems specific but is in fact general in scope=
. Mentalists and fraudulent psychics use this last class of information fre=
quently to give their audiences the impression they are providing unique in=
formation when in fact that information is far more general than most reali=
ze and therefore the probability of a 'hit' in strengthened.. 

The same er=
ror can find its way into casual interpretation of otherwise probable rando=
m data, such as interpretations of EVP and general anecdotal statements.
