&gt; Subject: [EVP-ITC] New Subject For Research Sessions
&gt;
&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I have been thinking about what our friends on the other side have
&gt; been saying concerning harmony, resonance and positive vibration.
&gt; While thinking on this and how to achieve amongst us all, I had an
&gt; idea for a new subject of research. I had been thinking about
&gt; spiritual and harmonic energy connection between the spirit world and
&gt; our physical world and contemplating how Mike &amp; Lisa stress the
&gt; importance of this state in the success of better stronger
&gt; communication.
&gt;
&gt; Then the idea of identical twins came to mind and the spiritual and
&gt; sometimes telekinetic bonds that they have been known to share. This
&gt; idea raised two questions in my mind.
&gt;
&gt; 1. is this spiritual and mental energy bond between twins similar to
&gt; the bond we must develop with our spirit counter parts to facilitate
&gt; better, stronger and longer sustained communication.
&gt;
&gt; 2. twins in the womb are conceived when for whatever reason one
&gt; single egg splits into two separate eggs and those two fetuses
&gt; develop independently of each other, but with identical DNA blue
&gt; prints and identical physical characteristics. The question is.
&gt;
&gt; Is their spirit or spiritual energy also divided equally between the
&gt; two individuals that is existent as one spirit divided into two that
&gt; serves as their individual spiritual energy while in the physical and
&gt; then after death is recombined into a single spirit?
&gt;
&gt; Or does the spirit at the time of fetal division become two separate
&gt; and distinct spirits that remain as two individual spirits after
&gt; crossing to the spirit world?
&gt;
&gt; I propose a research experiment involving certain questions to our
&gt; technicians involving this subject matter over say the course of
&gt; three 10 minute sessions. At the end all participants will submit
&gt; their individual responses if any and they can be compared for
&gt; similarity or dissimilarity.
&gt;
&gt; Any researchers interested in this project please let me know, I
&gt; would like to get started within the week.
&gt;
&gt; Bruce
