<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi,

Whew! Thank you, Frank!

I&#x27;ve just changed my group membership from &quot;special notices only&quot; to &quot;daily digest.&quot;  For awhile, I had to stop reading the posts because those two were so negative.

Anyway, I&#x27;m in kind of a whirlwind here in NH, getting ready for Dragon*Con.  If anyone else from this list will be at that event over the Labor Day weekend, please say hello when you see me.  I&#x27;ll be speaking on the Paranormal Track and the Art Show Track... and perhaps a few others.  (Dragon*Con can be fairly spontaneous.)

Cheerfully,
Fiona

&gt;  And that is how ya fix that! I&#x27;m not taking that BS any longer. These self rightous crackheads that are going to tell me what the box really is and how the paranomal really works, while intimidating memebers not to post or discuss anything meaninful. I hit the &quot;remove member&quot; button -twice! I&#x27;ve had it with veiled skeptics and debunkers.
