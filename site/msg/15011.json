It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix two ultrasonic =\r\nwaves that differ one another in frequency then if you add or subtract them=\r\n together you get a beat frequency or alternate frequency. For example, if =\r\na ghost is sending a signal at 54KHz and you have an electric fan in a room=\r\n creating an untrasonic frequency at 45KHz then you will have a intermediat=\r\ne difference frequency at 9KHz, well within human hearing range (20Hz to 20=\r\nKHz). This was just an example, but all electronic equipment generates ultr=\r\nasonic signals just by turning them on. From this theory I always felt that=\r\n EVP were generated within a few inches of the recorder.\n\n                 =\r\n We are able to reproduce this affect in not only radio with superheterodyn=\r\ne systems but also with acoustics and audio as in some passive sonars and a=\r\n commercial produce called the &quot;audio spotlight&quot; by Dr. Joseph Pompeii.\n\n  =\r\n                Frank R.\n\n                  --- On Mon, 6/8/09, Zack Widup =\r\n&lt;w9sz.zack@gmail. com&gt; wrote:\n\n\n                    From: Zack Widup &lt;w9sz.=\r\nzack@gmail. com&gt;\n                    Subject: Re: [EVP-ITC] New ideas\n     =\r\n               To: EVP-ITC@yahoogroups .com\n                    Date: Monda=\r\ny, June 8, 2009, 1:56 PM\n\n\n                    Fascinating!

It works off the heterodyne principle. If you mix=\r\n \n                  two ultrasonic waves that differ one another in frequen=\r\ncy then \n                  if you add or subtract them together you get a b=\r\neat frequency \n                  or alternate frequency. For example, if a =\r\nghost is sending a \n                  signal at 54KHz and you have an elect=\r\nric fan in a room \n                  creating an untrasonic frequency at 45=\r\nKHz then you will have a \n                  intermediate difference&nbsp;fr=\r\nequency at 9KHz, well within \n                  human hearing range (20Hz t=\r\no 20KHz). This was just an example, \n                  but all electronic e=\r\nquipment generates ultrasonic signals just \n                  by turning th=\r\nem on. From this theory I always felt that EVP \n                  were gene=\r\nrated within a few inches of the recorder.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                  &lt;DIV&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                  &lt;DIV&gt;We are able to reproduce this affect in no=\r\nt only radio \n                  with superheterodyne systems but also with =\r\nacoustics and audio \n                  as in some passive sonars and a comm=\r\nercial produce called the \n                  &quot;audio spotlight&quot; by Dr. Josep=\r\nh Pompeii.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                  &lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;Frank R.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Mon, 6/8/09, Zack Widup \n                  &lt;I&gt;&l=\r\nt;w9sz.zack@gmail. com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n                  &lt;BLOC=\r\nKQUOTE \n                    style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: Zack \n                    Widup &lt;w9sz.zack@gmail. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nSubject: Re: [EVP-ITC] \n                    New ideas&lt;BR&gt;To: EVP-ITC@yahoog=\r\nroups .com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Monday, \n                    June 8, 2009, 1:56 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;\n                    &lt;DIV id=3Dyiv100209972&gt;\n                    &lt;DIV id=\r\n=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n                    &lt;DIV&gt;\n                    &lt;DIV&gt;Fascinatin=\r\ng!
