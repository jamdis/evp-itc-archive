<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>All the sweep does is produce a source of human speech, music and 
noise bits that is used as a material that various entities can form 
voices out of(that&#x27;s the theory anyway). Another way is tune a radio 
in between stations on nights where there is distant stations 
fadding in a out randomly, or when there&#x27;s skip (same thing as 
fadding) the sprits will use this as raw audio, short wave would be 
the same. I have one box with shortwave that&#x27;s sweepable. It covers 
the 31, and 49 meter bands. The sweep can also be done just as 
effectively by hand. 

 There&#x27;s seems to be something a bit more going on, such as the 
voices seem to be made inside the electronics, no matter what method 
is being used. Radio seems to be an important medium that seems to 
allow universal access the entities. 

 You can also tune in a shortwave station in a language you do not 
understand, announce you&#x27;re doing an EVP recording, and record 
dierectly from the radio&#x27;s speaker. That will at times produce 
meaningful messages.

 My first advice is to forget all the paranormal BS everyone thinks 
they know, 99% of that is Hollywood, and based only on urban legend. 
Spirit is not some retarted half human thing no longer capable of 
any higher funcition, it is us, the physical side, that is quite 
limited in both thought and action. 

 Oh yeah, spirits travel, there is no need to go the supposedly 
haunted locations. 

 I&#x27;m not a medium, but I am kinda half baked sometimes.
