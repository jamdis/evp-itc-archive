<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Frank,

  I&#x27;m new to the whole paranormal investigation thing.
I did the mod in a radio shack radio and am not sure
of what I&#x27;m getting. I&#x27;ve recorded somethings and had
other people listen to them. I don&#x27;t tell them what I
think it says. Sometimes they hear things I didn&#x27;t
hear. Sometimes they hear what I believed I did hear.
I do log time dates location and moon cycles. weather
conditions...And what I hear....

   What is needed in my own opinion. Is the community
needs to stop all the childish infighting and be
honest with eachother. I think these methods do have
potiential to be an asset to paranormal investigation.
I feel that more research needs to be done and
standards need to be set. The only way this is going
to happen is if we all work together. Putting our
personal feelings and beliefs aside. 

  I&#x27;m stepping down from my soap box now. Thank you
Frank for allowing me to join the group. I would like
to get a Real Box so I can further contribute to this
quest for knowledge......David

&gt; I hear the first one fine.  Sounds like an eastern
&gt; Indian accent.
&gt; Second is clear as well.
&gt; 3Rd &amp; 4th a bit harder but I do hear them as you do.

&gt; I don&#x27;t know, the fact that no one hears the same is
&gt; frustrating. What if it all means nothing!?

&gt; 
&gt; Ok, than i hear it like you do. Isn&#x27;t the idea of
&gt; posting files to get different theories on what is
&gt; heard? What are we comprehending in these or any
&gt; other files anyway? We are just starting to break
&gt; ground on full sentence answers, so we need to sift
&gt; through them and make sense. That one about the
&gt; earthquake is a great file, but what does it mean???
&gt; It doesn&#x27;t make any sense, we have to make sense of
&gt; these files. Whether it be in reverse, enhancing the
&gt; audio or whatever. This is our job as researchers,
&gt; while they laugh their ass off on the other side
&gt; watching us spend hours on the computer to say there
&gt; is going to be an earthquake somewhere that doesn&#x27;t
&gt; happen. If they say &#x27;Steve likes cupcakes in a tree
&gt; in east asia&#x27;, that&#x27;s a great file and it will be
&gt; clear. But what would it mean and what effect will
&gt; it have on humanity.Nuff Said&#x27;-Steve H.--- In
