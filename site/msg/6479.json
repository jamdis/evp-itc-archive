The\n&quot;very bored&quot; part, at least if I&#39;m hearing it correctly, proceeds as\nsoon and the name &quot;Tim&quot; is ending and is at a lot lower decibel level.\n Could be one of those things meant for me to hear, as in I was boring\nthem. It&#39;s any body&#39;s guess.\n\nI got better reception as I did the session at around 8:45pm. \nNighttime seems better for reception around here.  \n\nJeremy\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In EVP-ITC@yahoogroups.com, bruce halliday\n&lt;paranormalinvestigating@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeremy,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I hear the &quot; TIM&quot; very clearly but not the &quot; VERY BORED&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Tim may be your assigned technition, next session ask for\nconformation about\n&gt; a permanant tech and who Tim is.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bruce\n&gt; Bruce Halliday \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To: EVP-ITC@...: ecuyler@...: Tue, 29 Jan 2008 10:20:26\n+0000Subject: [EVP-ITC] Re: New file uploaded to EVP-ITC\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Now that I&#39;ve listened to it some more, I think I hear more stuff,\nbutI&#39;m not sure what.
