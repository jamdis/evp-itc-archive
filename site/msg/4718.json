I just think we don&#39;t know who \nwe&#39;re really comunicating with through the boxes.  It could be space \naliens for all we know. They definitely don&#39;t sound like the EVP&#39;s I&#39;ve \ngotten in haunted places. They are in a class by themselves. Maybe we&#39;ll \nknow for sure some day.\n\nAs for the loved ones, I personally think they hang around for the \nfuneral, then they&#39;re off into a new baby body as fast as they can go. The \nones who hang around and become ghosts are probably in the less than 1% \ncategory of people who do that. The rest are growing up with new parents \nsomewhere and getting to believe in Santa Claus (or whatever) again.\n:-)\n\nZack\n\nOn Mon, 31 Dec 2007, Lisby wrote:\n\n&gt; Perhaps I should have been more specific.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ominous--in reference to the people speaking through the box not being our \n&gt; loved ones who are &quot;somewhere else.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Dec 31, 2007, at 7:38 PM, Ken wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Ominous?

You can&#39;t \n&gt;&gt; have\n&gt;&gt; one without the other. Negativity will always be overpowered by Good & \n&gt;&gt; darkness\n&gt;&gt; will always be illuminated by the light.

I do feel though that the ones that get emotionally moved\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the most are the ones wanting with all their heart to hear from a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; loved one. When these people get an answer that may or may not be\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; heard by all, they feel that it is indeed from a loved one and it\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hits them in the heart as if it was real. I would love to hear a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recorded session from start to finish as an investigator.
