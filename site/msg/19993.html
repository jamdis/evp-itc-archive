I read the instructio=
ns for this thing, and it seems its only a visual indication (via bar-graph=
 LEDs) of the average audio output level from a recorder that has direct mo=
nitoring of recorded sounds (like 3 head recorder) coming out of the headph=
one socket. They say the gizmo only works with recorders that have direct m=
onitoring during record mode. Sooo its a visual guide to what the recorder =
is hearing during a record sesson. Seems not much benefit for $145.
