<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>I think it&#x27;s unrealistic to expect every file to have faces and images.
These faces are often just portions, eyes and lips, some have eye brows.
Like all of this, not done for proof, it&#x27;s for emotional impact.  I have
this woman that shows up in towels, always just half the face. Perahps you
are being too critical? As with all spirit messages, it&#x27;s what it means to
the experiencer that matters. Expecting full faces is like expecting the
kings english and proper grammer in all EVPs.

&gt; I saw a couple which could be construed as images in the one series you had
&gt; from SEA, but nothing that knocked me over the head yet.  I am going to have
&gt; to see a larger sample size before I determine if what you have witnessed is
&gt; in fact a form or not.  I cannot accept an image as paranormal without
&gt; knowing where it sits among the bulk of audio files.  If every file has
&gt; multiple faces, the I would have  to say that there is nothing there.
&gt;
&gt; So, I will certainly keep testing with my copy and hopefully something will
&gt; really pop for me.  I have run through about ten files (EVP and GBC) so far
&gt; for intensive study and I still haven&#x27;t got anything that I would consider a
&gt; positive hit.  I need an actual formed face, not portions thereof, to
&gt; consider an image real.  This is the only way to discount visual matrixing.
&gt;
&gt; I have high hopes for this though!

&gt;&gt;  I&#x27;ve seen live webcast of ITC sessions where GB output is fed directly
&gt;&gt; into the mic line in on a computer running Adobe Audition with the
&gt;&gt; spectragraph running. It was really compelling to see letters and numbers,
&gt;&gt; not images or pictures, but partial words appear in the graph. At first it
&gt;&gt; was I thought it was a software glitch but it is a repeatable event. It was
&gt;&gt; on LiveSciFi which is run by Tim Wood, he also thought there was some kind
&gt;&gt; of code error but it happened on more than one webcast.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So if anyone has Audition, just feed Box output right in your computer and
&gt;&gt; see what happens. I wanted to try it tonight but I have Audacity and the
&gt;&gt; spectragraph feature doesn&#x27;t have that shaded appearance that Audition does
&gt;&gt; so it&#x27;s not able to render images or characters, at least as far as I see
&gt;&gt; using the various settings.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I have tried numerous EVP files and short box clips and so far
&gt;&gt; &gt; nothing discernible has appeared on either program. I still have a lot
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt; hope though.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but I am going to try to work this in to a
