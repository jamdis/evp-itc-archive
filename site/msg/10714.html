<pre style='white-space:pre-wrap;'>Hi all!  I&#x27;ve been incognito for about 2 weeks now and did a quick
session this morning after a long absence because my sister wanted me
to check on something.  Her lights have been flickering in her house
and she thought it was her son Ryan.  She said it was just the lights
- no other appliance was affected when they flickered.  She changed
the bulbs and it still occurred.  So I asked the box and I got some
good messages.

I have wave cleaned them and slowed one down.  I know how some feel
about this but my reception sucks and it helps other people hear so I
went ahead and did it.  But I have the raw - untouched audio saved
separately.

1)  Was Ryan messing with the lights:  YES HE DOES.  ITS HIM.  PLAYS
WITH THE LIGHTS.

2)  A message for his mom?
     A)  HURRY UP BOY PLEASE.  I AM HERE.. HERE... DAD. (this one is
rough.. sorry)
     b)  RYAN (is) SOR... RY  ryan is   BETTER.
     c)  YOU&#x27;LL BE HAPPY AGAIN.</pre>
