I have gotten many life like voices over the years. My first evp was my mot=
hers voice and no boxes were involved. The box is=A0a tool/method and there=
 are many ways to get their voices heard. So in the different methods I hav=
e used, yes I have heard voices that resemble their lifetime charachteristi=
cs and tones. Is it always that way? No. 
=A0
Most often the group will=A0s=
peak as one voice because I have requested they do so.=A0One voice tone wil=
l begin a sentence and another will end it. So I may hear my female friends=
 voice start off a thought and an unknown male voice finish the sentence. A=
nd vice versa often they speak in tones which do not even come close to wha=
t they sounded like in life. Quite often they are spirits I didnt know in l=
ife. I may get someone saying This is edison, and then find an old recordin=
g he did where he starts it off saying This is edison, but for me I do not =
know the man so there is no recognition for me. I document it and file it a=
way as a curiousity.

in touch after death. If one is possible then so is the other. I tend to be=
=A0stubborn in some respects in that I dont instantly believe what anyone t=

I do find they often resume t=

I was googling about AM radio reception, and I came across the below exc=
hange on a forum. It talks about using the box to find missing persons (whi=
ch I didn't know was possible), and the conversation mentions hearing speci=

 box. My question is, do any of you get a recognizable voice? The voices I =
get always sound robotic, although I do get clearly male or female voices. =
