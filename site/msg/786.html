 I'm going to start posting a few things about Alec's work with the 
 Alpha Interface Unit he developed.
 
 Here's an article from Fate magazine (July 1, 2000):
 
 "The Alpha Mystery" by Jose Feola
 
 http://www.llewellyn.com/archive/fate/38/
 
 Plus I'm adding 2 papers Alec has written about EVP and the Alpha 
 Unit (particularly of importance is the capturing of EVP in a 
 soundproof Faraday cage):
 
 "A Bio-electromagnetic Device of Unusual Properties" (published in 
 the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research)
 
 http://www.skyelab.co.uk/review/aa.htm
 
 "Report of an Anomalous Speech Products Experiment inside a Double 
 Screened Room"
 
 http://www.skyelab.co.uk/review/bb.htm
 
 You can also buy Alec's book and EVP sampler CD online:

 Next time - I'll post about Alec's funded EVP research project 
 called "The Intelligence Project" along with charts and the samples 
 that the international listening panel (which I was a member of) 
 judged. Hopefully - he'll be sending me both the interim report and 
 final report so I can put them in the "Files" area.
