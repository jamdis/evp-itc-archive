In response to Frank's =
last statement, I just want to say I sincerely hope my posts aren't the one=
s upsetting you. If they are, please tell me. The last thing I would want i=
s to cause frustration and bad feelings, and if my posts are a source of th=
ese things, I'd rather stop posting than upset anyone. I'm here to learn, a=
nd I can certainly do that without contributing to the conversation.
