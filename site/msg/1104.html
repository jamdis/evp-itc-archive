  good evidence which some may have oppurtunity to try:
   
  a crystal earphone from radio shack-used with crystal radio- is small enough to transduce sound up to about 25khz.
   
  a sherlock holmes type large magnifying glass will concentrate ultrasound, hence ghost voice, onto crystal earphone.  it will make it louder but not more intelligible.
   
  all optical lenses prisms etc work equally well with sound if the wavelength is smaller than the lens.  practically speaking, using familiar items, this means 8khz and up.
   
  sleeping dogs and other small animals (whose smaller hearing mechanics can accommodate smaller wavelengths) are awakened by ghosts some way; like wise small children.
