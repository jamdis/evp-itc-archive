I'd buy this:

http://cg=
i.ebay.com/Edirol-R-09-Handheld-Digital-Recorder-/150528856926?pt=3DVoice_R=
ecorders&hash=3Ditem230c38135e

This is what i've used since day one, it's =
fantastic ! It records mono or stereo in any format you want.

My favorite =
part is the SD card, i just pop it out and put it into my computer to uploa=
d. Takes a few seconds to copy it to your hard drive. I use 128 bit mp3 for=
mat for my recordings.
