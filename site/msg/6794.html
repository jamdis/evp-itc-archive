Ya got me a bit confused Ann, easy to do.  This email was about me not being able to open your MP3 files.  You later sent me several files you said were "random" and I could open and listen to all of them...no problem.  I never did find out how you did that and if you will keep doing it on the forum so I can open them.  I still cannot open Steve's files. None. The suggestion that was made by someone about the problem at your end when using audacity or other editing program that affect the signal and file is probably valid.  I will go to your other email and answer it directly.  Ron

  Not sure about an MP3 player on my computer but I have MS Media Center and Windows Media Player to handle music etc.  Don't know much more about how to handle your MP3 files.  I suppose your apple is more sophisticated.  If others are opening your file I would think I should be able to also. 
   
  I just checked another member's file and I was able to open and listen to her MP3 file.  So something else is up with you and me.  Also, you had sent me a file via personal email and I am able to open and listen to it.  Will keep trying.   Ron L
